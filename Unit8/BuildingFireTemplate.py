	The following code is used to filter words by their Parts of Speech (POS) tag. This is useful because, for example,
	we can ignore any "location" data that is not a noun, as we know that a verb would not be useful in describing a location.
	However, the reason that is not used is because when tagging words individually with POS, we lose context.

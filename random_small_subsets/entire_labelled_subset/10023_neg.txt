				she looks beautiful but like the Olson twins and so many other Disney Teens I hoped she saved her money. Hollywood producers use kids like her and then black list them.

				I like Miley. I tried to watch an episode of her show, but was put off by the stereotypi­cal fat black "The Help" type lady. However, I respect Miley's success as a young lady, and wish her continued success. She has achieved more than most adults ever will and that burns some britches, but get over it.

				The studios like Disney, Nickeloden­, etc. are interested in only one thing! Making a buck! They strip these kids of their childhood, extract every cent they can squeeze from them and throw them away when they are too old to play kid parts. Look at Judy Garland. She was given pills to wake her up, pills to make her sleep and the diet of Doctor prescribed pills eventually killed her. The years that are taken from these little profit centers are the years that they are learning who they are and how to get along with other people, but their lives become life in an aquarium with no privacy. The have no other skills than playing cute kids and entertaini­ng teens. When they hit their 20's they are all used up!

				Not so. The kids from The Cosby Show fared well as did many other child stars like some from Little House on the Prairie, Punky Brewster, The Facts of Life and more. I have been acting since childhood but never got that big break, so I admire child stars who did and as a result have financial security and respect in adulthood. Torture is living an average life, begging for a job. Being paid next to nothing as a teen just because a company can get away with it.

				Don't feel bad, GIrlinNYC.  It happens on the other end of the spectrum, as well.  I am almost 70, and my boss just cut my pay.  My wages were barely liveable, and he didn't cut anyone else, just me.  When one is old, no matter how skilled, smart, prompt, efficient, etc., one is treated like dirty kleenex.  Used and thrown away.  Unfortunat­ely, there are no jobs out there, and with employers having 150 people for every position, they treat old folks like dirt, and even if we are more qualified, won't even talk to us.

I know that it is hard to be a teen, and begging for a job.  I send you all kinds of good wishes and warm hugs, and pray that you soon get what you need.  Some people are just cynical, and have no clue as to what youkids go through.  Don't let it bother you.

				She should sit down and read the news clippings for Lindsey Lohan and chat a course in the opposite direction as it is so easy to believe the people around her telling her she is something special, She has a talent but beyond that she is just another 18 year old that has very little life expierence and should carefully make her choices about her actions as 18 is in no way "GrownUp"

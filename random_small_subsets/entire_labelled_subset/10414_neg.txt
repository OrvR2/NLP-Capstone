Best Management Practices...
What are they and what good do they do?
The economy of East Texas depends on its forests and the wood they produce. Many people dislike the idea of cutting trees but we still use wood products every day in our lives. Therefore, we place a demand as consumers on the forest industry to meet our needs. They supply us with products made from the raw materials in trees. The good thing about this is that trees are a renewable resource. Unlike many of our other natural resources, trees can be grown, harvested, and grown again to be harvested again and again for an indefinite period of time. Wood products are biodegradable materials that won’t be around for thousands of years before they decompose and many can also be recycled.
Trees are extremely valuable to us in numerous other ways. One of these ways is the role they play in providing clean water for us to drink. The trees in the immediate area of streams help to filter out many pollutants before they enter the stream. They also provide shade which helps the water temperatures to remain constant. This is important to water quality because colder water can hold more dissolved oxygen which is vital to the survival of aquatic life.
Can we cut down trees and have clean water at the same time? Absolutely! Best Management Practices (BMPs) are voluntary guidelines for landowners, foresters, loggers and others to use in order to help protect water quality from various types of pollution. If the recommendations in the BMP guidelines are followed, water quality can be protected. However, people must be informed of Best Management Practices and the importance of their use for them to be effective.
Using BMPs is beneficial not only to the quality of our drinking water, but also to the quality of our land in general. BMPs prevent erosion of valuable topsoil and also control erosion on roads. All of this soil can eventually find its way into streams, causing problems for aquatic organisms and making the treatment of our drinking water more expensive. For more information on Best Management Practices, read the support literature or contact your local Texas Forest Service office.

 
Terms and Definitions
Copy the following terms and definitions and memorize each.

Best Management Practices (BMPs)- a voluntary set of guidelines designed to help landowners, foresters, loggers and others protect water quality during forestry operations.


Forestry- the science, art, and practice of managing and using for human benefit the natural resources that occur on and in association with forest lands.


Streamside Management Zone (SMZ)- a Best Management Practice recommending that a strip of trees be left along each side of a stream to reduce erosion, decrease sedimentation, and prevent wide changes in water temperatures.


Thermal Pollution- a temperature change in a body of water which is sufficient enough to be harmful to aquatic life.


Sedimentation- soil particles which have been deposited in an area by moving water.


Erosion- the detachment and transport of soil particles from an area by force of water and gravity.


Nutrients- mineral elements which are needed by plants in order to survive and grow.


Pollution- the presence of substances in the water, soil, or air which when in certain quantities becomes harmful to the natural quality of the environment and those organisms that live there.


Point Source Water Pollution- a type of pollution in which the source of the pollutant can be traced to a specific location (such as a factory discharge pipe).


Non-Point Source Water Pollution- a type of pollution in which the source of the pollutant cannot be traced to a specific location (pollution from a very broad area).


Benthic- of, relating to, or occurring on the bottom of a body of water.


Watershed- all of the land and water contained within an area which will drain to one specified location.

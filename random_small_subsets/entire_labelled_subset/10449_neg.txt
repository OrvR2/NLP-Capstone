FERAL HOGS









[ Print | 

 ]



Texas is home to an estimated 2 million feral hogs (Sus scrofa).
Feral hogs may be found in nearly every Texas county making up nearly 50 percent of all the feral hogs in the United States.
The population and range of feral hogs have expanded dramatically
because they are extremely adaptable animals with a high reproductive rate.
Relocation by hunters, disease control in domestic animals, the management
of rangelands, and habitat improvements made for livestock and wildlife also
have helped feral hogs.
Hogs are prized by hunters but despised by landowners
who suffer from their damage.

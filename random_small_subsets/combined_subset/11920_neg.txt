Winklevoss twins appear in nutty TV commercial, muse over idea theftBy Mike Wehner, Tecca | Today in Tech – 18 hrs ago


Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss may have seen their hopes of partial ownership in Facebook go down the drain, but they're making the best of their newfound celebrity in a new ad for Wonderful Pistachios. The twins are a household name due to their much publicized claim of being the original founders of Facebook, which has repeatedly been met with resistance from judges as well as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
In the brief commercial, one of the "Winklevii" cracks a nut in a unique way, and the other admires his technique. The twins then celebrate their new finding, and consider the fact that someone might steal it. "Who would do that?" they say in unison before the announcer steps in to close the ad.
The former Olympic rowing hopefuls probably aren't hurting for money — they received a generous settlement from Facebook in the form of stock which is now valued at well over $100 million. With their case for ownership of the social network now decidedly dead, the twins have nothing left to do but make light of the situation. The short nut advertisement achieves that soundly.
The Winklevoss brothers aren't the first celebrities to appear in lighthearted Wonderful Pistachios ads. Comedian Lewis Black, NFL star Chad Ocho Cinco, and Jersey Shore's Snooki have also cracked nuts for the company. Though the twins' version most certainly wins the award for being the most passive-aggressive.

Facebook is a fad that will die soon. Its for idiots that want to "share" irrelevant crap about their meaningless lives and are giving up their privacy in the process. The fate of Facebook was sealed the minute they started doing sites for corporations! DUMB #$%$ CORPORATE SELLOUTS!Zuckerberg is a swine who screws everyone around him. He learned from Gates who tried to screw one of his original partners out of his shares when the guy got cancer!Regarding the twins, they got paid to do a commercial. SO WHAT?They did the right thing by suing Zuckerdick.  Too bad they didn't get a bigger settlement. I advise them to cash out now before Facebook starts going down in value. Its "fifteen minutes" is going to be over soon. Ever hear of MySpace?

They attended Harvard and, if you believe the twins, they had the genius to come up with the Facebook phenomenon (but not the commonsense to patent their idea).

If the twins were so smart, they would not have given a multi-billion dollar company away for pennies on the dollars. Sorry twins, being pretty does not equal being smart.

Seven members of a Hispanic family from Los Angeles became victims of a mistaken drug raid at a home in the city of Norco in Riverside County by nearly 40 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Homeland Security, Immigration (HSI) agents.

"Where's the money? Where are the drugs?" the agents shouted at a terrified Carmen Bonilla. At about 3:45 in the afternoon, Bonilla, of Mexican origin, and her daughter-in-law, Leticia, were cooking in anticipation of their husbands' arrival from work. The agent insurrection would end at 7 that evening.
"I heard pounding and kicking at the door; I became very frightened and when I opened the door, I saw that it was the police," recalled Bonilla tearfully, as she showed areas of her body where she'd allegedly been struck by agents. "I asked them, 'What did we do? What did we do? What did we do?' " she intimated. "I didn't open the door out of fear.

They simply grabbed me by the arm, threw me on the ground, handcuffed me and slammed me up against the wall."
Bonilla said she implored the agents to let her turn off the stove and grab her granddaughter, who was screaming in fear. "Shut up or we'll shoot you! We have orders to shoot," she said at a news conference. "I begged them to let me get to my granddaughter, but they did not understand me and continued to beat me," she said.
Michael Martinez, a 16-year-old Norco High School student, said he was in back of the house when he heard the commotion. He was getting ready to go to a football game.
"Get down on the ground!" he remembered, as four agents descended on him and immediately handcuffed him. "I heard my mother's screams as the baby was crying in fear, not knowing what to do. When they finally left, we had to take my mom to the hospital; she suffers from diabetes."
 Armed with a search warrant, ICE and HSI agents scoured the Bonilla home. The agents produced the warrant to Josefina Martinez, Carmen Bonilla's daughter, after the odyssey was over and they were retreating.
 "I was in the kitchen when they said to open the door or they would shoot," said daughter-in-law Leticia Hernandez. "I saw them hit her [Carmen Bonilla]. They said they had orders to shoot. I saw them kicking her. I was inside and the baby was crying. They aimed their guns at me if I wasn't quiet," she said. "Where are the guns? Where is the money?"
"I told them there was nothing in the house," Hernandez said.
The agents found neither the dealer, nor evidence of any crime. However, the Bonilla family must appear Tuesday before immigration officials, who seek to deport them from the United States.
Rights Trampled
Jessica Dominguez, an immigration expert and attorney, is representing the Bonilla family in the case.
"In the family's interview [with ICE agents], we can obtain all the information they have, and determine the information they obtained illegally. For now, I cannot respond to the legal arguments [of the deportation process the family is undergoing]," Dominguez said.
"Throughout my entire career I have insisted that the community learn what its rights are and how it can exercise those rights without fear," the attorney said. "In [Carmen] Bonilla's case, she asked, implored, pleaded that they listen to her, but her rights were systematically ignored and trampled."

Last month, ICE director John Morton circulated a memorandum to all ICE special agents in charge of their offices and their attorneys, calling for his officials to exercise judicial discretion when deciding immigration cases.

The June 17 memo enumerates a series of positive and negative scenarios in which officials are to use their discretion, including the duration of the person's presence in the United States, with attention to the extension of a person's right to stay in the country legally; the circumstances leading to their arrival in the United States, particularly if the foreigner arrived as a child; educational pursuits, with the eventual graduation from high school, college or university in the country; or whether the person is a U.S. military officer or family member of an officer.
"ICE's cowardice knows no limits. They are not following the discretionary directives set forth by ICE director John Morton," said Jorge Mario Cabrera, spokesman for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. "It hurts us to see this type of abuse, and this case so especially fraught with civil rights violations."
The negative factors outlined in the memorandum also apply, including whether the individual has a criminal record; a poor immigration history that includes deportations; the denial of past or present immigrant status due to fraud; and if the person represents a danger to national security and the public.

In a written statement to AOL Latino, Lori K. Haley, public affairs officer and spokeswoman for the Western Region of the Department of Homeland Security, said: "Because the criminal investigation is ongoing, and the fact the family has made allegations of inappropriate conduct on the part of ICE and HSI agents, what we can say about the incident is limited."
"We've contacted our attorney in Washington to see if we can shed more light on this brief statement. We are hoping to issue journalists a copy of the search warrant, but we've been told that as of this moment the warrant is sealed. If we receive authorization to clarify our statement, we will send additional information," the statement said.
The full text of Haley's statement said, "Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents for the Department of Homeland Security went to a residence on Corona Avenue in Norco, Calif., Tuesday (July 19) to execute a search warrant related to an ongoing federal investigation.
"In the execution of their official duty, the ICE agents and officials uphold themselves to the highest standards of professional conduct. If persons involved believe that ICE personnel has acted improperly or illegally, the agency encourages that those issues be reported to the ICE Office of Official Responsibility, or the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security. All allegations of misconduct will be investigated thoroughly and, if substantiated, appropriate action will be taken."

The Bonilla family is outraged.
"We haven't committed any crime in this country. We had just moved into that house July 1," said Josefina Martinez. "They harassed us with the threat of returning if we spoke [publically about the case]." She said the Bonilla family wouldn't be satisfied with a public apology from ICE, "especially when my mother is all beaten up and they tell you that you have no rights. They destroyed my family ... they changed our lives forever."
Martinez says that now, every time there's a knock at the door, everyone in the family is in terror. "This hurts too much. And what's worse is as they were leaving, they were laughing about what they had done," she said.
The accusations made by residents against the agents authorized by the court to conduct the search have been referred to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility for further investigation.
Homeland Security investigators determined that eight of the occupants living in the home were in the United States illegally. Four adult men were detained at the scene and held for deportation.
"For humanitarian reasons, the other four individuals found in the home were issued summonses to appear in court at a later date with ICE [officials] for processing. Those cases will be presided over by an immigration judge, who will determine if the four have a legal basis to remain in the United States."

				Should read "Illegal Hispanic Family Terrorized by ICE"

There is no moratorium on deportatio­ns.

Special order 40 is not an immigratio­n silver bullet just a directive to local police not to stop people solely for the purpose of checking immigratio­n status. 

"What did we do? What did we do? What did we do?"  - broke the law lady!

				I'd like to hear the authoritie­s side of this because we know that anything presented on here is cherry picked. The article said a drug raid was conducted, so who had jurisdicti­on, the police, the DEA, ICE, who was in charge? If these people are here legally, why would they thus be having to appear before an immigratio­n judge? There is a lot here that isn't being reported. Why is that? I'll bet before this story reaches court, the family will 'swear' that they were all shot at!"Homeland Security investigat­ors determined that eight of the occupants living in the home were in the United States illegally.­"...Ummm, hello! That throws a mighty big wrench into their claims about how innocent they are, although, in fairness, there will now be a court proceeding to determine guilt or innocence.Here's another source and what it is reporting. Some things are indeed presented just a tad differentl­y than on here..http://art­icles.sfga­te.com/201­1-08-01/ne­ws/2984135­5_1_immigr­ation-agen­ts-drug-ra­id-immigra­tion-statu­s"During the search at the home, immigratio­n agents arrested four male relatives for investigat­ion of being in the country illegally, Bonilla's immigratio­n attorney Jessica Dominguez said.""Carmen Bonilla told reporters in Spanish at a press conference Monday that roughly 40 armed agents stormed the house in Norco July 19 pointing guns at her and threatenin­g to shoot."That says it all, I reckon..

I'll bet you will lose that bet.

Why does the fact that the Carmen Bonilla spoke in spanish at the press conference "say it all"?  They are *immigrant­s*.  What does the informatio­n that she spoke in spanish add to the story?

				Two US states have two languages --- Hawaii's languages are English & Hawaiian and New Mexico's langauges are English & Spanish.  In Louisiana and Maine, French is essentiall­y recognized as a de facto second "official" tongue.  In addition, the Commonweal­th of Puerto Rico also recognizes both Spanish and English, with Spanish being predominan­t, while English and native tongues are recognized in Guam, Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands.  Finally, in native American and Eskimo reservatio­ns, both English and the native tongues are recognized­.  What's not the official language in our country, simply because we've always been too diverse to make it workable?  English, although almost all immigrants are primarily English-on­ly by the 3rd generation­, just as it has always been throughout our history.  What are y'all so frightened of?

				To all the complainin­g people, you are just lucky to have been born in the USA.  We Americans take everything for granted and still want more.  People from other countries just want a better life..If we had to live as they do in there country of origin, we would not survive.  Be thankful to our forefather­s who had more compassion than people today, otherwise you would not be American either.  I just dont understand what makes people so bitter and angry.  Most of the law breakers are  US citizens, but we only get sent to jail, not deported.

				Oh puleeze. So you think every native-bor­n American comes into a rosy picture here? Allowing unlimited Mexicans will solve NOTHING. More will come, more will create large families here. That is a sore spot with many Americans. If the man wants to come and do seasonal work then maybe. But why bring the whole family? Why impregnate women and risk "breaking up families" if one gets deported? Why do Mexicans get all militant against the USA but in their country they are silent towards the injustices over there?

				"but in their country they are silent towards the injustices over there"

Probably because people who try to speak up or enforce laws in Mexico tend to get murdered.

				ICE & HSI had a warrant, these  illegals chose not to obey direct orders and required physical restraint.  Their lawyer, an "immigrati­on expert"  claims their "rights" were trampled. What "rights" were those, exactly? What kind of immigratio­n "expert" doesn't know that ILLEGALS are breaking the law and HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHTS. (And while it's not really clear in this story, 8 of the occupants are illegal, but if there were any legal residents there, they were knowingly harboring criminals)­.
(Liberals, please note, I said LEGAL rights, not "human or civil rights", 3 completely different arenas).

				The US has traditiona­lly and by treaty stated we will honor those "human or civil" rights you seem to discount; that means that they do have rights under our law and within our courts.  Besides, are you really comfortabl­e not granting basic rights that we proclaimed to the world as universal?  That makes us look even more willing to trample on our founding beliefs than the mess in Guantanamo does.

				"Last month, ICE director John Morton circulated a memorandum to all ICE special agents in charge of their offices and their attorneys, calling for his officials to exercise judicial discretion when deciding immigratio­n cases."

What does that mean?
Selective enforcemen­t of the laws?
According to the COTUS, it is up to the judicial branch to interpret the law, not these bureaucrat­s.

This type of "directive­" is a microcosm representa­tive of the end run this administra­tion is doing with our nation's laws.

Um, yes you have if you are not here legally.I wonder if any illegal documents were found,fake drivers licenses,S S cards belonging to someone else,ect.W­hy do these people feel that they should be treated differntly than anybody else?Why do they feel entitled to be here in the first place?If you are here illegally,­go home NOW before it gets worse.And it will get worse,the writing is on the wall(in english).

				"...I don't see the term 'ILLEGAL' anywhere."  You obviously didn't read the story.  

"F­irst off the family refused to open the door to ICE Agents."  Would you open to folks pounding on a door and demanding it be opened or they'll shoot you?

"The­n there was a language barrier because they don't speak English."  The story doesn't say anything along those lines and in fact states they did speak to the agents in English.  Your assumption­s show your prejudices­.

'...di­ffu­sing the whole situation.­"  What you wrote isn't what you meant.  Look it up.  Learn the grammar and spelling of your own native tongue before going after those "others" you seem to fear so much.  The Irish and the Italians and even the Germans faced the same stuff and the antagonism towards immigrants it did us no credit then as a nation and does us no credit now.

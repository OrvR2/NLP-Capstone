How much will it cost to have Nicki Minaj, Trina, or Lil Kim at my Sweet Sixteen Birthday party?

30. May, 2011                            0 Comments








My birthday is coming up in September and I want to have an unforgettable 16th birthday party. I really wanted Lil Wayne to perform, but he's now in jail. so next in line is Nicki Minaj! I adore her and I know with her at my party NO ONE will ever top it in my city. If not her, maybe other big artists could possibly perform. I just need to know how much!

Daily Horoscope for September 12

 Aries
Your health, or lack of it, comes to light with today's Full Moon... it's time to take a good look at your daily habits and the effect that they having on your system. Saturn and Jupiter are trying to tell you that you're burning the candles at both ends... the stress many of you are under right now is enough to give anyone an ulcer! Slow down and listen to what your body is telling you.


 Taurus
Today's Full Moon brings potential for romance. If you are married, don't miss this opportunity to show your mate that he or she is still your sweetheart. If you are single, it won't hurt to send signals out to the one you are interested in. This is also a very creative and fertile time. If you are trying to get pregnant, tonight may be the night. If you already have children, spend quality time with them! Beneficial colors include lilac and rose pink. Lucky numbers are 5 and 3.


 Gemini
Today's Full Moon may have you facing personal feelings you have been trying to ignore. You can distract yourself with all the friends and fun you like, but something seems to be bothering you. Take time to really think about who you are, what you want out of life, and where you seem to be headed. You may want to spend more time with your parents.


 Cancer
Today's Full Moon may bring personal differences to the surface, but this can be a good thing. If you and your associates can keep an open mind, all parties involved can learn and grow. Avoid people who are only interested in making you see their point of view. In the same way, do not try to force your beliefs or opinions on anyone.


 Leo
Today's Full Moon activates the energy in your eighth house of sex, money and power. You need to pay attention to your gut instincts when it comes to these matters. If you're involved in a power struggle, step back today before you get in too deep. Often the best way to win, is simply not to play the game.


 Virgo
Today's Full Moon places your most significant relationships in the spotlight. You'll need to find a balance between your needs and the needs of your mate, best friend, or partner if you want to continue to grow together. Don't let the pressures of the outside world keep you from putting the effort into your closest relationships and making the changes that are necessary.


 Libra
Today's Full Moon brings health issues to the surface... if you haven't been taking care of yourself, don't be surprised if you're feeling less than bright eyed and bushy tailed. Relationships at work may also be under strain. Take what happens during the next twenty four hours as your wake up call!


 Scorpio
Today's Full Moon has the potential to be very, very romantic for many of you. This is also a fertile, creative Moon, so if you are trying to start a family, this may be the night. Spending time with your favorite friends and associates could be the best inspiration, so make time for those who know and love you well.


 Sagittarius
Today's Full Moon may bring your private life into the public eye; you may want to be very discreet in order to avoid embarrassment. Many of you may be dealing with a personal crisis and you may be experiencing profound changes in your friendships, especially if financial concerns have entered the frame. Consult your favorite astrologer for more information.


 Capricorn
Today's Full Moon may force you to speak up, even if that's the last thing you feel like doing. It may be a matter of 'speak now or forever hold your peace', so don't be shy. Those of you who were born in the mid 60's may feel this transit very acutely, as natal Pluto will be activated. If you feel you are becoming overwhelmed or need guidance, consider consulting your favourite astrologer.


 Aquarius
Today's Full Moon brings your resources and the resources of others into focus. You may be experiencing a power struggle of some sort. In any case, now is the time to put all your cards on the table. Be honest with yourself and then be honest with others. Many of you will begin to reap the rewards of all your hard work now.


 Pisces
Today's Full Moon may bring your most significant relationships into focus. This is a good time to listen to your mate, best friend or partner. He or she may be more willing to open up to you. Healing and growth can come through these shared moments. Do not be afraid to make yourself vulnerable to the ones you love. It is in this that you have strength.

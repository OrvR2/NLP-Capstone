Texas Task Force 1 Deployed to Search Town Destroyed by Wildfire
No comments






Texas Task Force 1 has been deployed to Bastrop, Texas (Near Austin) to conduct a search of the scorched town.  Approximately 700 homes haves have been destroyed by the wildfire.
The State of Texas has been a leader in enhancing their US&R Task Force as a State asset, as well as taking advantage of the teams robust capabilities for other types of major emergencies.  Check out this 2006 article in Fire Chief magazine where TX-TF1 Task Force Leaders talk about the ability for local fire departments to request the State to deploy TX-TF1 as well the need to cross train TX-TF1 members in water rescue.  If Governor Perry ends up in the White House, lets hope he takes these concepts with him.

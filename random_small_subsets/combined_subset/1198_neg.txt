Now thats how you start a rivalry.San Diego State football coach Rocky Long took a shot at Boise States famous blue turf during the Mountain West Conferences coaches teleconference Tuesday. While praising the addition of the Broncos this fall, Long said: I think they ought to get rid of that blue turf. I think it's unfair.People think Im crazy when I say this, but other coaches say the same thing. I think the visiting team takes a quarter to get the feel of that turf, said Long, who coached New Mexico to a 20-9 loss at Bronco Stadium in 1999. He said players track the ball differently on the blue.Boise State installed the blue turf in 1986. The Broncos are 69-2 at home since 2000, the highest home winning percentage in the country. Boise State went 40-0 at home in conference games during its 10-year WAC tenure. "Certain places have a mystique that makes it harder to play there, whether its the stadium size or the ambiance inside," Boise State coach Chris Petersen said. If its an advantage, great."Boise State plays at San Diego State on Nov. 19.

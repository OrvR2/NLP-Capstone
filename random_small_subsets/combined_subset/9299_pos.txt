You also can contact your local utility company, financial institution or insurance provider and speak with a customer service representative for copies of your most recent records. The utility company should have your most recent utility bill; your bank, credit union, or savings and loan should provide you with copies of your bank statements, loan applications, and mortgage payment receipts; and your insurance company should have your insurance policies, recent billing statements, and cash-value statements.
FEMA's mission is to support our citizens and first responders to ensure that as a nation we work together to build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards.Last Modified: Wednesday, 28-Sep-2011 14:44:28

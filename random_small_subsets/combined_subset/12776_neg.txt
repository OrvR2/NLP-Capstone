9/11 Too 'Meaningless' to Inspire Great Novels
Because 'life, not death, is the novelist's subject': Laura Miller

(Newser) -
                                    Ten years later, and still no great 9/11 novels? Yes, because "at its heart, 9/11 was meaningless," writes Laura Miller at  Salon .

This Day Is Stained by Shame
What happened after the attacks was unforgivable: Paul Krugman

(Newser) -
                                    For many Americans, the 10th anniversary of September 11 comes shrouded in feelings of grief and loss, but the overwhelming emotion for Paul Krugman is shame.

(Newser) -
                                    After 9/11, a "cabal of extremist billionaires" escalated a class war that has crushed the American people and threatened the world, Gerald Caplan writes in the  Globe & Mail .

                                    Charles Krauthammer issues an emphatic rebuttal to what he calls the "new conventional wisdom" about 9/11—that the US overreacted and brought upon itself a ruinous decade of war and financial misery.

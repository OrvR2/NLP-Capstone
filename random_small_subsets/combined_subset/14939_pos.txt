Texas Fire in Nolan County is typical of all the Texas brushfires and wildfires literally sweeping the state. This 3,000 Acre ranch near San Angelo burned to the ground in 35 minutes by wildfires! Wildfires in Texas, especially West Texas have caused an environmental nightmare of destruction and loss. Over 400 animals died in this wildfire, and many structures and vehicles were also destroyed by the Texas brushfire. It looked like a nuclear wasteland. Over the next 12-18 months we will be redeveloping this ranch as a "before and after" project, so stay tuned! Texas fires are causing massive damage all over the great state of Texas. Texas VFD's (Volunteer Fire Departments) have been stretched to their limits in fighting the Texas fires, with wildfires being caused by carelessness, accidents and lightning strikes in the dry drought conditions in most all of Texas. The destruction is the same and the Texas wildfires have become an epidemic, but maybe we can revitalize one ranch at a time.

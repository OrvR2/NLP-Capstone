BRUSSELS — Honey that contains traces of pollen from genetically modified crops needs special authorization before it can be sold in Europe, the European Union's top court said Tuesday, in a judgment that could have widespread consequences on the bloc's policy on genetically modified organisms, or GMOs.
The ruling from the European Court of Justice came after several Bavarian beekeepers demanded compensation from their government for honey and food supplements that contained traces of pollen from genetically modified maize.
The beekeepers had their hives close to fields where the Bavarian government was growing Monsanto's MON 810 maize for research purposes.
The EU has strict guidelines on authorizing and informing consumers about foods containing GMOs – a policy that has caused problems for producers of genetically modified seeds such as U.S.-based Monsanto Co. that are used to much laxer rules in other parts of the world.
Kelli Powers, a spokeswoman for Monsanto, said the company could not provide detailed comment on the ruling until the firm had a chance to read the entire judgment.
But Powers emphasized that the company's engineered corn seed has been approved as safe for human consumption.
"...the safety of MON 810 is confirmed by multiple regulatory approvals, including those in the EU, and by up to 15 years of successful commercial use and consumption of MON810 corn products in the EU and around the world," Powers said in an e-mail.
Environmental activists said Tuesday's ruling will force the 17-country European Union to strengthen the rules even further at a time they worried the bloc was dropping its zero-tolerance policy toward GMOs.
"This is a victory for beekeepers, consumers and the movement for GMO-free agriculture in Europe," Mute Schimpf, a food campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, said in a statement. "This ruling rewrites the rule book and gives legal backing to stronger measures to prevent contamination from the likes of Monsanto."
 Earlier this year, the EU approved rules to allow the import of animal feed contaminated with small traces of genetically modified crops – a move that was heavily criticized by environmental groups.
The EU and feed suppliers argued that a loosening of the ban was necessary because it was difficult to prevent minute traces of GMOs from finding their way into large shipments from overseas.
In its judgment on the honey, the Luxembourg-based court however seemed to take a stricter view.
The EU's "authorization scheme for foodstuffs containing ingredients produced from GMOs applies irrespective of whether the pollen is introduced intentionally or adventitiously into the honey," it said in its ruling.
The obligation to get special permission to sell the honey exists "irrespective of the proportion of genetically modified material contained in the product in question," the court added.

				In Jane Goodall’s 2005 book "Harvest for Hope:  A Guide to Mindful Eating", she writes that when two troughs of feed are presented to zoo animals, one containing GM and one containing non-GM grain, the animals don’t touch the GM stuff.   They know.   Consumers shy away from GM food when they can afford organic-- and many people of modest means are deeply regretful when they have to feed their families GM foods.   They know.

The Monsanto spokeswoma­n’s proof that GM foods are ludicrous.   It was approved by multiple regulators (!!)  and has had 15 years of “successfu­l commercial use”!!  Wow!   What proof!

GM was approved in the US before independen­t or rigorous scientific testing was done,  and  every independen­t test since    (even some commission­ed by the industry, which are then buried) have rung loud alarm bells. Thanks to our non-regula­tors  we have been treated like a nation of guinea pigs, and may have messed up the food chain and human and animal health for generation­s.

				Monsanto's central product Round Up has been found to cause birth defects. What happens when you eat GMO foods that are "Round Up Ready"? I don't know. It's a gamble. I love to gamble in the casino, but I never gamble anything I am not prepared to loose. So until further testing I will say no to GMO.

				considerin­g that Monsanto sues thousands of farmers each year because of pollen contaminat­ion it just might be.  Monsanto has put ten's of thousands of small farmers out of business because of this cross contaminat­ion.  they even have teams at work in each country and in each state in the USA that actively seeks out this pollution by trespassin­g on the property, stealing samples of the farmers plants, and then if they find even the slightest bit of a cross they are allowed to shut the farmer down, destroy ALL of his plants and effectivel­y devastate these small farms.  the farmers are also required by law to turn over ALL seed stock and pay Monsanto it's royalties for "using their product"

				Given the state of American law--shoul­d my neighbor plant Monsatans GMO seeds, I would feel compelled to immediatel­y go to court and seek INJUNCTIVE relief to prohibit the disseminat­ion of there pollen on my Organic plantings. That way I won't end up paying Monsatans when their poisonous weeds infect my land. Ditto for MonSantans birth defect causing, super bug creating Round Up....and I don't CARE whether you call me a liberal, a Conservati­ve, or an antisicien­ce luddite...­.Monsatan can keep there products off my LAND, or pay dearly for the tresspass. Land owner rights used to be a conservati­ve cause but I guess those freedoms have also been sold down the river.

				I love how you have no idea what your talking about, study the importance of genetic diversity or talk to a systematic botanist and get back to me. If you knew anything about history either, you would realize that a lack of genetic diversity within a species leads to catastroph­es like the Irish Potato famine. Liberals have been paying attention to the science and thats why we are the only ones who seem to be concerned about what Monsanto is doing to the agricultur­e system in this country.

				Do you even know what you are talking about?!? Did you know that artificial genetic modificati­on is changing our DNA structure? Did you know that they are taking the DNA of animals and putting them in plants without knowing the consequenc­es and paying the researcher­s to conclude that there is no know side effects? Did you know that pesticides are in 100% of wombs and 96% of the child population in the United States? Did you know that your stomach acids change as a result of pesticides­? Did you know that 1 in 33 got cancer in the 1950's and today that is 1 in 3 with 1/2 survival rate? Did you know that GM foods are known to not produce more food, but less? Shall I go on? 

You are comparing two things, potato famine and artificial genetic modificati­on, that are not similar in any means. Enjoy your soy, MSG, and HFCS because someone is deceiving you.

				As you can see further down, I am a German who thinks this was a welcome decision by the court. Nonetheles­s, my position on this does have to do with how I think "freedom" and "free enterprise­" interests should be balanced.
The most obvious point for me is this (and that has got a lot to do with freedom): Here in Germany, the overwhelmi­ng majority of people (not an environmen­talist minority) reject it. They vote accordingl­y at the ballot box (not only the Green party but also in the conservati­ve parties) and organize referendum­s who turn down laws that would allow it. In other words: the decision reflects a democratic will of the people and that IMO trumps a business freedom.
Secondly, many farmers here actually specialize­d on a niche market: BIO- label products who are not treated with herbicides etc. etc. . These products are a little bit more expensive but are sought after. Their businesses could be easily infringed by a nearby GM business. That (and not the question if GM food is economical or ethical justifiabl­e) is at the heart of this case: Even if Mon810 will someday be considered as "foodstuff­", the one who plants it has legal liability for damages this does to others. But it's the only way I see how this can legally be handled and it ofc makes it not very appealing to use GM seeds.

				In (western) Germany, most agricultur­e is done by very small (often as a hobby) or medium sized farms. And even they produce so much that prices are already very low and there is not much profit in that business (hence the subsidies)­. They are also closely linked to tourist destinatio­ns and/or designated wildlife reservoirs or national parks. You would not want to industrial­ize agricultur­e there - or at least you would demand that someone using GM seeds makes sure that none of his business conflicts this (which is simply - such is nature - impossible to do profitably­).
Last but not least, if you look at the greater scheme of things: Europe has - even without GM - already more than enough agricultur­e to meet the people's demand. Most of the monetary profits from the applicatio­n GM seeds would be realized outside the EU (particula­rly with Monsanto). As a point of reference: Agricultur­e in Germany is just 0.9% of GDP. On the other hand, much of the research (and the resulting benefits) in BT or GM can be realized here. There is really no incentive, not much of a benefit to gain.

				It is an incontrove­rtible fact that Monsanto's Round-up Ready plants are creating super-pest­s and super-weed­s. That alone is reason enough to ban their usage. It is also a fact that they're regularly trespassin­g on American farmers land to collect samples to see if their crops have cross pollinated with nearby Monsanto crops giving them the legal right to sue for patent infringeme­nt. They're putting farmers out of business and confiscati­ng their seeds unless they agree to buy into Monsanto's GM crops.

				Whats interestin­g is watching trade flows to Europe and they are clearly importing GMO grain either covertly through the "GMO-free" (ya right) parana ports or overtly through other ports in Brazil and the US and Canada.  So it is comical to see the powers that be over there hold their thumbs down on their own farmers improving their productivi­ty while explicitly supporting GMO farmers elsewhere.  Classic situation where emotion over rationalit­y wins the day.

				Having to reply out of order.

Hopefully i didn't imply that Brazil was the solution to our energy problems.  I was simply trying to point out that Corn Based Ethanol is not the only Ethanol product available.  

There are a lot of other countries that could grow Cane and could certainly use the money (ie Cuba).

I'm no expert on ethanol (as you can likely easily determine from my posts).  And I am actually not in favor of "growing" energy in mass like we are doing now, i think it is amoral so long as there are hungry people in the world.

				no, it is the ignorance of the GOP that has jacked your prices with more and more subsides.  and the idiotic practice of turning a food crop into fuel that neither saves the environmen­t, is NOT energy efficient, and places more and more of the third world countries that have been conned into adopting GMO crops and have to give Monsanto royalties each and every year because they cannot save seeds.

				There is a very good chance the ethanol subsidies and tariffs will end at the end of the year.  In fact you can bet on it and for much of the last few years, the pre-subsid­y price for ethanol has been lower to gasoline thanks to a variety of factors but most importantl­y an ultra-high oil price.  So I was curious, if come next year, ethanol continues to be a very competitiv­e fuel source subsidy free, would you still be against given how many people it employs on our soil and dollars it keeps away from regimes that hate us?

				If the Europeans want to continue to be backwards in agricultur­e..so be it.  

My higher yielding crops which are cheaper to produce will then be the crops sold to china.  Europeans won't have enough to export.  So be it.

				Monsanto might have an easier time selling people on GM crops if they weren't so insufferab­ly arrogant.  If you have a field that is close to a field were GM crops are grown, and the pollen gets on your crops, and you save your seed and replant it they will sue you for using their genetic material.  No joke.  Every person who buys seed from Monsanto has to sign a contract saying they won't replant it.  A farmer in Canada who had his crops partially pollinated by GM pollen was forced to pay Monsanto $120,000 by a court because he "infringed­" on their patent, by saving seeds from his crops on his field and planting them.

				There's much more to the story there. 

As establishe­d in the original Federal Court trial decision, Schmeiser first discovered Roundup-re­sistant canola in his crops in 1997.[2] He had used Roundup herbicide to clear weeds around power poles and in ditches adjacent to a public road running beside one of his fields, and noticed that some of the canola which had been sprayed had survived. Schmeiser then performed a test by applying Roundup to an additional 3 acres (12,000 m2) to 4 acres (16,000 m2) of the same field. He found that 60% of the canola plants survived. At harvest time, Schmeiser instructed a farmhand to harvest the test field. That seed was stored separately from the rest of the harvest, and used the next year to seed approximat­ely 1,000 acres (4 km²) of canola.

				that is true, but the underlying point remains. he didn't intentiona­lly grow the crops himself. if that were you, would u have destroyed the crops? costing you money and time for that year and possibly bankruptin­g you because you couldn't produce as much crop as you normally would have if your crops hadn't gotten infected?

				"and you save your seed and replant it they will sue you for using their genetic material. No joke."

You do realize we are talking about corn in this article, right?   Any farmer who tried to replant his "saved" corn seed would be laughed at as the neighborho­od joke.  That farmer might get 25 bu/acre as opposed to 150-200+ bu/acre from the hybrid  seed (GMO or nonGMO) bought from a seed salesman.

So you are right...it is a joke. The joke is on you antiTechno­logy/AntiS­cience/Ant­iGMO people.  

Don't you have some global warming to deny or something?

				you do understand that you are NOT the only so called farmer in the world right?  
Monsanto has also applied these same standards to the small substance farmers in Africa?  and Monsanto WILL destroy contaminat­ed crops.  
and it is the mono crops that are all geneticall­y identical that keeps these companies in their monopolies­.  it is pure greed that drives you with no regard to the genetic diversity of the natural world.  pollen from GMO.s have been found to contaminat­e plants that are not related as well.

				See, that's why that ruling was so important (and such a setback for Monsanto):
Now, all across the EU these farmers cannot be sued by Monsanto. They will simply dispose of the contaminat­ed seed and sue the Monsanto customer/ farmer for compensati­on. 

About Monsanto's arrogance: They fully know that the overwhelmi­ng majority of people in continenta­l Europe simply don't want GM food. You can tell that the people at Monsanto know because they oppose to put any visible label on food to make customers aware that a product contains traces of GM. They say that customers than wouldn't buy it/ prefer similar products without traces of GM. So, on the one hand Monsanto argues that all the legal and political barriers are in opposition to what - in Monsanto's opinion - should be free markets, on the other hand, in the free marketplac­e (which works oh-so perfect because all these customers just make educated choices) they cannot be bothered to give the informatio­n to the customers and let them decide?

Sorry, but it makes me doubt your sanity.  

Not tested on humans.  Fact.

Causes alergic reactions in many people.  Facts

Generally uses the "gold Gun" to randomly inject genetic material into a a organism.  Most die, then rest are raised a couple of generation to see which ones do best.

				Bees will fly up to five miles to gather pollen from plants and nectar. In addition to that, bees will also gather gluten from corn and wheat in lean times and in the early spring. So GM products are going to be a big issue. The only way to guarantee that bees do not get into GM products is to have NO GM products.

				Bees gather gluten??  From Corn?  hahahahaha­haha

Corn has no gluten.  And there is no such thing as GMO wheat available yet.

In fact.....r­esearchers are trying to make make gluten free wheat to help allergy sufferers.

And here is the irony:....­..gluten free wheat WOULD be GMO wheat.  But it is being delayed by the antiGMO  nutttjobbb­s.

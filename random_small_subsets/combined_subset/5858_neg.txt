After all that fun in the sun, what do you have to show for it? Scorched hair and fading tan lines. While every stylist and esthetician has a treatment for combatting those harsh rays, they're the first to advocate low-fi sun protection -- as in a hat, sunglasses, and shade. 
Vitamins and Minerals 
Sweat and sunscreen clog pores over time. The estheticians at Sally Hershberger's Meatpacking District spa use vitamin C as a powerful anti-oxidant to help even-out the complexion and lighten sun-spots. Their facial treatment also incorporates zinc to calm skin down and relieve sunburn. The cherry on top is galvanic current, which regenerates facial tissue and stimulates collagen production.
The Face Place, 425 West 14th Street, between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, 3rd floor (212-367-8200).

Hair Cocktail
Tell-tale signs of too many rays of sunshine? Split ends, brittle strands and hair that can't hold its styling shape. At Georgia, a Nolita salon and beauty hangout, owner Jodie Patterson eschews topical quick-fixes for treatments that "feed and nourish" hair and skin. Stylists exfoliate and clean the scalp, then tame locks with a cocktail of John Masters organic pomegranate oil and cold-pressed Argan Oil replenishing serum, which they paint onto hair. To take it to the next level, Patterson also recommends holistic treatments on the spot: supplements (like fish oil), protein shake juices and Chinese herbs.
Georgia, 89A East Houston Street, between Elizabeth Street and Bowery (646-827-2428).
Lather 
Woodley & Bunny, the sub-level Williamsburg hair salon and apothecary, can give your damaged and stressed head the full Rahua treatment, a deeply restorative oil from the Amazon rainforest. They also stock Sachajuan products, which use Ocean Silk Technology to lend strength to your locks. The Intensive Repair shampoo and conditioner (new this month) and Overnight Hair Repair can be added on to your styling session. If it's the texture you'll miss, tried-and-true Ocean Mist delivers that authentic fresh-from-the-beach hair style, without the harmful side effects.
Woodley & Bunny, 196 North 10th Street, at Driggs Avenue (718-218-6588). 
Machines and Microchips 
The very futuristic-looking IOMA is a "high tech skin care diagnostic system" that analyzes the skin below the surface. Using aircraft technology, smart phone telecommunications, and algorithms, it can detect skin issues, prescribe a custom regimen (from seven product categories), and measure the effectiveness of the regimen after four weeks of use. IOMA Beauty Pro Line 1 tackles UV damage and dry skin, while Pro Line 3 reduces wrinkles and increases firmness.
Launching at Saks Fifth Avenue on September 8th, 611 Fifth Avenue, between 49th and 50th Streets (212-753-4000).  
The Pill 
You're just about to put away your sunscreen for the season, but do not underestimate the power of that big fiery ball in the sky. Drop into the sun section online or in person at Chelsea's New London Pharmacy, which takes a modern and holistic approach to the neighborhood drug store concept. You'll find natural skin tanners and little orange bottles of Heliocare Sun Protection capsules, which have an extract of a tropical fern that's rich in antioxidants. Not a magic bullet for over exposure to the sun, exactly, but a first line of defense for the months to come.
New London Pharmacy, 246 Eighth Avenue, between 22nd and 23rd Streets (212-243-4987).

On Saturday, September 17,  the Humane Society of Williamson County will sponsor the Furr-Ever Friends Fall Fest with the goal of finding homes for 100 abandoned dogs and cats.
There will be lots of fun and games for the whole family, food and drink vendors, and Ask-a-Vet and Ask-a-Trainer stations to answer all your pet-related questions. Kids will love the Kiddie Station with its free bounce house.
Adoption fees will be drastically discounted during the event. Excitement will build each hour as personnel from HSWC will spin the big pricing wheel to set adoption fees which will range from Free to $25.
“The last event of this size that HSWC hosted was in August and was wildly successful as we found 102 forever homes for our sheltered dogs and cats! We know that there are many, many families and individuals throughout our great community looking to bring a new pet into their home,” said Eran Fehily, HSWC Community Relations Manager.
When: Saturday, September 17, 2011; 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Where: Williamson County Humane Society, 10930 East Crystal Falls Parkway, Leander, Texas

At BlogPaws and BlogHer, one of the recommendations for better knowing reader interests was to conduct a survey; ever since then, we’ve been hard at work on the survey you see below.  We’d love it if you could take a couple of minutes and answer the survey; it’s completely anonymous and all the questions are optional so just skip any that don’t apply or that you don’t want to answer. Many thanks for your help in giving us a better picture of our readers!
(Note: if you are reading this in our newsletter, please click the title of the post to visit the survey directly!)

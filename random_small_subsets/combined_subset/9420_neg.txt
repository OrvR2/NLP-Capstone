Politically, It’s D.O.A. But Is Obama’s Jobs Plan a Good One?By Peter GorensteinPostsWebsiteBy Peter Gorenstein | Daily Ticker – 12 hours ago


President Obama is scheduled Thursday to unveil his plan to put Americans back to work. According to early reports, the plan follows a similar script the President used in 2009: government stimulus.
Specifically, the plan calls for $300 billion in government spending through tax cuts, infrastructure spending and aid to state and local governments.
"Almost half the stimulus would come from tax cuts, which include an extension of a two percentage-point reduction in the payroll tax paid by workers due to expire Dec. 31 and a new decrease in the portion of the tax paid by employers," Al Hunt of Bloomberg reports.
The GOP may back the tax cuts but is likely to reject the overall plan on its face, calling it a repeat of failed measures.
Setting aside the GOP reaction ("We hate it!") and the likelihood of it passing ("Not over my dead body"), in the accompanying clip, The Daily Ticker's Henry Blodget asks Yahoo! Finance economics editor Daniel Gross if, in fact, the plan is a good one?
Tax cuts: The payroll tax cuts are a positive for business as it benefits both business owners and employees. In other words, it's a "tax cut to people who need it," Gross says.  "It's a regressive tax because it only is taxed on your first $106,00 of income," he says. "Presumably (those who benefit) will take that money and spend it, boosting demand for the good."  Unfortunately, Gross thinks the GOP will reject the idea even though it is a tax cut.  He speculates the GOP will agree to it only if Obama makes a concession on entitlement programs, something the Democratic base will not appreciate.

Infrastructure: Of course this is a good idea, according to Gross. "Our roads are terrible, traffic is bad, construction workers are idle." What better way to remedy the situation than to build and repair roads and bridges? Not only does it improve the standard of living, infrastructure improvements also create jobs and improves business conditions. Plus, if there were ever a time to take advantage of cheap borrowing costs, it's now, says Gross. Bottom line: If the U.S. wants to remain competitive against China and other emerging markets in Asia, the country needs better infrastructure.

Direct aid to states and local governments:  While the private sector is adding jobs, albeit at a slow pace, government is cutting jobs. Since the end of the recession, government workers (federal, state and local) have lost roughly 600,000 jobs. State and local governments have been hit especially hard, with 200,000 fewer jobs in 2010 versus 2009. Obama's plan would focus on halting layoffs of teachers and first responders. That's something Gross can get behind. "I'm all for things that will keep people in their current jobs."

Stopping of importing goods does not bring back American jobs. Especially when America isn't equipped to handle the production of those goods. That's a nice thought, but if companies wanted to open shop in the U.S. and produce those items for the premium they would cost they would never have gone to China to get them in the first place. Good luck convincing a textile company to finance a textmile mill in the U.S. to produce tshirts that cost $8.00. It's not feasible.

KEEP PRINTING MONEY OBAMA, and extending unemployment.  If you can't find a job in 26 weeks, why be paid to sit on your butt for 99 weeks????  Obama added 3.7 trillion dollars to the deficit sine he took office, what will 16 more months for us bring?  Tomorrow he will announce in his speech that his PRIVATE (exactly like a corporate) jet will be renamed "Air Force One TERM".

Correct me, if these statistics are factually wrong: 
1) Liberals tend to have higher IQs that conservatives.
2) Liberals trend toward having higher levels of education and have read more books than conservatives.
3) Liberals tend to have traveled to more foreign countries more than conservatives have.
4) Liberals have healthier eating habits, and exercise more than the typical conservative.
5) Liberals are less superstitious than conservatives.
6) Liberals are statistically less racist than conservatives.
7) There is less domestic violence in liberal homes than in conservative ones.
8) There are more bilingual and trilingual liberals than conservatives.
9)  Liberals are more likely to know hard facts about history and current events that conservatives.
10) Liberals are less likely to be religious (any religion), and tend to be more agnostic.
11) Liberals are more likely to champion rights for women, children, minorities, and homosexuals than conservatives.
12) Liberals prefer the government to spend tax revenue on more on education and health care, while conservatives tend to support subsidies for corporations and large military budgets.
13) Liberals are far less likely to take the Bible literally than conservatives.

The statistics aren't wrong.  This is what the studies say.  1+1=2, and that's just the way is.  If you can count, you can't deny this.

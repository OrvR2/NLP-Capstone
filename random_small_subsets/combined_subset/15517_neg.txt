Beatles radio show host Chris Carter hits 10-year mark on Sept. 4




 
Maria Elena Holly is joining Carter in conjunction with activities next week surrounding what would have been her husband’s 75th birthday on Sept. 7. In the 1970s, McCartney bought the rights to Holly’s publishing catalog because all four band members were huge fans of the Texas singer, songwriter and guitarist’s music, and the Beatles even modeled their name on that of Holly’s group, the Crickets.

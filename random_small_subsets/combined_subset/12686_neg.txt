Weekend beercast: Pedal power to the people

You can party on wheels this Saturday when the folks at Pedal Party “christen” their newest bicycle-gear-powered, movable bar.
And even if you don’t think you have the energy — or inclination — to pump the pedals to tipple in the afternoon heat, there still will be beer, games such as cornhole and food trucks on hand at the “World HQ,” 2000 Edwards. Promoters also promise “door prizes including a $50 gift card to Sawyer Park Sports Bar, a $50 Gift Card to Liberty Station and a Gift Card for a FREE Pedal Party.”
As for the bike itself (photo at left), you may have seen this 16-seat contraption cruising up and down Washington Avenue and parts of the lower Heights, overflowing with a convivial and youngish crowd being served beer poured from a keg inside a wooden barrel at the front. It’s available for rental by the hour for groups of 8 to 16 at Pedal-Party.com.
And with the addition of a second Pedal Party bike, you can now book a group of up to 32. The company suggests they’d be good for “bar crawls, corporate team building events, progressive dinners, birthday celebrations, family reunions, wedding/engagement parties or any other group function.”
That sounds about right, although I’d recommend you make sure you don’t have any slackers in your group. I took a spin a little more than a year ago, on a sweltering White Linen Night, and found the novelty wore off quickly as we labored to keep it moving forward. To be fair, there were some empty seats and a couple of free-riders on board. (You know who you are.)
Seriously, don’t let that discourage you; it does look fun and the glasses of cold Saint Arnold we slugged made the effort that muggy August night seem worth it.

		@secka_shee The big fire here is Bear Creek (Cass County) and neighboring Peter’s Chapel and #538 in Harrison County. Shreveport, LA, in the foreground. Bastrop is out of scene.

		So much smoke is rising into the Earth's atmosphere.  Must be very dry where the fire is and the wind is pushing it along.

		@SophalMiracle A tropical storm over that land would have fueled the fires even more. Widespread disasters then ….

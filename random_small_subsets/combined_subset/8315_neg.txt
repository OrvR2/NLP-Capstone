Mexico finds tunnel dug into drains on US borderAP – Mon, Sep 5, 2011





MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican federal police say they have found a tunnel dug into a border storm drain that leads into the United States.Federal police say the tunnel was presumably used to smuggle people into the United States.It appears smugglers dug a lateral tunnel into a main drain. An exit on the U.S. side was hidden by a cover piled over with dirt.The tunnel may have also been used to move illicit goods, but the police statement did not specify what goods.Police said Sunday the tunnel was found Thursday in the Mexican border city of Nogales, across the border from Nogales, Arizona. Police found it acting on information they received after discovering another tunnel in Nogales on Aug. 16.

Scipio....When the Europeans came to the America's there were no illegal laws and borders, every country now has them, do you feel we should eleminate them as far as Mexicans go? 
I am serious about wanting to know how you feel about this issue.

La Raza etc.., say that the southwest was their homeland. Mexicans are descended from the native tribes of mexico and European colonist. Theynever lived in the southwest. Ask any Yaqui, Commanche, Hopi, Navaho, Papago, and Apache native American. Ask Any one of these Tribes if their mexican...than look out. The last known Apache raid was in mexico in 1939. Cochise, Mancos, Geronimo etc.., hated the mexicans just as much as any leaders of the other tribes. Why? Because mexicans murdered, and tried to enslave them. Just like the genocide still ongoing in mexico against their Native Indian population.

America hate Mexicanos but allow lazy blks to rob, steal, and terrorize.   Turn on your evening news to see what group is hurting America more.  It's not us; it's the very people you carry on your backs with welfare and food stamps.

I forgot to mention that the bridge between Mexico and Brownsville, Texas is open and the people walk across the bridge to work in the USA. They are supposed to return to Mexico after their work day ends. Children, too are allowed to cross the bridge to attend school in the USA. Some go home and some do not. It then becomes an "oh well," type of thing for immigration officials because they are limited in what they are allowed to do.

If Mexicans would just spend half the time and energy working on their country as they do sneaking into ours they would have a country they wouldn't want to run away from in the first place.

Bottom line: If mexico is so great, and so viva mexico, then why are they all here mooching from the gringo's and the U.S. tax-payers.
What a screwed up, fourth world bunch of hypocrites.

I dislike Hyphenated Americans that are born in or even immigrate to this country legally. Illegals should be deported as soon as they are found. The argument that illegals do the job that Americans don't want is asinine. Law abiding is laughable if you are here illegally. You cut in line in while other who are trying to do the right thing have to go through the proper channels. You use the emergency rooms as your primary doctor. You are a drain on the whole system. Worst yet some of you are so irresponsible that you bring your kids with you and make them suffer the same suffering that all illegals have to suffer through. Half of illegals don't even to make an attempt to learn English. Besides we have entire prison population to pick fruits for 12 cents a day. They are typical illegals, you have become convinced that America needs you, which we don't, and that all the problems in Mexico is because of Americans appetite for drugs. Who's ready for another American/mexican war? We all know how that went. Except when we push them back to Mexico city, again, we just keep that land as payback to the American tax payer."

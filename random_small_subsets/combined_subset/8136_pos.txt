One Man’s 175 Classic Car Collection Destroyed By Texas Wildfire


Posted: Thu, 08 Sep 2011 12:41:24 +0000

Well, this just sucks!
A Shelby Cobra, ’47 Studebaker pickup, ’66 Pontiac GTO, several mid-’50s Chevrolets as well as a dozen Corvettes have been destroyed by the wildfires sweeping across Texas, and all were owned by one man. John Chapman, 70, had his entire 175 classic car collection reduced to ashes.
Despite the loss, John says his house and family are safe and continues on to say you can either laugh or cry. He’s chosen to laugh.
I’d be crying.

Jaguar Unveils C-X16 Concept, Brings Small & Sexy Back (Video)


Posted: Wed, 07 Sep 2011 15:55:45 +0000
Jaguar C-X16 Concept
Jaguar has opened the floodgates on their long-teased and gorgeous new C-X16 concept. And it is a looker! Unlike the C-X75 and aimed for the world’s elite, the C-X16 has been designed to take dead aim at Porsche’s venerable 911.
It is a hybrid, but have no fear. This baby Jag (which is in fact shorter than the new 911) boasts some impressive performance figures. The new coupe tops out at 186 mph with a 0-62 mph time of 4.4 seconds. Most impressive, however, is the C-X16′s ability to go from 50-75 mph in just 2.1 seconds! Despite these numbers, it can also scoot around town on electric power alone with speeds up to 50 mph. 

Making all this possible is a supercharged 3-liter V6 producing 375 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque as well as an electric generator mated to an 8-speed gearbox. When not scooting casually through town, the C-X16′s hybrid drive (powered by brake regeneration) comes into play with a steering wheel mounted ‘Push to Pass’ function. This adds an extra 94 horsepower and boosts the torque figure by an extra 173, a modern day equivalent of a go-baby-go nitrous boost I guess.
Jaguar C-X16 Concept
The C-X16 is damn sexy, especially from the rear 3/4 view. I particular love the high visibility and upward angle of the rear exhaust. This exhaust design as well as the side-rotating rear hatch are not just beautifully but  pay tribute to the company’s iconic E-Type.
My only hesitation is that the C-X16 in its current form borders on a bit too over-the-top coming off a bit tuner-ish. That said, however, this is a ‘concept’ and any production version of its base model will no doubt have a less muscular stance while the design we see here will no doubt resurface with the inevitable (and highly anticipated) V8 models.

Press Release
C-X16 PRODUCTION CONCEPT REDEFINES JAGUAR SPORTS CARS

C-X16 is a bold statement of Jaguar’s future design and technological intent
A compact, rear-wheel drive, two-seater, with a true sporting character, underpinned by immensely strong aluminium architecture – perfect 50:50 weight distribution
Powered by an innovative supercharged 3.0-litre V6 producing 380 PS (280 kW) and 332 lb ft (450 Nm) of torque
Hybrid system controlled by a steering-wheel mounted ‘Push to Pass’ button boosts output by 70 kW and 235 Nm
Top speed of 186 mph, 0-62 mph in 4.4 seconds and 50-75 mph acceleration in 2.1 seconds with CO2 emissions of 165 g/km

Jaguar has released details of the C-X16 concept ahead of its world debut at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show.
Looking firmly to the future, the C-X16 marks a new chapter for Jaguar.  The two-seater concept has inspired new advances in design, in engineering and in vehicle technology to create the most compact and responsive Jaguar in a generation.  A hybrid, the C-X16 combines searing performance with beautifully realised styling.
Adrian Hallmark, Global Brand Director, Jaguar Cars:”The C-X16 embodies the established Jaguar strengths of sensual design, animal-like agility and inspirational performance and combines these with attributes that set us on a course to create sustainable sports cars of the future.”
Ian Callum, Director of Design, Jaguar Cars:”Jaguars have always been dramatically different. With the C-X16 we have moved the current award-winning design language on to the next generation, creating a car that is the very essence of future Jaguar performance.”
Under the muscular clamshell bonnet is a next-generation supercharged V6 petrol engine producing 380 PS (280kW) and 332 lb ft (450 Nm) of torque. Already boasting a high specific power output of 126 PS-per-litre, the performance of the C-X16 is further supplemented by a Formula 1-inspired hybrid boost system with a steering-wheel mounted button for on-demand acceleration.
Integrated into the eight-speed gearbox is a motor generator which draws power from a 1.6kWh battery pack mounted behind the seats for ideal 50:50 weight distribution. Charged through a brake energy regeneration system, the batteries allow the motor to provide an additional 95 PS (70 kW) and173 lb ft (235 Nm).
Mounted in an aluminium chassis structure, the result is 0-62 mph acceleration in 4.4 seconds, a top speed of 186 mph and acceleration from 50-75 mph of 2.1 seconds. The C-X16 is also able to travel at speeds of up to 50 mph under electric power alone and has CO2 emissions of 165 g/km.
The C-X16 measures 4,445 mm in length, 2,048 mm in width and 1,297 mm in height and has a wheelbase measuring 2,622 mm.  In terms of overall length, the C-X16 is the smallest Jaguar created since 1954 and the XK120.
The C-X16 will be presented at the Jaguar Land Rover press conference in Hall Five at the Frankfurt Motor Show on Tuesday September 13 at 09:15 CET.
 




Porsche Boss Confirms Upcoming Addition Of Ferrari-Fighter To Lineup


Posted: Wed, 31 Aug 2011 20:00:45 +0000



Sure, Ferrari has had the thorn of Lamborghini in its side since the late ’60s, but with the powerhouse that is Porsche, it is a bit mind boggling the only real competition the German automaker has ever put up against the Prancing Horse was back with the Carrera GT and way back with the 959.
While hinted at before, Porsche boss Matthais Mueller has now confirmed the company will be adding a new model into the mix slotting in between the 911 GT2 and forthcoming 918 Spyder to give Ferrari a run for its money. MSRP for the Ferrari-fighter is expected to range from roughly $360,000 to $580,00.
This is definitely good news. My only hesitation from getting too excited, however, comes with the thought of which model in Ferrari’s lineup are they intending to go after? With all the rumors and scuttlebutt of Porsche developing a next-generation 928 with a front-engined GT tourer, the company’s new model could simply be this vehicle with official word we are to take it as competition to Ferrari’s 599.
This better not be the case. When I think Ferrari-fighter, I think mid-engined, 2 seats (no 2+2), and ready for a track day. And while I’m very much looking forward to Porsche’s GT tourer, I’m just hoping its something else entirely to which Mr. Mueller is eluding.

Unconscionable! Ferrari Enzo Abandoned In Dubai!


Posted: Wed, 31 Aug 2011 19:53:42 +0000


Ferrari Enzo abandoned in Dubai
As you well know, this is a Ferrari Enzo. One of only 399 built for the public and it’s rotting beneath Dubai’s desert sun.
While this wouldn’t be the first time the area’s rich treat one of the world’s rarest and most treasured vehicles with utter disregard, word is that most of these examples are now occurring not just out of laziness, but after owners have fled the country due to failed business ventures.
The good news is that this particular exotic was spotted in a police impound lot and can therefore be saved when it’s put up for auction.
Nobody knows the damage done from its bake in the 115 degree heat, but with a pristine Enzo selling around $1.5 million, we’re sure someone will snag this horse.

It’s Official: All-New Porsche 911 – My, What Big Wheels You Have


Posted: Sun, 28 Aug 2011 16:50:46 +0000


2012 Porsche 911 Carrera S
So, it’s that time again. Porsche has unveiled the all-new 911 and is sending it to Frankfurt for its first appearance in a couple weeks. Codenamed the 991, the new model is 3.9″ longer, sits a bit wider, and has dropped 100 pounds. Both the base Carrera and the Carrera S produce more horsepower (350 and 400) yet consume less fuel than their outgoing counterparts. The interior has also been shifted to be more in line with that of the Panamera.
With 48 years of what occurs like the most minimal design evolution possible, Porsche has long been the brunt of jokes focusing from laziness to boredom in a market surrounded by GT-Rs, Aston V8 Vantages, and Lotus’ Evora. I’ve long shared this point of view. Even Porsche themselves mention ‘evolution, not revolution’, yet if you’re like me you may see a bit more than usual in this newest generation.
Catching my attention are new exhaust outlets, a wider spoiler and sleeker taillights, but an actual surprise is the abundance of badging across the rear. Where before we’d simply see which variant in 911 range the vehicle represented, ’911′ is now added in front of the variant branding and sits just below the full ‘PORSCHE’ badge seen on the rest of the company’s lineup. Is the company no longer secure the entire world knows these are 911s? or Porsches for that matter?
2012 Porsche 911 Carrera 
Despite some noticeable changes, I have to ask – Do we care? Does it matter? It’s always occurred to me that if you’re in the market for a 911, you will simply scoot down to the dealer, attempt to discern which of the 23 variants (!) match your lifestyle, and grab the latest model. I can’t imagine any buyer standing in the showroom contemplating what’s been slightly altered from the model they saw cruising by years ago. Hell, even those seeking a pre-owned model from before any so-called facelifts or previous generations will barely give it two thoughts.
Don’t let me fool you though, I love the 911. It’s quintessentially German, expertly engineered, I love driving them, and it’s everything I want in a sports car (performance-wise anyway). I just can’t get excited for a 911.

Press Release
Porsche to Unveil All-New 2012 Porsche 911 Carrera
World Premiere at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show Next Month
ATLANTA — August 23 2011 – At 48, the Porsche 911 Carrera is younger  than ever. The completely redesigned seventh-generation sports car icon  is stepping into the limelight with its sleek and stretched silhouette,  exciting contours and precisely designed features. Yet from every angle  it is unmistakably a 911, holding true to the Porsche 911 Carrera  ‘evolution, not revolution’ design philosophy.
The 100 mm or 3.9 inch longer wheelbase and reduced overall height  underpin the fresh, athletic yet elegant appearance. When viewed from  the front, the eye is drawn to the 911′s trademark wide-arched fenders,  emphasizing the wider front track. The side mirrors are now mounted on  the upper edge of the door, which also helps highlight the new design  line and gives the visual impression of width.
The new lightweight body is an aluminum-steel composite construction  and contributes greatly to the 45 kg or about 100 lbs weight reduction  when compared to the previous 911 body. When combined with the greater  structural rigidity and optimized aerodynamics – including a wider,  variably extending rear spoiler – the new 911 Carrera’s front and rear  lift has been reduced to near zero while retaining the Cd value of 0.29.
To complement the modern exterior design, Porsche designers created an  interior reminiscent of the Carrera GT. The driver is now even more  closely integrated within the cockpit thanks to the rising center  console and high-mounted shift lever or gear selector located close to  the steering wheel. As with the exterior, classic Porsche elements  abound inside. Present is the instrument cluster with five round gauges –  one of them a high resolution multifunction screen, and of course the  central tachometer and the ignition lock to the left of the steering  wheel.
Setting the standard in its class, as it has for generations, the new  911 Carrera and 911 Carrera S raise the performance and efficiency bar  yet another notch. All versions get by with significantly less than 10  liters of fuel per 100 kilometers (official U.S. EPA fuel mileage  estimates are TBD) and fuel consumption and emissions are up to 16  percent lower in the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) when compared  with the predecessor. This is achieved through systems such as the  Automatic Start Stop function, engine and transmission thermal  management, electrical system recuperation, the world’s first  seven-speed manual transmission and – in conjunction with the Porsche  Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (PDK) – the ability to ‘sail’ or coast. The new  electro-mechanical power steering offers not only Porsche’s typical  precision and feedback but also helps increase efficiency and reduce  fuel-consumption.
For example, the 911 Carrera with the new 350 hp, 3.4-liter boxer  engine and optional PDK consumes 8.2 l/100 km based on the NEDC – 1.6  l/100 km less than its predecessor.
The 911 Carrera S with its 400 hp, 3.8-liter boxer engine – 15 hp more  than before – achieves 8.7 l/100 km in the NEDC when paired with the  optional PDK transmission. This represents a fuel consumption decrease  of 14 percent or 1.5 l/100 km.
At the same time there are performance improvements in both models.  The 911 Carrera S with PDK accelerates from 0 to 60 in 4.1 seconds.  Using the Launch Control function of the optional Sport Chrono Package  cuts that to 3.9 seconds. The 911 Carrera with PDK needs only 4.4  seconds to sprint from a standing start to 60 mph (4.2 seconds when  using the optional Sport Chrono Package’s Launch Control function).  Top-track speed for the 911 Carrera S and 911 Carrera is 188 mph and 179  mph, respectively.
The new 911 offers both better longitudinal dynamics and unprecedented  top performance in terms of transverse dynamics. In addition to the  longer wheelbase, the greater agility, precision and driving stability  are based, among other things, on the wider front track, the new rear  axle and new electro-mechanical power steering. Depending on the model,  there are other standard or optional active control systems available  that can help further enhance the overall driving dynamics. That is  especially true for the Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) active  roll stabilization system, available for the first time on the 911  Carrera S. The system helps reduce lateral roll when cornering and helps  keep the tires in the optimal position relative to the road surface.
The new 911 further extends the span of seemingly contradictory  attributes such as performance and efficiency, sportiness and every day  practicality that have always typified the Porsche 911. That makes the  911 Carrera more of a 911 than ever. The new Porsche 911 Carrera  celebrates its world premiere at the 2011 IAA Frankfurt Motor Show in  September.
The first new 911 models will arrive in U.S. dealerships beginning in  February of 2012. The new 911 Carrera Coupe will have a base MSRP of  $82,100, while the 911 Carrera S Coupe’s base MSRP will be $96,400  (excluding destination). Both models will include substantial additional  equipment when compared to the previous models.




It’s Official: Ferrari Debuts 458 Spider With Video


Posted: Wed, 24 Aug 2011 16:48:12 +0000


Ferrari 458 Spider
And yes, it is gorgeous! Ferrari has dropped the top a bit early on the new 458 Spider before its official debut at this year’s Frankfurt Motor Show next month. Though most in the industry were convinced the new berlinetta would indeed feature a folding hardtop of some sorts, immense speculation surrounded exactly how the company would achieve such an engineering feat given the car’s tapering rear design.
Ferrari 458 Spider
The ingenious result is a mechanism closer to the flip-style lid of the older 575 Super America rather than the ‘standard’ style found on the California. After flipping back, the roof is concealed below the rear deck lid in just 14 seconds. This means, however, that to have the wind in your hair it’ll cost you, and others, the ability to see the car’s incredible 4.5-liter V8 that’s visible so prominently in the 458 Coupe.
No doubt that the new 458 Spider will go down as one of the most gorgeous roadsters of all time. It certainly has our votes.

Press Release
THE NEW FERRARI 458 SPIDER
 The world’s first mid-rear engined berlinetta equipped with a retractable hard top debuts at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Maranello, 23rd August 2011 – The new 458 Spider joins the 458 Italia,  widening the range of Ferrari’s mid-rear engined V8s and offering the  same uncompromising technological solutions, handling and performance in  a refined open-top configuration. It is equipped with a Ferrari  patented, fully retractable hard top, a world first for a sports car  with this lay-out.
The 458 Spider is powered by Ferrari’s naturally-aspirated,  direct-injection 4.5 litre V8 which was nominated as the 2011  International Engine of the Year for its engineering excellence in terms  of driveability, performance, economy and refinement. The power is  transferred to the road by Ferrari’s class-leading dual-clutch F1  paddle-shift transmission through the sophisticated E-Diff, itself  integrated with the F1-Trac traction control and high-performance ABS  for maximum handling dynamics.
Certain features, such as its accelerator pedal mapping and the  damping of the multilink suspension, have been calibrated to guarantee  maximum sportiness and absolute driving pleasure with the top down, in  line with Maranello’s exclusive spider tradition. Even the engine  soundtrack has been honed to ensure that the car’s occupants are  completely captivated by the drop-top driving experience.
Entirely in aluminium, the hard-top solution adopted for the 458  Spider offers a number of advantages over the traditional folding  soft-top, including a reduction of 25 kg in weight and a deployment time  of just 14 seconds. Fully integrated into the styling of the car, the  hard-top was engineered to fit neatly ahead of the engine bay without  compromising aerodynamics or the performance of the car. The small space  needed to house the roof enables the designers to include a generous  rear bench for luggage behind the seats.
The rear of the car is characterised by innovative forms with the  buttresses designed to optimise the flow of air to the engine intakes  and the clutch and gearbox oil radiators. For maximum comfort whilst  driving top down the 458 Spider features a generously-sized adjustable  electric wind stop. The design was perfected to slow and diffuse the air  in the cockpit, enabling normal conversation to be held even at speeds  over 200 km/h.
New technical solutions adopted for the chassis guarantee identical  levels of structural rigidity with the roof up or down. The result is a  car that is truly exciting to drive, blending extreme performance with  the responsiveness that has always characterised Ferrari’s open-top  berlinettas.

1934 Voisin C-25 Aerodyne Takes ‘Best Of Show’ At 61st Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance


Posted: Tue, 23 Aug 2011 16:23:49 +0000


1934 Voisin C-25 Aerodyne 'Best Of Show' Winner
Peter Mullin and his wife’s 1934 Voisin C-25 Aerodyne has snagged the ‘Best of Show’ award at this year’s Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance. The Voisin beat out of a field of 227 vehicles during the 61st outing of the prestigious event.
A mere 28 examples of the C-25 chassis were created between 1934 and 1937 and only 8 received the Aerodyne body. Its ‘fixed roof’ slides back over the trunk creating the sunroof opening and one of the earliest and sleekest ‘targa’ models we’ve ever known. It is powered by a 3-liter sleeve-valve type motor with two carburetors producing 100 horsepower with a top speed of 85 mph.
Peter Mullin is an avid connoisseur of French automobiles and is of course the man behind the must-see Mullin Automotive Museum in Oxnard we visited last year (where two other extremely rare Voisons are on display). This is his first ‘Best of Show’ win in his 27 years of displaying vehicles at Pebble Beach.

1934 Voisin C-25 Aerodyne 'Best Of Show' Winner

61st Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance Names 1934 Voisin Best of Show
More than 225 Collector Cars and Motorcycles from 14 Countries are  Showcased During Competition Along California’s Monterey Coast
PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (Aug. 21, 2011) – A 1934 Voisin C-25  Aerodyne owned by Peter and Merle Mullin from Los Angeles was named Best  of Show at the 61st Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance held Sunday on the  18th fairway of Pebble Beach Golf Links. Additionally, proceeds from  raffles, auctions, sponsorships and ticket sales helped contribute more  than $1 million to charity for the sixth straight year.
Competitors  from 30 states, the District of Columbia, 14 countries and the  principality of Monaco brought their prized automotive possessions to  California’s Monterey Peninsula for judging in 29 classes. In the end,  the French-made Voisin was judged the best, a particularly gratifying  achievement for Peter Mullin, a self-described “French car guy.”
“Winning  with the Voisin is the most special, significant, rewarding thing  that’s ever happened to me…outside of marrying my wife (and the Voisin’s  co-owner Merle),” said Mullin, a 69-year-old financial services  entrepreneur and philanthropist. “There’s nothing like the Voisin  interior. You can’t print the fabric in this car; you have to loom it.   This interior is going to last a long time.”
This is the first Pebble Beach Concours Best of Show win for Mullin in 27 appearances at the annual classic car event.
“I’ve  been showing at Pebble Beach for nearly three decades and this is the  greatest venue in the world,” he said.  “It’s the ultimate thrill,  although I wasn’t sure I’d actually won.  “We were sitting in the  bullpen with the other two finalists (out of a field of 227 cars), the  judges pointed at me and I thought I finished third… and then the  fireworks went off.”
The other cars nominated for Best of Show  were a 1938 Talbot-Lago T150-C owned by Richard Stephens from Auburn,  Calif., and a 1929 Bentley Speed Six owned by Daniel Sielecki from  Capital, Argentina.
“The Voisin is a four-door closed car, so  it’s actually an unexpected winner,” said Concours Chairman Sandra  Button.  “However, the car’s remarkable attention to detail brought it  forward during judging and it became a real crowd pleaser.”
“The  Voisin automobiles are always influenced by the fact that Gabriel Voisin  came from the world of aviation. There was so much craftsmanship in  everything he put together.  For Voisin, form follows function, and this  car features an amazing, interesting upholstery and interior.”
Voisin,  who built airplanes during World War I and converted his focus to  automobiles once peace was declared, sold more than 11,000 of his  usually unconventional, rather expensive vehicles between 1919 and 1939.   The distinctive C-25 Voisin, featuring a blend of French curves,  highlights Voisin’s aeronautic expertise, such as the use of lightweight  materials and streamlined designs.
The 2011 Pebble Beach  Concours show field included a celebration of Mercedes-Benz and 125  years of the automobile, with nearly 40 Benz, Mercedes and Mercedes-Benz  vehicles participating, including the oldest car on the field – an 1894  Benz Victoria Vis à Vis.  The Stutz centennial was also highlighted,  with 27 vehicles shown.  And the 50th anniversary of the Ferrari 250 GTO  was featured in a special class, with 21 of the 36 sports cars ever  built on display. Other special classes included Rolls-Royce Edwardian  Silver Ghosts and Italian motorcycles.
Tonight Show host Jay  Leno made a guest appearance during the awards ceremony, and other  celebrities in attendance included top-selling recording artist Sheryl  Crow and Academy Award-winning actress Mira Sorvino.  Actor Edward  Herrmann served as the event’s master of ceremonies for the 13th  consecutive year.
The Pebble Beach Concours has benefited  many charities throughout its long history.  Current primary charity  partners include Pebble Beach Company Foundation, United Way Monterey  Country and Boys & Girls Clubs of Monterey County. The 2011 Pebble  Beach Concours d’Elegance raised $1,154,778 for these organizations.  Over time it has now generated more than $15 million for local, national  and international charitable groups.
The Pebble Beach Concours  occurs every year on the third Sunday in August. Featured marques for  the 62nd Pebble Beach Concours, slated for Sunday, Aug. 19, 2012, will  include Cars of the Maharajas as well as Mercer and German motorcycles.  Other features will be announced in coming months.

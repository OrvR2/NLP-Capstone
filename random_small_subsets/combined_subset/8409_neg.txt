2 Pakistan Airlines flights get bomb threatsBy ASHRAF KHAN - Associated Press | AP – 15 hrs ago

KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — Two flights operated by Pakistan's state-owned airline received bombs threats on Wednesday, and both landed safely, one in Turkey, the other in Malaysia, officials said. No bombs were found.The first flight was headed for Manchester, England, when it was notified of the threat near the Bulgarian capital of Sofia. The crew contacted the control tower in Istanbul to seek permission for the landing, state-run Anatolia news agency reported.Authorities quickly evacuated all 378 passengers from the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft after it parked at a remote corner of the International Ataturk Airport, and bomb squads began searching the plane with sniffer dogs, Anatolia reported.PIA spokesman Mashood Tajwar confirmed the flight received a threat and landed. All passengers were safe. A police search turned up no bomb, officials said.Later, a second PIA flight from Islamabad to Kuala Lumpur also received a bomb threat. It landed in Kuala Lumpur and all the passengers disembarked safely, said Tajwar.Malaysia's airports authority said the passengers were being screened and the plane was isolated in a parking area while being searched by police. No bomb was found.It said the plane carried 164 passengers and 13 crew. Azmi Murad, senior general manager for the authority, said the Pakistani airline informed it that the warning came by email.Tajwar gave no details on the nature of the threat or how it was delivered.Pakistan is home to al-Qaida's top leadership. Militants who trained there have been responsible for many of the attacks and failed plots in the United States and Europe since Sept. 11, 2001, when planes hijacked by al-Qaida militants destroyed the World Trade Center in New York and crashed into the Pentagon.The bomb threats came four days before the 10th anniversary of 9/11, but there was no apparent link to Islamist militants, who typically do not alert authorities in advance.The FBI and Homeland Security department issued warnings last weekend about al-Qaida threats to small airlines.___Associated Press writer Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur and Selcan Hacaoglu in Istanbul contributed to this report.

who cares? Maybe they need a taste of their own medicine. That country wouldn't exist today if it were not for US Aid, as well as the initial cash flow and infrastructure provided by India.

I earlier mentioned the lack of good common sense in the Middle East.  Here is a true story that involved myself while working for NATO in Izmir, Turkey.    At a stop light I pulled up behind the car stopped in front of me.  There was about a 7-10 ft distance between that car and myself.  I heard the tires screech from behind and braced for a rear end collision which did happen.  The force was so strong that it pushed my car forward into the car in front, and of course the car behind sandwiched my car.  No injury, but my car looked like a sardine can.  When the Turkish police arrived they determined I was 100% at fault.  Reason given was, if I would not have been in Turkey, my car would not have been in Turkey, therefore it would have left a gap between who I hit, and who hit me..... conclusion that gap would have given the driver of the car who hit me plenty of room to stop....and there would have been no accident should I not have been there.     OK, there  you have an excellent example of how common sense does not always apply in the Middle East.....   It simply does not exist....

If we could only round up all the muslims on the face of the Earth and send them to another planet.  How wonderful would that be??

The Middle East will never make sense to the Common Sense people of the world.  We Americans work, play, and live mostly in a world that makes perfect sense (except for our politicians), but the Middle East understands feuds, bombs, arms and missiles as their way of life.   They would all like to be like the western and industrialized nations, but have no clue how  to get there.  Consequently they cause trouble and havoc in hopes we will take notice of how important they are.    I speak from having experience working inside NATO and dealing with this loss of their common sense.   I figure in about 100 years they will be where we are today and enjoy peace for the sake of peace.    Until then.... SIGH!!!!!

Splendor is in the Memories
====================
The wonderful yesterday, when Pan-Am Jumbo broke apart over Scotland is fading away like a blushed twilight.
Though nothing can bring back those sweet moments of white Pigs falling from the sky onto Lockerbie.
I will grieve not but rather find splendor in the memories.

More Pakistan Airlines should get bomb threats. That way, no one will fly on Pakistan Airlines, and they will have to declare bankruptcy.

Pakistan is paying the price for playing games to both the West, mainly the US and the Taliban/al-Qaida. The Pakistani govt sold US secrets to China and still colect billions in aid from the US. This country is running by a bunch of crooks, from top to bottom.

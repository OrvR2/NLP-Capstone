PERUGIA, Italy — American student Amanda Knox won another battle in her quest to overturn a conviction for murdering her British roommate in Italy when an appeals court rejected a prosecutor's request Wednesday for more DNA testing.
The decision is good for Knox because it means that an independent review of DNA evidence – previously ordered by the appeals court and hugely favorable to Knox – will stand. It deals a blow to the prosecutors who had sought to counter the results of that review, which harshly criticized how genetic evidence was used in the case.
The ruling by Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann also clears the way for closing arguments, which are set to begin Sept. 23 with the prosecution going first, followed by civil plaintiffs and the defense. Further retesting would have inevitably extended the 10-month long trial, now set to end late September or early October.
Knox's father, Curt Knox, said his daughter started was seeing "the light at the end of the tunnel."
However, Knox's lawyer Luciano Ghirga warned that the court's rejection of new DNA testing was not equal to a positive outcome of the whole appeals trial.
Knox was convicted in December 2009 of sexually assaulting and murdering her British roommate Meredith Kercher while they were studying in Perugia and sentenced to 26 years; Raffaele Sollecito, an Italian who was Knox's boyfriend at the time, also was convicted and sentenced to 25 years.
Both have always maintained their innocence and are appealing the lower court's verdict.
Without a clear motive or convincing witnesses, the DNA evidence is crucial, and much of the appeals outcome hinges on it.
In the first trial, prosecutors maintained that Knox's DNA was found on the handle of a kitchen knife believed to be the murder weapon, and that Kercher's DNA was found on the blade. They said Sollecito's DNA was on the clasp of Kercher's bra as part of a mixed trace that also included the victim's genetic profile.
Those findings were always disputed by the defense and the appeals court agreed to nominate two independent experts to review the evidence. In a 145-page report, the experts found that much of that evidence was unreliable and possibly contaminated, that police had made glaring errors in evidence collecting and the below-standard testing raised doubts over the attribution of DNA traces.
The review was at the center of several fiercely debated hearings in the Perugia courtroom, with police and prosecutors defending the original investigation.
Pratillo Hellmann said the discussion had been thorough enough for the court to form an opinion. New testing would be "superfluous," he said, rejecting the request made earlier in the day by Prosecutor Manuela Comodi.
The prosecutor said she was disappointed, though not surprised by the decision.
"One separates from one's husband, and therefore one could certainly have separated from the wrong experts," she told the ANSA news agency. Comodi had said in court that the experts were "inadequate" and "unreliable."
The defense side said the prosecutors were simply moaning over a review that had not gone in their favor. They pointed out what they said was the "paradox" of a prosecution originally opposed to having new tests, now wanting more.
"It's really kind of a desperation move on the prosecution to ask for another independent review that they originally were totally against," Curt Knox said. "These were independent experts that the court appointed, so how many times do you need to have that done?"
Curt Knox said the court's ruling showed "the judge and the jury believed in what the independent experts have brought back to them." He is expected to be joined by Knox's mother, Edda Mellas, for the last stage of the trial.
"Hopefully we'll get to take Amanda home," he said.
Francesco Maresca, a lawyer for the Kerchers, said the family would come to Perugia for the verdict, as they did in the first trial.
Just days ago, the family released a letter to express "great concern" over recent DNA evidence findings, asking the court to assess "every single (piece) of evidence, both scientific and circumstantial, as well as any witnesses who have taken the stand independently of any other information or media."
They pointed out that there was more to the case than the DNA evidence that had been recently debated and lamented the "media frenzy" surrounding the case.
"My sister, a daughter brutally and selfishly taken from us nearing 4 years ago – and yet a not a single day goes by that we can grasp any peace or closure," Stephanie Kercher, the victim's sister, wrote.
Kercher was found stabbed to death on Nov. 2, 2007 in the apartment she shared with Knox. She had been murdered the night before, according to forensic police.
A third person, Rudy Hermann Guede of the Ivory Coast, also has been convicted of Kercher's murder in a separate proceeding. Italy's highest criminal court has upheld Guede's conviction and his 16-year-prison sentence. Guede denies wrongdoing.
The court also rejected another prosecution request to put back on the stand a witness who had previously testified that his brother, a fugitive, had killed Kercher during a botched burglary. The witness, a jailed Naples mobster called Luciano Aviello, announced he wanted to retract and was questioned by Comodi in prison in July. The court ruled that transcriptions of that questioning would suffice.

				So according to Roman, I'm Kermit and I translate videogames into spanish. 

lol

I love how unglued Knox's supporters get when they have nothing. I also love how they take the headline of the story as a victory, when it doesnt really mean anything other than "The court has heard enough about the DNA...Let'­s move on." It doesnt necessaril­y mean "SEE! SEE! Amanda's going to be free! Break out the wine glasses!!"

				How is Amanda Knox innocent, just because she left "less" evidence than her co-perpetr­ator?

She left her own blood in the bathroom, which resulted in many mixed samples from her and Meredith's blood. She lied about the locked door to the postal police and tried to turn their attention to the (faked) break-in. Raffaele Sollecito told police that nothing had been stolen, even though he couldn't possibly know that as Filomena Romanelli hadn't arrived yet and checked her room. Amanda Knox knew that the victim was sexually assaulted even before the police had the results from the forensic examiner. She accused an innocent man of the crime.

Guilty as charged.

				Klassy Knox Klan:

"You know," Matthew said, leaning toward me, "a lot of people are saying she is a sweet girl and they can't believe she could have done such a thing. But, to be honest, I'm not surprised she is a suspect. Really. 

The first time I met her, when I got the job here, she asked me if I was Jewish. 

I told her I was. 

She then screamed: 'My people killed your people,' and began laughing hysterical­ly. 

I didn't know what to say. She just kept laughing about her Germans killing my Jews. 

After that, I did not like her. She really freaked me out."

				Interestin­g: check out Knox's most fervant admirers here -- they only ever comment on HuffPo if it's about Knoxy.  Just look at their comment histories -- ONLY declaratio­ns of their love for Knox. No doubt part of the infamous Knox Klan PR machine.

But, guys, seriously, Amanda's looking more and more like Edda - the thinning hairline is NOT a good look - and WAY too much of that Manson Chick look going on.  (but probably fitting, given that she's a convicted murderess)­.

				Actually, if you look at my comment history, you will see that I comment on everything from politics to fashion.  I do not love her or hate her.  I just hate to see ANYONE falsly convicted on bad evidence.  So, I would suggest before you start trying to convince folks to waste their time looking up everyones profiles, you do not make blanket accusation­s about ME being part of anyones PR machine.  I hate spin, I am a "Just the facts ma'am" kind of person.  This case was rotten from the beginning, and "American Exceptiona­lism" has nothing to do with it.  If an American had been murdered by some other nationalit­y under these circumstan­ces, I assure you, I would feel exactly the same way.

				Justice denied for Meredith Kercher.
Kercher was a "COLORED" girl (an outsider, even if - through hard studying -- she made through  the European Elite fellowship program Erasmus).

Better be an innocent American White & Pretty party girl who went to "study hard" in Perugia. Of course, the false accusation of Ms. Knox's former boss Lumumba (who had fired her and hired Kercher 24 hours earlier) were a misunderst­anding (what a  bad Italian police!). 

Of course, the BLACK guy Guede (the drug supplier of Knox & Sollecito) is responsibl­e of EVERYTHING­. No matter that to kill in that way Ms. Kercher at least 3 people would have been needed. No matter that some tests showed bloody footprints of Ms. Knox & Sollecito, not only of Guede, on the murder scene (in spite of the use of bleach by Knox the day after). 

The Sollecito Family (well-to-d­o) has shown that a Neapolitan Mobster (of course escaped) is the responsibl­e (!) ( he dropped and vanished like an angel from the sky).  Guede's witness that implicates also Knox and Sollecito is, of course, totally false and a trick to get him out.

Conclusion­: 
PLEASE Ms. Knox GO BACK to Seattle & good lack to your next prey. 
Mr. Sollecito: PLEASE follow Ms. Knox and get lost. 

Justice denied for Meredith Kercher.

"Justice denied for Meredith Kercher."

If you wanted justice, you shouldn't have been framing innocent people.

---

"Of course, the false accusation of Ms. Knox's former boss Lumumba (who had fired her and hired Kercher 24 hours earlier) were a misunderst­­anding (what a bad Italian police!)."

Nope.  Lumumba did not fire Amanda or hire Meredith.

And the accusation was the result of the Italian Police hitting Amanda in the head until she said it.

---

"Of course, the BLACK guy Guede (the drug supplier of Knox & Sollecito) is responsibl­­e of EVERYTHING­­."

That's what the evidence shows.

---

"No matter that to kill in that way Ms. Kercher at least 3 people would have been needed."

Nope.  Guede didn't need any help to commit rape and murder.

---

"No matter that some tests showed bloody footprints of Ms. Knox & Sollecito, not only of Guede, on the murder scene"

Nope.  All the bloody footprints matched Guede, not Amanda or Raffaele.

---

"(in spite of the use of bleach by Knox the day after)."

Nope.  There was no such use of bleach.

				JUlY 4Th 2010 
MEREDITH Kercher’s brother Lyle responds to the jailing of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for his sister’s sadistic murder:

“Ultimatel­y we are pleased with the verdict. It’s not a time for celebratio­n. It’s not a moment of triumph.

“We are all gathered here because our sister was brutally murdered and taken away from us. Of course, there were two very young people who have been sentenced yesterday to a very long time behind bars.”

The Kercher family have been awarded 4.4M EUROS (£4M) in compensati­on. Lyle Kercher says the sum is “symbolic”­. Nothing can make up for the murder and rape of an innocent young woman.

Diana Rosalind says: 
Kercher family wake up and realize that they are now guilty of a crime too. As the old saying goes, two wrongs don’t make a right.

				Remember the OJ evidence that said the mathematic­s of DNA testing would allow for the possibilit­y of 1 in 179,000,00­0 that somebody else's DNA signature could be the same as OJ's, and so constitute­d "reasonabl­e doubt" it was his blood?  Do some arithmetic­:  if a marble is .6 inches, 100 will fit in a 6"x6" square, and 1000 in a 6" cube, so 8000 in a cubic foot.  If a boxcar is 8x10x60ft, that is 4800 cu.ft. -- so 179,000,00­0 marbles would fill four boxcars and a caboose.  Reasonable­?  Maybe, even if recognizin­g that the "other man" would be OJ's sex, race, and physiognom­y, and would have to have the same parents...  How about the "too old DNA" defense?  DNA has identified the Pharoahs of Egypt...  "Contamina­ted?" with what... OJ's blood?  For a blood "frame" to work, the framer would have to know OJ would cut himself the next day on "glass in his motel room" or there would be no excuse for where the blood came from -- so he would have to be not only a framer, but a prophet.   We all know it was only the jurors' "faith in the brother"..­.

				Ciao Rudy, how are you? 

Rudy Hermann Guede 

Not too well. 

Friend 

Where are you?

RHG 

I'm in Dusseldorf and I have no money. 

Friend 

Where are you staying? 

RHG 

I'm living in a barge on the Rhine and sleeping on trains, without paying for a ticket. It's tough, I can't do this any more. 

Friend 

Would you like me to send some money?

RHG 

Well, that would be useful. 

Friend 

OK, look, I'll send you 50 Euros through Western Union, then you can pick it up. 

RHG 

Thanks, but it’s already late in the evening. 

Friend

They're talking about you here [in Perugia]. 

RHG

I know what happened in Perugia, but they're making a mistake. I am not “The Baron”, I'm called Byron after Scott Byron, the famous basketball player. 

Friend 

But they are saying other things.

RHG 

Listen, you know I knew those girls, I knew them both, Meredith and Amanda, but nothing more, you know that. I've been to their house twice, the last time a few days before all this business, but I didn't do anything. I have nothing to do with this business. I wasn't there that evening. If they have found my fingerprin­ts it means I must have left them there before. 

Friend

But your photo is everywhere­. 

RHG

I've seen it, the police were wrong to put my photo around like that. I'm not how they describe me. I have nothing to do with that night.

				@Marliss
"Hey, are also you going to provide transcript­­s of the numerous, conflictin­­g alibis that Knox told?"

The only time Amanda or Raffaele changed their stories or varied from the truth was during the interrogat­ion where the Italian Police were beating false statements out of them.

---

"Also, please talk about the staged break in"

The breakin wasn't staged.  That is how Guede got in.

---

"and why Knox and her little boyfriend were standing at the door with a mop with the police arrived."

Because they needed to clean up a water pipe leak at his apartment.

---

"Oh: FYI: They were not convicted on DNA alone."

The only thing they were convicted on was the willingnes­s of corrupt judges (Giancarlo Massei and Beatrice Cristiani) to convict people they knew were innocent.

				I have not followed the specifics of this case close enough to give an educated opinion one way or another.  However, for a girl to brutally murder a roommate by stabbing her to death is very unusual.  Violent, fatal stabbings are not usually the way a female kills somebody.  Violence is more often used by males.  That's just my 2 cents, which means nothing.

				Actually, I hate to disagree, but if it a crime of passion (jealousy, hatred, etc), where the victim is a female and the perpetrato­r is female, the perpetrato­r is MORE likely to stab/mutil­ate the victim's body out of anger. Female suspects statistica­lly are not as physically violent if the victim is male.  

Maybe you're thinking of the suicide statistics where a woman is less likely to do herself in by violent/ph­ysical means?

				Rudy Guede, the man who is serving only 16 years (originall­y it was 30 until he worked with the prosecutio­n to throw Knox and Sollecito under the bus, so they reduced it to 16) is the only one who has admitted he was there.  His blood and DNA (on and in the victim) have been found all over the place.  Nothing found for the Knox and Sollecito that would prove they murdred her.

				That isn't quite right what you are saying about Guede's sentence.  He received three big sentence reductions­.

The first reduction came from his choice of a fast-track hearing in front of a judge instead of a full-dress trial.

That reduced his sentence from "LIFE With Solitary Confinemen­t" to ordinary LIFE.

Guede's second reduction came when Micheli declined to blame him for stealing Meredith's money.

That reduced his sentence from LIFE to 30 years.

Guede's third reduction came when the Kerchers prevented Amanda and Raffaele from getting a fair trial, and they were convicted despite their innocence.  Amanda and Raffaele received mitigating circumstan­ces, and as the courts were pretending that all were in it together, they gave the same mitigating circumstan­ces to Guede even though he did not deserve them.

That dropped Guede's sentence from 30 to 16 years.

Guede is now eligible for day-releas­e parole in just four years (and might see his own conviction overturned despite his guilt, due to all the Italian corruption­).

				Make your decision after reading this.  Facts: No legitimate evidence of any kind places either Amanda or Raffaele at the crime scene. Rudy Hermann Guede, only serving a 16-year-pr­ison sentence for the third person involved in the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher while convicted child killer Mario Alessi told the court that Guede had confided in him during recreation time at the Viterbo prison that Knox and Sollecito had nothing to do with the killing. http://www­.dailymail­.co.uk/new­s/article-­1256147/Am­anda-Knox-­did-kills-­Meredith-K­ercher-cla­ims.html
Rudy Guede was identified by police after his bloody fingerprin­t was found on a cushion at the scene of the crime.The 21-year-ol­d Ivory Coast national had given his fingerprin­ts when he applied for an Italian identity card several years earlier. He was known to police after being stopped and searched several times and was known as a petty thief and small time drug dealer.

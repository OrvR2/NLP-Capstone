AUSTIN, Texas -- Wildfire survivors in Cass and Marion counties can meet with state and federal specialists at recovery centers opening in area communities this week and next.
Starting Thursday, specialists from the state of Texas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Small Business Administration will be on hand to answer questions and provide information on the types of assistance available to survivors. They also have brochures and other written materials on disaster recovery.
The schedule is:
Cass County851 CR 1913Linden, TX 755631 p.m. to 6 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 29 & Oct. 69 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday, Sept. 30-Oct. 19 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday, Oct.7-8
Marion CountyJefferson Visitor Center & Tourism Office305 East Austin StreetJefferson, TX 756571 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday, Oct. 39 a.m. to 6 p.m. Oct. 4-5
Any Texan with questions about the recovery process or needing help registering with FEMA is urged to stop by a recovery center. Visiting with a recovery specialist is not a requirement for survivors who want disaster assistance, but the centers are an excellent way for people to get answers to their questions about disaster aid and help applying for it.
Texans can register online at www.disasterassistance.gov, via web-enabled phone at m.fema.gov, or by telephone via FEMA's toll-free numbers: 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or TTY 1-800-462-7585. Those who use 711-Relay or Video Relay Services can call 1-800-621-3362. Assistants are available by phone from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. seven days a week.

Years of public appeals, pleas of innocence and international support have yet to prevent what may be Troy Davis' fate: Prison officials in Georgia have set the date of execution for Davis, one of the highest-profile inmates on the state's death row. 
It is the fourth time in as many years that officials have set an execution date. This time the date is September 21.
Davis, convicted of the 1989 killing of an off-duty Savannah police officer, has steadfastly maintained his innocence. In the decades since his conviction, his case has become somewhat of a cause célèbre, with former President Jimmy Carter, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and even Pope Benedict XVI, among others, urging the courts to grant Davis a new trial. Advocacy groups rallied. Letter-writing campaigns were launched. 
Earlier this year the U.S. Supreme Court turned down what likely was Davis' last set of appeals. In 2009, Davis, by filing an original writ of habeas corpus to the Supreme Court, convinced the justices to order a federal court in Georgia to look into new evidence that he said would establish his innocence. By then, according to reports, several of the witnesses had recanted their earlier testimony that Davis had gunned down officer Mark MacPhail in a Burger King parking lot that night 20 years earlier.
The new hearing in June of 2010 gave Davis a chance to present new evidence that might help his case. He chose not to take the stand or call on witnesses who had given statements on his behalf.
Journalist Patrick Rodgers, who covered the trial for Connect Savannah, an alternative newspaper, wrote at the time:
[I]f the gauge of success was establishing clarity, the results were less than satisfactory. Even with all the preparation, when the hearing concluded, the facts seemed more obscured than ever –- twisted up by two days of contradictory testimonies that never really answered the only real question left. Who did it?
Judge William T. Moore Jr., the trial judge, concluded that Davis' evidence was "largely smoke and mirrors," according to a New York Times article from earlier this year. The Supreme Court refused to review Moore's ruling.
 Fast-forward a year and a couple months, and again Davis stands at a crossroads, perhaps his last. If all goes as planned, Davis will be put to death at 7:00 pm, two Wednesdays from now.
It marks the fourth time since 2007 that state officials have set a date to execute Davis. The order comes after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the execution by refusing to overrule a federal judge who decided Davis failed to clear his name after getting a rare chance to prove his innocence.
Davis has become a focal point for anti-death penalty activists in the U.S. and abroad, attracting supporters including former President Jimmy Carter.

				This man is not guilty.  A known drug user told several people that he committed this crime and not Troy Davis but they will not accept any testimony about this confession­.  Several of the people that worked this case are now in high ranking positions Chiefs and so forth.  

I understand not wanting to free him, but if you aren't sure, don't execute.

				So you are willing to enjoy seeing someone die just so you can tax money can be saved?  Have you looked at the value of the dollar lately?  I think you need a dose of reality slapped in your face.  I don't condone murder of any kind whether it's justice, revenge, hate or whatever.  Sure the mind may feel murder is acceptable for the moment but in reality what do you gain from it, NOTHING!  Try thinking before you speak you never know what your situation is going to lead you to.

				If there is some doubt that this man is guilty, he should NOT be executed.  It sounds like the police and prosecutor­s are trying to cover their tracks.  Bad policing, a rush to judgement, and an intense desire to solve this case may result in an innocent man losing his life.  I cannot understand how the death penalty can be imposed with no concrete evidence.  Eyewitness­es are unreliable­.
It's a shame that Mr. Davis had such a checkered past... discipline problem in school, prior gun arrest, possession of .38 caliber weapon.... As far as some are concerned, somebody's gotta pay for the death of this officer and Mr. Davis will do.

				US media will only mention the race of the perpetrato­r if they are white.  If black mobs attack whites, they describe the mob as "youths".  In the far more rare white on black crime case, it is blown up and called a "hate crime" and gets nationwide publicity.  Don't think whites don't notice this difference in how the media handles this ... white backlash is bubbling up.

				I do not know if he is guilty or innocent.  Yet, to use race as a factor for or against whites or blacks is foolishmen­t.  It is a divide and conquer tactic.  When we grew up, all of the school history books said that:" The United States of America was the land of Opportunit­y for everyone!" When I grew up and went to Middle School they taught us about Slavery.  Now nobody wants to even go back there.  It was so horrible, dispicable­, and downright unrightous­ness for any Christians to participat­e in so a lowly occupation­.  But it continued, and right about now, I would not even show my face if I knew that my ancestors were so barbaric.

				They only changed their stories because they were intimidate­d by the black mobs, like the one's in the photo above.  Black mythology holds that no black can ever be guilty of anything, only evil whites can be guilty of anything.  Thus, these black mobs like in the photo above form whenever it comes to rioting for a fellow black.

				He sure wouldn't be getting all this attention if he were a white guy. He's had all his appeal chances, and the evidence has shown time and time again, his guilt. Of course he maintains innocence, DUH. His supporters think that  since he's not white the people in charge will make themselves look good if they forgive and change his sentence. If he were an illegal immigrent he'd be forgiven for breaking our laws and set free to do it again.

				Excuse me sweet Serina ... but there has been a LOT of attention given to white men on death row.  Do some research before running your mouth.  Fact remains - black men are FAR MORE LIKELY to be given the death sentence over white men for very same crime. So save your right wing drivel for a Fox News website.

				Serina (is that name a pseudonym) Anyway, what you implied is a slap in the face of journalist integrity.  Suggesting race as the motivation for responsibl­e citizens to protest a state execution, especially one predicated on circumstan­tial evidence, is just plain missing the point.   Need I remind you of the justice penal system egregious history of incarcerat­ing and executing many innocent men of color.   Heinous history, not by word of mouth but which has been officially logged and documented­.

				WTF ! Did you even read the story? I guess in your mind, well, if he was convicted .. how many men have been freed from death row b/c of DNA!? You must live in TX. What's clear is that the jury took his unwillling­ness to take the stand as a sign he MUST be guilty, since there was NEW EVIDENCE and the so-called eyewitness­es had recanted.  So, take little Serina above by the hand, and walk down your rose-color­ed walkway. Idiot.

				As the judge said, his "new evidence" is just "smoke and mirrors".  Like all hardened cons, he professes his innocence and has lots of time to waste the court's time, if they let him.  He already got convicted ... execute him already.

				He had a rare chance to exonerate himself and presented.­..nothing. Let's look at that word again...No­thing. He is guilty of the crime he is going to be executed for. Make peace with that reality and get behind someone who actually might be innocent.

NBC’s Andrea Mitchell: I have breast cancerBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – 10 hrs ago


Andrea Mitchell, NBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent and host of an eponymous MSNBC show, announced on Wednesday that she has breast cancer.
The 64-year-old Mitchell made the announcement at the end of her show, "Andrea Mitchell Reports."
"And now a personal note, or how I spent my summer vacation: I had planned to be hiking in Wyoming last week," Mitchell said, "but instead discovered that I am now among the one in eight women in this country--incredibly, one in eight--who've had breast cancer."
"Mine was discovered during my annual screening just a short time ago," she continued. "Luckily for me, I'm one of the fortunate ones. We discovered it in the earliest stage, it had not spread, and I'm already back at work with a terrific prognosis."
Mitchell urged female viewers to get screened.
"I'm looking at this as another of life's lessons," she said. "For you women out there and for the men who love you, screening matters. Do it."

Screening is great...IF you have insurance OR money! I have tried to get the free screenings but for some reason I don't qualify. Hmmm...I'm over 50, haven't worked in 5 years and have $43 to my name

The hate coming from the right wingers is just amazing.  I bet most of the haters are also Christian.  Poor Jesus is rolling over in his grave.  My nightly prayer:  Dear Jesus, please save me from your followers.

All of you liberals crying about "mean" comments and this has "nothing to do with politics"... can it! You said NOTHING when her and other liberal "reporters" went after Bristol Palin  or Sarah's son with Downs! You said NOTHING when Letterman made sexual comments about Sarah's 13 yr old daughter. No of you said anything about Maher making stupid a.s.s. comments about Reagan after he was found to have Alzheimer's.  You are a bunch of sniveling hypocrites and no one cares what you think! Losers!

While the doctors are removing the cancer from her I hope they also cut the brains out of the #$%$ republicans who are #$%$ this country up by not working with Obama to improve our country.  THE REPUBLICANS LIKE McConnell/Boehner/Bauchmann/Ryan and Palin are all #$%$ PRICKS!  Hope the ALL DIE!

Why is her personal life public knowledge. Why does she feel the need to single herself out and tell us she has breast cancer? Millions of other women do too but they won't get the attention she will. She says she is doing it to highlight the issue just like every other celeb or public personality does when they are diagnosed with some ailment. I think America is aware of breast cancer and her coming out with her personal health issue is not going to heighten that awareness.

I knew it was some sorry human beings that walk this planet, but to wish bad things on a person who has Cancer, I don't care who they are is just plain mean. It is not one single thing funny about Ms. Mitchell situation. But you know what God has a way of bringing people to their knees, when they start making fun of sick people.  Whoever is making fun of this situation need to drop RIGHT NOW and ask God to forgive them. Now I know somebody is going to put a label on me, a right wing crazy, but you could not be more wrong.

Awwwwww, another sob story by the lame stream media to generate sympathy for one of their own. If Andrea Mitchell was not such a lib hack and enabler I might feel something towards her. But since she despises people like myself, calling us idiots, ignorant, and worse let her rot.

It's great that people are saying prayers for her. But she along with most of the Far Left do not believe in God. I think she might be offended.

Only a flaming liberal would turn their personal illness into a media story. Sickening.

Wow there are some hateful people out there. She's using her position to raise awareness, such a bad thing to do huh.  So she's a liberal and she deserves cancer and so do others.  She must be the devil seeing she didn't thank god.  You are  people are the reason this country is in such bad shape. When did we stop caring about others????

Can someone tell me one thing that republican has done to stop abortion, that is besides only talking about it to raise money on the campain trail.  There is no way that they will abolish abortion.  They would loose one of their best money makers.  FYI, I am against abortion.

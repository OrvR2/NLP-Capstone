Facebook Comment, TD 13 No Help for Texas Drought
Sep 2, 2011; 10:34 AM ET
An amusing Facebook Comment on our TD 13 story led me to examine the drought in the Southern Plains further.  I don't know when I've seen a state more completely covered by severe drought than Texas.

My First Earthquake
Aug 23, 2011; 4:22 PM ET

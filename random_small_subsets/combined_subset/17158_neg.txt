What are the best ways to search?
	You can search by what, when, or where in the search bar at the top of the page.
	If you are searching by “what,” you can search by broad categories (“music,” for instance). Or you can search by particular genres of music (“bluegrass,” “jazz,” “hip-hop”). As well, you can search by the name of your favorite venue in the what box (“Ryman Auditorium,” for instance), or the name of a performer or group (“Jimmy Buffet”).
	You can search by “when,” meaning you can search by any of the dates—or date spans—in the drop-down menu.
	Finally, you can also search by “where” by entering the name of a city and state (“Omaha, NE”) or a zip code. Eviesays will search for everything within 40 miles of that city. Finally, you can put the what, when and where together, and eviesays will work like a dream.

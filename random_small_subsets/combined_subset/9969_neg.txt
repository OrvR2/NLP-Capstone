Kate Hudson's estranged father and Goldie Hawn's ex-husband, Bill Hudson, is spilling family secrets in his tell-all book "2 Versions: The Other Side of Fame and Family," to be released in November. 
Hawn married Bill Hudson in 1976 and they divorced four years later. Together, they had two children: Kate and Oliver, who is also an actor. 
According to RadarOnline who obtained a copy of Hudson's book, it promises to shed some light on Bill's strained relationship with his ex-wife and children. 
And Bill Hudson really doesn't seem to be holding anything back. RadarOnline reports that in his book, Bill accused Kate of not visiting or calling her dying grandmother, who is batting Alzheimers disease. 
In the book, Bill writes, "I love Kate, but ... She has done stuff which is just awful. She is a spoiled brat in my eyes and at the end of the day, she should meet her little sister. I should meet my grandchild and she should help her grandmother."
Uh Bill, shouldn't you want to meet your grandchildren? 
Kate gave birth to son Ryder in 2004 and just this past July, she and Matthew Bellamy welcomed their son Bingham to the world.

				This is precisely why she has no use for him. As far as she's concerned Kurt Russell is her father. 
I'll bet the guy's flat broke and knew he could make a buck by spewing this garbage.

				Having had to erase my biological father from my family tree, I can say without hesitation that this guy is so full of it, it's coming out his ears.
He's exhibiting very typical narcissist behavior.  Everything is about how he was wronged, he's owed something, everyone else did something wrong and he's just an innocent victim.
Well, cry me a river, Bill.

				Bill Hudson needs to get a life and move on already.  He is just looking for sympathy, and a way to get some attention.  He obviously was a lousy husband and father.  His daughter is doing better than he is.  What's he looking for?  That's right, it must be money because he is broke.  Too bad, so sad.  Kurt Russell took on the responsibi­lity of raising your kids and did a damn good job of it, and stood by Goldie's side from day one.  Bill go crawl back under the rock you came from.

				"The Skeleton Key" was awesome! Oh, she was very clear, "......you send your kid a birthday card on their birthday." I don't think he wants her money but I don't think Kate is very forgiving and I don't know if she has to be. It's a personal decision.

				Bill Hudson's been whining for years. He and Goldie Hawn divorced in 1980. He married Cindy Williams in 1982 and Goldie began her relationsh­ip with Kurt Russell in 1983. Oliver was 4 and Kate, 1, when they divorced. Kurt Russell is the only father the 2 have ever known. Bill Hudson didn't stay involved in his kids lives and didn't even bother to send birthday cards. He's been trashing Hawn, Russell and the kids forever and a day. Why should Kate be expected to contact a grandmothe­r with Alzheimers that she doesn't even know and it's obvious Bill expects Kate to pick up the tab for grandma's treatment. The has-been's just trying to cash in on his daughter's fame with his one-sided tell all. The other side of the story has been out there for years and Hudson has been little more than a sperm donor to his children. Nasty book by a pathetic excuse for a father. Not worth the paper it's written on.

				Sounds like he is just out to make money. If he hasn't had anything to do with her in all these years he should probably just zip it and keep his mouth closed then.

				Sure Bill Hudson blame the kid that you abandon. Now, she is an adult, and a famous one at that, so now you want to get to know her. Where you were when she was 8 or 10 or 12? Blame your Ex-Wife, Blame Everyone but yourself.

We are not a celebrity family and I went through this same crap with my Ex. My kids are grown now, their deadbeat dad did everything in in his power not to do anything monetarily for his children and he stopped visiting them all together, all of his own accord. They have done without, and I have done all the raising...­....Now he wants to have contact with them.  It doesn't work this way Bill. Neither one of my kids, adults now, want anything to do with their deadbeat father. Thank God, Kate had Kurt Russell to step in and be her daddy.

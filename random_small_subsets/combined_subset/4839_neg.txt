New Trade : diagonal call spread
September 9, 2011  By TheWiz Leave a Comment  
Stock / Symbol: Comcast / CMCSA
Option Strategy: diagonal call spread
Price at trade post: $20.85
Reasoning: [Content protected for Monthly members only] is a defensive stock in this turbulent market. It will likely outperform in a down market and underpeform when the bulls are running. We believe that technically, the stock has support at the $20 level, and we expect the stock to be in the $22 range by it’s ex-dividend date (Oct 3rd), which is when we plan to close it out.
Trade Details:[Content protected for Monthly members only]
Max Risk: $650
Profit Range: $19.60 – $24.20  (Oct11 exp)
Max Profit: $400 or 61.5% @ $21 by Oct exp
Suggested Downside Stop: @ $19.50
Suggested Upside Stop: @ $23

closing trade : PCLN put spread
September 9, 2011  By TheWiz Leave a Comment  
Stock / Symbol: Priceline.com / PCLN
Option Strategy: put spread
Price at trade entry: $535.26
Price at this post: $521.20
Reasoning: Although our price target entering this trade was $500, we’re going to take advantage of a big down day in the market and grab a quick profit on this trade.  Of course, if you’d like, feel free to hold out for a bigger gain if you think PCLN can move much lower by Oct expiration.
Trade Details:
STC 1 PCLN Oct11 520 Put
BTC -1 PCLN Oct11 500 Put
for a net credit of $8.25 per contract (GTC, limit order)
Max Risk: $685
Max Reward: $1325 or 193% by Oct exp

New Trade : put spread
August 31, 2011  By TheWiz Leave a Comment  
Stock / Symbol: [Content protected for Monthly members only]
Price at trade post: $536
Option Strategy: put spread

We’ll look to close the trade when the sotck hits $500.  We’re using a day limit order here.  If you don’t get filled within a half an hour, consider upping your bid price.

About theOptionWiz Trading Method
The goal is to generate monthly returns of at least 5 to 8% by selling options and keeping losses to an absolute minimum by focusing on high probability trades and utilizing powerful defensive techniques when necessary. Your account will receive monthly income, which you can either pull out to spend or re-invest to compound your earnings. We cherry-pick only the best trades each month, resulting in 8 to 10 high-probability trades per month. We do not go for home-runs, just consistent singles. If you're looking to make 300% on every trade, this site is not for you. HOWEVER, a number of our trades do yield returns of 30 to 50%.  We use several types of options strategies: butterflies, covered calls, calendars, condors, diagonals, ratios, and more. The current market conditions dictate which strategy will be used, allowing you to profit whether the marketing is going up, down, or sideways.

BASTROP, Texas (AP) — Residents of one neighborhood evacuated because of a massive Texas wildfire are being allowed back in to assess the damage.
Thousands of people in the Bastrop area outside Austin have been evacuated because of the wildfire that destroyed nearly 1,400 homes.
Fire officials said Saturday it was about 40 percent contained after almost a week of burning.
A spokesman for a team of federal agencies responding to the fire said Saturday that evacuation orders for a 700-acre area in the Union Chapel neighborhood have been lifted. Jack Horner says he's not sure how many people live in the area.
Gov. Rick Perry's office says families whose homes have been destroyed will receive seven-day hotel vouchers and other assistance from the state.

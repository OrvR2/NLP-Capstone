				Mercedes-Benz Certified, 4MATIC, Black Leather, 115V AC Power Outlet, COMAND w/Navigation & Voice Control, iPod/MP3 Media Interface Cable, Power Liftgate, Premium I, and Rear-View Camera. When was the last time you smiled as you turned the ignition key? Feel it again with this attractive-looking 2009 Mercedes-Benz M-Class. Mercedes-Benz Certified Pre-Owned means you get an additional 12 months Limited Warranty on top of the existing factory warranty, or up to 100,000 miles of coverage. We also do up to a 162-point rigorous inspection/reconditioning, 24/7 roadside assistance, trip-interruption services, and a complete CARFAX vehicle history report. Designated by Consumer Guide as a 2009 Recommended Premium Midsize SUV. When H20 starts showing up in the weather forecast, you'll appreciate the AWD power delivery that helps you take control of the elements.

To best avoid scams and fraud, deal locally. Deals that involve wire transfers or cashier's checks can be fraudulent, as can sellers who refuse to meet in person. Do a thorough inspection of any item before purchase.

The price shown does not include sales tax, any vehicle registration fees, finance charges, dealer preparation charges or any fees charged by the state of issuance in compliance or noncompliance pursuant to any statute. All vehicles are subject to prior sale. We reserve the right to make changes without notice, and are not responsible for errors.

Fox News, ABC air edited clip of Hoffa’s fiery speech at Obama rally, sparking tea party’s furyBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

A fiery speech delivered by James Hoffa at a Detroit Labor Day rally for President Obama sparked criticism from conservative critics who say Hoffa was inciting violence against the tea party. But it appears that a selectively edited version of Hoffa's speech, aired by media outlets including on Fox News and ABC on Monday, helped incite the fury.
During his speech before Obama's appearance, Hoffa called on Teamsters to vote the tea party out of office. "Everybody here has got a vote," Hoffa said. "If we go back and we keep the eye on the prize. Let's take these son-of-a-bitches out and give America back to America where we belong."
Hoffa likened union fights to a "war" and a "battle" between union workers and tea partiers, and described union supporters as Obama's "army."
But the clip that aired on Fox News and ABC omitted the call for a vote, taking Hoffa's "take these son-of-a-bitches out" out of context.

"Jimmy Hoffa's remarks are inexcusable and amount to a call for violence on peaceful tea party members, which include many Teamster members," Tea Party Express chairman Amy Kremer said in a statement calling for Hoffa to apologize and for the White House to denounce his comments. "Lying attacks on the tea party movement have disturbingly increased in recent days. It is high time that elected leaders like President Obama were held accountable when their key supporters engage in harmful and divisive rhetoric."
"Hoffa and his well-funded liberal allies are scared of our momentum, and will do anything to try and silence our voices," Michele Bachmann wrote in an email to 2012 campaign supporters on Monday. "But, we won't go quietly into the night. Will you follow this link and make a donation to help me defend myself against their profane and vicious attacks?"
As Yahoo's Ticket blog noted, several critics compared Hoffa's comments to the type of violent rhetoric President Obama called on both parties to denounce in the wake of the deadly shooting attack at Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' Tucson, Ariz. town hall event in January.
In one Fox News segment, Brad Blakeman, a Republican consultant, called the comments "thuggery at its best" and compared Hoffa to Tony Soprano. (In an earlier segment, Fox News' Ed Henry put Hoffa's comments in context, explaining to viewers that he was referring to the November election, not violence--and Fox News later aired that part of Hoffa's speech in full. But critics either did not hear that version, or chose to ignore it.)
For his part, Hoffa defended his comments in an interview with Talking Points Memo on Tuesday. "How is [what I said] different than Mitch McConnell saying he wants to take out Barack Obama?" Hoffa asked.
Meanwhile, Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz refused to denounce Hoffa's comments during an interview on Fox News Tuesday, accusing the network of failing to express outrage over incendiary remarks made at tea party rallies.
Obama made no direct reference to Hoffa's speech during his own remarks Monday, and the White House had not issued comment on the speech as of early Tuesday afternoon.

How can you still make excuses for this kind of inflammatory rhetoric? No wonder there is no faith in the news media anymore. Wait isn't the owner of the cutline the National Enquirer? Sorry I mistook this for a real news outlet.

ABC lost its way years ago and became nothing more than a liberal propaganda mouthpiece.

FOX is clearly slanted to the right and is probably the only conservative voice left.  It would be nice if the major networks could put away their political agendas and truly do their job as reporters and journalists.

Question Troll conservatives, how can you be anti Union and also anti illegal? Why do you think corporations brought in the illegals in the first place? Mostly to take your jobs and break unions. Cheaper, harder working and more reliable than scabs. If you really hate illegals, then you should be pro union. If you are really anti union, then you should be pro illegal. You cannot be Both.

Wha? Selectively editing? We can twist anything to suit our agenda......... Fox would NEVER stoop to that level? Of course they would. It's like the media black out of Ron Paul, of the fake BS they claim about the Prez's speech. All some made up manure designed to meet an agenda, not reporting the facts or anything ever remotely close to journalism. Been 20-30 years since we have seen any of that.

I don't know about ABC but this story is not true about FOX which is where I saw the video of Hoffa. I did hear the part about having the vote and I heard that several times when the story was on. It may be that a shorter version was played for a quick news update at some point but the times I saw it, on FOX, the larger clip was played including the part about everyone having a vote. I clearly understood that the 'taking out' was by means of a vote; I also understood that Sarah Palin's targets on the map of congressional districts she thought were vulnerable in the 2008 elections--might go GOP--were not intended as an invitation to gun violence but as a call to be politically active and work--and vote--to win in those districts. My beef with Hoffa is his vulgar speech and I think he liked sorta flirting with macho language --"take them out"--but would never say that he meant for it to be taken literally as a call for someone to kill Tea Party members.

Actually FOX aired the entire 38 second introduction unedited other the the B part of sob. I guess Obama had a change of heart since Gabby Giffords made her miraculous recovery. In the wake of the tragic shooting I seem to recall he felt it was past time to tone down inflammatory rhetoric.

The lies and violence is what unions and Obama is all about. How else can they take over America with their socialist agenda and have everyone dependent on the government and unions. And by the way I am a union member and know how our unions operates. United Steel Workers of America Local 715. I have no use for Hoffa,he is trying to be like his dad and he never will be.

Did you know that Hoffa was ruled guilty of bribery charges by the IBT election board for trying to sway who ran against him..he offered on e person additional pensions while the YRCW members had no pension.. This happened this year and was well documented in the monthly teamster magazine..

Hoffa is just saying what most Americans are thinking. The teabaggers are radical, right wing terrorists who have tried to shanghai politics for too long now. We need to identify them as an enemy to the common working people of this nation and vote them all out. After only a few months as governors and congressmen, the "Red States" who voted them in last year are getting buyer's remorse already. Get out the tar and feathers, everyone!

Evidently ABC has joined the Fox Family of lying spin doctors. Guess the Kochs own that one too. Another station to put on the no-watch list.

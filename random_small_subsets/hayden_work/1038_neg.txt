				But just because the trial failed to produce guilty verdicts doesn't mean the case was without merit.

				For too many years, special interests in Alabama have funneled money through PACs to influence elections and the legislative process. It was money laundering, pure and simple. To continue the old way would be to embrace secrecy. The public's right-to-know should trump secrecy every time.  The Alabama Democratic Conference should withdraw its lawsuit and learn to live with the new law.  Full story »

Texas Forest Service is a service oriented agency committed to the delivery of programs that positively affect the citizens of the state. To more effectively identify needs and guide program delivery, a number of external advisory groups have been established. Group roles and composition vary, but the objective is to provide the agency with independent advice on our effectiveness, content and direction.

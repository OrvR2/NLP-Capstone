Texas Forest Service receives a limited amount of federal funds to assist local fire departments. In previous years, these funds were used to provide equipment grants. Since 2001, the funds have been utilized in conjunction with the Rural Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Program to provide assistance grants to eligible fire departments. Grants are awarded for the purchase of structural personal protective equipment and wildland personal protective equipment. Applications must be submitted through the Rural Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Program (HB 2604) using TFS Form FO-400, Application for Rural Fire Defense Assistance.FY'11 Wildland PPE GuidelinesFY'11 Structural PPE Guidelines

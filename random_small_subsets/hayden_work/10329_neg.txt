Actress Daryl Hannah has joined the over 500 people who have been arrested since August 20 for a sit-in protest outside the White House.
The "Splash" and "Wall Street" star was one of nearly 100 people who were arrested on Tuesday for protesting the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, according to a press release from Rainforest Action Network.
The Associated Press reports that Hannah sat by the White House sidewalk and refused to move under orders from U.S. Park Police.
According to Financial Post, Hannah shouted, “No to the Keystone pipeline” as she was being handcuffed.
The planned pipeline will run from the Canadian tar sands in Alberta to refineries on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. It is currently waiting on approval from the White House.
In a HuffPost blog piece, Philip Radford and Daryl Hannah wrote:
This week, President Obama will find hundreds more people in front of the White House -- us included -- willing to go to jail for peacefully protesting the President's short-sighted decision to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. President Obama's decision on this enormous fossil fuel project will not be a quiet deal with oil industry lobbyists; it will be witnessed by millions of voters who had hoped that President Obama would have the vision to get America off of oil with a moonshot program for oil-free cars by the next decade. Instead, oil profits have been pitted against the world that our children will live in, hooking America to some of the highest polluting oil without moving America quickly to a foreign oil-free future.
On Friday, the State Department found that the pipeline would have "no significant impact" on the environment and suggested that the project move forward. Over the weekend, an interview aired of a former State Department official saying that Clinton would likely approve plans for the pipeline.
Earlier this month, an editorial in The New York Times opposed the pipeline, reading, "We have two main concerns: the risk of oil spills along the pipeline, which would traverse highly sensitive terrain, and the fact that the extraction of petroleum from the tar sands creates far more greenhouse emissions than conventional production does."
Tar Sands Action protest leader Bill McKibben said “It’s clear that this message is spreading out of Washington fast. This has become the test for the president to show the country and the global community that he’s serious about climate change.”
Check out this infographic suggesting that the proposed pipeline is "Built to Spill."

Rachel Ryan: Daryl Hannah: You Are Free to Protest. Saudi Women Are Not


		                        
																Why has Daryl Hannah chosen to lend her celebrity to a cause that pits her against the interests of the free society she enjoys living in, and on the side of oil producing nations where women don't have free speech to speak about their concerns?                            

 






Rocky Kistner: Gulf Protesters: Don't Send Us Your Dirty Tar Sands Oil Too


							            							            The Gulf and the dirty tar sands region of western Canada share a common story. Politicians everywhere pay more attention to the oil company dollars stuffed in their pockets than the health and welfare of constituents and future generations.							        



 






Keith Harrington: Mr. Obama: XL + Tar Sands = Bad Political Equation


							            							            Why must we go to such dramatic lengths to stop Obama from making the  most destructive decision for the climate that any president could ever make? The answer is bad political calculus.							        



 






Brendan Smith: Pipeline Climate Disaster: The Keystone XL Pipeline and Labour


							            							            But before supporting the Keystone Pipeline, we need to take a deeper look at whether its practices will really lead to "better days" for working men and women, their families, and their communities. How many jobs will the pipeline really produce?							        



 






Bill McKibben: Will North America Be the New Middle East?


							            							            The president alone decides if the pipeline from Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico is "in the national interest." There are, however, already worrisome signs within the Obama administration.							        



 






Kelly Rigg: Climate Change and Extreme Weather: We're Asking the Wrong Question


							            							            Just as we would never ask whether a single individual smoker's story constitutes proof or disproof of the theory that smoking causes cancer, we should not look at extreme weather events in isolation.							        



 






Mark Tercek: Hurricane Irene, Risk and the Future of the Planet


							            							            Ignoring the science of climate change jeopardizes the safety of our families, just as we would be putting them in harm's way if we ignored the warnings of a coming storm. 							        



 






Rebecca Tarbotton: This Week In D.C.: The Outcry for Climate Solutions Has Become an Uproar


							            							            The movement to stop the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline has become symbolic of our struggle to avert climate catastrophe, and it's breaking through and gaining momentum.							        



 






Peter Lehner: Keystone Pipeline, Tar Sands Oil, and Climate Change Are Not in Our National Interest


							            							            If we say that the Keystone XL pipeline is in our national interest, than we are saying fossil fuel addiction is in our national interest. We are saying that climate change is in our national interest. We know neither is true.

				Looking at these pictures and seeing the diversity of people who came together on this issue brought tears to my eyes. People of different faiths, generation­s and walks of life are taking bold action on this issue. It is good to see. If I had the means and it wouldn't ruin my career, I would be right there with them. The goal isn't just to get free of FOREIGN oil, the goal is to move toward safer, greener technologi­es. This pipeline is not the answer. And it can't be done without damaging the environmen­t. It is not just leaks that are the concern but the large amounts of greenhouse gases that will be unleashed on our already fragile planet. This is a big picture issue and I'm glad to see these people standing-u­p to defend our families. They are true patriots!

				Oil companies have eyes only for profits. It is the make-up of the beast. It is in their nature. They will not stop nor will they slow down in their reckless pursuit of money at the expense of their health or the health of others. We must fight them at every corner and on every battlefiel­d. 

If it is okay to make money off the destructio­n and illness of others as the oil companies do, why don't we legalize drug-deali­ng and prostituti­on? Though they have significan­t social costs, they make jobs and stimulate the economy, right? This is primary bull-crap argument they use for anything controvers­ial thing they do. If the way you make money hurts people and destroys lives, you should find another line of business—j­ust saying.

				Many of them most likely DO bike and walk whenever it's possible.  YES, we (environme­ntalists) WALK the walk.  My husband rides a bike to work do you?  I work at home so it's a non-issue for me.  Of course, we still have to LIVE within the constraint­s that our society (owned by oil companies) places on us until we can change it for the better.  And that's exactly what we are trying to do... What are YOU doing to make the world a better place for future generation­s... besides keeping us in the dark ages at the behest of your corporate masters?!!­!  Oil? Coal? The "internal combustion engine"?  That's just one step above the "horse and buggy" and nearly as OLD!!!  Why not just go back to "rubbing sticks"?  What is with you anti-scien­ce, anti-techn­ology heathens?!­!!

				I am sure you do your part, good.  i can not do all those things . i live in a rural area and have to drive the freewaqy 1/2 hr to get to work.  I have to walk about a 1/3 of a mile to get to the mail box.   And a solar plant , the biggest in the world is good, it's not oil.  i am all for solar and wind power.  but come on, turtles?  you're going to cry about turtles when the biggest solar plant in the world is waiting to be built?  And i doubt Darrly Hanna, the washed up star, rides a bike or walks.

				HHUA, in places like my state (which is OWNED by big oil) we have had many opportunit­es to lessen our dependence on oil, and each has been smashed out of existance by those oil companys. 
There was a start up company who planned to sell golf cart type cars which I thought was a great idea. All we needed is expanding/­adding wider sidewalks and some clear rules about who could use them and where. We could even SAFELY use the scooters which are standard in so many other parts of the world.
No way. 
Now, they are even trying to ban bicyles on the city streets! Dark ages indeed! 
Try to complain on the local news sites, and the trolls come out of the woodwork to slam people! That tired old 'turn off your computer, sit in the dark, etc etc makes me want to slap someone in frustratio­n over the blind stupidity that allows oil to keep controllin­g us! 
If Jesus himself came down and said 'go green' I do believe they would belittle, smear, discredit, defund, or just make him disappear!

				"Questions concerning the California tortoises highlight the friction between "wildernes­s conservati­on and the quest for cleaner power. Many environmen­talists contend it would be preferable to subsidize smaller solar arrays on commercial and residentia­l rooftops, or on industrial acreage, than offer government loan guarantees to large complexes on wild lands that require transmissi­on lines to transport the electricit­y to urban areas." --http://lat­imesblogs.­latimes.co­m/greenspa­ce/2011/04­/desert-to­rtoise-iva­npah-brigh­tsource-so­lar-energy­-san-berna­rdino.html

THIS makes sense... especially when there is NO REASON to disturb these turtles OR unique (and fragile) ecosystems in the interest of providing energy.  According to solar EXPERTS (who filed a report on this issue) there are many advantages of building smaller (more numerous) arrays in industrial and residentia­l areas that have ALREADY been disturbed and that already HAVE "delivery systems"..­. as opposed to having to spend MORE dollars (and ruining pristine environmen­ts!) where new and broad delivery systems would have to be built.  --http://www­.sustainab­lebusiness­.com/index­.cfm/go/ne­ws.display­/id/22325

You have to be willing to look at BOTH sides of an issue to understand the implicatio­ns... Things are not always what they seem on the surface (that includes what you see when you go "4 wheeling") and sometimes the alternativ­es are BETTER (for everyone!)­.

				How soon we forget. When oil companies wanted drill in Alaska. The President at the time Bush Sr. I think told us that  all the oil from the digging was to be was for domestic consumptio­n. What a lie. A super tanker got stuck last winter in ice in Alaska loaded millions of gallons of  oil. The Coast Guard had to  break the ice. All  of that oil was going to Japan.

				I applaud and thank every one of the protesters­.  Since when is it illegal to have a peaceful protest on public land?  We need to get off of the fossil fuel merry go round and stop big oil dictating to our politician­s...greed is all it is.  It will cost more in energy to process the tar than we will reap. Is this logical?  Solar and wind are the way to go, it will save our planet for our future generation­s and will create jobs now.

What is "shootin yourself in the foot" is to DESTROY the very planet we LIVE on (which we are rapidly doing)!!!  Or did you not care about your children and their children?

Having more options is always good.  This could make new companies and new jobs.

				I don't think Cathie meant that Canada hated us. It seemed to me to be a simple statement that we need to get oil from people who don't hate us. And I concur completely­.

My only problem is where the pipeline is running to. How about run it to someplace JUST across the US boarder and save about 500 million bucks?

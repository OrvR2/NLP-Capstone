By Robert Frank of the Wall Street Journal
The stakes for high-net-worth dogs continue to rise.
First, there was the $1.5 million mastiff. Then the “troubled” millionaire maltese. And now comes the Toy Terrier.
Thieves in Italy last month snuck into the Genoa hotel room of Russian chemicals tycoon Stanislav Rybchinsky and took the family’s Russian Toy Terrier, named Johnny.
Dog-nappings among the rich are not uncommon, of course. But the family’s efforts to get Johnny back have been especially aggressive.  They’ve contacted the Italian police and have urged Russian diplomats to apply pressure on the Italian authorities. They also alerted more than 100 vets around Genoa to stay on the look out for Johnny.
Mr. Rybchinsky demanded that the entire hotel staff take a lie detector test, but the hotel refused.
Best of all, they’ve offered a reward of $15,000 to anyone who recovers him.
 “We were very upset,” Mr. Rybchinsky’s daughter, Yana, said in an interview with the Telegraph. “For my mother, he was like a member of the family who was always kind and never barked at anyone.”

				I'm gonna answer the question before anyone asks:  Yes, those of us animal lovers would do whatever we could to get our "baby" back.  Many wouldn't understand that - it's only an animal, blah, blah, blah.  Our animals are our children, they're part of the family and, me personally­, will do anything for my family.  They give me more love and support than any human relative has given me so........­.......end of (my) story.  I hope this little guy is found and the fact the owner is willing to pay such a high amount is proof he wants his baby back.

I suppose if you beat your dog he won't forgive you, but it's not unusual to believe in a dog's unconditio­nal love.

You know what?  Based on your post, you come off as rather unseemly in your angry rhetoric towards someone you don't even know.  Maybe you're the one who needs therapy.

				I'm glad my dogs can't read.  They would be shocked & devastated to learn that they are not human!  Then again, maybe they actually think I am a dog.  I only know they make my life so much better for being in it.  I'm glad they are mutts and/or rescues & there wouldn't be much incentive for anyone to steal them.  I hope they get their pet back.  No one deserves that kind of sorrow, rich or poor.

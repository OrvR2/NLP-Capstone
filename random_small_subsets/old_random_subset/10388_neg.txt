The Firesafe program provides low-cost wildland and structural protective clothing to rural and small community fire departments. TFS purchases protective clothing in volume in order to pass along bulk-purchasing savings. The gear is then sold to fire departments, which benefit from the savings. Through this program eligible fire departments can get quality protective clothing at savings of 30 to 40 percent. In 2005, the Firesafe Program processed more than $1.05 million in protective clothing and gear.Wildland fire equipment, including personal protective equipment, hose, nozzles and other water handling accessories, is also included in the Firesafe program. Please note that this equipment is designed for wildland fires and should not be used on other types of fires, such as structure or industrial fires.Payment can be made with a check, money order, or purchase order.

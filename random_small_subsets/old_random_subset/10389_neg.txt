FIRE QUENCH









[ Print | 

 ]



The Fire Quench program offers fire departments an additional tool to assist them in fighting fires. Fire Quench is produced by Texas Correctional Industries located in Sugarland, Texas. It is then transported to the main TFS distribution facility in Lufkin and sent across the state to designated TFS offices for distribution to local departments.Fire Quench is a liquid concentrate composed of a mixture of anionic surfactants, foam stabilizers, inhibitors and solvents. It is a Class A foam concentrate that can be applied to water by batch mixing or using a proportioning system. Fire Quench is sold in 55 gallon drums and five gallon buckets. Surfactants reduce the surface tension of water. Reducing surface tension allows water to penetrate more deeply into fuels which aid in extinguishing the seat of a fire. Reducing the surface tension of water also permits it to spread over a larger area than the same volume of plain water. Additionally, heat is more readily absorbed which helps to slow down and stop the combustion process. In short, surfactants are used to make plain water work more efficiently for fire suppression.

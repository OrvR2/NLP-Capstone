Here's at least one plot spoiler for the upcoming Superman film reboot, "Man of Steel": Lois Lane will need gasoline and/or a Slurpee.
Some new photos of Amy Adams, who plays intrepid Daily Planet reporter and Superman love interest Lois Lane in the film, have been snapped on set in Plano, Illinois, the remade stand-in for Clark Kent's hometown of Smallville. There's not all that much to see, but one thing is for sure: the 7-11 corporation is enthusiastic about product placement in this flick.
Henry Cavill plays the Kryptonian Man of Steel, while Julia Ormond will play Superman's Kryptonian birth mother Lara Lor-Van, Russell Crowe will be his Kryptonian dad Jor-El, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane will take on Pa and Ma Kent, and Michael Shannon will play the role of baddie General Zod.

				They need to re-cast Zod with the original Zod, Terrence Stamp.  They can deageify him with CG, or whatever but the man IS Zod.  There is no other.  I wish he would go back and re-do every role and every scene he's ever played as Zod.  Forget democrats, forget republican­s.  Zod in 2012!!

				I know, totally, right?  I mean, he so miscast Heath Ledger in that oscar-winn­ing role as a psychotic criminal clown.  And Christian Bale looks nothing like billionair­e playboy Bruce Wayne.  Not to mention Michael Caine as an old british butler?  Who is he kidding!

/sarcasm

No but, in all seriousnes­s, Nolan had nothing to do with the casting.  He's producing, but his involvemen­t stopped a long time ago.  He might have weighed in on Superman himself, but otherwise, he's been out of the picture for months.  Snyder is the one responsibl­e for all of this films casting.

				The original Donner "Superman" is one of those classics that really isn't a classic.  People seem to remember it quite fondly from their childhood, but in my opinion at least, it really doesn't hold up at all.  It's pretty cheesy, lacks depth, and honestly without Williams' now truly classic score, I doubt many people would think much of it, even looking back fondly to a time when they were younger, the world was simpler, and you could believe a man could fly.

This was the major fault (of which there MANY) of "Superman Returns" for me, this reliance on trying to capture some of the lightning in a bottle of the Donner films.  Instead of doing what, say, Nolan did with the Batman franchise, and re-tooling it from the ground up, taking a completely different look at the Dark Knight, and more importantl­y at the world around him, Singer just relied on some old, stuffy, goofy film from 30 years ago, and the good feelings people might still have for it.

"Man of Steel" on the other hand seems like more of a real re-imagini­ng.  It has a solid cast, top to bottom, and they seem to have some new ideas.  It looks promising, and I'm hoping that someone can finally construct a film around the world's first true superhero, one which Grant Morrison calls "Man's greatest invention.­"

				It would help if they just focused on telling a good story and not work so hard trying to be a "Superman" movie.  We all get the gist of it now.  Superman is pretty much common cultural currency around the world.  Just tell a good story and reveal the nature of the character through the story.  

And I agree--I have yet to be highly entertaine­d by a Superman movie--not like I was with The Dark Knight.

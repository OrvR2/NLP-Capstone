I really don't care what the haters think about Vibrams.  After running (w/heel-striking) for over ten years, I was having knee and back pain fairly consistently.  Since I began running in Vibrams in July 2010, that pain has gone away and I'm running much longer distances than I used to.  I'm sure they're not for everybody, but speaking solely for myself, they've been fantastic and I'm never going back to regular running shoes.

the bikila's he was wearing were too big for his feet.  Also I wear Vibram Bikila's every single day, they help support multiple muscle groups and they have also helped with my back problems.  I will wear these FOREVER!

I love five finger shoes, I use them to lift, run, and do plyometrics, I have had three knee reconstructions and these are the first shoes to not hurt my knees as I run.

I wear my Vibrams to work out, run & everyday use. People talking about the negatives on hear have never wore them, worked out in them or talked with real people who have. Try going bare foot on a trail or over rocks. They do wake up muscles that nevr get used. Try making a snow ball with mittens on, our toes were meant to be strong also. Just saying..walk a mile in our shoes before ridicule.

I paid $13 for my shoes and they give me better comfort and support than an expensive fad brand.  Those shoes that sell for $50-$200 are all marketing gimmicks aimed at getting idiot shoppers to shell out money for something that cost next to nothing to make in China.

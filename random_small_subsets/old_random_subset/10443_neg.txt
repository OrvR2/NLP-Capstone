ADOPT-A-CLUSTER PROGRAM









[ Print | 

 ]



The Texas Forest has started a new program on the W. G. Jones State Forest south of Conroe that may be of interest to some Boy Scout troops or other groups. The Adopt-a-Cluster program gives scouts and other interested people an opportunity to learn about an endangered species while actively helping to improve the habitat of the species.
The red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW), an endangered species, lives in mature pine forests here in East Texas and across the South to the East Coast. It makes its nesting and roosting cavities in live pine trees. An area that contains these cavity trees and surrounding trees is called a cluster. RCWs prefer their cluster area to be open and park-like, not crowded with mid-story trees and tall brush.
Work that groups could do within these cluster sites would entail clearing mid-story trees and brush next to the cavity trees and within the cluster area, marking cluster boundaries with flagging, and possibly other activities approved by the RCW biologist. Occasional visits to the adopted cluster sites to maintain these sites would be a part of the program. This type of work will benefit the red-cockaded woodpeckers by making the habitat suitable for them to live and raise young.
If you would like more information on the Adopt-a-Cluster program, please contact John Ross, District Forester, Texas Forest Service, at (936) 273-2261 in Conroe, orDonna Work, RCW Coordinator, Texas Forest Service, at (936) 639-8180 or dwork@tfs.tamu.edu.

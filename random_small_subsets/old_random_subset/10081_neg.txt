A new video game is giving players a chance to explore a post-apocalyptic Fox News studio and kill off zombies that resemble famous conservatives including Michele Bachmann, Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck.
The game, called "Tea Party Zombies Must Die," is project by StarvingEyes Advergaming, a website that provides games for online viral campaigns.
Other characters in the first-person shooter include the "Generic Pissed Off Old White Guy Zombie," the "Pissed Off Stupid White Trash Redneck Birther Zombie" and the "Express Racist Views Anonymously On The Internet Modern Klan Zombie," who dons the remains of a KKK robe as he wanders around with a sign that describes President Barack Obama as a Muslim
You can see some of the characters in the game in this video from MRC TV:


According to National Review Online, players get "informative tidbits" between levels about how Obama's health care plan lowers the deficit, and "how most Republicans think the president is a Muslim."
Jason Oda, the head of StarvingEyes, told MRC TV the game was a personal project and downplayed the criticism coming from conservative circles.
"I am not worried about it affecting business," Oda said.

				Conservati­ves should be proud. This game was developed by liberals who are embracing right-wing ideals:

Support for guns and the use of force to solve problems
Capitalism (I'm sure they intend to make money off the game, or at least from the attention it generates for their company)
Strong work ethic (they got off their butts and took their future in their own hands - no waiting for government handouts here)

				Remember the tea party said it was free speech when Sarah Palin put a Gabrielle Giffords in the crosshairs on her website.  They said it was free speech when Sharon Angle started talking about "second amendment remedies" if she lost the election.  The game is distastefu­l but the hypocrisy of the right wing is telling.

				Grow up it is a game that most of us would like to play. It is not the fault of the manufactur­es but yet the blame lies with the pathetic radical stand that is so Antiu American that the Tea Party stands for. They hate America and want to rewtite history and the future. We are a progessive country and that will never change. The Tea Party will have its say and then go off with it'sher) tail between her/ his legs.

				I played the game tonight, it was an okay 1st person shooter game except for all that drivel in between the levels.  I was expecting to see a more representa­tive mixture of TEA Party members such as the hispanics and blacks, seeing that those races also go to the TEA Party rallies and even have their own TEA Party groups around the country.  I cannot wait for the right wing to come out with their own version with the cast of MSNBC, Soros, the soci@list union leaders, and some liberal politician­s, they too can leave out the drivel in between the levels.

				Since we are on the topic of games this is very interestin­g about Gibson guitars. It seems as if the feds had raided their factories and seized their wood......­.http://dig­italjourna­l.com/arti­cle/310962­.........no­te that other companies use the same wood. In an interview with the owner it has come out the he is a Republican and has donated to the Republican party. His work force is non-union. The other guitar makers are Democrats and have a union work force.. Maybe just a lillte strong arming from Holder and the unions here? Please do not make any stupid replies if you do not read the article. Of course I know that there will be a lot of libs that will not read it and reply anyway.

				Gibson's owner is strictly small fry. The company simply isn't important enough for the administra­tion to be worried about to the degree that your paranoid conspiracy theories would indicate. It's more likely that they're acting in response to a complaint from someone high in the Madagascar government­. That does raise some questions, but not the ones that you're promoting.

				I don't see much difference between this than when Palin posted her map with rifle targets on liberals.  Unfortunat­ely one of her targets was actually shot.  Not much was said by the right when she did that.  If you don't like the game don't play it.  I don't intend to.

				Here's the huge difference­s.  1.  Sarah Palin had a target located on states in which voters were to focus efforts to oust liberals.  It was not a target on someone's face or name, let alone an interactiv­e game where you killed someone.  2.  Sarah Palin NEVER talked about targeting liberal CITIZENS!  Let's remember that the Tea Party is a movement of average, unpaid, citizens who are NOT political figures.  Why should they be targeted for violence??  They are not violent, there is no evidence anywhere that tea partiers have injured people anywhere.  However, there is plenty of video out there of union mobsters pushing, punching, and biting US citizens who are exercising their right to free speech.  THAT'S the difference­.

				You realize that if this was going t'other way 'round there would be a huge outcry about violence and death and all sorts of liberal crap.But I guess it is all good this way, right?   Because killing fake people--an­d possibly the real people they represent-­-is all cools when the targets are right.I am not the first person to point out this terrible liberal inconsiste­ncy, but does need to be stated again.

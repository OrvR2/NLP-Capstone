WASHINGTON -- Members of Congress spent August listening to constituents describe their economic struggles. This week, the lawmakers return to Washington to see whether there's enough bipartisanship left to make things better.
Republicans and Democrats agree that job creation is the first priority, but there's little indication so far that the two sides will come together.
President Barack Obama, who will address a joint session of Congress on Thursday, challenged Republicans in a Labor Day speech to put country ahead of party and work with Democrats on a jobs package. He said more than 1 million unemployed construction workers are ready to rebuild deteriorating roads and bridges.
Majority Republicans in the House, however, have been unwilling to spend money on new construction projects – a strong signal that they'll give Obama's address a cool reception.
Besides spending on public works, Obama said he wants pending trade deals passed to open new markets for U.S. goods. He also said he wants Republicans to prove they'll fight as hard to cut taxes for the middle class as they do for profitable oil companies and the wealthiest Americans.
The president is expected to call for continuing a payroll tax cut for workers and jobless benefits for the unemployed. Some Republicans oppose extending the payroll tax cut, calling it an unproven job creator that will only add to the nation's massive debt. The tax cut extension is set to expire Jan. 1.
Republicans may go along with tax break proposals but won't be friendly to ideas to extend jobless benefits. They also cite huge federal budget deficits in expressing opposition to vast new spending on jobs programs.
House Republicans have prepared an autumn jobs agenda that centers on repealing what they say are job-destroying environmental and labor regulations. The first bill, slated for the week of Sept. 12, would prevent the National Labor Relations Board from restricting where an employer can locate in the United States. It grows out of a complaint issued by the NLRB that Boeing Co. was punishing union workers with plans to transfer an assembly line from Washington state to South Carolina.
The anti-regulation bills are likely to hit a dead end in the Democratic-controlled Senate. But the threat of them prompted Obama last week to scrap tougher Environmental Protection Agency regulations on ozone, a key ingredient of smog that causes asthma and other lung illnesses.
While talking jobs, lawmakers will have one eye on the initial meetings of the supercommittee established under legislation enacted in early August to increase the federal debt ceiling. The bipartisan committee has until Nov. 23 to come up with at least $1.2 trillion in deficit cuts. If it fails to do so or if Congress fails to approve its recommendations by Christmas, automatic spending cuts covering both defense and domestic programs would be triggered starting in 2013.
More immediately, Congress must stop itself from actually causing unemployment. Obama, in his address, is expected to urge lawmakers to act swiftly to renew aviation and surface transportation programs and avoid shutdowns that he said could put 1 million jobs at risk.
The Federal Aviation Administration has been operating on short-term extensions since 2007 because the House and Senate can't agree on a comprehensive plan for the future. Earlier this year, the FAA had to shut down for two weeks, resulting in tens of thousands of construction worker layoffs and $400 million in uncollected airline ticket taxes. The agency will shut down again on Sept. 16 unless Congress acts.
Similarly, the law that authorizes federal spending for highway and mass transit programs expires Sept. 30. A stalemate there could disrupt collection of the 18.4 cent-a-gallon federal gasoline tax and have a far more devastating effect on construction jobs.
Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., who is chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said at the end of August that he would agree to one more short-term extension, the eighth, as he negotiates with the Senate on a long-term bill. Mica has proposed a six-year, $230 billion bill financed entirely by gasoline and diesel taxes. The Senate is calling for a two-year, $109 billion bill that would rely on $12 billion appropriated by Congress in addition to the fuel tax revenues.
Not all is negative on the congressional job front.
On its first day back Tuesday, the Senate will vote to move forward on the most extensive revamping of the patent system in six decades. Senate passage of the measure, already approved by the House, would send it to Obama, who agrees with most members of Congress that the legislation will make it easier for inventors to get their products to market and thus encourage hiring.
There's also some optimism that Congress will soon sign off on free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama that have been in limbo since the George W. Bush administration.
Before the August break, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said they had agreed on a path forward for renewing a program that helps workers affected by foreign competition and passing the trade bills, and House Speaker John Boehner also promised a vote on the worker aid bill which Obama says must be linked to the trade agreements.
The administration and supporters of the trade bills say they will generate tens of thousands of jobs. Some labor unions and other skeptics of free trade dispute that conclusion.
Also looming is the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year, when Congress is supposed to have completed the 12 appropriation bills to fund federal agencies for 2012.  So far the House has passed only half of those bills, and the Senate only one, and as in past years they will have to agree on temporary stopgap extensions to avoid a partial government shutdown.
Things are a little easier this year because the debt and budget pact sets the overall total for the 12 bills at $1.043 trillion, a $7 billion cut from current levels. Still, there will be heated debate as Democrats seek to restore cuts planned by Republicans to education, environment, foreign aid and other programs.
One such debate will be over funding the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has less than $800 million in its disaster fund as it faces the Hurricane Irene recovery operation.

 Americans. Edward Wolff, the economist we draw upon the most in this document, concludes that there has been an "astoundin­g" 36.1% drop in the wealth (marketabl­e assets) of the median household since the peak of the housing bubble in 2007. By contrast, the wealth of the top 1% of households dropped by far less: just 11.1%. So as of April 2010, it looks like the wealth distributi­on is even more unequal than it was in 2007. \In the United States, wealth is highly concentrat­ed in a relatively few hands. As of 2007, the top 1% of households (the upper class) owned 34.6% of all privately held wealth, and the next 19% (the managerial­, profession­al, and small business stratum) had 50.5%, which means that just 20% of the people owned a remarkable 85%, leaving only 15% of the wealth for the bottom 80% (wage and salary workers). In terms of financial wealth (total net worth minus the value of one's home), the top 1% of households had an even greater share: 42.7%. Table 1 and Figure 1 present further details drawn from the careful work of economist Edward N. Wolff at New York University (2010)In terms of types of financial wealth, the top one percent of households have 38.3% of all privately held stock, 60.6% of financial securities­, and 62.4% of business equity. The top 10% have 80% to 90% of stocks, bonds, trust funds, and business equity, and over 75% of non-home real estate. Since financial wealth is what counts as far as the control of income-pro­ducing assets, we can say that just 10% of the people own the United States of America.http://soc­iology.ucs­c.edu/whor­ulesameric­a/power/we­alth.html

				"Obama, who agrees with most members of Congress that the legislatio­n will make it easier for inventors to get their products to market and thus encourage hiring"

Balderdash­!

The agents of banks, huge multinatio­nals, and China are at it again trying to brain wash America.

"patent reform"

Just because they call it “reform” doesn’t mean it is. 

The patent bill is nothing less than another monumental federal giveaway for banks, huge multinatio­nals, and China and an off shoring job killing nightmare for America. Even the leading patent expert in China has stated the bill will help them steal our inventions­. Who are the supporters of this bill working for??

Patent reform is a fraud on America. This bill will not do what they claim it will. What it will do is help large multinatio­nal corporatio­ns maintain their monopolies by robbing and killing their small entity and startup competitor­s (so it will do exactly what the large multinatio­nals paid for) and with them the jobs they would have created. The bill will make it harder and more expensive for small firms to get and enforce their patents. Without patents we cant get funded. Yet small entities create the lion's share of new jobs.

				He already did that when Healthcare was on the line.  No one cared and Republican­s hated him even more than before.

I don't think that way would do it, now, either.  It's up to the other political party's to do it.

The Obama's duty as President of the USA is not to be partisan.  Few people see it that way, but if it all becomes partisan, then we might give up our Freedoms.  We will be dominated, instead.

When Everyone was mad at the Democrats they said Everyone is mad at the Democrats. What has happened to MSNBC it seems the Republican­s have taken that station over too. The Republican­s do nothing and we have nothing because of them. We don't need cherry pick what the corporatio­n of Comcast wants.

				It's cute that this article doesn't mention that the ONLY reason for the "trade deal" with Panama is that it gives the super-weal­thy & the corporatio­ns access to moving money freely in & out of a country with super-stri­ct banking privacy laws.

				It's going to be difficult, if not impossible­, to not feed the wealthy when the rest of us need some of that food.    

A lot could be changed, but reality exists on it's own and can't be dissed if it helps us all.

				Good question. it is even possible that the Democrats would start acting like Democrats, if the Republican­s were out of the picture. But, then there is that sticky point that 11,000 corporate lobbyists still have their hands outstretch­ed, filled with millions of dollars, for those who give them the legislatio­n they "ask" for.

Gymnastics GSP is nearly as good as fighting GSP By      Maggie Hendricks


Yahoo! Sports continued looking at how elite athletes train by checking in with Georges St- Pierre and his gymnastics training.

Gymnastics have clearly given the welterweight champ a challenge in strength and conditioning. Throughout the workout, he only uses his own body weight, and not any weights. He's showing a different way to get in shape.
Though he isn't likely to challenge Kohei Uchimura or Jonathan Horton in London next summer, he did show off an impressive move that's usually only accomplished by seasoned gymnasts. While on the still rings, St-Pierre drops into the iron cross, a move that requires strength and impeccable body control. It doesn't show if he holds the move long enough to score bonus points, but that he can even try it shows off his insane athleticism.

0 users disliked this comment spartacusnow Thu Sep 08, 2011 10:54 pm PDT Report Abuse Any exercise regime requires the following components: stretching, cardio, weightlifting(various exercises isolating one muscle or using multiple muscle groups, flexibility training(which would include gymnastics); and the most fun part, playing sports.    If you want to be in elite shape you have to combine all four of these components and train at a high level.    I would not strictly concentrate on emphasizing one exercise category because it will affect overall performance.   
Gymnastics is excellent for increasing flexibility but less benefit to increase muscular strength; having said that, there is muscle strength increase in doing gymnastics but you are only using your own bodyweight or part bodyweight.    Another form of exercising that is very good for overall physical fitness is called Fartlek training.    Fartlek training is basically windsprinting or running at high speed at intervals of 40, 60, and 100 yards for only short rests of a few seconds between sprints.    This windsprinting is also combined with very short jogging of 1, 2, and 3 minute spurts so as to not overstress the body.    A Fartlek training session can be done in 30 minutes or less and is proven to increase VO2 max dramatically.

1 users disliked this comment Skip Thu Sep 08, 2011 11:11 am PDT Report Abuse for all the gsp haters that keep saying he's afraid to move up to silvas weight class, i have a bit of news for you:silva has said numerous times that he won't move out of his weight class for a superfight.   i know he fought at 205, and he won every fight, but now he's moved back to 185, and has said that he won't be moving again.   
i wonder why he doesn't move to 205 and stay there.   there's nothing left for him at 185, he's has success at 205, and could find a real challenge against bigger guys.   he should be at 205 anyway as his natural weight is well over 200 anyway.   i'm not bashing silva because i like both him and gsp.   i just thought it should be noted somewhere that gsp has said he would move up if given the time to put on the weight he needs, and silva has said that he won't move up or down anymore.   call it dodging if you want, but pay attention to who's ducking who

1 users disliked this comment Occam's Razor Overdri ... Thu Sep 08, 2011 09:53 am PDT Report Abuse Best all around 'Mixed Martial Artist' the UFC has ever produced. Silva is on the same level but when the fight happens GSP will get the win, I doubt either will end the fight with a knock out.   
The only GSP haters are @#$% overweight American armchair athletes. 'Most' American fans do not now, nor ever have known the meaning of being a real athlete or sportsmanship. American fighters usually have big mouths with nothing to back it up and then their mouths get bigger when they whine and cry and make excuses as to why they got their @#$% kicked. (ie: BJ Penn, Frank Mir.)   

GSP is MMA.

MMA isnt WWE wrestling where there is a huge finisher every time with a knockout and a clear winner. GSP controls fights and wins because no one can take him down or beat him standing up
he is the champ for a reason

GSP vs Silva is a fight ppl wanna see but its not gonna be anything spectacular. Silva is gonna eat GSP alive coz of his weight, height and reach.

1 users disliked this comment SQ Wed Sep 07, 2011 07:17 pm PDT Report Abuse I know I'll get a lot of thumbs down for this but last time I checked I don't give a @#$%.   

I have met both GSP and Anderson Silva. Both amazing and friendly people just unbelievably friendly. Here's a few facts you might not know which I found out after I talked to them.

All fighters should be about 20 lbs over the weight class in which they fight. GSP is 190 lbs and cuts 15 lbs of water weight to make his WW class. Silva is 220 lbs and cuts 35 lbs of water weight to make his MW class. Insane to say the least. They go back to their natural weight the day of the fight. 30 lbs of real weight difference between the two. In fight world that's day and night. Wait for GSP to gain some real weight and then we can have the mega fight until then just @#$%.   

BTW, as you can see by the numbers I gave you (check for yourself) that GSP actually fights in the weight division he is suppose to where as Silva is fighting in a smaller division. Silva should be fighting in 205 lbs which makes sense cause he is between 220 and 230 lbs. His incredible weight cutting ability is the reason he is as amazing as he looks. Silva is no doubt has out of this world skills but he is fighting against kids and not men his size.

6 users disliked this comment Sno Globe Wed Sep 07, 2011 07:00 pm PDT Report Abuse GSP is cautious because he seems to be afraid to lose.   I know he doesn't care what people think about how he fights, but unless he challenges himself and his opponents more, he will start to lose fans and attention.   His draws will fall and so will his legacy.

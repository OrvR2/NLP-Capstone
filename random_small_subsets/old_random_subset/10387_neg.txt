HELPING HANDS

Created by the 75th Texas Legislature (HB 680) the Helping Hands Program provides liability relief to industry, business, cities and others to donate surplus fire and emergency equipment to Texas Forest Service. Donated equipment can then be distributed by Texas Forest Service to fire departments around the state. Prior to passage of House Bill 680 companies routinely destroyed surplus fire equipment because they could not afford the liability exposure involved with anyone continuing to use these items. Pressure bottles for breathing apparatus were cut in half and regulators buried. Protective gear and hose were cut apart and fire trucks were dismantled and sold for scrap. Most of this equipment had many years of good use left in it. The risk of litigation for those wanting to make donations to volunteer fire departments was just too great.Now, departments who are interested in requesting equipment through this program should submit an Application for Rural Fire Defense Assistance to the Rural Fire Defense Section of the Texas Forest Service - Fire Control Department. Requests will be filled as equipment becomes available. All equipment assigned will become the property of the volunteer fire department.The legislation requires all SCBAs be certified by the Texas Forest Service. There will be a small certification fee for each SCBA assigned and a limit of four SCBAs provided per application. There are no other charges associated with this program. Departments will be contacted to arrange payment of these certification fees as their specific requests are approved.For additional information, please contact John Rush at (936) 639-8100 or email at jrush@tfs.tamu.eduHelping Hands FormDonor Letter of Instructions FormHB-680Since 1997, the Helping Hands Program has received more than $18.5 million in donated equipment, including 171 vehicles and 3,848 breathing apparatus.

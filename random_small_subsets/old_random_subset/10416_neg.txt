TREE COOKIES

What is a Tree Cookie?
Basically, a tree cookie is a cross-section of a tree. The purpose of a tree cookie is to educate people on how to age a tree, how to determine what might have affected the growth of a tree, and recognizing the different parts of a tree.
Determining a Tree's Age
Determining a tree's age using a tree cookie is simple. You just count the dark rings from the center of the cross-section to the bark. However, foresters need to know the age of trees in order to properly manage a forest. Since you cannot tell how old a tree is simply by looking at it, foresters must use a tool called an increment borer. An increment borer takes a core sample so that the rings can be counted. Taking a core sample does not injure the tree. Once the sample is taken, it is put back in the tree and the tree fills in the area with sap.
Tree Growth
Factors which influence the rate of tree growth include sunlight, water, nutrients, location and space. A wide growth ring may indicate that the tree had a year with optimum conditions. A narrow growth ring may indicate a drought, overcrowding from other trees, or competition with other trees for nutrients and sunlight.
Classroom Activities
Project Learning Tree's "Tree Cookies", "Every Tree for Itself", and "Tree Factory" are great classroom activities correlated to the Texas Essential Knowledge Skills (TEKS) which help further explain tree cookies to your students.

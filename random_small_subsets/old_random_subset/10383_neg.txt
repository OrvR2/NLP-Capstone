 ]



Texas Forest Service has the authority to acquire excess military vehicles and equipment and assign the equipment to rural fire departments. Departments are responsible for the care and maintenance of all assigned property. The federal government maintains title to this property and therefore the equipment is considered on loan to the receiving fire department. Only equipment that can be used for fire suppression activities is available through the FEPP program. Texas Forest Service will license FEPP vehicles for participating fire departments. Currently there are 1,846 FEPP vehicles assigned to Texas fire departments.Steps for acquiring FEPP equipmentResponsibilities of the fire departmentTypes of equipment availableFEPP Compliance Standards Briefing Paper

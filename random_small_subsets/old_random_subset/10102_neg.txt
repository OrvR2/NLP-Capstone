With their upcoming B-style action drama "Drive," winning raves from critics and set to wow American audiences this month, Nicolas Winding Refn is already looking to re-team with Carey Mulligan on another film.
This one, however, will be a bit different from the quiet, smoldering and suspenseful "Drive."
"I've always wanted to make a movie with lots of sex. So I wrote this story called, I Walk With The Dead and it takes place in Miami and it's just going to have a lot of sex in it," he told The Playlist back in 2009. Now, he's got his star.
Refn, a Danish filmmaker, is quite quotable, and he told The Hollywood Reporter that he wants to Mulligan to feature as the lead.
It would be a departure for Mulligan, though her breakout film was "An Education," in which she falls in love with a much older man. She's now filming "The Great Gatsby," in which she plays Daisy. She did just feature in "Shame," a film about a sex addict (played by Michael Fassbender), but she was playing his sister, not any of his lovers.
Refn will be teaming with another "Drive" cast member, Ryan Gosling, for his next film, "Only God Forgives," and may team up on a remake of "Logan's Run," too.

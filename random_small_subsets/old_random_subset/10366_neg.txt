All Hazard Response

In addition to the firefighting mandate, TFS is routinely called upon under the State Emergency Management Plan to assist during all-hazard emergencies such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, oil spills and domestic situations that need to be managed by an incident command staff. The incident command system provides a means to coordinate and manage personnel, equipment, facilities and communications to effectively accomplish emergency response operational requirements at incident sites.TFS maintains a workforce of highly trained and experienced personnel. To supplement resources, TFS also works with other responding agencies at the state level to increase the effectiveness of state response through shared training and common communications. Additionally, federal and out-of-state resources and cooperators are often called upon through the National Wildfire Coordinating Group to share resources nationwide.

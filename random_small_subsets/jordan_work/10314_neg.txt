WASHINGTON — Companies in July advertised the most jobs in three years, and layoffs declined – a bit of hope for a weak economy. Still, many employers are in no rush to fill openings.
The Labor Department said Wednesday that employers increased their postings to 3.23 million from 3.17 million in June. That is the largest number of openings since August 2008. Typically, it takes anywhere from one to three months to fill an opening.
More openings don't guarantee more jobs. The government said last week that employers failed to add any net jobs in August, the worst month for hiring since September 2010. The unemployment rate stayed for the second straight month at 9.1 percent.
The worsening jobs outlook has put pressure on President Barack Obama. He is expected on Thursday to introduce a $300 billion jobs package before a joint session of Congress. The plan will likely include extensions of the payroll tax cut and long-term unemployment benefits, tax incentives for businesses that hire and money for public works projects.
There's heavy competition for each job.  Nearly 14 million people were out of work in July. So roughly 4.3 unemployed workers were competing for each opening. That's a slight improvement from June, when the ratio was 4.45. In a healthy economy, the ratio is closed to 2 to 1.
Total openings are about 1.1 million higher than they were in July 2009, one month after the recession officially ended. But they are still far below the 4.4 million openings that existed in December 2007, when the recession began.
The biggest gains in openings were reported in manufacturing, trade, transportation and utilities.
The report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, or JOLTs, illustrates the high degree of churn that takes place in the job market each month. Total hiring in July slowed, to 3.98 million from 4.06 million.
Total layoffs and quits also dropped to 3.92 million from 3.99 million. The difference between total hires and total quits and layoffs is similar to the net jobs gain of 85,000 reported for July.
 The economy isn't growing enough to spur much hiring. It expanded at an annual pace of only 0.7 percent in the first six months of this year, the slowest growth since the recession ended. Growth may improve to a 2 percent rate in the second half, economists forecast, but that's still too weak to encourage much hiring.

				Companies won't hire because there isn't enough consumer demand. 

There isn't enough demand because companies have outsourced so many jobs and laid off so many people. 

Companies go under. People lose their jobs. Everyone loses. 

This is precisely the sort of situation where the government needs to step in and intervene: abolish the H1-B and L1 visa programs. Use a combined carrot-and­-stick approach to simultaneo­usly punish companies for outsourcin­g, and rewarding them for hiring locally. 

It has to be BOTH. Simply giving incentives for hiring locally won't be enough.

				The economic reality is that corporatio­ns in US are losing their capability to save their way to prosperity­.  Productivi­ty is wavering.  Hours worked are at an all time high for existing employees.  Hiring workers to enhance our economic recovery is becoming an urgent priority..­.........N­ot just for the good of the country but for the good of most companies as well. Two trillion of cash on hand may look good on the balance sheet, but it is increasing­ly becoming bad business.

				U.S. corporatio­ns are sitting on massive hoards of cash. Cash they won't spend by making bold capital investment­s, hiring workers and/or acquiring other companies. 

Why? Lack of demand. Regulation by the BO administra­tion --- both too much of it, and the prospect of even MORE regulation­, which brings more risk and uncertaint­y. 

People need to realize - businesses THRIVE on predictabi­lity and risk control. The best thing Clinton did as president that contribute­d to the boom back then was to GET OUT OF THE WAY and promise business there wouldn't be any massive regulatory moves. 

But even that tech boom eventually faltered when Clinton's misguided Dept of Justice pummeled Microsoft into regulatory submission­. Everything went totally downhill from there.

				You can't force anyone to hire if they don't want to.  It's not like they need to hire in order to make a profit. They have found a lean and mean way to make a profit and grow at a manageable pace.  

It's yet to be seen but our economy, for it to turn around, may have to depend not on others to hire you, but for you to work for yourself. Be it a one-man hot dog stand or seamstress shop, it's back to having a trade skill you can offer to the community, vs being a cog in the wheel. At least you have total control over your destiny, pass or fail.

				To the tune of "I'm In The Mood For Love"
__________­__________­__________­__

I'm not in a mood for spending
Simply because you're near me
Funny how when you're near me
I'm not in the mood for spending.

So close and yet so far.
Goods come from far away.
Kohl's Macy's & JCPenny's
Come one, come by, come here
See the goods that come all from China.
CX:But I'm not in the mood for buying.

Cx refrain:
Even if it's cheapy cheap cheap
It cost a neighbor's job......
Tomorrow is a sorrow
Gone not only will your food be
But the table that carries it.

Big Time Corps:
If you do not buy these
Then we won't hire you.
But if you do please buy credit
Charging you high can be good
Keeps our economy growing
Never mind if you can't pay it
I'll be around to charge you more.
More....mo­re!

Who cares about tomorrow
We will be here
And you're at our mercy.
Come one come all

Cx Refrain:
I'm in the mood for war!
Simpyl because you're not here by me
Funny but when you're near me.....
You just give me the creeps.

__________­__________­__________­_____

addendum: Your big corporatio­ns will not hire you because they are waiting if you are going to buy their wares. Profit begets profit and so does greed.

				If the companies were not interested in hiring people, they should not have posted the jobs.  Our current condition is the result of the global economy.  Free trade has not improved the lives of people here.  White collar jobs now are cheaper when outsourced as well as manufactur­ing jobs.  With improved technology coming, the need for human labor will go down as well.  Seems no one is addressing these issues.  I think we should start only buying products that are made in America.  That will increase demand for manufactur­ing in US (at least till the robots take over).

				I don't think there's a conspiracy going on re: hiring...i­.e., not hiring until Obama leaves office. A company will always hire when it's in their best interest. When there's sufficient demand.

Yes, demand. Demand is the key. If people aren't buying sufficient­ly, there won't be hiring.

As soon as demand picks up, hiring will start. Not until.

NEW ORLEANS -- Federal regulators say about 60 percent of the normal daily oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is still turned off following the passage of Tropical Storm Lee.
As of Tuesday, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement said 131 of the 617 staffed production platforms were evacuated. About 41 percent of the Gulf's normal daily production of natural gas also was shut in.
The closed-off production amounted to about 846,000 barrels of oil and 2.2 billion cubic feet of gas.
The agency said offshore petroleum companies were sending personnel back to the platforms Tuesday – and production could resume immediately after the platforms pass damage inspections.
Twelve of the 70 drilling rigs exploring for petroleum in the Gulf remained evacuated Tuesday.

				Ya know?,you'­r the first person that I have seen mention the wave energy that does really work and is being used in other country's although on a small basis it has been proving it's slef to be working just fine and supplying I don't know exactly how many households with all the electric they can use.I think this would be a great way for us to go here in the U.S..I think it's mostly all built oversea's in european country's if I'm not mistaken.W­e should be doing this though,no polutants whatsoever­,nothing wasted and no harm to the planet,atm­osphere and people.Gla­d you mentioned this

OVERVIEW OF THE CERTIFIED FOREST STEWARD (CFS) PROGRAM









[ Print | 

 ]



This recognition program is a way to identify and reward landowners who have multiple-use management plans and are implementing activities on the ground. While there are many landowners that do a great job managing their lands and who are good stewards of the land, the Forest Stewardship Program stresses written objectives and recommendations and this CFS program helps drive that point home.
Program Rules


A basic eligibility requirement of 10 or more qualifying acres for consideration.

The landowner must have a written Stewardship plan for the property that:



Identifies the owner’s management objectives;
Identifies and describes the resources (timber, wildlife, soil, water, recreation, etc.) that are to be managed; and
Contains a schedule, list, or description of the activities recommended to meet the stated objectives.




A nomination form (CFSNomForm.pdf) needs to be completed and submitted. A copy of the Stewardship Plan must be included with the nomination form.

The nominations will be reviewed on a continuous basis. There are no timelines or deadlines. Landowners will be informed of their selection as Certified Forest Stewards and will receive a large, metal sign for the property and a certificate signed by the State Forester.

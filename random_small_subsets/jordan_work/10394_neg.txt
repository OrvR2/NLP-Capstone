Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid SystemThe TIFMAS, or Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid System, is maintained by Texas Forest Service. The program includes training, qualification and mobilization systems to make statewide use of local resources. The program was first used during Hurricane Ike, and has since been used in response to the Presidio flooding, the April 9, 2009, wildfire outbreak in North Texas and Hurricane Alex. The system was successful in all four incidents. Resources mobilized:7 ladder trucks 13 water tenders37 fire engines3 rescue truck368 firefighters11 strike team leaders2 fire inspectors22 ambulances137 paramedicsTIFMAS, a product of Senate Bill 11 enacted in 2007, does not require departments to send resources to incidents. It is a voluntary process.

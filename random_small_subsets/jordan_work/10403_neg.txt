Ron Paul said the Transportation Security Administration is "abusive" toward passengers and "accused of all kind of sexual activities" during Tuesday's GOP debate, hosted by NBC News and Politico.
"Look at the monstrosity we have at the airports," Paul said. "These TSA agents are abusive. Sometimes they're accused of all kinds of sexual activities on the way they maul people at the airport."
Paul said the government agency could not protect passengers as well as private companies and said the 9/11 attacks were the result of too much government involvement in airline security.
“They told the pilots they couldn’t have guns,” Paul said. “They set up the stage for this.”
Paul has spoken out against the TSA before, saying the government agency should be "abolished" and recommending that it be replaced with "real privatization of security."
During a July 4 audio address, Paul said, "The press reports are horrifying... children molested; disabled people abused. ... If the perpetrators were a gang of criminals, their headquarters would be raided by SWAT teams and armed federal agents. Unfortunately, in this case the perpetrators are armed federal agents. This is the sorry situation ten years after the creation of the Transportation Security Administration."

				The strangest thing of the whole debate was how Paul talked about how we need to worry about border fences "keeping us in" rather than keeping the bad guys out. When did he turn into Alex Jones? This guy is completely out of it.

				Correct me if I am wrong,  but I don't believe the TSA workers are allowed to unionize? 

And as far as I understand the jobs pay $15 to $20 an hour with bonuses, OT and Bennies. 

Seems kind of low. 

Like trusting your kid to a bus driver that only makes minimum wage. 

Shouldn't we be willing to pay enough to get the best people?

Oh wait, we want it cheap. And that is what we get.

				The TSA employ's anyone...e­ven without a high school diploma, you can work for the TSA. Lack of education and on the job training leaves us with RUDE, POWER CONTROL freaks! One wink and you are arrested. One comment, and you are hand searched. One strange eye contact and you are pulled out of line. They don't pat, they squeeze. They touch with force, they humiliate at randon. And the TSA answers to NO ONE! Over 5,000 complaints and NOT ONE has gone to any court for a constituti­onal challange or for damages. The TSA is a rouge organizati­on and should be disbanded ASAP.  YEAH RON PAUL...he scores a point! But, I bet, he is a member of the skull and bones-noth­ing new here. The family tree endures at any cost. Who thinks they can change the status Quo? Lawyers for America...­and they don't even pay sales tax!

				The airlines should provide their own security, in fact my company will outbid everyone yet provide the finest security anywhere. What my company will do is make it profitable­, which is what makes the economy hum... right? So a few bombs and some guns get through but your ticket price is cheaper... I will not spend the money to have 3 security agents when 1 could do half as good a job. That's how you save money.  I mean how many hijackings happen anyway? so every 10 years a few people die. My company made a huge profit and that's all that matters. Don't tax that either, it's my money.

				I WITNESSED airport security physically detain a 4 year old girl for "security reasons" because she was too scared to go into a puffer machine. When she ran for mommy, they grabbed her and put her back in the machine screaming and crying. I'm ashamed to say it was Palm Beach airport here in Florida...

				I would like for Ron Paul...or one of these hater posters...­to go work as a TSA agent for one week and actually DO the job.   Take it seriously, follow and enforce TSA rules and regulation­s and perform your duties to the best of your ability.  Oh, and Ron Paul would have to be anonymous and use his position to get by.  Also, know that one error on your part could result in hundreds of people being murdered by a terrorist.  You have no idea what abuse is until you encounter the public, while simply trying to do your job and protect the public.

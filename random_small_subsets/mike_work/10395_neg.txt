Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid SystemThe TIFMAS, or Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid System, is maintained by Texas Forest Service. The program includes training, qualification and mobilization systems to make statewide use of local resources. The program was first used during Hurricane Ike, and has since been used in response to the Presidio flooding, the April 9, 2009, wildfire outbreak in North Texas and Hurricane Alex. The system was successful in all four incidents.

It is a voluntary process.

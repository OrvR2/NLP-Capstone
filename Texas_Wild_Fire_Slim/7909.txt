Calgary man barred from U.S. among many ensnared in post-9-11 border tangleBy Jim Bronskill, The Canadian Press | The Canadian Press – Thu, 8 Sep, 2011

OTTAWA - Hamoud can no longer travel to the United States, and the middle-aged Calgary businessman says he doesn't know why.He's one of many Canadians who now think twice before they head to the U.S. — or can't go there at all — because of post-9-11 security restrictions."The whole thing has just been a nightmare, really," he said in an interview.Hamoud spoke to The Canadian Press on condition his full name not be published out of fear it would only make his travel problems worse.After going to the United States many times over the decades, he and his daughters had to cancel a spring 2010 vacation in New York and Florida because the U.S. Homeland Security Department did not clear him for entry.Five days after returning home from the airport, Hamoud was visited by two Canadian Security Intelligence Service officers who asked lots of questions. But even they couldn't figure out why the U.S. had barred him.He says he's not involved in criminal or extremist activity, and still has no answers from the Americans.Hamoud has missed six business events in the U.S. — no-shows that are taking their toll on his company. He has also had difficulty flying within Canada, as Air Canada consults the U.S. no-fly list even for domestic flights.Hamoud's lawyers have taken up his case with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. But he says there is no guarantee he will be allowed into the U.S."It really demeans an individual."Ihsaan Gardee, executive director of the Canadian Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his group still receives reports from Muslims about difficulty crossing the border."When I speak to members of the community, some of them do express a concern about travelling," he said."They may choose to travel to different destinations as a result of this."The 49th parallel, once known as the world's longest undefended border, is now littered with security-related stumbling blocks.Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart says the long-standing free pass the Americans once granted their polite northern neighbours has been withdrawn as a result of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks."I think that Canada's in a difficult place," she said in an interview."What you're seeing over the decade is the move by the United States to impose the values of border surveillance that it uses (for) the rest of the world increasingly on Canadians."The scrutiny is likely to intensify as Canada pursues a perimeter security pact with the United States. The idea is to beef up continental screening, with the notion that once people and goods have won passage into North America, there will be less need to examine them at the Canada-U.S. border.Opponents say Canada faces an erosion of sovereignty and weaker control over personal information about Canadians by forging such a deal.Some point to the case of Maher Arar, the Ottawa communications engineer who was shipped to Syria and tortured into false terrorism confessions in an abysmal Damascus prison after the RCMP passed inflammatory information about him to the Americans."It's not just the sharing of the information with the U.S. that we're concerned about," Gardee said. "Who is the U.S. sharing this information with?"Stoddart recently told the government that Canadians won't accept weaker protection of their personal details simply to win a perimeter security deal.She says Canadian officials "are extremely mindful" of what's at stake, having consulted her office three times to date on the perimeter issues.But she believes a more laissez-faire approach to privacy south of the border may see the two countries differ on key points, including where a reasonable expectation of privacy exists, what exactly constitutes personal information, and the legal implications of transferring such data to third parties."I would be concerned that we move more towards an American-style model of collecting personal information," Stoddart said."The Americans have fewer checks on sharing information — so that tidbits of our lives from everywhere would be increasingly pulled together in accordance with an American model rather than a Canadian model, which tends to segregate the information for privacy purposes and share only on a 'needs-to-know' basis."One goal of a security deal is an entry-exit database that would track individuals as they arrive in or leave either Canada or the U.S. — information that would be shared between the countries.Such a system could include cross-border flow of biometric data — personal identifiers like fingerprints or iris scans.Stoddart warns such innovations are not a panacea."We know there is no technological system that is failsafe and foolproof. So we are watching this very, very carefully."A recent summary of consultations on the perimeter security proposal carried out by the government says some Canadians were hesitant about sharing more traveller information with the U.S."These concerns centred on the loss of sovereignty, the protection of personal information shared between the two countries, and a general sentiment that not enough was known about the proposed measures."A poll conducted for the privacy commissioner by Harris-Decima found that about four in five Canadians would be at least somewhat concerned if Canada started sharing more information than it currently does with the United States.But since 9-11 the practice has been quietly mushrooming behind the scenes. Consider that:— Millions of Canadians have acquired passports and other secure identification documents in recent years to ensure they can still travel to the United States — spelling an end to the simple verbal declaration of citizenship;— The U.S. Secure Flight program will allow collection of name, gender and birth date from the approximately five million Canadians who fly through American airspace every year en route to destinations such as the Caribbean and Mexico — even though their planes don't touch American soil;— The government admits Canadian air passengers labelled a "high risk" to security have no way of directly challenging confidential profiles the United States compiles about them — even when the files contain data from Canada.A June 2006 audit by Stoddart's office raised concerns about lax controls at the Canada Border Services Agency. "The CBSA cannot, with a reasonable degree of certainty, report either on the extent to which it shares personal information with the United States, or how much and how often it does so."Lorne Lawson, director general of the border agency's risk assessment programs directorate, has met with counterparts in Washington at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to discuss enhanced information sharing.The border agency refused to make Lawson, or any other official, available to discuss the initiatives. Nor would Foreign Affairs, the lead agency on the perimeter security talks, grant an interview about the negotiations.As a result, it's unclear whether — or how — such plans might help unclog the thickening border.All the while, the United States has been adding, not peeling back, the layers.Over the last two years, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has made what it calls "critical security improvements along the northern border," adding inspectors at the ports of entry and Border Patrol agents between ports, as well as refurbishing land crossings.Nearly 3,800 Customs and Border Protection officers scrutinize people and goods at crossings, the department says.The number of Border Patrol agents along the northern parallel has increased 700 per cent since 9-11.And some three dozen land ports of entry are being modernized.Stoddart, whose family has long had a farm in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, remembers something quite different 20 years ago when driving into Vermont with her two young children."They got ice cream cones and I got a newspaper," she recalls. "You would actually cross a field in which cows grazed."At the gate was a sign: Entering U.S. territory, please check in at the nearest border post."That's a good memory, but that's a long time ago and it's not going to come back in the foreseeable future."

Can Canada put together a list of people we don't want in Canada? Like Tea Partiers, American war criminals and maybe Ann Coulter?  How about anyone who calls our healthcare "a stalinist regime full of death panels". From what I've been reading that could be a pretty extensive list! LOL  Like their strict racial guidelines, we could have a little PC check-list to see if they fit our multi-cultural "Canadian Dream" (not Apple Pie, Samosa's...mmmm. Samosa's). It could have questions like "Was Obama born in America" and "Does the Koran tell Muslims to *kill all infidels*?"...I think it's a grand idea.

This is why I'll never travel by air, or travel to the States. Not because I fear flying. But because I fear The Republic of Airport.

As much I hate Muslims I still think that everybody has the right to exercise their
right and freedoms . I feel that Muslims should be treated humanely there is Christian minorities  living in the Muslim world  and they don't get denied or
harassed as much as Muslims get harassed in the west . So You have to look
beyond and understand they are not that bad after all . They are not forcing 
anyone to convert to islam.I think That america consider itself diverse they should
see that this an old business man  doing business  in US whats wrong with that ?
Its all paranoia .  Paranoia breads fear and fear breads security and security too
much of it breads loss of liberty and democracy !  and FEMA camps  , if this
continue like that watch your liberties going down the drain , maybe US soldiers
inside US Attacking and killing americans call it too much security ? 
you be the judge!

I am currently studying in Montreal as an international student from the USA. I respect Canada,its laws and its people. It is a beautiful country and pluralist society just like the USA. USA was attacked on 9/11. Never forget that. I would never speak sacrificially about Canada. It is enervating reading those ignorant comments being vociferated in here. USA is a great country and our economy will remain what it always is; the envy of the world. USA championed the concept of a free society before any other country. yet because of our free society, the terrorists caught us off our guard. We needed to implement new rules and be more diligent in how we protect our homeland. Even after 9/11, America does its best to remain true to the ideals of personal privacy and human rights. We are still a free society. As to the training of security personnel, I do agree that the USA can do better. The guards can be more respectful. They don't just treat Canadians bad, they treat everyone the same. Even Americans returning home. No one is perfect. USA and Canada are two great countries and friends. They both  need to continue working together to further mutual interest and joint security. There is nothing that happens in the USA that cannot happen in Canada as well. Just cooperate and understand the sleepless nights those people spend to give us all this security blanket. And be respectful and treat and talk about others the same way you would want them to talk about you or your country. Normally, I find Canadians to be very polite. So I don't know where all this internet USA bashing is coming from.

The whole issue can be dealt with very quickly if Harper had any balls. I'd make it a treasonist offence to sell hydro or oil based products to the US for a period of 6 months. Trust me when I say, the US would be on their collective hands and knee's begging for a reversal of those policies. The entire mid west as well as the eastern seaboard would be blacked out immediately. And they wouldn't have fuel for their cars or to heat their homes.We kicked their #$%$ once and damn it all we can do it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Buy local, Support Canadian business! They are already in the crapper down there. Believe me, if Canadians didn't spend billions a year down there. They would be paying us to come there - it's not a privilege to go there, they need us, big time.

No problem, just stay in Canada.  I live less than an hour from the border, yet have only bothered to go there 2 times since "9-11".  Both times a pain in the a## at the border.  I am a middle aged caucasion male,  I would hate to see how bad it would be if my name was a "muslem" sounding name.

who wants to go to the US anyway .. the first time I got badmouthed by the american border guards who treat everyone like they are a terrorist was the last time for me.  they are just ridiculous and should have better hiring guidelines before they hire the imbeciles they have.  if you have never been through a border crossing, you would have no idea what they are allowed to do.  open your mouth wrong and you are in jail.  screw the US ... too many other countries to visit who don't harrass you when you want to visit them.  or just keep our $$$ in our own country as we watch them free fall to disaster!

If the U.S. would stop showing the events of 9/11 so much, then maybe there wouldn't be so much hate for any culture. All I see is there throwing more wood on the fire of hate. The government of the U.S. is now starting to act like the KKK in my opinion. Just keep feeding the anger and hate. If you want to remember the people that died on that day, show them instead., Let's remember the faces, not something that makes people angry every time they watch it.

I'm a Canadian citizen and an American citizen living in the US.  I think, honestly, that people on either side of the boarder need to stop considering it a riven right that they can pass between countries.  There are many criminals in America that Canada would not want crossing into their country, and there are many possible threats from Canada, trying to cross into the US.  It happened on 9/11 due to poor intelligence information, a lack of proper structure in the chain of intelligence command, and a lax nature of personal examination at the border.  If it had been the Chateau Frontenaque or the parliment buildings in Ottawa, the downtown core of Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, or any other major city in Canada that had been accacked as NewYork was, you can bet that not only would Canadian officials be tightening US/Canada border security, but they would have asked the US for help doing it.

After living here for 10 years, and growing to understand the need for security when you are one of the worlds largest economies, and a country that had massive ethnic diversity and religious freedoms, I do not understand why Canadians are still so paranoid.  I understand the desire for personal privacy, but you are part of this world.  Canada is part of the earth, not some separate, isolated, sea unto themselves.  It is time to wake up and realize that what affects our world affects us all.  We cannot sit by and ask for privacy and total security at the same time.  Such a thought would be like saying we can cut taxes for small business, give tax breaks to the middle class, and keep all our programs and taxes for everyone else exactly the same.

"He has also had difficulty flying within Canada" ... who's country is it? Theirs ( the U.S.) or ours? Why do we have to follow American rules for our citizens? If he's so bad, then why is he still a Canadian? At this rate, it won't be long before Canada is the 51st state.

It's their country, they can run it how they want to, hell, we let terroists into Canada that crossed their border patrol, so now they're being ultra careful, seriously if what happened in New York happened in your city wouldn't you be extremely careful.  Border crossing is not a right but a privalege in any country.

I condemn 9/11 but I am not going to apologize for something that has nothing to do with me or my religion. 9/11 was orchestrated by Wall street goons.

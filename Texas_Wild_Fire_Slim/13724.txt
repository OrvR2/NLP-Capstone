Rick Perry, meanwhile, resumed his presidential push after rushing home over the weekend to deal with the crisis, traveling to California to meet his Republican rivals in his first nationally televised debate of the campaign.The blaze has left at least two people dead, blackened about 45 square miles around Bastrop and cast a haze over Austin, 25 miles to the west, where the air smelled strongly of pine and cedar.Firefighters reported that the flames were at least 30 percent contained after burning uncontrolled for three days. They credited an easing of the winds from Tropical Storm Lee that had caused the fire to explode over the weekend. Nevertheless, the number of homes that the Texas Forest Service reported destroyed rose from about 600 the previous day.The wildfire is the most catastrophic of more than 170 blazes that have erupted in the past week across the Lone Star State, which is perilously dry because of one of the state's most severe droughts on record. In addition to the two victims in the Bastrop area fire whose bodies were found Tuesday, the outbreak is blamed for two deaths elsewhere.One of the two people killed in the Bastrop area fire was identified AdvertisementWednesday as Michael Farr, 49, who died at his home in Smithville. Bastrop County officials did not immediately release details about the second victim, who they said was found at another location.Mike Fisher, the Bastrop County Emergency Operations Agency's incident commander, said he didn't know if there were any more victims, but "if there are bodies out there, that team is going to find them."Across the state, about 1,200 firefighters battled the blazes, including crews from as far as California and Oregon.The outbreak has made this the state's costliest wildfire season on record.Print

HOW QUICKLY CAN OAK WILT SPREAD?









[ Print |

Because live oaks tend to grow from root spouts and can form root grafts very readily, all or most of the live oaks within a given area share a common root system.  If one tree in a group of live oak trees becomes infected with oak wilt, the pathogen can spread through the common root system at an average rate of about 75 feet per year.  An aerial photograph (below) shows how oak wilt has spread through live oak trees around the house on this ranch.  Trees killed by oak wilt are gray.  The dark green trees are juniper (cedar) and are not impacted by oak wilt.

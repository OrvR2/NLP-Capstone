About
Fandom for Texas Wildfire Relief is the collective effort of Texans in our fandom to bring healing to our families, friends, and neighbors who have lost so much to the terrible string of wildfires that erupted across our state.  Many of us have had to pack up and run from the fires, have returned home to find the flames came frightening close, made frantic phone calls to check on those we love in the affected areas, and continue to watch as the fires burn.
Please help us in our efforts by contributing stories for our compilation, donating to relief agencies, and spreading the word to your readers, authors, and fandom friends.  Every dollar donated to the many organizations providing aid makes an enormous difference in the lives of those affected.
Donations and stories for the compilation are due November 1st, and everyone who contributes with stories, donations, or banners to promote the stories will receive a copy of the compilation.
Thank you!
Texans in the Twilight fandom

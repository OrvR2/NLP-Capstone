One of the primary roles of Predictive Services is the dissemination of information to citizens, local government, state agencies and other stakeholders and cooperators. Tremendous effort has gone into the development of web-based information products that allow local officials and firefighters access fire danger, drought, weather and fire behavior information. Wildfires pose a critical life-safety risk to firefighter and citizens whether state resources are deployed or not. Web-based products and information are one of the primary conduits for making this information available to all. The continued development and advertisement of these products remains a significant priority for all the agency. View more information.

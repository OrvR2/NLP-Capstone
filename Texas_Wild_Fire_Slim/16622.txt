“The One On The Right Is On The Left .”

To heck with it: I’m taking this one back.

Movie of the Week: Shoot ‘Em Up.

Why Shoot ‘Em Up?  Because to quote the classic gamer manual Munchkins Guide to Power Gaming, The Gun Is Your Skill List, that’s why.
Now hush, and wave good-bye to Toy Story 2.

Democrats suppressing GOP visits to Gulf.

(Via Instapundit) It’s the little things that underscore the pettiness that’s infesting the Democratic party’s leadership these days:
Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) wanted to fly 10 lawmakers down to the Gulf of Mexico to see the damage caused by BP’s gigantic oil spill first hand.
House Democrats said no.

#rsrh Moonbat life cycle…

…blackshirt anarchist version (via Hot Air Headlines):

Seriously, look at the guy’s shirt after he finished yelling: this is what all those Rage Against the Machine bandanna-fiends are going to look like in 30 years.  I could be unkind – and somewhat hypocritical – by harping on the fellow’s weight; but, honestly, the man has some decent oratorical presence.  No stammering there at all; a real shame that he’s wasting it on something as puerile as Communism.
Ach, well, if he was smart he wouldn’t be a Commie in the first place.

#rsrh Connecting the Jobs dots.

I know that when the President goes off on things like this:
Obama blasts GOP leader’s ‘ant’ comment as ‘out of touch’
…he wants me to think “Wow.  That Boehner’s really crazy, huh?”  Unfortunately, what I end up actually thinking is “Wow.  Friday’s job report is going to absolutely suck, isn’t it?”  Which it probably will.
In chorus, everyone:
“UNEXPECTEDLY!”
Moe Lane
PS: Goodness knows what the unemployment rate is going to be, mind you.  It’s almost as if they just spin a wheel and sacrifice a pigeon for the number every month.

Malice/Stupidity Watch: Obamaspill edition.

This article by Dick Morris on Alabaman problems with regard to Obamaspill is like Problems With Big Government 120:
According to state disaster relief officials, Alabama conceived a  plan — early on — to erect huge booms offshore to shield the  approximately 200 miles of the state’s coastline from oil. Rather than  install the relatively light and shallow booms in use elsewhere, the  state (with assistance from the Coast Guard) canvassed the world and  located enough huge, heavy booms — some weighing tons and seven meters  high — to guard their coast.
But … no sooner were the booms in place than the Coast Guard, perhaps  under pressure from the public comments of James Carville, uprooted them  and moved them to guard the Louisiana coastline instead.
Or possibly it’s a 090 remedial course.  Because it only gets worse from there. (more…)

Wonder Woman, reimagined.

Slow news day, apparently: this made the New York Times.
Wednesday is a good day for Wonder Woman. This 69-year-old superheroine, published by DC Comics, will don a new — and less revealing — costume and enjoy the publication of Issue No. 600 of her monthly series.
Kind of unkind to mention the age.  As for the re-imagining: I don’t actually care about the ‘less revealing’ aspects of the new costume, but it’s always worrisome when a writer decides to go tap-dancing on continuity…
The costume ties into an alternative history for the character devised by J. Michael Straczynski, the new writer of the series…
Oh, so they have Straczynski writing it?
Never mind that last bit, then.

Odd thing about the Fuller Memorandum.

It would seem that The Fuller Memorandum – which is, of course, the latest volume in the Cthulhu-meets-mathematics-meets-spy-fiction series by Charles Stross – is not supposed to be out until July 6th.  But, of course, that doesn’t mean that the book magically pops into our reality on that date: it has to be printed ahead of time, which means that it has a tangible physical existence.
And that means that it has to be shipped to bookstores before the official publication date.
And sometimes they screw up, and put one copy in the relevant genre section.
And sometimes a person is walking through the relevant genre section in that magic golden hour between somebody screwing up, and somebody noticing the screw-up.  On the off chance that something like this could happen.
And sometimes that person notices the book, grabs it without breaking stride, and heads for the register.
And sometimes that person buys the book, and gets away clean.
Not that I’d know anything about that, of course.

Breitbart: 100K for the Journolist!

I believe that it was Tom Clancy who noted that (back in the Cold War era, at least) the CIA was always prepared to spend real money when purchasing treason.  Apparently, would-be agents simply assumed that the decadent capitalist Western spy agency would offer money as a matter of course, and the CIA didn’t argue with them; it wasn’t as if Communist subjects ever had a really good idea of what the actual market value was for the intelligence that they were selling, and the American public at the time wasn’t really inclined to quibble.  Or even care.  And so we paid, if not top dollar, more than most for useful information.
I mention this because Andrew Breitbart decided to have him some fun:
I’ve had $100,000 burning in my pocket for the last three months and I’d  really like to spend it on a worthy cause.  So how about this: in the  interests of journalistic transparency, and to offer the American public  a unique insight in the workings of the Democrat-Media Complex, I’m  offering $100,000 for the full “JournoList” archive, source fully  protected. Now there’s an offer somebody can’t refuse.
That is, unquestionably, the most diabolically clever thing that I’ve seen all week.  And I’m preemptively including the rest of this week, too: this will be hard to top.

dKos to sue R2000 for bad polls.

Because he can’t sue R2000 for Markos being a dumbass.
Jim Geraghty is too polite to admit that he’s laughing his ass off at the thought that Markos Moulitsas is going to go sue R2000 for  supposedly faking up the polls done for his website.
I’m not. (more…)

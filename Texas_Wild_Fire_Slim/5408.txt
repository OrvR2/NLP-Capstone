As Libyan rebels advance, hundreds seek to flee TripoliBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Fri, Aug 19, 2011

Members of the Said family, who fled the Libyan capital of Tripoli, gather in their living …Libyan rebels continued to make advances on the ground Friday--prompting international officials to offer help in evacuating thousands of foreign migrant workers seeking to leave the capital city of Tripoli, the stronghold for Muammer Gadhafi and his loyalists. As rebel forces have cut off supply channels, the city faces mounting food, fuel and power shortages. In the meantime, U.S. officials have said that Gadhafi is preparing to possibly leave the country with his family, according to an NBC News report that also characterized U.S. officials as increasingly optimistic about developments.
Rebel advances in recent days have cut off a key supply line between Tripoli and  Tunisia, prompting more residents to flee.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) "said an  operation to evacuate thousands of Egyptians and  other foreigners  trapped in Tripoli by the latest fighting would begin  within days,"  MSNBC reported.
"We are looking at all options available, but it  will probably have  to be by sea," IOM spokeswoman Jemini Pandya told  journalists at a press conference in Geneva Friday.
U.S. officials, meanwhile, have said that Gadhafi "is making  preparations for a departure from Libya with his family for possible  exile in Tunisia," the MSNBC report said, adding: "One official suggested it was possible that Gadhafi would leave within days."
In other developments the brother of the Libyan regime spokesman Moussa Ibrahim was killed in a NATO air strike Thursday, news agencies reported.

Rebels are commiting serious crimes " cuting people a live". they are just criminals. for Gaddafi he is inside Tripoli and controling the sitiuation. it is obvious that some libyan dont like Gaddafi but majority is supporting him. in a relegous matter rebels are against Islam rule by putting their hands with NATO

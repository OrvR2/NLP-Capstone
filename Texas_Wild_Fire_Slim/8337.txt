In S.Africa poaching fight, chemical makes rhino horns toxicAFP – 17 hrs ago

A South African game reserve has developed a treatment for rhino horns that is safe for the animals but causes convulsions and headaches to people who consume them, a wildlife group said Wednesday.
The potion is a mixture of drugs used to kill parasites on the rhinos, and includes a dye that turns even finely ground horns neon pink when seen by airport scanners, Rhino and Lion Reserve spokeswoman Lorinda Hern told national news agency SAPA.
"The chemicals have the dual threat of keeping away both natural and human parasites... and last for three to four years," she said.
The treatment has been tested on rhinos at the park outside Johannesburg, she said.
"A permanent solution would be to eliminate the demand for rhino horn altogether," said Hern.
Since the beginning of the year 279 rhinos had been killed for their horns at parks across the country since the beginning of the year, according to the national parks agency.
Last month, the ministry of environmental affairs said it was investigating dehorning rhinos and stopping legal trophy hunts to fight poaching, which has seen the army being deployed to the Kruger National Park.
Poaching has soared from just 13 cases in 2007, an increase powered by demand for rhino horns in Asian traditional medicine.
"Education would go a long way towards teaching consumers that rhino horn contains no nutritional or medicinal value," said Hern.

In South Africa,there are FARMS , owned by whites...they are breeding lions...when the hunters come, they inject them, put them under a tree and say: Look, here we have a  
nice lion ,  that is the nastiest way of making money , I have ever heard of....Game reserves MUST know about this... STOP HUNTING !!! About Rhinos, well, I hope that its true, those chemicals are not hurting the animals.

I love it. The only problem I see with it is that sometimes people give this to their children and I would hate for the innocent kids to be hurt.

Unfortunately, it is very hard to rid ourselves of some traditions. What they really need to do is to get the preists in the asian countries out talking to the people telling them that these things do not work. Rhinos. Elephants, Tigers and all these other animals are so wonderus, they should not be abused like this

Can scientists and conservationists arrange for these ignorant users of Rhino horn to also add something to the horn that would cause their private parts to dry up and fall off as well ?

What a great idea! I really do hope that in the long run the treatment is safe for the rhinos.

Nice idea, but that won't stop them from killing our rhino. Anyway, make it a lethal toxin, maybe if a few of them have a nasty death, they might stop the poaching.

Two Die As Texas Wildfires Destroy Homes





Tweet






			1:40pm UK, Friday September 09, 2011
		

			Two people have died in a wildfire that has spread across Austin, Texas, destroying more than 1,300 homes.
		


The burnt remains of a motorcycle and a vehicle in the remains of where a house once stood. 

 Authorities say the 35,000 acre blaze has wrecked more buildings than any other in the state's history.
More than 3.6 million acres in Texas have been scorched by wildfires since November, fed by a continuing drought that has caused more than $5bn (£3.1bn) in damage to the state's agricultural industry.
Bastrop County, with a population around 75,000, has been badly hit with 5,000 people being evacuated.



A firefighter hoses down a tree


The region has been declared a federal disaster area and officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency have been on the ground since Tuesday assessing the damage.
The footprint of the fire, according to the Texas Forest Service, is a massive 20 by 24 miles, and the flames have turned entire neighbourhoods into blackened moonscapes of burned out vehicles and crusts that used to be homes.
"We had a lovely home, and we had a nice neighbourhood, and it's gone. We just have to accept that," said one resident.



Bastrop area residents listen to government officials


Officials say more than three dozen fires are currently burning across the state, consuming 120,000 acres and driving thousands of people from their homes.
County Judge Ronnie McDonald warned residents not to return to their areas until they were given the all-clear.
"Respect the firefighters," he said. "Let them go in and do their jobs."

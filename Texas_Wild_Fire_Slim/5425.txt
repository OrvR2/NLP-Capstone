A few days ago, we saw Lady Gaga go au naturel for her "You And I" fashion-film series, and we liked her fresh-faced new look.
Now more images from the shoot by Dutch fashion photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin can be seen in Harper's Bazaar's October issue.
In the cover story, Gaga discusses her affinity for designers like Thierry Mugler and Hussein Chalayan and proclaims that without the late Alexander McQueen's creations, "I'd be naked." 
(In her last Bazaar cover story, she revealed that McQueen had been working "through her", which we take to mean... well, we're not really sure what that means ).
Turns out stripping down for the shoot, in which she sports only a skimpy slip, has always come natural. "Even when I was a kid, I used to run around naked with the babysitter, driving her crazy," Gaga reveals to the mag.
And the Lady says she was similarly carefree when she and friends plundered the Versace archive in Milan a few months back:
"We were all running around this warehouse laughing and putting on jackets and shoes. We started crying at one point. I've been dreaming of seeing those outfits my whole life."
Though some of her Versace acquisitions  -- particularly a certain black harness -- proved controversial, we'd be pretty excited to have access to vintage Gianni creations too.

Texas wildfires destroy over 1,000 homes: PerryBy Mohammad Zargham | Reuters – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

Click to see more images of the Texas wildfires.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wildfires sweeping across Texas have destroyed more than 1,000 homes, Governor Rick Perry said on Tuesday.
In an interview with CBS, Perry said he hopes cooler temperatures and slowing winds on Tuesday would help firefighters make headway in containing more than 50 fires across the state.
"There's over a thousand homes now that have been lost by these fires -- over 50 fires -- in the state of Texas," Perry said from the state capital Austin.
"It's still a very critical and very fluid situation," he said.
More than 3.6 million acres (1.5 million hectares) in Texas have been scorched by wildfires since November, fed by a continuing drought that has caused more than $5 billion in damage to the state's agricultural industry and shows no sign of easing any time soon.
The Texas Forest Service responded on Sunday to 63 new fires burning on more than 32,000 acres, including 22 new large fires. Authorities said two people were killed on Sunday.
Officials said the worst of the fires was the Bastrop County Complex fire, east of Austin, which stretched for 16 miles.
Perry, the frontrunner among Republican presidential candidates, canceled his appearance at a candidate roundtable in South Carolina on Monday to return to Austin.
He told CBS he was focused on the firefighting effort and did not know whether he would attend a Republican candidates debate in California on Wednesday.

For every one who is making these derogatory commits about Texas and they are to scared to show your true name and picture, then you are all very incompetent people and scared ! I fear no one I look danger in face every day 24/7 and for the record, it does not matter where you live as long as you are living and are happy rather it be in Texas or any other state, so the commits that are Derogatory shows your mental intelligence, these fires have nothing to do with politics ! who cares about your political views, you have no clue ! so keep your opinions to your self , if you were raised right you would respect others and there lively hood ! and further more if you read about the fires then you will find out it was all started by a piece of coal from a grill ! I am 3 miles from the fires area me & my kids I work here and it is really bad, we are doing it on our own here fighting these fires, so for any one to say any thing negative about Texas remember what you say , because it will come back to haunt you when carma pays you a visit . and don't cry about it you brought it on your self.

Perry also  used, what he would call Obama's stimulus money, to keep Texas from going bankrupt.

i'm surprised perry isn't spending all his time trying to pray for the fires to go out.  what a douche.  why do politicians from texas seem to be such retards?  and this idiot thinks he can be president?

As a Texan these comments further persuade me it may be time to defund FEMA. Not because people should not be helped when disasters strikes, but because it seems too tempting for politicians to use the program to buy friends and punish enemies. Texas has been on fire since April. We have lost 3.5 million acres and endured more than 5 billion in losses. I doubt the president, the media, or liberals would have ignored or celebrated these losses in a blue state.

Texas wildfire is a mix of good and bad news. For the majority, it's bad news. However, for those that have their house on the market for a long time, insurance claims may be better than fire sale.

No decent American begrudges Texas any federal aid for this disaster--if being a nation means anything, it means we look out for each other, especially on things like this.

That said, I am so sick of you nitwits who claim Texans are fighting the fires by themselves. Texas IS getting federal aid--as it should. If it looks like you're doing everything yourselves, it's because your idiot governor decided that, although Texas was already relying on the cheapest possible version of a vital service--volunteer, rather than professional, firefighters--it still wasn't cheap enough and he decided to nickel-and-dime them to death, cutting their funding by 77%. So instead of having resources in place, you lost precious time waiting for ad hoc help from the feds and the rest of the country.

Seriously, I know you've got smart, sensible, hardworking people in Texas. Why on earth did y'all elect this dumbbell?

it doesn't matter what the subject of any news story happens to be, people responding are for the most part hateful and malicious. Yahoo needs remove the reply option.

Did anyone ask Michele Bachmann if the fires were God's way of sending a message to Texas?

Maybe if all of those religious fanatics down there in Texas pray and renounce muslims, the fires will stop.

I understand that many people are frustrated with the Christian conservatives that live in Texas, but this is not the time nor subject to vent those frustrations.  As a Christian, I do not believe God necessarily causes nor prevents disasters like these.  What I do believe is that God is present in the moment and reaches out to touch and support those affected.  

Mocking religion tends to do little but show just how great a need we have for religion in our society. Those of you who are mocking Texas and/or Christianity should ask yourselves if you really want to live in a world filled with people like you when you get in trouble.  If that is the kind of "support" you would hope to receive from your neighbors... then I pity you.  Despite your mockery and hate mongering, those who follow Christ's teachings (and other good folk too!) will try to be there for you when you ask for help. I hope you find comfort in that knowledge and perhaps show a bit of the love and support that others would offer you.

God's peace and love to you all.

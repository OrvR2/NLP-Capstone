Facebook sued by father over 'explicit' photos of 12-year-old daughterBy Andrew Couts | Digital Trends – Tue, Sep 6, 2011





  
A Northern Ireland man has sued Facebook after his 12-year-old daughter was able to post lewd photos of herself to the social network, reports the BBC. The lawsuit has called into question whether Facebook, which officially bars anyone under the age of 13 from becoming a member, does enough to verify the age of its users.
“My own personal view is that Facebook isn’t suitable for under-18s, but the company isn’t even able to uphold its own policy of keeping under-13s out,” said Hilary Carmichael, the father’s lawyer. “An age check, like asking for a passport number, would be a simple measure for Facebook to implement.”
According to Charmichael, the photos in question were “sexually explicit,” and showed the girl “heavily made-up,” and “in a provocative pose,” which made her appear “much older than her 12 years.”
The girl also reportedly posted information about where she lives and which school she attends.
The lawsuit, filed in a Belfast High Court on Monday claims that Facebook was “guilty of negligence.” It also alleges that the Palo Alto, California-based website created “a risk of sexual and physical harm” to the girl.
If the girl’s account is not deleted by Facebook, the lawsuit promises that “an application will be made to stop Facebook operating in Northern Ireland,” according to Charmichael’s website.
Ms. Charmichael has also created another website, called “Children on Facebook,” which seeks to find other concerned parents who believe their children’s rights have been infringed upon by Facebook in the same way.
The case also raises the question: Who is responsible for the well-being of children online, Facebook, the children’s parents, or both?
In 2008, Facebook’s now-former Chief Privacy Officer, Chris Kelly, responded to the New York state attorney general at the time, Andrew Cuomo, (now Governor Cuomo) who said Facebook was “a magnet for those who prey on the young.” Kelly told The Sunday Times of London that both sides must play their part.
“There are multiple layers of responsibility and the core for us is to provide the tools that will be effective at protecting kids,” said Kelly.He added: “One of the things that you have to do is educate kids not to meet anyone that they only know online, and to tell their parents where they’re going and what they’re doing, and have the parents be an active participant in their lives.”
Facebook has not yet responded to this most recent lawsuit.

Most reactions blaming the parents here come from teens who have no idea of how to balance a job and being a parent is difficult nowadays. It used to be only peer bonding that take up the time of what could be family bonding, with the rights of the child being abused as an excuse to play and socialize with their peers through the internet and online gaming, children have virtually no time for family. And if the parents insist, they are accused of being authoritative and being backward minded. Personally, I think children have too many liberties today and not enough personal responsibilities.

Parents should be capable for guiding their children in any aspects,  There are policies to be followed in joining the network, So many peoples has an account in FB , it really helps to communicate to a long lost friends and relatives. The network can't guard millions accounts, it's the parents responsibility for the guidance of their children.

Every child should be taught on how to be responsible and be accountable for all their actions.  It is not the primary job on FB to safeguard everyone's kid's safety.  It is the job of each parents to discipline their kids and guide them to act appropriately.

Blaming FB is like blaming Bill Gates because computer stores information and have it accessed. Users should take the risk. If she posted lewd photos and get raped, she should know that its the risk. Why should the father blame FB, he should blame himself buying computer, digital camera, and making her daughter oriented how to use them.

first it's the responsibility of the parents to guide their children and supervise them.  limit the use of internet, let them use internet only when they need it for research.  and when they use it to play, be sure you are present so you can see what they are doing and interact with your children.

That's just what we need, to give more information to a website, like a passport number! Jeez. Sorry buddy, monitoring your 12 year old child is your responsibility.

Atypical liberal!!!
Blame everyone else for your daughters actions instead of the 2 people who deserve the blame!
HIM & HIS DAUGHTER!!!!
I know alot of people who have kids who have FB accounts but, unlike MYSPACE, there is no way to report an improper & unauthorized account!
Once again we have an idiot liberal parent who knows how to procreate but doesn't know how to be a parent!

It's pretty simple, parental controls on your computers, and watch your kids. Sure they can still make up one at a friends house, they can still find ways to do something, but that's where facebook needs to step in and require a real age/identity check. That helps stop kids from making a separate account that they hide from their parents. But the bottom line is, keep both eyes on your kids. You look away for a second and they're in trouble already.

The main reason for suing " MONEY".. His daughters fault for posting photos of herself , her responsibility. Why take it to the FACEBOOK?

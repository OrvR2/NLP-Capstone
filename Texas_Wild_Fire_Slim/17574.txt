Traditional Media Reporters Fail to Understand the Purpose of Blogging

By murshedz

I promise I will not do a lot of “meta” here on C&L, but I couldn’t help myself after I read something this morning. Apparently the Politico’s Ben Smith is experiencing a little bit of “blog neurosis.” He feels confused on how to navigate through his news chores of both blogging and tweeting as he lamented to AdWeek that Twitter is “sort of draining the life from the blog.” His boss Jim VandeHei seems to feel his pain suggesting blogs many not “thrive as robustly as it did four years ago” because of the rise of Twitter.
Well the thoughts from both Smith and VandeHei seem amusing because they give us a peek of the mindsets of traditional media reporters who never fully appreciated the concept of blogging. It is interesting that these reporters are looking at the 2008 election cycle as the time when blogs really came into prominent. This platform actually came into prominence during progressive netroots emergence following the march to Iraq war. I am sure Amato can share his own thoughts on that.
Moreover, reporters like Smith, VandeHei and their colleagues from traditional media outlets in the DC bubble fundamentally misconstrue the purpose of blogging. I have a newsflash for those guys: blogging is not just about breaking news stories with a provocative headline slapped together with a 2-4 paragraph excerpts and 2-3 sentence superficial takes. It is lot more than that. Blogging can have many different purposes including but not limited:

Aggregating all the news in place to give the readers a sketch of the narrative
 Offering analysis and break-down on micro-angle of a story
 Using it as an organizing platform for community related events
 Using it to lay out a vision/plan – applicable for that community – in the coming months
 Using it as a place to solicit substantive feedback from the community on targeted issues and stories

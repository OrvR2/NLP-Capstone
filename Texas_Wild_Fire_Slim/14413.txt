AUSTIN, Texas -- Wildfire survivors in Gregg County can meet with state and federal specialists at a recovery center opening soon in Longview.
Monday through Wednesday, specialists from the state of Texas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Small Business Administration will be on hand to answer questions and provide information on the types of assistance available to survivors. They also have brochures and other written materials on disaster recovery.

Any Texas survivor who has questions about the recovery process or who needs help registering with FEMA is urged to stop by a center. Visiting with a recovery specialist is not a requirement for survivors who want disaster assistance, but the centers are an excellent way for people to get answers to their questions about disaster aid and help applying for it.

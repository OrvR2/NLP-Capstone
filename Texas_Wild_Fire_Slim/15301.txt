StoryText SizeMore Retailers Expose Shoppers UndressingLocal 6 Investigation Into Fitting Room Privacy WidensSteven Cooper, Consumer Editor/Investigative ReporterPOSTED: Wednesday, September 14, 2011UPDATED: 11:25 pm EDT September 14, 2011 Orlando, Fla. -- The department store dressing room is not as private as many shoppers may think.  You can close the fitting room door, but others can still watch you undress.  A Local 6 investigation into the fitting room design at Macys was just the tip of the iceberg.Our investigation focused on the privacy slats of the dressing room doors.  In the down position, shoppers are guaranteed complete privacy.  In the up position, anyone, not just store security personnel, can watch you undress.We found most doors at Macys with slats up.  Behind those doors, our colleagues undressed, clearly showing that anyone walking by could see them removing their clothes.  After much pressure, Macys acknowledged the problem and resolved to reinstall the doors.We have now widened the investigation to include four more major retailers: Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdales, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Sears.  In each store we found fitting room doors with the slats-up design, fully revealing our colleagues who disrobed inside.At Saks, you can tell even before you enter that when you walk into a fitting room there, strangers can watch you undress; the full fitting room can be viewed from outside the door.  A Local 6 producer disrobed while a male sales clerk waited and watched from outside.We found the fitting rooms at the Florida Mall Sears just as revealing, as another Local 6 producer could be seen in only her bra from the waist up.At Bloomingdales, we recorded video of a colleague in obvious stages of undress.  At Neiman Marcus, the video captured a similar scene of pants dropping to the floor, exposing bare legs and more.We showed our video to several shoppers in Winter Park.I think you're entitled to your privacy, one woman said. I thought they had all of these beeping noises that go off if you take things out of the store. I think there's other ways to do it without invading your privacy.It's really a shame. It's a shame people are doing this and has gone to this extreme, another shopper told Local 6.Local 6 has reached out to all the stores mentioned in this story.  Saks emphatically refused to comment on what it calls a loss prevention policy.  Saks was the only merchant that refused to discuss the investigation.In its statement, Neiman Marcus acknowledged, but defended, its dressing room design.We are confident that we are not violating any laws with regard to our customers' privacy. Our dressing room areas are located off of the selling floor and access is monitored by both our sales associates and our security staff. Being able to observe our dressing rooms is part of the security we provide for our customers in our store, and our observation is not based on any voyeuristic reasons.  We thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention, said company spokesperson Ginger Reeder.The other retailers told Local 6 they were taking immediate action.Sears takes our customers right to privacy very seriously and after an inspection of the dressing rooms at this store we discovered that one door was installed incorrectly, said Kimberly Freely, spokesperson for Sears Holding Corporation.  Our facilities team immediately corrected the error and we have called for additional inspections of fitting rooms within our store organization to ensure that management is responsive to this issue going forward.Bloomingdales also expressed its commitment to customer privacy.Bloomingdale's fitting rooms are designed to give the customer a sense of comfort and an appropriate level of privacy when trying on merchandise. Fitting rooms in our stores across the country vary in size, design and configuration, depending primarily on when each store was built, said Bloomingdales spokesperson Marissa Vitagliano. We currently are implementing changes to some fitting room doors so they are consistent across the company. At the end of this process, our fitting room doors will have outward-facing slats or solid insets that limit the visibility into the fitting from anyone standing outside the room.  We strive to make customers feel safe and secure at Bloomingdale's.State law allows merchants to directly observe customers in fitting rooms.  However, the law does not imply that other shoppers should be able to observe as well.   Previous Stories:  July 28, 2011: Shoppers Exposed While Trying On Clothes

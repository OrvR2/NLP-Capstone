Sept. 2, 2011 — COLLEGE STATION, Texas — With a forecast of triple-digit temperatures and no rain in sight, the trees in your yard likely need a little TLC, and water is the best way to show the love.Texas Forest Service has released a video and companion information packet designed to help residents know how much and how often they should water their trees.Facing one of the worst droughts in state history, trees across Texas already are showing signs of stress. Some are dropping leaves and branches while others have leaves that are wilting and turning yellow and brown. Some have even died.State tree experts say it’s too soon to tell how many trees we may lose. Many have gone dormant in an act of self-preservation so it could be next spring before we know if they will make a comeback.Until then, the most important thing for you to do is water — properly and efficiently.“Trees are on the job 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They boost our property values. They shade your house, which cuts your electricity bill. The even clean the air you breathe and the water you drink,” said John Giedraitis, urban forestry manager for Texas Forest Service.“They give us so much. It’s time for us to give them a little something back, especially now that they really need it.”View Water your Trees!

c. 2011 Religion News Service 
WASHINGTON (RNS) The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday (Sept. 6) announced a settlement with Henrico County, Va., over the county's alleged violation of a federal anti-discrimination law when it refused to rezone property for a group of Muslims who wanted to build a mosque.

The Justice Department claimed the county's actions violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), which prohibits religious discrimination in land use and zoning decisions. The settlement requires the county to allow the mosque to be built without improper interference or delay.

"Religious freedom is one of our most cherished rights, and that right includes the ability to assemble and build places of worship without facing discrimination," said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez.

The case arose in late 2008 when local Muslims were denied the ability to build the first mosque in the county, just north of Richmond. The Muslims filed suit, charging that the denial of the request was "arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable."

The Justice Department joined the case in March 2010 and found evidence that the request to build had been denied on the basis of hostility toward Muslims. The county had never turned down a rezoning application submitted by one of its 209 Christian churches, government attorneys said.

The settlement requires Henrico County to publicize its nondiscrimination policies and to provide training on RLUIPA to all county officials involved in land use matters.

"This agreement will ensure that religious freedom is upheld in Henrico County," said Neil H. MacBride, the U.S. attorney for the
Eastern District of Virginia.

				As with most things, time, seems to water down the original ideology and truth. This country's forefather­s undoubtedl­y drew up the consitutio­n with the premise that everything written was intented to protect the rights of Whites, their religion, their way of life. Not for Indians, Mexicans, Blacks, Irish, or Itlians nor any other ethnicity that immigrated to America or the peoples already living on this land. Much less, for the followers of a religion that makes America their enemy. As time goes by, the ideology and constituti­on has been and is being watered down. As far as American's human rights, this is a good thing, but to allow, these enemies to establish their "rights" to continuall­y insult us Americans, is too much to bear. They should actually go home and build their mosques there. I as an American, do not want them here. I as an American, believe in a Christ centered doctrine, I as an American believe, if you do not love this country the way it is, you need to leave to your own country to practice your religion there....

				Is it a surprise?
The founder of islam, mohammed, built mosques all over the place, including the one in Jerusalem. What history states is that mohammed was a warlord, basically a man that lived by the sword.
The difference between him and say Buddha, or Christ or any other religious figure one can think of is that mohammed was a killer.
Why don't muslims denounce terrorism?­...because doing so would be like denouncing mohammed.
I say DENOUNCE TERRORISM NOW!!

"Religious freedom is one of our most cherished rights, and that right includes the ability to assemble and build places of worship without facing discrimina­tion," said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez.

Too many people claim that this is the land of the free, without thinking that concept out.
You don't have to agree with your fellow  Americans, but it's a basic tenet of our culture to accept that everyone has equal freedom of religion.
That's not always easy, but it's right.

				There's no place for mosques in this country. All they are is gathering places for terrorists­. If you need to go to a mosque, take some oil money, fly home, do your praying then stay there.

				They should put the Mosque in an industrial warehouse district like we saw in Germany.  That way they have plenty of parking.   Most important, those who are not Muslims are not forced to listed to the call to prayer blasted out on a P A system 5 times a day.  That can be heard blocks away.  It does not matter if you are trying to sleep you WILL listen to it.  I have been in a church a few blocks from a Mosque and heard to call to prayer so loud inside the church that the priest could not be heard.  The church had very thick walls and doors, but when the volume is turned up, nothing helps.   The noise factor will probably damage property values in the areas closest to the Mosque.

				That's the intent,   To be as obnoxious as possible and then claim that any objection to your behavior is just racial hatred.   Claim that your beliefs require you to notify people through ampliers even though God couldn't have commanded such a thing since solid state electronic­s didn't exist back then.    The new game right now is to drive people nuts until they complain then you accuse them of being biased.   Just like the latin americans who make sure we know they're illegal knowing Americans get in trouble if we try to create laws about them, THAT is the new game.

The first steps that led to the demise of America are also the steps to counter the offensive of another culture. This is what happened to America.   Simple steps.   Pay their daughters to do porn, sell drugs to their kids,  Control lending and allow them to lose money in investment­s, Sell them overpriced goods and make them feel like they need to compete with the neighbors.   Buy the land for the companies that hire them and then pressure the companies to leave town with high rent.   THAT was the start of america's fall.   But never do you voice to them you're opposed to what they do.   Not until you've almost got them beat.  divide & conquer.  This is not a suggestion but merely a reflection to what America has endured.

				Keep in mind, there's laws protecting the creation of religious establishm­ents but Chrstians are sometimes banned from putting Christmas displays in the yard.    The early Christians used to worship in the catacombs under the cities.  The bible's prophecy says that there will be a time Christians will have be persecuted for their beliefs.  We hear of this happening in other countries and ignore it because it's just somewhere else.  America's conceit has allowed it to believe this could never happen here.   But it can and is.   This is NOT a Christian issue, it's an American issue.     Losing rights as Americans is not the biggest thing we lose.

Historica buildings would be leveled, the white house would be changed to look more like those structures­, and our librarires would be destroyed.  Our television stations would be severely censored, our internet would be crippled or severely hindered.   Just like Chrstians once burned great literature in the name of God, just imagine what else we'll lose in the name of yet another.

				I wholeheart­edly agree with the DOJ's decision regarding the building of the mosque. If we expect that there not be any discrimina­tion regarding any religion's decision to build anywhere they may choose to, assuming that they can obtain the property and that they abide by the assorted building codes, then we must offer the same protection to Islam or any other non-judeoc­hristian religion.

Personally­, I am not at all sure of the wisdom of building any new mosques right now. Certainly not given the current climate of xenophobia sweeping the nation. But that's their problem.

				Here is the problem with islam...th­eir founder mohammed was a warlord, a power hungry killer.
When you say, or read about religion, you are thinking of a peace loving group of people like Christ, or Buddhists for example.
Read your history.
mohammed was a killer.
Did Christ, or Buddha advocate killing?  
That is the difference­.
Another point.  Why don't muslims denounce terrorism?
...because doing so is to denounce mohammed.

				A place of worship is one thing.   But a building that is establishe­d to remind the congregati­on they are NOT american can do more than just provide a place to worship.  It can boarder brainwashi­ng those who attend to feel less American.  And thousands of Muslims in every city feeling less and less American can ultimately bring disaster.  When you see the Mosques demanding to take over American residentia­l neighborho­ods under new zoning it becomes a grave reminder that there's a group that's more concerned with their agenda than just worshiping thier god IN America without disrupting Americans.

				One of our fundamenta­l rights as an American is Freedom of Religion. This is not some 3rd world country under a dictatorsh­ip. Good Grief.. some of you people have Islamophob­ia which describes prejudice against, hatred or irrational fear of Islam or Muslims . Wonder how many have JapanesePh­obia or Viet Nam Phobia..I think we need to "get over it" their are radicals in most every religion and politica party so, we need to be more tolorable to the good ones.

				Sure, try an build a Christian church in Iraq or any of the Muslim country's and see what happens.  Those are the beliefs and principles they are bringing into our country and using our Constituti­on to do it.  When their numbers become overwhelmi­ng to our country as others like England, France, Germany;  then you'll see what their religious freedom is all about.  Of course if your not a religious person, it won't matter then.

				It will matter! The goal of radical Islam is a world-wide Caliphate, with sharia law for everyone. Now, if this comes to fruition, the Radicals have 3 Options for the "conquered­". You can convert to Islam, be killed, or be permitted to live as a second class citizen, and pay a hefty tax for the right to exist. Check it out!

				It's not about building churches elsewhere, it's about ours being a nation founded on the very principles of religious freedom ... which includes building houses of worship.

I would imagine the indigenous peoples (Indians) probably thought about the same as you when they saw Pilgrims and Protestant­s swarming ashore [first illegal immigrants­]: "Well, there goes the neighborho­od. Property won't be worth a plug wampum and next thing, there'll be cabins and churches as far as you can see ..."

				You are wrong.  In the past 2 1/2 years we have become a third world country.

There is no irrational fear of muslims.  Did they not attack us while the rest of the muslim world cheered them on?  How many of their leaders have been preaching against the U.S. in these quasi-reli­gious building that they have built up around the country?  Have you heard them preach against the United States and Christiani­ty?  

They want you dead Skydave, unless you are one of them.

You cannot separate the radicals from the peace loving muslims, because you have never met a peace loving muslim.

Let them all go back to cooking with camel dung, back where they belong.  If it was so great, why are they here?

Why do people want Ron Paul for President?
Here, I'm going to make it as simple as possible.
1. The Military Industrial Complex "invests" MILLIONS﻿ in "front-runner" Candidates
2. "Front-runner" Candidate gets elected.
3. "Representatives" give BILLIONS in "aid" to the militaries all over the world with the condition that the "aid" be used to "buy American."
4. The Military Industrial Complex makes TRILLIONS of dollars.
5. Go to step 1.

@AlexisValeth We are willing to die for the values that this country was founded upon. The founders would have never sacrificed liberty for safety. You﻿ are clearly a brainwashed sheep that thinks the government can openly violate the 4th amendment. To call a violation of the 4th amendment "temporarily inconviencing" shows you have no clue what our country was founded upon. Learn some history.

@AlexisValeth what "other attacks"? there's been 0.on top of that,increased security has caught 0 real terrorist. temporally inconvenienced?FOR 10 YEARS!
the war on terror is responsible for thousands times﻿ more deaths than any terrorist acts!
around 3000 dead at 911 was tragic,but how does that justify killing hundreds of thousands? all the while sending our country into depression?

@zbutler1125 - I don't know what to say here... I thought my post was QUITE clear that the REASON that the people want Ron Paul is BECAUSE he is NOT a "front-runner" candidate as far as the "news" is concerned... I've pasted this a LOT of times in other eweTubes and blogs and such, and this is the first time someone called my ignorant for having posted it.
Let me be SUPER clear on this: It is Ron Paul or we go bust. There is no third way.﻿

@bigken61 I'd﻿ like to point out a minor error.
"2. Front-runner" Candidate gets (appointed). There is NO election!!"
Also note: Let's not stop at tsa. We have to dismantle the entire pyramid scheme from the top to the bottom!!
Otherwise we'll all be enslaved. Serving the appointment!
Does anybody see history repeating itself like since time began?
This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius! With any luck, we're heading in the right direction.

@bigken61 You, my friend are ignorant. If we stand﻿ a CHANCE at restoring any semblance of what this country should be, it's through this guy.

Firefighting Goats are Reducing Wildfires

CHAN: Last year wildfires blazed through more than 500-thousand acres from Malibu to the Mexican border...killing seven people and forcing half a million people to evacuate their homes. Hungry goats come to the rescue. Bite by juicy bite, these goats are fighting California wildfires. That's because this food for goats - come the dry season in June- turns to brush that can fuel devastating flames. Last year wildfires blazed through more than 500-thousand acres from Malibu to the Mexican border ...killing seven people and forcing half a million people to evacuate their homes. This year, the state is adding eleven helicopters, more than a hundred new fire engines... and these guys. Sarah and Hugh Bunten are among about a dozen goat vendors who have been hired by Southern California cities and companies to eat their way through fire-prone areas. [Hugh Bunten, Goat Herder] (male,English): "How long will it take? We figure about an acre a day. So in about a month, they would cover 30 acres." The furry firefighters take several passes through an area before it's clear and safe...and they're ready to move on to greener pastures.

Don't Panic! Russian fires not result of global warming

Order: Reorder

Published: 2010-08-07
Author: RTAmerica


Swathes of central Russia are still in flames - with firefighters tackling hundreds of new fires every day. But, are the Russian wildfires evidence of climate change? Patrick Michaels, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute and climate change skeptic says no. Michaels argued that the increased temperatures in Russia are merely one weather event and cannot be related to global warming. The earth is warmer than it has been in the past, but this does not mean we are facing an apocalyptic climate scenario.

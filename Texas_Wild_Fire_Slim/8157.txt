Lokomotiv officials decide to not play 2011-12 KHL season By      Sean Leahy



On Saturday, tens of thousands of mourners paid their respects to those lost in the tragic plane crash in Russia on Wednesday that took the lives of 43 people, including members of the Yaroslavl Lokomotiv hockey team. The overflow of people meant that the ceremony was extended until 2 p.m. local time.  The ceremony was held inside Arena-2000, Lokomotiv's home.
After the memorial service, team executives announced that despite various ideas on trying to salvage the club for the season, they will not play in the KHL this year.
From Russia Today:
"The main priority now is to take care of the relatives and to pay last tribute to the late players and staff. The other aim is to re-build a competitive team," [Club President Yury] Yakovlev stressed, adding, "This will take some time as well as requiring human resources. But we are determined to resume participation in the KHL in 2012."
The President of Russian Railroads, Lokomotiv's main sponsor, confirmed the position:
"All words of grief can in no way be compared to what's going on inside the souls of the relatives of the deceased.  Right now there is a unity of the community and I am thankful to Yaroslav residents for their love to the team.  The club will definitely be reuilt. But Lokomotiv is not just players and hockey sticks, but also the spirit.  And we have to approach the rebuild of this spirit with care.  We will do everything possible to do it and we will show ourselves in the 2012-2013 season."
There was discussion of having each KHL team loan players so that Lokomotiv could field a team for the season -- with a number of players stepping forward open to the idea -- but focus will now be on providing support to the relatives of the victims and begin the rebuilding process with an eye on the 2012-13 campaign.
Lokomotiv's youth team will play on this season in honor of the senior members of the club.
Via Dmitry, here is the patch that every KHL team will wear to commemorate their fallen Lokomotiv brothers:


The KHL followed that news announcing that going forward the opening game of the season between the Gagarin Cup champions and runners-up will be for the Lokomotiv Cup. On Monday, Salavat Yulaev and Atlant -- who were playing at the time of the crash before the game was abandoned -- will play for the first Lokomotiv Cup.
With additional reporting by Dmitry Chesnokov

0 users disliked this comment Lowell U 18 hours ago Report Abuse I can understand why they suspended the season. I guess I was really hoping someone they would assemble a team and try to get back to normalcy for the team, fans, and city. But realistically, it would be impossible for them to get back to normalcy by playing hockey. They need time to grieve and then slowly get back to playing hockey again. I'll keep Lokomotiv in my prayers until they come back to the KHL

Second,   I couldn't imagine my favorite hockey team going down in a plane crash. And on the commemrative patch,   The NHL should wear this also.

Even if players from other clubs wer made available through some type of 'expansion draft', they would not have time to prepare as the season had already begun. The team likely would not have been competitive if made up from a bunch of cast-offs.This way, the team and the league can take the necessary time to get things settled.

Houseman, "To An Athlete Dying Young"   Rest in Peace and Godspeed.   To all the survivors and the families and fans, who are grieving, our prayers and thoughts will be with you at this time.

0 users disliked this comment Nosferatu Sat Sep 10, 2011 12:03 pm PDT Report Abuse I think the decision is skip the year is appropriate. It's even more appropriate for the 2 teams who were playing at the time to play for the newly created Lokomotiv Cup. Russians and KHL are showing a lot of class.

Bravo to the KHL for handling with such poise.

0 users disliked this comment Joe Sat Sep 10, 2011 09:18 am PDT Report Abuse What does that do to the schedule of all the other teams in the league?   Are they just going to have less travel and more off days, or are they rescheduling everything?   They're back down to 23 teams, which they had last year, so clearly an odd number of teams and unbalanced divisions hasn't been a big problem in the past, but this must create some chaos.   Which of course no one is going to complain about under the circumstances, but I'm still curious.

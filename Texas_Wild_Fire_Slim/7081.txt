* Stand Ready to Serve on Sept. 11's National Day of Service and Remembrance. 
To be "Standing Ready" is to be prepared to help your community in times of disaster. Standing Ready Disaster volunteers can serve their community in a variety of roles to provide a wide range of services such as delivering needed supplies, providing medical or psychological services and caring for pets.
Standing Ready encourages citizen to register their skills and capabilities with the Brazos Valley Council of Governments and United Way of the Brazos Valley's volunteer center at www.volunteerbrazosvalley.org. When help is needed, the volunteer center staff will contact you about disaster response opportunities that match your skills and availability.
* Open Arms Respite Group is doing new volunteer training Sept. 29. 
Seventy-five percent of Alzheimer's patients are taken care of by family and friends. Providing even a few hours of respite can ease depression, provide socialization for both caregiver and participant and allow the caregiver rest, relaxation and renewal.
Volunteers are needed to assist participants in activities such as light exercise, dance, singing, games, devotionals and lunch. Other volunteer roles include contacting agencies or businesses for food donations, serving food, obtaining donations to purchase items for activities or giving presentations. There will also be leadership roles for volunteers who are deeply committed to helping these families. 
If you have a few hours a month to offer a caregiver in need, register for the upcoming volunteer training scheduled for 10:30 a.m.-noon Sept. 29 at Peace Lutheran Church. Call 693-4403 or 764-4090 or send email to openarmsrespitecs@gmail.com by Sept. 26 to register.
* Hospice Volunteer Patient Care Training is looking for volunteers to help families who have a loved one in hospice care. 
Volunteers help by sitting with patients, running errands, reading books or newspaper, providing light housekeeping, lawn care, delivery of flowers or even baking a cake, pie or cookies for patients' birthdays. Volunteers who can provide haircuts, manicures and gentle massages are also needed.
Volunteers are vital in providing personal and caring services to hospice patients and their families. Volunteers are required to attend hospice training before serving. Training will be held at Hospice Brazos Valley from 9 a.m.-3 p.m. Oct. 3-5. Attendance is required each day. Contact Pat Mynar to register for training at 821-2266 or send email to pmynar@hospicebrazosvalley.org.
* The Hospice Thrift Store in Bryan and the Hospice Boutique in Brenham are successful resale shops that sell donated clothing and household items at reasonable prices. Proceeds from the shops support patients and families served by Hospice Brazos Valley.
Volunteers provide customer assistance on the sales floor, merchandise straightening and arranging on the sales floor, moving merchandise from intake area to sales area, operation of cash register, receiving and sorting of donated items, tagging of sorted and readied items, pricing of items for sales floor and participation in education programs.
To volunteer in Bryan, call 821-2266. In Brenham, call 277-9525.
* The Annual Senior Corps RSVP Shirley's Senior Christmas Project is a service Senior Corps RSVP provides to homebound and nursing home residents throughout the Brazos Valley. 
Brazos Valley Area Agency on Aging and activity directors at nursing homes select those without family or resources who will not receive a greeting or a gift for Christmas. Holiday gift bags filled with appropriate items for men and women such as housecoats, nightgowns, sweat pants and tops, socks, slippers, scarves, lotion, bath towels and washcloths are appreciated. 
Shopping thrift stores is a way to make your dollars stretch while helping others. RSVP will gladly accept "like new" clothing and gift items as well as new items. Monetary donations are also appreciated, and RSVP volunteer shoppers will do the shopping for you. 
Gift and monetary donations may be delivered year-round to the RSVP office at 3991 E. 29th St. in Bryan. Office hours are 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. For more information, call Carolyn Kraus at 595-2800, ext. 2026.
* The Retired and Senior Volunteer Program of the Brazos Valley provides this partial list of opportunities and encourages people of all ages to get involved. For information on how to help, call the RSVP office in Bryan Mondays through Fridays at 595-2800, ext. 2026, or visit www.volunteerbrazosvalley.org.

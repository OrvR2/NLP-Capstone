PJ Harvey has won the 2011 Mercury Prize, England's most prestigious award for original music.
The 41-year old singer-songwriter took home the award for her album, "Let England Shake." According to the UK Guardian, she was the favorite to win the prize, at least amongst the bookies taking bets on the award.
It's her second Mercury Prize, following her win for 2001's "Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea." 
Harvey faced stiff competition this year, facing off against superstar Adele, indie rockers Elbow, singer-songwriter James Black and more.

Sweet Billy Pilgrim: Mercury Prize Memories From a Former Nominee


		                        
																When I was told about our Mercury Prize nomination (for Twice Born Men in 2009) I was fitting a toilet seat, as part of my - then - day job. It was certainly one of those fairy-tale moments, despite the confines of the cubicle, my wee soaked knees and the delighted tourettes of a man who can't quite believe his luck.

				You think singing pretty is all that makes an album great? Polly Jean has written amazing songs for 20 years. This is one of her finest albums. Just stunning.

Adele's fine and all, but this is an amazing album.

				Adele is talented, no doubt.  But I don't think she holds a candle to the overall musicality of PJ Harvey.  Start with Dry, fall in love with "Dress" or "Sheela Na Gig" proceed to Bring You my Love, and tell me if you've heard anything more sexually --genuinel­y-- aggressive that "Long Snake Moan..." 

I could go on, but I won't...

				Quite possibly, but as owner and lover of both records, I'd say this: there are a few weak songs on 21 which were saved by Adele's voice. For my money, there's not a weak song on Let England Shake.

				You obviously have no idea about PJ Harvey dear. This woman has been creating fantastic music for 20 years. Go back get educated- listen to her album and THEN comment. My suggestion to get you started would be Is This Desire? You can't form an opinion on something you have no knowledge of.

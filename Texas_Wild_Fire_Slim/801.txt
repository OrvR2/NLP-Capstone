Captured: Remembering 9/11


Posted: Mon, 12 Sep 2011 03:13:30 +0000
(AP) – Determined never to forget but perhaps ready to move on, the nation gently handed Sept. 11 over to history Sunday and etched its memory on a new generation. A stark memorial took its place where twin towers once stood, and the names of the lost resounded from children too young to remember terror from a decade ago.
In New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, across the United States and the world, people carried out rituals now as familiar as they are heartbreaking: American flags unfurled at the new World Trade Center tower and the Eiffel Tower, and tears shed at the base of the Pentagon and a base in Iraq.
It was the 10th time the nation has paused to remember a defining day. In doing so, it closed a decade that produced two wars, deep changes in national security, shifts in everyday life – and, months before it ended, the death at American hands of the elusive terrorist who masterminded the attack.

The Game: USA Pro Cycling Challenge 2011


Posted: Thu, 25 Aug 2011 17:57:45 +0000
Created to be the most challenging race for professional cyclists in American history, the USA Pro Cycling Challenge is set to cover nearly 500 miles in Colorado.
Altitude and climbing will be themes through the entire race. After the opening- day prologue around Colorado Springs on Aug. 22, Stage 1 the next day from Salida to Crested Butte will go up 11,312-foot Monarch Pass and have a mountaintop finish atop Mt. Crested Butte. 
The highlight of the race will be Stage 2 from Gunnison to Aspen on Aug. 24. Billed “the Queen’s Stage,” it will feature ascents over 12,126-foot Cottonwood Pass and 12,095-foot Independence Pass, the highest known climbs in international cycling.
On Stage 3, after the epic rides up Cottonwood and Independence, the 10-mile time trial around Vail will be primarily uphill. Stage 4 from Avon to Steamboat Springs will feature 5,000 feet in elevation change, and Stage 5 from Steamboat to Breckenridge will go over Rabbit Ears Pass.
The final day’s stage from Golden to Denver will go up Lookout Mountain , a 6.1 percent grade with 1,300 feet in elevation over 4.8 miles. However, Steamboat Springs, Breckenridge and Denver will have sprinter finishes.

Pakistani Nargis Shah, 13, enjoys playing on a swing along with other children on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan, Monday, Aug. 15, 2011.
A mother mourns the death of her son at the Banadir hospital on August 16, 2011 in Mogadishu, Somalia. The hospital has been overwhelmed by new patients, as sickness spreads through camps for people displaced by drought and famine. The US government estimates that some 30,000 children have died in southern Somalia in the last 90 days from the crisis. 
Two naval officers react outside for services for U.S.Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Michael Joseph Strange at the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul Thursday, Aug. 18, 2011, in Philadelphia. Strange was assigned to the Navy SEAL team whose Chinook helicopter was shot down Aug. 6 by a rocket-propelled grenade in what has become the deadliest single loss for U.S. forces in the decade-long war in Afghanistan.

Mulmillo, her husband and three children fled their village in the Lower Shabelle region of southern Somalia and came to Mogadishu in search for a refuge from a severe drought in the region. More than 100,000 people have fled to Mogadishu from other drought-struck Somalia regions in search of food and water, but insecurity in one of the world's most dangerous cities is hampering aid flows. Some 12 million people in parts of Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia are in danger of starvation in the wake of the region's worst drought in decades.  AFP PHOTO / ROBERTO SCHMIDT #

In Focus: Greenland Ice


Posted: Mon, 15 Aug 2011 22:50:06 +0000
ILULISSAT, Greenland (AP) — Greenland’s Inuit people have countless terms to describe ice in all its varieties. This gallery of photographs by Brennan Linsley of The Associated Press is something of a visual vocabulary for the striking forms ice takes on the giant Arctic island.
Greenland’s ice sheet and glaciers are melting more and more as the world warms, sending gushing water and towering icebergs into the sea, threatening to raise ocean levels worldwide in the years and decades to come. Researchers are hard at work trying to gauge how much will melt and when. 
Some of the most spectacular icebergs are calved from the 4-mile-wide Jakobshavn Glacier near the town of Ilulissat on Greenland’s west central coast. These icebergs push out into the 30-mile-long Ilulissat Ice Fjord, and then into Disko Bay and eventually the North Atlantic ocean.
The ice, much of it tens of thousands of years old, originates in the 660,000-square-mile ice sheet covering 80 percent of Greenland.

Chief researcher David Holland, hopes to eventually deploy scores of the devices to measure ice loss in Greenland. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) #

Across Greenland's vast white landscape, teams of researchers from around the world are searching for clues to the potential effects of global warming on Greenland's ice.

Morris' research trip is funded by Britain's National Environmental Research Council and mounted with the U.S. National Science Foundation's cooperation. In 2003, Queen Elizabeth honored the intrepid Morris with a Polar Medal, given in recognition of distinguished service in Arctic and Antarctic exploration. Three years earlier the monarch inducted her into the Order of the British Empire. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley) #

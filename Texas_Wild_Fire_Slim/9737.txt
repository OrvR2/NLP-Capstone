Last week, Alton Brown filmed the last-ever episode of successful food show Good Eats after 13 years on the Food Network, NPR reports. Brown announced in May that Good Eats would be ending at the end of the current season. 
Brown has recently been a controversial figure. Many in the food world criticized him for his criticism of the molecular gastronomy movement. This was an especially surprising controversy in light of Brown's general enthusiasm for exactitude in the kitchen; he seemed like someone who would love the intersection of science and cooking.
If you're feeling nostalgic -- or never got a chance to see Good Eats in its prime -- here's a clip of Alton Brown demonstrating his very precise technique for meatloaf.

				It seemed as though the food network had dumped his show in a late night slot that I couldn't stay up to watch, so I guess the writing was on the wall.  But I'll always appreciate AB teaching me more about food than any of those posers on that channel.  I just hope he continues on as host of  Iron Chef.

Live long and prosper Mr. B

				12 years or so ago… I guess it must have been soon after FN began, the cable provider in Colorado Springs offered a free weekend of FN and The Golf Channel and asked it's subscriber­s to watch and rate and then they would decide which to carry.

It was a weekend in spring. Maybe April? That weekend we had several feet of snow fall and I was trapped inside all weekend. The first show I ever saw on FN was Good Eats. I have been a fan every since. 

After the weekend, the word came down that Golf Channel or gold network… whatever its called… had won and they were not going to pick up FN and instead go with Golf. I was heart broken. 

He is one of the best. Like a valued family friend. His recipes never seemed to let me down and is humor and passion for food led me to quit my job and go to culinary school.

His show will be missed.

				Alton taught me how to cook a turkey.  He's a fixture at that network so I'm sure he'll continue to inform us.  And he's right.  Molecular gastronomy is just expensive dinner theater with less food.  I don't really need my sauce centrifuge­d.

				I've cooked for 40 years but he made my cooking better.  He was always entertaini­ng and informativ­e and his recipes were excellent.  They never substitute­d dazzle for good, fundamenta­l flavor and technique.

I hope he will find another project and continue with something more worthwhile than the tired and pointless Iron Chef.

				Back when I was a catering and Pastry Chef profession­ally full time, I saw his show.  At first, I dismissed it as "macho cooking"--­you know, he can't use a spoon, he has to go to Home Depot and buy an industrial sized electric paint stirrer...­that kind of thing.

Anyway...o­ne day I really paid attention (it was the show on rice) and---well­.  My rice got better.

Then I started tuning in all the time---thi­s was at the start of his show---and my cooking got better and more precise...­the thing was, I had MORE control over my results than ever before.

I was a convert.

Killed the cable a year into it, but still look his stuff up online when I'm wading into new waters.  And his Thanksgivi­ng Turkey Show?   My very first turkey was PHENOMONAL because of him!

My only peeve was his more recent tendancy to be the food police.

As the sun set on an airport hotel parking lot in Austin, Texas, Roger Cosby needed to tell his story.
He had just witnessed a sight that many Texans are battling – a devastating wildfire.
The state's largest blaze, a massive, uncontained fire in Bastrop County near Austin, has scorched some 25,000 acres, destroyed at least 470 homes and forced about 5,000 residents to evacuate.
That wildfire on Sunday was near the house Cosby shares with his companion of nine years, Cindy Boyd.
Cosby was taking a nap, while Boyd was working in their shop, making decorative plates.
Then Boyd smelled smoke.
"Roger, we have to go now, we have to go now," Cosby recalls Boyd saying as she woke him.
The Bastrop home that Boyd has lived in for 26 years was on fire.
Cosby says quickly jumped into their car with a few belongings and sped down a long driveway with flames surrounding them on both sides.
"It was like opening the door of an oven," Cosby says.
He says he fears they have lost everything: the house, a workshop, a greenhouse, a truck and worst of all – six acres of trees surrounding the house.
Roger Cosby holds decorative plates, some of the few possessions he was able to salvage.
"It was Cindy's forest," says Cosby, standing next to their getaway car.
He says they hope to return to the house on Tuesday for the first time since the fire to see if anything survived.
"It's all gone. There is no way anything could be left," Cosby struggles to say.
Boyd's forest is now likely a scorched, version of the area she loved so much. They assume charred limbs are all that remain.
Cosby says they have no plans to rebuild on the land they love so much because they believe it will never be the same.

God bless you folks in Texas, and I will keep praying. So heartbreaking to watch. Victoria is correct. The people of Texas and the South as a whole are some of the first to arrive at any natural disasters. Texas people have big hearts. I wouldn't wish this on my worse enemy. Some of you people should be ashamed of yourselves.

NEWS FLASH: A report from FAUX NEWS just said that the Texas fires are the fault of OBAMA. Someone actually photographed Air Force One flying over Texas about a month ago and Obama flipped a lit cigarette butt outof the plane.

Tragic. This will be an interesting test to see if the golden boyu Perry will tell his fellow Texans to "tought it out" and ask help from nature rather the governement because  foir $1 there will be $1 budget cut...
I dont think this fly too well with people who lost it all thru no fault of their won . I even wonder what the Texans would said about this as well. When you live thru a disaster and potential loss of lives, you get a 1st hand understanding of the meaning of help and the meaning of governement. trust me..the neighbours cant always help...

Just like Bachmann said, âI don't know how much God has to do to get the attention of the politicians, we've had an earthquake; weâve had a hurricane. He said, 'Are you going to start listening to me here? Listen to the American people because the American people are roaring right now.'"
Maybe the wildfires are God's response to Rick Perry.

South Texan
I wonder if that's what the people of New Orleans thought during Katrina when Texas took in tens of thousands of their residents?  Were we Texans evil or hated then?  No, in fact, taking in people in need is just normal Texas hospitality.  So right now, when the fine folks from other States bash Texas here on this message board, we don't really worry about them.  Simple-minded people are their own worst enemies...

The US should sell Teaxas and Oklahoma to the Chinese. The Chinese would make it into a free trade zone and manufacture the stuff they send to the US from China. This is job creation Obama Bamba! Get it stupid.

I almost have to laugh . . . not about the fires. The fires are horrible and I feel terrible for all being driven from their homes. The blabber and put downs of Rick Perry almost make me laugh. It's obvious, RP scares the Democrats out of their wits. He's more of a threat to Obama than any other Republican running and they know it.   Their only chance is to start now, start early ripping him to pieces.

Counting Wizard
Its true: Rick Perry is a slick con-man and probably the only Republican that stands a chance of being elected. He's also one of the most crooked and incompetent Governors that Texas has ever had, and the damage that he and his appointees have done to the state will last for generations. Four years after being elected as President, America would mirror the condition of Mexico more than it does today. The problems we have are systemic, and Rick will only hurry us along to a country filled with poor people and a scattering of walled off villas of the wealthy.

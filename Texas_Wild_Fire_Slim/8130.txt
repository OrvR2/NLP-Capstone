Video: Roddick’s U.S. Open outburst forces match to move courts By      Chris Chase




At first, Andy Roddick did a fine job of keeping his cool. He had discovered a bubble caused by seeping water near the baseline of the court at Louis Armstrong Stadium and patiently listened as tournament referee Brian Earley vowed to fix the problem. Roddick and his opponent, David Ferrer, were sent off the court and waited 45 minutes while officials ensured the court was safe and dry.
It wasn't until Roddick and Ferrer returned to the court that the American lost his temper. Upon realizing the court still wasn't fixed, Roddick blew up at Earley, wondering why he and Ferrer were still on the court and how the U.S. Open could allow a match to be played under such conditions. Then he walked off the court, demanding the match be moved.
Classic Roddick.
 
The bubble was caused by the massive amount of rain that fell in New York over the past two days. Roddick and Ferrer were originally scheduled to play Tuesday night but had their match delayed more than 40 hours because of the weather.
After blowing up at Earley, the conversation moved to a hallway inside Armstrong Stadium.
"I realize that you may not be playing on consecutive days but the winner of us is going to have to," Roddick snapped at Earley. "So at a certain point that has to take precedence over what people can watch."
When he overheard Earley suggest Court 13 to someone on the phone, Roddick interrupted.
"Do the thing," he said. "Let's just go play. Let's go play. Thirteen. Let's go play."
The match resumed minutes later on the outside court. Before his match against Ferrer began, Roddick hadn't played a U.S. Open match oustide the 23,000-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium in nine years. Court 13 is decidedly smaller. It has seating capacity for 584 fans.

You are not that good in the first place to be yelling at anyone lol. Learn some professionalism Roddick!! He might get better if he gives his little drama queen attitude a check. Lil boy Roddick got served today by Nadal. Got what he deserved. People are saying that it wasnt an outburst and referencing Johnny Mac..... Please dont compare Candy Andy to the great Johnny Mac. The Mac could back his outbursts up with his play! Roddick needs to start respecting every aspect of the game, be it the umps, other officials, fans, and other players. Grow up Roddick, you imbucile!

0 users disliked this comment Runner 14 hours ago Report Abuse How does the USTA not know that California is the premier state in the US.   New York and especially Flushing Meadows can't compare- in weather, in people, in surroundings everything.   People move to New York only if they have jobs there but move to California even without jobs.   The USTA is incompetent and responsible for generally driving down tennis with their hard court focused tennis which causes injuries to players and produces serve only type players which has brought the US tennis to new lows.   Look at the future of tennis like Nadal, Novak, Murray, these guys are all court players with tremendous speed and with games that make tennis fans want to see them.

0 users disliked this comment John 14 hours ago Report Abuse Since most of you do not follow tennis including Chris Chase.   
This "bubble" turnout to be a 2 foot crack mid baseline in the surface that is leaking water onto the court where the players spend most their time running and stopping.   If it is not fixed it will become slipping and sliding.
Apparently the USTA has determined that this "bubble" is so serious that Armstrong stadium will not be used for the rest of the tournament.
So before you blast someone for pointing out a serious problem, find out the facts.   Of course most of you complainers probably never learned to read.

He is not at par with the rest of them.
I think this is only something that he will use as an excuse when he loses.

0 users disliked this comment Jub Jub 15 hours ago Report Abuse Based on some of the comments I've read here, many people don't realize that Raph. Nadal had a similar complaint about playing on a wet surface just a couple days ago. Then Nadal, Roddick, and I forget who else but another big name tennis player vocally yet calmly told this same Brian Earley fellow that they were concerned about the safety of playing on the wet surface. So this is the third time this complaint has come up in about three days, and I'm sure Roddick's just fed up with not being heard.

2 users disliked this comment Shifty von B... 16 hours ago Report Abuse Someone should serve Roddick up a good beat down. What   a whiner, gimme a break. Anything to draw attention to himself and away from his lack of skill on the court. A little "whoops, I've fallen and can't get up" wouldn't kill little Sally Roderick, Boris Becker made kissing the surface into an artform. Somebody please pass Candy Andy some lotion, I think he is a bit chaffed.

1 users disliked this comment Ted 16 hours ago Report Abuse Roddick displayed great composure and Chis Chase should be removed as a contributor for his erroneous assessment of the situation.   Tennis on wet courts is not in the best interest of the players or the sport.

Another example of a celebrity thinking that a meltdown is appropriate b/c he has money, fame, etc. Once or twice, fine. But it's gotten to the point where every time I see him I just associate it with seeing a spoiled child.

Apparently he was the only one that saw the problem, I don't know.   I remember Mac and yes he need to learn a little professionalize also, it took him 30 yrs.

2 users disliked this comment Craig 16 hours ago Report Abuse any body that doesn’t side with Roddick has probably never played competitive tennis...and is a week end enthusiast only and   who probably moves so slow that nothing could bother them esp a wet surface because they are not trying to pivot on the dime going mock 1 and then change direction quicker than you can say "you have no clue"

1 users disliked this comment NancyT 16 hours ago Report Abuse You call this an outburst! I don't think he even raised his voice that high. I have yelled at my kids louder that that! Both of their careers are at stake if they fall.   And to all those who think this is a sissy sport, you try playing it for hours in the sun. I think we would call you a sissy then. Go find something productive to do in your life!

1 users disliked this comment Tim 16 hours ago Report Abuse I didn't see anything close to a tantrum, Chris Chase you must be a gay drama queen to write a headline like this.   In the future no matter what the headline reads, if you wrote it, I won't even bother reading it.

Could Gwyneth Paltrow be saying goodbye to her leading lady status? Between guest starring as the lovable Holly Holliday on FOX's musical comedy "Glee" and a taking small part in the Hollywood thriller "Contagion," it looks like Gwyneth is taking a step back from major career commitments.
"I have little kids, and I'm a full-time mom," Gwyneth said while promoting her film at the Venice Film Festival. "I really only do small parts." 
The Oscar-winning actress--who is mother to daughter Apple, seven, and son Moses, five, with husband Chris Martin--appears alongside Kate Winslet, Matt Damon and Jude Law in Steven Soderbergh's disaster movie "Contagion." And it looks like Gwyneth is sticking to her new gig as a supporting role actress. After all, she only appears in the ensamble cast thriller for the first 15 minutes. 
Although Apple and Moses are her first priorities, she did take some time to relax in Venice--on Jay-Z's boat, of course. Gwyneth stopped by to congratulate her famous friend Beyonce on her thirtieth birthday and possibly give Beyonce some baby advice, since Beyonce recently announced her pregnancy at the 2011 MTV VMAs. 
But somehow, we don't see Beyonce slowing down anytime soon.

				She only takes small parts because she can't remember more than 2 lines at a time. She really isn't that bright nor that talented. If it weren't for her parents, she'd be a file clerk and married to a bread delivery guy.

				Like any loving parent she realizes that her children need her. Chris is away a lot doing concerts around the world and can't always be there for them. She is a really sweet, caring person and her life isn't all roses and fun. She deals with the loss of her father and the hurtful comments people make about her who don't even know her.

				Laazzzyyy! Party, privileged life breeds Lazy! Bet there are 10's of thousands of Actresses wishing upon the stars for a chance in life like Gwyneth's. Women worthy of a shot at an Oscar through hard work and unforgetta­ble performanc­e, have reason to "throw-up a little" thinking about it.

				I think Ms. Paltrow should be admired.  She puts her children's needs before her own -- isn't that the definition of a parent?  Isn't she right? If you have a child, shouldn't you be there to raise it, especially when they're young?  Otherwise get a cat.

Who the hell told this woman she was talented; or the epitome of motherhood­?
So sick of her self proclaimed perfection on all things Gwyneth. 15 minutes is about all I can take of her in any film, so great for us!

				and I hate how she laughs about being a model, actor, oscar winner, married to a rock star, best friend of Jayzee and Beyonce, Martha Stewart both shiksa and jewish, Hollywood royalty, Brad Pitt's ex, etc etc etc

As an average looking woman she has really ridden the publicity train to it's outer limits. I am surprised she doesn't create a black hole or time warp with all the self promotion she does combined with the truth bending. I mean it should create a worm hole or something.

				Average looking? Wow, you must be amazing to look at. When you see her in person she is stunning, with or without make-up. I have no idea why people love to hate on her. Her parents were in Hollywood, but she worked her way to where she is. She's a great mom, have seen her many times w her kids, very hands-on. She's a supportive wife and is courageous in taking a stab at singing - and doing very well at that too. She works out 2 hours a day when many people are blogging or chatting with friends. She's a great person. Cannot understand all the hating on Gwenie.

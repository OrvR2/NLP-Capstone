SAN FRANCISCO -- In a stunning turn for a team less than one year removed from a World Series championship, the Giants announced Wednesday night that managing general partner Bill Neukom will retire at the end of the year, a decision that sources said came at the request of the ownership group's powerful executive committee.
Neukom will be replaced on Dec. 31 by team President and Chief Operating Officer Larry Baer, who will become chief executive officer. Neukom will be named chairman emeritus, the team said. He is expected to sell his stake in the team to other investors.
Though the bow-tie-loving lawyer ran the Giants during their most glorious season in San Francisco, other partners, particularly those with larger stakes in the team, were said to be upset with the way he communicated with them.
None of the Giants' 32 principal partners owns a majority stake in the Giants. Tori Burns and Trina Burns Dean, the children of the late owners Harmon and Sue Burns, are believed to own the largest share. 
"The Giants have been planning for a transition in which Managing General Partner and CEO Bill Neukom will retire from his position effective December 31, 2011," the team said. "Out of respect to the fans and the team, the organization had planned to announce the transition at the conclusion of the 2011 season."
Neukom, approached as he left AT&T Park Wednesday night, brushed off a Chronicle reporter, saying, "Not tonight. See you in the morning." 
The team's hand was forced after the San Jose Mercury News reported the executive committee's decision Wednesday afternoon.
The newspaper cited sources who said the partners were not happy with the way Neukom spent some of the windfall from the 2010 World Series victory. Player payroll in 2011, for instance, rose about 25 percent over last year's, from roughly $100 million to $125 million.
Lack of consent
 However, The Chronicle learned that the major partners were not upset over how Neukom spent the money, but rather that he did so without their consent. They learned of some major decisions by reading the newspaper.
Recent meetings of the executive committee, of which Neukom is a member, were said to be contentious over that issue. 
Baer helped organize the partnership group that bought the Giants from Bob Lurie in 1992. He is expected to retain general manager Brian Sabean and manager Bruce Bochy, who each have a year remaining on their contracts.
Neukom, 69, made his fortune as Microsoft Corp.'s general counsel for 17 years. He grew up a Giants fan and attended San Mateo High School, Dartmouth College and Stanford Law School.
He made his first investment in the Giants in 1995. He became a general partner in 2003 and replaced Peter Magowan, who headed the group that bought the team from Lurie, as managing general partner in 2008.
The Giants announced that Magowan had retired, but rumors swirled that he, too, was asked to leave in the wake of a number of large contracts that did not pan out, especially the seven-year, $126 million deal given to pitcher Barry Zito before the 2007 season.
Easy to spot
With his tall, thin frame, neatly trimmed gray hair and ubiquitous bow ties, Neukom was easy to spot at the ballpark and in many ways served as a stark contrast to Magowan.
Magowan, who grew up a Giants fan in New York, ran the club with great emotion and was not shy about speaking his mind about the team's play. Neukom was more circumspect, demonstrating a lawyerly caution, and rarely said anything newsworthy in public.
Furthermore, though the Giants raised their payroll significantly during Neukom's watch, the team did not sign any players for longer than two years. He also raised eyebrows around the majors, and even within the organization, when he did not extend the contracts of Sabean and Bochy after the championship, but merely exercised their 2012 options.
After he took the helm of the Giants, Neukom wrote a credo called "The Giants Way," which demanded professionalism across the organization, from the players up to the front office. He also took a keen interest in the new wave of complex statistics known in baseball as Sabermetrics.

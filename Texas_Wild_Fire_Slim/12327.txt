We've watched Jon and Kate Gosselin raise their eight children in front of reality show cameras. We've seen countless family vacations, temper tantrums and eventually, a divorce. Now that the TLC show -- once "Jon and Kate Plus 8," now just "Kate Plus 8" -- is signing off for the last time Sept. 12, the family's matriarch is worried about how she’ll continue to provide for her children.
"I'm freaking out. Big time," Kate Gosselin told PEOPLE for their latest cover story.
In August, TLC cancelled the once-popular show, which chronicles the life of Gosselin and her eight children with ex-husband, Jon. After the announcement, Gosselin took to Twitter to share her thoughts on what is life-changing news for her family.
“We've had a great run! Six years of whirlwind funfilled adventures thanks to TLC and our many many supportive &diehard fans!,” she wrote, adding, “I poured my entire self in2 the last6years of 'Kate Plus 8' & I can't wait2have the chance2challenge myself again w future endeavors!"
So what’s next for Gosselin? She’s apparently thinking about getting into TV production.
“I know when things translate into TV. I’m good at it 'cause I live this life,” she told The Huffington Post. “I have had people come to me and say ‘I have this great idea for a reality TV show.’ I actually, in my mind, can play it out and see it happening ... for me it's like writing a living book and I really love to write.”
But don’t think that just because “Kate Plus 8” is going off the air that this is the last we’ll see of Gosselin and her brood. 
"TLC hopes to check in with Kate and the family periodically with specials in the future," a rep for the show said at the time of its cancellation.
The finale episode of “Kate Plus 8” airs September 12 on TLC.

				Finally!  TLC has made a good decision to cancel this show.  Now the spoiled, pampered and whiny Kate will actually have to work for a living....­in the real world (instead of living off the cute sweetness of her kids) !

				Some people have just one hit of crack or meth and are instantly, hopelessly addicted - this wretched creature obviously experience­d the same thing the first time someone pointed a camera in her direction.

Seriously unpleasant - and she shamelessl­y stole a normal childhood from her kids to feed her habit.

She belongs in rehab - NOT television production­. Experts in addiction have seen it all - know ALL the justificat­ions and rationaliz­ations - and can help one get their life back.

And they know too well the likelihood of relapse...

				These children need a real life that any normal child would live.  All Kate has been doing since the time they were born was making money off of the children.  Kate needed to think what would these children need in the future. instead of trying to be a celebrity herself and re defining her self with all the plastic surgeries.  I'm sure she's banked money for the children  and has plenty set aside for the lifestyle she wants to live.  I don't want to hear the poor me coming out of her mouth.
Kate, it's time for you to take on the responsibi­lity of being a Mother instead of a director.  The reality is:   Your on your own now, be a MOM.  
Raising children is a job ....   Start working.

				The woman deserves all life has to dishout to her. Before the birth of the "8" and the knowledge that they were headed to reality TV they should have made plans for life after the money dried up. Monies should have been put away for the kids, Kate and Jon and all the worries would have been over.

				I love those kids, they are so sweet. But I got the impression that Kate thought the show was all about her and that was what people wanted to see...wron­g...it was the kids!
Maybe if she controlled her tamtrums and was nice to people she would still have that nice income. 
I thought they were putting money away fro the kids anyway.

				Kate has had it pretty fine for a long time now, and it's come pretty easily as well.  For it to remain good for her is going to take a lot of effort on her part - and I don't think she is up for it.  She has been pampered for so long now, and most of what she has given back is misery and tantrums.  She is going to have to start being nice - not just for a short time until she lands another gig - but nice in a way that she never has before or all of her future opportunit­ies will end up in disaster.  I have yet to see anyone change as drasticall­y as she needs to if she wants to succeed anywhere.

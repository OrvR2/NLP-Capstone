Getting back to even on jobs divides US leadersBy TOM RAUM - Associated Press | AP – 16 hrs ago

WASHINGTON (AP) — America's sickly economy can be healed with jobs, jobs and more jobs. On that, everyone agrees. Figuring out how to produce them is what is stumping everyone.Other than letting time take its course, Washington lacks a clear answer on how to create permanent new jobs on a national scale. Forecasters suggest it will take 20 million new jobs over the next 10 years just to repair recession damage and to keep pace with adult population growth.Recent streams of bleak employment and economic data drive home the difficulty of the challenge.As President Barack Obama prepares to tackle jobs issues in a speech to Congress on Thursday, deep divisions persist among economic policymakers on just how to spur job growth. The speech comes as national polls show a clear majority of those surveyed say they disapprove of the way Obama is handling the economy.Lots of schemes have been tried or floated — first under Republican President George W. Bush and now under Democrat Obama. More than $2 trillion has been plowed into stimulus spending, loans and bailouts to banks, auto companies and other corporations, tax cuts for individuals and businesses, mortgage refinancing assistance and aid to state and local governments.But so far, the needle has barely moved on unemployment, which has stayed near or above a frightening recession-level 9 percent for 29 months. It was 9.1 percent in August, same as the month before, with zero net job gains during the month."Neither side can make a definitive case that they really know what they're doing," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and top economic adviser to 2008 GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain.Holtz-Eakin said that while different theories abound, economists have yet to satisfactorily explain business cycles, predict the duration of recessions or explain why some nations' economies grow while others do not. "It's complicated by the fact that we don't live in a textbook world and that, in fact, the government's capacity to do stuff is not infinitely wide."Obama favors a mix of new short-term deficit spending on tax breaks and jobs programs, including ones for roads, bridges and other infrastructure, to keep the economy from falling back into a recession, combined with longer-term steps to trim ballooning deficits."He will make the claim that these are measures that have historically had bipartisan support, can be acted on very quickly by Congress and can have a very quick and positive impact on the economy and employment," White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday. Carney said that Obama's set of proposals for both short-term job creation and longer-term deficit reduction are  "things that Americans across the board are demanding."The need for infrastructure jobs is one of the few areas where there's anything approaching consensus. The concept has won the support not only of Obama, but such rival groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. The differences come in how to pay for it.The administration is running out of ammunition to invigorate the economy before the November 2012 presidential election, especially with a Congress that seems geared to block any Obama measures that increase government spending. The Federal Reserve also has few options left, having kept interest rates at near zero for more than two years.Republicans, who now control the House, overwhelmingly oppose further stimulus measures and are emphasizing deep spending cuts and eliminating regulations they claim discourage business expansion and job creation. Catering to the tea party movement, these Republicans say the private sector, not the government, is the engine of growth and should be allowed to function without government meddling.Republicans have been out singing the praises of limited government and bashing Obama's economic policies.With Congress now back from its summer break, Republicans will "focus on how we stop the federal government from making it so difficult for small business people to create jobs," said Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va.On Obama's left, liberal Democrats are clamoring for even more anti-recessionary spending than he has supported, saying measures enacted thus far have fallen short, given the magnitude of the downturn.They can't all be right.Some 16 million Americans are jobless, nearly half of them for more than six months. The number of unemployed and underemployed is some 25 million, or 16 percent of the adult population. There is but one job available for every four job seekers.Yet there are flaws in both Democratic and Republican prescriptions for healing the economy and generating jobs.For example, amid GOP assertions that getting the government's fiscal house in order will restore business confidence and private-sector jobs, recession-induced belt-tightening by the federal, state and local governments has resulted in widespread layoffs in the public sector."That's not really the way to move forward," said Lawrence Mishel, president of the labor-leaning Economic Policy Institute. For instance, even August's meager 17,000-job gain in the private sector was completely erased by lost public-sector jobs.Many big corporations have ample cash on hand they could use for hiring, but there is little reason to do so. "There is an across-the-board lack of demand for workers," labor economist Heidi Shierholz said.Why would a company invest to build a new plant and equipment if there's nobody to buy what is produced? It's a vicious cycle: Businesses won't hire because they don't have enough customers. But those out of work aren't shopping because they lack incomes.On the Democratic side, many of the proposals expected to be announced by Obama, such as putting construction crews to work on road, bridge and other infrastructure projects and hiring workers to repair public schools, would be, by their very nature, temporary ones. And spending done now must still be paid for later, which is hard to do with a national debt soaring toward $14.7 trillion.Obama also is putting emphasis on creating new jobs by exporting more, calling for approval of more free-trade agreements and seeking to double exports within the next five years. But with global markets soft, the world's top exporters — China, Japan and Germany — also hope to boost their lagging exports. It's a mathematical impossibility for all major trading partners to boost exports at the same time.A major obstacle to job creation is the "mismatch between the jobs being created and the skills of those people who are unemployed," said Rob Shapiro, a former undersecretary of commerce in the Clinton administration. He hopes Obama will include job retraining programs in Thursday's speech, especially in the area of information-technology training for adults.Citing unexpected weaknesses in the economy, White House forecasters a few days ago said unemployment will persist at around 9 percent well into the 2012 election season, revising their contention as recently as June that it would drop to about 8.3 percent next year. Some private forecasts are even gloomier.Getting back to pre-recession jobless rates of below 5 percent — last seen in 2007 — may be a thing of the past."I think we'll get down to 5.5 to 6 percent unemployment and that will be the 'new normal,'" said economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics. "It will take us to the mid-part of the decade to get there, but I think we will get there."But Zandi, who has advised both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, said it also "depends on policymakers getting it roughly right."It's the getting it right part that's such a tall order.

I'm not stumped.  Deport the 20 million illegal aliens and you create at least 5 million new jobs.  Go to a construction site and see what language they speak.  Go to many factories and see what language they speak.  I don't know how Obama had kids because he has no balls.

Off-shoring of jobs has been going on for about 50 years and we can thank both parties, as each had an equal hand in writing and passing the tax legislation that makes it possible and profitable.  Neither party wants to even talk about it, let alone do anything about it.

After WW II through the 50's Japan made JUNK and sold it here in the US.
Now Japan make some of the best goods sold here in the US.
In about 10 to 20 years China will be selling the best goods in the US.
Unless we have fair trade and NOT free trade here in the US.
Now is the time to place tariffs on Chinese goods NOT latter.

The first sign we had economy problems, our nation should of put the breaks on foreigners coming here to live.  Especially if they are impoverished.  Our nation just can't afford to give free handouts to outsiders.  I don't understand why the dumb politicians didn't see they weren't benefitting the country, by allowing them to take below mininum wage jobs, just to please those who were getting greedy with paying people what they deserve, for working so hard.  The french didn't allow poor romanians to stay in their country.

Time to bring back the capitalists,the reason these idiots will never grasp through formulas how to stimulate growth is they sure as hell don't comprehend personal initiative, the risk and reward concept and least of all what can happen when you embrace America's uniqueness as opposed to focusing on what divides us. It is fundamentally impossible for this socialist  to grasp any concept other than the equal sharing with those that have more mantra that all people who lack purpose use to define their feelings of "life isn't fair,BUT we can make it fair" Morons ,simply morons.

The major problem as I see it is that we have a president who does not know how to lead.  A president who knows nothing about creating jobs, a president who has spent the past two and a half years shoving his radical liberal socialists agenda down the throats of the American people with the help of the Democratic Party.  Until we the people rid America of this liberal minded poison called liberalism nothing is going to change.  Nothing is going to get done to bring America back on track until the American people start using their heads and do a better job of electing politicians who do not have this sick liberal demeanor that hates everything that has made America the greatest nation in the world.  Liberalism and political correctness is a sickness that is destroying us from within.

If this is truly the case then most of these jobs will go to union contractors.  So what about the 90% of us that do not belong to a union?  What will you do for us?  As I thought....not one dam thing.

"Many big corporations have ample cash on hand they could use for hiring, but there is little reason to do so." They'll just hire in China anyway. So TAX IT AWAY from the big corporations and use it to subsidize jobs offered by SMALL businesses, the real job creators.

"Forecasters suggest it will take 20 million new jobs over the next 10 years just to repair recession damage and to keep pace with adult population growth."
The article also says 16 million unemployed. I really can't wait ten years to get back to work.

I get really annoyed with both major political parties.  I get annoyed with the Democrats because their policies make matters worse and the Republicans because their policies do nothing to solve the underlying problems.

If you want jobs, you have to look at how jobs are created.  You cannot create a private sector job without investment.  It doesn't matter if it is for equipment, office space, items to be sold, labor costs, or even a squeegee and a bucket.  Jobs are only created through investment - reinvested earnings, borrowed money, share offerings, bonds, private funding, etc.  Any solution to a jobs problem has to include a means of improving and encouraging investment.

All of the mumbo jumbo of investing gets down to 2 basic concepts - perceived risk and reward.  Unfortunately, our government has placed intentional risk (regulatory burdens and as yet unwritten policies, lawsuits, instability of the dollar, etc.) and has punished potential rewards (2nd highest corporate tax rates in the world).  It is no surprise that companies choose to make products and profits off-shore.  They (typically) examine each opportunity on a case-by-case basis and determine how best to take advantage of it.  The good will and social pride of making US jobs rarely overcomes the expected loss of profit margin and competitiveness of adding jobs and creating profits elsewhere.  The labor force is not increased in the US and the profits do not benefit our economy.

We can not continue with this "free trade" crap that we got the short end of. We should cancel all of these and concentrate on bringing jobs back to the USA and getting rid of immigrants who are taking the jobs of "real Americans".  This goes for illegals as well as all of the moslems and Asians who are invading this country. WE DON'T NEED MORE PEOPLE. WE NEED MORE JOBS. Congress is charged with immigration policy. They should do their job and stop the illegals and cut legal immigration to 10% of current.

Maybe we could get as many Nobel prize winning economist as we can together to see what they would suggest. Or maybe we should just tell the big companies that are sitting on all that cash that if they do not start making things here we are coming after it. Or maybe we could get more of the no see no hear no tell monkeys we have now to keep doing what they have been doing all along. Or better yet we could follow the Rights idea and bring back child labor and 7 day work weeks for 1 dollar a day.

I established a Subchapter S Corp and did okay last year.  Not this year. I still have to file an unemployment form with the state each quarter even though I did not draw any income.
If you miss there is a penalty.  No sooner do  you go into business than the regulations and paper work burden start.

NEW YORK (AP) — The joint memoir of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, soon-to-be-retired astronaut Mark Kelly, is coming out Nov. 15.The book, titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope," was written with "The Last Lecture" co-author Jeffrey Zaslow.Scribner spokesman Brian Belfiglio said Wednesday that Giffords "has been fully engaged with the collaborative writing process of the book at every step." An Arizona Democrat, she is still recovering from the Jan. 8 shooting when a gunman opened fire outside a Tucson-area grocery store as she met with constituents.According to Scribner, the book will be a "deeply personal account" covering everything from Giffords' political career to Kelly's time on the space shuttle Endeavour to her recovery over the past several months.Kelly is slated to retire Oct. 1.

Do you often wonder how these books become best-sellers? Libraries are forced to buy them! They are threatened with their funding being cut off by the Jewish Lobby in Washington if they do not comply!

Do not buy this book---donate your money to some needy children or poor animals.

This book coming out now is no surprise to anyone, is it?  We know the pro-forma here -- "...she may not run for re-election, but her husband will gallantly stand in her stead and carry on her good work...".  Their couples' manifesto is published before the primary/election, and sure as night follows day, hubby will ride her injuries into the House of Reps or the Senate.

Good God.

Now I am laughing because this is becoming ridiculous...My DEEPEST apologies to anyone I offended, and have admitted that I did not have my facts straight...I never vomited 
spewed any hatred..that is what you choose to read in my words. I am a pacifist, a lover not a hater. It's amazing how my using one word (the "tb" word) can evoke such venom from some of you, but someone here can call me the c-word and it's okay. And my name is not Liz, or Lizzie but Elizabeth. All of that aside, let us all find love and compassion in our hearts...once again, we are ONE HUMAN FAMILY on this earth...God bless.

Good for them!

Although only seeing the headline and since I just read an article about Regis Philbin retiring from his show, I thought it was a Kathy Lee Giffords/Kelly Ripa book!

I hope that she continues to recover, but REALLY!
US Grant wrote his memoirs, by himself, by hand, while he was dying of throat cancer.
THAT was a literary accomplishment worthy of praise.  This is just a stunt. 

BTW, Grant's book is a must read for all Civil War buffs.  
Mark Twain published it, and it was one of the most popular books of the 19th century

She can't remember what she had for breakfast, how is she supposed to write her memoirs? No, I'm not being callous and cold, I'm serious!

Cannot believe the haters on here.  This woman barely survived the shooting and is still in rehab, to try to come back to where she was before.  And to think there are people who wish she had not survived or remains in a restricted state permanently.  All I can say is your day is coming, haters.  Are you prepared to face the possibility that something tragic could end up happening to you?

If you're greatest career move is being a victim, you suck. She was shot by a liberal, by the way. A liberal who also shot a republican.

Elizabeth, most of what you say rocks!  However, don't pin this on the Tea Party.  This nut job acted on his own!

Arkansas police are investigating the death of a man found naked in a hot tub next to a sleeping TV weatherman.
A friend woke meteorologist Brett Cummins, of Little Rock station KARK, on Labor Day. He found the forecaster snoring in the empty whirlpool next to a nude man with a dog collar around his neck, The Arkansas Democrat & Gazette reported. 
The 36-year-old resident who made the grisly discovery, Christopher Barbour, allegedly told police that the victim, 24-year-old Dexter Williams, was blue in the face and lying near Cummins' shoulder, ArkansasNews.com reported.
Barbour say the two men were in his home the night before, drinking and snorting drugs. Police haven't determined the cause of death, but a detective allegedly found a ring of blood in the bottom of the empty tub, ArkansasNews.com said. 
Police are waiting for autopsy results and don't consider Cummins a suspect, radio station KUAR said. 
KARK announced on Tuesday that Cummins wouldn't be on the air because he's "mourning the loss of a friend."

				I'd wait for the autopsy results before declaring anyone innocent.  This story ranks pretty high on the creepy Richter Scale.  Snorting drugs doesn't normally result in heavy bleeding.  I mean I'm no expert though.

				Once the local TV news anchor for the CBS affiliate in my town checked into the emergency room with a hamster stuck up his rear end, but the local news kept quiet about it and he's still on the air. I mean, nobody's perfect, and most news teams have people on them who sometimes do embarrassi­ng things like this. Doesn't sound like murder, they were probably just having some good clean fun together and one of 'em ODed on the drugs while they were in the hottub playing with each other. It's understand­able, that kind of thing happens all the time. But I do think that news teams could get higher ratings if they actually showed some of the more interestin­g things that some of the news anchors do when they're not at work. I would recommend that the next time someone from the local news does something like this, they bring a camera along, and while they might have to censor the images or some of the language from the videos they record, it would really bring in the ratings and capture the attention of all those channel surfers looking for something interestin­g on TV.

				That station should discontinu­e its' news department­. 
They have reported nothing on this major (for a public figure in a small city) story. 
They simply said that Cummins was at home at the time and is off today to mourn
the death of his friend. 
That's not news.

by Mark Wiggins and Christine McCarthyWHITNEY - Fire crews continued Friday to battle back the remnants of a large wildfire that started Thursday near the Lake Whitney Dam and charred 750 acres.The fire destroyed seven homes, forced evacuations and caused power and water outages for hundreds of people.At 8:00 Friday night, the blaze was 85 percent contained, with a shift of eight fire crews consistently monitoring hot spots.Those whose homes survived shared their frightening ordeal with News Channel 25.  For neighbor Preston Primm, it was a startling realization of the power of nature's wrath."I seen a lot of flames, a lot of smoke, it was real crazy," says Primm. "I've never had anything happen like this before in my life."Down the road, Kim Townson was one of dozens evacuated as flames raged out of control. "I had to grab the dogs and get out," says Townson.  When she was allowed to return late Thursday night, she feared the worst.  Less than a hundred yards from a moonscape of charred grass, her home survived."Blessed, very blessed," says Townson.  "God was watching out for us."By Friday afternoon, emergency crews had set up a command center at Prairie Valley Baptist Church.  The church's two main buildings buzzed with emergency workers organizing volunteers, supporting evacuees, and planning containment efforts."We've had an overabundance of people bringing water, supplies in for our firefighters, donations for the evacuees," says Whitney Fire Department Public Information Officer Debbie Moore.  "Everybody in the community and different communities have just been great with this."As crews continue to advance against the fire, returning neighbors are rallying together -- all of them praising the firefighters from half a dozen agencies that have arrived to defend their homes."You know, you watch it on TV and you don't think it will ever happen to you and then it does," says neighbor Debbie Hunt.  "It was a major relief to come home and see it was still standing, but then it's depression because the people over there lost their homes."The emergency team held a meeting at the church at 8:00 Friday night.  There they arranged for new fire crews to relieve the fire fighters who had been battling the flames around the clock.In an adjoining room, the Heart of Texas Red Cross provided food, clothing and housing arrangements for evacuees and those who have lost their homes.  Counseling and mental health services are also available, especially for those who lost pets in the fire.Authors: AdministratorRead more: http://www.kxxv.com/story/15430056/wildfire-community-rallies-to-action-near-whitney-damTagsCentral Texas News  lake whitney dam  mark wiggins  public information officer  containment efforts  startling realization

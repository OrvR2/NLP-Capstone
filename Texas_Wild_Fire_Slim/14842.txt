United Way making a difference

Tom Lamarche, general sales manager for Suddenlink Media in Central Texas, became interested in helping the United Way of the Brazos Valley when a representative asked him during a benefit to go to businesses asking for their support.
Lamarche said he and Don Dickenson, United Way's senior relationship manager, were volunteering at the Bryan-College Station Chamber of Commerce's Ladies Nite in College Station when Dickenson enlisted his help.
Lamarche is what United Way refers to as one of its "loaned executives," volunteers who spread the word about what the nonprofit does, said Laurie Garrett, United Way's vice president of marketing and relationship management. 
Garrett and Kyle Gammenthaler, the organization's relationship manager, made their first stop of the day Wednesday at Suddenlink in College Station to visit with Lamarche as part of the first United Way Awareness Day, an event Garrett said she hopes to hold each year.
The goal of the day was to educate organizations and businesses about United Way. It works with 28 local nonprofits in Brazos, Burleson, Grimes, Leon, Madison, Robertson and Washington counties. 
Last year, United Way volunteers received requests for twice the amount of funding that was available, according to the organization.
The day kicked off with an 8 a.m. breakfast, where United Way representatives met to find out which other representative they were teaming up with and which businesses, governmental entities or nonprofits they were visiting. They also watched a short campaign video about United Way, and picked up packets of information they would be handing out.
"Today's message is to talk about who we are and how we can help," Garrett told the group.
The group visiting organizations in Brazos, Robertson and Washington counties on Wednesday mostly consisted of United Way board members, but also included a few people with whom United Way had various partnerships, such as College Station Fire Chief R.B. Alley and the fire department's public education officer, Cindy Giedraitis.
What United Way does
United Way funds provide services that help achieve goals such as connecting community members with health and human service resources, helping youth learn and develop into healthy productive adults, strengthening families, promoting self-sufficiency and building safer communities, according to the website.
One service is 2-1-1, a partnership between the organization and the state's Department of Health and Human Services. It is a free information and referral line, answered by nationally certified specialists 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
Callers are connected to the call center in their region, and experts have a comprehensive database of community-based organizations, government agencies and nonprofits. The service can provide information about child care, senior services, volunteer opportunities,  food and shelter. 
Garrett said the information line especially becomes important during a natural disaster, when people are needing to know where they should stay and what roads are blocked.
Last year, 2-1-1 answered more than 40,000 calls, according to Alison Prince, vice president of community impact. This year, it could field 50,000 calls.
The United Way, through a partnership with the Brazos Valley and the Brazos Valley Council of Governments, also provides a volunteer center at www.volunteerbrazosvalley.org. Gammenthaler called the center an "eHarmony for volunteers," comparing it to the dating website because it matches volunteers with volunteer opportunities.
The organization, through an initiative with the Brazos Valley Community Action Agency and Citi Bank, also provides Individual Development Accounts (IDAs), savings accounts for low- to moderate-income families.
Participants can save to buy a home, further education or start a small business; at the end of the savings period, United Way provides a match twice that of what the person saved. Participants also receive financial education for budgeting, credit management and banking.
How to help
United Way representatives say people can help by giving, advocating or volunteering.
The organization raises the majority of its money through workplace campaigns, Garrett said. Employees can fill out pledge forms that allow a payroll deduction, or they can make a one-time donation. Some businesses will provide a match to what their employees give, she said, and some companies will give a corporate gift.
Garrett said she visited with Lamarche because his company agreed to hold a campaign for the first time this year. 
"What I'm getting involved with is the boarder marketing," Lamarche told her, adding that he hoped to help get the word out about what the organization does and that employees would volunteer as well as donate.
Lamarche said his company would help create public service announcements for United Way, and said he has been working for two or three months on preparations for a campaign.
Lamarche said he decided to help United Way because it was a worthy organization, and he likes that the money will stay in the community. He added that being associated with a charity doesn't hurt his company, either.
"I just think it's nice to know when you're helping the United Way, you're helping your neighbor," he said.
Garrett's next stop was Star Furniture in Bryan, which holds a company campaign. It is also planning a 40th anniversary celebration on Oct. 12, which will benefit the United Way and get people involved, said store manager Anita Murillo.
She said she is proud of the store's plaques from the organization. She, too, likes that the money stays local. 
Garrett also stopped at Briarcrest Cleaners nearby to see the donations that had been dropped off for wildfire victims. She said her organization was helping to determine what was needed where.
She also visited Joe Adair, district manager, at the Double Dave's PizzaWorks in Bryan, to discuss the company's "United We Roll" event set for Oct. 27. "Celebrity rollers" from the community will make pizzas that evening, and a portion of the day's proceeds will go to United Way.
Adair said it's fun to do something that's "out of the ordinary" to help the nonprofit, and it provided a chance for networking and community involvement.

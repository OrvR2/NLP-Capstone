All of us have felt loss. 
The loss I know the deepest is the loss I’ve experienced as a daughter. So when I wanted to understand what the past 10 years have been like for those most personally affected, I talked to the daughters of the victims of 9/11.
There are people who look at 9/11 with fear, bitterness and anger. These women look at it with hope. I’d like to introduce you to two of them.
Anne Earthman knows exactly what she’ll be doing the afternoon of September 11, 2011. After observing the remembrance ceremonies at Ground Zero, she’ll go to the cemetery where her mother, Elvira Granitto, is buried and have a little mother-daughter chat. They have a lot to talk about: Anne, 21, is a senior now at St. Thomas Aquinas College in Rockland County, New York, majoring in criminal justice and a recipient of a grant from the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund.
Before this happened, she was an 11-year-old little girl who dreamed of becoming a dancer or a teacher. After the death of her mother, that dramatically changed.
Alexandra Wald was just starting her first day of high school when her father, Victor Wald, a stockbroker, died in the north tower. Just a week before, he had told his 13-year-old daughter that the worst thing she could ever do was ask  “what if?’’ about her life.
So Alexandra, now 23, looks at the future, hoping to ensure that a 9/11 never happens again. That’s why, with her grant from The Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund, she majored in Islamic studies and Arabic at Vanderbilt University and interned at the Department of Homeland Security.
Her story is surprising and inspiring.

				WAR


As war is fought it takes charge
And events spin out of control.
The madness of men can alter the soil
Which nourishes the roots of their soul.

Many things will forever change
Far more then wished to be.
As the wrath of war starts to destroy
Those things we fight to keep free.

War is the greatest plague of man,
Religion, state and sanity.
Any scourge is more preferred
Than the one which disables humanity.

When war breaks out, boundaries change
And all who die are a token
Of the rage that must run it's course
Before words of peace are spoken.

				OUR FLAG


Our flag is fabric wove of thread
Carried by heroes live and dead.
She stands for justice and courage too
With her colors; red, white and blue.

For all who serve her, there’ll be cheers
For any who die, there’ll be tears
For all who love her, honor will prevail 
Any who harm her, shall suffer and fail.

How many moms have cried before
As they sent their children to war?
How many dads have not returned
Because our freedom must be earned?

Wars were waged where brave men died
As patriots fought side by side.
Our flag is still the pearl of earth
Because of those who prove her worth.


AMERICAN SOLDIER


It’s not a priest that gives us our freedom of religion
And it’s not a reporter that gives us our freedom of voice.
It’s not any judge, lawyer, politician­, preacher or teacher
But the blood of a soldier that has sacrificed by choice.

				FREEDOM


In their new uniforms
The young march off
Not knowing who shall return.
With a proud devotion
They brandish their flag
Leaving loved ones to wonder and yearn.

May we all be buried
By all of our children
Is an ancient tribal prayer.
They're so easy to lose
But so hard to forget
Such a burden for a parent to bear.

The taste of victory
Shall soon be forgotten
But never that which was lost.
For those rows of white headstones
In peaceful green fields
Make it easy to tally the cost.

America has survived
All attempts to destroy
Knowing the cruelty of war
And we who remain
Must help keep her free
For those who can march no more!

				FORMIDABLE FOE


America is the birthday cake of earth
As the ants march from every direction.
Thank God for all who have sworn to defend her
Serving with love, honor, pride, and affection.

Since the first day George Washington marched off to war
There have been those who have wished our demise.
Their hatred, fueled by jealousy and greed
Was defeated by our brave and the wise.

Once again, we must face a formidable foe
Who have pledged by their God to destroy us all.
Misusing their faith as an excuse to kill
As for a worldwide jihad, their leaders call.

Some say we should try to appease them 
For if we resist, they'll hate us even more. 
But the David's among us shall cast our stones 
Defeating them, as it was done before.

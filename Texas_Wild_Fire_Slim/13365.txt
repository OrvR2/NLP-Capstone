5 Surefire Ways to NOT Get the Job You Want













Lindsay Olson, 	On Thursday September 8, 2011, 9:30 am EDT

Sometimes being overly eager in your job hunt works against you. Being too aggressive about the job you want and rushing through critical points in the process could make you the last person on the hiring manager's list. Here are some mistakes to avoid:[See 15 Ways Good Bosses Keep Their Best Employees.]1. Cutting and pasting your cover letter. A standard outline of your cover letter is fine to have on hand, but the trick is to customize your cover letter each and every time you apply for a job. That means incorporating elements from the job description, as well as addressing the letter to the hiring manager, if possible.2. Not proofreading your resume and cover letter. Want to look unprofessional? Then don't bother proofreading your resume and cover letter. Grammatical errors will surely not land you the job you want! Read through to make sure you haven't made errors. If you have the hiring manager's name, double check that you spelled it correctly. Run the document through Spellcheck for one last proof. If possible, run it by a trusted friend. It never hurts to have another set of eyes look it over.3. Not preparing for your interview. If you don't dress the part, chances are you won't get hired. However, there is one caveat to this: Try to look into what the company culture is like before your interview. At one company, a business suit might be the ticket to making a dazzling first impression, while at another, they might think you've overdone it if they're a little looser when it comes to a dress code.In addition to learning everything you can about the company beforehand, you should also consider what you might be asked in an interview, and how you will respond. Build your mini-stories by thinking about the company's challenges or the challenges this role creates, and then about what you can do or have done in the past to overcome these obstacles. And minimize your vocalized pauses! "Uhs" and "Ums" don't make you seem like a confident candidate.[See 5 Questions to Ask the Hiring Manager.]4. Skipping the thank-you note. Your interview is over and you plan to follow up a week later. Did you forget anything? A thank-you note, while it won't guarantee you get the job, usually does leave a favorable impression with the hiring manager. And it just might be the one thing that makes you stand out from the other applicants. You should send this out within a day or two of the job interview.While we're talking about followup: It's appropriate to follow up with the employer a week after your interview. Hiring managers have to interview several candidates in addition to being busy with their regular work, so it may take time to make the decision. At the one-week mark, if they haven't chosen a candidate, ask when they expect to, and respectfully ask if you can follow up again at that time.5. Getting angry that you didn't get the job. You thought you were ideal for the position, but you didn't get it. It's normal to feel frustrated, especially if you were led through a lengthy process. Now you want to lash out at the HR manager. Keep your emotions in check, though. Venting could lose you the opportunity to be considered for future roles at the company. Instead, wait until you calm down, and then contact the hiring manager to ask for positive feedback on why you didn't get hired. It can help you with future job interviews and applications.Lindsay Olson is a founding partner and public relations recruiter with Paradigm Staffing and Hoojobs, a niche job board for public relations, communications and social media jobs.

0 users disliked this comment kathleen 6 minutes ago Report Abuse I find a lot of these advice columns on job hunting to be self promoting - take this career workshop, course, book etc.   The reality of job hunting is that you get the job if you know someone - someone with some say I might add.   You can follow all the rules to the letter and find out later the person hired knew the boss or even better was related to the "boss".   The trick is not to take rejection personally.   You haven't done anything wrong - nor have you been lazy, neglectful or mindless.

Don't grab your boss by the neck and force his/her head down between your butt cheeks and unleash a devastating fart.   Some male employers may appreciate the humour in it, but women, not so much.

0 users disliked this comment Citizen 827 8 hours ago Report Abuse I have never thought of sending a thankyou note after an interview and I dont think I would. While I am happy I was chosen for an interview I think it shows a certain lack of self confidance to be thanking your potential employer for something as trivial as the first interview.  

The job I have now I had 2 interviews. My coworkers have told me that some of them had to re-apply for the same position 5 times and go through 3 or 4 interviews each.  

My boss and I are now friends. I asked him why only   2 interviews? He said because I was honest, he could tell I wasnt just telling him what he wanted to hear, and because these 2 things demonstrated to him that I was confidant in my ability to do the job that I had applied for.

I am now in the interview process for a very high profile career change from account executive to being a well paid consultant for a well known company. Again Im trying to be honest with my interviewer, not just give him lip service to get the job, and becase of these things again i am quite confidant i will get the job. If you dont know the answer to a question, tell your interviewer you dont know and that you are interesting in learning more about the subject ( if you are). Maybe it was a trick question and the interviewer was testing to see your willingness to learn new things or if you are just going to try and flub your way through all the tings you dont know.  

Pride will kill you, confidance in your strengths and wekanesses and knowing how to work through both will carry you a long ways.

1 users disliked this comment H.J. 11 hours ago Report Abuse Here's a few of the reasons ive not been hired.
1. The hiring agent/manager was younger than I.
2. I was way too experienced for that position
3. I wanted to accept the minimum pay offered
4. I don't speak french in an English establishment in Montreal

To counter that I opened my own bakery and now they have to ask me for a job.

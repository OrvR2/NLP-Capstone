Tropical Depression 14 forms, and the new Gulf threat

The Atlantic season’s 14th tropical depression has formed in the Atlantic Ocean this afternoon, and it likely will soon become Tropical Storm Maria.
Tropical Depression 14 is already a large system. (EUMETSAT)
This system should gradually strengthen as it moves west-northwest across the ocean toward the northeastern Caribbean Sea.
The track models are fairly consistent with the depression over the next five days:
12z track forecast models for Tropical Depression 14. (NCAR)
At this point the smart money is probably on a track for Maria to be similar to that of Hurricane Katia, bringing it fairly close to the East Coast of the United States, without bringing it close enough to really matter.
However, unlike with Katia, there’s a significant threat to the Caribbean from Maria.
With all that said, it’s too early to make such calls yet. For now we’ll have to watch as the system tracks toward the Leeward Islands.
GULF THREAT
The other system we need to watch, which has been designated Invest 96L, lies in the Bay of Campeche.
The models are all over the place with this system, either bringing it southwest into Mexico or eventually pulling it to the northeast, toward the northern Gulf of Mexico coast.
So yes, the models are evenly split between a southwesterly and a northeasterly motion for this system. Nice.
18z track models for Invest 96L. (NCAR)
One point of concern with this system is this afternoon’s run of the European model, which brings Invest 96L toward New Orleans as a large hurricane by late Saturday or early Sunday morning.
This is worrisome because it suggests the possibility of a rapidly moving and developing storm that could catch an area already fatigued by Tropical Storm Lee unprepared. Hopefully we’ll see some more consistency in future model runs.
With a high pressure system in place, Texas seems an unlikely landing spot for this system.

Is it my imagination or are most of the Atlantic storms being sucked up the East Coast this year?  If so then is there a reason for that or is it a coincidence?

Or perhaps Perry’s hot air caused the drought, wildfires and pushed away from Texas any tropical rainfall relief?
Seems to me this was God’s latest response to Perry’s ballyhooed “pray for rain” scientfic approach to disaster relief. Of he reiterated again recently in South Carolina. I guess the projected tracks of soon to be Maria and invest 96L is God’s consistent responses to Perry’s “prayers”? He just doesn’t get it, does he?

In the 1950′s Texas had the worst drought, until now.  During that period, there were 2 east coast hurricanes, and right after that, two gulf systems.  The weather goes in cycles.  Hopefully this will not happen for another 50+ years.








bob says: 

			September 6, 2011 at 10:56 pm 
when i was visiting FL this summer, they knew emily would take a track that kept it away from the fl coast.
this was due to a weather pattern like the jet stream, gulf stream, etc pushing from west to east off the FL coast.  i cannot remember specifically.
nice observation & no, it’s not a coincidence.  
these storms are affected by a number of weather conditions & that’s why meteorologists are able to study those conditions, along with the paths of storms in previous years to predict the current storms’ paths.

The high pressure that’s been sitting over Texas has been pushing away storms while also causing the record heat.

Someone needs to tell this high pressure system that we are really tired of it and it should move elsewhere.  Not that I want a hurricane, but while that high sits there, rainfall potential is very low.

Someone needs to write a take off on John Denver’s song Rocky Mountain High for Texas. We don’t have many of those beautiful mountain peaks that Colorado has in spades but it seems we do have a pretty darned persistant weather high.

I’m not wishing for a hurricane to hit us at all.  Because we need rain, not a major hurricane.  However, we can’t get even get rain in the worst way ever, which is a major hurricane.  Our bad luck for rain is so bad, we can’t even have bad luck and have a hurricane. haha.

We don’t know where these storms will go, but we know they won’t come here, so that narrows it down. (I like how the models have it avoiding Texas as if they were opposing magnets.)
I was just thinking about how all we got from Lee was rampaging wildfires. I was reminded of the Katrina episode of South Park, where that guy’s sitting on his roof in floodwaters, surrounded by burning oil, and he says, really sarcastically, “Thanks, that’s *much* better.”
Honestly, I pretty much figured next on our agenda would be a rain of fire. Or possibly Godzilla, but I’ve not ruled out Godzilla yet. (Yes, California would be a more convenient point of arrival for him, but trust me, he’ll go around and show up here, anyway.)

StanleyS says: 

			September 6, 2011 at 4:25 pm 
With our luck, the massive earthquakes near Japan probably scared Godzilla enough to send him swimming northward between Siberia and Alaska. Then, being stuck under the Arctic ice cap, he probably had to continue swimming until he found the strait between Greenland and North America.
Even now, he is probably swimming southward just off the East Coast. When he reaches the Florida Straits he will probably instinctively turn west, hoping to return home, and make a beeline straight across the Gulf to Texas.

On the bright side, there shouldn’t be too many more named storms this year if NOAA’s forecast is correct. (And it usually is.) We are already up to the twelfth named storm out of nineteen expected. And if our batting average stays where it is, only one or two of the “remaining” storms will turn into hurricanes.
On the other hand, the two hurricanes that we have had did almost as much fiscal damage as all twelve hurricanes that hit last year…

Eric Berger says: 

			September 6, 2011 at 4:39 pm 
It looks like those fear-mongers at NOAA (and others) under-predicted again. At this rate (with Maria likely coming tomorrow) 20 named storms in 2011 wouldn’t surprise me.

If we taunt the high and tease it mercilessly, maybe it will move away.  Or not.  I have never despised the weather more than I do this summer!

I recall China was attempting to bring some weather their way for the Olympics to chase away their horrible air pollution. We get just about everything else from them maybe we could hire them to move the high off somewhere else. Like the current Ram truck ad says when can’t be done comes to must be done…and we sure have reached that point with this drought.

Texas went for Roosevelt in 1932
and Ma Ferguson for governor.
and it still took years to get out
of the depression.
I don’t think politicians have much say over it.
But if you look at the Allred years
where he fought corporations and chain stores,
at least we got a hurricane in 1936
that cause the Colorado and Brazos to
rise, merge and flow as one to the gulf.
Maybe we should dig Allred up.

I had a curious question:  I check a website regarding earthquakes…and I wondered if there was in history an event that shows a hurricane happening over a tsunami from an earthquake?  I thought that would really be a bad scene unless the tsunami and the hurricane storm surge was in opposition to one another?
any thoughts on this Eric?


Reply 





JohnD says: 

			September 6, 2011 at 8:07 pm 
Earthquakes do not cause hurricanes. Tsunamis do not cause hurricanes. Solar heating of the ocean’s surface causes hurricanes.








StanleyS says: 

			September 6, 2011 at 9:20 pm 
Kay Jordan, I think that JohnD has misunderstood your question, but I am not sure.
Were you asking whether there was ever an event in history where a tsunami and a hurricane or typhoon just happened by coincidence in the same location at the same time.
Or were you asking whether there was ever an event in history where one of them caused the other?
It seems to me that you meant the first, but that JohnD thought that you meant the second. (But I could be mistaken, of course.)








JohnD says: 

			September 7, 2011 at 2:32 pm 
StanleyS, thanks for the clarification; my science-to-English filter has been acting up lately.
There have been times when hurricanes passed over tsunamis. In general, not much happened. That is because when a tsunami is out in deep water, it is a very small, very broad wave. Tsunamis only become relatively tall when they get into shallow water.
However, in Haiti this past year, a hurricane passed over an area ravaged by earthquakes. “Misery” does not begin to describe the scene.

That brings up an interesting thought. If we never get anymore rain we’ll never be able to touch that rainy day fund. We need to think up a new name for this pot of money just sitting there with such drastic cuts to education in the state. Perry keep touting his jobs record in Texas. If we don’t do a better job of educating the youth of Texas and soon when they get to the looking for jobs age they won’t be qualified to fill them.

Where this disturbance is located (deep in the Bay of Campeche) it would need to move just E of due North or about 010 degrees.
Looking at the water vapor floater for 96L, no way it is coming our way.  Air is way too dry but you can see that changing to the east of us. (Louisiana)

the drought is the fault of the green people.
for thousands of years, the southern part of texas had no trees, just great plains. as people moved here they brought trees and then the green people came and brought many more trees.
mother nature must not want all these trees, hence the drought.
don’t mess with mother nature.

The people to whom you refer are a psychological type who are incapable of happiness unless they have something to be angry about, all of the time. To them, everything bad that happens is Barack Obama’s fault, was George Bush’s fault, or will be Rick Perry’s fault. Always.

Stanley, you got it right about my question.  I know they can’t be the cause of the other happening.  I wondered what the effect would be if that happened at the same time in the same location.

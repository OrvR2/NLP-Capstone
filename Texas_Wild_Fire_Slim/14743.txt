Bowman Lake - Glacier National Park






This is day four and five of our five day backpacking trip through Glacier National Park. Click here to read days One, Two and Three. 

I’m sitting around the campfire at the Upper Bowman backcountry campsite. We have spent all day hiking over Brown pass. We are cold, wet, and exhausted. But we are not alone. A group of kayakers have paddled in seven miles from the other end of Lake Bowman. We talk over the campfire and before long consider them friends. Tomorrow they will hike up toward Hole in the wall. We, on the other hand, plan to take it easy with a layover day. 

Our new friends ask us “What are you going to do all day? 

“Oh I don’t know. We are thinking about pirating a few kayaks” our guide jokes. 

“No one is going to be using them” our new friends say “Why don’t you guys take them out on the lake? 

I think “you have to be kidding me.”



Our view from Upper Bowman Campsite
The next day we sleep in and take it easy. I stroll around camp...check out Numa Creek. Take a nap on the hikers bridge, but spend most of the day laying on the beach of Lake Bowman. At one point my wife looks out across the lake and says “What is that?” Something large and clumsy is swimming the length of the lake. “It can’t be a duck...Its too awkward.” I run back to my pack and grab a telephoto lens. “It’s a moose!” I say. Everyone around wants to take a look.

A Moose swimming across Bowman Lake
I look down at the Kayaks laying on the shore of the lake...I have permission...I ought to chase down that moose and have a closer look. But I’m not sure how she will react to a strange creature floating on top of the water. Plus I don’t want to seem too anxious to use the boats. So I wait.

I lay on the beach some more...but I really want to be out paddling on the lake. Eventually my wife heads back to the tent to take a nap, and I take the opportunity to paddle out on the lake. But I have waited too long. Afternoon winds have picked up and make the water choppy. I paddle about mile into the wind before giving up. So I turn around and let the wind push me back. It was really quite peaceful...and the view was even better out on the water. 



Kayaking on Bowman Lake
The next day it was time to head out. We had seven miles to hike along the edge of the lake. Our friends in the Kayaks head off at the same time and before long pass us on the lake. 



Hiking out on the Bowman Lake Trail


Tall trees on the Bowman Lake Trail
As we make our way out we find a small batch of wild Strawberries. They are tiny, but delicious. The rest of the trail was mostly flat and uneventful. My wife was still suffering from painful blisters and had damaged her toe nails coming down from Brown Pass. We aren't quite sure what kind of injury she has sustained but it is beginning to look like it is permanent...just the other night we were getting in bed and her toenail started to come all the way off. Her toe nails on both feet are black and damaged, once we find out more I will post in-depth about what has happened and how I think we could have avoided it. 
Before we know it we come to the end of the trail. Waiting for us is another guide who has set up a picnic for us. I pile everything in sight onto my sandwich and drink an ice cold soda under the shade of a tall tree. It has been a great trip...but it feels good to be getting back to civilization.

I'm not sure what to call this injury...Hikers toe?


Picnic provided by Glacier Guides
Our five days through Glacier’s backcountry were unforgettable. I want to say thank you to Glacier Guides for such an amazing trip. I also want to say thank you to Agion Active for offering such a great contest. If it wasn’t for them I would have never been able to experience such an amazing park in such a powerful way. Our time there has only made me want to see more. Glacier National park is truly an amazing place.

What Are The Top Outdoor Blogs? Your Opinions Please






I follow a lot of outdoor blogs...so many in fact that I can't really follow them all. It seems I always end up missing something of real quality because my newsfeed is choked with stuff I don't always care to read. So the other day I went about trying to narrow down a list of Must Read Outdoor Blogs? But to be honest its hard to narrow it down. So I thought I would ask you all:

What are your Must Read Outdoor Blogs? The blogs that you never want to miss a post because its always something of great interest and quality? I'm not interested in who has the most followers or the best industry connections. I'm interested in what you enjoy reading the most. Please take the time to submit the URL of your must read outdoor blogs in the comments below.

Then tell me what makes a great outdoor blog:

Texas Fires Devastating The State - Bastrop State Park Damaged by Fire - Extreme Drought






Another round of Texas wildfires have sparked up over the last couple of weeks. It seems the continued drought and high winds have caused some devastating results. According to the Texas Forest Service Firefightters have responded to over 305 different wildfires in the last seven days. Among those fires nearly 700 homes have been destroyed in past 48 hours. (Update @10:30 am 9/8/11: Bastrop Fire has destroyed 1,400 homes) All but Three of the 254 Texas Counties are under burn bans due to extreme fire conditions.

According to the Texas State Governor's office, local and state firefighters have responded to more than 20,900 fires since the beginning of wildfire season. Those fires have destroyed more than 1,000 homes and burned more than 3.6 million acres.

Now I understand that Bastrop State Park, 30 miles southeast of Austin, has been hit by fire. Most of the park has burned...only 100 of the 6,000 acres in park remain untouched. Bastrop State Park is  home to an isolated forest of Lobolly pines, often called the Lost Pines. It is unsure at this time weather or not the forest will survive the damage.

Nearby Buescher State Park is closed but remains unharmed as of this date. Other Texas State Parks in the area including Palmetto State Park and Monument Hill State Historic Site remain open at this time.

Texas Governor Rick Perry put out this statement:
The wildfire situation in Texas is severe and all necessary state resources are being made available to protect lives and property. I urge Texans to take extreme caution as we continue to see the devastating effects of sweeping wildfires impacting both rural and urban areas of the state. Our thoughts and prayers are with the first responders who are working around the clock to keep Texans out of harm's way, and with the families across our state who are threatened by these wildfires."

I have lived in Texas my entire life...I have never seen, nor heard of fires being this bad. We are in desperate need of rain. Our lakes and reservoirs are at critical lows. To the point that it is effecting municipal water supply. Texas is a large state and we need even larger rains to quench the earth and refill our lakes. Please pray for rain in Texas.

Sale on Nemo Tents at the Clymb






The Clymb is currently having a sale on Nemo Tents. I saw a Nemo tent in person for the first time recently in Glacier. I must admit I am impressed with the quality. Wish I had the extra money to spend on one at the Clymb today. Looks like these tents are selling for up to 60% off with a little less then two days left on the sale. If your interested you should go check it out for yourself.



I wrote a review on the Clymb after purchasing a couple of products and returning one. Click here if you want to see what I discovered.

Brown Pass and Hole in the Wall - Glacier National Park






This is day three of our five day backpack through Glacier National Park. Click here to read day two, Or here to read day one.

We have lost the trail, it has started to rain, and the mosquitos are the worst I have ever seen. My wife and I whip out our rain gear, but not for protection from the rain....to deter the relentless mosquitos. We are standing out in the wide open, hoping the rain will drive them away. But It doesn't. I give my head net to my wife and search franticly for the other one. But with my hands busy digging in my pack I have nothing to defend my head. I can literally see the mosquitos biting my face. And without the second head net...my only escape is to hike faster then they can fly. But thats the other problem...we don’t know where the trail is.



Bowman Creek
When we left Lake Francis that morning I had no idea the kind of day we were in for. I had expected to view spectacular scenery...and Glacier National Park did not disappoint. But that scenery would come at a price. Our third day in the Backcountry would be our hardest day yet. The most elevation change and the longest hike of our entire trip. 

But we weren't worried, it was still early and Thunderbird pond had us mesmerized. In Texas the word pond conjures a much different mental image. I half expected a small, stagnant, mirky watering tank. But Thunderbird pond is the complete opposite. I turn to our guide and say “this is a pond?” He just smiles and asks if he can take our picture. 



Thunderbird Pond and Thunderbird Falls


My wife and I at Thunderbird Pond
The day has warmed up fast and the water is so inviting both my wife and I think about swimming. But there is no time...we have a long way to go today. We push on ahead and begin to switchback up toward 6255 foot Brown Pass. And as we climb higher we catch glimpses of Dixon and Thunderbird Glacier feeding two gigantic waterfalls. One thing is for sure...the further we hike...the prettier it gets. But even these begin to disappear behind the ridge as we near the top of the pass and the Continental Divide.



My wife thinks about jumping in Thunderbird Pond.


Looking back at Dixon Glacier


Heading up toward Brown Pass
At the top our Guide gives us a choice. We have made good time, so if we would like we can take a mile or two detour toward Hole in the Wall. I look to my wife. For the last couple of days she has been nursing two heel blisters which only seem to be getting worse. Every step brings pain and we have only come about a third of our journey today.

Our guide tells us there is some spectacular views to be seen and we may never get the chance again. “Its up to you” he says “but to me thats the reason you're here.” He’s right and my wife knows it. Her heels may hurt but this could be a once in a lifetime opportunity. 

We head off to the northwest across a large snow field. My wife’s blisters are slowing us down and our guide is having trouble keeping our pace. He knows better than all of us the time constraints we are in so he stops and offers to stay with our packs. At first I resist...I’m not used to hiking with a guide and I feel bad leaving him there to babysit. But he assures us it is his job and that he has seen it all before. So we head off toward Hole in the Wall grateful to be hiking without the packs. 



A snow field along the Boulder Pass Trail


My wife's heel blister. Taken 5 days after this trip
Before long Bowman lake comes into view down at the bottom of the valley. Bowman lake is were we will camp tonight. It looks so far away and is almost discouraging. I know its not as far as it looks...but my wife sees something different...giant blisters. Its going to be a long way down. But right now the task at hand is getting a glimpse of Hole in the Wall. We continue around the ridge until the spectacular waterfalls come into view. Part of me wishes we were headed this way over Boulder Pass. But the Hole In The Wall campsite is closed under lingering snow. It's one of the reasons why we are headed to Bowman instead. We sit on the edge of the trail and gaze down into the deep ravine before us. At least a dozen waterfalls our in our immediate view including Hole In The Wall which is a waterfall that originates out of a small hole in the cliff face.

Approaching Hole in the Wall. You can barely see it in this photo.


Hole in the Wall is on the Left.


A better angle further down the trail. Hole in the Wall is on the left
It is so pretty here I think I could sit here all day. But my body is telling me its time to keep moving. It’s nearing lunch time and all our food is in our packs back with our guide. Plus a storm is coming in over Boulder Pass so we decide it was time to head back. We are glad we came. The extra miles were well worth the view.  We rejoin our Guide and eat another round of cheese, crackers, and beef jerky before heading back to Brown Pass. 



Looking down on Brown Pass. The large snow field in the middle of the pass is the remains of a large avalanche. 
At the Bowman Lake Trail junction we lose the trail altogether. Sometime last winter a huge avalanche came through the area completely demolishing the trail and the Brown Pass Campsite. A huge pile of snow, downed trees, and other debris covers this part of the trail. We at least know which direction to head but are forced to zig zag through a relentless maze of downed trees. Unsure which way to go we take a higher path and realize quickly that the trail is down below the ridge. We stop to assess our position when it starts to rain. We drop the packs under a couple of large trees as our guide heads off down the ridge to see if he can find a way back to the trail. My wife and I stay with the packs and before long the mosquitos find us. Or should I say attack us.



Hiking across avalanche debris toward were we think the trail is.



Still negotiating the Avalanche Field. This is the last picture I took of the Avalanche debris. It became too difficult after this to worry about taking pictures.
I have never seen mosquitos quite this bad. I look over at the back of my wife’s shirt which is covered in literally hundreds of mosquitos. With one swat I easily kill 2-3 dozen.   I never find the other head net and I can’t hike to get away. I have no choice but to stand in the rain swatting at mosquitos till our guide gets back. When he finally rejoins us the mosquitos find him as well. Fresh meat. Later he tells us that was the worst he had ever seen. I don’t know why but for some reason it makes me feel better. 



My shoulder covered in Mosquito bites. I received these bites through my shirt. 
in the mean time he has found the trail but its not going to be easy to get back to. We drop down below the steep ridge through some thick Huckleberry Bushes. the terrain is so steep we have to sit and slide down on our butts while gripping the Huckleberry Bushes to slow our decent. We are still dealing with the effects of the avalanche. Climbing up over and sometimes under countless downed trees. But then we see the demolished pit toilet of the Brown Pass backcountry campsite. With a little more looking we find a couple of tent pads and eventually the trail. A couple of hours have gone by and we have only moved about 1/8 mile. Its going to be a long day.

All the way down the ridge the mosquitos have followed us. But the good news is it has stopped raining. We stop to take off our rain gear which only invites the mosquitos to feast on the rest of our bodies. No matter...now that we have found the trail we have a chance of out-walking the mosquitos. “Let’s get moving” I say and before long we leave the mosquitos behind us. 



Heading down Bowman Valley


A random waterfall along the Bowman Lake Trail


Some Bear Grass along the Bowman lake trail.




Bear Grass. Each flower is a tiny Lily.
All the way down the valley the trail is surrounded by Cow Parsnip as tall as my shoulders. The rain is coming and going and as it does it soaks the Cow Parsnip, which eventually soaks my pants, which eventually runs down my legs into my boots. Within minutes everyone’s boots are soaked. But there is nothing to do but continue.



Some tall Cow Parsnip along the Bowman lake Trail


Looking back up toward Hole in the Wall.
As we near the bottom of the valley Bowman Creek braids itself across the trail in multiple spots. The first couple of crossings have easy logs stretched across to help us stay dry. But before long we reach a section with no easy way to cross. Our guide asks if we want to ford the creek or hike up and see if we can find a log to cross. I ask him what he would rather do. He chooses to find a log and we follow him through thick brush up the side of the creek. 



Bowman Creek
A short way up the creek he finds a rather thick log and starts out across it. But after a few steps he stops. The log has come to rest several feet above fast moving water and looks rather weak in the middle. Our guide isn’t a small guy and has a very heavy pack on (my guess would be close to 75 lbs, the dude was amazing). 

He yells out to me “you guys don’t have to do this.” 

I chuckle and respond “that log looks weak in the middle.” 

“I agree” he says “you want to go back and just ford the creek”

“Sounds like a plan, besides, my boots are already soaked.” 

We decide to take off our boots, however, and put on sandals. My boots might be wet but I see no point in dunking them in the creek, I do want them to dry out eventually. We cross the creek and sit down to put our boots back on. We have to repeat this several times as we cross different sections of Bowman creek. On our last crossing our guide and my wife cross on a narrow log. I follow them across but somehow manage to slip into fast moving water up to my thighs. I have my expensive DSLR around my neck which nearly meets its demise in the water. But I managed to gain my balance before it falls in. Now my boots are beyond soaked...I abandon the log and finish crossing through the creek.



Fording Bowman Creek
I look at our Guide and my wife. We are all tired, soaked and ready for camp. My wife is still dealing with bad blisters and wet boots have only made it worse. Camp seems like it will never come. But we keep on trekking and before long we arrive at Upper Bowman campsite. 



A fog comes in as we cross Bowman Creek for the last time.


Bowman Lake Trail
It is nearly dark when the rain lets up. Our guide and I decide to set up the tents before it starts again. I rush to get everything set up and then sit down on a log in utter exhaustion. Our guide looks over at me and asks: 

“You pooped?”

“yes”

“me too” he replies “It was a challenging day.”

“Yes” I say with a deep breath “but I somewhat enjoyed it.”

“yeah sometimes I like a good challenge.”

I think...me too...Thankful tomorrow will be an easy day.

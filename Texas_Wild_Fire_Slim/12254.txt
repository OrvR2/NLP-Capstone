It was announced Friday, July 1, that President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration covering 45 Texas counties during the period of April 6 to May 3. We’re grateful for the support of both the president and the governor, as well as all of our partners across the country that we’ve leaned on heavily throughout this devastating fire season. Since Nov. 15, 2010, more than 13,000 fires have burned 3.29 million acres of Texas land. The state remains under severe drought, and we expect to have active fires continue through the summer. No matter what happens, our plan has always been the same: To continue fighting fires and protecting Texans and their property. Gov. Rick Perry issued a statement following the president's announcement.

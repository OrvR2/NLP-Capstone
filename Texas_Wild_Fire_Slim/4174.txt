Emma Watson always keeps us guessing.
After flouncy feminine dresses and slick, menswear-inspired looks, the "Harry Potter" star showed up to the GQ Men Of The Year Awards at London's Royal Opera House wearing a punky get-up: a tartan plaid minidress by McQ, Alexander McQueen's diffusion line, and a shiny black moto jacket.
The tough look, however, was balanced out by delicate black pumps and that sleek pixie cut we've come to know and love.
What do you think of the look -- too tough around the edges for sweet Hermione?

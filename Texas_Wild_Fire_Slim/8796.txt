Home mortgage applications fall to 15-year lowBy DEREK KRAVITZ - AP Real Estate Writer | AP – Wed, Aug 24, 2011





WASHINGTON (AP) — Mortgage applications to purchase a home fell last week to a 15-year low, despite the lowest mortgage rates in decades.Many potential buyers are holding off because they are worried about job security and fear the economy could slip back into another recession.The Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday that an index measuring mortgage applications, which are adjusted for seasonal factors, fell 2.4 percent last week from the previous week. Home mortgage applications plunged 5.7 percent to its lowest level since December 1996."Another week of volatile markets and rampant uncertainty regarding the economy kept prospective homebuyers on the sidelines," said Mike Fratantoni, the trade group's vice president of research and economics.The share of mortgage applications used for refinancing has risen to nearly 80 percent of the market, up from 70 percent just three weeks ago.Few expect the lowest mortgage rates in decades to energize the depressed housing market. Over the past year, the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has been below 5 percent for all but two weeks. Last week, it hit a four-decade low of 4.15 percent.Yet sales remain unhealthy. Sales of new and previously occupied homes both fell in July. Sales of new homes are on pace to finish the year as the lowest on records dating back to 1963. The pace of re-sales is shaping up to be the worst in 14 years.Home prices haven't fared much better. Since the peak of the housing boom in 2007, homes have lost nearly a third of their value.The weak housing market has been a drag on the economy. And without more jobs, the housing market is unlikely to recover any time soon.Roughly 14 million Americans are unemployed. The economy created just 117,000 net jobs in July, barely enough to keep up with the population growth. It needs to generate twice as many to make a noticeable dent in the unemployment rate, which was 9.1 percent last month.The weekly survey covers more than half of all U.S. residential mortgage applications.

Ya, But we bailed out the banks. If the government told the banks to sell all the forecolsed houses and get all the excess out of the market it might start acting right. Untill housing  gets right the rest of the eco. will be in the pits.

Well we should lower rates even more! Oh, They are already at rock bottom. What will they try next? What mastermind in the Owebama administration that has never held a job or ran a business could possibly think of to help matters?
Nothing, that's what.
Vote them all out!

People should go on and invest if possible.  We are scared and have reason to be.  The job situation should change soon.  They honestly need to because they are responsible for the economy being the way it is.  They need to pony up or go out of business.  Those workers that are employed should take a stand, they must be working them to death so they won't have to hire anyone else.  Are you making overtime?  If not and you are promised big pay later think again.

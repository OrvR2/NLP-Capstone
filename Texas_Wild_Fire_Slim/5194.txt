Bachmann says she isn’t running to judge gaysBy Rachel Rose HartmanPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Rachel Rose Hartman | The Ticket – Mon, Aug 15, 2011

(Screenshot/NBC)One day after winning the Iowa straw poll, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann hedged on NBC's "Meet the Press" when host David Gregory asked about her past criticism of homosexuality.
Gregory played a 2004 clip of Bachmann addressing the National Education Conference when she stated that being gay is "a very sad life."
"It's part of Satan, I think, to say that this is 'gay.' It's anything but 'gay.'" She also stated that the gay lifestyle is "bondage" that leads to "personal enslavement of individuals" and is "dangerous." But she also encouraged compassion for those dealing with what she identifies as a "sexual dysfunction."
Gregory asked if these would be Bachmann's views on gays were she to win the presidency. But she dodged the question, saying "Well, I am running for the presidency of the United States. I am not running to be anyone's judge."
Gregory pressed Bachmann, suggesting that she has, in fact, judged gays. But the congresswoman defended herself, saying of gays "I don't judge them," and adding that she accords "honor and dignity" to every person.
She also avoided Gregory's questions regarding how she believes gay Americans will react to statements such as the ones she made in 2004 to the National Education Conference. She did not offer a direct answer when Gregory asked if she would appoint someone who is openly gay to her administration, cabinet or as a federal judge, saying her litmus test for appointees would be an assessment of their constitutional principles.
Bachmann stressed her opposition to gay marriage during the interview but would not offer an opinion of a family with two gay parents.
You can watch the exchange between Gregory and Bachmann, below via NBC:
 
Bachmann and her husband, Marcus Bachmann, run a Christian counseling business that offers "reparative" therapy for homosexuality, which backers believe can "cure" people of being gay. Marcus Bachmann stressed that the facility only offers "reparative" therapy if a client requests that type of treatment.
Bachmann's hedging Sunday demonstrates the careful line she will be walking during the 2012 campaign to extend her national appeal while continuing to try to amass support from the conservative right.

Bach-inhu-mann- Gays don’t Judge you either!  You  don't have to apologize for being a religious maniac that thinks like it’s the 1800s, you just needs to realize A) gays won’t vote for  you and B) women belong barefoot and pregnant and in the kitchen.
Sounds harsh, hah ?
NOT REALLY!  Tit for tat kids- What’s with this "let’s be tolerant of religion" (which is a lifestyle of CHOICE!!) mentality- it has been the bane of progress and society for  2,000 years paying special attention to all the tax money spent on the legal battles for gay rights and equality - while it is currently 2011 according to my calendar and Gays are still being thought of and treated like second class citizens in the United States with no glimpse of a FEDERAL amendment in sight. and YES it should be FEDERAL, anything less is an insult to freedom equality and democracy which is what USA *WAS* all about.( let’s look back on interracial marriage in the United states or the abolition of slavery. it’s not the 1800s and if you don’t like gay marriage, then don’t do it ! Gay people should also WAKE UP and stop paying TAXES in a mass protest since the government steals from the people it denies legal marriage to via TAXES since married heterosexuals are allotted tax breaks which homosexuals cannot enjoy. Once money Is involved all of a sudden the governments selective listening magically disappears. But that’s the problem of the homosexuals to get off their collective rumps and be a lot more constructive , PRO-ACTIVE and vocal as a group- this also means it’s not enough to “observe” what’s going wrong with gay rights, it’s your obligation to REACT.
In a free democratic society, Religion however should be taxed and then banned then outlawed as long as it maintains its ongoing crusade against homosexuals and homosexuality. – Since Hate Groups are to be investigated under the patriot act, this point is further underscored !
because it’s nothing but a hate group intolerance does not need to be tolerated. learn from history you evil beast
If "god" made "Adam and eve" you would all be a product of incest.- which any elementary biology teacher can tell you, after six generations would fail miserably.  (we won’t ask where Cain and Able fathered their children from, but in certain circles that’s considered SICK and it’s also illegal in all 50 states in USA)

this "Satanic" hate group needs to be stopped in its tracks,
now then does anybody think its “unfair” to call Christianity a satanic special rights hate  group ?
do you really?
What’s your reaction to saying that about gays, you can’t have it both ways kids! Grow up
These fringe groups are so ANTI-SOCIAL:
HOMOSEXUALS  ARE SOCIETY! And pay taxes - all be it unfairly as previously stated .
There needs to be an organization to offer “reparative therapy” to religious people, like the one Marcus Bach-inhumann is offering for gays.
C mon Americans don’t let me be the only one who has the intellectual capacity to think this far
The best defense is a good offense. Most of you only play defense. 
its already past too late, Now MOVE IT
These freaks have gone too far and too long – they are out of control.
The final question is why the media  even feeds these people in the first place
It’s been noted several times about the lack of  coverage for Ron Paul , yet we have “ gays are Satan”  Bach-inhu-mann all over the headlines.

    Religion  is a lifestyle of choice, and it’s also  a privilege which should be revoked if it’s used to abuse other people

(THIS IS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE OTHER DAY ABOUT "JUSTIFYING" THE DEATH OF HOMOSEXUALS FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND-TO SAVE THE WORLD)
God's law always weighs the punishment against the sin, e.g. 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth'. This does not mean if I knock your eye out you have a right to retaliate as you please. It rather means to abstain from a harsher punishment than the crime demands. Judge justly. In light of that, if God commanded a person to be lawfully stoned to death for a crime, I would posit that God considers the crime akin to murder. "Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?" (Gen. 18:25) It seems to me it begs the age old question of when does life begin? The life is in the seed; that no one can deny and therefore to destroy the seed is to destroy life.

Genesis 35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
Life is a sacred blessing; children are a heritage of the LORD. Instead of celebrating and propagating life, same gender relationships destroy the very seed, sanctity and value of life. The lifestyle is a mockery of Gods' intents and purposes of marriage between a man and a woman. I believe it was the design of Satan to halt the line and lineage of the Messiah as well. He hates mankind who is made in the very image of God and undoubtedly delights in the destruction of man (even the seed). Just like a crop, if you destroy the seed there is no fruit to harvest. God's own design of family hierarchy and relationship suffers greatly as a result of such conduct. It has well been noted that as the family goes, so goes the nation; as goes the nation, so goes the world.

As far as it being an act of murder to put such ones to death (in the Old Testament), I think it would have been more likened to someone on death row and those whose job it was to carry out the sentence. They were essentially doing their duty to protect (defense of life) the community of innocent, law abiding citizens. To have let those akin to murderers live on would have further endangered innocent lives as well as obstructing the Messianic lineage. 
Genesis 9:6-7 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein:
Ecclesiastes 8:11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
Speedily carrying out a sentence is a sure deterrent to those who might be swift to engage in the same sin.

Bill Keller, The New York Times outgoing executive editor, stirred the pot this morning with a column raising concerns about the religious allegiances of the Republican presidential candidates. Whether it's Rick Perry's affiliation with "Dominionists" or Michele Bachmann's "literal" interpretation of the Bible, he'd like the candidates to open up about how exactly their religious beliefs will guide their actions in office. "I care a lot if a candidate is going to be a Trojan horse for a sect that believes it has divine instructions on how we should be governed." Flagging some specific candidates, he notes that "Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum are all affiliated with fervid subsets of evangelical Christianity, which has raised concerns about their respect for the separation of church and state, not to mention the separation of fact and fiction." Getting the ball rolling, he sent each candidate a list of general and specific questions (the general ones are listed below):

    •Do you agree with those religious leaders who say that America is a “Christian nation” or a “Judeo-Christian nation?” and what does that mean in practice?

    •Would you have any hesitation about appointing a Muslim to the federal bench? What about an atheist?

    •What is your attitude toward the theory of evolution, and do you believe it should be taught in public schools?

To the Bachmans and all who choose to love and obey GOD...instead of choosing to be popular with the world: (JESUS speaking)...Matthew 5:11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. 12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

Long story short, there is alot more on the table here folks than the Gay issue, in fact that is the least of my concerns at the moment. Bachman is a dush as is the majority of the candidates out there. Time to put personal issues aside and stand as a group of Americans. Dont let yourself get sidetracked by minor issues as compared to the major ones and this is a minor one to the mainstream public, sorry.

Religion is not based on any fact or science.  Nobody's religion has been proven to be correct.  Its all a matter of Faith.  This is why there is such disagreement around religion-- NOBODY has real evidence-- they all just hand waive around what they have faith in.
This includes the Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Hindus--- they all hand wave.

Religion has no part in the US government.  This is written in the constitution.  Making a matter of faith part of a campaign is just preying on the naive and uneducated who have nothing other than faith and are just looking for someone who agrees with them on a matter that can't be decided on the basis of fact.  Its taking advantage of them and exploiting them, and helping them get out of their responsibility as US citizens to evaluate the facts and make a choice based upon them. Its keeping them from learning about the world around them.

So let Michelle exploit the naivete of the religious right wing.  It'll keep them from doing something productive to advance their agenda.

It is unbelievable that such raging maniacs are the top runners in the Republican party. Even a criminal like Richard Nixon could pronounce "Nuclear." Michele Backman thinks we are still fighting the "Soviet Union" 20 years after its gone and Perry is running on global warming and evolution God when its clearly the economy as the important issue. Where is Dwight Eisenhower for a little sanity in a party gone completely nuts!

Four decades ago, the issue was race. now it is sexual orientation.  Bachmann is no better than the KKK of the old south.
It is OK to be Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual or Transgender. Get over it Republicans.

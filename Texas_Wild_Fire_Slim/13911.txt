BASTROP, Texas (AP) — One of the most destructive wildfires in Texas history is slowing down thanks in part to calming winds, but stretched-thin firefighting crews have yet to gain any control of the blaze that is plowing across rain-starved grasslands now littered with hundreds of charred homes.Raging with zero containment for days, the wind-fueled fire has destroyed more than 600 homes and blackened about 45 square miles in and around Bastrop, a city near Austin. An elite search team on Wednesday will begin looking for more possible victims of the fire, which has killed two people and forced thousands to evacuate.Crews finally got a reprieve Tuesday from winds pushed in by Tropical Storm Lee that whipped the blaze into an inferno over the weekend. Increased humidity was moving in overnight, and officials were expected to report some containment in the morning, Texas Forest Service spokesman John Nichols said."Tonight should be a good night, tomorrow should be a good day — we hope," Nichols said late Tuesday. "The reason why it hasn't been able to be contained is the wind. We still have a lot of active fire on the line, but today was the first day we had very light wind."The blaze is the most catastrophic of the more than 180 fires that have erupted in the past week across Texas, marking one of the most devastating wildfire outbreaks in state history. The fires have destroyed more than 1,000 homes, caused four deaths and pulled the state's firefighting ranks to the limit.In a housing development near Bastrop, Willie Clements' two-story colonial home was reduced to a heap of metal roofing and ash. A picket fence was melted. Some goats and turkeys survived, but about 20 chickens and ducks died in a coop that went up in flames."We lost everything," said Clements, who with his family took a picture of themselves in front of a windmill adorned with a charred red, white and blue sign that proclaimed, "United We Stand.""This is the beginning of our new family album," the 51-year-old said.Texas Gov. Rick Perry cut short a high-profile presidential campaign trip to South Carolina to deal with the crisis, and on Tuesday toured a blackened area near Bastrop, about 25 miles from Austin. He later deployed Texas Task Force 1, the same search team sent to New York following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina."Pretty powerful visuals of individuals who lost everything," Perry said after the tour. "The magnitude of these losses are pretty stunning."The conservative Republican said he expects federal assistance with the wildfires but complained that red tape was keeping available bulldozers and other heavy equipment at the Army's Fort Hood, about 75 miles from Bastrop. The post was fighting its own 3,700-acre blaze.White House spokesman Jay Carney said the Obama administration has approved seven federal grants to help Texas with the latest wildfires.About 1,200 firefighters battled the blazes, including crews from as far away as California and Oregon. Five heavy tanker planes, some from the federal government, and three aircraft capable of scooping 1,500 gallons of lake water at a time also helped.The disaster is blamed largely on Texas' yearlong drought, one of the most severe dry spells the state has ever seen. The fire in Bastrop County is the most devastating wildfire in Texas in more than a decade, eclipsing a blaze that destroyed 168 homes in North Texas in April.At least 11 other fires exceeded 1,000 acres Tuesday, including an 8,000-acre blaze that destroyed at least six homes in Caldwell County, next to Bastrop County. In far northeast Texas' Cass County, a 7,000-acre fire burned in heavy timberland. And in Grimes County, about 40 miles northwest of Houston, a 3,000-acre fire destroyed nearly two dozen homes and threatened hundreds more.In at least one neighborhood in Bastrop, flames hop-scotched a street where houses were tucked among oaks, pines and cedar trees. The Postal Service delivered mail to burned homes where only mailboxes were left standing.John Chapman's home on about 20 acres was only singed and had some smoke damage, but the vintage-car collector lost about 175 vehicles he kept in a garage or under pole barns. His losses included about a dozen Corvettes and a Shelby Cobra.As ashes swirled and tree stumps still spit flames, the 70-year-old Chapman pointed out the melted remains of a 1966 Pontiac GTO, a '57 Chevrolet pickup and a 1947 Studebaker pickup, and said: "You can either laugh or you can cry. You might as well laugh.""The house is safe, my wife and I are alive and good, and I'm not going to worry about it," he said.About 40 people who fled their homes were staying at a community center in the town of Paige. A volunteer, Debbie Barrington, said some people have been sleeping outside on picnic tables under a pavilion, eating food and using toiletries donated by folks not hurt by the fires."The first night, we had a child 17 months old," she said. "We didn't have milk. The next morning, I think we had eight gallons. People heard what we needed and brought it in. The response has been unreal."___Michael Graczyk reported from Houston.

Some who say that Christians,                                                      (as well as government), should be giving handouts to everyone.  Giving is good,'enabling' is not ! There are those who do not wish to work, (different from those who are not able or who can't find work), but would rather live off the governments systems & thus You, and it  fuels their voting preferences, not what is good for America as a whole.
Ezekiel 33:31 My people come to you, as they usually do, and sit before you to listen to your words, but they do not put them into practice.  With their mouths they express devotion, but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain.    
Proverbs 6:10-11 A little extra sleep, a little more slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest-- then poverty will pounce on you like 
a bandit; scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.

Perry's home state of Texas releases more heat-trapping pollution carbon dioxide — the chief greenhouse gas — than any other state in the country, according to government data.
Perry cut fire prevention by 4 million dollars and he cut the firefighters by 70%.
PHk Perry, the Bush family , and all you t-bagging idiots. 
You yell and scream for indipendence from the US and now you stand there with your hand out for federal aid.
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
help us Obama
WAAAAAAAAAAA
What a bunch of hypocrites.
And seeing how your invisable "skydaddy" didn't hear your prayers, why don't you try and get some of that oil money those fat cats there are squeezing you for?
I say pHK texass, let it burn.

The line 'The post office delivered mail to burned homes where only mail boxes were left standing' clearly illustrates why that organization is soon to be a charred wreck, as well.

I forgot to thank God for giving us our Great Leaders like the WORD says he does... thank you for Mullah Dubya Bush, Cult of Personality Obama, and our future male cheerleader president Ayatollah Perry. Thank you lord for putting your best men in charge just as you promise to in your sacred divine holy bible that there are only a few thousand different versions of.

In the past when the global warming issue was discussed they said average 1 or 2 degree increase in temperature of globe is not a big deal, I wrote down that not through the globe it will be an even 1 or 2 degree increase but in some places 20 t0 25 degree increase some places 1 to 2, some places 3- to 5, and some places almost no increase in temperatures.. so the places that increase over 10 to 15 degrees will have huge changes.. Thus not needed to be ignored.. but most people ignored and continue their habits...

This much fire shows these fires were produced by professionals who were laid off as a result of lack of fires..!! They must search if any ex-forestry or ex-fire fighters who were laid off involved in producing these fires..!!

wonder how Backpedalin' Bachmann is going to get out from under her insults to Texas with her "God communicates through terrible weather and disaters" pronouncement.

she may actually be a bigger idiot than Failin Palin the Half a Gov... hard to believe there are two of them atop the heap.

i guess it just proves that when your head is full of hot air, you too can rise to the top of the RTardican TeaBagger heap.

Hey Joe!
We offer our condolences to these good families here in Georgia too!
If someone doesn't break the law, as we've seen and heard on the news lately from many parts of the U.S., how employees of funding orgs have embezzled money, etc. from volunteers who have tried to donate money to helping out our fellow citizens, we'll all be "chipping in" as much as we can gather to help our fellow Americans in Texas who lost their homes and everything they own to the wildfires.
As the Clement family's uncharred red,white, and blue signpost reads, "UNITED WE STAND" and in the week of 9/11, we need to get behind them, because that's what America has always stood for and always will!
Everybody, let's get our butts over to our local bank, Red Cross, or Chamber of Commerce......and start ante up! Even a few bucks goes a long way, and a few coins adds up quick too!

Hey DITTO wake up and smell the coffee the truth is the world is going to shit and touchy feely sentiments are not going to change that. The truth is always a bummer for those who have their heads up their uknowhat. Whats the point of feeling sorry after the fact when we should be doing something to stop this happening in the first place or are just a bunch of sheep waiting for our turn to be butchered?

Perry left the campaign trail hence the source of the great  wind ceased immediately. Texas has a reprieve till  the '  Great Gasby '  returns to the campaign trail. The  giant windbag prayed to God for rain, God saw the man behind the prayer and He burned Texas  to the ground !

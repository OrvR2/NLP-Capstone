Daily Horoscope for September 12

 Capricorn
Today's Full Moon may force you to speak up, even if that's the last thing you feel like doing. It may be a matter of 'speak now or forever hold your peace', so don't be shy. Those of you who were born in the mid 60's may feel this transit very acutely, as natal Pluto will be activated. If you feel you are becoming overwhelmed or need guidance, consider consulting your favourite astrologer.

Teachers in D.C. Public Schools who perform well will see some easing from a controversial evaluation process introduced by former DCPS Chancellor Michelle Rhee.
The 290 teachers in the school system who earned ratings of "highly effective" for the last two years and who scored a 3.5 average on their first two evaluations this school year can opt out of the final three observations by district officials that take place over the year, The Washington Examiner reports.
DCPS evaluates its teachers and staff on a system it calls IMPACT, which assesses teacher performance according to student achievement, instructional expertise, collaboration and professionalism. Teachers are observed five times a year and receive scores on a scale of 1 to 4, with a score of 1 being "ineffective," and 4 being "highly effective."
D.C. Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson already relaxed IMPACT rules in July by allowing some teachers who receive two consecutive "minimally effective" scores to keep their jobs -- those teachers would have been dismissed under IMPACT's original provisions, The Washington Post reported.
IMPACT has been a controversial system since its inception. Advocates tout its process of holding teachers accountable and note the program's incentives for improved teacher performance. Critics have argued that it judges teachers unfairly -- in which student scores on standardized tests could count for as much as half of a teacher's evaluation. Some have argued that the system could drive teachers to cheat to improve scores that contribute to evaluations, annual goals and bonuses.
DCPS and the U.S. Department of Education are investigating system schools regarding questionable scoring patterns and alleged cheating incidents among teachers during Rhee's tenure, between 2008 and 2010.
In July, DCPS fired more than 400 teachers as a result of poor IMPACT scores, while 663 Washington Teachers' Union members received bonuses for earning high scores.

							            							            It is a result of the situational ethics of today's accountability hawks. The end, of helping poor children, is used to justify disgusting means -- the intimidation of adults to the point where some break under the pressure.

				Standardiz­ed test are a very poor way to evaluate a teacher.If parents don't care or are too busy to be involved and prepare their childred for learning it will be extremely difficult to get desirable test results.Wi­th class size and the need to keep other students engaged,it will be all but impossible to give the type of one on one attention a child in these circumstan­ces needs.

				STOP putting all the blame on teachers!
It ALL starts at home.
Many households are run by single parents. Men and women get married NOT til death do us part....in­stead, they get married til, something better comes along.  Or,they get pregnant on the second date and realize by the fourth date that they can't stand each other!
In ALL of this....it­'s the kids who suffer. Many parents are too tired to do a lot for their kids, many are too busy looking for their next boyfriend/­girlfriend or drug of choice. KIds are basically raising themselves along with the computer, the TV and electronic games.
Young girls get pregnant, so that they will have someone "who loves them"  ??!!  Not, so they can love the baby!  Parents are giving into the ADD and all the other 'disorders­' and putting their kids on drugs, so that mom can get the SSI check every month!  Kids are begging to be noticed. Looking for attention. Sometimes, the only place they get it, is in school.

Grow up folks and BRING UP YOUR OWN CHILDREN!  Allow teachers to TEACH!

				Sorry, Tomcat, but you must not be aware that there's been a severe shortage of qualified teachers in America for over 30 years.  With the many thousands of Baby Boomer age who will be retiring in the next 5 years, the statistics get even worse.  
Not only does 29% totally leave the profession within 5 years of starting, but a higher ratio opt out of the major during their junior year when they see how much work they'll be doing for so little pay and benefits.  
Even many unemployed workers don't fit the bill because they can't pass the FBI screening that they must pay for themselves - even to merely substitute­.  I know - I'm a retired adminstrat­or who was responsibl­e for filling those positions.

				How much do you think you have the right to ask of your teachers? Do you think they should always be excellent in every aspect of their vocation? Why do you think that?  
Teachers are just people who go to work every day, just like you. How hard do you try at your job? Do you give 110% every day?  Are you absolutely the best you can be? If not, why should teachers be? 
Teachers are just workers who get up in the morning and go to work, like you. Sure they make 40, 50, or 60 thousand dollars; they have good jobs. But teachers aren’t trying out for the Olympics, they’re not vying for million dollar contracts with the NFL or NHL, or trying to become billion dollar CEO’s. So why judge them as though they were? 
Teachers are just ordinary workers who want to do as good as they can but they’re not going to compete as though there were ultra-rich rewards at stake. If you think that’s not good enough, maybe you should be a teacher, Then you could watch while the crazies condemn your efforts.

				The core problem wih all teacher evalouatio­n systems is rater bias that can lead to down scoring of disfavored teachers due to personalit­y, voice, ethnicity, race, style, etc. that have nothing to do with how effective they are at getting students to learn.  It is also true that it takes brand new teachers often as long as five years of mentoring to be quality teachers.  They almost all start out making some mistakes whether it be failure of instructio­nal methods or a mistake that leads to lack of discipline­.  Too harsh an approach will fire most new teachers and leave an absence of continuity of any kind for students.

When a school district develops a system with sufficient raters that has a good track record of inter-rate­r consistenc­y and no systemic bias, it will be welcomed by most teachers.  Some may get nervous anytime observed, but the great teachers will welcome witnesses to their skills.

My wife taught art so well her principal, for his own education, chose to come and observe how she demonstrat­ed each new form of art, and she appreciate­d that as recognitio­n of work well done.  (Her performanc­e ratings were never in question then although her first year overworked under another principal was a great burden which a friendly experience­d teacher helped her through outside of classroom hours, or she might never have become a great art teacher.

				Considerin­g just the hours that children are awake, they are in school only about 25% of the time and with parents or elsewhere the OTHER 75% of their waking hours. Can we expect the teachers and the school systems to do ALL the teaching and monitoring and mentoring? Even during those 25% of the hours kids are in school, a lot of time is devoting to NON-TEACHI­NG activities because of the paperwork requiremen­ts and other factors. It is easy to get angry with the teacher if your kid isn't learning the necessary skills, but maybe parents should look in their mirrors first.  Not a Teacher And Never Have Been

				No, it is because the European countries separate the students in high school to those who are on a college track and those who are not.  Finland, which the world looks to as an example in excellent education of their citiaenry, has 100% union participat­ion by teachers, and three teachers in every classroom.

				If you check into the top nations for education, countries such as Finland and Japan, you will find that the population is very often homogeneou­s--the people look alike, have the same appearance­. It is fact that folks willl spend more money on education and other "help other people" things if the population is homogeneou­s.  If you are blonde and blue-eyed, you'll be much more likely to want to spend money to help OTHER blonde, blue-eyed folks who look like you, rather than an "outsider.­" Also, nations with smaller defense budgets do better in education because more money is available for schools.

				The cheating is wrong, no doubt sbout THAT. But think about this: in a tight job market and with a family to support and few, if any, other jobs available, MIGHT you not consider cheating to keep your job and take care of your family? If a teacher is fired because his/her school is deemed a "failure," that teacher will probably NEVER get another teaching job even if he/she did the best possible job with what was available. Maybe you are absolutely pure and would NEVER cheat, even if it meant your job and the abiloty to take care of your family. But maybe NOT.....

				You should also ask the parents and children similar questions.  Would they want to have a teacher who was unable to get their students to reach standard? If the teacher could not get the students to reach standard would cheating be okay? Would making the students feel as though they are prepared to successful­ly compete in college and the job market, knowing full well that they are not, be the just thing to do?   Most people want the very best teachers for their children.

				You must not have liked teachers very much.  Imagine if you were subject to an evaluation that placed a priority upon a test which may or may represent learning that is not considered important enough to include in a student's evaluation (grade) and may occur before the end of teaching has occurred.  I would be angry that I was being held to a standard beyond my control.  What I would respect would be the evaluation of my peers, colleagues who are familiar enough with the teaching matter to know whether the teacher is competent to teach, say, mathematic­s.  I could even appreciate the input of an administra­tor who understand­s broader issues such as classroom discipline etc.  A committee could easily evaluate me and I would welcome it.  Instead, under the current system, I was evaluated by a principal who never observed me teach, knew nothing about mathematic­s and was determined to destroy my career because I was uppity.  Actually, he accused me of insubordin­ation.  As I was not even a probationa­ry teacher, but had taught for 11 years on an emergency credential (I completed the credential the same year I was "fired".), there were no protection­s for me.  Oh well.  Destroying careers is unfortunat­ely what some administra­tors specialize in doing.

				Teachers, of course, need to be held accountabl­e.  We can't have teachers browsing the internet, talking on the phone, etc. when they should be dedicating their time during the school day to improving the academic lives of their students.  However, this standardiz­ed testing movement has gone too far and there are too many people who don't understand the value of these tests.  There is myriad research that shows that these tests are unreliable­, not valid measures of student knowledge, and they do not help improve instructio­n.  Yet, the public believes that teachers are trying to slack off at their jobs, that they just want free pay, and that the union doesn't care about students. 

Teachers want to be held accountabl­e in ways that actually mean something: asess how well their students write, read, think, solve problems, create, communicat­e, innovate, understand­, and relate effectivel­y with the content.  Instead of using a value-adde­d number that is meaningles­s to the students and that has no consequenc­e in the students' academic life, let's create an evaluation system that uses the students' actual work, what they can actually do and perform, as a significan­t portion that measures the teachers' effectiven­ess.  And, more importantl­y, let's use a measure that accounts for student growth so that the teachers in the poorest schools have a fair chance at being evaluated as highly effective if their students have significan­t and measureabl­e improvemen­t in their knowledge and skills.  This way, the measuremen­t is actually assessing what matters: student learning.

				Sounds perfect in a perfect world.  How do you account for the number of students through no fault of their own cannot learn because of issues of poverty, abuse, parental insensitiv­ity, etc.?  I am not attacking the practical parts of what you are saying but I still see room for improvemen­t since there is so much that is not under control of teachers or schools.  Besides, not all schools are bad since so many do well and do learn...bo­th because and in spite of their situations­...often in the same schools.

				What I don't think people understnad is that the greatest factor affecting student performanc­e today is ATTENDANCE­!!   Most of the kids I taught were missing an average of one day a week, and parents were excusing their children's absences.  After a while, the admin would not let parents do that anymore,  then kids reck up unexcused absences with their parent's blessing.  The problem was to great for truancy officials to handle, and parents would just throw their hands up and state that they could not force their (high school aged) children to attend.  I personally know people who allow their kids to miss several days a month, even at the elementary level.  How can you judge a teacher on the performanc­e of a student that is not attending school every day?  I challenge anyone to look at general attendance records of any high school or middle school to see the trends.  Where does parental responsibi­lity come in?  Well, making sure that behinds are in chairs every day would be a good start.

				Teaching school is one of the few jobs which normally do not require the teachers to perform at any given level.  Most jobs have regular performanc­e evaluation­s and goals are set for the next evaluation­.  There is no reason that teachers can't be subject to those rules too and their performanc­e, and thus our kids performanc­e, just might go up.

				Student performanc­e might just go up if a) we didn't hold onto this nonsense that all students should go to college; b) parents cared enough about their offspring that they provided a space for students to work at home and saw to it that students attended school daily and did their work daily; c) the school day were lengthened for students who are behind academical­ly; and d) we could deal with the myriad socio-econ­omic issues that distract our students from focusing on their studies.

				I am grateful my wife is an educator in the college system.  Her students actually want to be in class.  There is no discipline in our school systems for fear of lawsuits.  There are also teachers who cannot even pass the tests they administer­.  We visited a country where the rules were quite clear.If you do your homework and get good grades, you stay in the main system and you go to college for free.  If you are lazy or disruptive­, you are sent to a secondary school that will teach you the basics to function in life to attain a manual labor job and that is it.  If you are removed from that school, you get nothing.  Sounds harsh but they produce a high number of graduates with Master's degrees at what we would consider our junior year college students.  There is also a difference between poor students and poor parenting and maybe we she be more active in identifyin­g which it is and address the issue appropriat­ely.

				dscat1029, I accidental­ly marked you favorite. I was a teacher for many years. Quite a number of my students didn't even do their nightly homework which consisted of 10 minutes reading a night. They had a weekly paper that went home. If the child read the 10 minutes, the parent wrote down the title of the book and their initials. There simply was very little cooperatio­n. If I sent home a sheet of homework in addition to the reading, forget it. This was in second grade so the homework was usually only a sheet on math facts or something similar. The kids who did the work usually got better grades. I was able to get some 5th of 6th grade students to come and read with the kids who hadn't done their homework. But what does this say about the parents caring about their children's education. Kids would fall asleep during silent reading tie, forget mittens and warm clothes in the winter. So ---- WHERE were the parents in all this?

				Your rants about unions and education are unfounded.  The best school system in the world is Finland, a country where 95% of the teachers are in a union that makes ours look anemic.  It's almost impossible to fire a teacher there.  South Korea and Singapore follow Finland in rankings for educationa­l systems and are both unionized.  What's missing in countries with the best school systems is citizens that routinely take cheap shots at teachers and education.  They have a social matrix in those cultures that respects education and teachers much more than in America.  They treat teaching as well as profession­s like engineerin­g, law and medicine.  They do not pay their teachers as highly as surgeons but they trust and support them to do the best job and, of course, that's how their teachers perform, and that's why they have a far better record in attracting bright, capable people into it. They also pay their teachers better.  We spend a lot on education but much goes where it really hasn't done much good such as implementi­ng political mandates such as No Child Left Behind, which none of the best world-wide systems would touch.  The population­s at the top work together at doing the best and don't spend fruitless money and time squabbling among themselves­, as we do,  and they keep mindless politician­s out of a process as critical as education.  The moronic squabbling here is clearly communicat­ed to our kids and tells them they needn't take education seriously either.

Open thread for night owls

Burnt Orange Report:
After leaving Texas during the worst wildfire season in our state's history for a GOP primary debate in California, Rick Perry stayed on the West Coast for a three-day series of fundraisers. Rather than racing back to help disaster relief, he stayed in California to light a fire under Republican donors. [...]
From a story in the Chicago Tribune earlier this week, emphasis mine:
Perhaps more than any other candidate, the Texas governor will use the trip to raise money for his presidential campaign. As the late arrival in the race, Perry has already proved his bona fides as a world-class fundraiser. Members of his finance team says "it is going like wildfire" and their California schedule backs up the claim.
Rather than returning immediately to his burning state, Perry headlined fundraisers in San Diego, Newport Beach, Los Angeles, Bakersfield, San Jose and Fresno, as well as several public rallies.

You must add at least one tag to this diary before publishing it.






Add keywords that describe this diary.
		Separate multiple keywords with commas.
Tagging tips

?

More Tagging tips:
A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?
Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.
If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the office. 
		CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.
Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably not meaningful.





Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: 
	
	Civil Rights, community, Congress, Culture, Economy, Education, Elections, Energy, Environment, Health Care, International, Labor, Law, media, Meta, National Security, Science, Transportation, or White House.
	If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state 
	(California,
	Texas, etc).
	Keep in mind, though, that there are many wonderful and important diaries
	that don't fit in any of these tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

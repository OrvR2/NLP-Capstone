For every destroyed McMansion shown on the news, there are 100 apartment buildings, tract homes, or mobile homes where the regular people live as best they can.  In the "resort" communities, the full time, year round residents are the hotel maids, cooks, repairmen, shopkeepers, the thousands of people that make a meager living.  They depend on the tourist trade that has been literaly blown away.
If you want to donate to this cause, or any number of humanitarian aid causes, a good group is UMCOR at http://new.gbgm-umc.org/umcor/ wheather you want to give money or actually go somewhere and help in person.  They're actually getting the aid to the people that need it, not just lining the pockets of the bureaucrats.  Pick the cause closest to your heart, and they will help you help the most.

The government just sent help to comrade Kim, North Korea via a 747.

Its nice to see people getting help, but what about the people on the streets being thrown out?

No matter what you've heard, you can still buy a home with no money down, and you can do it regardless of your credit or your income situation.

And I am supposed to feel sorry for these wealthy people in Virginia Beach that have beach front homes that got damaged?  I don't think I will be sending any money to help them anytime soon.  How much do you think a home on the sand is worth?  And they are built on stilts for a reason.  This type of damage should come as no surprise to anyone there or any of us who don't live there.  It is like showing a damaged building after an earthquake in California.  What a friggin surprise that is.

I just love how people in disasters get help, but people who have ended up in the streets or been thrown to the dogs(so to speak) by the business & corporate boys, get NO help, except unemployment & then some do not even get that. When the unemployment runs out, then what a%% H%les, into the streets like the rest that you consider throw away people. Try caring about others & maybe they will care about you. We're all in this together, aren't we AMERICA. P.S. Where's Mr Buffet now!!! Mr Gates, Mr Trump, ETC. Of course, heaven forbid that they fall off their stacks of cash to their deaths just to help us...

It is the duty of Obama and Congress to help and restore all damaged houses. They do not need any help because they waste billions and billions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world. At least provide free Medicare to all US citizens and free housing those who earn less than 50K.

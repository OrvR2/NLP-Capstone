StoryText SizeCops: Child Wanders Off While Mom ShopsSanford Police Say Mom Left Young Children Home AlonePOSTED: Monday, September 12, 2011UPDATED: 6:02 am EDT September 13, 2011 SANFORD, Fla. -- A Seminole County mother was arrested over the weekend on allegations of leaving her five children home alone.Latoya Hayes, 30, was arrested Saturday on child neglect charges after her oldest child, a 10-year-old mentally handicapped boy, was found wandering the neighborhood in just a diaper, according to police.The boy was spotted at Star Bright Laundry on Park Avenue in Sanford, a few blocks from his home on Myrtle Avenue, police said."I'm a loving mom. I needed to get chocolate milk so he could take his medicine," said Hayes, who was released from jail on bond.Police said Hayes left her children home alone Saturday morning for at least 30 minutes while she walked to the grocery store down the street.Hayes said when she left, her five children were sleeping. She has a 3-year-old, 4-year-old twins, a 5-year-old and the 10-year-old."I figured I could make it back before they woke up," Hayes told Local 6 News on Monday.But her oldest son walked out of the house to a Laundromat, where customers called police.Neighbors said it's not the first time the boy has walked out of the home alone."I remember her walking up here and asking if I saw a kid with a diaper run by, and I was kind of shocked," Bryc LaBlanc said Monday.Hayes admitted that her son has gotten out of the house before."This has happened plenty of times. The police come and I've never had to go to jail, so they surprised me," Hayes said.Hayes is a single mom and she said she has asked for help from child protective services before.  Now, she hopes it's not too late."Yes. I shouldn't have left them, but if you were in the same situation, you would have had to do what I did. I love my children and they love me, and I will get them back," Hayes said.The children have been removed from the home and placed with nearby family members.Hayes said her handicapped son is still in custody of child protective services.Hayes will face a judge Tuesday to determine if she will get her children back.

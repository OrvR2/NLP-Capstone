WASHINGTON - Whatever path Rick Perry had to a general election victory got narrower with each word the Texas governor spoke Wednesday night about Social Security. Perry declined the opportunity to back down from his book's claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme at the GOP primary debate Wednesday night, going so far as to criticize his former adviser and current agitator Karl Rove for calling his language provocative.
"Karl has been over the top for a long time in some of his remarks. So I am not responsible for Karl anymore," he said.
Earlier, Perry had re-affirmed his belief that Social Security was based on a "monstrous lie" and that absent reforms -- like giving control of the program to the states -- it would not be there for future generations.
"The fact is, we have to be focused on how we are going to change this program," the Texas governor said. "Men and women receiving those benefits today ... don't need to worry about anything. The Republican candidates are talking about ways to transition this program and it is a monstrous lie. It is a Ponzi scheme."
The debate moderators asked Mitt Romney for his response.
"You can't say that to tens of millions of Americans who have lived on Social Security," the former Massachusetts governor said. "Our nominee has to be someone who isn't committed to abolishing Social Security but is committed to saving Social Security."
"Under no circumstances will I ever say ... it is a failure," he added. "It is working for millions of Americans and I will keep it working for millions of Americans."
Perry seemed to struggle a bit with what should be a well-rehearsed topic (it has been the focal point for coverage of his campaign in its early onset). He reminded his opponents that "we are not trying to pick fights here, we are about fixing things" before falling back on his initial talking points.
"You cannot keep the status quo in place and call it anything other than a Ponzi scheme," he said, adding: "Maybe it is time to have some provocative language in this country."
Perry's response was as off politically as it was factually, said economist Dean Baker, of the liberal leaning Center for Economic Policy and Research. "With all due respect to the Governor, this is not true. The recommendations of the National Commission on Social Security Reform in 1983 led to the growth of a large surplus in Social Security. This surplus was used to buy bonds and now Social Security holds more than $2.6 trillion in government bonds," Baker e-mailed HuffPost, noting that the program's actuaries say it will pay full for the next quarter-century-plus. "Even if Congress never makes any changes to the program, Social Security will be able to pay slightly more than 80 percent of scheduled benefits from then on. This means, for example, that if your children -- both in their mid twenties -- were to retire at age 67 and do as well as you have in their working careers, they would receive $38,145 and $39,410 (in 2011 dollars) each, every year, for the rest of their lives. It is clearly inaccurate to say that this program will not exist for young people."
Roger Hickey of the progressive Campaign for America's Future previewed the Democratic strategy now available. "Gov. Perry’s remarks about Social Security show that as President, he would destroy the only retirement system that millions of Americans now depend upon -- and will in the future," he told HuffPost.

				Surely Hell is freezing over with me siding with Karl Rove.  

Perry isn't going to back down on his Ponzi scheme claims.  It would be like him saying, "don't buy my book."  His statement that Karl has been over the top for a long time falls short.  They are all over the top.  Especially Perry.  He is one of the folks who boasts about telling it like it is.  We all know that those are the folks who can't take it when they are told like it is.

				Of course Perry defends his false statements­.  He does not deal with facts; he manipulate­s emotions.

Perry told 25 year olds they will never see Social Security.  Of course this is not true, but it upsets people and many do not stop to question the facts.

So when Perry defended his false statements he just doubled-do­wn on the emotional side of the issue.  He is peddling fear.

Social Security is no more of a Ponzi scheme than depositing money into a savings account, collecting interest, and withdrawin­g it later.  And since saving is not an easy thing for most Americans to do, we need a structured program that helps us do it.  Social Security is just that.

Social Security is solvent now for the next 26 years with no changes.  In 26 years benefits need to be reduced by 25% to remain solvent; HOWEVER a much better solution is to just raise the wage ceiling from $106,800 to a higher figure, and Social Security is able to pay ALL of its obligation­s for the foreseeabl­e future.  For everyone.

But fear sells easier than facts, so don't expect Perry to back off of this position.  It works for him.

				PONZI SCHEME

	They entice new investors by offering profits other investment­s cannot guarantee in the form of short-term returns that are either abnormally high with little or no risk.

	Pays returns to investors, not from profits earned but from their own money, or from money paid by subsequent investors.

	Promises to pay out much more than alternativ­e investment­s.

	Generally will be kept secret to ensure a competitiv­e edge.

	Usually ends by the promoter vanishing with the remaining investment money.

	The investors begin demanding their money.

	Federal authoritie­s become involved.

	It become difficult to recruit new investors.

	If anything, Social Security is more like a cash-value life insurance policy.  Under certain conditions­, if you die, your family (if applicable­) will receive a monthly income and education benefits.  If you become disabled, you could be eligible for a monthly disability benefit.  And, if you live out to retirement­, you will receive a monthly benefit depending on how much you paid into Society Security.

	If you still believe Rick Perry when he calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme, then I wish you the best.

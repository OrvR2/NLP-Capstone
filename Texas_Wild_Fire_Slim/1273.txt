NEW YORK -- Winning the biggest game of college football's opening weekend boosted LSU to No. 2 in The Associated Press Top 25.

Boise State moved up a notch to No. 4 after its impressive 35-21 win against Georgia. Florida State moved up to No. 5.

				I am a Penn State fan.  BUT, in my view, their win over Scrimmage Team A this past Saturday showed nothing that merits their jumping into the top 25.  They are about as good as they were expected to be which was NOT a top 25 team.  They will be defeated, of course, by Alabama on Saturday, as expected, but, in my view, the main reason they were voted into the top 25 was so that Alabama could claim to have played a rated team and help them to make a case for moving up in the standings and qualifying for a BCS game.  Penn State is not a dog team and might be in the top 30 or 35, but top 25, based on their first scrimmage game.   Not so much.  All gamesmansh­ip by the poll voters.  I will hazard a guess that if you look at the ballots, the ones that moved Penn State into their top 25 were Big Ten voters who want the prestige of a number of ranked teams and SEC voters who want Alabama to play a "ranked" team, though this one does not qualify based on last season and anything they have shown so far this season.

				Agreed for the most part except for LSU. I was rather impressed with them. Heck, they went 11-2 last season with a terrible QB. I'm kind of hoping Jarrett Lee has a good season just to make a nice story, when you consider how awful he was in 2008.

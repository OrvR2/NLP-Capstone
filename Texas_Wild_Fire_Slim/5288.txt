NBC’s Andrea Mitchell: I have breast cancerBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – 10 hrs ago


Andrea Mitchell, NBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent and host of an eponymous MSNBC show, announced on Wednesday that she has breast cancer.
The 64-year-old Mitchell made the announcement at the end of her show, "Andrea Mitchell Reports."
"And now a personal note, or how I spent my summer vacation: I had planned to be hiking in Wyoming last week," Mitchell said, "but instead discovered that I am now among the one in eight women in this country--incredibly, one in eight--who've had breast cancer."
"Mine was discovered during my annual screening just a short time ago," she continued. "Luckily for me, I'm one of the fortunate ones. We discovered it in the earliest stage, it had not spread, and I'm already back at work with a terrific prognosis."
Mitchell urged female viewers to get screened.
"I'm looking at this as another of life's lessons," she said. "For you women out there and for the men who love you, screening matters. Do it."

Let God be the Judge of character here folks. If that was your mother, wife, or sister, you wouldn't want people saying ugly things about them. Her career has NOTHING to do with her Cancer . She has to stand before a JUST GOD. I hope she has excepted Him in her life. God Bless. Be strong til the end.

We Say a Little Prayer for You

The sympathy and prayers of all who have suffered or lost someone to cancer should go to Andrea in this her time of trial and loneliness.

Mitchell has cancer and so what? Look, the Almighty God is greater than cancer, which means He can effectively handle the cancer. I don't expect you to take me seriously, but I know what I'm saying.. I will from now on pray to that Almighty God and you, Mitchell, should expect your good health back. It even has nothing to do with whether you believe or not. I know the God that I trust.He will heal you, even without any of these man-made drugs.

Most breast cancers go away on their own, or stop growing. Screening should NOT be automatic. Bad advice.

Ladies my sister was diagnosed with "inflammatory" breast cancer. It is usually a fatal diagnosis. This type of breast cancer is not tumor driven, it is only sign is a rash on your breast. If you discover an rash on either breast, run to the doctor. After she developed the rash, her regular doctor missed its cause (OBGYN!) and sent her home with a topical cream. Then 6 weeks later she went to a dermatologist who was suspicious and sent a emergency screen to the lab. So it was 7 weeks until she was diagnosed and by then it spread to both breast and all her lymph nodes. It is invasive and fast moving cancedr.  She had a terrible extensive Chemo therapy and radation for onver 1 year. after her double masectomy. Today she is alive but the survival rate of this cancer is very low, as it spreads to the bones typically.   She has to have bone marrow extracted every few months and tested.  This is a little known and often misunderstood type of breast cancer., 
What Andrea has is typically curable. She is one of the lucky ones.,

I don't care if she's a liberal, a conservative or whatever. This is a person who has a disease. I hope it is treated successfully, and that she will be ok. End of discussion.

I do not care what she is, she has breast cancer.  Being the husband of a breast cancer survivor, I know what she and her family are going through.  I may not like what she stood for with the news, but, you people that are bashing her are pathetic.  And yes, I am a conservative republican.

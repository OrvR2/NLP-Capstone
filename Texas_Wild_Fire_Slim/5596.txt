UPDATE, 4:45pm: NBC Dallas-Fort Worth is reporting that a source at the airport told the station that a "suspicious" bag, which housed a printer, was the cause of concern. 
PREVIOUSLY: Two men were pulled from American Airlines Flight 1316 in Dallas on Wednesday morning over security concerns, the airline told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth. 
After beginning a lengthy security re-screening, the airline opted to cancel the flight, which was bound for Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. rather than dispatching it with an excessive delay.
The carrier has not yet said what raised suspicion about the men, though NBC Dallas-Fort Worth reports that a passenger observed what he or she thought was suspicious behavior and then alerted the crew of the single-aisle plane that was scheduled to depart at 10:40 a.m.
American Airlines spokesman Ed Martelle told the Huffington Post that there were "some security concerns aboard the aircraft before it left the gate" and added that "there was one individual who flagged" the suspicious activity. 
Martelle also told the Huffington Post that the plane's passengers would be re-routed to Washington on Wednesday, though he could not confirm whether the two men were part of the re-booked group.

				If the clown lady running the joint doesn’t know but can only “predict”—­ooooh, so scary—we might be able to wear our shoes—OH, GOODY—whil­e being insulted by the TSA Heffalumps at the airport, just who might we ask?  

The DHS has been begging for eradicatio­n since its launch. We’ve been prodded, poked, photograph­ed, finger-pri­nted, cowed, yelled at, our body cavities in Technicolo­r slides for the delectatio­n of Columbian rug cleaners behind TSA barriers (wanna bet?)—so General Napolitano­, Matron at Arms, thinks we might relax our guard against the Arab plague, though does anyone else find it peculiar that Leon Panetta at DOD recently said that 9/11 could happen all over again on any given day? (No surprise that we have done nothing in a decade to seriously deter such an Arab cockpit jihad—well­, except for constant DHS warnings not to Arabs but to other Americans. Not convinced? What one population has been most subjected to uninvited and intrusive inspection­s, altercatio­ns and insults since 9/11?)

We Americans.

We’ve been attacked twice, once by filthy, addle-brai­ned middle-Eas­terners, on the second occasion by hostile American boobs who should be staked into the Mojave scrabble until they wither. The DHS is the single most hapless collection of fu**ups in American government­.

It’s all so pitiful, isn’t it? 

Ten years, thousands upon thousands of people dead. And nothing done. And Allah, the creep, hasn’t helped even the slightest bit.

				If all the people who were on the 4 planes used for the 9/11 attacks were alive today, I'll bet that not one single one of them NOR their family members would complain about airport security. You don't get a "do over" if you if you make the mistake of not screening the passengers­.

				Some of my favorites. Skill like this takes life long dedication to the art.

"I think they bring in the Arabs to keep secruity alerts high in America? Without them how could this very well educated fools at the air port stop flights?? Bring more Arabs here we don't have enough to support?? "

"Sure is strange that the nationalit­­y of neither man is mentioned. The Huff Post is really not "up front" with their stories. After all, Ariana is a Super Lib with a foreign accent to boot. "

"Wow, do you sound stupid. If the plane blew up you would be saying something different right? "

"Exactly why I never fly unless I have to. Terrorists will never quit trying ."

"I don't buy there gas, liquor, motel, if they'll leave this hunkey as_ alone, I never be guilty of profiling. "  

"We must never feel upset or nervous when we see two Arab men boarding a plane with us. It might hurt their feelings. It's better to die in a blaze of glory than to hurt an Arab's feelings."

"Thats a stupid assumption­­, terrorists "test" all the time to see what they can get through for the real thing to come later. If they broke rules then they should be arrested. "

"Well done in this darn complicate­­d dangerous times.God bless America,th­­e country I love so much.My kids are half Americans and half Europeans with their Dad. "

				A printer? I don't understand this.  Why wasn't it caught by scanner?   When I travel, I carry my nebulizer for asthma onboard because it would be scary if the airline misplaced it.  It may come as a shock but airlines do lose luggage.   After it passes through x-ray, I am  required to unzip the case and it is wiped with some sort of testing solution but relax, folks, you are safe from one wimpy little 70 year old grandmothe­r.  I know that you iwll sleep better knowing that.

				Security personnel need to use common sense. I was once accosted by an airport officer because someone overheard me say the word "gun" on the phone. I was discussing a recent news story with my mother. I was chided to be "very careful" what I say. If I had it to do over, I would refuse to say anything without a lawyer present and demand to know who this person was, as is my Constituti­onal right. I wish I had gotten this officer's name and badge number so that I could have filed a formal complaint.

				we pay for their "denied boarding coupon", the free tickets received in exchange for their inconvenie­nce, because the airline will use it as a tax write off.....a promotion and service in the cost of doing business. The amount that will be written off will be for the cost of a full coach fare even if they paid $89 for their original ticket. Call an airline and ask them what the cost of a ticket is for travel tomorrow from Dallas to Washington National..­..oh gag....I'm sorry, I meant Reagan National airport. The handed out compensati­on is written off with air fares that do not require advance purchase, minimum or maximum stay, etc.  They pay no taxes either. Forget oil companies. Look at the airlines!!­!!!!!!!

Austin Museum of Art “Good Design” Art Exhibit

Posted on September 8, 2011 by Furnish123ATX


Attention interior design lovers and Herman Miller fans! This week is the last week to check out the Austin Museum of Art’s design-friendly exhibit, Good Design: Stories by Herman Miller. The exhibit “explores the collaborative problem-solving design process employed at the world-renowned and West Michigan-based furniture company, Herman Miller, Inc,” according to the AMOA website.

Herman Miller designers are best-known for their beautiful, practical furniture and for giving the world some of the most iconic pieces of the century.
On Thursday, September 1, in conjunction with the exhibit, local interior designers and architects were invited to the Austin Museum of Art-Downtown for the Herman Miller and Workplace Resources’ Good Design Challenge. In celebration of the exhibit, Herman Milller challenged local designers and artists to use the classic white Eames molded plastic chair as a canvas to their self-expression. AMOA will display the chairs in the Community Room and daily visitors will be asked to ‘vote’ on their favorites by making a donation in support of their most loved chair.

The display donations and live auction proceeds will benefit The Art School at Laguna Gloria Scholarship Program and Community in Schools-Central Texas. You can also see the chairs in this AMOA video posted to the museum’s Facebook page.
Have you been to the Good Design exhibit yet? Do you have a favorite chair?

Where else?

(Newser) -
                                    Insert appropriate Journey lyric here: Tareq Salahi  was convinced his wife had been kidnapped  today, but it turns out that Michaele is safe and sound ... in the arms of Journey guitarist Neal Schon, reports  TMZ .

Michaele Salahi Abducted, Says Tareq
And police aren't taking him seriously, he tells TMZ

(Newser) -
                                    Now this is bizarre: Tareq Salahi has reached out to  TMZ  because he thinks wife Michaele has been the victim of a publicity stunt, er, kidnapping. Salahi, who is of course famous for  crashing a White House dinner with his wife  and then moving on to a stint on Real ...

Guess Who's Allegedly Stripping for Playgirl? 
The wrong Salahi, one might argue

(Newser) -
                                    For those yearning from the depths of their aching souls to see Tareq Salahi naked—and we're quite sure there are none of you—brace yourselves.

Meet Michaele Salahi, Gatecrashing Action Figure
She goes all plastic

(Newser) -
                                    In her never-ending quest to promote herself, Michaele Salahi has arranged to recreate herself as a gatecrashing action figure. Her plastic mini-me, dudded out in her red ninja White House State Dinner sari and shawl, has been fashioned by  HeroBuilders,  which has also made Sarah Palin, Jersey Shore and Jon...

Tim Gunn Calls Bluff on Michaele Salahi's MS
Salahis are 'sociopaths who believe own lies,' says fashion wonk

(Newser) -
                                    Poor White House gatecrasher Michaele Salahi recently revealed she has multiple sclerosis, which is why she had to duck out of the state dinner so quickly. One problem, though: The newly snarky Tim Gunn doesn't believe it. “I find it curious that the story is coming out now,"...

Salahis: We're Tired of Being the 'It' Couple
Life is so, so hard for Michaele and Tareq

(Newser) -
                                    You wouldn't know it from the way they  crashed a White House dinner  and  got themselves on a reality show , but apparently Michaele and Tareq Salahi really, really hate being so famous. They want to "return to who we were," Michaele tells HBO in a profile of their...

Albeit not the sanctioned-by-Bravo party

(Newser) -
                                    Talk about a buzzkill: Michaele and Tareq Salahi were served with papers at their own party Thursday night. A PR firm claims the Salahis owe it more than $15,000 for its promotion of the couple's  sketchy 2008 “charity” polo event , and an employee says the process server handed...

'Housewives' premiere sure to be embarrassing

(Newser) -
                                    If the first episode of Real Housewives of DC is any indication, the series probably won’t be on the White House DVR queue. Embarrassments abound, starting with the connection shown between Michele Jones—who works for the secretary of defense and supposedly told the gatecrashing Salahis  she couldn’t...

But it looked like they had their own dining plans

(Newser) -
                                    It only sounds like deja vu all over again: Party crashers Michaele and Tareq Salahi were stopped in a limo near the White House last night, but it doesn't look like they were trying to bust their way into their second state dinner.

(Newser) -
                                    Alleged White House gate-crashers Tareq and Michaele Salahi said little to a House panel today, repeatedly invoking their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.

(Newser) -
                                    What lapse allowed Carlos Allen, the third party crasher, to sneak into the Obamas' first state dinner remains a mystery. What is known is that Allen—who has done everything from designing clothes to selling mortgages to running a questionable charity that existed mainly to throw parties—dressed even more...

                                    A House committee followed up on its threat to force the couple who crashed President Obama's State Dinner last month to testify.

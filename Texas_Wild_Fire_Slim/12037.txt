The driver of the vehicle, Patricia Dolton, was backing out of her driveway when she said her accelerator got stuck. The car drove backward, struck a pole and went into the home on the 400 block of Connor Street of the far southwest suburb, said Will County Sheriff Department Dep. Chief Ken Kaupas. 
A 28-year-old man, identified as Zachary Isenberg, was in the home and was killed when the car came crashing through. 
First-responders arrived on the scene and looked for more victims. They didn't find any, but came upon a locked door. Inside, authorities said they found 13 marijuana plants. 
Dolton, 63, was taken to Silver Cross Hospital with minor injuries. Her passenger, who was not identified, was not injured. 
Alcohol was not involved, Kaupas said. 
No charges had been filed by 4 p.m. Saturday, as the incident was still under investigation. 
The vehicle remained in the home because officials said the home may collapse when the car is removed.

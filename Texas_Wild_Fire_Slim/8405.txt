Philippines catches 'largest crocodile on record'By Cecil Morella | AFP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

Click to see more photos of the monster croc caught in the Philippines.A monster 21-foot (6.4-meter) saltwater crocodile, believed to be the biggest ever captured, has been trapped in the southern Philippines after a spate of fatal attacks, officials said Tuesday.
The 1,075-kg (2,370-pound) male is suspected of eating a farmer who went missing in July in the town of Bunawan, and of killing a 12-year-old girl whose head was bitten off two years ago, crocodile hunter Rollie Sumiller said.
The hunter examined the crocodile's stomach contents by forcing it to vomit after it was captured Saturday, but there was no trace of human remains or of several water buffaloes also reported missing by locals.
"The community was relieved," Sumiller said of the capture, but added: "We're not really sure if this is the man-eater, because there have been other sightings of other crocodiles in the area."
The local government of the impoverished town of 30,000 people has decided against putting down the reptile, and will instead build a nature park where it will go on display.
Josefina de Leon, wildlife division chief at the Philippines environment ministry, said the beast was likely the biggest crocodile ever captured anywhere in the world.
"Based on existing records the largest that had been captured previously was 5.48 meters long," she told AFP.
The Philippine specimen would easily dwarf the largest captive saltwater crocodile, which the Guinness World Records website lists as Cassius, a 5.48-meter (18-foot) male which lives at an Australian nature park.
Press reports also describe other huge crocs including a 6.2-meter (20.3-foot) adult male killed in Papua New Guinea in 1982 that was measured after it was skinned.
The Bunawan hunting team, employed by a government-run crocodile breeding farm, began laying bait using chicken, pork and dog meat on August 15 in an attempt to snare the beast.
But the reptile, which measured three feet (0.91 meters) across its back, simply bit off both the meat and the line it was skewered on.
A heavy metal cable finally proved beyond the power of its jaws, and the beast was subdued in a creek late Saturday with the help of about 30 local men.
It was the team's second attempt after a failed expedition launched in response to the fatal 2009 attack.
Beyond the mark of the hook inside its upper jaw, the crocodile did not appear to have sustained any serious injuries, Sumiller said.
Bunawan Mayor Edwin Cox Elorde said the government would build a nature park showcasing the giant crocodile and other species found in the vast marshland on the upper reaches of the massive Agusan river basin on Mindanao island.
"It will be the biggest star of the park," Elorde told reporters.
Sumiller said the plan was the best option available for the creature.
"He's a problem crocodile that needs to be taken from the wild... and used for eco-tourism," he said.
Crocodylus porosus, or the estuarine crocodile, is the world's largest reptile. It grows to five or six metres in length and can live up to 100 years.
While not considered an endangered species globally, it is "critically endangered" in the Philippines, where it is hunted for its hide which is used in the fashion industry, de Leon said.
"There have been very few sightings of porosus in the wild in the Philippines in recent years," she added.
In July, a saltwater crocodile measuring almost 14 feet (4.2 meters) was caught on the western Philippine island of Palawan after it killed a man.

The crocodile's stomach contents were examined, but there was no trace of human remains or of several water buffaloes also reported missing by locals. So, it was just another excuse to kill an innocent creature. Oh well, what do you expect from an ignorant backward race that eat dogs and cats?

They used dog meat as bait?  What kind of warped archaic country baits a crocodile with dog meat?  Pathetic scum.

Not every Filipinos eat dog meat! Morons! Its a case to case bases. We love animals  and have dog pets too. But we value people/relatives more than any animals. Unlike to some cultures, they prefer dogs and cats rather than having children of their own. Some give their fortunes when they pass away to some animals charity... so? who's more HUMAN???

Those of you questioning the use of dog meat- meat is meat! Did you read the part about the people are impoverished or that people are dead because of crocs in the area. It amazes me that you worry about a freaken dog. Up until recently dog meat was eaten around the world and still is in some places. If there were another world war- most of you would die of hunger. This has nothing to do with morals- it's stupidity. If need be- dogs are food.

Si le crocodile n'est pas pas une espèce en voie de disparition,autant profiter de sa capture pour confectionner avec sa peau des chaussures ou  un costume....Ceci en mémoire des humains dévorés...

Forget the crocodile!!!!

It is awful to read following excerpt from the article where it states "dog meat" is used as crocodile bait.:

"The Bunawan hunting team, employed by a government-run crocodile breeding farm, began laying bait using chicken, pork and dog meat on August 15 in an attempt to snare the beast."

Dogs are highly intelligent and very loving creatures. It is a sad shame to hear of harm done on them in this way......

This story is screwed up. This slimy monster bites the head off some little girl, they use mans best friend as bait to catch the thing and people are saying "oh i'm glad they did'nt hurt the poor crocodile. Kill the f@#$ing thing and get it over with.

"forcing vomit"? It sickens me what humans do. Leave nature be and i sure hope they put this poor animal back to its home. I could care less about "food chain". If these people think they are in danger, then build up fences or move, don't capture something that could go instinct.

PLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEAAAASSSSSEEEE DO NOT BUG ME WITH THE ECO SYSTEM OUT OF BALANCE, MILLIONS HAVE TOTALLY DISSAPEARED AND WE PROTECT THIS USELESS UGLY SHITS FOR NOTHING. THEY EAT ANYTHING NOT JUST IN THE PHULIPPINES BUT IN FLORIDA, ALLIGATOR, CROCODILE ALL THE SAME TO ME, KILL THEM ALL AND START CLEARING THE SNAKES TOO. USELESS UGLY THINGS THAT A DANGER TO HUMANS AND ANIMALS. SHOES, WALLETS AND PURSES FOR THE LADIES WOULD BE VERY APPRECIATED.

HOLY CRAP!!!   that thing is a beast a monster...kill it, kill it, kill it!!!   make some hand bags and boots from it and don't forget belts too.on the other hand, a taxidermist could stuff it.
I heard the meat is pretty tasty, but if it is that big, it is probably old too. so maybe it is tougher then leather.

Dear Crocodile:  I'm really sorry about the humans.  It's the humans who should be bound and gagged.

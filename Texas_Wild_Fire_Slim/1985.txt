Now this is one way to teach sex ed.
Last week, Shanghaiist posted pictures of young children learning about the human body by playing with dolls that feature very lifelike parts, including genitalia with pubic hair.
According to ImagineChina, the agency that provided the images to HuffPost, the photos are from Yaolan Kindergarten, a school in Zhengzhou, the capital city of Henan province in central China. The pictures were taken in April.
POTENTIALLY UNSETTLING PHOTOS BELOW
The dolls have, naturally, drawn criticism from some parents. "I am worried that it's not good for the kids to know sexual knowledge so early," one parent said, according to Shanghai Daily. 
But China, which has one of the highest abortion rates in the world, is, like many countries, grappling with how to effectively teach sex education in schools. 
The Associated Press reports that a 2009 study found that while two-thirds of adolescents and young adults in China "had very limited levels of sexual reproductive health knowledge," they were also open to premarital sex. 
From the Associated Press:
The survey found 22 percent had had sex before; of those, more than 50 percent used no contraception during their first sexual encounter. A 2009 survey of American high schoolers by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control found 46 percent of students had had sex and 85 percent used contraceptives during their most recent sexual activity.
According to China Daily, a state-run newspaper, almost two-thirds of abortions performed annually are on women between the ages of 20 and 29, most of whom are unmarried.
In August, the country announced an experimental -- and controversial -- sexual education program in 18 primary schools in Beijing, China Daily reports. Beginning this term, students as young as six years old will be taught about sexuality from "Growing Steps," a textbook that features graphical depictions and descriptions of sex.
China isn't the only country being criticized for how it's teaching sexual education. Last week, the Vatican blasted New York City public schools for teaching condom usage to middle school students, calling it "useless, and even harmful."
Do you think these dolls are effective for teaching sexual education to children? Are the children too young? Take a look at the slideshow below and let us know in the comments. You can also vote in the poll following the images.

				I think those dolls are hilarious, but maybe useful.  I don't imagine the kids will be damaged in any way by this attempt to give them informatio­n.   

Heaven knows, this country is not getting it right with its ridiculous ''abstinen­ce only'' approach.  Stats on teen pregnancy and STD incidence from other developed countries prove that education and condoms beat ignorance and religion every time.

				The older I get, the more convinced I become that growing up sheltered and uneducated or under educated about natures physiologi­cal mechanisms does a disservice to our youth.

Children, when taught young, don't naturally put the "nasty" spin on the informatio­n. 
A few giggles for sure, that's immaturity­, but when the giggling stops and the learning begins, it's accepted informatio­n that we as parents want the children to know, taught in a healthy, nurturing environmen­t.

They soak in the physical informatio­n and begin a dialogue with the people they trust for accurate updates to their curiosity. 
They may even share with others and come to a more knowledgea­ble consensus about peer pressure and such.

Open dialogue is a major factor when it comes to getting informatio­n from the streets or the classrooms­.

If parents want their children to become knowledgea­ble about their bodies and the bodies functional­ity, where better to learn about the physiologi­cal mechanisms­, taking the "sexy" aspect out of sexuality.
They have enough garbage to deal with in the battles on the streets.

I honestly think that the concerned objections some parents may have, will be found in the fear that they themselves lack the "sexual education" to enhance in terms of asked questions, the teachings found in the classroom, having gotten their personal sexual education on the streets.

				It's a good idea. The whole Church nonsense with keeping children "in the dark" and then trying to impose chastity is just making kids have meaningles­s unprotecte­d sex, out of curiosity and lack of knowledge. 
There's nothing shameful or unnatural about this kind of education.

				I don't know where you get your ignorant knowledge. But I grew up in a Christian home, and my mother was very progressiv­e in educating me, using appropriat­e age-approp­riate materials to teach sex education. Many people, Christian or not, are too afraid to talk to their child about sex and usually begin when it's too late. I was never in the dark, and I grew up in a Conservati­ve home and was home schooled for about 8yrs. I knew kids who went to public school that knew less then I did. I graduated from a public high school and never felt the need or pressure of having sex and only lost my virginity at 23 to the man I'm going to spend the rest of life with (and in no means was he the only man I'd dated).

				The new life, or the life of sexual taboos is solidly rooted in most society,  all specially in those that are  Very religious. All share the same concern, Woman and her sexual power.  As you can never desire God as much as you would desire a woman, one single group of men of faith, wrote the manifesto that allowed the church, of back then, more powerful than the president of today, to seek out brutally, the impure, all specially the women and the Jews. 
The centuries of the most brutal inquisitiv­e campaigns unleashed by the church against its enemies, lasted almost a thousand years, and  women, so embedded with their potent sexual image, were heavily abused for it. It went as far as depicting women as sinners, impure  tools of the devil, or gangbang worshipers­.  
Many, like Jane of Arc, have perished in the flames of an  injustice that served convenient­ly all kind of purposes, one was to keep the church's influences intact and global.   They lost. 
Today, two thousands years later, woman is still  a threat to the church's influences­. All they have succeed to do and maintain are rules and laws that  control her freedom. 
Yeah, sex is a taboo alive and kicking.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The families of two UC Berkeley graduates who have been locked up for more than two years in Iran as accused spies rejoiced Tuesday after that country's president promised to let the men go as a "humanitarian gesture" and a court set a $500,000 price tag for their freedom.
The release of Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal - who may be home by the end of the week - would end an ordeal that began with what the men, who are both 29, have described as an innocent hike in Iraq's Kurdish region on July 31, 2009.
Their imprisonment became another standoff between the United States and Iran, with an ironic twist: The men Tehran dubbed U.S. secret agents were Berkeley-bred idealists who once taught a student-led class envisioning a harmonious, post-capitalist society.
The men's plight changed rapidly early Tuesday. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told NBC's "Today" show that Bauer and Fattal, who were each sentenced to eight years in prison last month, would be released "in a couple of days." 
$500,000 bail
Later, the men's defense attorney in Iran, Masoud Shafii, told the Associated Press that they would be released from Evin Prison in Tehran upon paying bail of $500,000 apiece.
A similar arrangement led to the release last September of a third hiker, 33-year-old Sarah Shourd, another UC Berkeley graduate who had spent 410 days in solitary confinement. She and Bauer became engaged while in prison in Iran.
"While we do not have further details at this time, we are overjoyed by the positive news reports from Iran," the families of the imprisoned men said in a statement. "Shane and Josh's freedom means more to us than anything, and it's a huge relief to read that they are going to be released.
"We're grateful to everyone who has supported us and looking forward to our reunion with Shane and Josh. We hope to say more when they are finally back in our arms."
Had worked in Syria
Before their capture, Bauer and Shourd were living and working in Damascus, Syria - he as a freelance journalist and she teaching English to Iraqi refugees. Fattal, a native of Pennsylvania, was visiting the couple after working as a teaching fellow in Asia and Africa.
Bauer, a Minnesota native whose writing and photography have appeared in The Chronicle, e-mailed a friend four days before his arrest. He said he was going to Iraq's Kurdish region, where elections were being held, to "feel out the situation there and get some ideas for deeper stories."
After her release, Shourd, a Los Angeles native, said she and her companions had been arrested while hiking near a waterfall that is popular with tourists and locals. She said they had accidentally crossed into Iran after an armed guard beckoned them off a path and then refused to allow them to return.
If her group was across the border, Shourd said, "that border was entirely unmarked and indistinguishable."
No diplomatic ties
The Swiss government has negotiated with Iran on behalf of the United States, which has not had diplomatic ties with Iran since the hostage crisis of 1979. The two countries' main feud involves Iran's nuclear program.
In his television interview, which NBC translated, Ahmadinejad complained that there are Iranians who are unfairly imprisoned in the United States. He said he hoped the release of Bauer and Fattal would soothe relations between the two countries.
He defended the arrests, saying the men "illegally crossed our borders." He also said Bauer and Fattal enjoyed "very good conditions here in prison. It's like staying in a hotel.
"I think the problem is in the approach of the American politicians and leaders. Why are the American leaders so hostile to us?" Ahmadinejad said. "These two persons will be released. It is going to be over. We do it, for example, in a humanitarian gesture. Is it going to solve the problems? I hope so."
Among those who have called for the release of the UC Berkeley graduates are President Obama and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Experts on Iran, meanwhile, have noted that its leaders seemed to be looking for a way to end the long ordeal.
U.N. visit coming up
It is no coincidence that Ahmadinejad announced the possible release a week before he is scheduled to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York, the "media mecca of the world," said Abbas Milani, who directs Iranian studies at Stanford University.
"Usually in anticipation of this trip, the regime makes some gesture to show it is a law-abiding member of the international community," Milani said.
Another factor, Milani said, could be the explosive uprising in Syria. Last week, Ahmadinejad urged Syrian President Bashar Assad to stop the violent crackdown on those who challenge his rule.
The uprising "has made the clerical regime in Iran deeply worried," Milani said. "Releasing the two American hostages is part of the regime's elaborate and carefully choreographed, but ultimately unbelievable, 'dance of democracy.' "
Mark Juergensmeyer, director of the Global and International Studies Department at UC Santa Barbara, said, "It appears as if the Ahmadinejad government gave up on trying to get political or policy benefits out of what was clearly a hostage taking and has settled on getting money instead. Now we know what the going price of a U.S. life is in Iran."

The Dagger 
Fri Sep 09 04:59pm EDT
Elite recruit eliminates Baylor because he doesn’t like its colors By      Jeff Eisenberg



The strong relationship Archie Goodwin forged with Baylor coach Scott Drew apparently wasn't enough to overcome what the highly touted class of 2012 shooting guard didn't like about the program.
Goodwin's really not fond of Baylor's colors or its Adidas affiliation.
In an interview with Sync Magazine's Evin Demirel earlier this week, Goodwin explained why he recently narrowed his list to Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Memphis and UConn. The Arkansas native eliminated Missouri and Texas because his relationship with their head coaches wasn't satisfactory, but his rationale for trimming Baylor was a bit more unconventional.
"Coach Scott Drew is a great guy. I love Coach Drew. They were one of  the first schools that were recruiting me. But I didn't  like that they  were an adidas team, but that's not to say I wouldn't go to Kansas  because Kansas is a great team.  I can look over the adidas thing — I  own some adidas stuff. [Goodwin played recent summers with the Arkansas Wings Elite team, which is sponsored by Nike] I didn't like their colors, either. I  don't like green and gold. That's ugly …. When you got ugly colors like  that, you gotta be Nike. …. Baylor has some ugly shoes, too."
Granted that's an awfully superficial reason for Goodwin to eliminate a program that was among the first to show interest, but his candor is refreshing in an age of canned quotes and politically correct opinions. And the No. 12 recruit in Rivals.com's 2012 rankings probably is not alone in thinking that Baylor's green and gold road uniforms and matching high tops aren't very flattering.
At least Baylor can take solace that its clashing color scheme hasn't prevented Drew from assembling some of the nation's best recruiting classes the past two seasons.
In 2010, the Bears signed 6-foot-11 forward Perry Jones, a consensus top 10 prospect in his class who averaged 13.9 points and 7.1 rebounds as a freshman last season. And this year's Baylor class includes five-star recruits Quincy Miller and Deuce Bello and top junior college point guard Pierre Jackson.

1 users disliked this comment aubie 10 minutes ago Report Abuse Sad state of college sports and the future of young people in America. I would bet the kid scores a 600 on his SAT and already has on child and another on the way from a different well educated person. I feel sorry for the coaches who have to deal with these brats and than when society has to take care of them when their dream fails and no way to support themselves and their 5 kids. I am sure George Bush caused this problem!

0 users disliked this comment Kiss_My_Converse 16 minutes ago Report Abuse The school is going to make money off this kid regardless of where he plays and will cut him loose the first time he can't put money back in their pockets,so hell might as well like the colors they put on your back. The dude has multiple offers from different schools so I believe he has earned the right to be choosey. But on the other hand, not choosing a school based off   a huge sponsor is good way to kill any future endorsement (if he is lucky to make it that far)

Whats really funny is most of the people hating on the kid (like he is the 1st kid to pick something because of it color) are grown women & men   who are still picking things or on people because of colors.

0 users disliked this comment kevin 42 minutes ago Report Abuse It is not racist to think he is not interested in a fine university because he does not like the colors, his priorities are not in order. Anyone who would turn down the chance for an education has only one thing on their mind.. 'Money' so I have some questions.. 1. What will you do if you ARE fortunate enough to get an NBA contract one day and you get hurt and cannot play anymore? 2. Will you rely on your friends or just hope that some TV sports anchor job opens up like so many others have? 3. Will you rely on your brains and other abilities to get you somewhere? Apparently not because turning down a school and the chance for an education is dumb! So many out there wish they had your chance and will never get it because they cannot play basketball! In my opinion, sports should never be part of higher education admission, if you have the grades and the aptitude and paid your dues to warrant an admission then great, playing a sport does not mean you are qualified for an admission but if you can then that should be a 'secondary' thought but NEVER a key   point for an admission to a school.   It's all about money to the school and to the player... I am an athlete , I wrestled college and played college football and have several college degrees so I can talk! You turned down a chance because of the school team colors??? I remember when schools turned people of color away.!   Good luck to you, I hope you find what you want.

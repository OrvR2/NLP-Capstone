he said that this is actually an event that occurred 20Mil years ago. that cant be true. i consulted the Tea Party manual and god only created the universe 6,000 years ago. this is another satanic plot like the evolution, dinosaurs, neanderthal man, and global warming hoaxes. all the science u need is right there in the bible. vote perry or bachmann if you believe in god and want to be saved.

All celestial bodies are so far away, and it takes their light so long to reach us, that all we see are their old pictures! That supernova could already be gone, and we are still watching it's demise.

you can tell how old it is by examining where it originates and comparing that data to how bright or close it is. Light travels. fast, but it still travels. that is how measure the distance of EACH star. your seein lights that could actually be out by now but the light hasnt reached earth yet. Technically half the universe could be a bunch of exploded supernova stars and we wont know untill we can actuallt begin to see them. by which time it shall be too late unfortunatley.

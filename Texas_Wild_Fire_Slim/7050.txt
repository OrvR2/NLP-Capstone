September 5-11: Tony Bennett Reveals What He Wanted To Tell Amy Winehouse

Posted Sat Sep 10, 2011 11:55am PDT by Billy Johnson, Jr. in That's Really Week




Entertainment legend Tony Bennett has spoken a lot about
working with the late Amy Winehouse during the promotion of his forthcoming
jazz album, "Duets II," which includes collaborations with contemporary artists
Lady Gaga, Sheryl Crow, Queen Latifah, and Winehouse, among others.
But the interviews have mainly focused on Winehouse's talent
and how she impressed Bennett with her knowledge of music. In an interview with
ABC's "20/20" that aired Friday, Bennett discussed his concerns for the singer, 
who appears with him on the "Duets II" song "Body And Soul."
"She sang beautifully and then I just regretted that I
wasn't able to tell her to slow down," Bennett told "20/20." 
Bennett said he could relate to Winehouse's bout with
drugs.  "Many years ago, I had a touch of
the drugs and was playing to full houses, and people were kinda putting up with
me," Bennett revealed.
Bennett said learning about another artist's challenges with
drugs helped him change his own self-destructive behavior. The other troubled artist
was said to have "sinned against his talent." That description put things into
perspective for Bennett. "Boy, that one sentence changed my life. It meant I
stopped all drugs completely," Bennett said.
"I said, 'I don't want to die. I love life.' Life is a
gift," Bennett continued. "I wanted to tell her, 'You gotta stop, 'cause if you
don't, you're going to die.' And then she died. Twenty-seven-years-old. She died. So the
whole secret is to live long and enjoy life."
Winehouse was ecstatic to work with Bennett. In behind-the-scenes
footage from the making of "Duets II," Winehouse recalled meeting Bennett at
the 2008 Grammys, when Bennett presented her with the Record Of The Year award.
"I was in shock, not because I won the Grammy, but because
Tony Bennett said my name," Winehouse said. "Standing shoulder to shoulder was
amazing. It was a dream come true for me."
Bennett said he and Winehouse bonded when he told her that
she reminded him of an celebrated jazz singer. "I said to her, 'I may be
wrong, but I think you were influenced by Dinah Washington.' That did it. She
said, 'How did you know that? That's my goddess. I love her more than anybody.'
That changed the whole record date."
Bennett's Winehouse stories aren't the only artist's
reflections that made news this week. Country icon Alan Jackson is also in the
press for revisiting his song "Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning)"
released 10 years ago as a tribute to September 11. Soulja Boy was forced to
reflect on his choice of lyrics after experiencing backlash for his
anti-U.S. Army reference in his song "Let's Be Real." He has since apologized.
Nick Jonas will revive his days of starring in stage
productions. He announced this week that he would be taking on Daniel
Radcliffe's role in the Broadway run of "How To Succeed In Business
Without Really Trying." And lastly, Lil Wayne continues to dominate hip-hop
with the release of his latest album, "Tha Carter IV," which debuted at No. 1
Wednesday with sales of nearly 1 million.

This will be an enjoyable video for sure.

18 users disliked this commentA Yahoo! User 14 hours ago Report Abuse She didn't die of a drug overdoes: She took too many drugs PREVIOUSLY and even though she was clean and finished rehab, the drugs built up and killed her. That happened with George Carlin, except at an older age. She was an amazing singer and musician, and it's a shame that she wasn't able to live long enough to live up to her potential. When she walks away, the sun goes down <3 We love you, Amy! You are no longer hurting <3

It really was a terrible thing to happen. Especially when she tried in vain to sta y   sober.   I guess her heart just gave out from past indulges into the drug world.   A talent is wasted.

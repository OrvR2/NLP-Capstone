Authorities in Ohio have arrested a junkyard security guard on charges of blackmailing a teenage girl into having sex after she allegedly broke into the junkyard.
According to court documents, Marshall Sheldon, 59, was working at a junkyard in North Bend, a small town about 25 miles west of Cincinnati, on Wednesday afternoon, when he caught a 17-year-old girl stealing scrap metal.
Sheldon allegedly grabbed the victim and told her "unless she did something for him, he was going to call the police and have her arrested," the arrest affidavit states. Sheldon allegedly attempted to unbutton the girl’s pants but gave up when she struggled. He then asked her to perform oral sex on him, which she did, according to court documents.
Following the alleged sex act, the girl went home and told her mother what happened. The two then returned to the junkyard to confront Sheldon, who was staying inside a bus on the property. When the girl and her mother -- both of whom were allegedly armed with tools -- approached him, Sheldon locked himself inside the bus and called police.
"They're busting the windows out of the side of the bus. ... I'm cut [and] bleeding from the glass flying out of the window," Sheldon told the 911 dispatcher. 
When questioned by police, Sheldon admitted to the allegations and was charged with rape, according to the documents.
On Thursday, Sheldon made his first court appearance on a felony rape charge in Hamilton County Municipal Court before Judge Matthew W. Fellerhoff.
"The court takes these allegations very seriously," Fellerhoff told Sheldon, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. "Nobody deserves that sort of treatment, based on the allegations."
Following the brief proceeding, Sheldon was ordered held on $10,000 bond.
Sheldon did not return calls from The Huffington Post today.

				This entire story sounds very strage... It sounds like a story invented by the girl and her mother so that the girl ends up as a victim instead of a criminal..­.

Girls do this all the time.

While Men work, build, invent, discover, fix, improve, and ... compete... Women Lie !

Women Lie about being Raped !

Women Lie about being Abused !

Women Lie to the Police !

Women Lie to their Partner !

Women Lie to their Employer !

Women Lie in Court !

Women Lie whenever they think they can gain from it... or simply be relieved from a responsibi­lity !

I see it every day !

What ladies? ... In the 16 years I have live in this country I have seen nothing but BPD/NPD women with overly inflated Sense of Entitlemen­t.

Where are the Ladies? Can you help me find them?

1. Give Women Voting Rights

2. Give Women Equal Rights

3. Give Women Extra Rights

4. Give Women Extra Protection­... from Men

5. Hear only Women and Ignore Men

6. Believe Women only and Treat men as Perpetrato­rs

7. Let Women Falsely Accuse Men without Consequenc­es

8. Encourage Women to be Helpless Victims and to think of All Men as Rapists

9. Encourage False Accusation­s by Women (VAWA) and Punish Innocent Men

10. ...Watch Women Destroy Men, the Family and Society !!!

				Something about this just doesn't sit right. The girl was in the junkyard, attempting to steal scrap metal. She's caught and ends up having to perform oral sex in order to leave. She goes home, tells her mother, and instead of her mother taking her to the ER to be checked and call the cops, they go back to the junkyard. This is definitely speculatio­n, but it occurs to me that this was a regular occurrence for this girl and her mother was probably behind her doing it. Maybe they had a "situation­" worked out, and the security guard didn't stick to his end of the bargain, figuring that he had the upper hand. Let's be real, this is petty theft (well, depending on the value of the scrap metal); if she's a first time offender, she's most likely going to get probation. Him going to the police over a first time offense is not cause for concern...­.but his threat would have weight if this wasn't a first time offense, if she was already on probation, or if he had proof that she had been stealing for a while. 

I really need to stop watching Law & Order.

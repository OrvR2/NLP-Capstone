How a 14-year-old girl made NHL video game history By      Greg Wyshynski




Thanks to the outrage and persistence of a 14-year-old girl from Buffalo, N.Y., female hockey players will appear for the first time in EA Sports' NHL video game series.
Lexi Peters, 14, would often challenge her brother in EA Sports' NHL video games, but started to feel her enjoyment turning into frustration. He could create a character with his name and with his likeness; she could create a character with her name but that would appear on the ice as a man, as there was no option to create female hockey players.
On the advice of her father, Peters took action: Writing letters of frustration to EA Sports COO Peter Moore, calling the exclusion of female players "unfair to women and girl hockey players around the world" and saying that it's "not fun" to play as a male character in the game, according to the Globe & Mail.
Moore passed her protests to David Littman, executive producer of the hockey game series. "My first thought was that we want to make people happy with our game. And here's one girl who wasn't happy playing our game," he said.
Littman took her letters to the production team and declared, "We gotta get this girl in the game, and there are probably other girls like her that want to create their own female players."
Female players can be created and used for the first time in "NHL 12," scheduled for release on Tuesday.
"Lexi may or may not ever play in the NHL. But here she gets to play in the NHL, in the virtual world. And that's really important to us," said Littman.

Peters had created players in previous incarnations of the game, but always had to settle for playing as a man on the ice.
From the Globe & Mail:
The 4 foot 11 teen has played hockey for four years. She and a teammate spent hours creating a whole custom hockey team, modeling the players after their own all-girls team, the Purple Eagles.
The best they could do was give the characters long "hockey" hair. "We looked like men," she says.
Littman said her letters brought the issue home. "Here's a girl who's playing with her brother and she's not happy. She can't create herself," he said.
The issue came to his attention during the production process, and it was immediately prioritized for "NHL 12." It didn't replace any features slated for the game, but the designers knew there had to be extra work done to incorporate female players in the create-a-player mode.
As a tribute to the girl who inspired the change, the game's designers asked Lexi to send photos of herself in to EA Sports. Using those images, she became the default female character for the game — the model whose hair and eye color, uniform and name can be changed to suit the user.
"Now she has an advantage over her brother," said Littman.
"Her face is in the game — his isn't."
So if a player can use a female character to make passes, score goals and block shots … can they fight, too?
"Let's just say that when you create a female character, it's no different than creating a male character," teased Littman.
While this is the first time EA Sports has allowed for female players in its hockey games, it isn't the first time a female character has appeared. In "NHL 09," a female goalie named Sabrina Ladha is listed as a free agent with stellar player ratings. She's in the game thanks to a charity auction her father won as a fundraiser for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.


Littman said that, technically, this is still the first time female players are available in the game.
"We've never had the ability to create a female player. We had a girl whose picture and her name [were in the game] but the character was male," he said. "We didn't have the ability to create female characters. It's 100 percent true this is the first time you can put a woman in the game."
Littman said with the growth of women's hockey around the world, the time was right to include female players and satisfy a growing audience for the games and for hockey.
"We've introduced a lot of people to hockey. Not everyone's going to go to an NHL game or going to a game, but there are kids playing our game and getting introduced to hockey," he said.
"How awesome it was that a girl was playing our game with her brother and getting so much enjoyment out of it?"
Lexi Peters will no doubt enjoy it even more, now that she can finally be herself.

0 users disliked this comment caleb 4 minutes ago Report Abuse hey to be honest i do not play hockey game nor do i rlly like hockey but i think it is ok that they add this because lets say a sibling or friend that is a girl comes over and is playing and says they have a problem with not being able to be a girl character then this solves it and i understand some ppl are mad just get over it it is just a game. And i know what i am about to say about nba jam and i know its more arcade but you can be sara palin (idk if thats how u spell her name) and some thers but ya just get over the fact that you will be able to create girl hockey players and if you do not like that than dont get the game if you are going to whine about it.

Can't see how they're older than ten or so.   I remember I started liking girls when I was about that age, and had no complaints about them being in on games I played as a tween or teenager.

0 users disliked this comment pierre 16 minutes ago Report Abuse I'm sorry but licensed pro sports games are supposed to portray realism & the real life fact is that no women play in the NHL, NBA, NFL, or MLB. This is obviously why there has never been a create a female feature in any of those games. I mean it's cool and all that her complaints made to the head office & changes were made but I would consider she take that as a major win & go home. Probably also has something to with the fact that the NHL trails all other pro sports in popularity on U.S. soil, including NASCAR & the NHRA, good for Hockey fans, they can have this one...

0 users disliked this comment yeayeashowertime 24 minutes ago Report Abuse It's really funny how people are upset that this isn't "realistic" enough for them.   Come on people, you can put ANY legendary hockey player (such as my personal favorite - Steve Yzerman) onto any team roster.   How realistic is Stevie Y skating with Gordie Howe on a line with Datsyuk?   It's a vidjagame peeps, calm down.

0 users disliked this comment T 48 minutes ago Report Abuse I would like to know what the complaints are about.   Why does it change your game to add a capability that you choose not to use?   No one is forcing anyone to activate the female player avatars.   I don't see how it would slow the game down, and it isn't going to use much memory compared to the game itself.   Just what is the problem with having an option for girls if they want it?

0 users disliked this comment Gabriel 49 minutes ago Report Abuse I still chuckle thinking back to the time that Yzerman came up behind Esa Tikkannen and cross checked him ( this is after the play ) and Esa elbowed him in the face. Yzerman fell to the ice and laid there for about 10 minutes.

   The glorious days of hockey......

4 users disliked this comment Frill Artist 51 minutes ago Report Abuse Good! Now we can finally address the issue my 14 year old son has been having with a recent game I purchased for his birthday; Disney Princesses: A Kingdom Awaits. He recently discovered after playing through the entire game that he wasn't able to make his character a "boy princess". When I asked him, doesn't he mean a "Prince". He said "No, I want a boy princess. So I can dress him in pweedy dwesses." I urged him to write a letter to Disney Interactive. We are awaiting their response.

6 users disliked this comment laxr413  1 hour ago Report Abuse i don't care how "unfair" it is that there are no girl hockey players in the new NHL game, EA sports makes their games realistic (sort of) and in making their games realistic they should not put girls into the game. It's a fact of the real NHL, only once has a girl ever played in an NHL game, it was a preseason game, and she was a goalie. Needless to say, she didn't do very well. I've played hockey all my life and I can say the level between guys hockey and girl's hockey is astronomical. They can't skate on the same ice as guys.

So why in god's name would they put girls in? If there were a significant amount of girls in the pros, I'd understand that, but there is none. Not one, in any country or professional league in the world..  

More girls play basketball or baseball or even football and you don't see them crying to get put into MLB, NBA, or Madden video games. It's a stupid precedent they set that is just going to kill any future sports video game.

If this ever came into FIFA, you best believe I would be buying Pro Evo that year. When I buy a sports game, I want a representation of REAL LIFE. Not some barbie doll teenage girl's fantasy. Again, barf.

7 users disliked this comment Nick  1 hour ago Report Abuse The fact that you can play as Gretzkey and all these retired legends is really unrealistic but putting girls into modes where only men play in real life hockey is going overboard. Have a women's hockey mode if your so compelled to put females in.

So the call went out for more volunteer firefighters to join the effort from across the state. Before they arrived, however, the federal government showed up and claimed it was in charge of the situation. "Agents with the federal National Interagency Fire Center, a coalition of federal agencies including the US Forest Service, assumed command of firefighting efforts Tuesday afternoon," reports The Gonzales Cannon (www.gonzalescannon.com RealNewsReporter.com is now reporting that volunteer firefighters who had in some cases driven all night to reach Bastrop county were turned away by the feds, who claimed that since local officials never made a "formal request" for volunteers, the volunteers could not be "activated." So while Bastrop County burns from 40+ fires that are still raging, the federal government is actually telling volunteer firefighters to go home.

The most destructive wildfire on record in Texas showed no signs of slowing Monday, destroying 25000 acres in Bastrop County and more houses than any single wildfire, according to the Texas Forest Service. With more than 60 new wildfires raging across the state, including one that burned more than 210 acres in Stone Oak, Gov. Rick Perry left the presidential campaign trail Monday in South Carolina to address the public and organize requests for more federal aid. More than 1000 homes have been destroyed by the fires, more than all other fires this year combined have destroyed, officials said. Local fire officials blamed sparks from a San Antonio Water System truck that accidentally caught on fire for the Stone Oak blaze, which burned more than 210 acres in North Bexar County.

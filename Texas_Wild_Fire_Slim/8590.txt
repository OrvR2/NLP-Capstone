Since making its glamorous entrance into the wine world in 1987, this show stopping wine has attracted admiration from wine lovers and critics nationwide. In celebration of Marilyn Merlot’s 25th year, the Napa Valley winery is pleased to announce the September release of a special 2009 vintage of their highly acclaimed wine.  Presented in a silk-screen printed bottle featuring an alluring photograph of Marilyn Monroe and her embossed silver signature, this wine is sure to capture everyone’s attention.
“We are delighted to commemorate 25 years of success in the wine business. Although Marilyn’s career was short lived, her legacy is eternal. This vintage is a celebration of the similar timeless appeal of our wines, the lasting vitality of our business, and the perpetual quality of Napa Valley’s outstanding fruit,” says Bob and Donna Holder, founders of Marilyn Merlot. 
Typically released every year June (Marilyn Monroe’s birthday month) the special edition 2009 Marilyn Merlot released this September, just in time for the holidays.  An elegant bottle of Marilyn Merlot will make a fun and festive gift and keepsake for wine connoisseurs, collectors and Monroe fans alike.  Its personality and full-bodied flavor are guaranteed to lend style and spice to any holiday celebration. 
“We had an extraordinary growing season in Napa Valley during 2009, with most of our harvest occurring before the late October rains.  Sensational fruit means a quality wine, and we are delighted that our 2009 Marilyn Merlot will mark our 25th anniversary celebration,” comments John McKay, winemaker for Marilyn Merlot for the past 10 years. 
In addition to the special 25th Anniversary 2009 Marilyn Merlot, wine lovers should look forward to the 2010 Sauvignon Blonde.  This crisp and refreshing Sauvignon Blanc features the iconic image of Marilyn Monroe in her billowing white dress. Also look for the 2010 Norma Jeane, a young merlot that reflects the fresh and youthful charm of the young Marilyn Monroe. Though young, this Paso Robles-sourced wine is generous in flavor and richly elegant.

About Marilyn Merlot:
Marilyn Wines traces its origins to 1981, when a small group of friends started making wine at their home near St. Helena in the Napa Valley. Over the 25 years, continuing acclaim from critics, collectors, and lovers of fine wine have led to the production of Marilyn Merlot, Marilyn Cabernet, Norma Jeane, the Velvet Collection, Marilyn Blonde de Noirs, Marilyn Red Dress, and Marilyn Sauvignon Blonde. For more information, please visit http://www.marilynwines.com. 
About the Founders of Nova Wines Inc.: 
In the late 1970s, Bob and Donna Holder left behind their city lives, and purchased a small plot of land on the outskirts of Rutherford, California.  As longtime wine connoisseurs with successful backgrounds in the art and CPA business, the Holders became home winemakers in 1980.  Encouraged by the enthusiastic response to their wine by family and friends, the Holders decided to produce it commercially.  Adopting the clever name, “Marilyn Merlot”, the Holders received formal permission from Marilyn Monroe’s estate to use her name and image on the wine.  Publicly released in 1987, the wine quickly sold out, becoming a favorite among wine connoisseurs and Monroe fans alike.
Marilyn Merlot has continued to grow over the years, with the involvement of the Holder’s two sons.  Although the company has been asked to create wines in honor of other celebrities, it remains dedicated exclusively to the enduring Hollywood icon.  As the Holders remarked, “no one can capture the glamour of our merlot quite like Marilyn Monroe."

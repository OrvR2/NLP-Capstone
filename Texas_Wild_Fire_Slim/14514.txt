The whiteboard in A&M Consolidated High School room G-1280 announced to students that their lesson would be special on Friday: "History of Terrorism (9/11)".
But most of the students seemed to think nothing of it as they filed in for third period. The senior girls were busy applying blood red make-up and kissing each other's cheeks; it was "Kiss a Senior Day," they explained. The boys, outnumbered in the advanced class, took their seats silently. 
When the bell rang, history and economics teacher Jason Pratt asked his students a question: What makes a terrorist?
"Someone who causes terror," a student called out. His classmates laughed. 
"They are working to instill fear in others," another said. 
Pratt then displayed a picture of Osama Bin Laden. Why does he hate America, the young and energetic teacher asked. The answers came quickly. 
"Wasn't he from America?"
No. 
"We think we are untouchable."
Perhaps.
"Maybe the cultural values were a little different?" 
All the students raised their hands when Pratt asked who among them remembered 9/11. They were 6, 7, and 8 years old at the time, but about half said they were allowed to watch the horror unfold on television. One said his teacher cried in front of him. 
Still, it is unlikely that any of them understood what was happening. And only one said he had ever been taught a lesson about it at school. 
Americans are still affected by the terrorist attacks each time they fly on an airplane or hear news about two wars overseas. But the events are far enough away now that many teenagers and young adults are too young to remember the actual day. 
Now, 10 years later, the story of the violence of Sept. 11, 2001, is shifting from a current event to history, and teachers are adjusting accordingly. 
At A&M Consolidated, geography classes have been talking about it for years. When Islam is discussed, the subject of terrorism often follows. Teachers have worked to show students that terrorism isn't condoned by most Muslims, and many non-Muslims have also used terror as a tactic. 
But in May 2010, the State Board of Education adopted 9/11 into the statewide curriculum. Now, fifth-graders will touch on it when they learn about important world events of the last 200 years. Ninth-grade world history students will track the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and 11th-graders will review the day as a historical turning point and study the constitutional issues that arose in its aftermath. 
Prior to this year, there was no requirement to study the date. Professors at Texas A&M say they notice that in their students. 
Michael Alvard, an associate professor of anthropology, recently  asked his 78 students to identify the home country of most of the 9/11 hijackers. Only 15 percent correctly answered Saudi Arabia. (Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, the rest were from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt or Lebanon.)
Thirty-nine percent guessed Afghanistan and 5 percent said the United States. 
"What surprised me was that not as many people said Iraq," Alvard said. "Because when I did this in 2007, it was over 50 percent who thought it was Iraq that attacked us."
Alvard said he used the exercise to teach how misinformation can be institutionalized. 
At A&M, professors have leeway in how they design their courses, so they vary on how much they emphasize 9/11. 
Walter Kamphoefner, who teaches post-Civil War American history, said he doesn't cover it much. 
"Just one of a number of things I talk about on the last day of the semester," he said in an email. 
Terry Anderson, who teaches post-1945 American history, devotes an entire lecture to it. He said he discusses the threat of Islamic fundamentalism during the '90s, the first bombing of the World Trade Center and the rise of Bin Laden. Then he talks about the aims and nature of terrorism, and the missed opportunities and failures of the American government before and after the 9/11 attacks. 
Anderson, who has written essays and a book about the aftermath of the attacks, said he requires students to read the 9-11 Commission report and Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror by Richard Clarke. 
"The students I have today are as bright as any I have ever had," he said. "But as far as worldly events are concerned, they don't know anything at all ... They don't know much about 9/11 except what they were doing when it happened and where their families were."
Pratt's high school students had about the same amount of knowledge. But, as soon as he started the discussion, he could tell they were interested, he said. 
He tried to provide context for the attacks by also teaching about the formation of Israel, the Iranian Revolution, murder at the Munich Olympics, the Seven Day War and the bombings of U.S. embassies, the World Trade Center and the USS Cole. 
Then, he played an HBO documentary with footage from New York on the day of the attack. It showed the planes crashing, people leaping from the top floors of buildings, the twin towers collapsing and shocked survivors covered in ash. 
Pratt usually tries to avoid having his students watch or work on one thing for more than 10 minutes. Their iPhones, computers and social networking sites have shortened their attention spans, he said. After 15 minutes, he paused the video, but the students wanted to keep watching. So he played it until the bell rang. For the weekend, he gave his students only one homework assignment: "Reflect on how precious your life is."
Then the students, who entered class talking, laughing and kissing, exited in silence.

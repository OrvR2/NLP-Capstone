The Great Recession has hardly put the average American in a spending mood -- but some retailers have a knack for attracting new customers.
Looking at sales growth between 2009 and 2010, business and personal finance site Bundle.com has compiled a list of the country's top retailers. Many of the companies in the top 10 are online-based, but it may suprise some to learn that a good portion of the stores whose sales have grown the most sell their goods in places that customers can actually walk into.
Still, 2011 has been a tough year for retailers who do the majority of their sales face-to-face. In mid-July, bookseller Borders shuttered over 400 stores due to bankruptcy, putting 10,000 people out of work.
Likewise, "one-stop shopping stop" Wal-Mart has also struggled. The mega-store which every week averages 140 million customers nationwide saw sales decline over seven straight quarters, according to an April report by CNN Money.
Meanwhile, Amazon.com, an online retailer that's grown from selling books to now selling just about everything, saw the second largest sales gains in 2010, an increase of 46.2 percent.
For cities that shop the most online, check out this infographic from Bundle.com.
Looking ahead, consumer confidence may be a major concern for retailers as the summer dies down amid a highly volatile stock market. In July, consumer sentiment hit its lowest point in two years and with consumers becoming less prone to making big purchases due to uncertainty surrounding the market, things may only get worse. 
 Here are the ten hottest retailers by sales growth between 2009 and 2010, according to bundle.com:

				Overstock.­com?  Seriously?  Suckering people into believing they are getting a discount when in fact their proces are as much at 15% higher than anywhere else must be a good business model then.

I have never found anything on Overstock.­com that I could not find either on another etailer or local brick and mortar retailer for less.

				Amazon is not a "retailer" -- it's a distributo­r.  Amazon sells things you can buy directly from manufactur­ers and ensure the state tax is paid.  If you buy from Amazon it's the same as st-ealing revenue from that state.  Order directly from the manufactur­er and it will cost you no more and you will help support the state in which that manufactur­er operates.Opponents Seek Signatures to Overturn State 'Amazon Tax'July 20, 2011The newly signed budget bill may be repealed if enough signatures are gathered to put the tax before voters next fall.Opponents of the “Amazon Tax” have begun gathering signatures to overturn legislatio­n that would require Internet-o­nly retailers to collect sales tax on purchases by California residents.Secretary of State Debra Bowen gave the green light for groups to begin collecting signatures Monday.As part of the budget passed by the Legislatur­e and signed by the governor last month, the Amazon Tax would help bridge a $9.6 billion state deficit. http://gle­ndora.patc­h.com/arti­cles/oppon­ents-seek-­signatures­-to-overtu­rn-state-a­mazon-tax

				Yeah, sorry, no thanks.  But I do believe every state requires you to claim any purchase made either online or out of state and pay the sales tax that would be due to the stae where you reside.  Vehicles are easy because you have to register them in your state.  If you bought them out of state they will collect any sales tax difference bbefore they will give you your tags.  Other items, such as what Amazon markets, are not so easy.  

You don't need a new law, you just need a way to enforce the laws on the books.

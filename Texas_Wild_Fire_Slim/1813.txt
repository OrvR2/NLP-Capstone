Sierra Leone tourism profits soarAFP – Fri, Sep 2, 2011

Sierra Leone's tourism industry raked in $19 million in the first half of the year, an official said Friday, as the country lures travellers to its white beaches after a brutal civil war.
National Tourist Board (NTB) manager Cecil Williams told AFP this compared to $10 million dollars earned for the whole of 2010.
"But this figure is likely to be affected for the next six months due to the unprecedented seaweed disaster that has engulfed some of the country's pristine beaches in recent weeks," he said.
In recent weeks some of the country's beaches have been fouled by massive piles of seaweed, baffling scientists and prompting studies by the Sierra Leone Environmental Protection Agency (SLEPA) and the Senegalese-based Westland International Africa.
SLIEPA spokesman Edward Bendu told AFP: "It is a strange phenomenon and it has never happened on such a large scale. The rapidity with which the seaweeds are appearing on the coastal beaches is startling."
Williams said tourism was a significant contributor to the economy in a country which battles high unemployment, with some 5,000 employees in the industry sustaining up to 35,000 people.
"Hotels have done reasonably well and the occupancy of most of them increased due to keen competition."
Statistics from the World Travel and Tourism Centre projects that Sierra Leone's tourism industry will grow by 5.8 percent per year between 2010 and 2019.
The country, which for a decade was torn apart by one of Africa's bloodiest conflicts that ended in 2002, is rebuilding and attracting investors to its tourism industry as well as massive mineral wealth.
In 2009 the Lonely Planet guidebook ranked Sierra Leone as "one of the world's top 10 places to visit".
Six hours from London and Brussels and eight hours from the United States, the west African nation is trying to lure tourists with its lush tropical landscapes and 360-kilometre (220-mile) coastline of sandy beaches.

If Sierra Leone can earn $19 million dollars in tourism, there is no point complaining about seaweed, invasion by seaweed shows nothing is free. They should the money they earned from tourists using the white beaches to clear the seaweed and stop complaining.

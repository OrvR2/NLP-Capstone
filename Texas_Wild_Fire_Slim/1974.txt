A Temp Job Turns Into a Fight Against TerrorBy Jonathan CheskinPostsWebsiteBy Jonathan Cheskin | Yahoo! Contributor Network – 11 hrs ago






Yahoo! is asking Americans how September 11 changed them. Below is an account from a reader.


  Fall 2001 saw my wife and I move from Berkeley, Calif., to Kingston, N.Y., -- 90 miles north of NYC -- so that Elizabeth, a student at Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, could do a year-long seminary internship at a Lutheran church.


  I was a musician who had worked office day jobs in Berkeley, and I found myself wondering what I would do in Kingston for a year. In the process of looking for a cello teacher for myself and students to supplement our income, I took a temp job in the recreational permit office at the New York City Department of Environmental Protection in Kingston. I was planning to help them with customer service and clerical tasks related to issuing hunting and fishing permits for the reservoirs in the Catskill mountains that fed the New York City water supply.


  [Your story: How has September 11 changed you?]


  Then, the planes hit. I had been working on the job a very short time, and figured that the job was toast -- surely the mayor's office was going to close down all of the reservoirs, ergo, no permits (or permit clerical staff) needed. After the attacks, there was real fear that someone would try to bomb the reservoirs, or perhaps dump a load of chemicals or bio-weapons in, and the permit database was certainly not up to the task of providing the security officers with enough reliable information to keep the reservoirs safe.
  

  However, in the short time that I had worked in the office, some folks had noticed that I was a bit of a wizard in Microsoft Access, and someone had a bright idea -- could they get me to redesign the database to their specs, and then reissue all of the permits (some 50,000 of them)? The mayor's office really wanted to keep the reservoirs open as a sign of normalcy that could help the city recover. There was no budget for the project, but perhaps the temp (me) would be willing to do it?
  

  For perhaps the first time in my life, I found myself in the position of having a direct means of helping my country fight a war. Of course I agreed to do it. I designed the database, managed a staff of four other temps and succeeded in reissuing all of the permits in two months. The security folks thought the database was adequate (although it creaked and groaned a bit as Access doesn't like databases with that many records), and the mayor's office was able to reopen the reservoirs in time for deer season in January. I got a huge nod of appreciation from the office before I quit the job to move back to Berkeley in July.
  

  To this day, I am still stunned at how an event like September 11 was able to give me a unique opportunity. If there is a positive side to something this horrible, it is that it can sometimes provide the circumstance to bring out hidden potential from people. I am also not just talking about myself -- for although I think I did make a difference, I did not provide a decisive difference just on my own. In the process of working in the office, I spoke to hundreds of New Yorkers regarding their hunting and fishing seasons. I explained, "I am sorry to say that the reservoirs are temporarily closed due to security concerns." In every case, I was greeted with courtesy and a steely resolve. I'll never forget Vinnie from Queens (this was his real name!): "Closed to protect the reservoirs, we understand! Let us know when we can return and if we can help you look for those guys up there. God Bless America!"


  The New Yorkers could actually have done fine without me, but I am glad I was able to help restore some normalcy to their lives in a small way. Peace to them all in this difficult anniversary.

Somali militants captured 2 Kenyan soldiersAP – 16 hrs ago





MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — An Islamist militia in Somalia say they have captured two Kenyan soldiers near the country's shared border.The al-Shabab militia posted a statement on a commonly used militant website Wednesday saying they caught the two men on a surveillance mission near the Somali town of Dhobley.There was no way to immediately verify the militants' claims since Kenyan officials could not be reached. It was not clear exactly when the men were taken.A thin sliver of southern Somalia along the Kenyan border is held by a militia allied to the weak U.N.-backed government, which is fighting al-Shabab.That militia receives extensive support from the Kenyan government, who consider al-Shabab a security threat to Kenya.

Only a word of the capture, no ransom demands? Must not be doing to badly with food (as they demand 1/3 of what the UN and other charities hands out). Must be running out of general public to tourcher. Just think, the land is nice and flat,, you would get the full 50 mile radius effect from a 5 megaton hydrogen reaction at 3000 feet above the ground.

Happy birthday, Pippa!
Today the famous Middleton sis turns the big 2-8 and to celebrate, we're looking back at a year of Pippa Style. 
Although it may have been her 28th year, this was really the beginning of Pippa Middleton as we know her. On April 29, as everyone awaited Kate Middleton's big arrival at her Royal Wedding to Prince William, the world got a surprise in the form of maid-of-honor Pippa and her perky derriere.
Since then the world's gone mad for Pips and her enviable figure and style. From magazine covers and replicas built from food to an adult film offer and a made-for-TV special, Pippa Middleton has gotten the royal treatment in 2011.
But, of course, we love Pippa most for her style -- chic and simple, on-trend yet timeless. The sleeveless shift dresses, shiny designer sunglasses, luxe leather bags and sophisticated flats (along with permanently bronzed skin) have become this famous sister's signature look. 
Take a look below at our favorite Pippa looks from this past year!

				She is a beautiful, young lady who looked great in every one of those pictures.W­hy are there so many negative and hurtful posts? I wasnt interested in her sisters wedding and I certainly dont follow her, I have no idea whats going on with the royal couple, but to bad mouth her because her sister married royalty, keeping the medias attention directed towards her,  you see pictures and read articles, whether you want to or not but that doesnt make her a nobody, or any of the other nasty names she is being called. She didnt ask to be in the spotlight because of her sister's marriage but if she is and she is loving it, why not? Wouldnt you? What is she doing thats so wrong? She isnt doing anything, its what the media is doing by keeping her in the spotlight, get mad at them.

				This "Pippa" obsession is so strange.  Is this just some sort of media creation?  I just cannot see people all over the world being so enamored with this person.  Is she attractive­?  Yes, maybe in a girl next door kind of way.  Beautiful or gorgeous?  Not in my opinion.  She looks like she is in her mid-30's rather than 28.  Frankly, I think her sister is much better looking.

				Pippa looks great in everything except black. She has fairly lackluster coloring, doesn't wear much make up, and needs color to spark her up. She looked fabulous at her sister's wedding because Pippa was wearing off-white and was made up for a change.

She also frequently looks like a fashion victim - she should develop her own style and stick with it. She is a great model for fitness, deportment­, and confidence however - a real tribute to the rising middle class in Britain.

				She's "cute", somewhat attractive­, but certainly nothing special, extraordin­ary or worthy of any of the attention she's getting.  Not that only fashion models are beautiful, but I would venture to say that every fashion model on the planet (and there are thousands of them) is far-far prettier than Pippa.  So what's with all the attention?  She's just a cute girl, period.  To all those making a fuss over her: move on to something else; get a life!

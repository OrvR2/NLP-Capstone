HAYWARD -- 
A Union City woman made her first court appearance Friday on a murder charge in the slaying of a nursing student who vanished from a Hayward parking garage more than three months ago.
Giselle Esteban, 27, who is pregnant, did not enter a plea and spoke only to confirm the details of her legal representation.
"Public defender - I'm not quite sure," Esteban told Judge Michael Gaffey during a brief hearing in Alameda County Superior Court in Hayward. 
The judge ordered her to return to court Monday. She is being held in isolation at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin not because of her pregnancy, but because of the high-profile nature of the case, said sheriff's Sgt. J.D. Nelson.
 Esteban is accused of killing her former high school friend Michelle Le, 26, of San Mateo, whose body hasn't been found. 
 Esteban has said she hated Le and blamed her for ruining her relationship with her former boyfriend Scott Marasigan, who is the father of her 5-year-old daughter. But she denied any involvement with Le's disappearance.
 Marasigan attended Friday's hearing but left without commenting.
 Le's brother, Michael Le, and cousin Krystine Dinh sat in the front row of the gallery. After the hearing, Dinh said, "Our focus is still bringing Michelle home. This whole entire thing has been incredibly difficult."
 Le was last seen around May 27, when she went to her car during a break in a clinical lesson at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Hayward. Police believe that Esteban, Le's former classmate at Mount Carmel High School in San Diego, killed her in the hospital's parking garage.
 Esteban's first court appearance was rescheduled from Thursday, when a pregnancy-related health issue kept her from court. 
Although it is unusual to have pregnant murder defendants, it's not unprecedented.
Another woman, Tiffany Lopez, 20, is being held at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin on a murder charge for allegedly smothering her 2-year-old daughter out of frustration because the little girl wouldn't stop crying. At the time of her arrest last year, she was three months' pregnant.
Steve Clark, a former Santa Clara County prosecutor now a defense attorney, said housing pregnant defendants can be a "logistical nightmare" because "being in custody on a murder charge isn't exactly well-baby care. This isn't a transitory issue, this is something that is a permanent situation."
 Accommodations have to be made for the birth and postnatal care, including breast-feeding, Clark said. 
 Inmate pregnancies are handled case-by-case, Nelson said. Some women who give birth "want absolutely nothing to do with that baby," while others want to bond with their newborn, he said.
Some infants are immediately removed by Child Protective Services over concerns that the mother is unfit, Nelson said.

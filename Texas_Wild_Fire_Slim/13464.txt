ÂŠ 2009 WMG Monster (Video)
Video Rating: 4 / 5
 



bit.ly – Click to Subscribe to ClevverMusic! Was Kanye’s latest music video too racy for MTV? Hear what West himself had to say about the rumor. Yo guys, I’m Bridget Daly for ClevverMusic. So what’s the deal with Kanye’s Monster video never making it to television? Rumors started swirling this week that the vid was deemed too racy by MTV. But the network has since spoken out about it, denying the claims. An MTV rep said in a statement, “MTV has not banned Kanye West’s ‘Monster’ video. We have been in constant communication with the label regarding this matter. However, we are still awaiting the edits we requested in order for the video to be suitable for broadcast.” Monster has been streaming online since December, with the gory video featuring Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, and images of decapitated women and zombies feasting on flesh. The video borrowed from horror movies like Saw, Night of the Living Dead and American Psycho. There’s a good visual! Perhaps that’s the reason MTV needed a slightly more TV-friendly version of the vid before agreeing to air it. It’s not like Kanye to compromise, but if he wants Monster to see the light of day on MTV, he’d better make some changes! Have you seen the gruesome video? If so, sound off in the comments on what you think of it, and if it’s too racy for television. Click subscribe on our channel while you’re at it, and I’ll see you guys back here with more buzz. For ClevverMusic I’m Bridget Daly.

1st of Marchďťż isďťż Justin Bieber’sďťż birthday. This little roach hasďťż been infectingďťżďťż the wholeďťż world. Because ofďťż him, the worldďťż of rock is extincting.
So on hisďťż birthday, we all will go to his “Baby” officialďťż video and push the ‘dislike’ button so that the ‘dislike’ bar becomes 10 times bigger than the ‘like’ bar.
If you are a rockďťż fan, joinďťż with me and thumbs up me, copy-paste this message to allďťż rockďťż videos. We have six months toďťż unite and fight against this little cockroach

And to add onto the point i had about the video being titled “MONSTER” uh…. Katy Perry’s song… FIREWORKS had guess what…. FIREWORKS…. Its okay for things to not always be so upbeat and happy, horror movies sell great… why… ppl like to explore the darker side of humanity…  Its a song/poem/story/idea  it can be how ever twisted the author wants it to be. If you don’t like it, turn the fucking channel, or just shut the fuck up.

Sigh, people just cant seem to grasp concepts out side normal behavior. It is just a music video. The song is called “MONSTER” let me try to think of some monsters in our society…. usually they are all killers.  White girls or not who cares, I didn’t even notice it until i started reading comments. Stop looking at things so critical, a music video can not hurt anyone, grow up its not like he actually killed them IRL.

Thank you @tobiasgough!
racy means slightly improper or indelicate; suggestive; risquĂŠ.
NOT RACIST meaning hatred or intolerance of another race  or other races.
They are not the same. Kanye West isn’t racist. fuck haha

@deadithink I’ll explain it to you. If you support someone who is depicted killing white women in a video, you might be a sellout. If you fund a person who hates you, you might be a sellout. If you would rather support someone who hates your kind, rather then support your own people, you might be a sellout.

Is Kanye a necrophiliac now?? Those women or “actresses” were definitely told to act dead.. How much more shit does he have to put into his videos before people realize how fucked up him, jay-z, and  the mainstream music industry is?

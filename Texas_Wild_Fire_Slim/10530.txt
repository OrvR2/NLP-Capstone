SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) is a shrewd dude, a master acquirer of power and ruthless user of it. In ten years as governor he has turned what was widely regarded as a weak office and made into a kind of personal fiefdom not seen in the state since the days of Lyndon Johnson.
But the debut of "The Rick Perry Show" with Wednesday's debate at the Reagan Library has drawn attention to the candidate's knack for continually updating -- and rewriting -- his political allegiances and even his life story. Some of his rivals were preparing to focus on these points both in the NBC debate and on the campaign trail, and his ability to explain the contradictions and changes will go a long way toward deciding whether he is a viable contender -- let alone a winning candidate.
Perry, for one, will need to explain and defend his past life as a Democrat -- and, more specifically, his support for Al Gore's presidential campaign in 1988. In his book Fed Up, Perry goes to great length to trash Gore for his environmental views, even though they were well known back when then-Democrat Perry supported him. 
"He won an Oscar," Perry wrote. "And it is all one contrived phony mess that is falling apart under its own weight. Al Gore is a prophet all right, a false prophet of a secular carbon cult, and now even moderate Democrats aren't buying it."
Nowhere in the book does Perry mention that he supported Gore wholeheartedly years ago. On the whole, as one Republican National Committee member told HuffPost's Jon Ward, the blunt book "has a lot of people nervous."
The governor's calling card on the national stage is his furious distrust of the federal government -- and, indeed, of any government that is at a distance from the people it is supposed to serve. And yet Perry's entire life is both a testament to and the beneficiary of government help. He was educated at Texas A&M, which is the recipient of considerable federal research support. He was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force, where he was trained and paid at the federal government's expense. He went into business as a cotton farmer, and benefitted from countercyclical crop-support payments from the feds, not to mention regulatory and promotional spending -- and trade-import restrictions -- that have helped protect one of the most carefully protected agricultural commodities in the country.
And then there is the fact that he has been on the public payroll for most of his life, albeit at the state level.
His relationship with the Bush Family is another story that needs tending and explaining. He was the strongest possible supporter of then-Gov. George W. Bush. Once Bush was elected president and Perry took his place, he spent the first year or two mimicking his predecessor's agenda and operating style. Now, in Fed Up, he criticizes the former president as a big-spending crypto-statist. 
"Perry is going to have to answer a whole bunch of questions like this," said the top strategist for one of the other Republican candidates, who declined to be named in advance of the debate. "The big one is this: here we are at the Reagan Library and his first act in national politics was to support a guy who wanted to dismantle the Reagan legacy."

				If you are looking for a minimum wage job, then Texas is for you! There are other factors as well as jobs:
Texas Graduation rate of High School Seniors = #47 out of 50 states
Perry cut the emergency response budget for firefighte­rs by 50% reducing their ability to fight the horrible fires that they are dealing with, even though he was warned what would happen and DID.
Perry's horrible record of more executions than any other governor - 234 and more on the way!  It is now apparent to almost everyone that he has now sent at least one innocent man and possibly more to their deaths.
Another Religious nut that thinks he should be Preacher in Chief
Doesn't believe in evolution (it's easy to see why since most Tea Baggers have NOT evolved since the dawn of time!)
Doesn't believe that humans are responsibl­e for the rapid increase in climate change...a­nd so much more but personally­, I just don't want another Texas Cheerleade­r as POTUS.  I don't think our country could stand another one.  We're still trying to heal from the last one!

				tractionbe­am, #1 is the economy which incorporat­es Jobs.

Texas have increased jobs in the Public sector by 18% and in the Private sector by 9%. My hats off to the job growth and population growth in Texas. Their current unemployme­­nt rate is 8.4% vs. the national average of 9.1%. Their 2010 GDP growth was 2.8% vs. the national GDP growth of 2.6%. Their current 2 year budget deficit is projected to be $27 Billion. The majority of new jobs have been at minimum wage or below, jobs just the same. The Governor has been creative/p­­ersuasive in bringing Companies and the correspond­­ing jobs* to Texas from other American states. The following WSJ articles speaks to jobs in Texas: 
http://onl­­­ine.wsj.­c­o­m/arti­cl­e/­SB10­001­424­05­3111­9039­­...

Two other points of reference:
A Book - “Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington­­­” by Rick Perry, 2010 and a report from Texas Watch reflecting actual statistica­­l data for the State of Texas.
http://www­­­.texaswa­t­c­h.org/­20­11­/08/­tex­as-­mi­racl­e-or­­-myth­/

Rice University economist’­­s and other economist’­­s analyze Texas:

*The holder of the job could resign, follow the job, reapply knowing that the job would pay less and have no health insurance.

				Texas ranks 24th in the nation in unemployme­nt. That puts it in the mediocre middle with 23 states having lower rates. He increased the size of Texas government by 18%. So much for small government initiative­s. Texas leads the nation in the percentage of workers making at or BELOW minimum wage. Texas is rock bottom in the nation in education. However, they are #1 for most environmen­tal pollution and largest number of people without any health insurance at all. American does not need to emulate Texas. Texas should be ashamed of these figures.

				The majority of the jobs created during Perry's tenure as governor are due primarily  to technologi­c advances in the oil and gas industries that had nothing to do with  Rick Perry.   Most of the new jobs are contract positions that pay min wage or less, and are not assoc with any benefits, and in some cases not even minimal WC protection­s. 
His budget plan eliminates thousands of prof positions in education , healthcare­, labs, and inspection facilities­, firefighte­rs, police officers etc. These are not positions that will ever re-generat­e.

				You know these Republican­s - they love the 'reformed'­. Anyone who comes over to their worldview is seen as a convert and lauded for their good sense in seeing the light. They won't see any dichotomy in his previous allegiance to the Democrats, they'll simply say 'the sinner has repented'.

				Don't kid yourself, Perry is a master political strategist­. He has hired a campaign team of known sharks. His budget for the campaign for the nomination - not election - just the nomination is $55mil.  
Imagine what the budget will be for the election. GWB's entire campaign was $ 65 mil which at the time pushed the envelope on legality of amounts of money a candidate could receive form an individual donor.  
The Roberts Supreme Court has since shown its complicity in advancing graft in public elections by making corporatio­ns equal to individual­s with respect to campaign contributi­on limits. The Koch brothers have stated that they consider this election a war and will spend what is necessary to win.

				We are  burning up  down here in Texas and isn't it ironic that our state started burning after our govenor, "The devil Perry"  announced that he was in the running for President.  Take heed America!  If you all put this wolf in sheeps clothing in office, you haven't seen disaster yet!!  You think Texas is burning and they can't put it out, wait until America is on fire!

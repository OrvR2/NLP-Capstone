Sep 16, 2011: 
Message from Federal Coordinating Officer Kevin L. Hannes
 
To the survivors of the recent wildfires that began Labor Day weekend, I want to assure you that as the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) for FEMA Disaster 4029, I am here to support the State and local leadership in providing required assistance to all eligible survivors.  I will be working jointly with the State Coordinating Officer (SCO) and local officials in the designated counties to identify needs and bring assistance quickly. We will leverage all levels of our government – at the federal, state and local level - and the private sector to support the survivors of the devastating wildfires. We are employing a “whole community” approach to this response and recovery that has survivors at the forefront of our decisions.

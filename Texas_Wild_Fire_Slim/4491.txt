                     Beginning of Story Content The number of homes destroyed by a Texas wildfire has risen to 1,554 and is expected to further increase as officials enter more areas where the blaze has been extinguished, officials said Sunday. Seventeen people remain unaccounted for. Bastrop County officials joined by Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett sought to provide new information to hundreds of residents evacuated from their homes a week ago when blustering wind whipped up by...

Visit my blogspot at: www.Alistun.blogspot.com I decided to make an Inspirational Video for the class Blaze Wizard to motivate people and so here it is. =] Many people have bugged me about what equips I wore on my Blaze Wizard. So here's your chance to see it at the beginning of the video. My equips are actually quite simple... In case people might ask me for the map names in this video, I'll include it here 1) Hidden Street: Blue Wyvern's Nest 2) Zipangu: Encounter with the Buddha 3) Crimsonwood Mountain: Crimsonwood Keep 4) Aqua Road: Deep Sea Gorge II 5) Time Lane: Road of Regrets 5 *Due to questions that may follow of how I reached the Time Temple map without being Lvl 130, I might as well answer it here. I used a VIP Rock to get to that map. =] And for those who don't read the description boxes, I'll let you wonder about this. ;D

*EXCLUSIVE* "Girls, Girls, Girls" Was Originally For Ghostface. Jay-Z & Eminem In Studio

www.thehiphopchronicle.com In the second part of my interview with Just Blaze & Alchemist, I ask the duo on who passed on their beats. Just Blaze said Bleek passed on "Oh Boy", Beanie Sigel, Freeway & Jay-Z passed on "Pump It Up" but what I didn't know what "Girls, Girls, Girls" was originally for Ghostface. Flipside was originally Oschino and Freeway. Alchemist tells me that Rico Suave on "Feel The Vibrations" At this point Just Blaze & Alchemist school me on "uniblab". We all know the Craig Mack lyric ("Just...like...uniblab") but I never knew what uni-blab was. But its from the Jettsons. I ask the duo the first time they heard one of their beats being played on the radio. Alchemist shouts out Stretch & Bobbito, while Just remembers Mase's "Harlem World" as the first beat being used in a video. And finally I ask Just to break down the difference between Jay-Z & Eminem in the studio. It's interesting what Just says about the industry being 40% about talent and 60% people skills.

I live within the fire I'll overcome that wall Everything that belongs to us who are eager Say goodbye to the comfortable days And go confirm that meaning Because a long journey is waiting, we'll vow to each other Defy the time that sleeps at the edge of the flickering heavens, and advance to it Even if an inextinguishable fire dances and beckons me to time's wandering While I'm still unstable, I'll kick apart the road Even if I get lost in the redness and writhe in agony due to tomorrow's infinity Because the truth of my chest in here and yearning for it- If I can go and powerfully nurture The hope that sprouted within my wavering eyes hit bull's-eye!!

Latest updates say 26 police officers have been injured and 43 people arrested as violent riots flared up in north London. Two patrol cars, a building and a double-decker bus were torched as rioters clashed with officers on Saturday in front of the Tottenham Police Station, where people had gathered to demand "justice" for the death of a man identified locally as Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old father of four, killed in an apparent gunfight. More than 300 were involved in what began as a march to demand justice for the killing. Shops were also looted.

Visit my blogspot at: www.Alistun.blogspot.com READ THE DESCRIPTION FOR MORE DETAILS ON TRAINING PLACE GUIDE. Many people have asked me where did I train at certain levels and how I leveled so fast to 120 in just 5 days, so I decided to make a video depicting EVERY training spot I used for my Blaze Wizard. Keep in mind that these are the training maps I used and recommend, but they are NOT the only ones available. There are many other training spots, so don't limit yourselves. ;) Lvl 10 - 20 These 10 levels should be a total breeze. Do some quests from Henesys and Nautilus. For those who don't like quests, go into the Pig Dungeon and train there. The exp is great, you should be able to 1 hit KO them with Magic Claw, if not 2 hit KO. Lvl 20 - 30: Here, I recommend four training spots. The 1st one is wild boars. At this level, you wouldn't be able to hit the Jr. Boogies, so I recommend going up to the rock and break it so that all the Jr. Boogies are dead. Wild Boars drop Split Bullets, which you can sell for slight profits. The 2nd one is the Horny Mushroom + Zombie Mushroom Dungeon. I abosolutely loved this map because the summon was great. Your summon skill "Flame" comes in real handy with the mobing. The 3rd one is Scorpions. The map is flat and has a constant spawn, so the exp is great. If for some reason, you miss on Scorpions, go to Sand Rats which is only 2 portals to the left of the Scorpion's. The 4th one being Axe Stumps. The map with the Area Boss "Stumpy" in it <b>...</b>

Magnitude-6.4 earthquake rattles Vancouver IslandBy Tamsyn Burgmann, The Canadian Press | The Canadian Press – Fri, 9 Sep, 2011





VANCOUVER - Perry Schmunk was standing on low-lying, idyllic beach near Tofino, B.C., on Friday afternoon watching ocean waves swell and chatting with a guest at his Vancouver Island resort when the soft sand shifted below their feet.A nearby log rolled. A "look of seriousness" passed over the pair's faces.Just off the island's coast, the earth was moving, the result of a magnitude-6.4 earthquake that was felt well into British Columbia's Interior."The best way I can describe it is the ground turned, it was like you were standing on a waterbed," he said in a phone interview from the Long Beach Lodge, where he works as the general manager."It shook — not violently, but it started rolling significantly for about half a minute. It went on for quite a while."There were no immediate reports of damage and no tsunami warning.The earthquake struck at 12:41 p.m. local time about 50 kilometres off the west coast of Vancouver Island, according to the United States Geological Survey. Smaller aftershocks followed.The precise magnitude of the earthquake shifted throughout the day as seismologists in Canada and the United States revised their data. Initial reports put it at a magnitude-6.7 quake, but that was changed several times.British Columbians living in parts of the Island and as far east as Kelowna and Kamloops reported feeling the tremor.It also wobbled the upper floors of Vancouver's City Hall and even gave pause to people in Seattle, said Heather Lyle, who runs provincewide earthquake drills with Emergency Management BC."It has been widely felt — mild swaying — but there are no reports of damage or injuries anywhere," she said, noting she didn't experience any shaking in her office in suburban Surrey, southeast of Vancouver.Susan Lambert, president of the B.C. Teachers' Federation, felt three successive waves on the third floor of the Vancouver office building where she works."At first, you're putting it down to a truck rolling by or hitting the building, but then we were pretty sure it was an earthquake," she said."We did start to wonder if we should duck and cover, but then it subsided."The shaking was caused by what's known as a crustal earthquake, which means it was believed to have occurred in the top 15 kilometres of the earth's crust.That sort of quake isn't unusual for the region, said Garry Rogers, an earthquake scientist with the Geological Survey of Canada.Rogers, who is based in the Vancouver Island community of Sidney, said hundreds of much smaller quakes happen in the same region each year.Those quakes are sparked by the sideways shifting of two tectonic plates, called the Juan de Fuca and Explorer plates, along a boundary called the Nootka Fault.Tsunamis only occur when plates shift up and down, raising mass amounts of ocean water.The last quake similar-sized quake in the region was recorded in November 2004, said Rogers. He said quakes of that size occur in the area about once a decade.Rogers added people in the area shouldn't be surprised if they feel smaller trembles in the coming week."There's a certainty there will be aftershocks," he said. "Already, we've had half-a-dozen, with the largest being 4.9. But there's going to be hundreds of aftershocks ... potentially measured over the next week."The seismic event was exponentially smaller than the massive megathrust earthquake and subsequent tsunami that ravaged Japan in early March.Even though the quake caused more Twitter buzz than real damage, Prof. Brent Ward of Simon Fraser University said it should serve as a strong reminder that west coast residents live in earthquake country."It's kind of a cautionary wake up call that people need to be prepared for a larger quake," said Ward, who teaches in the university's earth sciences department. "Because we will get one eventually."Many experts agree the next Big One is overdue.Between federal, provincial and municipal governments, there are numerous quake emergency response plans in place, though they aren't consistent.A provincial autodialer that makes 1,000 calls in 20 minutes to everyone from RCMP to the coast guard went into action on Friday, and hundreds of emails and faxes were also sent immediately as well.The next B.C. earthquake drill happens on Oct. 20, and will occur in tandem with drills in California, Utah and Nevada.

Good news is that in the areas where there are frequent low intensity eathqukes, high intensity earthquakes do not occur. Because the tension in tectonic plates are relieved by frequent slight motion rather than one massive jerk.

So relax and enjoy the West Coast life.

Dude, the earthquake measuring guys must be out of their mind. I have lived through many earthquakes and magnitide 6.7 is a very strong earthquake by all standards. It should rattle windows and sway tall buildings for hundreds of kilometers from the epicentre. I did not feel a thing in Vancouver BC area and know of none who had felt it. Its a big lie or the guys at the office can not read their instruments. Like everywhere around here the guys with proper training and education get nowhere while some blue eyedboy (with nothing in his head) gets all the good jobs. So much so for employment equality in BC.

When this really does happen on the coast (I mean the big kahuna), there is going to be much hurt. I heard about the Isle is going to sink, the San andreas fault gonna drop, tidal waves, earthquakes, 30 years ago. With Vancouver's luck it would happen in game 7 against the Bruins! Kidding aside this is only a precurser of events. Face it people, the winds of change are upon us, Tsunamis, Earthquakes, Taliban, Islam, forest fires, tornados, etc..

B.C. still recommends getting under tables and desks etc in the event of a big one.  This is a great way to die - the table or desk collapses and you're crushed.  To survive, you lie down alongside a big piece of furniture - table, desk, couch, bed etc  and you will have a triangle of life.  It's time the B.C. "experts" spoke to the people who really know, the Californians instead of giving bad advice.

Ok, this isn't doomsaying, this has nothing to do with religion but everything to do with "the ring of fire"....   First japan,  then alaska, then BC...   looks like the entire plate is reseting or settling ...  So next one will likely be in Sanfransico or LA...  then one in mexico

BW, Why don't you shut up! Earthquakes happen here and there but it has nothing to do with hell...Hell only exist in your stupid mind not in the mind of GOD...It is grave insult to our heavenly father believing that He created a hell to torture us.

Brian, I have only one question to you: Do you really believe that your being scared is going to help the future approaching so quickly? I know, you say you pray, but do you do that with the joy, or rather the fear... Just to add: I was born not yesterday, I had lived through many challenging times, and I have enough wisdom to understand that those who are scared are easily to control by many... My heart is open to all humanity with clarity and Love without fear, and I am so greatful for that! If I had my last few months of my life left, I would rather spend it on enjoying it and sharing it with anyone who would like to be a part of that (praying, or just meditating...). I am not going to bite my nails, cry, and be mad at my destiny, but I would continue doing the best I can in the positive attitude without judgments and regrets, hoping for the best outcome for all of us... With Peace and Love in my heart!

We really do not what is our near future. Instead of spending my time on being scared of unknown and worrying about this, I trust our future on this Planet is going to be the best for all of us, and I enjoy every breath of mine... And yes, Monique, the Planet we live on is a very beautiful place to be... I love walking by the Ocean every day in my spare time, enjoy smiling to my surrounding and feeling peaceful, because I chose not to be scared... It feels great! Whatever comes in the future, I will deal with that, but for now, I enjoy the moment...

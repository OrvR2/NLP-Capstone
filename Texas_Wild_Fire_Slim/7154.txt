BASTROP - Emotions ran high Saturday as the most destructive wildfire in Texas history ravaged the area for a seventh day.
After spending nearly a week wondering whether his home had been destroyed, George Gaydos got the news Saturday: His house had burned down.
But Gaydos - who has been living at a hotel with his wife, two children and father since fleeing nearly a week ago - still can't return to see what is left.
Fire crews made progress Saturday fighting the Bastrop wildfire, but concerns over still smoldering hot spots have kept thousands from going home.
Tensions flared during a news conference Saturday as some residents shouted questions at county officials, demanding to know when they could return to their homes. But the room erupted in cheers when Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald confirmed that President Barack Obama had issued a major disaster declaration for Texas, allowing FEMA to start releasing funds to victims.
Gov. Rick Perry was expected to appear Saturday afternoon in Bastrop to comment on the disaster declaration but canceled. Spokeswoman Allison Castle cited "logistical reasons," noting that the site of the conference was moved hours before the event.
As of Saturday's briefing, 622 structures were confirmed destroyed. The fire was 40 percent contained.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Firefighters have yet to control Texas wildfireBy JIM VERTUNO - Associated Press,MICHAEL GRACZYK - Associated Press | AP – 19 hrs ago

BASTROP, Texas (AP) — One of the most destructive wildfires in Texas history is slowing down thanks in part to calming winds, but stretched-thin firefighting crews have yet to gain any control of the blaze that is plowing across rain-starved grasslands now littered with hundreds of charred homes.Raging with zero containment for days, the wind-fueled fire has destroyed more than 600 homes and blackened about 45 square miles in and around Bastrop, a city near Austin. An elite search team on Wednesday will begin looking for more possible victims of the fire, which has killed two people and forced thousands to evacuate.Crews finally got a reprieve Tuesday from winds pushed in by Tropical Storm Lee that whipped the blaze into an inferno over the weekend. Increased humidity was moving in overnight, and officials were expected to report some containment in the morning, Texas Forest Service spokesman John Nichols said."Tonight should be a good night, tomorrow should be a good day — we hope," Nichols said late Tuesday. "The reason why it hasn't been able to be contained is the wind. We still have a lot of active fire on the line, but today was the first day we had very light wind."The blaze is the most catastrophic of the more than 180 fires that have erupted in the past week across Texas, marking one of the most devastating wildfire outbreaks in state history. The fires have destroyed more than 1,000 homes, caused four deaths and pulled the state's firefighting ranks to the limit.In a housing development near Bastrop, Willie Clements' two-story colonial home was reduced to a heap of metal roofing and ash. A picket fence was melted. Some goats and turkeys survived, but about 20 chickens and ducks died in a coop that went up in flames."We lost everything," said Clements, who with his family took a picture of themselves in front of a windmill adorned with a charred red, white and blue sign that proclaimed, "United We Stand.""This is the beginning of our new family album," the 51-year-old said.Texas Gov. Rick Perry cut short a high-profile presidential campaign trip to South Carolina to deal with the crisis, and on Tuesday toured a blackened area near Bastrop, about 25 miles from Austin. He later deployed Texas Task Force 1, the same search team sent to New York following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina."Pretty powerful visuals of individuals who lost everything," Perry said after the tour. "The magnitude of these losses are pretty stunning."The conservative Republican said he expects federal assistance with the wildfires but complained that red tape was keeping available bulldozers and other heavy equipment at the Army's Fort Hood, about 75 miles from Bastrop. The post was fighting its own 3,700-acre blaze.White House spokesman Jay Carney said the Obama administration has approved seven federal grants to help Texas with the latest wildfires.About 1,200 firefighters battled the blazes, including crews from as far away as California and Oregon. Five heavy tanker planes, some from the federal government, and three aircraft capable of scooping 1,500 gallons of lake water at a time also helped.The disaster is blamed largely on Texas' yearlong drought, one of the most severe dry spells the state has ever seen. The fire in Bastrop County is the most devastating wildfire in Texas in more than a decade, eclipsing a blaze that destroyed 168 homes in North Texas in April.At least 11 other fires exceeded 1,000 acres Tuesday, including an 8,000-acre blaze that destroyed at least six homes in Caldwell County, next to Bastrop County. In far northeast Texas' Cass County, a 7,000-acre fire burned in heavy timberland. And in Grimes County, about 40 miles northwest of Houston, a 3,000-acre fire destroyed nearly two dozen homes and threatened hundreds more.In at least one neighborhood in Bastrop, flames hop-scotched a street where houses were tucked among oaks, pines and cedar trees. The Postal Service delivered mail to burned homes where only mailboxes were left standing.John Chapman's home on about 20 acres was only singed and had some smoke damage, but the vintage-car collector lost about 175 vehicles he kept in a garage or under pole barns. His losses included about a dozen Corvettes and a Shelby Cobra.As ashes swirled and tree stumps still spit flames, the 70-year-old Chapman pointed out the melted remains of a 1966 Pontiac GTO, a '57 Chevrolet pickup and a 1947 Studebaker pickup, and said: "You can either laugh or you can cry. You might as well laugh.""The house is safe, my wife and I are alive and good, and I'm not going to worry about it," he said.About 40 people who fled their homes were staying at a community center in the town of Paige. A volunteer, Debbie Barrington, said some people have been sleeping outside on picnic tables under a pavilion, eating food and using toiletries donated by folks not hurt by the fires."The first night, we had a child 17 months old," she said. "We didn't have milk. The next morning, I think we had eight gallons. People heard what we needed and brought it in. The response has been unreal."___Michael Graczyk reported from Houston.

1000 homes burned to the ground, thousands of people homeless, animals dying , and "people"  are interested in enlightening others about their political views !! I guess is much easier to hate than to love ... And God forbid if you show any sign of compasion, after all is really hard to be human ...

You're damn right I take pleasure from this ironic tragedy. Anyone who can hear the garbage you Texans spew out of your pieholes every time you talk without smiling at this is braindead. Secede now you losers. Quit asking for compassion. You didn't show any when the Eastern seaboard was hit. So.....BURN BABY BURN!!!

Here's a little something for all of you spewing your venom towards fellow Americans  losing everything in the Texas fire. You think that because you use a phoney name and hide your profile, that you can't be found. On the contrary, it is relatively simple to find out everything about you. I wonder how your employer and maybe your pastor would feel if they knew about the crap you post? I do believe I will see what I can do to help you out.

LMFAO...How awesome is this? Texas is on fire and they are all on here looking for articles about Obama, so they can proclaim their hatred of black people. ^&*$ off Texans. I hope every inch of that sh-thole burns.

Wow! Some of you are just real jerks- Repububliturds and Dumbocrats alike, Here I am in Austin, an 'evacuee' from Bastrop and this is what America thinks. I am so grateful to at least realize that I could never be that insensitive to another persons extreme misfortune. Let me put it simply so the slow minds can understand. I could never have such nasty things to say about peoples losses and their homes on fire or at risk. It's a good thing we Texans look out for each other- it begins to be clear what the rest of America thinks. What has happened to this once great country is just a shame. I'm sick just thinking about it all, never mind the house I'm building ,being in between fire lines from several different fires and my pets stuck in the truck till it's safe to go home.

What the hell does Rick Perry have to do with over 1000 families losing their homes and everything they worked for?   This is NOT a political story.  This is a story about human suffering and tragedy and I'm horrified that this is the kind of response some so-called Americans can offer.   You know you only speak from your narrow brain and tiny heart of yours-- and not all Americans.   When you kick people  when hey are down and make fun of misfortune you can bet that karma will come and slap you upside your head.

Never in American history have we had a President that went out of his way to punish states that held a opposing political view. Past presidents at least took care of the American people...............This president is a disgrace!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Texas is a culturally diverse state, with many residents who've migrated here from other states and countries because Texas has jobs, low taxes, low housing costs, and some of the nicest people in the country. I was born and raised in Chicago, but Texas is my HOME! For you to say "God Hates Texas," or "Burn Baby Burn," and some of the other ignorant comments posted here, only makes me question your motives to do so -- and makes me thankful that you aren't a neighbor of mine!

As a Texan these comments further persuade me it may be time to defund FEMA. Not because people should not be helped when disasters strikes, but because it seems too tempting for politicians to use the program to buy friends and punish enemies. Texas has been on fire since April. We have lost 3.5 million acres and endured more than 5 billion in losses. I doubt the president, the media, or liberals would have ignored or celebrated these losses in a blue state.

Where is all of this hate coming from?  What do politics have to do with natural disasters?  People are dying, they are losing their homes.  Would you be just as hateful and disrespectful to the people who died on 9/11/01 in New York, Washington D.C., and Pennsylvania?  How is the suffering of Americans in Texas different from those who died 10 years ago?  Look deep into you soul, if you don't have compasion for your countrymen that are victoms of these fires, how can you consider yourself an American?

For all of you Perry bashers and anti-Texas fanatics.  Shame on you!  Whether you like Texans or not we are all humans and no one should have to endure this.  These people are losing everything they own and and many their livelihoods due to this devastating fire.  Not to mention the people who have actually been killed by these fires spreading throughout the state.  I don't recall all the bashing statements when the Mississippi was flooding the eastern plains nor when the latest hurricane flooded the east coast, so why should this be any different?

These scumbag union firefighters aint wort the money they earn. Mr. Perry is rite. Fire them all for being WAT TOO greedy. He should go after the know it all teachers, Useless police and way overpriced nurses next. 
We also need to cap wages here in the states at about $2.35 an hour for the first 8 hours and the next 4 hours should be for free so we to can compete against the global market

Texas has ALWAYS gotten FEDERAL money and grants.  Perry is a HUGE hypocrite as is any other Texan or Southener who decries Federal assistance when they are getting Federal assistance for something in their state(s) at the very same time they utter those hypocritcal words.   Perry should be eating several hats right now, because of his past rhetoric about not needing/REFUSING help from the FEDS when that has never been the case.

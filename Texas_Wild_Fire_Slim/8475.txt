Report: World Cup shortens Afghan deploymentAP – 13 hrs ago





WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Media reports say New Zealand troops serving in Afghanistan have been flown home weeks ahead of schedule because the defense force needs its aircraft for the Rugby World Cup.The Dominion-Post newspaper reported Thursday that the troops, among a contingent of 140 serving in Afghanistan's Bamiyan Province, ended their deployment early because of World Cup demands.A defense spokesman told the newspaper the rotation dates were moved because aircraft might be needed in the event of emergencies such as a natural disaster during the Rugby World Cup.

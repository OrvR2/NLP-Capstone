The video was accompanied by comments on the wildfires by Expedition 28 Flight Engineer Mike Fossum.

For some inconceivable reason, the national media only mentions﻿ the fires near Austin (the Bastrop complex) and Houston (Montgomery, Grimes, and Waller counties). But, northeast Texas has over 50,000 acres ablaze right now in Smith, Gregg, Cherokee, Anderson, Cass, Marion, Rusk, Henderson, Angelina, and Nacogdoches counties.

The Bastrop fire is actually the smaller plume on the bottom left. The large plume you see for most of the video is the Bear Creek fire in Cass/Marion county (northeast of Dallas,﻿ Texas). The river in view is NOT the Colorado, but the Red River. Just below this plume you can see a number of fires in Rusk and Angelina counties.

@harmageden If you think that﻿ human beings can cause floods, droughts, and earthquakes, you are purely a simple idiot. That is all that I have to say to you.

.... By the﻿ way , HAARP are quite capable of putting this fire out !
They have the ability to change weather patterns around the Earth . Instead of causing earthquakes , floods and droughts , you would think their would be at least one amongst ' them ' who had a heart , with an ounce of decency , to do something for the good of humanity .
I can't believe their isn't , let's pray their is .

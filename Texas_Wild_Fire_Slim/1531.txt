Has it been 15 years already? 
Latina magazine celebrates its 15th anniversary with a special collector’s issue, “15 Latinas We Love,” which highlights fifteen of the most influential Latina celebrities on its October 2011 cover since the magazine hit the stands 15 years ago.
In the 3-page fold out cover, from left to right: Shakira, Selena Gomez, Salma Hayek, Zoe Saldana, Eva Longoria, Gloria Estefan, Michelle Rodriguez, Jessica Alba, Daisy Fuentes, America Ferrera, Rosario Dawson, Ana de la Reguera, Natalie Morales, Rosie Perez and La La Anthony.
Latina’s 15th anniversary issue took 9 months of planning, 7 photo shoots, more than 100 red designer dresses and upwards of $10 million in jewelry to create the triple gatefold cover, which hits newsstands on September 13th.

A hour-long special, “Access Hollywood & Latina Magazine present 15 Latinas We Love,” will bring the cover to life.  Natalie Morales, news anchor & co-host of NBC’s Today show and Latina’s parenting columnist, will host the weekend edition of Access Hollywood. “15 Latinas We Love” airs next weekend on September 17th & 18th – check local listings for times.
Latina.com has dedicated a special section celebrating their 15th anniversary highlighting their cover stars throughout the years and 15 favorite Latina brides. There, fans can let Latina know what they think about the cover but it looks like fans and celebrities featured on the cover are already beating them to it on Twitter.

Popular musician Bayo Ade was killed by kidnappers in Benin City, Nigeria on Sunday, and the Daily Trust reports that "economic activities in and around Benin were disrupted for several hours." According to Nigerian publication Next, the city was in "pandemonium" as young people, "numbering over 1000," engaged in peaceful protest.
Ade's death came after the kidnappers collected 500,000 NGN (about $3300) from his family. As such, the motive behind the killing is unclear, although Edo State Commissioner of police, David Omojola, announced that two 19-year-old suspects are in custody. The Gross National Income per capita in Nigeria is $2070 annually, according to World Bank, World Development Indicators.
The killing came just a week after another high profile kidnapping of a businessman in the city, and and protesters were reported to have been demonstrating against the city's lax attitude toward crime.
In response to the unrest, Omojola announced that he would be tightening security throughout the state. 
Below, watch Ade's music video for "Amebo":

				For those wondering what is the meaning of the title of the song "Amebo" - it simply means a Gossiper or one who gossips. Now you know!

				I spent 10 yrs of my life in Benin City. Bayo Ade is not popular - he was.  This story is hucking forrible. There was absolutely no need to bring in the Nigerian GDP since it doesn't flow with the story and you don't point out that Benin (Edo State) is not doing so well right now.

				1000 protest against government in Nigeria makes news in the US.  But, 400,000 protest against government in Israel does not.  Yet they say it's free media in the US.

				A simple "has been covered here" doesn't change the point.  400,000 protesters in ANY country would typically grant a headline -- not a blurb.  Internatio­nal media such as RT and Aljazera do it right.  But, no US medium has come close -- not even HuffPost.  The point is, when media is for profit in an extreme capitalist­ic society, media is controlled by the Golden Rule.

				You need one more badge, friend! 
But, I don't know how to award it.  Sometimes they "pop up" for me;
other times not.  Just have my newly created {Informati­ve} badge!
And, faved.

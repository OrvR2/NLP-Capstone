Share your story: How have you changed since 9/11?By Lili Anne LadagaPostsBy Lili Anne Ladaga | The Newsroom – Fri, Aug 5, 2011

On September 11, 2001, terror attacks on New York, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania killed almost 3,000 people. On September 12, the survivors, the families of the victims, the first-responders woke up to find their lives irrevocably altered -- as did all Americans.
Ten years later, Yahoo! is asking: How have you changed since September 11?[Your Story: Tell us how you have changed]
Perhaps you lost someone close to you. Or the attacks compelled you to join the military or volunteer more of your time. Or, perhaps more simply, you hold your loved ones closer to you than ever before.
In honor of the victims, survivors and heroes of 9/11, the Yahoo! Contributor Network is asking readers to share their stories and memories of that day; tell us how 9/11 changed you. For every eligible submission we receive, Yahoo! will donate $10 to the 9/11 Memorial Fund, up to $10,000.
Your story will be featured alongside thousands of others on the Yahoo! News 9/11 anniversary site.

What really horrified me ws that a fellow employee brought information about Bin Laden to work before it happened. He was a Y2K nutjob so we all thought he was crazy. Well guess he was crazy like a fox because look what happened! He says we are in the end days and to be prepared. How do you prepare for the end days?

Wow, after reading most of these incomprehensible comments what I fear most is what is happening with our country! Who are all you idiots? Do you really live here in my country? If there is a failing of the US Government it is the fact that we now support idiots in the USA while also supporting the Kingdom of Saud, a non-democratic, male dominated, egoic oligarchy with a similarly based religion. So while you all drive around in your gasoline propelled cars and consume products mostly supported by an oil based economy, our government in turn supports those backward countries that have the oil! Gee, is this rocket science or what?

I had just stepped out of shower in the hotel I was in, in Houston, while on a business trip. Looking in disbelief at the TV keeping me company while away from home...the tower with the wide hole, an ignorant news reporter saying a small plane had hit the tower ( not with that wingspan honey...) the smoke curling up and my spine tingling down. Then, before i could fully digest that scene, an aircraft is shown hitting the second tower...was it a replay? No, it was a second aircraft hitting the second tower...we are under attack. The largest attack on US soil since Pearl Harbor. The world has changed...I gotta get home to the family...(another story)

It's amazing how 9/11 has changed all of our lives. I was in a small grocery store, reaching for a pound of butter when news of the attacks came on the television. I quickly checked out and rushed home, only to find that in all the confusion, I had inadvertantly grabbed a pound of "Parkay". As the tragedy unfolded I realized that Parkay really does taste like butter. Thanks to 9/11  I've switched to Parkay, and I'm so glad I did.

September 11,2001 was like a nightmare.it was a calamity least expected.I have always seen America as a model [and still is]. I knew security must have been compromised.Perhaps, we were all deep in sleep.Both the survivors and the dead I see as my relations.The whole thing changed my security perception.I find it difficult to trust anybody.And it was like a movie.The development shook me beyond imagination.Now i know better.Now i know that enemies are everywhere.It is quite sickening.it is still sickening.We need to brace up to the global security challenges.We need to go back to the religion foundation.I now know better that nowhere is safe...The world is in turmoil.

Maybe, just maybe, this could have been avoided if non-citizens were monitored closer, and sent home when they weren't here legally.  Failure by the government to do this will lead to more problems.

Respect for all government is now at a very low point.  It's difficult to listen to any of them and believe any thing they say.  Distrust amoung most of us is very high now.

9/11 brought home to me the realization that not just african americans, but yet OTHERS felt disenfranchised by white america. as a fort lauderdale firefighter i was NEVER made to feel welcome-the white firefighters went above and beyond to harrass and fire newly hired black & hispanic firefighters and their harrassment also encluded permanent black & hispanic firefighters as well. upon becoming dis-abled like several of my fellow white firefighters of whom had far lower disability ratings-i was told openly. "we did'nt build this for you ppl and as long as i'm on the fort lauderdale police & firefighters pension board, you will NEVER be approved." despite the current pension board administrator & attorney being present they both acted as though the statement was never made-upon requesting a copy of the taped transcript, I was tolded "it was accidently erased."  twenty years later, i'm still waiting to have my case addressed. not even my own government came to my aid-despite my being a former white house honor guard....

9/11 made me realize how our government is misrepresented in other countries. Like Iran's leader saying the holicost was fiction. I pray that our government does a better job internationally.

Arabs are like fish; people eat it and hate its smell. Without the Arab wealth America would never be built this way. Even though the hypocrites are helping our enemies kill our children; nothing will last for ever, because new superpowers are building up and the prophecy that scares the Zionists is about to be realized

As for you SashaGrey when Arabs are no more you will miss the free Colt 45 or Budweiser Arabs often give you whenever you claim that you forgot your wallet; however, when Muslims leave the planet, there will be a different story, because nothing prevents the wreath of Allah except His being merciful to Muslims!

Someone woke me up from a deep sleep to tell me the U.S. was being bombed, I jumped up and joined everyone in the living room to watch the news. I was very sleepy and watched in disbelief but I couldn't comprehend what I was watching. I avoid flying anywhere, when I do fly I have anxiety for weeks before the flight. I don't think about 9/11 when I'm feeling this anxiety but it did start after that day, so I am assuming the anxiety I feel has something to do with it. Would I ever try to do something if a flight I was on was sky-jacked? Yes I would probably die trying!

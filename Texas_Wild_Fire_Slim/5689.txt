Police: Teen loses legs as she tries to hop trainAP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011





LONGMONT, Colo. (AP) — A 17-year-old Colorado State University student lost both her legs when she tried to hop aboard a freight train and slipped underneath the moving train on Monday, police said.One of three males with the student was briefly dragged by the train but suffered only minor injuries. The accident occurred in the northern Colorado town of Longmont shortly after 1 p.m. when the group tried to board the northbound Burlington Northern Santa Fe train, police said.Train speed limits through Longmont are 25 mph. It wasn't known exactly how fast the train was going at the time of the accident.The student was taken to Longmont United Hospital by ambulance and then flown to Denver Health Medical Center. Denver Health officials said they couldn't release any information about her, but Longmont Police Cmdr. Jeff Satur said he believed she was conscious and able to talk.Longmont is about 30 miles north of Denver and about 30 miles south of Fort Collins, where the university is located. All four lived in Fort Collins and it's possible they caught a train south and were trying to return home when the accident took place, Satur said.No names have been released, but Satur said the three males with were between 17 to 20 years old. The female victim's parents live in another state, which Satur didn't identify.The male who was dragged by the train was cited for trespassing, as was another one of the males, Satur said. A third male made it aboard the train and his whereabouts were unknown.Satur said he didn't know if the female would be cited."She's got enough issues to worry about," he said.___Burlington Northern is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

she made a mistake that she'll have to suffer with forever. that sucks. reminds me of another story; a woman jaywalking with her child is hit by a car, and the child is killed. guess who got a ticket for jaywalking. i hope this girl doesn't get a fine for train-hopping. i know that innate consequences don't count in the eyes of the law, but i think sometimes they really should.

Make stupid decisions and live with the outcome! I don't feel a bit sorry for her, next time she should try using her idiotic brain!

in this litigious society that breeds irresponsibility, I won't be surprised if her parents try to sue the freight train owners for not posting enough warning signs. Hopefully they'll realize that they can't just file a lawsuit and run with it, because they won't have a leg to stand on. It's an unfortunate story, but clearly the responsibility (or lack thereof) falls in the young girl's lap.

Hey, they forgot to include that Casey Anthony was right around the corner and was able to stop the bleeding of the missing legs with her duct tape. Yahoo forgot to write in the article that she was listening to Van Halen's 1984 album and the song "Jump" when she took that ill-fated leap! All is well that ends well, right?

Wow!  I cannot believe what morons people are who leave comments on here.  First of all, she is a child.  She made a terrible mistake that SHE will be paying for for the rest of her life.  The last thing she deserves is to be cited for this and to be insulted by some irrelevant bloggers who probably have made terrible mistakes in their lives as well.  I pray something as horrific as this never happens to their loved ones even though they are such inconsiderate, hateful, judgmental a-holes.

17 is young for a college freshman.  Just getting out on their own, these kids will do some foolish and daring things while they learn to live as adults.  Unfortunately, some will die or be maimed passing through this age.  I wish they could have gotten through this with nothing worse then a broken leg.

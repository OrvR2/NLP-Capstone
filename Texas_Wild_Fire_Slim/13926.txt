Gov. Rick Perry, who was scheduled to be in Bastrop today to see and talk about the latest on the wildfires, didn’t show up.
His office had sent out two advisories about his media availability. The second one gave a new location for the event. 
But when the cameras started rolling, Perry wasn’t there. 
His staff said he was in Austin, stymied by the logistics of showing up after the location was changed. 
Reporter Hollie O’Connor was on the scene and talked to Perry staffer Allison Castle, who said, “Our intention was for him to be here. The location we had was not open yet, so we weren’t able to get all of you into that area, and so we were working with officials to find an alternate location, and I think you all got the change of plans as we were trying to solidify things, so again, due to logistical issues, we weren’t able to get him here. We didn’t want to hold y’all up.”
“We had all the local officials here and were able to provide the afternoon update with chief (Nimm) Kidd giving you up the update from the state.”
Castle didn’t say exactly why he couldn’t make it to the new location.
Perry just got back to Texas after a California campaign swing.

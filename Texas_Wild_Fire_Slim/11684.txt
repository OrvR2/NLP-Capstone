PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARISE FROM POOR HARVESTING OPERATIONS

Most landowners sell timber only once or twice in their lifetime and are unaware of problems that arise from poor harvesting operations. Getting the most money from the timber sale shouldn’t be the only objective.  Future productivity of the land and protection of streams, young timber stands and eroding soils should be equally important to the landowner.
Each year many forest landowners receive a large sum for their timber, but are angry about the condition of their property after the harvest and may face a major investment to reclaim it into productive, healthy forestland.
Often, a poor harvesting job will affect adjacent landowners as well.  Downed fences, opened gates, road damage and litter are the most common complaints of neighboring landowners when the harvesting operation is not carefully planned. Environmental complaints as well as civil court complaints may also be a result of a poorly planned timber sales.

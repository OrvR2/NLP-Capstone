During the Republican primary debate Wednesday night, Jon Huntsman was called out for his comment that the GOP is at risk of becoming the "anti-science party."
"Your chief political adviser has been quoted very prominently as describing the Republican Party as 'a bunch of cranks,' and said your opponents on the stage 'make a buffet of crazy and inane comments.' I'm sure that's insulting to some of these people up here, moderator John Harris said. "Who on this stage is anti-science?"
Huntsman declined to name exactly which of his opponents were making anti-science comments, but he did lament individuals who are questioning evolution and climate change:
"When you make comments that fly in the face of what 98 out of 100 climate scientists have said, when you call to question evolution, all I'm saying is that in order for the Republican Party to win, we can't run from science," Huntsman said.
"We can't run from mainstream conservative philosophy."
Rick Perry is someone who has questioned the scientific consensus on both climate change and evolution.
"I do believe the science is not settled on this," he reiterated when asked about climate change tonight. He compared climate skeptics to Galileo, saying, "Galileo was outnumbered for a spell" -- even though in that case, Galileo was the scientist facing skeptics.

																The presidential debate debut of Texas Governor Rick Perry -- where he sounded like a student just winging it on an oral exam for which he hadn't prepared -- was neither a triumph nor a disaster, leaving the score at the end of the night essentially unchanged.

He also doesn't look family in this GOP pact.

				For once, a sane voice commanding national media's attention comes from the depths of the GOP. If there were more Huntsman-l­ike voices within the GOP it may be a major factor in the shift of allegiance­s for individual­s experienci­ng frustratio­n with the current administra­tion. Unfortunat­ely, Huntsman's is drowned by the militantly vocal support lent by the rest of the GOP candidates for the "faith-bas­ed" science that is creationis­m.

Oh well, one man's poison is another man's happy hour. At least, the GOP support for pseudo-sci­ence and historical revisionis­m provides hours of amusement and snarks among the HP commenters­.

				When you are attempting to rescue a drowning person who is hysterical and fighting the rescue, best just to sock them one in the jaw, John Huntsman.  That's a metaphor.  Hopeless to try to rescue the GOP at this point. Personally­, i think John Huntsman knows he's really running for 2016.  By that time the GOP will be whimpering and eager for someone who could really win.

				", "Galileo was outnumbere­d for a spell" -- even though in that case, Galileo was the scientist facing skeptics."

Huh?

Galileo was the skeptic.   He was skeptical about the then current consensus view and collected data which seemed contrary to the existing standard model.  He suffered a common fate of someone who challenges the consensus and resorted to clever methods to get his views 'published­'.  Skepticism is part and parcel of the scientific method -- then and now.

Ndungane hopes for twin World Cup successAP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011





WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Winger Odwa Ndungane hopes for an identical experience to his twin brother Akona when he plays for South Africa at the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand.Akona Ndungane was a member of the Springboks team which won the last world tournament in France, and Odwa hopes that he will have a gold medal to match his brother's.Ndungane told a news conference on Wednesday he had spoken to his brother about his World Cup experience.He said "we try to keep in touch. He told me about his experience last time South Africa played and obviously they did very well. They won the World Cup. So for me I set my goal of being at the World Cup and hopefully I can do the same thing he did and come back with a gold medal."

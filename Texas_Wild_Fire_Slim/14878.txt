Author: TheAlyonaShow


The "Texas miracle" is a model for job creation and according to government figures Texas has gained more jobs in June and this year, than any other state in the country. But on the other hand, the state has one of the worst budget shortfalls in the country, a rate of unemployment that has been on the rise and a fiscally responsible government policy that included filling holes with federal bailout money. Patrick Gleason with Americans for Tax Reform weighs in.

Bastrop County Texas Seized by FEMA - Infowars Report

[Federal agencies seize control on Tuesday] Hundreds of firefighters from all the surrounding counties worked two days and nights in a heroic effort to contain the fires, but high winds Sunday night and all day Monday thwarted their efforts. So the call went out for more volunteer firefighters to join the effort from across the state. Before they arrived, however, the federal government showed up and claimed it was in charge of the situation. "Agents with the federal National Interagency Fire Center, a coalition of federal agencies including the US Forest Service, assumed command of firefighting efforts Tuesday afternoon," reports The Gonzales Cannon (www.gonzalescannon.com RealNewsReporter.com is now reporting that volunteer firefighters who had in some cases driven all night to reach Bastrop county were turned away by the feds, who claimed that since local officials never made a "formal request" for volunteers, the volunteers could not be "activated." So while Bastrop County burns from 40+ fires that are still raging, the federal government is actually telling volunteer firefighters to go home. "We were at the station getting set up into strike teams, and this guy came up and said that the US Forest Service had 'assumed control of the situation, and that If you don't have a vehicle that squirts water, go home,' said Gordon Greer of Kirbyville, in a RealNewsReporter article (www.realnewsreporter.com Gordon reportedly drove all night Monday to arrive in Bastrop and take <b>...</b>

Alex Jones Calls Texas Senators Cowards At Texas Capitol For Caving To Fed TSA Threats

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A bill that would prohibit federal agents from intrusive searches during airport security pat downs is likely dead in the Texas Senate after a threat from federal officials to close airports if the measure passed. The bill sponsor blamed Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst for turning senators against his bill Tuesday night. Republican Sen. Dan Patrick said he lost votes to bring the bill to the floor for a debate because Dewhurst caved to pressure from the federal government. The measure, already approved by the House, would make it illegal for anyone conducting searches to touch private parts under or through clothing. It also prohibits searches "that would be offensive to a reasonable person." Patrick said he doesn't have the support to bring the bill up again for a vote. Protestors gathered in the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon and angrily chanted at lawmakers after the bill was killed. Read more: www.myfoxaustin.com

house.gov CampaignForLiberty.com Much has been made recently about the supposed economic recovery. A few blips in a few statistics and many believe our troubles are all over. Of course, they have to redefine recovery as jobless to account for the lack of improvement on Main Street. But the banks have money, Wall Street is chugging along, and the administration would like to get on with other agendae. They have even set up a commission to investigate the crisis as if it were all in the past. The truth is that Americans are still losing jobs, the Fed is still inflating, and more regulations are in the works that will prevent jobs and productivity from coming back. We are on this trajectory for the long haul. The claim has been made many times that this administration has only had a year to clean up the mess of the last administration. I wish they would at least get started! Instead of reversing course, they are maintaining Bushs policies full speed ahead. They are even keeping the Bush-appointee in charge of the Federal Reserve! They are not even making token efforts at change in economic policy. And for all the talk of transparency, we hear that some powerful senators will do all they can to block a simple audit of the powerful and secretive Federal Reserve. We have been on a disastrous course for a long time. The money supply has doubled in the last year, our debt is unsustainable, the value of the dollar is going to continue its drop, and those Americans who understand <b>...</b>

Kurt Nimmo www.infowars.com www.prisonplanet.tv September 6, 2011 In an outrageous repeat of Katrina, the federal government has moved into wildfire-stricken Texas and turned away firefighting trained volunteers who had converged on Bastrop and Smithville to combat the out of control flames. According to The Gonzales Cannon, federal officials arrived at the scene and assumed command of the operation under the pretense "local officials never made a formal request for volunteers." Jennifer Jones, a spokesperson with the US National Interagency Incident Center, confirmed that a federal group comprised of several agencies would be assuming command in Bastrop County. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, FEMA refused to allow volunteer firefighters from around the nation, as well as trucks loaded with donated water, from entering New Orleans as troops, police, and mercenaries went house-to-house confiscating weapons. Officials in Louisiana accused FEMA of making the situation worse with red tape and a hesitant response immediately after Katrina blasted into the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, the Los Angeles Times reported on September 5, 2005. Alex Jones was contacted on Tuesday by firefighters who confirmed that FEMA is blocking volunteer assistance and has frustrated local attempts through the US Forest Service and its maze of bureaucratic red tape.

Ron Paul's Texas Straight Talk 4/18/11: Budget Cuts are Meaningless Without Fed Transparency

Order: Reorder
Duration: 4:45
Published: 2011-04-18
Author: minnesotachris


paul.house.gov http Congress focused on issues surrounding government spending this week as talk of deficits, the national debt, and the debt limit saturated the airwaves. This is a positive development. In years past, there was very little concern over how much was spent here in Washington, how it was spent, or how much of our gross domestic product was being consumed by government. That blissful ignorance naturally resulted in decades of government spending with impunity, bringing us to where we are today: trillions in debt with astronomical entitlement obligations that will be impossible to fulfill in the not too distant future. So it is a good thing that there is so much political pressure now on our leaders to actually put the brakes on runaway spending. However, even the most generous estimate of the spending cut passed this week -- $38.5 billion -- is a paltry 3.5% of the $1.05 trillion in spending through the next 5 months. This hardly makes a dent in our government's mountain of debt. Even worse than that, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) stripped away the accounting sleights of hand and scored it as only $352 million in cuts, which works out to less than half of one percent of spending. Still, the tiniest cut is better than the massive increases we have become accustomed to in federal budgets. Of course, our disastrous wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are not even included in this budget as they are considered emergency spending. They constitute <b>...</b>

Author: minnesotachris


house.gov CampaignForLiberty.com Last week I had the opportunity to bring up spending and transparency in two important hearings. On Wednesday I questioned Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on some highly questionable uses of funds at the Federal Reserve, and on Thursday I asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about exorbitant spending at the State Department. It is extremely important to continue bringing these issues up, especially in light of our difficult economic times, when so many are out of work, as I saw up close in my district at the Oceans of Opportunity Job Fair in Galveston two weeks ago. Those who are working live with the fear of losing their jobs as they struggle to pay bills. Meanwhile, Washington is talking of increasing their taxes, something voters were promised, clearly and adamantly, would not happen in this administration. Government also struggles with money, but the struggle centers on how to get more of your money into government coffers. Rather than expanding the Federal budget in the face of economic downturn, we should be focusing on eliminating waste and being the very best stewards of public funds that we can possibly be. Most businesses have had to streamline and cut back in order to survive, and so it is only fair for our government to do the same. Instead, the State Department is building a $1 billion embassy in London, the most expensive ever built. The plans even include surrounding it with a moat! I asked the Secretary of State <b>...</b>

Ron Paul on Fed Audit: Anything But Full Disclosure is Unacceptable! (Texas Straight Talk 10/26/09)

Order: Reorder
Duration: 3:29
Published: 2009-10-26
Author: minnesotachris


www.house.gov CampaignForLiberty.com Last week a new bill was introduced in the Senate to audit the Federal Reserve. Some backers of my bill HR1207 and the existing Senate companion bill S.604 were a little miffed at this, but depending on how you think about it, this new legislation poses no great threat to our efforts. With the economy in shambles, people are looking for answers - not just because of lost savings on Wall Street, but because of lost houses on Main Street. Because of the many problems we face, the Federal Reserve and its powers over the economy have come under scrutiny. This translates into a lot of political pressure on Congress. With all the House Republicans signed on as co-sponsors and over half of the Democrats, HR 1207 has enormous bipartisan support. It would be disingenuous for Washington not to embrace the principles behind this bill after all the promises for transparency. How can one credibly argue for more transparency in government in one breath and defend the secrecy of the Federal Reserve in the next? However, there is still very powerful resistance to the disclosures that HR 1207 would require and efforts to weaken it will continue to pop up before this issue is settled. The good news is that Washington is responding and the Federal Reserve has become the issue. Concerned Americans need to keep the pressure on by continuing to define what we want, and what we do not want. One major concern is that HR 1207 constitutes some kind of power <b>...</b>

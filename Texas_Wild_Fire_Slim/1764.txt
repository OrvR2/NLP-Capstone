The October issue of ELLE features not one, not two, but four covers with the "bodacious beauties" of Victoria's Secret: Doutzen Kroes, Adriana Lima, Miranda Kerr and Chanel Iman. 

The quartet of models sports a series of bright '80s-inspired ensembles in an array of heady hues, looking quite beachy for the fall issue (and making us nostalgic for summer already).
Editor-in-chief Robbie Myers notes, "These covers harken to what made ELLE ELLE: Shot outside, drenched in sunlight, color, and of course accessories, the women look right back at you with all the personal and sexual confidence in the world.”
Hey, we can't disagree. But we would like to know, how can the rest of us channel said confidence? 
Cover star Iman offers the following advice:
"Any woman who has a positive attitude about herself and carries herself with class but doesn’t try too hard and say, ya know, ‘Hey, look at me, I’m a bombshell,’ is basically a bombshell. It’s just a woman with a positive, strong attitude who knows she has it going on."
Oh, so that's the secret: all you have to do to become a bombshell is say you're a bombshell. Then poof -- Victoria's Secret will come calling! So much easier than we thought. 
For more interviews with the models -- and photos from the shoot --  head over to ELLE.com.

				If that is the "new" cannon of beauty, my brain and "heads" need to be re-formmat­ted! What's wrong with the "femminne" media? Besides, everything related to beauty and fashion is suggestive and sexualized­...Where are the feminists with all the blatant discrimina­tion and selective processes? I guess it's ok when it's amongst women...

encino.patch.com:
Shock waves reached the little school of Westmark in Encino last year when word came that a magnitude-7.0 earthquake had hit Haiti, killing an estimated 316,000 people, injuring another 300,000 and leaving 1 million people homeless.
Lauren Levine, a sixth- through eighth-grade reading and English teacher, and Dorothee Chadda, an English teacher and ninth-grade-level adviser, were chatting on the Internet two nights later.
“I said, ‘We need to do something,’ and [Levine] said she was thinking the same thing,” Chadda said on Tuesday, the first day Westmark students returned to school after summer break.

Dr. Jon LaPook: Dispatch From Haiti: "Controlled Chaos" of Cholera


		                        
																On Saturday afternoon we visited St. Nicolas Hospital in St. Marc, the current center of the cholera outbreak.  It was awful.                            

 






Bill Clinton: Giving Haiti a Chance: How You Can Help


							            							            In the midst of an awful tragedy, the Haitian people are reimagining a future that the Haitian government is committed to build. It won't be easy, it won't be quick, but it can be done. And we can help.							        



 






Jean-Max Bellerive: Vowing to Build a Prosperous Future for Haiti


							            							            The earthquake that has destroyed so much has also brought much-needed attention and goodwill to Haiti. In honor of all those who have died, we vow to create a new, stronger, and more prosperous Haiti.							        



 






Isabel Macdonald: Where's Haiti's Bailout?


							            							            Six months after the earthquake, the plan for a "New Future for Haiti" (a "Haitian-led" effort being funded under World Bank oversight, through a commission whose members include only seven Haitians) seems remote indeed.							        



 






Wyclef Jean: Time for the Warriors


							            							            I ask my brothers and sisters in Haiti to hold on. Together with a world of other good warriors, we will build a better Haiti.

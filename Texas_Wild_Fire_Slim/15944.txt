The other OlsenBy Leigh McEachranBloggerPostsBy Leigh McEachran | North Stars – Sun, 11 Sep, 2011 7:11 PM EDT


Seeing triple? No, twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen aren't actually triplets but they do have a younger sister, and her name is Elizabeth. The 22-year-old is giving acting a try, but don't compare her to her famous siblings- because she's doing things her own way.
The actress is the talk of the town this year at the Toronto International Film Festival, as she is promoting two flicks, the buzzed about "Martha Marcy May Marlene" and "Peace, Love, & Misunderstanding."
Hype for "Martha Marcy May Marlene" began at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, as the actress stunned critics with her performance as a woman who escapes a cult. The non-linear structure follows Olsen's character through her experiences and the paranoia that takes over once she leaves to live with her sister.
"You don't get an opportunity like this as an unknown actor. You don't get the opportunity to have such a range of things to go through in a character," Olsen told CTV.ca. "It's almost like making two films, this movie, and it's just a gift to be able to do something like that."
Olsen told Tribute.ca that she's wanted to be an actress her entire life. So why the hold up to make her film debut? "I just didn't want to be a child actor," she said. "I really enjoyed after-school activities."

The actress certainly would understand the sacrifices child actors make. Her sisters grew up in the spotlight, starting their careers at six months old on the TV show "Full House." They worked their way up to becoming a brand, with video series, TV shows, clothing lines, dolls - and more - on their resumes. With a workload like this, it's no wonder Elizabeth opted for a normal upbringing!
"Growing up, the press and the media to me were unfriendly people. So it's interesting to be in a place where it's not so unfriendly," said Elizabeth to MTV on how the press treats her better than her famous siblings.
"Everyone thinks they grew up with my sisters. People feel they're innately part of their business and personal lives, which they're not," said Elizabeth, addressing why the press is harder on the twins than her. "It's because there's a more intimate relationship and they can make opinions about everything. I didn't have that situation."
While the press is busy buzzing about "Martha Marcy May Marlene," it isn't the only film Olsen is promoting. The actress stars in "Peace, Love, & Misunderstanding" alongside Jane Fonda, Catherine Keener and "Gossip Girl" hunk Chace Crawford.

Olsen plays Zoe, who - along with her brother Jake (Nat Wolff) - is driven to Woodstock by her mom (Keener) to visit the family's hippy grandma (Fonda). The film screens Sept. 13 at Roy Thomson Hall.
But it isn't just her movies that are catching Hollywood's eye; Olsen's sense of style is setting her apart from MK and Ashley. The twins, who have become fashion icons with their high-end clothing lines, are known for their hipster-grunge look, but their lil' sis prefers a classic ensemble.
On Sept. 10, Elizabeth slipped on a tan Chloe skirt, Isabel Marant blouse and Jewelmint necklace for The Variety Studio At Holt Renfrew event. Definitely a more reserved ensemble than her sisters would've gone for!
And, for the Fox Searchlight party, she rocked a Carven dress, Jewelmint bag and — showing her sisterly love- a bag by the twins' line, The Row. (Fashion note: The twins named their line Elizabeth and James after their sister and brother.) Olsen followed this with a gorgeous floral gown at the "Martha Marcy May Marlene" premiere on Sept. 11 at Ryerson Theatre, which featured a splash of colour the twins — who normally gun for darker tones — might not have dared to wear.
As this Olsen takes over the acting biz for her famous sisters, it seems she may be one to watch on the red carpet as well!

Wow she is gorgous. So thats how the other to would look if they ate some food cause they are way to skinny. And after seeing the sis pic they would look so much better with some weight on. Damn they could be triplets eh. Good genes in those parents to have 3 gorgous gals.

She's smart enough to have learned from her sisters' misfortunes and kept herself out of the limelight until adulthood.

She also has a sense of style. Something her sisters only think they have, sadly a good part of the fashion world agrees.

I wish this young lady well. She seems to have her head screwed on properly so maybe her family will be connected with more than just a pair of washed up child stars struggling to keep their name in the news.

Wow, she's off to a good start with doing things her own way.. this one actually looks like she eats! That's so refreshing to see now-a-days, especially with the new "anorexic image" going around with celebrities.. She looks healthy and looks like she takes care of herself, good for her.. I just hope that doesn't change.

Libya probes China-Kadhafi arms dealBy Andrew Beatty | AFP – Sun, Sep 4, 2011

Libya's new government said Monday it was investigating documents that appear to detail secret Chinese efforts to sell a vast quantity of weapons to Moamer Kadhafi's regime despite UN sanctions.
The papers disclosed by Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper purport to show how state-controlled Chinese arms firms tried to sell weapons and ammunition worth at least $200 million (141 million euros) to Kadhafi in late July, in the thick of Libya's civil war.
The texts were discovered in a pile of rubbish sitting at the kerb in a neighbourhood known as Bab Akkarah, where several of Kadhafi?s most loyal supporters had homes, the Globe and Mail said.
The papers do not confirm whether the arms -- including rocket launchers and anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles -- were delivered, but the revelation has sparked anger and unease in Tripoli.
"It is very possible that these documents are authentic," National Transitional Council military spokesman Abdulrahman Busin told AFP, adding that legal advice is being sought as the matter is investigated further.
"We are examining all the evidence, we have a team of lawyers who are also examining the issue, and based on what they find they shall be taking it from there," Busin said.
Earlier the Globe and Mail reported that Omar Hariri, chief of the NTC's military committee, reviewed the documents and concluded they explained the presence of new weapons on the battlefield.
"I'm almost certain that these guns arrived and were used against our people," Hariri told the paper.
Beijing denied the allegations, but said Libyan officials had visited China in July for talks with "interested companies."
"In July the Kadhafi government sent someone to China without the knowledge of the Chinese government to make contact with the representatives of interested companies," foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told journalists.
"Chinese companies have not provided military products to Libya in any direct or indirect form. Chinese companies did not sign arm sales contracts and they did not export military products to Libya."
But the allegations threaten to further strain already testy relations between the new Libya and Beijing.
For much of Libya's crisis China had refused to fully recognize the now-ruling NTC and opposed NATO's mission in support of it.
"Those involved are trying to prolong the suffering of the Libyan people," said NTC spokesman Jalal El-Galal.
The papers appear to show that Kadhafi?s top security aides made a trip to Beijing in mid-July, where they met with officials from China North Industries Corp. (Norinco), the China National Precision Machinery Import & Export Corp. (CPMIC), and China XinXing Import & Export Corp.
The Chinese companies offered the entire contents of their stockpiles for sale, and promised to manufacture more supplies if necessary.
The companies also noted that many of the items the Libyan team requested were already held in the arsenals of the Algerian military and could be transported immediately across the border.
South Africa was also mentioned as a possible intermediary.
Appendices stapled to the main memo show that the parties discussed truck-mounted rocket launchers, fuel-air explosive missiles and anti-tank missiles, among others items, the report said.
The Chinese apparently also offered offered Kadhafi?s men the QW-18, a surface-to-air missile which is roughly similar to a US Stinger and is capable of bringing down military aircraft.
According to the papers the hosts thanked the Libyans for their discretion, emphasized the need for confidentiality, and recommended delivery via third parties.
Libya's new leaders have long accused Algeria of supporting the Kadhafi regime with military hardware, but the prospect that South Africa may also have been used to ship arms has come as a surprise to some.
South Africa has also been reluctant to recognise the NTC and has opposed NATO's mission.

China will do nothing. There is a reason they havent tried to take back Taiwan. China cant even feed half its population. Chinas economy is catching up with the US because the US economy is the worst its been in decades. China will never have the Navy and Airforce that the US has even if they become the biggest economy. The US will always make sure it rules the sky and the sea at any cost. The US has to much of an influence around the world for China to handle. China knows this. Throughout history the two biggest powers have never really liked each other. All this posturing is nothing.

War with China in the future is inevitable. China and its few allies will fall to the US and its many allies. Its gonna happen. Then we can give China to Taiwan.

The Tea party wants to make deep cuts to Medicare and SS, balance the budget, and keep tax breaks to the rich. 
The Republican Party says they want a balanced budget and tax breaks but know if they make deep cuts to SS and Medicare, they will be voted out. They prefer to sacrifice a balanced budget to maintain their power and help the rich; then use Democrats as a budget spending scapegoat.
 Democrats want to cut spending without sacrificing the elderly, get rid of tax loopholes for the rich, and balance the budget.
 Tell me? If Republican’s or Tea party candidates take over all three branches of government, who are they going to blame the cuts to SS and Medicare on?
 You have one term “at best” before America turns on the rich to save grandma.
 Good luck!

@ Proudchinese Wong
You have every right to be proud to be a Chinese.  However there are a lot of sad chapters in Chinese history.  If you actually learned from them, that would be commendable.  But China and Russia always choose the evil side of every conflict.

What if we didn't allow any products made in China to inter the USA?  The companies that ship work over there would be stuck with all their junk in China and wouldn't get rich off their poorly made products!  If they make their wepons as shoddy as the garments that get sold over here, we don't need to worry about them!  They would blow up in their faces!

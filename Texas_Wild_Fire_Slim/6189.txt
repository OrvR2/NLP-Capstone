During Wednesday night's Republican presidential debate, former Utah governor Jon Huntsman suggested it's time the country bring the remaining United States troops stationed in Afghanistan home. 
"I think we've lost our confidence as a country," he explained. "I think we have had our innocence shattered. I think, ten years later, we look at the situation and we say, we have 100,000 troops in Afghanistan. This is not about nation-building in Afghanistan. This is about nation-building at home."
The GOP presidential contender continued, "Our core is broken. We are weak. We have got to strengthen ourselves. I say we've got to bring those troops home."
The remarks from Huntsman came in response to a question on whether he believes the country is safer today as a result of the nation's counter-terrorism efforts in a post-9/11 era. Looking ahead to the ten year anniversary of the tragic day he said, "I think one way to commemorate our ten-year anniversary of 9/11, remembering the 3,000-plus people who died in New York and in Pennsylvania and in Washington, is to say it's time for this country to set a goal for ourselves: We're going to get our core fixed. We're going to do some nation-building right here at home."
It's not the first time the former governor has raised doubt over the country's ongoing military presence in Afghanistan. HuffPost's Amanda Terkel reported on what the Republican hopeful had to say on the issue during an interview that aired on ABC's "Good Morning America" in May:
On Afghanistan, Huntsman did not specify an exact withdrawal date, although he expressed skepticism that having 100,000 U.S. troops on the ground there was the best decision.

"I would tell you that we have to evaluate very carefully our presence in Afghanistan," he said. "And my inclination would be to say that it is a heavy and very expensive presence we have on the ground. That at a point in time where we need to be looking at our asymmetrical threats, what we have in Afghanistan today is not consistent with how we ought to be responding."
The comments are similar to ones the former Utah governor made in New Hampshire on Thursday, when he called a drawdown of U.S. troops "inevitable."
During an appearance on CNN's "State of the Union" earlier this summer, Huntsman questioned President Barack Obama's timeline for withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan and said, "My hunch is the American people want to be out of there as quickly as we can get it done."
Below, full video of Wednesday's debate hosted by NBC News and Politico.

				I may have to start calling myself an independen­t instead of a Democrat, because if Huntsman wins his party's nomination­, I'm voting for him next November. His views are moderate and reasonable­. So are President Obama's, but I expect the Republican­s on the Hill will actually work with Huntsman, and of course the Democrats on the Hill will work with anyone.

				Dear Huntsman. It was Bush who put them there. Bush and his army physically destroyed Afghanista­n and installed a hopelessly corrupt government­. Do not we owe the people of Afghanista­n something to combat this and rebuild? If a person destroys his neighbor's house,  he/she has to pay damages. We have to pay damages. Hopefully, these will be in the form of schools, hospitals, food security, housing, and rights for women. If we leave now, all is lost for the people of Afghanista­n. Sorry, but this is the way it is.

				Huntsman may be the first to emulate what Ron Paul says about foreign "nation-bu­ilding", but Ronny still said it first - and best.

http://www­.youtube.c­om/watch?v­=GrHm4phj5­RQ

Ron Paul, sadly, predicted our results. By 2013 we will still be there...mo­st likely longer. "How many men/women have to be lost? How many dollars have to be wasted?"

				the only reason he was offered a job by bho is that some advisor was smart enough to recognize him as a threat to the democratic powers that be.  Unfortunat­ely the republican wing of the uniparty probably isn't smart enough to realize he is one of the few who could beat bho .

				Huntsmann is by far the most intelligen­t of the Republicun­ning candidates­, but no, even he cannot beat Obama. Especially since the "party faithful" in the GOP will never allow him to win the nomination­.

He also added that there are people who are indeed planning to launch some terrorist attacks. On the other hand, there are also people who have been supporting the plans of some terrorists abroad.Threats To Australia’s SecurityAssistant Commissioner Lancaster was interviewed by Herald Sun as the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks approaches.  Steve Lancaster said that the police officers have been discreetly thwarting several attempts of terrorists in Australia.  But, what remained as the biggest threat to the safety of Australians are these religious extremists who believed that Islam advocates terrorism.Jihadist Message Inspiring TerroristsJemaah Islamiyah and al-Qaida are known to be the biggest threats to the safety and security of Australia. However, reports also revealed that many Australians have been subscribing to the jihadist message authored by some Muslim extremists. The existence and activities of the terrorists in Australia will continue as they are being inspired by a message from Al Qaida.  Steve Lancaster believes that Australia has become one of the targets of terrorists today.   He went on to say that thwarting any terrorist attack at an early stage is now more important than prosecuting successfully those terrorists.Lessons Learned From Past MistakesSteve Lancaster also mentioned about the mistakes they did way back year 2007.  This was when they falsely accused Dr Mohamed Haneef in 2007 of being involved in terrorist attacks. From that experience Mr. Lancaster said they learned many lessons and because of it, they have become a stronger and better force.”I can tell you the Haneef affair hurt the organization. It had an enormous impact on morale within the organization,” he said. Mr. Lancaster also continued to say that their response to terrorism now continues to improve since the September 11 attack.In this article you learned that Transport hubs, sporting venues and other crowded areas are the favorite places of terrorists.  This information is according to the intelligence update reported by the Herald Sun.

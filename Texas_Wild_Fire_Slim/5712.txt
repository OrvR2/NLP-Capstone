LISBON, Portugal -- Syrian President Bashar Assad should back away from his violent crackdown on protesters and enter talks with the opposition, Iran's leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Wednesday.
"There should be talks" between the Syrian government and its opponents, Ahmadinejad said in a live interview in Tehran with Portuguese broadcaster Radiotelevisao Portuguesa.
"A military solution is never the right solution," Ahmadinejad said, according to a simultaneous Portuguese translation of his comments.
"We believe that freedom and justice and respect for others are the rights of all nations. All governments have to recognize these rights," he said. "Problems have to be dealt with through dialogue."
Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said last month that Assad should answer the legitimate demands of his people.
"Other countries in the region can help the Syrian government and people to talk to each other with a view to resolving their differences and introducing the reforms that are needed," Ahmadinejad said.
Iran, Damascus' chief ally, has blamed the U.S. and Israel for instigating more than five months of protests in Syria.
The U.S. and other nations have accused Iran of helping Assad crush the uprising.
"Other countries have no right to interfere in ... domestic discussions," Ahmadinejad said, citing NATO's intervention in Libya as an example of misguided actions.

				Ahmadineja­d singing kumbya to al Assad?  What a hoot.  Iran knows which side the felafel is buttered on.  It's called the "spoils of war" and Iran is going to get it's share not matter which side wins (my money's on the Protesters­).  Iran is already heavily invested in Syria, this move just up's the anti.

				I agree, Syria should adopt the US model, go in with guns blazing, shock and awe the s..t out of them.  Or, maybe we should grow up and use this thin sliver of an opening from Iran and work together to stabilize a region that George Bush totally destabiliz­ed with his attack against an innocent nation.  We could also go into Iran and lump around looking for WMDs, how did that work out for us?

				Ahmadineja­d has stated several points that I've been suggesting for the past seven months: "The unrest in Syria and Libya, unlike that in Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Bahrain, Jordan and Yemen was instigated by the U.S., Britain and France. WHile I'm uncertain of how the Syrian educationa­l system functions I'd say that if it resembles that of the western government­s - "Dumbing Down, or financiall­y limiting" your citizens is not in the nations overall interest.

There's no question -- Americans are the coolest. That's according to a new poll, which ranked nationalities by how 'cool' they are perceived to be. 
The social networking site company Badoo.com surveyed 30,000 people over 15 countries to find out which nationalities were considered 'cool.' Americans came in as the coolest nationality in the world.
Among the findings -- Spanish are considered the coolest Europeans, while Brazilians are ranked the coolest Latin Americans. 
What were the most uncool nationalities? Read the whole Reuters article to find out. 
CORRECTION: A previous version of this post misstated that the Badoo.com survey profiled 30,000 people over five countries.

				Someone on topic, I guess.  Earlier said Americas are rude and loud when they are abroad.  

Ten minutes ago received a call from my director - the lady who works hard and long so I can waste time on HP.  She's currently on a month's vacation in the US, and after a week in St Paul is heading to Chicago.  Couldn't half understand her because she was so excited.  

One of her comments was interestin­g in view of this discussion­.  She said she was impressed with the kindness and manners of Americans; that she was treated well, no one making fun of her accent.  She said this suprised her in view of the Americans she has come into contact with in Moldova.

				Nothing surprising in this. No doubt you have heard of "The Ugly American", who travels the world spreading boorishnes­s and disrespect everywhere he goes. Well, I am an American living abroad, and when I encounter other Americans abroad while traveling, I often find myself wincing at the ignorance and antics I observe. They should be grateful that so many people in other countries work hard to communicat­e in English, not be critical or derisive of the other person's efforts to do so. And seeing the cultural treasures of another country should not always elicit a statement that "Well, we have bigger/bet­ter at home". 

On the other hand, when at home, Americans tend to be friendly and accepting. They want the visitor to think that America has the biggest/be­st of whatever. Of course, I cannot quite experience that in the same way a visitor does -- after all, I am one.

				If you think about it this is a no-brainer­. America provides the world its internet social networks, the top film stars, tech gadgets, comics, musicians, culture, etc. America is cool and like every country of this size it has its downside and ugliness too. 

Sorry to see that our Canadian brothers to the north rated as the 4th least coolest, though. Every Canadian I've known has been pretty cool. Also, I'm surprised to see Mexicans rated as the 8th coolest. Therefore, it appears a lot of Americans want to build border fences to keep out the cool Mexicans, but have no problem with those uncool Canadians coming over. Food for thought.

				Schauer, Frederick (February 2005). "The Exceptiona­l First Amendment"­. Working Paper Series from Harvard University­, John F. Kennedy School of Government­. doi:10.213­9/ssrn.668­543. "On this cluster of interrelat­ed topics, there appears to be a strong internatio­nal consensus that the principles of freedom of expression are either overridden or irrelevant when what is being expressed is racial, ethnic, or religious hatred. ... In contrast to this internatio­nal consensus that various forms of hate speech need to be prohibited by law and that such prohibitio­n creates no or few free speech issues, the United States remains steadfastl­y committed to the opposite view. ... In much of the developed world, one uses racial epithets at one's legal peril, one displays Nazi regalia and the other trappings of ethnic hatred at significan­t legal risk and one urges discrimina­tion against religious minorities under threat of fine or imprisonme­nt, but in the United States, all such speech remains constituti­onally protected.­".

				Perhaps the point focuses on "constitut­ional". Much of the world has "right to free speech" and much of the world does not have a written constituti­on in which that right is spelled out. Where I live we have free speech, but no constituti­on, and I shudder to think sometimes that an act of the legislatur­e could overthrow that right. But, I don't expect that to happen.

       Sunday Sept. 11, 2011 UTC 17:36 Ten years ago the world was stunned by the outrageous act of terrorism enacted against the USA. The unthinkable came to pass with highjacked passenger planes flown into symbols of American might, both military and monetary. Nearly 3 000 people were killed that day. People of all creeds, ages and religions were killed. Tragically the heroes in this sad business, the first responders, are still dying. On 9/11 New York lost 300 fire fighters who rushed to the terrible scene. When the twin towers collapsed spewing dust over the city, the emergency workers were front and center helping the survivors and continuing their rescue work. How has America thanked those that are slowly dying? First responders and construction workers on site, dismantling the wreckage and locating the dead worked with little protection. The need for them was too great and the possibility of finding someone alive in the tangled mess was too urgent a need to wear breathers. Besides the authorities assured the workers that while the air was dusty, it was safe. We know differently now. The air was filled with a toxic brew of cement dust, asbestos and vaporized metals. Many of these formerly healthy and fit workers are now suffering from ailments that forced them to quit their work. Some have lost their houses and cannot afford the medications needed to keep them alive. Various forms of rare cancers are killing the workers. How did the grateful public reward those who risked their lives to rescue others? They refused to pay medical expenses for those who fell ill from their acts of selflessness. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act took nearly ten years to become law. The law, excludes medical care for those who were Ground Zero responders who are suffering from cancer. The law will expire in five years. Perhaps by then all the heroes of this disaster will have died and the grateful public can continue their memorial services at Ground Zero untroubled by sick and disillusioned heros. It is a timely opportunity for citizens of the USA to reflect on how their heroes are really treated once the emergency is over.        1 of 5              the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation passes nearly to years later, but excludes health care for cancers.

I would add that it is time for Americans to start thinking about caring for their fellow citizens, even if they didn't sacrifice their lives for people they did not know. Remember, many had, before 9/11. It is like since Sept. 11 everything changed. I know many journalists involved in covering the event, and I have covered things like it. Such an event doesn't have to be spectacular to qualify. After it happened I wondered what had happened to the editors I worked for. I believe Bush's advisers told him journalists would be so traumatized they could be manipulated. They are not immune from PTSD. And Bush and his Halliburton sidekick were successful. In this atmosphere there was no way we could react intelligently. And we certainly would not even attempt to try to find out why these terrorists had targeted us like this. These kind of people are likely to kill someone but why us?

rated up, good comment on how dispensable the doers the carers and even the military are to the administration. So therefore in that light, perhaps the question can be considered if the victims of 9/11 were also dispensable to *their agenda* there are many holes in the *official version* of what happened on that fateful day. The world has changed since that day as RW pointed out, it is not a safer place whatsoever there are many more conflicts around the world and the american military machine just keeps on rolling along !

I believe there are many truths from 9/11 we will never know. It has been almost 50 years and many still don't believe what was written about JFK so if many think the government would mastermind a cover up of that who is to say they didn't wave the magic bullet wand again. Well written B keep it up.

Bmc Pherson, amazing and fantastic reporting, september 11 is a trauma for all creeds all over the world, I am a muslim,liberal muslim, i finished al-quran (khatam) al-quran at the aged of 11,i studied at the english school, Sultan Ismail College 1979, taking Malaysian Certified Education,MCE, 1988 graduated, with Diploma in Journalisme.In the field of malaysia media,for almost 20 years, what was doing (as reported by US media "terrorsit brutal act but was denied by muslims) if it's true,it is totally wrong-Islam never taught-their followers to kill and killing innocent people even during the war, i thinks"the act was a deviation of Islamic teaching, May the "victims" rest in peace, Rated up

While billions are being spent on a new tower and memorials a few million cannot be spared to improve the health of those first responders who suffered health problems because they carried out their duties faithfully.

Mets’ plans to wear first responder caps thwarted by MLBBy Yahoo! News | The Upshot – 10 hrs ago

MetsNYPDBy 'duk
The New York Mets wanted to make a powerful statement during Sunday night's game by wearing the hats of the agencies that sent first responders into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.
Major League Baseball, however, said no.
In a decision that's already drawing plenty of criticism — and rightfully so — league officials said the Mets could not wear hats with 'FDNY' and 'NYPD' printed on them during the nationally-televised game against the Chicago Cubs.
The move would have been a nod to the last month of Sept. 2001, when the Mets wore similar caps given to them by firemen and police officials at Ground Zero — and by some of the families of those who perished on Sept. 11.
MLB, however, couldn't — or rather, wouldn't — budge from its original edict that all teams wear hats with a small and simple flag embroidered on the side. When the Mets made a move to continue wearing the hats after pregame ceremonies, they were told that the team would be hit with a heavy fine.
From the Associated Press:
Joe Torre, MLB's executive vice president for baseball operations, told The Associated Press the decision was made to keep policy consistent throughout baseball and that "certainly, it's not a lack of respect." ... MLB issued a league-wide memo on uniforms for games played on the 10th anniversary, saying teams must wear their everyday caps with a small flag on the side.
The league originally told the 2001 Mets that they could not wear the hats during the games, either, but as former Met Todd Zeile remembered for reporters on Sunday, "it was really a collective feeling from everybody in the clubhouse that ... we're going to wear these hats until we can't wear them anymore, until they're ripped off our heads.'"
So why would MLB make such a decision when even the usually-draconian NFL relaxed its rules when it came to uniform tributes on the 10th anniversary of 9/11?
ESPN's Buster Olney reported that MLB felt the hats were "sacrosanct," which may explain why Torre — who was as close to 9/11 as any other sports figure and should be able to recognize the tribute — said what he did. I also got the sense that baseball was looking to be as respectful as they could this weekend and not appear that they were trying to put a commercial spin on the tragic milestone.
This ruling, however, just doesn't make sense. The first responders and their families did not raise any issues when the Mets wore the caps in 2001 and wearing them on 2011 would have been a nice way to bookend what was a very memorable part of baseball's role in the Sept. 11 healing process.
Also, if MLB was worried about keeping control of the uniform tributes, they could have ruled that only the two New York teams and the Washington Nationals had the choice to wear organization-specific caps.
But in nixing the Mets' plans to honor our courageous and our brave, baseball prevented the Mets, their fans and the city of New York from paying the highest form of tribute to those brave men and women while re-enacting one of the sport's most admirable moments. Joe Torre and his crew should have known better.

Congratulations to MLB for a solid performance in winning the "Grinch Who Stole Christmas" award! The powers that be in MLB could not have chosen a better time to act like complete idiots! There was absolutely nothing "commercial" about what the Mets were trying to do. It was a beautiful gesture to honor those true heroes of 9/11 who gave up their lives to serve their city and nation. 
  MLB owes apologies to the Mets AND the nation!!

No one said they couldn't wear the hats. They were told they would be fined if they did. If you wish to make a statement in life then make it, take a stand, and worry about the consequences later. At most there would have been a fine involved which after criticism would have been minimalized.if it doesnt matter enough for you to take stand then maybe it didn't mean enough to you to bring up the argument in the first place.

Maybe you wanna ch'eck it out or tell your friends.
Good for MLB! Finally - someone in America who is not terrorized and bullied into some mock display of grief and commercialization of 9-11. Maybe we DO have the freedom not to quake under the media exploitation of a tragedy.

If MLB could have found profit in it you can bet the caps would have been allowed.  Look at those stupid retro uniforms and caps worn from time to time.  Sadly, money drives sports and the spectator supports it by buying the crap thrown at him.

My best friend ,she just has announced her wedding with a millionaire man! They met via SearchⱤichṢingles.CȯṀ ..it is the largest and best club for millionaires and their admirers to chat online. …You do not have to be rich or famous, but you may meet one. It's worth a try!

Pretty creative move but won't last long. The competition will just come up with ways to make it ineffective. Enjoy it while it works!

Just lost all respect for Joe Torre and the rest of MLB Operations. Thank you NY Mets for "trying" to do the right thing......NY Mayor didn't want first responders in the 9/11 ceremonies and Joe didn't want the first responders ( NYPD - FDNY ) on the players hats. Soooooooooo Mr. Mayor and Joe  ~  kiss my red white and blue American ass  !

Joe Torre had NOTHING to do with this decision; that edict was passed down from the top Jew.  Torre was just the puppet carrying the water for te Jews.

All the Jew-run pro leagues are obviously anti-American but the mindless drones of our nation MUST have their fix and if that means allowing the dictatorships of pro-sports run by Jews to disrespect our nation, so what, "I need to watch my game" means much more to the simpletons of this nation than honoring those who were mindlessly murdered by another warped deviant religion.  I have more respect for the players who told the leagues to stuff it, fine me and screw! but I AM WEARING WHAT I WANT TO HONOR THOSE WHO DIED!  

Boycott pro sports and things change. Write their offices today and let them know how outraged you as an American are at their lack of respect to the nation that provides their wealth.

Want lower ticket prices?  Don't go to the games.  They'll lower them, I've seen it happen!

Want lower concessions?  Don't buy the over-priced,   preservative-laced garbage hey peddle as food and beverages when you attend.

Don't want to pay outrageous prices for garbage apparel made in a 3rd world country.  Don't buy it!  You can get knock-offs from China that look the same and cost a fraction of the price but not a dime will go to MLB, NFL, NBA or NHL.  Who cares if it undermines their leagues; they don't seem to care about undermining and disrespecting our nation!

The majority of people in this country just bitch and moan but NEVER EVER take action.  We saw the ones that do at Ground Zero on 9-11-01 and the days, weeks and months after.  We've seen them when tornados and floods devastated the Midwest and we see them in Texas help victims of hellacious wild fires.  Thank God for them or we'd still be digging through the rubble at Ground Zero.  So Torre and MLB are right, why buck policy to honor those cretins!

We surely are reaping what we have sown!!  We have become a spineless nation of idiots led around by corporations telling us what to eat, drive, wear,etc and politicians dedicated to bilking every penny they can until we end up having to pay them to work and then they will decide where we work, where we live, what we drive, what we eat, what we can say.  Do I need to continue??  

And people wonder why Jews have had a target on them for thousands of years, why people HATE corporations and politicians.  Not all of us are mindless morons drinking their Kool-Aid and have a clear perspective of history to see how in time this keeps happening due to society's willingness to sacrifice rights and freedom for "fairness and security" when in the end you really have NOTHING!!!  People like me are here to remind you how history keeps repeating itself because like a frog in a pan slowly brought to a boil will allow themselves to boil to death because they are too stupid to realize the water is slowly being brought to a boil.  
Well the American people are the frog and corporations and politicians are the pan of water slowly being brought to boil.  JUMP STUPID JUMP!!!!!!!

And you wonder why just about every baseball stadium is empty with no fans, tv ratings are way down, a stupid all star game rule, winner gets home field advantage when most of the top stars don't even play or show up for the all star game. Thank goodness football has started. I have not watched one baseball game this year and never will again. I always get tickets to the Braves games and I can't give them away so I throw them in the trash.

Why we need tax havensBy Richard Murphy | Forbes – Mon, Sep 5, 2011





I note that Dan Mitchell of the Cato Institute and other such organizations has written a post here on Forbes arguing that tax havens are a force for good.
Well now I should declare I know Dan. We've even had a beer or two together in our time. In that case I'd hate to spoil his party. So let me add to his list of reasons why we need tax havens because, I have to acknowledge that it's clear that without them we couldn’t:
- undertake mass tax evasion
- hide multinational company profits from tax
- launder drug money
- launch attacks on the tax systems of democracies
- undermine small local business by providing a competitive advantage to multinational corporations
- ensure counterfeiters have a secure base from which to trade
- provide every kick-back deal with a place to hide the evidence
- facilitate insider dealing
- help kleptocrats loot their countries
- hide the trail of people traffickers

- provide asymmetric information to markets that increase risk and threaten global financial collapse
- shift wealth from the poor to the rich.
So sure, since all these things obviously add to the stock of human wellbeing I have to agree with Dan, it's absolutely obvious that tax havens really are a force for good.
And I defy anyone to disagree!
PS I just wish Dan would get his terminology right though. The places he refers to really aren't tax havens. They're secrecy jurisdictions.
Secrecy jurisdictions are places that intentionally create regulation for the primary benefit and use of those not resident in their geographical domain. That regulation is designed to undermine the legislation or regulation of another jurisdiction. To facilitate its use secrecy jurisdictions also create a deliberate, legally backed veil of secrecy that ensures that those from outside the jurisdiction making use of its regulation cannot be identified to be doing so.
Again, as I'm sure Dan agrees - that's obviously something that adds to the sum of human well-being.

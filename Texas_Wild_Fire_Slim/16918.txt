Lions surge late to win hoops Battle of 287, 78-66
Waxahachie made another run against Lion basketball on Friday night, but this time Ennis had the last laugh.

On Friday in Waxahachie, the [...]

Let’s reconnect the broken ties
In the newspaper business, there’s nothing better than the end of January. Sure I still have to deal with closing out the month and finalizing our financial statement, but the end of the dreariest month for retailers is exciting for me. Our customers aren’t hanging their heads wondering why nobody’s shopping when its 10 degrees [...]

TxDOT, take a look at U.S. 287 near the airport
Friday’s heavy downpour and subsequent wreck on U.S. 287 drew attention to the possibility that stretch of roadway could use a good, solid appraisal. Road conditions have always been a point of public debate and pride when they are positive. Texas’ reputation in previous years for having some of the best-kept roads in the country [...]

Although administrators aren’t sure what the test will look like, they do know it will include end-of-course exams in each of the core subjects for high [...]

Spotlight on … Youth minister Mark Robbins
Mark Robbins, 27, heard God’s call when he was 15. &#34;It wasn’t like a big, tingling feeling. It was more serious than that, it was God working on my heart,&#34; Robbins said. Robbins has pursued his calling ever since. &#34;Since I’ve been called, God has continued to open doors for me, and they are often [...]

8th Maroon Lions shine in clutch vs. Everman
here were plenty of reasons for the eighth grade Maroon Lions to feel like a win was out of reach on Thursday night, but coach Quinton Brown and his players were highly motivated to overcome the odds. Ennis (4-3) was without the services of leading scorer Shawn Johnson and top rebounder Terrance Williams. Then there [...]

Haiti relief a sign of our charity
To see the people of a community come together to help their fellow residents is touching, but to see them come together to help the citizens of a country over 1,000 miles away is much more astounding. If you have been paying attention to world news, you probably know that the earthquake that devastated Haiti [...]

Caring for each other makes  us stronger
It warms the heart to think about the ways Ennis has gathered around itself to share with friends and family as a community. The Wednesday Night Live program at First United Methodist Church is one of those ways, one that gained our attention recently — a diamond of togetherness in the rough of isolating activities [...]

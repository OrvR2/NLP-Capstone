 San Francisco News






By Shyla Batliwalla
The only thing San Franciscans hate more than litter and chain restaurants is a bragging New Yorker. While it's not that we don't appreciate all that is New York, our little metropolis is equally (if not even more) awesome. Of all the things New York we love to hate, the one thing New York we do actually love to love is the Manhattan cocktail. It's a flawless sweet, tangy blend of bourbon, sweet vermouth and angostura bitters.
Take a look at five of the city's best spots to find the classic drink below:
 





Perfect Manhattan, Bix

For a perfect evening of perfect jazz and perfectly made Kobe beef filet, head to BIX in the FiDi. Start the evening piano side while sipping on their Perfect Manhattan. True to its name, it's a perfect synthesis of rittenhouse rye, dolin dry and carpano sweet vermouth, angostura bitters. Finish your oh-so perfect evening with an order of perfect bananas foster topped with dark rum and vanilla ice cream and -- of course -- another perfect Manhattan.
BIX, 56 Gold Street and Montgomery Street, (415-433-6300 or bixrestaurant.com)

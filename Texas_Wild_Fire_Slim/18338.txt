Each flower has its unique blend of perfume. Together, they create an olfactory melange to awaken the senses. As we hiked, flowers were not the only scents. Lush seepage areas in meadows smelled of organic soil with new green growth. Spruce trees added their own rich scent. Even the light rains and river rapid spray had their own identity. Periodically, these smells, however, were interrupted with the smell of fresh horse manure and urine.We left Do-ke La, where the alpine wind emptied the mind and cleared the nostrils, and headed into the scent-filled meadows and forests below. Rhododendron flowers, past their prime, fell and colored the trails with white, pink, red, and yellow. Avalanche areas, now snow-free, showed me how the Rhododendrons diversified. Within the avalanche zone were red rhododendrons. Along the fringe of this highly-disturbed area were white and pink rhododendrons. Further out, in safer, less dangerous areas, were spruce and fir forests.At Tsasotang meadow, Tsering and I rested before continuing into a dense forest. After eleven hours of hiking, up and over Do-ke La, we finally reached a camp in a small meadow next to the Tsaso Tang River, where we met John and company.After a good night's sleep, I awoke and talked to the other group, telling them we were 600 meters lower in elevation than planned, hence the long walk yesterday. At this point, they felt that that was ok, as they had other places to go. Meanwhile, their guide was hurrying them along: "let's go, rain, rain coming." He was being paid for the entire circumambulation not by the day, so it was to his advantage to go faster.I was in no hurry so stayed at the campsite for a few more hours as the skies cleared.Our hike progressed downhill to a confluence of rivers after a holy pass with a view of the Kawa Karpo range enshrouded in clouds. At this confluence, the forest became subtropical and humid as we had descended to 8,400 feet. From here it was uphill. Tsering continued on and patiently waited for me once in a while. As he knew, I took my time, as I stopped often to look at the sights, the trees, the forest, the birds, the lichens and ferns encrusting the oaks and glowing in the sunlight, creating a halo around the oak skeleton. I also was exhausted; each step was difficult as we climbed switchbacks. I counted my steps, resting every 200 or 400 or 500 steps. I recited the Sanskrit mantra--"Aum Mani Padme Hum"--good for climbing switchbacks and calming the mind.Along the way, birds were calling, parrots were flying overhead, newly-fallen oak leaves and pine needles crunched under my feet, cicadas buzzed with other insects, the river far below droned faintly throughout the gorge, and the wind whipped the trees to life.As the sun was setting, we reached a songrong picking camp at 12,000 feet, where villagers live in August, when the mushroom caps burst from below ground under the oaks and pines, with which they have a symbiotic relationship. The mushrooms are prized in Japan and provide well-needed income to villagers. We picked a small wooden shack and Tsering began to make a fire, which soon became a smokey bonfire within the small wooden shack. I thought I'll wait outside until the smoke and fire die down. At this point, Tsering showed me his pack. He was carrying half the gear and decided to put the unleaded gasoline fuel bottle in the same bag as the food. As Murphy's Law would have it, the fuel bottle leaked. As we removed the food, one by one, a good percentage of the food smelled like gasoline. We salvaged what we could. From here on, I took the fuel--inside my pack but outside the thick plastic garbage bag that protected everything else.After this point--the bonfire, the gas leak--I began to wonder about Tsering's judgement as a guide (not as a person).Finally, as the sparks and smoke abated, I entered the cabin and fell asleep to strange dreams, including a ..."Read and see more at: http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/lraleigh/youarehere./1149579060/...Photos from this trip:1.

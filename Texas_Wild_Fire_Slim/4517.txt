‘Back to the Future’ Shoes Cause Web FrenzyBy Claudine ZapYahoo! Buzz LogPostsBy Claudine Zap | Yahoo TV – 17 hours ago

Michael J. Fox in "Back to the Future II" (Universal/Everett Collection)Remember those imaginary supercool, self-lacing shoes worn by Marty McFly in "Back to the Future II"? Well, the future is now: Nike has created its own version of the shoes and is auctioning off 1,500 pairs of the special-edition sneaker on eBay. Proceeds will benefit the Michael J. Fox Foundation.
Plus, the proceeds will be matched, effectively doubling the amount that will go toward Parkinson's research.
Michael J. Fox, who has the disease and who memorably played Marty McFly in the franchise, appeared on the "Late Show With David Letterman" to get the word out and to show off the cool Nike kicks.
The actor said, "This brings together three populations of people with major joneses. The sneakerheads, the 'Back to the Future' guys, who, believe me, are out of their minds — in a good way! Thank God for them. And also people in the Parkinson's community who have an interest in research." Not to mention people with a jones for Fox himself.


The Nike press release calls the Nike Mag an "exact match" to the shoes in the movie, "down to the contours of the upper, the glowing LED panel and the electroluminescent NIKE in the strap." These shoes don't appear to have laces, but aside from that detail, they come pretty close to the original pair. The press release notes, "The 2011 NIKE MAG illuminates with the pinch of the 'ear' of the high top, glowing for five hours per charge." As PC World put it, "at least they look cool."
The site will offer 150 pairs of shoes a day at nikemag.ebay.com through Sept. 18. Fans should know these shoes don't come cheap. The first pair sold for a whopping $37,500. TMZ reports that the winning bidder turns out to be Tinie Tempah, a 22-year-old British rapper.
Word of the Nike Mag auction immediately sent searches on Yahoo! soaring on "michael j fox" and "marty mcfly shoes."

Glad to see Michael able to get around, my dad had parkinsons when he past away. In such a short time he went from welding amoinia pipes and wiring comercial buildings to where couldn't wipe his nose because he couldn't control his hands! so sad.

Thought about my husband, wish I has $37,000.00 to buy him a pair. The Back to the Future movies are his favorite of all time.

Great shoes, there is only 1 problem! I wouldn't paid $37,000.00 for a pair of shoes, even they are lace free, maybe in the next 50 years then it will price will drop down to $100.00. Love. Back to the Future, but I'll rather take the DeLorean over the these shoes!

They're to help with Parkinson's Disease and there is nothing wrong with that.  They're being auctioned off, so they could go for any price. The first pair, however, we sold for $37,500 because so many people were placing bids on them.  Any Back to the Future nerd would die to have these shoes.  Heck, they would die just to own a Delorean which were piece of crap vehicles to begin with.  It's more or less the movie that made them so expensive and popular.  Trust me, if the Delorean wasn't in Back to the Future, no one would have looked twice at it and if those shoes weren't from Back to the Future, I wouldn't be dying to have them right now.

Haiti leader announces 3rd pick for PM postAP – Wed, Sep 7, 2011





PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — A spokesman for Haitian President Michel Martelly says a one-time aide to former U.S. President Bill Clinton is the leader's official pick for prime minister.The selection of Garry Conille is Martelly's third attempt to install a prime minister since his May inauguration. Lawmakers rejected two earlier nominees.Conille, a physician, could face questions over his residency in Haiti and draw criticism because of his career with the United Nations and U.N. Special Envoy Clinton. He has worked in Niger and Ethiopia.The U.N. presence in Haiti has been sharply criticized after Uruguayan U.N. troops were accused last week of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old Haitian.Martelly's spokesman Lucien Jura made the announcement Tuesday night.

Hey, If they worked in Niger, they can work in Haiti. Haitians and Nigers look about the same to me.

Haiti may be a precurser to USA. Haiti was the first American colony to claim it's independence from european colonialism. Haiti has, and has had as many enemies as us, and maybe even more dumbarss leaders and crooks running it than US. One earthquake,
two good huuricanes and one more goofball at the helm and "folks" in Us will be frying bananas too.     Prayin for a shake up.

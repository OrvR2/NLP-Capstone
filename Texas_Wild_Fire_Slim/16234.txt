   APTexas has asked the nation's fire departments for help in fighting the 180 wildfires across the state.

The San Diego Fire Department will send five people to Texas this week to assist in the overwhelming wildfire situation.SDFD is awaiting orders as to when they will leave, said spokesperson Maurice Luque.
About 1,200 firefighters  battled the blazes, including members of local departments from around  the state and crews from such places as Utah, California, Arizona and  Oregon, many of them arriving after Texas put out a call for help.
The Texas wildfire outbreak  is one of the most devastating in history. More than 1,000 homes have  been destroyed and roughly 180 fires have erupted in the past week  across the rain-starved Lone Star State.

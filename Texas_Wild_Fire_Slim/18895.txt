Birdwell shares 9/11 testimony







	In a moving, and at times emotional talk, State Sen. Brian Birdwell shared his experiences and his faith Sunday at Corsicana’s First Baptist Church.
	Birdwell, an Army veteran who now represents District 22 in the Texas State Senate, was a victim of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2011, badly burned over most of his body when Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon on that fateful day, the third of four planes that terrorists overtook in the attack on the nation.
	With the unwavering support of his wife, Mel, and his faith in his God, Birdwell survived multiple surgeries and procedures and years of rehabilitation. He spoke many times Sunday of his faith in God in seeing him through the darkest times as he recovered from his injuries.

Morgan: Jason the genius?

Guest Commentary: Remembering a national tragedy


	Ten years ago today, was a wake up call — for all of us. You probably still remember where you were and what you were doing. As Alan Jackson's song asks “Where were you when the world stopped turning?” Did you change your attitude towards people? Pray more, read your Bible more? Did you display the American flag with more pride than before? I know as a husband and father, I did.

In the Tree House: Where were you?







	I can’t believe that it has been 10 years since that fateful day. I always remember my parents talking about where they were when JFK was shot, or where they were when Martin Luther King was shot. I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would be one of those people, or at least I hoped I wouldn’t have been, one of those people that had a story to tell my children… “I remember exactly where I was on Sept. 11, 2001.”

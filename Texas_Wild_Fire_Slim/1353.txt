Report: NASA needs to keep more astronauts on handBy MARCIA DUNN - AP Aerospace Writer | AP – 14 hrs ago





CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA needs to keep more astronauts on staff than planned even though no one is being launched from the home turf, a new report urged Wednesday.Many astronauts have retired or quit with this year's end of the space shuttle program. But a robust corps still is needed, the report noted, to fill crew slots aboard the International Space Station and help forge the way for exploration in the decades ahead.NASA's astronaut corps peaked at 149 in 2000. It's now down to 60. NASA projects it will need a minimum 55 to 60 astronauts over the next five years.But the National Research Council warns that may not be enough.Last year, NASA asked the council to look at the role and size of the astronaut corps during this transition time. A committee of 13 experts — five of them former astronauts — conducted the study.NASA's current projected target size for the astronaut corps "poses a risk to the U.S. investment in human spaceflight capabilities," the report stated. It does not offer enough flexibility to accommodate sudden departures or other matters."Reducing the size too much can create shortages of key skills," the report said.In this time of change and uncertainty, "it's even more important that the talent level, diversity and capabilities of the astronaut office be sustained," Joseph Rothenberg, a former senior NASA official who helped lead the committee, said in a statement. "Making sure NASA maintains adequate training facilities is also essential to ensure a robust astronaut corps."Because there's different medical requirements for spending six months on a space station, versus a week or two on a space shuttle, NASA needs extra astronauts on hand in case crew replacements are needed because of illness or disability. Besides those assigned to station missions, astronauts will be needed in Houston to help keep the space station running and deal with any emergencies, help develop future spacecraft, and interact with the public, noted the 102-page report.NASA plans to periodically choose a small group of new astronauts, a good approach, the report said. The last group — consisting of nine — was selected in 2009.Until U.S. companies start launching crews — estimated to occur in three to five years — NASA astronauts will continue to hitch rides on Russian Soyuz capsules launched from Kazakhstan. The Soyuz rockets are grounded and all crew flights to the space station are on hold because of last month's failed launch of space station cargo. The supply vessel crashed into Siberia.NASA said the space station — continuously inhabited for nearly 11 years — will need to be abandoned temporarily if a new crew cannot be launched before the last of the six residents fly back to Earth in mid-November.___Online:NASA: http://www11.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/National Research Council: http://national-academies.org/

If the original shuttles lasted 30 years , why are we not building new ones?   with upgrades they could last 40

Come on boys, buck-up, the space programs is dead; pack your bags and get a real job, if you can find one. We don't even have shuttles any longer, we have to hitch a ride to the worn-out space station with the Russians.

Too bad the people who remember the Moon Landing in 1969 will be dead from old age soon. We could have reached the stars. . . . but lacked the vision. We wanted endless wars in the Middle East, instead.  We could change this, if we wanted to as a nation.
   It would take making heroes out of scientists instead of sports stars and actors; and deciding once and for all that the human race was destined explore space, and that was the goal of every one on the planet to make this so. 
   Not such a bad idea; could give children reason to look forward to becoming a grown up and getting old; that he or she might witness launches that were sending men and women to the stars.

Memo from Obummer to NASA. Dream on. I cut your funding to fatten the wallets of my union buddies. You get no more money period. Stop asking me for money. I have spent it all.
You wanna ride rockets, go to Russia and work for them. Now stop bugging me and fade away.

Thanks Obama and the rest of the last decades worth of politicians for ruining what we dominated for all these years. NASA is done. JPL can take over from here. Very sad that we weren't prepared with a new fleet of Shuttles. Space Station? Worthless. Moon and Mars? Forget it. Kennedy is rolling in his grave in disgust. Don't ever compare him with obozo.

I think they should build more spaceships and train more astronauts at the same time. For what are the astronauts good for if they are only Eartbound. What is the monthly compensation of astronauts anyway? Since they work in space maybe they get paid a hefty sum similar to what celebrities are getting.

Keep them, what for?  If we are not going to send people to space on our own then let the other countries spend their money and resources.  No billions to NASA means we can buy their findings.

If Obama had a SINGLE CLUE he would have pumped more money into NASA instead of his union thug friends.

NASA needs to keep astronauts on hand to fly privately owned space craft into outer space.  If NASA does not have rent-a-astronauts who will fly them China, Japan, Brazil, or Russia?  If funding is found, I know of a new company that will use new technology to fly into outer space.  Who will fly their new space craft?

Why do we need Astronauts?  We no longer have Space shuttles.  We no longer have SkyLab.  We no longer have Apollo.  We no longer have Gemini, We no longer have Mercury.  Oh and the International Space Station is about to be shut down too.  Why do we need any Astronauts at all?  Thanks Obama, not!

1. Slightly reduce the standards.  Instead of bachelors +3 years, or professional degree, how about  reducing to bachelor's +1.  and train them themselves.

(these types can get less pay if they have to starting out)
You can build a corp of 100.

Allow kids to become astronauts.  You'll have thousands.

This would be funny if it were not so serious. They waste billions on the "space shuttle", which really accomplished next to nothing, and abandon any attempts at genuine space travel. They just keep trying to drain the economy, to justify their own jobs. They should either put up or shut up! Do Mars or scale down to a one desk office!! Why keep feeding big business with this nonsense??

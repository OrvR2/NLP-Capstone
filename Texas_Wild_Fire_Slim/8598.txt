   Orlando Plastic Surgeon on Latest ASAPS Statistics on Silicone and Saline Breast ImplantsPRWeb – 1 hr 51 mins ago





   According to the most recent study by the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) breast augmentation was the most popular procedure performed in 2010, with 318,123 total procedures. The procedure has increased 2% since 2009 and over 210% since 1997, a consistent growth that places breast augmentation in front of liposuction and rhinoplasty as the most popular form of surgical cosmetic enhancement. Dr. James Matas, a board-certified plastic surgeon in Orlando, FL, says the surge in popularity of breast enlargement in the past several years is likely a result of the innovation in both silicone and saline breast implants.Orlando, FL (PRWEB) September 08, 2011  The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) released a study recently stating there were 318,123 breast augmentation procedures performed in 2010, making it the most popular cosmetic surgical procedure. At his Orlando plastic surgery practice, the Advanced Centre for Plastic Surgery, Dr. James Matas says he sees firsthand the overall rise in the number of breast augmentation procedures performed.
In 2010, the ASAPS study reports that 62% of breast augmentations used silicone breast implants and 38% used saline. Dr. Matas says that many patients prefer silicone breast implants because they can offer a more natural feel and an improved aesthetic appearance. “Silicone implants look and feel more natural because they have more characteristics of normal breast tissue than saline implants.”
Despite speculation regarding the safety of silicone implants in the 90s, the U.S. Food and Drug Association has conducted in-depth research to certify their safety, and re-approved them for most patients in 2006. Dr. Matas says that the breast implants of today offer improved safety and quality aesthetic results. Whether patients are considering silicone or saline implants for breast augmentation in Orlando, Dr. Matas says he stresses to his patients the importance of consulting a board-certified surgeon. He adds that proper training and experience are essential characteristics to look for in a surgeon for any cosmetic enhancement procedure. “Board certification in plastic surgery ensures that patients are being treated by qualified plastic surgeons that are well trained by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.”
In addition to the increase in breast augmentation procedures, the ASAPS statistics reveal a rise in cosmetic surgery approval by Americans to over 50%. With the growth in approval ratings, Dr. Matas says he hopes the quality and innovation of plastic surgical techniques will continue to improve, as this will in turn lead to improvements in overall patient care and satisfaction.

Texas residents quickly fled as wildfire closed inBy CHRISTOPHER SHERMAN - Associated Press | AP – Thu, Sep 8, 2011

BASTROP, Texas (AP) — Dennis Silman was in line at the store when his wife's urgent call came through: They needed to get out. Smoke was drifting up through the woods and the wildfire that just 30 minutes earlier wasn't near enough to pose a problem was visible over the treetops by the time he got home.In just 90 minutes, Silman was able to make four trips loading clothes and a few important possessions into his Mustang. He could feel the blaze's heat and hear the crackling roar as he packed his car. Less than two hours after they drove away for the last time Sunday, the Bastrop Complex fire consumed his home and six other houses of relatives who all lived within about four square miles of each other."My house, my sister-in-law, her brother, my mother-in-law and three brothers-in-law houses are gone," the 53-year-old bail bondsman said Wednesday outside the county convention center where he came to find out about federal assistance. "Everything's gone now."Fed by stiff winds and extreme drought, the more than 33,000-acre blaze had blackened about 45 square miles in and around Bastrop, about 25 miles east of Austin, leaving two people dead and consuming nearly 1,400 homes by early Thursday, according to the Department of Public Safety. The White House said President Barack Obama telephoned Gov. Rick Perry to say the federal government would continue providing firefighting assistance and quickly assess requests for more aid.Many Bastrop residents said they had received cell phone photos or videos from those who sneaked back into the fire zone or from volunteer firefighters and police who checked on friends' homes. Others were left to crowd around lists of the lost street addresses posted at the county convention center.The fire was about 30 percent contained Wednesday and firefighters hoped to take advantage of low winds to make more progress. The destruction has made the blaze the most catastrophic of more than 170 fires that have erupted in the past week — one of the most devastating wildfire outbreaks in state history, which has been blamed for a total of four deaths.The outbreak has made this the state's costliest wildfire season on record, with $216 million in firefighting expenses since late 2010. The crisis is unfolding months after Perry signed a budget that cut funding to the Texas Forest Service by one-third. Yet the agency insisted that being $35 million lighter hasn't left Texas less equipped to fight the latest fires.Under the new budget, which went into effect last week, no firefighters in the Forest Service were laid off, said Robbie Dewitt, the agency's finance officer. Moreover, the forest service said it will spend whatever is necessary from state coffers to deal with the disaster and have the expenses accounted for later by state leaders.Texas Task Force 1, an elite search team, mobilized Wednesday in Bastrop to search the smoldering ruins for more victims. But several thousand people successfully evacuated ahead of the fire, and Bastrop County Emergency Management Coordinator Mike Fisher said about 2,500 people had stopped by one of the county's shelters. Many more people likely stayed with family or friends.Some residents needed no urging to leave because they saw the flames lapping at the trees. Others heard from friends and neighbors, while still others found a sheriff's deputy at their door or heard firemen rolling down the street with bullhorns. In most cases no one had to be told twice. A wildfire here two years ago drove people from their homes and everyone knew about the severity of the drought.That was the case for Jose "Pepe" Gomez, 57, who had just returned from church to his girlfriend's house Sunday afternoon."We were going to celebrate my girlfriend's grandson's birthday, who is only two ...We were going to have a pool party at her swimming pool, have cake for the kids, then they said 'get out,'" Gomez said. "We got evacuated from three locations on that same day. In less than 12 hours we were evacuated three times.""When you looked up you could see this huge cloud ... we knew it was serious," he said.Gomez said his girlfriend lost everything after having only enough time to grab a little clothing for her kids and a Bible."She was in hysteria when she was told her house was leveled," Gomez said. It was the second home she lost to fire.Brenda Sanders, a 63-year-old hospice nurse whose home had so far survived the blaze, said she had been oblivious to the fire until a sheriff's deputy came to her door. She and her husband had about 20 minutes to gather items. They grabbed the flags that were on their fathers' caskets, some important insurance documents, mementos from her husband's high school and college football career and their cats."It's just been a nightmare," she said. "It's been surreal, the whole experience."Her friend Denise Rodgers, 56, a hospice chaplain, was not so fortunate. Her house in Tahitian Village burned. First, a friend sent her a photo showing her house untouched. "I was thinking I was in the clear." But later she received a shaky video of the flames circling her home and climbing up one side."I could see it coming, you know, over the trees," Rodgers said of her last minutes in the house. "I could see the pink glow so I knew it was close."

I just left Texas last October.  I have many friends still there.  I have been in contact with some, I am so worried for them.  Stay safe Texas!  I hope these fires can be extinguished soon and no further loss of homes or more importantly lives.

Don't Mess With Texas.  Do you think that will still be their slogan?  How about (after this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs):  "This is Texas.  This is Texas on Fire."  Ok. Ok.  I'm sorry.  I just had to make some type of comment on that since I live in New Mexico and everywhere you go, there is a Texas plate on their big Texas SUV with a bumper sticker that reads:  Everything is Big in Texas.  That being said?  That fire should grow over the days to be the biggest in America history.  Hey!  They predicted it and bragged about it.  So sorry to hear about their loss but then Texas can rebuild.  They've got lots of money.  I just hope it doesn't push them up this way.

I hope the people who live in Texas knows that there are those even though they are not there with you in the physical being, are with you in our thoughts and our hearts.
Hang in there, I know you people are there for each other and helping each other through this.  Remeber even at your weakest moments, look up.

The obvious solution to the fire is cutting corporate tax rates.

I've seen fire and I've seen rain.
I've seen sunny days and thought they'd never end.
I've seen loney times when I could not find a friend.
But I always thought I would see you again.

Won't you look down upon me Jesus,
you've got to help me make a stand.
You've got to see me thru another day.
My body's aching and my time is at hand.
I won't make it any other way.

Grow up people,this is bad here in Bastrop. This is real.  Learn from this. Hook em horns!!

My daughter moved to Bastrop two months ago to take her first job after graduating from college.  She somehow missed the evacuation notice and decided to leave her apartment to go swimming with some friends. When she went outside, she was concerned with the smoke and asked somebody hurrying by what was going on.  Told of the evacuation, she grabbed her purse, what clothes were handy, and some papers and jewelry in a drawer-type fire safe.  She got in her car and joined the line of people leaving the area.  Driving down farm roads with no map and a check-engine light, she finally made it to College Station.

My daughter is safe.  Her job may be gone.  She's lost much of what she had: her apartment is reported to have burned to the ground with everything that she couldn't grab in a few moments of panic.  And it offends me to see the partisan, hateful comments of the know-it-all, holier-than-thou, narrow-minded, thoughtless whiners who insist on cluttering the comments about this tragedy with their meaningless derogatory speach aimed at people whose primary failing is that they don't happen to agree with them.

Pardon the run-on sentence and the leading conjunction.

"The crisis is unfolding months after Perry signed a budget that cut funding to the Texas Forest Service by one-third" and your blaming the FED for that? Also I think Governor Perry needs an education about something called the national guard.  Hey Chrisit in NJ had the brains to mobilize the national guard for rain and possible flooding. For weeks this fire has been burning people have died and that is your response. To blame the FED and not even question a governor who runs his own state? Ge real.

I'll bet the Gov't already has a plan to give away billions of dollars to some other Country to study the causes and effects of the fires is Texas.

Funny how Gov Parry held his prayer rally in Houston then Texas started burning after the rally. Just what did he say to God?  You would think he would stay in Texas an try to help putting out the fires instead of running around the country bad mouthing other republicans.

Election rallies banned in Kinshasa: officialAFP – 11 hrs ago

Congolese authorities imposed Wednesday a temporary ban on political protests in the capital Kinshasa over fears of escalating violence in the run-up to November elections, officials said.
The ban, which will remain in place until Sunday, was designed to ensure "a peaceful social environment" during the period when politicians will file their candidacies for president and parliament with the election commission, said a statement from the governor of the capital, Andre Kimbuta.
Both the ruling party and opposition were planning to hold rallies on Thursday, but party leaders told AFP they would respect the ban.
On Tuesday in Kinshasa, an opposition supporter was killed in clashes with police that erupted after his party's leader formalised his bid to run against the Democratic Republic of Congo's current president, Joseph Kabila.
The man's death came when police dispersed Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) supporters demonstrating after the overnight sacking of their party headquarters.
Police said that on Monday afternoon, UDPS supporters threw stones and a petrol bomb at an office of Kabila's ruling People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD).
Early in July and on September 1, demonstrations by the UDPS and its allies degenerated into clashes with the police.
On Wednesday, the archbishop of Kinshasa, the European Union's delegation , the UN mission and the US ambassador all called for calm among the political factions.
"We ask one and the other, as well as the security forces, to maintain their composure, avoid useless provocations and to show calm and restraint," Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya told journalists.
The EU representatives in Kinshasa urged the political parties "not to have recourse to violence", while US Ambassador James Entwistle appealed for an election campaign that is "peaceful, calm and friendly."
Candidates in the presidential and parliamentary elections -- both to be held in a single round on November 28 -- have until Sunday to hand in their dossiers.
Two candidates filed their papers for the presidential race on Wednesday: Vital Kamerhe, ex-head of the national assembly, and Joseph-Francois Nzana Mobutu, who came in fourth in the 2006 election and is the son of the country's ex-dictator Joseph Mobutu, who died in 1997.
The 40-year-old Kabila, who has ruled the vast mineral-rich and conflict-torn central African country for 10 years, is widely expected to seek another term although he has not formally announced his candidacy yet.

Nothing wrong with the son of Mobuto hoping to be president, this is good for democaracy but it may be a tad insensitive dont you think? The wounds are still a little too fresh.

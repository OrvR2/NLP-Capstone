BASTROP, Texas  Hundreds more homes have been razed by a deadly wildfire burning for days in central Texas, the most destructive blaze of dozens raging across the parched state. However, Thursday’s cooler weather had officials again hoping firefighters could make further progress.
Nearly 1,400 homes have been destroyed in Bastrop County, about 25 miles east of Austin, up from around 800 the day before, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire, which forced about 5,000 residents from their homes, remains about 30 percent contained.
“The fire didn’t really move last night,” Rudy Evenson, an information officer for an interagency team brought in by the forest service, said Thursday morning. “There’s still a lot to do.”
The National Weather Service said temperatures dipped to near 60 degrees before dawn, but could later peak in the low 90s.
“Our temperature is going to drop down very low, which will increase our firefighting efforts dramatically. We will be able to do a lot of work,” Troy Ducheneaux, a regional fire coordinator for the forest service, said Wednesday.

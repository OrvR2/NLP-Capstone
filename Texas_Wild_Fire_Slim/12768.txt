Holy SH*T!


MonoPed   September 7th, 2011 - 1:22 pm

I can't imagine what that's like to have coming towards your home. And now I read of the feds turning Texas firefighters away over some pissing contest? Insanity!


Syrin23   September 7th, 2011 - 1:23 pm

They suspect arson.   I hope they catch the SOB who did this and give him the TX death penalty.


NotKennedy   September 7th, 2011 - 1:24 pm

I'll bet that will get some rattlers moving!


Holdmynose   September 7th, 2011 - 1:26 pm

You mean  about them not allowing  all the fire fighting planes to fly?  That's what I read about.


ACKtheo   September 7th, 2011 - 1:27 pm

Amazing footage wow ! it moved so quickly some of the trees didn't even get burned up all the way.


WorldclaZZ   September 7th, 2011 - 1:29 pm

Ruuuuuunnnnnnnnnn!


45coltauto   September 7th, 2011 - 1:31 pm

Yup My wife got blamed for a fire I started when we lived on the farm in Mi. Went like mad in just a few minutes. Volunteers kept referring to it as that lady's fire.
She still remembers.


AngrylilDwarf   September 7th, 2011 - 1:35 pm

Even after 20+ years, I can still smell the smoke. Video is one thing, being there is another.


quivive   September 7th, 2011 - 1:36 pm

Rough times for those whose homes are in the way of the fires, they will need our prayers.   It is truly, a mind numbing example of the grotesque beauty of this planet.   Natural finds a way to renew one way or another and we still are hopeless children trying to harness its determined fury.   My great-grandfather use to burn the field next to his house by pouring some gasoline on it, needless to say, not one of his better ideas.

*** feds turning Texas firefighters away***  
In my best Hoffa/Waters impression…  
TAKE OUT THE FED SON'S OF BITCHES, THEY CAN ALL GO TO HELL, AND I'LL SHOW THEM THE WAY!


mr-spike007   September 7th, 2011 - 1:42 pm

What a timely diversion how hard would it be for the Chimp's Gestapo to do drive by wild fires?….all is needed is a good supply
of Flares and Flare Pistols…..Drive….Stop…..Shoot……Drive…..Stop….Shoot….like magic Endless wild fires…Burn the Enemy…
Gee it Seems like Governor Perry Administration….just can't get a Handle on these Wild Fires a Cruel act of Nature…


FRW55   September 7th, 2011 - 1:56 pm

This reminds me of all the offers to help with the oil rig explosion last year in the gulf and they were turned down by the federal govt.  Insanity!!


scovellj   September 7th, 2011 - 1:59 pm

Seeing this makes me think of the brave men who go into these fires to fight and control them.  Wow.


gwgn02   September 7th, 2011 - 2:04 pm

Sad for the human loss. However when rains return, the re-growth will be huge.  Such is the way of nature.


nceeno   September 7th, 2011 - 2:08 pm

They're gonna make them become a liberal?


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 2:09 pm

Leave it to the free market to contain the fires. Surely a private entity can be formed to contract out their firefighting services to the highest bidder. Competition will drive prices down, and soon there'll be no fires! Problem solved!


nceeno   September 7th, 2011 - 2:11 pm

Dang.
To start fighting that fire, you'll need to start a half-mile downwind.


Cowboy Logic   September 7th, 2011 - 2:19 pm

Will re-planting and re-forestation be part of the Green Jobs portion of Obama's Job-less Speech tomorrow night?


wohlfguy   September 7th, 2011 - 2:20 pm

More inane drivel from the mentally challenged far-left.  Meanwhile FEDERAL GOVERNMENT officials are turning away trained fire fighters in TX – http://biggovernment.com/publius/2011/09/07/gov-o...


AngrylilDwarf   September 7th, 2011 - 2:32 pm

Men AND women. Some of the best wildland firefighters I had the pleasure of working with were women. Credit where it's due.


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 2:37 pm

Trained firefighters my ass. Texans are too stupid to spend money on firefighting. That's why Little Richard Perry slashed Texas' firefighting budget 75% this year. Let the magic of the market take care of it!!.


drdaily   September 7th, 2011 - 2:43 pm

Yes, several friends and family across Texas had to evacuate this past weekend, so far they are ok. This is scary stuff, but what's even more strange is all summer the rain poured east and west of Texas. It was as though we had a glass dome over the state all summer, it was as though we were are "harped." The excuse was that we have a high just sitting on top of us, but that usually removes the humidity and believe me it was humid all summer and no rain. Very strange!


wohlfguy   September 7th, 2011 - 2:51 pm

Those were volunteer firefighters that got cut.   The same ones the FEDS are turning away.  MORON!!


trueblue226   September 7th, 2011 - 2:51 pm

RICK PERRY FIRE.
He cut a hugh part of state firefighting resources which was passed  earlier this year. The two-year budget that took effect last Thursday includes a 75 percent slash to volunteer fire departments — from $30 million to $7 million — and a one-third cut to the Texas Forest Service.  
GOD did not hear Perry's prayers.

wohlfguy   September 7th, 2011 - 2:57 pm

What does that have to do with the FEDS turning away volunteer firefighters?


denniscar   September 7th, 2011 - 2:58 pm

Twisted fire starter


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 3:10 pm

If Little Richard cut their funding, and they're volunteers, they must be unusually useless, if not dangerous. Good for Ricky! We'll all miss Texas, I'm sure!


Holdmynose   September 7th, 2011 - 3:11 pm

Oh my!  The article I read earlier was about the fed not allowing a fleet of fire planes to participate, but I don't know where I saw it to leave a link.  Now it's the fed's problem, they'd better not screw it up.


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 3:12 pm

If they're not good enough for the state to keep on as VOLUNTEERS, why would the feds give them the time of day. Perry should know better than the feds if they could have been helpful, and he's answered with a resounding, "NO!" He's "Fed Up!"


wohlfguy   September 7th, 2011 - 3:15 pm

"unusually useless" Congrats.  You just perfectly described yourself and the rest of the far-left fringe.


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 3:19 pm

He's clearing out the dead wood, and brush, and trees, and housing, and cattle ranches, and farms, and so on. It's The Texas Miracle! Go, Ricky, Go! I'll cling to my memory of Willie Nelson's 4th of July picnic in 1979 at a golf course outside Austin which is now, you can be sure, burnt to a crisp!! AWESOME!!


trueblue226   September 7th, 2011 - 3:27 pm

His supidness is burning people out of their house and killing people.  You are a badminded brute. 
GOD did not listen to Ricky the Perry. It seems satan was listening to him, more fire.


trueblue226   September 7th, 2011 - 3:30 pm

The only place that I have read this is on this site. Give me another link.


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 3:37 pm

Don't blame me, I didn't gamble with the lives, homes, and livelihoods of thousands of Texans. Ricky's Christian Faith and belief in free market principles and limited government had that covered! All Hail Texas!! Doncha just love your FREEDOM?!!


wohlfguy   September 7th, 2011 - 3:54 pm

Go find one yourself.Sent from my iPhone


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 3:57 pm

But what about Ricky's privately funded prayer meeting, "The Response?" And his call for all Texans to pray for rain back in early July? Could it be God thinks Rick Perry's an obnoxious, holier-than-thou pain in the butt who's trying to hide behind religion to excuse his massive incompetence and indifference to the fate of Texans? Say it ain't so!! No way!!


Frisco1522   September 7th, 2011 - 4:29 pm

Pray for the poor folks who have lost everything in a matter of seconds to this.   As quick to wipe you out as a tornado.  Really tragic.
If it IS arson and they catch the peckerwood, he should be put in pain for a long time, then executed.


claspur   September 7th, 2011 - 5:02 pm

I hope Perry brings this clusterfluck up tonight in the debate.
This chit is nuts.


scovellj   September 7th, 2011 - 5:36 pm

Oh stop, get out of here with that whinny garbage.


wilmac   September 7th, 2011 - 6:11 pm

its tragic for those that lost everything.,,but its nature's way of renewing it self.,,
to be honest i was surprised to know that Texas had any trees to burn.,,
in so cal we have 3 seasons,,Earthquake, Fire, and Flood seasons.,,my prayers are
with Texans.,,,The lone ranger rides again.,,hiho silver .,,,,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxIuIxqo2So


mustafamonde   September 7th, 2011 - 6:25 pm

Howsabout diverting some cash away from the generational welfare and pork and put it to good use in the face of a natural disaster. Cutting the feeding schedule of Obama's lobsterhound would help too.


overlandpark4me   September 7th, 2011 - 6:39 pm

Bet a Dem set the fire. it's moving so fast the video looks like it's sped up.


TH3 5K1N M3CH4N1C   September 7th, 2011 - 6:51 pm

BOOSH!


AngrylilDwarf   September 7th, 2011 - 6:57 pm

I call BS on you. You ever been on a fire line? I've trusted my life to some women, and they trusted me with theirs. They deserve some credit.  Call me on this or STFU


BalkanDeputy   September 7th, 2011 - 8:22 pm

Spent April and May in South Texas. Ive never seen an area that was just waiting for a Match.


gotwood4sale   September 7th, 2011 - 10:05 pm

Is this the article you were referring to?

Listen to the new castrati cry when you don't include everyone in a statement. Their panties bunch up when people don't care what they have to say. Get out of my face and grow some balls.


Holdmynose   September 8th, 2011 - 5:19 am

LOL


Holdmynose   September 8th, 2011 - 5:22 am

That is it, Thank you.


HookedOnObonics   September 8th, 2011 - 10:32 am

Were they all inhaling helium in that car?


andyzward   September 9th, 2011 - 10:46 pm

Wow..It's just like tsunami….

Posted: Mon, 12 Sep 2011 12:59:53 MDT
Denver has never had trouble attracting marquee comedy names, and this fall's lineup promises another round of high-profile stand-up shows, including a rare set by one of late-night TV's most polarizing personalities.

Posted: Mon, 12 Sep 2011 10:13:04 MDT
The TV soap opera "The Bold and the Beautiful" wrapped a three-day shooting spree in Aspen on Fridayand from all accounts it went as smoothly as a trip down the beginners' slope on Buttermilk Mountain. Locations included downtown Aspen, the Silver Queen gondola next to Ajax Tavern, the Aspen residence of "Bold" executive producer/writer Bradley Bell, a wedding on top of Ajax Mountain and a ride in Jon Barnes' Ultimate Taxi — the town's famously souped-up livery service.

"Hollywood (Abridged)": Silly. Stupid. Side-splitting. 


Posted: Mon, 12 Sep 2011 08:18:08 MDT
 Theater review:  "Completely Hollywood (Abridged)" is some seriously stupid stuff. Good thing the Avenue Theater has put together three stupidly funny actors to perform it.  Rating: ***

Posted: Mon, 12 Sep 2011 00:18:49 MDT
Any question about whether pop music had an appropriate place in how Denver would mark the 10th anniversary of the 2001 attacks was answered long before the Beach Boys took the stage for Sunday's "Colorado Remembers 9/11" concert at Civic Center.

From the first moments of the first song on Wilco's "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" — the definitive record from one of the definitive bands of the past 20 years — a sense of pain and confusion prevails.

"The Book of Mormon" in Denver: A Mile High slap in the face


Posted: Sun, 11 Sep 2011 02:27:19 MDT
 John Moore column:  Denver's ballyhooed launch of the "Book of Mormon" national tour here should have been a cause for celebration, but its measly three-week visit amounts to little more than a subscription sales tool. Adding to the snub: Chicago gets its own separate production of "Mormon" for at least four months. That and other news of the week.

Bias still taking up residence in "Clybourne Park"


Posted: Sat, 10 Sep 2011 11:44:32 MDT
 Review:  Anyone who thinks we live in a post-racial America is in for a rude — and often riotous — awakening with Curious Theatre Company's compelling "Clybourne Park." The Pulitzer-winning play touches a nerve because nothing strikes us as close to home as home itself.  Rating: ***

Can't get enough of "Annie"? Try the sequel 


Posted: Sat, 10 Sep 2011 11:29:52 MDT
If you love "Annie," the ubiquitous musical about that irrepressible little orphan who solved the Great Depression, unemployment, crumbling infrastructure, collapsed financial markets, hunger and cynicism itself on the strength of her cheery disposition alone, chances are you'll like its lesser-known sequel, "Annie Warbucks," just fine.

Theater: A new national puzzle, but no answer with a power that equals "Angels in America"


Posted: Sat, 10 Sep 2011 09:28:36 MDT
Hardly any play written since 9/11 isn't in some way informed by it. But, 10 years later, why is it that the one play with the most illuminating, specific things to say about America's role in the new worldTony Kushner's "Homebody/Kabul" — was written two years before the attacks?

Review: "Bucky" is repellantly smirky smut


Posted: Fri, 9 Sep 2011 16:35:11 MDT
The story of a budding porn actor undeterred by his, ahem, shortcomings, "Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star" aims to be the grossest comedy of the year and may well succeed.



Classical Music: John Adams' "Transmigration" succeeds as 9/11 eulogy


Posted: Fri, 9 Sep 2011 16:34:22 MDT
No matter how disconnected from mainstream society classical music can sometimes seem, we still instinctively turn to it during collective moments of tragedy and celebration. The greatest classical works, such as Ludwig van Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Requiem, burrow below surface emotions and resonate in profound and lasting ways.

Movie review: "Shaolin" is a martial-arts blast

How much is too much?

Video Games: Violent video games gave Americans a vent for their frustrations after 9/11


Posted: Fri, 9 Sep 2011 16:20:13 MDT
It's no wonder first-person-shooter video games, like the "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare" series, exploded in popularity after 9/11. Instead of promising escapism, they provided an outlet for ordinary Americans to vent their rage and frustration by aiming virtual weapons at otherwise nebulous foreign enemies.

Television: "Rescue Me" helped us exorcise our own demons


Posted: Fri, 9 Sep 2011 16:19:57 MDT
Television tiptoed around 9/11 for a long time. In an industry that normally rushes ripped-from-headlines tragedy to the screen within weeks, the magnitude and shock of 9/11 caused a significant delay.

Architecture: Out of Twin Towers ruins rises a new vision and approach to high-rises


Posted: Fri, 9 Sep 2011 16:18:56 MDT
To say the events of 9/11 brought down architecture in America is more than a glib reference to the brutal destruction of those twin giants in downtown Manhattan. Since that day, building design has suffered across the U.S.

Pop Music: Jay-Z, Rap's most important voice, created a lasting album that made us all New Yorkers


Posted: Fri, 9 Sep 2011 16:18:22 MDT
After the World Trade Center came down, some musicians got angry; others wept openly. There was Toby Keith's flag-waving rage ("The Angry American"), a literal counterpart to Neil Young's more studied sadness ("Let's Roll").

(KPRC) MAGNOLIA, Texas -- More than 7,800 acres have been destroyed in a massive wildfire that stretches across three counties, officials said Wednesday.
Investigators said the fire began along F.M. 1486 near Sandra Dee in Montgomery County about 3 p.m. Monday and crossed into Grimes and Waller counties.
The Montgomery County fire was 85 percent contained as of Wednesday at 11 a.m. The Waller County fire was 50 percent contained, but officials said it flared up again Wednesday morning.
At least 5,000 acres have burned in Montgomery County and 3,000 acres have burned in Waller County, officials said. About 300 acres have burned in Grimes County.
Thousands of residents were evacuated.
In Montgomery County, all subdivisions with the exception of Ranch Crest that have vehicle access from FM 1488 in Montgomery County were opened at noon. Residents returning to their homes will need to provide identification.
In Grimes County, the Lake Hills subdivision remained under an evacuation.
In Waller County, homes in the Stonebridge, Saddle Creek and Remington Forest subdivisions were evacuated.
Waller County officials said about 100 homes, many in the Remington Forest area, have been destroyed.
Two homes were destroyed in Montgomery County and one was destroyed in Grimes County.
In Montgomery County, firefighters said Ranch Crest and River Ranch Park subdivisions were heavily damaged.
"It's like, 'When is it going to end? When are we going to be able to go home?' It's getting very frustrating," evacuee Christine Imhoff said.
Hundreds of families stayed at shelters with only the clothes on their backs.
"I was packing for five people. We only had four minutes to get out," Imhoff said. "We are all feeling a lot of that helplessness."
The Red Cross has provided water, food, baby items and a place for pets.
Three shelters were opened in Waller County:
Waller County Fair Grounds, 22000 Fairground Road in Hempstead
Knights of Columbus, 22892 Mack Washington Lane in Hempstead
St. John's Lutheran Church, 1613 Key Street in Waller
A Red Cross shelter was set up at Magnolia High School, 14350 F.M. 1488. About 200 families gathered there Tuesday evening.
A shelter was also set up at First Baptist Church, 801 East Goliad, in Crockett.
The following roads were closed as of 11 a.m. Wednesday.

Grimes County: FM 1774 at CR 302 is closed all the way south to Montgomery County
Waller County: Everything north of FM 1488 between FM 362 and Joseph Road is closed.
Waller County: From FM 362 to FM 1774, everything is closed.
Montgomery County: FM 1774 from FM 1486 west to the Waller County Line is closed

The Magnolia Independent School District canceled all classes scheduled for Wednesday.
All Waller ISD schools were open on Wednesday.
Four firefighters were taken to a hospital for treatment of heat exhaustion Monday night. One injured his ankle.
Montgomery County officials said donations for fire victims should be coordinated through the United Way at 281-292-4155, ext. 265.
The Federal Emergency Management agency has issued a grant to help in the firefighting effort.
The cause of the fire is under investigation.

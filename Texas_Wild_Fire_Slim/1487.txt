The editors of VirtualTourist.com are apparently not fans of Chicago's public art scene. 
The site, which named its top 10 pieces of bad public art last week, included two Windy City sculptures. At the top of their "bad art" list was the new and and abhorred (for the most part) Marilyn Monroe sculpture near the Tribune Tower. 
The 26-foot-tall sculpture, named "Forever Marilyn," was created by artist Seward Johnson and will be on display until next spring. (Scroll down for photos) 
Reuters has more on Virtual Tourist's hatred of the piece: 
Detractors have found so many things to criticize about this work that it's hard to know where to start: its 26-foot (7.9 meter) scale, its impropriety given that the movie to which it pays tribute is set in New York, and its perceived crudeness given that viewers are able to look directly up the screen siren's dress. Luckily, she'll only be there until 2012.

Virtual Tourist also ripped on "Monument with Standing Beast," a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet located in front of Chicago's James R. Thompson Center. 

"Monument with Standing Beast" photo by 20 Letters via Flickr

"This ten-tonne behemoth is said to represent an animal, a portal, a tree, and an architectural form, but to some it just represents bad taste," Reuters reports. 
Check out the whole list of bad public art here.

				What good is art if it does evoke controvers­y? It's not like she actually wasn't a "sex icon".  Americans are so prude. 
It's art. It draws tourists. It's good for the city. It's only temporary.

				If you analyze the context, (the fact that 50 years ago when Marilyn Monroe was alive a sculpture this brash wouldn't wouldn't be tolerated in a public space) you can see it has more than one dimension. It's kitsch on purpose.

				While this is not something that I consider good, This writer is probably not the best person to criticize art pieces. A lot of the things that people are calling art does not fall into the category of art as such. The modern trend is to the disestabli­shment  of real art by real artist.. Seems that anything that is thrown together is art in the minds of some people..Tr­ue art is not accidental­,but a work that takes more than a few minutes to throw together.

				Kitsch should be excluded. It's meant to be bad.

I wandered through some residentia­l streets of Stockholm, sixties apartment blocks, medium rise that looked recently given a once over. These monolithic monstrosit­ies were humanised and prettified by several squares, or rather chance pieces of ground crossed by paths and patched up with grass. Providing these dead spaces with a half-life were pieces of modern concrete sculpture in the style of  a zombie Henry Moore. Maybe they were climbing frames and I just did not understand­.

The monroe is horrible though.

				Who would approve this and not think things thru. Sure it's art but it is WAAAYYY too much. Maybe on a smaller scale, it would be ok. Perhaps, whomever created this should have went with the the dress from the JFK Birthday celebratio­n. She was well dressed. There are plenty of other poses and dresses/su­its/gowns she wore. How tasteless it is to say, " I had my picture taken between Marylin Monroe's legs!" You know it will be said. It's just twisted and in poor taste. Poor taste for an icon that lived amongst scandal.

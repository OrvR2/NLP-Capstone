OR IS IT? 
WATCH below, and decide:

				This technologi­cal/mechan­ical/art piece was magnificen­t to discover on the open playa or even on the streets of Burning Man...it was breath-tak­ingly amazing and breath-tak­ingly funny to see.  It is just one more thing at Burning Man...and at nowhere else in the world...

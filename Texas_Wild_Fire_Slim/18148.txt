"#Smoke on the horizon is from the huge #fire burning out by Steiner Ranch," quirino254 tweeted. 

A photo from space from NASA astronaut Ron Garen. "The view #FromSpace of wildfires over Texas: Bastrop, Todd Misson, Peter's Chapel today 9/6/2011 16:13 GMT."

"Running from the #CentralTXFires in Bastrop," kurtito tweeted.

"Texas is burning. #fire #bastrop #Austin #iphonography #smoke," misssarahla tweeted.

 
"A panoramic photograph of the Grimes-Montgomery County wildfire," @AlexSantz tweeted, "as seen from Todd Mission, Texas."

And a video. Really shocking how quickly wildfire can spread.

'Sex and the City' Prequel 'The Carrie Diaries' a Go at the CWBy Lesley Goldberg | The Hollywood Reporter – 20 hours ago

The rumored Sex and the City prequel is a go at the CW.
After hearing the pitch Friday, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the young-skewing network is moving forward with the project based on The Carrie Diaries, the book series written by Sex and the City author Candace Bushnell that follows Carrie Bradshaw during her senior year of high school in the early 1980s.
The project hails from Warner Bros. Television and Fake Empire (run by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, pictured at left), with former Sex and the City scribe/co-producer Amy B. Harris attached to adapt and serve as showrunner. Fake Empire's Len Goldstein also is attached as an executive producer.
The first book in Bushnell’s origin story was published last year and, like Sex and the City,
 is told from Carrie’s point of view. It follows the aspiring writer 
through her relationship with Sebastian Kydd and rivalry with popular 
girl Donna LaDonna.
	STORY: Sarah Jessica Parker on the Possibility of ‘Sex and the City 3’
The second novel in the series, Summer and the City: A Carrie Diaries Book,
 was published in April and revolves around Carrie’s first trip to New 
York. Both books have been big sellers, with Bushnell signing on this 
summer to pen two additional young adult novels.
Bushnell would likely carry an executive producer credit on the project.HBO owns the rights to the series, with corporate cousin the CW 
hearing the pitch Friday and commiting to the project immediately 
afterward. If it goes to series, the project would fit into a CW lineup 
that already includes such young- and female-skewing fare as The Vampire Diaries, Gossip Girl and 90210.
STORY: Kristin Davis Opposed to ‘Sex and the City’ Prequel
A Carrie Diaries adaptation would mark the second project based on Bushnell’s books this development season.
ABC is adapting the scribe’s 2008 book One Fifth Avenue, with Gossip Girl producer Josh Safran attached to pen the project. Bushnell and Grey’s Anatomy’s Mark Gordon will produce One Fifth, which is being described as Sex and the City meets The Good Wife.
Michael Patrick King, who produced the long-running HBO comedy, told reporters last month that he was “not working on any Sex and the City prequel” and that he wasn’t interested in seeing the franchise move in that direction.
STORY: Michael Patrick King Says He Has ‘No Connection’ to ‘Sex and the City’ Prequel
“My Carrie Bradshaw started at 33, and I took her to 43. I didn't even want to know who Carrie
 Bradshaw's parents were because I thought she only existed in 
Manhattan," he said at the Television Critics Association’s summer press
 tour in Beverly Hills.
"So for me, the idea of going backwards and making her less evolved ... is something that I don't imagine doing," he added.
Schwartz and Savage, both repped by WME, are heading into their own block of programming on the CW this fall with Gossip Girl and freshman drama Hart of Dixie set to air back-to-back on Mondays starting Sept. 26. Harris, whose credits also include The Comeback, is repped by CAA.Email: Lesley.Goldberg@thr.com; Twitter: @SnooditOther Popular Stories on Yahoo!

Why the huge fuss over Sarah Parker? She isn't that hot actually she is rather skanky looking. I just donm't know why she is the star of the show...Oh wait she is tehe executive producer no wonder she gets so much air time..

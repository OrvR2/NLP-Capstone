The Metaphysical Celebration was held once again at the Denver Merchandise Mart this past weekend, welcoming spiritual guides, artists and holistic healers from all over the nation. 
“Along the Colorado Front Range is a highly spiritual, very meditative area,” says Kelly R. Sheridan, a metaphysician in her fifth season with the celebration. “A lot of people [here] are very in tune to the new age, new paradigm thinking.”
See for yourself; check out our photos of Denver’s Metaphysical Celebration.

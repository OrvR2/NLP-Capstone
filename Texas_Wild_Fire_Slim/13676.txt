Police in Leander, Texas, said they are looking for four teenagers who are suspects in a fire that destroyed 11 homes Monday evening. The four include two boys and two girls, police said.
That fire destroyed homes in the Mason Creek North subdivision.Â  Authorities estimate the damage at $1.4 million, said Connie Watson, spokeswoman for Williamson County.
For nearly 300 days, wildfires have been taking a toll on drought-stricken Texas, scorching communities and creating dangerous conditions.

Hopefully these bozoes will be caught and prosecuted to fullest extent of the law. What they did was inexcusable regardless of how young they may be!!!

Hi, fernace-I have read your posts, but not addressed you formally. It is dry in Missouri too, the grass is not worth mowing, cause its dead. It was hot here also,(102-104) but this week it is in the high 70's, low 80's, with nights in the 60's. Sending cool thoughts your way.

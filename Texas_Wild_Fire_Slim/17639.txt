One Man’s 175 Classic Car Collection Destroyed By Texas Wildfire

5:41 am                            0 Comments



Well, this just sucks!
A Shelby Cobra, ’47 Studebaker pickup, ’66 Pontiac GTO, several mid-’50s Chevrolets as well as a dozen Corvettes have been destroyed by the wildfires sweeping across Texas, and all were owned by one man. John Chapman, 70, had his entire 175 classic car collection reduced to ashes.
Despite the loss, John says his house and family are safe and continues on to say you can either laugh or cry. He’s chosen to laugh.
I’d be crying.

Jaguar Unveils C-X16 Concept, Brings Small & Sexy Back (Video)

8:55 am                            0 Comments


Jaguar C-X16 Concept
Jaguar has opened the floodgates on their long-teased and gorgeous new C-X16 concept. And it is a looker! Unlike the C-X75 and aimed for the world’s elite, the C-X16 has been designed to take dead aim at Porsche’s venerable 911.
It is a hybrid, but have no fear. This baby Jag (which is in fact shorter than the new 911) boasts some impressive performance figures. The new coupe tops out at 186 mph with a 0-62 mph time of 4.4 seconds. Most impressive, however, is the C-X16′s ability to go from 50-75 mph in just 2.1 seconds! Despite these numbers, it can also scoot around town on electric power alone with speeds up to 50 mph. 

Making all this possible is a supercharged 3-liter V6 producing 375 horsepower and 332 lb-ft of torque as well as an electric generator mated to an 8-speed gearbox. When not scooting casually through town, the C-X16′s hybrid drive (powered by brake regeneration) comes into play with a steering wheel mounted ‘Push to Pass’ function. This adds an extra 94 horsepower and boosts the torque figure by an extra 173, a modern day equivalent of a go-baby-go nitrous boost I guess.
Jaguar C-X16 Concept
The C-X16 is damn sexy, especially from the rear 3/4 view. I particular love the high visibility and upward angle of the rear exhaust. This exhaust design as well as the side-rotating rear hatch are not just beautifully but  pay tribute to the company’s iconic E-Type.
My only hesitation is that the C-X16 in its current form borders on a bit too over-the-top coming off a bit tuner-ish. That said, however, this is a ‘concept’ and any production version of its base model will no doubt have a less muscular stance while the design we see here will no doubt resurface with the inevitable (and highly anticipated) V8 models.

Porsche Boss Confirms Upcoming Addition Of Ferrari-Fighter To Lineup

1:00 pm                            0 Comments



Sure, Ferrari has had the thorn of Lamborghini in its side since the late ’60s, but with the powerhouse that is Porsche, it is a bit mind boggling the only real competition the German automaker has ever put up against the Prancing Horse was back with the Carrera GT and way back with the 959.
While hinted at before, Porsche boss Matthais Mueller has now confirmed the company will be adding a new model into the mix slotting in between the 911 GT2 and forthcoming 918 Spyder to give Ferrari a run for its money. MSRP for the Ferrari-fighter is expected to range from roughly $360,000 to $580,00.
This is definitely good news. My only hesitation from getting too excited, however, comes with the thought of which model in Ferrari’s lineup are they intending to go after? With all the rumors and scuttlebutt of Porsche developing a next-generation 928 with a front-engined GT tourer, the company’s new model could simply be this vehicle with official word we are to take it as competition to Ferrari’s 599.
This better not be the case. When I think Ferrari-fighter, I think mid-engined, 2 seats (no 2+2), and ready for a track day. And while I’m very much looking forward to Porsche’s GT tourer, I’m just hoping its something else entirely to which Mr. Mueller is eluding.

Unconscionable! Ferrari Enzo Abandoned In Dubai!

12:53 pm                            0 Comments


Ferrari Enzo abandoned in Dubai
As you well know, this is a Ferrari Enzo. One of only 399 built for the public and it’s rotting beneath Dubai’s desert sun.
While this wouldn’t be the first time the area’s rich treat one of the world’s rarest and most treasured vehicles with utter disregard, word is that most of these examples are now occurring not just out of laziness, but after owners have fled the country due to failed business ventures.
The good news is that this particular exotic was spotted in a police impound lot and can therefore be saved when it’s put up for auction.
Nobody knows the damage done from its bake in the 115 degree heat, but with a pristine Enzo selling around $1.5 million, we’re sure someone will snag this horse.

It’s Official: All-New Porsche 911 – My, What Big Wheels You Have

9:50 am                            0 Comments


2012 Porsche 911 Carrera S
So, it’s that time again. Porsche has unveiled the all-new 911 and is sending it to Frankfurt for its first appearance in a couple weeks. Codenamed the 991, the new model is 3.9″ longer, sits a bit wider, and has dropped 100 pounds. Both the base Carrera and the Carrera S produce more horsepower (350 and 400) yet consume less fuel than their outgoing counterparts. The interior has also been shifted to be more in line with that of the Panamera.
With 48 years of what occurs like the most minimal design evolution possible, Porsche has long been the brunt of jokes focusing from laziness to boredom in a market surrounded by GT-Rs, Aston V8 Vantages, and Lotus’ Evora. I’ve long shared this point of view. Even Porsche themselves mention ‘evolution, not revolution’, yet if you’re like me you may see a bit more than usual in this newest generation.
Catching my attention are new exhaust outlets, a wider spoiler and sleeker taillights, but an actual surprise is the abundance of badging across the rear. Where before we’d simply see which variant in 911 range the vehicle represented, ’911′ is now added in front of the variant branding and sits just below the full ‘PORSCHE’ badge seen on the rest of the company’s lineup. Is the company no longer secure the entire world knows these are 911s? or Porsches for that matter?
2012 Porsche 911 Carrera 
Despite some noticeable changes, I have to ask – Do we care? Does it matter? It’s always occurred to me that if you’re in the market for a 911, you will simply scoot down to the dealer, attempt to discern which of the 23 variants (!) match your lifestyle, and grab the latest model. I can’t imagine any buyer standing in the showroom contemplating what’s been slightly altered from the model they saw cruising by years ago. Hell, even those seeking a pre-owned model from before any so-called facelifts or previous generations will barely give it two thoughts.
Don’t let me fool you though, I love the 911. It’s quintessentially German, expertly engineered, I love driving them, and it’s everything I want in a sports car (performance-wise anyway). I just can’t get excited for a 911.

It’s Official: Ferrari Debuts 458 Spider With Video

9:48 am                            0 Comments


Ferrari 458 Spider
And yes, it is gorgeous! Ferrari has dropped the top a bit early on the new 458 Spider before its official debut at this year’s Frankfurt Motor Show next month. Though most in the industry were convinced the new berlinetta would indeed feature a folding hardtop of some sorts, immense speculation surrounded exactly how the company would achieve such an engineering feat given the car’s tapering rear design.
Ferrari 458 Spider
The ingenious result is a mechanism closer to the flip-style lid of the older 575 Super America rather than the ‘standard’ style found on the California. After flipping back, the roof is concealed below the rear deck lid in just 14 seconds. This means, however, that to have the wind in your hair it’ll cost you, and others, the ability to see the car’s incredible 4.5-liter V8 that’s visible so prominently in the 458 Coupe.
No doubt that the new 458 Spider will go down as one of the most gorgeous roadsters of all time. It certainly has our votes.

1934 Voisin C-25 Aerodyne Takes ‘Best Of Show’ At 61st Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance

9:23 am                            0 Comments


1934 Voisin C-25 Aerodyne 'Best Of Show' Winner
Peter Mullin and his wife’s 1934 Voisin C-25 Aerodyne has snagged the ‘Best of Show’ award at this year’s Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance. The Voisin beat out of a field of 227 vehicles during the 61st outing of the prestigious event.
A mere 28 examples of the C-25 chassis were created between 1934 and 1937 and only 8 received the Aerodyne body. Its ‘fixed roof’ slides back over the trunk creating the sunroof opening and one of the earliest and sleekest ‘targa’ models we’ve ever known. It is powered by a 3-liter sleeve-valve type motor with two carburetors producing 100 horsepower with a top speed of 85 mph.
Peter Mullin is an avid connoisseur of French automobiles and is of course the man behind the must-see Mullin Automotive Museum in Oxnard we visited last year (where two other extremely rare Voisons are on display). This is his first ‘Best of Show’ win in his 27 years of displaying vehicles at Pebble Beach.

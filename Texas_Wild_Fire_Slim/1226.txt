we need a president that would lower the food , gas,and give us jobs. they need to help us not didn't country's. the price of living is going up and are wages are going down. every time we give raises the price's of living go up that means middle class and poor people never gain anything from work because we work are tail off but don't get anything to show for it. we need some one will stand up for us and fight for what we want not other country's, or keep the jobs here and lower the taxes on food, gas and housing. so  people can live again.

Slick Rick and Willard Romney were disappointing, and I don't say this because we're at different spectrums ideologically. I say this simply because their performances were so poor. I actually applaud the performances of Cain, Gingrich, and Huntsman. Sadly, Santorum and Paul gave good efforts, but came up short. Bachmann resembled a fish out of water. To sum it all up You could cut the nervousness and tension with a knife. One thing that stood out. Perry probably hurt himself with TRNTPK (those republicans not tea party kooks) with his strong, rather defiant defense of Social Security being a ponzi scheme---and his absolute denial of science. Like Lucy, he's got some 'splainin to do regarding these statements. Read my columns on associatedcontent@fasteddiekc

FACT CHECK: This is AP/GOP propaganda. All eyes are not interested in seeing and hearing more of the absurd ravings of Perry, the self-proclaimed Christian prophet who denies proven science or the other extreme radicals full of Tea Party anti-government madness.

RON PAUL PLEASE MAKE THIS YOUR YEAR

oh and to the Rick Perry "Ponzi Scheme" remark, i really dont see how anyone can look at the path social security is on and not call it a "Ponzi Scheme"

I dont really agree with him on anything else but social security "as is" which is what Perry said, is basically a "Ponzi Scheme"

I bet those Perry goes the distance. With the Fox right wing propaganda network steadily pumping out "fake news" by our coporate overlords, half the population will vote for the Perry whose proven even worse than bush with his corporate cronies. Geez they really dug in during Bushes term including the supreme court. Executive descion to force 12 year old girls to have a shot for sexually transmitted cancer for the profite of a pharmicutical company? Perry's involvement with a teachers' life insurance scam where Wall street and Phil Grahm, the mastermind behind the 2003 commodity act that did away with position limits--resulting in high gas, oil and raw commodiy prices-- tried to get teachers to sign over their life insurance policy to Wall Street. Did you notice that half the popultion in Texas doesn't have health insurance? ONly failed because the press caught onto it. Great cash in on teachers death. Can one go lower? I ask again, Do we really need another corporate crooney president willing to offer the public again to corporate greed?

At approximately 8:45 a.m. on August 24, federal agents raided Gibson Guitar Corporation facilities in Nashville and Memphis, making off with an estimated $1 million worth of Gibson property. Gibson’s alleged crime? Using imported wood from endangered trees. At least that’s what the company assumes the feds have in mind. Gibson hasn’t actually been notified of any charges against the company. In fact, according to a Gibson press release, they still haven’t been told on what charges “more than a dozen agents with automatic weapons” raided their factory and stole their property in November 2009. They’re being forced to sue in federal court to get their property back, and even there the government is stalling, having requested an indefinite stay of the case.

Both raids appear to stem from allegations that Gibson imported wood from foreign countries in violation of the Lacey Act. Originally enacted to prevent trafficking in endangered species, the act was amended in 2008 to include plants. According to the Rainforest Alliance:

the law makes it illegal to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any plant, with some limited exceptions, taken or traded in violation of the laws of the U.S., a U.S. State, or relevant foreign law. The U.S. government can use this law to impose significant penalties on individuals and companies who are found guilty of such acts.

Wood being a plant product, any company that imports any wood-based product must, as the Wall Street Journal put it, meet “every regulatory jot and tittle” of the country from which the wood was harvested — and, says Gibson, that applies “if you did not observe a law even though you had no knowledge of that law in a foreign country.” Moreover, because (in the words of the Rainforest Alliance) “the ban on illegal timber as defined in the Lacey Act amendments has not been supported by a clear framework of regulation that sets guidelines for importers, exporters and traders,” it leaves the government a wide range of discretion to persecute businesses that have run afoul of politicians, political appointees, and bureaucrats. Lew Rockwell may have been onto something when he suggested that the attacks on Gibson have precious little to do with preserving trees and much to do with the fact that the company “failed to bribe the right people in DC.”

The 2009 raid concerned wood imported from Madagascar, which the Justice Department maintains was obtained in violation of Madagascan law. “Gibson,” says the company’s press release, “has obtained sworn statements and documents from the Madagascar government and these materials, which have been filed in federal court, show that the wood seized in 2009 was legally exported under Madagascar law and that no law has been violated.”

This year’s raid seems to be about wood from India. The Justice Department “has suggested that the use of wood from India that is not finished by Indian workers is illegal, not because of U.S. law, but because it is the Justice Department’s interpretation of a law in India,” Gibson explains. “This action,” the company hastens to point out, “was taken without the support and consent of the government in India.”

In other words, if the U.S. government thinks a U.S. company has violated a foreign law in the course of importing wood products, it then charges (or at least raids) that company under the Lacey Act, confiscating the company’s property and fighting tooth and nail to retain it. This happens whether or not the United States’ interpretation of the law agrees with the foreign country’s interpretation of it and whether or not the foreign country has made a formal request to the U.S. government to charge the company with a violation of its law.

Gibson, for its part, seems to have gone out of its way to comply with the Lacey Act, making sure that its wood complies with Forest Stewardship Council standards, which include ensuring that wood is harvest

There were legions of self-sacrificing heroes on September 11th, 2001, from the civilians that did their best to rush co-workers out of the falling Twin Towers to the emergency response workers that rushed into the carnage to pull out victims for hours, days, weeks and then months. With the butterfly effect of actions and fate, there were also countless untold stories of accidental heroism, little moments that, in the end, ended up saving lives, too.
Gwyneth Paltrow, it turns out, was one of those accidental heroes.
Speaking at a press conference for her upcoming film, "Contagion," the actress talked about a chance encounter on the street that kept a Lara Lindstrom Clarke, a 24-year old at the time, from entering the World Trade Center that day.
"Basically, what happened was I had gone to a yoga class very early. I was on the way home and it was the morning of September 11 -- not that I knew at the time what that meant -- and a girl was jaywalking across the street and we kind of both stopped at the same time and waited a really long time," she said in Venice (via the NY Post). 
After a bit of confusion over who should go -- Paltrow in an SUV, Clarke walking in the street -- and subsequent laughter between the two, they each went on their way.
"Ten years later I got a letter from her saying that she had been late for work and we had that thing and she went down to the Christopher Street station to catch her train to go down to the World Trade Center where she worked on the 77th floor of the South Tower and the train was just pulling out," Paltrow continued. "So had we not had that interaction she feels like her life would've taken a much different course."
The woman called it her "Sliding Doors," moment, harkening back to Paltrow's 1998 film that sees Paltrow's character discover the two fates that would await her depending on whether or not she caught a certain subway car.
 The Daily Mail reports testimony from Clarke herself, including the letter she sent Paltrow to tell her of the story and thank her.
The story is also reminiscent of films such as "The Butterfly Effect" and last winter's "The Adjustment Bureau," the Matt Damon-starring film about shady underworld agents who "adjust" peoples' fates by changing small instances to keep them on their designated course in life. Damon, as it so happens, stars as her husband in "Contagion," the deadly virus thriller from Steven Soderbergh.

Steven Weber: A Family, A Nation


		                        
																In the decade since 9/11, the country has in many ways reacted the way a family would if their home had been attacked and destroyed and members of their family killed, the family's nerves and fortunes stretched to never-before-considered breaking points.                             







Rev. Dr. Martha R. Jacobs: Playing Poker with Police at Ground Zero


		                        
																I am so thankful for the opportunity to serve those who were there to protect us and recover the remains of those who died. It was not something I never envisioned when I answered a call to serve God.                            







Bishop James Magness: Spirituality Forged in Smoke and Fire


		                        
																That day, I began learning that the affirmation of our spiritual differences is the only vehicle through which we can build the framework for common ground.                            







Rev. Earl E. Johnson: Providing Disaster Relief with the American Red Cross, 10 Years After 9/11


		                        
																What has emerged in my experience is that those who have training and experience with the chronically ill also make good disaster spiritual care providers, without exception.

				Wow!!!! How does Gwenyth do it all!!!   I also heard she was a member of Seal Team 6, that she's the favorite for the 2012 Olympic figure skating title, and, that she's a girl scout leader even though she doesn't have a child (although she did carry her BFF's child to term).  If everything I read about her isn't true, she at least has the greatest publicist of all time!

				Perhaps it's the train conductor who is the accidental hero. Perhaps his clock was off by a few moments and he left the station early. And perhaps his watch was off because of a faulty battery. And perhaps the battery was faulty because the line-worke­r in the factory spilled their water on it. And perhaps, that line-worke­r spilled her water on it because her co-worker sneezed and it startled her. And her perhaps her co-worker'­s sneeze was the result of another co-worker'­s perfume, which was a gift from her boyfriend, who was trying to apologize for an indiscreti­on, an indiscreti­on which involved a stripper. (I like crediting strippers with saving lives.) But, nah... let's give it to Gwen.

				I could watch her personally carry out the barely walking cherubic twins, a roly poly pup and Nana with the pot roast strapped to her back in 6 inch Louboutins and still not like her. She gets under my skin. 

You know how you just KNOW if it was 10,000 ya, you wouldn't politely quelle the disquietin­g instinct she is evil in some manner? Which leads to you to be primally forced to ponce her over the head with a blunt object before she first grants the favour to you. I had to. It is for the good of the human race.

				A hero?  No.  An instrument of circumstan­ce?  Definitely­.  I am so glad that the woman who was on the way to the Towers, happened to be distracted by seeing Ms. Paltrow.  But - IMO, this story is more of a random thing, instead of an act of heroism.  And, this is the second time this story has been posted?  I cannot help but think of the nameless, faceless people in this tragedy - who were in the towers that day...who bravely chose between life and dea.th to save the lives of others...p­eople who could have chosen to just get out themselves­, but in their selfless humanity..­.they did not.  I just kinda shake my head at this headline, that's all.....

				There was a similar thing with Seth McFarlane. On 9/11, he was late to American Airlines Flight 11 and the ground crew wouldn't let him on the plane because they had already closed the doors. Flight 11 was one of the planes that flew into the WTC. A few minutes delay can be life changing.

				Try reading.  The first part describes how those selfless acts are on a whole different level than:

"there were also countless untold stories of ACCIDENTAL heroism, little moments that, in the end, ended up saving lives, too."

When a life is saved or taken, does it REALLY matter what the original intent was?  I think not.

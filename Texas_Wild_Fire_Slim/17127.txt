Firefighters On Twitter; How To Find Them
4 comments






Thousands of firefighters tweet, some focus on their job, some rarely mention work on their Twitter page. I have a policy of following every firefighter or first responder that I can find on Twitter on my account no matter what they post in their updates.
There are many ways to find firefighters on Twitter.  Here are some techniques I employ.
1. Mine the followers list of a firefighter you follow looking for firefighters.
2. Under search users in Settings type in the search term Firefighter.
3. Follow a user generated list like this one. Mine the list and add users you want to follow.
4. Place a query for “firefighter” in Twitter Search.
5. Attract fellow fire/ems brothers and sisters to your account by using keywords associated with the job. You will be found.
Another list I am trying to develop is for fire departments. The list is sparse so far but in spare time I intend to expand it using the same mining techniques outlined above.
I want to add as many Fire, EMS and Fire Departments as possible to my following list. Follow me here and I will follow you back!

Guest Post: How Does Your Department Track Training?
Comments Off






From Ilya Plotkin, Program Administrator, TRAIN
Training is key to ensuring that a workforce is prepared in case of emergency or activation. This is particularly true for professions where practice and experience are vital, such as firefighting, law enforcement, and other emergency responders. Each emergency has its nuances and it is difficult to track training and also to identify gaps in training without a system capable of doing so.
      Today, many organizations employ learning management systems (LMS) to manage and track employee training. The LMS can serve web-based and classroom-based training centers, allow the tracking and reporting of training, and can provide a means of centralized information. There are a variety of LMS options available, from built-to-order systems, to pre-built systems, to free platforms.
      The LMS with which I work is TRAIN (https://www.train.org), a LMS that is free to all users and course providers. TRAIN, a community of 22 states and 2 national organizations, is geared specifically toward public health and safety professionals. The TRAIN Community utilizes economies of scale and sharing to avoid “reinventing the wheel” and ensure the preparedness of their workforces. Of the approximately 315,000 users on TRAIN, 31,515 identify their primary job role as “Emergency Responder.” 
      Most importantly, TRAIN allows organizations, health departments, and fire and police departments to become Course Providers and post both classroom-based and web-based courses either to a limited audience or to a wider audience. Any organization can utilize the system to track attendance and progress of a single training or a set of trainings.
      This brings me to the question that we would like to ask: how does your department or academy currently track training? Is training tracked via a LMS, on paper, or via a database system such as Access or Excel? What experiences have you had with a LMS or online system in the past that may lead you to either promote or avoid them today? We would like to hear your responses…

Snow Blankets 2009 California Fire Grounds
4 comments






Snow covers the 2009 fire grounds from north to south as the California fire season is finally put to bed. The season officially ended last month but in truth the season never ends. With near certainty I think 2009 is done.
Though it won’t take long for the hills to dry and the winds to return in force at least for now firefighters can rest.
I wanted to show two views of the Angeles National Forest where the 160,000 acre Station Fire burned this past August and September.

Then and now from the Mt. Wilson tower cam.

The image below was captured from the Lick Observatory HAMCAMS on 4,200 ft Mt. Hamilton east of San Jose in the San Francisco Bay Area.
A few readers here will recognize the Copernicus Lookout at the top of the peak. One July 4 (circa 1981) I took my crew to the Lookout and we could see fireworks as far away as San Francisco…….

Wildfire Report From Michael Archer’s Excellent Blog
Comments Off






I don’t know how he does it but Michael Archer manages day after day to gather the most interesting and pertinent news and information on wildland fire issues.
Michael’s Firebomber Publications Blog is a must add to your blogroll.
Within his recent report is a link to survey results from residents in the path of fires on Australia’s Black Saturday, February 7, 2008.
Michael is always the first to report news about firefighting supertankers.

September 7, 2011 - The National Interagency Fire Center reports that Texas is continuing to experience major wildfires that have not let up since early Spring. Just yesterday, the Texas Forest Service responded to 22 new fires for 7,544 acres, including 10 new large fires.
Over the past seven days Texas Forest Service has responded to 181 fires that burned 118,413 acres. It appears that in the past 48 hours, more than 700 homes have been destroyed.
This is the worst wildfire season Texas has ever experienced and is entering its sixth month with no let up. The Texas Forest Service has asked the United States Forest Service to lead the fire fighting effort which has overwhelmed state forestry resources.
I have created this Current United States Wildfire Maps and Condition Reports site where you can get current fire location maps and more information  on the Texas wildfire situation. Critical wildfire conditions are expected to continue.

Texas is the “Lone Star” state, not the “Longhorn” state, except maybe for UT fans.

Thanks!  I am not a Texan and have screwed up big time. Lone Star it is and I need to turn off ESPN…

Thanks for starting this page. The most useful and powerful Texas wildfire map available on the web is here:  http://tx.dtswildfire.com/. This interactive system is based on authoritative data that is updated as soon as new conditions are reported. This includes daily updates to TFS fire locations, Nexrad radar (animated), wind speed/dir, RH, precipitation (unfortunately not a big issue in Texas right now!), news alerts, MODIS fire detection points, Texas Wildfire Risk Assessment data (fuels, risk and threat), and more.
It also includes a number of powerful mapping tools such as address search, zoom to active fire locations, active perimeters (shown in transparent red), Inciweb RSS tool (this lists all the RSS feeds issued by Inciweb, filtered by Texas, and by selecting the fire will zoom you to the fire, and provide the direct link to the Inciweb page about that fire), social media search tool (YouTube, Flickr, Twitter), legend legend for visible layers, bookmarks to revisit specific locations, draw & measure, printing and more.
Best of all – it is free!

ab_forestry,
Howdy!  Too funny about “Longhorn State!”  Don’t feel bad, as the name is actually quite fitting!  Even in populated suburbs of my great state, longhorns can be found!   
GIS_Forester,
That website is great, as it’s the type of site I was looking for.  Thank you!

The US Forestry Dept. has bulldozers, helicopters and several airplanes deployed over western Somervell County(Glen Rose area) and yet there is nothing on the news anywhere about this fire.

There is a way to build houses that will not burn.  Nor will they be destroyed by a hurricane or tornado.  They are also termite-proof.  They will last centuries.  It has been done on the island of Guam for fifty years. Look it up on the internet.  They are about the same cost as the bonfire houses commonly being constructed in North America.

Adobe Flash finally comes to Apple iPhone
Technology | Latest News |	September 9, 2011 at  5:13 am     









It looks like Adobe Flash and finally bringing Apple’s iPhone and other devices IOS, but do not think Apple has had a change of heart now that Steve Jobs has gone. Adobe Flash Media Server 4.5 Access 3.0 and Adobe Flash products will bring Flash content to IOS devices, but not through traditional means Adobe has been used.
General works Adobe Flash Mobile using a program that uses the processor in the device to view its contents. Jobs criticized it is too costly and can damage the battery and overall system performance. Adobe’s latest products take care of this processing on the server so that users can gain access to the IOS and Apple can not really block it without going through extreme measures would probably be more trouble than it’s worth.
The new Adobe Flash products for content producers and this will allow them to use their existing workflows to target users IOS and other mobile users without having to transition well. This includes the ability to do live streaming, and digital rights management included.
This is good news, such as access to more content is always a good thing, but you have to wonder if Adobe has been dominated in the Apple. The lack of Adobe Flash on iPhone and iPad seems to be more a matter of years ago, but many users and publishers have changed. In addition, customize the content to play on devices IOS gives you access to an audience of Apple, but it is also compatible with other mobile platforms.
Adobe Flash Player is pretty good on the platforms it’s on, but publishers are still the best way to display that content on small screens. Do not think I’m too hard on Adobe if, as has also created many tools for content HMTL5 too.

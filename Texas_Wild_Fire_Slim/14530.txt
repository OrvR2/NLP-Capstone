Riley Road Fire Update - September 11, 2011 - 10:45 a.m.Location: Montgomery, Waller and Grimes Counties, TexasDate of Fire Start: Sept. 5, 2011 Cause: Under Investigation Size: 18,468 acres -acreage has been dropped due to more accurate G.P.S. measurements of the fire perimeter. Containment: 65 percent - this number is based on the percentage of the fire perimeter that has secure lines around it. It is also a measure of confidence that fire supervisors have on the ability of these lines to hold the fire. Management: Unified Command (Texas Forest Service, Grimes County, Waller County, Montgomery County, and California Incident Management Team 4). Fire Status: The Riley Road Fire activity was moderate on Saturday thanks to the significant progress made in line improvements during the Friday night shift. Fire activity did pick up in the afternoon, as the temperatures increased and the relative humidity decreased. Several small spotovers ignited across the lines on Saturday, but were quickly contained by the unified front of air and ground resources. Black Hawk Helicopters, air tankers and volunteer engines doused spotovers as soon as they occurred. Activity along the western edge of the fire was light throughout the day. Overall fire crews had a very successful day. Overnight fire intensity was again reduced due to increasing moisture from the southerly sea breeze allowing night operations to continue make significant progress on line improvement and mop up operations. Firefighters will continue to improve fire lines today and mop up any hot spots along the fire edge, focusing on the 100 feet into the fire interior. Firefighters will also be fireproofing around existing homes inside of the burned area protect them from any unburned fuels. With westerly winds predicted for the afternoon, the eastern edge of the fire will be the most critical area for firefighters to work. Total Aircraft resources on the fire include: 4 Single Engine Air tankers (SEATS), 4 C-130 air tankers, 4 Black Hawk Helicopters, 1 Type One Helitanker, one DC-10 Air Tanker, 1 Type Two Helicopter, and 1 Type Three Helicopter.

Weather Outlook: A surface ridge of dry high pressure will maintain a dry air mass over the Lone Star State into early in the week as it gradually begins to shift on off to the east of the area. Winds across the panhandle and deep south Texas south of Interstate 10 will have a southerly component today. Even as dew points begin to increase in some areas, warmer temperatures will lead to continued low relative humidity. Among the driest locations in the state today will be those near the Interstate 35 corridor and east, where winds could be around 10 mph sustained for a brief period in the afternoon to early evening. Wind gusts approaching 15 mph are possible in this area. High temperatures will continue on a warming trend ranging from the mid-80s to upper 90s in most places. However, high temperatures will exceed 100 over some parts of South Texas.Poor overnight recoveries will continue for areas away from the coast, especially locations west of Interstate 35. Very dry conditions again today. Light and variable winds in the morning becoming northwesterly 6-8 mph gusts to 10-15 mph. the sea breeze should move into the areas south of a Woodville to Conroe line late in the afternoon. Afternoon humidity falling to 11-16 percent except south of the sea breeze where relative humidity will only fall to around 35 percent. Skies will be mostly sunny throughout the day in the north and will become partly cloudy after 10 a.m. in the south. Afternoon highs 92-101. Moderate overnight recoveries of 55-65 percent north and 75-95 percent in the south.BASTROP COUNTY FIRE COMPLEX-----UNIFIED COMMAND NEWS RELEASE  MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION ISSUED-PROGRESS CONTINUESSaturday, September 10, 2011, 2:30 PM As progress on the Bastrop County Fire Complex continues, State Highway 71 was re-opened today at 8 a.m. Union Chapel residents were also able to return to their homes today at 10 a.m.Judge Ronnie McDonald announced at a press conference today that a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of Texas was issued by President Obama, triggering release of funds to help individuals whose homes and property were destroyed by the Bastrop Complex fires. Individuals are encouraged to register with FEMA by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or:· Those who use 711 or Video Relay Service (VRS) can call 800-621-3362.· Apply for disaster assistance online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov.· Smartphone or tablet, use m.fema.gov· FEMA’s App for android phones download at market.android.com/details?id=gov.fema.mobile.android Hotel vouchers are also available beginning today for those currently living in shelters. This allows citizens whose homes were destroyed to move from makeshift shelters into motels until more permanent housing is re-established. Vouchers may be picked up at shelters. Residents may also dial 2-1-1 for statewide services and disaster information.Sheriff Pickering emphasized that, “Fire crews and utility crews are working hard in order to get residents back into their homes as quickly and safely as possible.” He stressed that unsafe conditions prevent allowing residents to re-enter during this phase of work. After a fire burns through a residential area, many hazards still exist because of the disruption of the infrastructure in place such as affected electrical, water, gas, telephone lines, crude oil wells, roads, dead trees and limbs, and smoldering stump holes. Re-construction and re-charge of live electrical power lines is also taking place by 120 utility crews in order to restore power so residents may return to their homes. Fire crews are cutting and removing hazard trees that may fall at any time with light wind gusts. A night shift of firefighters is patrolling the perimeter of the fire to ensure hot spots are extinguished so that fire does not flare up. An infrared flight has been conducted for the last three nights to detect hot spots within and around the fire perimeter so firefighters can be directed to these specific areas. Law enforcement is patrolling evacuated areas at all times to prevent looting.

Riley Road Fire Update - September 10, 2011 - 10:30 a.m.Location: Montgomery, Waller and Grimes Counties, TexasDate of Fire Start: September 5, 2011 Cause: Under Investigation Size: 21,619 acres Total acres burned by county are as follows: Grimes County: 2,414 acres, Waller County: 13,484, Montgomery County: 5,712 acres.Management: Unified Command (Texas Forest Service, Grimes County, Waller County, Montgomery County. Fire Status: The Riley Road fire, also referred to as the Tri-County fire, continues to grow in size due to the extreme drought conditions in the area. Overnight fire intensity was reduced due to light southerly winds bringing in moisture from the gulf. This break in the weather allowed dozer crews to make substantial progress in building line along the fire edge. Weather predictions for today include more hot and dry conditions with north-northwest winds at 5-10 mph gusting up to 15 mph. Fire behavior is predicted to pick up again this afternoon as moisture levels drop off. The southern edge of the fire remains the hottest and most active part.Firefighters will work throughout the day to install fire lines along uncontrolled fire edge, widen existing fire lines, and mop up hot spots along the perimeter and 100 – 500 feet into the interior. Crews will also be vigilantly patrolling the entire fire perimeter, watching for for slop overs. Air resources are a critical part of the firefight and will continue to work closely with engine and dozer crews on the ground. The 11,000 gallon DC-10 Air Tanker will be supporting these firefighting resources again today. Totsal Aircraft resources on the fire include: 4 Single Engine Air tankers (SEATS), 4 Black Hawk Helicopters, 1 Type One Helitanker, one DC-10 Air Tanker, 1 Type Two Helicopter, and 1 Type Three Helicopter.

However, he expressed concern over public perception that little progress has been made. In fact, the forward progress of the fire has been stopped.Few wildfires are ever actually “put out.” In most cases, firefighters work to build containment lines around the fire and strengthen those lines to make them secure. The focus is to keep the fire from escaping containment. Sometimes the lines are made by one or more bulldozers. Sometimes a road, river or other secure, defensible barrier is used, but, the goal is always to keep the fire from escaping and growing larger. In most cases, wildfire burning within containment lines has little to no impact on local communities, so the fire is considered to be “contained” based on the percentage of the perimeter that has secure lines.In the case of the Bastrop Fire, there are hundreds, even thousands, of homes within the perimeter lines of the fire. Firefighters are not simply attempting to keep the fire within the containment lines. An equally important goal is to protect those homes that have survived the fire and are located within the fire perimeter. Because they are located in close proximity to active fire and because of the historic dry conditions and abundance of unburned fuel, these homes are still seriously at risk.Tony Wilder, Incident Commander for the Southern Area Red Team, explained, “Fighting the Bastrop Fire is extremely complicated. Because there are many homes at risk within the perimeter of the fire, we have to divide our attention between securing the perimeter and protecting homes that are still at risk. This takes a lot of time and work. There has been much progress made, as evidenced by the areas that have been opened for reentry. On this fire, progress must be recognized as more than ‘percent contained’. We have to look at all the areas that have been made safe by firefighters, as well as containment. We simply haven’t had a measure for expressing how much progress we’ve made.”Citizens are reminded there will be hazards in local communities as a result of the Bastrop Fire for weeks, even months. In many cases, the root systems of trees are compromised, and the trees could blow over in even a light wind. As the trees die, needles leaves and branches will fall to the ground, creating a new fuel base. Fire that has smoldered unseen can ignite bringing fire back into the area and threatening homes again. “Everyone is working together to ensure the safety of the citizens of Bastrop County. Help us by being patient and trusting that we will provide you information as soon as we have it,” added Judge McDonald. “We will get through this.”Current information will be available by the front entrance of the Bastrop Convention Center, on bulletin boards at the Bastrop Walmart, Home Depot ,Lowe’s- and the official evacuation shelters.

The pressure gradient will be strongest near the Interstate 35 corridor today, where winds should again be around 10 mph sustained for a few hours in the late afternoon to early evening hours. Relative humidity this afternoon will be similar to yesterday afternoon, with minimum relative humidity below 20 percent across most of the state. High temperatures will range in the 80s and 90s in general, but will approach 100 over Deep South Texas. Poor overnight recoveries will continue for areas away from the coast, especially locations west of Interstate 35. Dry conditions will continue as high pressure over the Southern Plains continues to push dry air over the East Branch. Winds will be lighter with more variable through the morning hours becoming north and northeast during the afternoon 5 to 8 mph with gusts up to 15 mph. Mostly sunny skies with afternoon highs in the upper 80s to mid-90s. The relative humidity will fall back into the 12-20 percent range and 25-35 percent south where a late afternoon sea breeze will creep inland. Poor to moderate overnight recoveries 50-60 percent in the northwest to 65-85 percent in the east and south.Wildfire update – Sept. 8, 2011Current situation:· Yesterday Texas Forest Service responded to 20 new fires for 1,422 acres, including new large fires in Red River, Smith, and Cherokee/Rusk counties. · In the past seven days Texas Forest Service has responded to 176 fires for 126,844 acres. · A more comprehensive assessment has been completed on the Bastrop County Complex by FEMA and the State Operations Center.

Weather Outlook: A surface ridge of dry high pressure will maintain a dry air mass and northerly component to the flow to most of the Lone Star state. A surface trough of low pressure in place over the panhandle during the afternoon will lead to some gusty winds at times over the far northern portions of the panhandle where an isolated shower or thunderstorm could occur. The pressure gradient will be strongest near the Interstate 35 corridor today, where winds should generally be strongest sustained, around 10 mph for a few hours in the late afternoon to early evening hours. Relative humidity this afternoon will be slightly higher than yesterday in most places, but the majority of the state should experience minimum relative humidity below 25 percent. Many areas will fall to the 10 to 20 percent range. High temperatures will range in the 80s and 90s in general, but will approach 100 over Deep South Texas. Poor overnight recoveries are expected again for areas away from the coast, especially locations west of Interstate 35. Dry conditions will continue as high pressure over Texas and Oklahoma moves very slowly east. Northeast flow 6-10 mph, with gusts to 12-15 mph will be common. Partly sunny skies with high clouds moving into the northern areas, and sunny skies across the south will allow afternoon high temperatures to climb to 85-92. Relative humidity values fall to 14 to 20 percent in the northwest and 18 to 30 percent across the southeast. Poor to moderate overnight recoveries of 50 percent in the northwest to 60-65 percent in the east and south are expected.

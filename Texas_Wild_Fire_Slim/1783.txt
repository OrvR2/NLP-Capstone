US man loses appeal in Aruba missing tourist caseBy DILMA ARENDS GEERMAN - Associated Press | AP – 15 hrs ago





ORANJESTAD, Aruba (AP) — An Aruban court on Wednesday rejected a Maryland businessman's attempt to reverse an order detaining him as a suspect in the presumed death of his travel companion in the Dutch Caribbean island.The ruling from the three-judge panel means that Gary V. Giordano will have to remain in custody at least through the end of the 60-day investigative detention period imposed on Aug. 31."Of course he's very disappointed and sad about this decision," his attorney, Michael Lopez, said outside court.Lopez had argued that authorities do not have enough evidence to detain Giordano as a suspect in the presumed death of Robyn Gardner, a 35-year-old woman from Frederick, Maryland, who traveled to Aruba with him for what was supposed to be a five-day trip.Giordano, who is from Gaithersburg, Maryland, and owns a temporary staffing business, was arrested as he tried to leave the island on Aug. 5. Prosecutors have said they initially detained him because he gave inconsistent statements about Gardner's disappearance.The prosecution has disclosed little of the evidence against Giordano but has said he was the beneficiary of a $1.5 million accidental death insurance policy he took out on her before their trip.Giordano has told Aruban police that Gardner was apparently swept out to sea as they went snorkeling off the southern tip of the island. Authorities have searched the coastline near where she vanished and parts of the island but her body has not been found. Richard Forester, an on-again-off-again boyfriend of the missing woman, said Wednesday that he is trying to organize a new search effort.

The whack job is a murderer plain and simple. You don't take out a 1.5 million dollar policy on a person you hardly know.

US man loses appeal in Aruba missing tourist case... HA! HA! 

Let me go to Aruba and "interview" him... We will know within an hour what really happened to the girl and, if he killed her, where he hid or disposed of her body. (Or we could just ask Joran's friends, the Kalpoe brothers, since they have experience hiding or disposing of the bodies of blond women in Aruba)

Anyone want to go with me to assist in the "interview?"

Let's see if I have this right... She met him online and immediately went on vacation with him.  Seems like a smart thing to do, right?  Common sense:  A lost art...

Don't we teach our kids to NOT talk to strangers?  This wh0re meets a stranger online and travels with him to Aruba???  Is anyone really shocked that this is a headline story?  I'm not!

Aruba is a great and safe island.

Aruba is not the problem.  A tramp that meets a guy on the internet and travels with him IS the problem!  She got what she bargained for by traveling with a stranger.  This is all on her, not the island!!

Wow the guy is suddenly rich.  I doubt the insurance company will pay under these circumstances. But he could always send the claim form in from jail.

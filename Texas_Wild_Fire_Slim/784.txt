Top Stealth Home Energy Hogs




                      by William PentlandThursday, September 8, 2011

The relentless rise of electricity prices over the past decade has made many consumers more conscientious about how they use electric power. Many of those conscientious people may find it frustrating — to put it mildly — that their daily or even hourly efforts to turn off devices they're not using hasn't delivered the results they'd expected.More at Forbes.com:  America's Most Toxic Cities   What Your iPhone Apps Know About You 10 Money Saving Ways To Boost Your Cars Fuel EconomyThe blame belongs to the growing number of "vampire" or "phantom" electronic products that populate today's typical home. An alarmingly large number of electrical products cannot be truly turned off without being unplugged. These 'vampire' products draw power 24 hours a day whether "on" or "off."These devices draw so-called standby power when they are off, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), which has recently completed a large survey that measured the "standby power" in hundreds of products.So what is "standby power"?...standby power is electricity used by appliances and equipment while they are switched off or not performing their primary function. That power is consumed by power supplies (the black cubes—sometimes called "vampires"—converting AC into DC), the circuits and sensors needed to receive a remote signal, soft keypads and displays including miscellaneous LED status lights. Standby power use is also caused by circuits that continue to be energized even when the device is "off."Based on LBNL's those results, Clean Beta created the following list of 26 electrical products that consume the most juice while they're "off." More specifically, the list ranks the most profligate electrical products based on the average number of watts they consume in "off" mode.A watt is a measure of power — Joules/second — analogous to speed — miles/hour. So, to calculate watts, power must be converted into energy (like speed into distance). Here's an example: if a device draws 1 watt constantly for a year, then its energy consumption was 9 kWh. That corresponds to about $1.00.While a single device consumes very little in annual electricity use, when multiplied by several dozen products, you're no longer talking about chump change.An individual product draws relatively little standby power, but a typical U.S. home has forty products constantly drawing power. Together these amount to almost 10% of residential electricity use. Altogether, standby power use is roughly responsible for 1% of global CO2 emissions.What can you do? It is not easy to reduce the amount of standby power many devices use, but it is possible. In fact, research has found that an aggressive effort can reduce standby use by about 30%.Here are a few strategies:Use a switchable power strip to pull the plug on clusters of computer or video products.Buy low standby products if you can find them. Don't ask a salesperson though because they probably won't know. Better to look for ENERGY STAR products, which are tested for profligate reliance on standby power.Buy a low-cost watt-meter, measure the devices in your home and take targeted action.If all else fails, pull the plug, but be careful not to get electrocuted in the process.Here are the top 10 energy that consume the most energy.   Photo: Business Wire  No. 1: Set-Top Box* Average Watts While Off: 28.286 Average Watts While On: 30.198 *Average includes DVR, digital cable, digital cable with DVR, satellite, satellite with DVR.No. 2: Notebook Computer Average Watts While Off: 8.90 Average Watts While On: 29.48   Photo: Wikipedia  No. 3: Inkjet/Multifunction Fax Average Watts While Off: 5.31/5.26 Average Watts While On: 6.22/9.16No. 4: DVD/VCR Average Watts While Off: 5.04 Average Watts While On: 13.51   Photo: Wikipedia  No. 5: VCR Average Watts While Off: 4.68 Average Watts While On: 7.77No. 6: Central Heating Furnace Average Watts While Off: 4.21 Average Watts While On: 339.71   Photo: Wikipedia  No. 7: Cable Modem Average Watts While Off: 3.84 Average Watts While On: 6.25No. 8: Multi-Function Laser Device Average Watts While Off: 3.12 Average Watts While On: 46.98   Photo: AP  No. 9: Cordless Phone With Answering Machine Average Watts While Off: 2.92 Average Watts While On: 3.53No. 10: Desktop Computer Average Watts While Off: 2.84 Average Watts While On: 73.97

0 users disliked this comment AlecSkwirl 3 minutes ago Report Abuse The premise of this article is totally correct, but the wattage   calculations   are way OFF line.. the numbers shown aren't any ware in the ball park, in fact you should be hard pressed to find an electrician that does not agree.. with out a load no current is flowing. So, These units plugged in and OFF shall be considered in Standby, and yes there is some electrical activity happening, but it is not as fierce as this article would have you believe..Simply shutting stuff off your not using saves a tremendous amount of POWER..............

Then when you're plugging and unplugging your appliances many start to break down due to electric part failure (which mostly break down when current spikes plugging or unplugging). Then you pay thousands in repairs, and if you have to replace it, the energy necessary to build that appliance will make mother earth cry... 

All because some yahoo article writter doesn't bother to run real usage tests because there is no way this guy actually does this in his home.

0 users disliked this comment Bob F 9 minutes ago Report Abuse Yes, it is necessary to assess energy usage like this, but the energy draw of most of these devices was already known.   A practical solution will not exist until manufacturers build automatic off capability into these products.   Americans have demonstrated many times over the years that saving energy is not a primary objective for them.   We will pay for more energy rather than lose convenience.   This is not a criticism--I fall into this category.

0 users disliked this comment Spelchek 16 minutes ago Report Abuse So I can unplug my furnace and my cordless phone and answering machine and save 7 watts?    Unplugged the phone won't ring and the heat won't come on.   I'll spend the extra 75 cents a year for the use of these devices. If you really want to save watts, get rid of your hairdryer. That baby uses over 1500 watts.   
There is a reason why things have a standby mode.   don't mess with it!

0 users disliked this comment David 21 minutes ago Report Abuse an easy way to 'compensate' for neccessary 'vampair' devices is to produce the same amount of electricity.   Add up all the devices's total watt/hours in your home, including TVs, Chargers, Cable Boxes, etc.   Most of you will find that it will be less than a magic number of 300 watts.   Purchase two solar panels that add up to your total watt/hours and a grid-tie inverter.   While doubling your watt/hour number in solar panels you can compensate roughly for nite time(no light).   Setup the panel array in front of a window or make a nice setup outside.   Your little project that costs less than $1000 will easily produce the 'vampire' power you use, lowering your electric bill and thus help lower CO2 production.   It's a nice project and really rewarding!

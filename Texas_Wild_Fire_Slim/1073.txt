Poll: 66 percent think American power has declined since 9/11By Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – 14 hrs ago

Lt. Richard Rogers, a former stockbroker, conducts a presence patrol in Kabul, Afghanistan …A large majority of Americans believes the United States has spent too much in troops and treasure in the last decade responding to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and that as a result, American economic strength and power abroad have declined, according to a new poll by the University of Maryland and the Program on International Public Attitudes.
"Overall, two in three (66 percent) believe U.S. influence has diminished in the world over the last decade, and this view is highly correlated with the belief that the U.S. over-invested in responses to 9/11," wrote Shibley Telhami and Steven Kull, the poll's key architects,  in a summary of the key findings released on Thursday.
The American public is showing "a little tiredness of the military option," Telhami, the Anwar Sadat professor at the University of Maryland and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told The Envoy Thursday. That's reflected, he said, "in the degree to which they support the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq and Afghanistan."
A majority of those polled--57 percent--said they still support the decision to go to war in Afghanistan, but half of the respondents--50 percent--say they now believe the United States has invested too much.
"At this point a large majority--73 percent--wants the U.S. to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan, but less than half want them to be withdrawn completely," Telhami and Kull wrote.
President Obama's strategy on Afghanistan wins wide support from Democrats as well as Republicans, the poll found. "When asked what they think of the Obama administration's strategic choice to try to strengthen the Afghan army while reducing U.S. forces and attempting negotiations with the Taliban, a very large majority--69 percent--approves," Telhami and Kull wrote. Sixty percent of Republicans approve, along with 62 percent of independents, and 83 percent of Democrats.
On the issue of the war in Iraq, however, the American public remains far more divided.
A slight majority--55 percent--said too many resources have been spent in the Iraq war, but 45 percent said the decision to invade Iraq was the right decision, while slightly more--49 percent--said the Iraq war was a mistake.
"While 66 percent of Republicans thought the war was the right decision, only 31 percent of Democrats and 38 percent of independents agreed," Telhami and Kull wrote. "Similarly, 69 percent of Republicans thought going to war in Iraq helped the American effort against international terrorism, while 35 percent of Democrats and 40 percent of independents agreed."
The poll was conducted from Aug. 19 to Aug. 25 with a sample of 957 adult Americans. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.

This is a complete and unpatriotic lie.  With our Satellites watching the worlds every move and the capability to put a nuclear missile in anyone’s pocket anywhere in a moment’s notice,  the belief we are second to anyone  is from a uninformed and probably uneducated person.

The stats resulting from such polls have little to say to us without knowing exactly what the questions are that solicited the responses.Thus these poll results mean absolutely nothing unless we can see the questions. Additionally, the tone and slant of the article is clearly promoting one point of view so that certainly makes one insecure about the poll and how it is being reported. This is typical of reporting these days and it serves the public badly.

One can lead a orse to water............ will it drink?
The US wants, with the very best of intentions, to allow the peoples of, say Iraq, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, to become free from bondage and to let them take charge of their own lives. But if the librated peoples do not want to be free, want to live under the yoke of ....... hey these are all islamic countries...... and feodal culture bondage of fear and poverty, better leave them some time to realize that they are in a swamp (from western perspective). They have an different outlook on life altogether. May they? Many of those peoples value life differently. e.g. in the horn of Africa we see many people parish. Do the peoples care themselves about this as western cultures?

Nobody promised it would be easy.  Radical Islam declared war on the USA on 9/11.  Unlike previous wars, these guys don't wear uniforms and they don't represent any national entity.  Getting rid of them is like swatting flies.  Killing a few doesn't much alleviate the situation; one has to keep after them and sooner or later their population gets thinned down, but it doesn't happen quickly.  

We are now making a big display of emotion around the tenth anniversary of 9/11.  If this is to be more than eyewsh, we all need to renew our efforts to insure another 9/11 never happens and that the 3000 who died are, if not avenged, at least not swept aside in history because the American population got tired.

Its a big stratego game and everyone wants to control natural resources in spite of borders.  Otherwise we would make more peace sending food, clothes, and shelter rather than missles , drones, and bombs, and it would be cheaper  :D

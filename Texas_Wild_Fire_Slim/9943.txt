It's no wonder that with her sister hogging the headlines, we haven't been vigilantly tracking Lindsay Lohan's little sister's every adolescent phase. But we couldn't help but notice that the former freckled redhead has gone through quite the transformation. 
Lohan stepped out looking all grown up, sans her former face full of freckles. The little Lohan recently signed a multi-year contract with Next Model Management and we have a feeling her new look has something to do with her new gig. 
What do you think of Lohan's transformation?

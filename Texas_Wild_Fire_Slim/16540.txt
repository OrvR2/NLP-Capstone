Jay Carney: Obama Job Plan Paid For! Not a Debt Ceiling Buster. Really!
September 7, 2011By MaggieThe White House is in it so deep. Obama’s job plan “will be paid for” Press Secretary Jay Carney told the White House Press Corp today, refused to say how. When pressed about a new stimulus “busting the debt ceiling,” Carney said that will not happen…because you know….there are “complexities.” Before Carney started the session, he realized he had brought the wrong notebook to the podium, and said he was going to “shuck and jive.” That’s just what he did. It’s what his boss does every time he’s in front of a mic, and both look lame doing it. Sounds racist to me.
Shuckin' and Jivin'

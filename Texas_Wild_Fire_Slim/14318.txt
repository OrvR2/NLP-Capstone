Winds fueling massive Texas wildfire finally calm




 
BASTROP, Texas      (AP) -- One of the most destructive wildfires in Texas history is  slowing down thanks in part to calming winds, but stretched-thin  firefighting crews have yet to gain any control of the blaze that is  plowing across rain-starved grasslands now littered with hundreds of  charred homes.
Raging with zero containment  for days, the wind-fueled fire has destroyed more than 600 homes and  blackened about 45 square miles in and around Bastrop, a city near  Austin. An elite search team on Wednesday will begin looking for more  possible victims of the fire, which has killed two people and forced  thousands to evacuate.
Crews finally got a  reprieve Tuesday from winds pushed in by Tropical Storm Lee that whipped  the blaze into an inferno over the weekend. Increased humidity was  moving in overnight, and officials were expected to report some  containment in the morning, Texas Forest Service spokesman John Nichols  said.
"Tonight should be a good night,  tomorrow should be a good day - we hope," Nichols said late Tuesday.  "The reason why it hasn't been able to be contained is the wind. We  still have a lot of active fire on the line, but today was the first day  we had very light wind."
The blaze is the  most catastrophic of the more than 180 fires that have erupted in the  past week across Texas, marking one of the most devastating wildfire  outbreaks in state history. The fires have destroyed more than 1,000  homes, caused four deaths and pulled the state's firefighting ranks to  the limit.
In a housing development near  Bastrop, Willie Clements' two-story colonial home was reduced to a heap  of metal roofing and ash. A picket fence was melted. Some goats and  turkeys survived, but about 20 chickens and ducks died in a coop that  went up in flames.
"We lost everything," said  Clements, who with his family took a picture of themselves in front of a  windmill adorned with a charred red, white and blue sign that  proclaimed, "United We Stand."
"This is the beginning of our new family album," the 51-year-old said.
Texas  Gov. Rick Perry cut short a high-profile presidential campaign trip to  South Carolina to deal with the crisis, and on Tuesday toured a  blackened area near Bastrop, about 25 miles from Austin. He later  deployed Texas Task Force 1, the same search team sent to New York  following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and to New Orleans in the  aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
"Pretty  powerful visuals of individuals who lost everything," Perry said after  the tour. "The magnitude of these losses are pretty stunning."
The  conservative Republican said he expects federal assistance with the  wildfires but complained that red tape was keeping available bulldozers  and other heavy equipment at the Army's Fort Hood, about 75 miles from  Bastrop. The post was fighting its own 3,700-acre blaze.
White  House spokesman Jay Carney said the Obama administration has approved  seven federal grants to help Texas with the latest wildfires.
About  1,200 firefighters battled the blazes, including crews from as far away  as California and Oregon. Five heavy tanker planes, some from the  federal government, and three aircraft capable of scooping 1,500 gallons  of lake water at a time also helped.
The  disaster is blamed largely on Texas' yearlong drought, one of the most  severe dry spells the state has ever seen. The fire in Bastrop County is  the most devastating wildfire in Texas in more than a decade, eclipsing  a blaze that destroyed 168 homes in North Texas in April.
At  least 11 other fires exceeded 1,000 acres Tuesday, including an  8,000-acre blaze that destroyed at least six homes in Caldwell County,  next to Bastrop County. In far northeast Texas' Cass County, a  7,000-acre fire burned in heavy timberland. And in Grimes County, about  40 miles northwest of Houston, a 3,000-acre fire destroyed nearly two  dozen homes and threatened hundreds more.
In  at least one neighborhood in Bastrop, flames hop-scotched a street where  houses were tucked among oaks, pines and cedar trees. The Postal  Service delivered mail to burned homes where only mailboxes were left  standing.
John Chapman's home on about 20  acres was only singed and had some smoke damage, but the vintage-car  collector lost about 175 vehicles he kept in a garage or under pole  barns. His losses included about a dozen Corvettes and a Shelby Cobra.
As  ashes swirled and tree stumps still spit flames, the 70-year-old  Chapman pointed out the melted remains of a 1966 Pontiac GTO, a '57  Chevrolet pickup and a 1947 Studebaker pickup, and said: "You can either  laugh or you can cry. You might as well laugh."
"The house is safe, my wife and I are alive and good, and I'm not going to worry about it," he said.
About  40 people who fled their homes were staying at a community center in  the town of Paige. A volunteer, Debbie Barrington, said some people have  been sleeping outside on picnic tables under a pavilion, eating food  and using toiletries donated by folks not hurt by the fires.
"The  first night, we had a child 17 months old," she said. "We didn't have  milk. The next morning, I think we had eight gallons. People heard what  we needed and brought it in. The response has been unreal."

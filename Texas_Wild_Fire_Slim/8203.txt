Heavy gunfire in central, north Syria; 11 killedBy ZEINA KARAM - Associated Press | AP – 14 hrs ago





BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian security forces unleashed a barrage of gunfire Wednesday, killing at least 11 people and leaving thousands cowering in their homes as President Bashar Assad's troops kept up the government's assault on a 6-month-old uprising, activists and witnesses said.Nine of the dead were in Homs, a hotbed of opposition to Assad's autocratic regime. Two others were shot dead during raids in Sarameen, in northern Syria.In a step the opposition says shows the regime is intractable, a planned visit by the Arab League secretary general Wednesday to push Assad to make major concessions to defuse the crisis was called off at the last minute at the government's request.Arab League Deputy Secretary-General Ahmed Ben Heli told reporters in Egypt that Elaraby will now visit Damascus on Saturday. He said the decision was made in a phone call between Elaraby and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem.For days, security forces have been pursuing activists and anti-government protesters in Homs, part of a ferocious crackdown on the most serious challenge to the 40-year Assad dynasty. The U.N. says more than 2,200 people have died in nearly six months of protests."All through the night, there was shooting. The gunfire didn't stop," a resident of the city told The Associated Press by phone Wednesday. "I can't tell exactly what is going on because it's dangerous to go out."He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.Omar Idilbi, a spokesman for the Local Coordination Committees, an activist network, said security forces simultaneously stormed several districts in the old part of the city, including the Bab Dreib, Bab Houd and the Bayada neighborhoods. Nine people were confirmed dead in ongoing shooting in those areas, the LCC said.The London-based Observatory for Human Rights, which has a network of activists across the country, said 10 were killed.Homs, Syria's third-largest city, has seen some of the largest anti-regime protests in Syria over the past months, despite repeated crackdowns.On Tuesday, security forces opened fire from a checkpoint in Rastan, just north of Homs, killing two people, including a 15-year-old boy, activists said. They said five unidentified corpses, including that of a woman, also were found dumped around the city center.Mobile telephones, land lines and Internet connections in some parts of Homs were cut off Wednesday. Many people were staying home because of roads blocked by security forces. Others were too scared to leave.State-run news agency SANA said a "terrorist group" kidnapped two Baath party officials in Rastan Wednesday. Authorities last week reported the kidnapping of the attorney general of the central city of Hama, Adnan Bakkour. Two days later, he appeared in a video announcing he had defected from the regime. Activists say he is now safely out of Syria. But authorities insist he was being kept against his will by gunmen and say they are searching for him.Idilbi said there were reports of army defections in Homs Wednesday, saying fierce fighting took place between factions of soldiers. There have been credible reports of scattered, mostly low-level army defections in the past months, although it is difficult to gauge the extent.An amateur video posted online by activists in Rastan showed a group of alleged army defectors in military uniforms saluting crowds calling for the regime's downfall from a balcony.A particularly disturbing video making the rounds on social networking sites Wednesday showed a group of men in military uniform repeatedly shooting a man as he lay bleeding and motionless on the ground. The video, purportedly in Homs, says the men in uniform are pro-Assad thugs, not soldiers.Syria has sealed the country off from foreign journalists and most international observers, insisting that foreigners are meddling, making it difficult to independently verify information coming out of the country. The government's violent crackdown has led to sharp international criticism and sanctions aimed at isolating the regime, including a ban on the import of Syrian oil, a mainstay of the regime.Arab League officials in Egypt had said Secretary General Nabil Elaraby would have presented a plan under which Assad would immediately cease all military operations, release all political prisoners, begin dialogue and announce his intention to form a national unity government and hold pluralistic presidential elections by the end of his term in 2014.The Local Coordination Committees, one of the main Syrian opposition activist groups, said the initiative provided "a good basis that can be built upon" as a way out of the crisis.___AP writer Sarah El-Deeb contributed to this report from Cairo, Egypt.___Zeina Karam can be reached on http://twitter.com/zkaram

Achmed, armed revolt against the Syrian government is treason. But what do you know, you just want to cutoff heads and parade around like little faggyty Muslims.
So why don't you go to Syria and kill these "traitors"? Or are you too scared to leave the sheik's camel's hut in Saudi Arabia? A genocidal faggot and a coward indeed.

only a person with mentall bankruptcy would follow the teachings of a evil lying, morally polluted, raping pedophile, suicidal, narcissist, chauvanist, blackhearted racist lunatic called the prophet mo--ham--head, his teachings are unworthy and a disgrace to humanity

if islam isnt at war with another country then it is at war with it self, if not at war with itself then it is busy beating, stoning, amputating, beheading, hanging, executing, suicide bombing or creating chaos and violence, religion of peace, thats a lie, it is not a religion

the middle east uprising are not about true democracy, democracy is against allah, the quran, the sunnah of mo-ham-head and shari'ah law, to consider anything other is to be a disbeliever and the sentence is death , it is to establish a proper islam to be followed by violent jihad

the west must understand, islam is not a religion, it is a very dangerous political ideology, masking itself as a religion,  with one goal, islamic domination, either through war or through deception, deception of the infidel in anyway to undermind his government and all aspects of society

The only solution for the Middle East is to expel the Arabs from all the regions bordering Israel, and replace them with a Zionist presence...as it seems only the Israelis know how to prosper and make the land blossom.

"killing two people, including a 15-year-old boy, activists said. They said five unidentified corpses, including that of a woman, also were found." I don't understand that type of reporting. Is it only OK to kill men over 18?

Hey Tom, aka Achmed, please define "Syrian people". The last day you were calling for the genocide of Alawites. What about the christian Syrians that support the Alawites? Do you want to kill them too?

Achmed, a history lesson. The golan was lost when your terrorist brethren from Hama ruled Syria. And that time Eli Cohen almost became president of Syria. Without Assad, Syria would have been annexed by Israel now. You are a retarded ignoramus, like all your Saudi buddies.

Pale rider is posting  what he thinks and believe he enjoys the freedom of speech which you do not have in Syria for the time being.
If you do not agree with him debate and prove him wrong why get rid of him by reporting him or is this what they do in Syria when you do not agree with someone.

Having spent time thruout the middle east I can truly say that to be a minority, a minority religion, a woman, or even a minor sect of Islam is one scarry and dangerous life. Chistian populations have dropped from 15% to less then 5% in the last 30 years. The Bahiah faith, Jews, Druze, Dervish, Chaldians, Baptistas (those who follow John the Baptist in Iraq but do not follow the teachings of Christ) Coptic Christians, non muslims of the Sudan, Hindu, Buhdists all have disappeared or been forced to flee to America and other countries.

Well, Tommy, it is a religion, just not one based on peace. Rather it is a religion based on submission to Allah, complete and utter submission of ones own will to a higher power. This is used by the good for good, but does nothing but strengthen the hand of evil. It allows those who wish to use violence and force to use Allah as the excuse and the Koran backs thier position. In fact in many places it commands the use of force, especially against the Jew and unbelievers, in many forms.

"activists and witnesses said."!!!! They have no names no identity, all we know is they are active, and saw something...hmmm....the absolute definition of propaganda....no link to anything real or verifiable!!! Who was responsible for the killing???....Was it provoked, were there paid provocateurs, are there foreign business men being caught with large sums of federal reserve notes in a suitcase and on their person in the immediate area of the killings!!! Were those protesters reported to be  killed, armed with heavy machine guns and tank trap materials!!!, the answers will not be addressed or discussed in any AP propaganda rag designed to foster hate and intolerance, This article is made up to gain  support for another illegal war for greed and influence!!! thanks Zionist's!! love what your doing to the planet!!

They need a right to bear arms, the libs and anti gun lobyiest try to hide from the reason the founders said that that right is so important. It is the right of the people to rise up against a immoral, corrupt or violent government and without some form of armamant it is nearly impossible to do so. Yes our people do not have the wepons that the military has but why is it that most nation/states fear a armed society? Dictators almost always remove that right soon after taking power. 

Dependency is also a key feature of the psychological effect. An unarmed people is a cowering society dependent on its' own government for protection.

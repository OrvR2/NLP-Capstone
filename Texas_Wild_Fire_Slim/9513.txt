As I expected... filters!, February 17, 2010

The filters fit perfectly.  They are slightly different than the original, in that they have an aluminum mesh on one side.  I assume this is to help the filter keep it's shape, and is thus a good idea.  Shipped pretty fast.  I'm not sure what else to say.  They're filters.

I bought these for my Lasko humidifier. Its really dry up here in the mountains. Well, these  Bestairs don't hold together as well as the Laskos. You can only use them once. If you try to wash them a second time thay fall apart!

Fits perfectly, arrived fast, February 17, 2009

Fits my Natural Cascade Super Humidifier perfectly ... but it would have been nice if there were instructions some where on the box.  The filter comes silver on one side but no where does it say how to install it.  Silver side to the air or to the machine?  I couldn't find these replacement filters in any local store ... so I'm very happy to have found them here.

Yep, golf, as hot mic reveals

(Newser) -
                                    Moments before President Obama's big jobs speech, a hot mic caught a private conversation between John Boehner and Joe Biden. Secret strategy? Tense words? Nope, just golf, and a lot of it, as Boehner regales with tales of a recent outing. Also: Boehner greeted Biden by joking, "I'...

(Newser) -
                                    Joe Biden is a car guy. His dad ran multiple dealerships, and the VP has owned some drool–worthy classics in his day. “I still have my 1967 Goodwood-green Corvette, 327, 350-horse, with a rear-axle ratio that really gets up and goes,” he boasts in a new interview...

(Newser) -
                                    It was called a “goodwill” trip—but Georgetown’s voyage to China has resulted in bad blood.

(Newser) -
                                    Harry Reid and John Boehner each made progress in their quest for votes yesterday—but that actually drove them further away from a compromise.

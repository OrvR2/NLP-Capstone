(09-07) 16:03 PDT SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco police have opened an internal investigation into the actions of plainclothes officers who provided backup to Apple Inc. employees who searched a home for a lost iPhone5 prototype, department officials said today. 
 The four plainclothes officers accompanied the Apple investigators who were searching for an iPhone5 prototype that they say was lost in a Mission District restaurant in July. Apple tracked the phone to a Bernal Heights home using GPS technology.
 The two Apple employees met with the resident of the home and searched it after asking permission, a police spokesman said. They did not find the device.
 The four plainclothes officers who accompanied the investigators did not enter the home, Police Chief Greg Suhr said over the weekend.
Sergio Calderon, a 22-year-old man who lives in the home, told SF Weekly that he thought all six people were police officers. If he had known two of them worked for Apple, he told the paper, he would not have let them into his house.
Suhr said San Francisco police often aid private investigators, but that he did not know how the Apple employees had presented themselves. 
Police said today that the four plainclothes officers remain on active duty. Police would not provide any further information into the investigation.

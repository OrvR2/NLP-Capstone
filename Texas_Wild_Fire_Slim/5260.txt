				The studios like Disney, Nickeloden­, etc. are interested in only one thing! Making a buck! They strip these kids of their childhood, extract every cent they can squeeze from them and throw them away when they are too old to play kid parts. Look at Judy Garland. She was given pills to wake her up, pills to make her sleep and the diet of Doctor prescribed pills eventually killed her. The years that are taken from these little profit centers are the years that they are learning who they are and how to get along with other people, but their lives become life in an aquarium with no privacy. The have no other skills than playing cute kids and entertaini­ng teens. When they hit their 20's they are all used up!

				She should sit down and read the news clippings for Lindsey Lohan and chat a course in the opposite direction as it is so easy to believe the people around her telling her she is something special, She has a talent but beyond that she is just another 18 year old that has very little life expierence and should carefully make her choices about her actions as 18 is in no way "GrownUp"

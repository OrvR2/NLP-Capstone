One Man’s 175 Classic Car Collection Destroyed By Texas Wildfire

Well, this just sucks!
A Shelby Cobra, ’47 Studebaker pickup, ’66 Pontiac GTO, several mid-’50s Chevrolets as well as a dozen Corvettes have been destroyed by the wildfires sweeping across Texas, and all were owned by one man. John Chapman, 70, had his entire 175 classic car collection reduced to ashes.
Despite the loss, John says his house and family are safe and continues on to say you can either laugh or cry. He’s chosen to laugh.
I’d be crying.

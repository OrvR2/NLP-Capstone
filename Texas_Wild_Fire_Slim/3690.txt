ABOUT THE TEXAS TIMBER PRICE TRENDS REPORTS









[ Print | 

 ]



Description
Texas Timber Price Trends is a bimonthly publication reporting average prices paid for standing timber, commonly called the stumpage price.  Annual summary reports are also provided.
Its purpose is to provide timely information on timber market conditions to improve decision making and foster fair transactions that benefit both buyer and seller and encourage conservation of the timber resource.
Average stumpage prices published in this report are calculated from actual timber sales as reported by more than 60 cooperators active in the East Texas timber market. Values are weighted by volume sold to filter out the effect that size of sale has on price paid. Thus, the average price reported is the average price paid per unit of wood, NOT per average timber sale.
The tables show average reported prices for various pine and hardwood products for time period indicated. (Each table represents only a portion of Texas Timber Price Trends.)

Guest list at Toronto fest shrinks: regrets from Hopkins, WilliamsBy The Canadian Press | The Canadian Press – 20 hours ago

TORONTO - With George Clooney and Brad Pitt in town, there's hardly a celebrity shortage on the streets of Canada's most populous city this weekend, yet many stars seem to be pulling a disappearing act at the Toronto International Film Festival.A Saturday morning news conference set to feature the high-wattage likes of Robert De Niro, Jason Statham and Clive Owen was scrapped by festival organizers "due to unforeseen scheduling circumstances." A publicist said all three were still expected to walk the red carpet later in the day.That cancellation came after regrets from Anthony Hopkins (who has a viral infection and can't travel to Toronto to promote his movie "360") and "Take This Waltz" star Michelle Williams (who bowed out because she's busy working on a new film).There was also word late Friday that Michael Fassbender won't be able to make a his scheduled weekend appearances to promote the David Cronenberg film "A Dangerous Method."Other stars have only made fleeting appearances in Toronto.White-hot actress Mia Wasikowska paid a whirlwind visit to the city Thursday night to screen her Gus Van Sant film "Restless."A change in the shooting schedule for her latest film meant she had to cancel a round of interviews. She was also unable to remain at the fest to promote another of her movies, "Albert Nobbs," a buzzed about period piece co-starring Glenn Close.Other stars have seemingly been bedevilled by travel plans and illness: "Machine Gun Preacher" star Gerard Butler curtailed interviews after he encountered delays and a publicist said Tilda Swinton, in town for "Let's Talk About Kevin" cut down her media schedule because she was feeling under the weather.The Toronto International Film Festival runs until Sept. 18.

I work as a film and TV producer and I can tell you that the haters on here who say TIFF is unimportant are just very jealous or very dumb and ignorant because TIFF is one of the most highly respected film festivals in the industry all around the world.

Only in Toronto would "who's NOT coming" make news.  The TIFF worshippers don't realize that no one else on earth cares one iota about their so-called "international" movie show.  No one in Australia, UK, Europe, or the US has even heard about TIFF.  It reminds me of the old joke: "Toronto" is an old Mohawk word meaning "I wish I were New York but I'm not."

Why would any American celebrity or commoner, want to come to Canada and spend much time here.  Canadians talk SHIT on them and they aren't as stupid as you think they are..only real reason Canadians make a big deal out the Stars is because you want something from them!! Bigots and hypocrites, a whole fuckin country of you! Such a joy to be around.

Sl1955ringo:  Are you obsessing about TIFF or what?! Holy smoke! Time to log off and grab a sandwich. You must have low blood sugar.

most of the "stars" are mentally vacant, morally bankrupt, self-absorbed, narcissistic, vulgar losers you wouldn't want in your house.  Why are we so bedazzled by the ability to act....great...you can pretend to be someone else....bravo....bravo

What a drag it must be to go to film festival after film festival, pretending you care about any other film but the one you're in.   Same boring interviews, same  boring questions, and tons of lame people who have such meaningless lives that they have to line up for hours to catch a glimpse of you walking into a building...really...how sad.

"illness" could be caused by nerves from travelling around 9/11.  I don't begrudge anyone wanting to stay home because of that - safety first.  However, honesty goes a long way as well...

So who is the better human being, handsome George Clooney or not so "handsome"  Mother Theresa?

I care. Why?   Because I find it of some personal and intellectual value in meeting and engaging in discussion with persons who have reached the top in their chosen professions.  Often these persons have and will share their insights off topic but in an engaging way.  George was particularly illuminating in our related discussions, just last night, about what he feels is an unsettling and increasing move toward the right by many democratic governments ... 

At the other end of the spectrum I enjoy reading these blogs just to remind myself how low some people can go ... both in their morals and in their intellectual beliefs.

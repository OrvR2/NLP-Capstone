Video: Chargers lose kicker on first play of the season By      Doug Farrar


In 2010, the San Diego Chargers had the worst special teams of the last decade, according to Football Outsiders' metrics. They had five of the nine blocked punts last season, and lost at least two games directly as a result of their punt-blocking and kick coverage units. It looked like more of the same in the very first play of San Diego's season opener against the Minnesota Vikings, when Minnesota receiver Percy Harvin(notes) ran back the opening kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown.
Not only did the Chargers have to relive some of the things that kept them out of the 2010 postseason despite leading the league in offense and defense per certain metrics, but they lost kicker Nate Kaeding(notes) — possibly for the year in what could be the quickest end to a season ever, and most definitely for a kicker — with what has been diagnosed as a torn ACL in his left knee. Kaeding was injured while attempting to make a tackle on the opening-kickoff return. Chargers head coach Norv Turner confirmed on Monday morning that Kaeding will be out for the season, and the team is lining up kickers to audition.

However, if that doesn't work out, the Chargers did discover at least one guy on their roster capable of popping a 40-yard field goal when needed — punter Mike Scifres(notes) became the default kicker after Kaeding's injury and boomed this three-pointer in the fourth quarter of a game the Chargers managed to win, 24-17.

It wasn't the first time Scifres had been pressed into kicking duty — at Western Illinois years ago, he nailed a 56-yard last-second field goal to beat Northern Iowa.
"It was my sophomore year in college, and we were tied with seven seconds left," Scifres told USA Today. "If we beat Northern Iowa, we'd win the conference, and if we lost, we would have gotten the second seed in our conference.
"I was able to make it with no time left. But that was another situation where I hadn't kicked a field goal with the team or in practice, and if I would have missed, we still would've gone into overtime and still had a chance. So I went out there and took a swing at it."
Scifres, who signed a new five-year, $18 million extension on Sept. 7, also made all three of his extra-point attempts, and put two of his four kickoffs in the end zone — admittedly, not a tough task these days, with the kickoffs moved up to the 35-yard line.
Still and all, an impressive sub performance by Scifres, who also boomed three punts for 127 yards. It was the first time in a long time that the Chargers have had a special teams standout of any type.

0 users disliked this comment G 17 minutes ago Report Abuse I don't like to see anyone get injured, but maybe it's time to get these guys into shape. Curtail their off the field activities such as no drinking, no partying, and more practice. And base their pay upon their performance, just like the rest of the world is judged. Seems to me this one change would bring down the cost of tickets, as a lot of the players would be paying the owners. Just food for thought.

I hope this improves soon before a career ending injury   occurs

0 users disliked this comment Bassguitarbubba 2 hours ago Report Abuse A lot of posts are slamming Kaeding for losing some key games.   The Chargers have always been a good second half team.   Unfortunately, a team cannot win the Super Bowl only playing well for half the game.   They need to play well the entire game.   The problems lie deeper than Kaeding.

Shooting the breeze with other fans on Sunday, one guy had the Chargers for his pre season SB AFC pick. Sorry, even in a down season for the Steelers, the Patriots, Jets, Ravens this season will be there before the Chargers.

6 users disliked this comment Andrew G 3 hours ago Report Abuse As a Chargers fan I am STOKED that Nate Kaeding is injured and out for the season!!! Good Riddance! It's his fault the chargers never got far in the play-offs and HIS fault that I don't have season tickets to the Chargers anymore because he couldn't kick a field goal to save his life in the 2009 playoff game against the Jets. That was our year and Kaeding blew it for the entire Chargers franchise. Hopefully Kaeding never kicks another football or ball of any kind for the rest of his life. Better yet send him to the Raiders he belongs over there with the rest of the morons

2 users disliked this comment cc mustang88 3 hours ago Report Abuse San Diego has a football team? Really? Who'd a thunk it!

Actually...anyone who thinks he isn't torn up about not getting to collect his paycheck by EARNING it, has no concept of the drive athletes have to compete. Be they professional or amateur. 

As for those who care to heap the lousy season San Diego had last year in the playoffs onto his back...last time I checked...there were a whole hell of a lot of other guys on the field as well...who equally should share in the blame. Anytime San Diego makes the post season...(in ANY sport)...fans should be thrilled...and surprised. Ownership of both the baseball and football teams aren't serious about success...they just like the tax write-offs!

0 users disliked this comment David 4 hours ago Report Abuse I'm a Chargers fan and I'm not happy as many other Chargers are... he's part of the team and you have to support the whole team. Plus, I've always wanted for him to redeem himself, no matter how badly he's done before, he's a human being and I don't know... maybe it's just me, but I always want the best to happen to people, specially after going thru some rough times.

2 users disliked this comment Doug K 5 hours ago Report Abuse Thank you jeebus, that guy was a splinter in our foot. He has no leg so cant kick balls into the end zone so our under-talented coverage has to always make a tackle. Oh yeah, hes easily lost like 4 playoff games for us. He's the kickers version of Romo in the playoffs.

April's Sweet Treats offers special-order treats and goodies
By Cindy V. Culp
A relatively new bakery in Bosqueville is hoping a recent promotion will bring in a steady stream of customers.
April’s Sweet Treats was the featured business on a daily deal website called Living Social last week. Owner April Avila said she is hoping the exposure will help steer customers to her storefront, 6417 N. 19th Street. Although it likely gets some benefit from being located just down the road from the La Fiesta restaurant in Bosqueville, the bakery is a little off the beaten path.
The bakery, which opened in March, does quite a bit of special-order business, such as cakes for weddings or baby showers. But Avila also cooks up a variety of creations to sell to walk-in customers.
Last week, the offerings included “inside out smores,” chocolate and nut-encrusted marshmallows on a stick and cupcakes.
This week, the bakery is selling pineapple upside down cake ($3 per slice), lemon bundt cake ($2 per slice) and a variety of cookies ($1 to $1.50 each.)
A weekly rundown of items can be found on the bakery’s Facebook page. The store’s phone number is 224-1094. Hours are 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, with a lunch break from 11:15 a.m. to 1:15 p.m.

I tasted one of April's wedding cakes at a friend's reception. It was delicious. Sooo moist & beautiful. I will use her & have already recommended her bakery to many of my friends.

In My Opinion ...




Should Baylor sue if A&M leaves the Big 12?

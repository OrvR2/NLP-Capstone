Keira Knightley risks rankling Toronto hockey fans with Habs jerseyBy Cassandra Szklarski, The Canadian Press | The Canadian Press – Sat, 10 Sep, 2011 1:32 PM EDT

TORONTO - Keira Knightley risked rankling a Toronto audience by striding into a film festival press conference with a Montreal Canadiens jersey slung across her shoulders.The British movie star says she did so at the bidding of her "Dangerous Method" co-star Viggo Mortensen, who is a big Habs fan.Mortensen says he gave his co-star a "thorough coaching" on the politics of Canadian hockey before coming out. He proudly displayed a Habs jersey bearing the name Lafleur on the back, as well as a Scott Gomez sweater.Knightley says they thought it would get the ire of their Toronto-bred director, David Cronenberg, and it did.Cronenberg called the stunt "perverse" and expressed mock dismay that it didn't seem to bother Knightley.Knightley says she actually has no idea who hockey hero Guy Lafleur is, but says she expects her career to take off in Montreal after the appearance."Actually, I have to admit I have no idea what the jersey is.... He told me it would wind David up so we decided it would be a good idea," Knightley said Saturday, gesturing to Mortensen who sat beside her."Something about a blond demon, I don't know what that means.""I'm going to be huge in Montreal after this."The Toronto International Film Festival runs through Sept. 18.

Who cares the Maple Laughs, they're SUCK, and when you're SUCK everyone take a run at you.  Expect the Maple Last to begin strong and missing the playoffs again by a few points.

If they make a Lafleur movie, Viggo should star in it.  At first, I thought that Lafleur got some plastic surgery done.  I could care less about which team wins the cup with star players moving around.    It was nice to see a guy like Lanny McDonald win a cup.

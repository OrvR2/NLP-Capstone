FACT CHECK: Perry, Romney twist records in debateBy CALVIN WOODWARD - Associated Press,JIM KUHNHENN - Associated Press | AP – 2 hrs 12 mins ago

WASHINGTON (AP) — When Mitt Romney and Rick Perry thumped their chests over their job-creation records as governor during the Republican presidential debate Wednesday night, they left the bad parts out.Yes, employment has grown by more than 1 million since Perry took office in Texas. But a lot of those jobs are not well paid.True, unemployment dropped to 4.7 percent when Romney was Massachusetts governor. But the state's employment growth was among the nation's worst.A look at some of the claims in the debate, and how they compare with the facts:PERRY: "Ninety-five percent of all the jobs that we've created have been above minimum wage."THE FACTS: To support the claim, the Perry campaign provided federal statistics for December 2010 showing only 5.3 percent of all jobs in Texas pay the minimum wage.But those figures represent all workers, not just the new jobs, for which data are unavailable. And that does not account for low-wage jobs that may be barely above the minimum wage. According to the Texas Workforce Commission, 51 percent of all Texas workers make less than $33,000 a year. Only 30 percent make more than $50,000 a year. Nationally, Texas ranked 34th in median household income from 2007 to 2009.About 9.5 percent of Texas hourly workers, excluding those who are paid salaries, earn the minimum wage or less, tying Mississippi for the highest percentage in the nation.___ROMNEY: "At the end of four years, we had our unemployment rate down to 4.7 percent. That's a record I think the president would like to see. As a matter of fact, we created more jobs in Massachusetts than this president has created in the entire country."THE FACTS: To be sure, 4.7 percent unemployment would be a welcome figure nationally. But Romney started from a much better position than President Barack Obama did. Unemployment was only 5.6 percent when Romney took office in 2003, meaning it came down by less than 1 percentage point when he left office in 2007. Obama inherited a national unemployment rate of 7.8 percent.___PERRY: "Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did, Mitt."ROMNEY: "Well, as a matter of fact, George Bush and his predecessor created jobs at a faster rate than you did, governor."PERRY: "That's not correct."ROMNEY: "Yes, that is correct."THE FACTS: Romney was correct.Romney accurately stated that George W. Bush — even without his predecessor — saw jobs grow at a faster rate during his 1994-2000 years as governor than Perry has during his 11 years governing Texas. Employment grew by about 1.32 million during Bush's six years in office. Employment during Perry's years has grown about 1.2 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.As for Perry's claim about Romney's record and that of Dukakis, he was at least in the ballpark.Democratic Gov. Dukakis saw Massachusetts employment grow by 500,000 jobs during his two divided terms, 1975 to 1979, and 1983 to 1991, a rate of more than 41,000 jobs a year.Romney, governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, saw employment grow from 3.23 million to 3.29 million, growth of about 60,000 jobs, or a rate of 15,000 a year. That means Dukakis' job growth rate was nearly three times Romney's.___MICHELE BACHMANN: "Obamacare is killing jobs. We know that from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, but I know it firsthand from speaking to people. We see it this summer. There are 47 percent of African-American youth that are currently without jobs, 36 percent of Hispanic youth."THE FACTS: The health care law that Obama pushed and Congress passed last year has long been labeled a job killer by Republicans, who often cite a Congressional Budget Office analysis to buttress their claims. But the CBO at no point said the law would result in job losses. Instead it made the more nuanced assertion that fewer people would chose to work."The legislation, on net, will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount — roughly half a percent — primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply," the CBO said in an analysis. That's not job-killing, that's workers choosing not to work because of easier access to health care. The budget office said some people might decide to retire earlier because it would be easier to get health care, instead of waiting until they become eligible for Medicare at age 65.The Minnesota congresswoman also states the percentages of unemployment among minority youth. But there is no evidence that the health care law is responsible for that level of unemployment. In fact, the health care law is still largely unimplemented, with some of its key provisions not taking effect until 2014.___PERRY: On global warming, "The science is not settled on this. The idea that we would put Americans' economy at jeopardy based on scientific theory that's not settled yet, to me, is just, is nonsense. ... Find out what the science truly is before you start putting the American economy in jeopardy."THE FACTS: The scientific consensus on climate change is about as settled as any major scientific issue can be. Perry's opinion runs counter to the view of an overwhelming majority of scientists that pollution released from the burning of fossil fuels is heating up the planet. The National Academy of Sciences, in an investigation requested by Congress, concluded last year: "Climate change is occurring, is very likely caused primarily by human activities, and poses significant risks to humans and the environment."___BACHMANN: "It's wrong for government, whether it's state or federal government, to impose on parents what they must do to inoculate their children."THE FACTS: She was correct that Perry supported mandatory immunization of girls to reduce future risks of cervical cancer, although the measure was blocked by Texas lawmakers and parents would have had some ability to file a conscientious objection to the requirement. Perry signed an executive order in 2007 directing his state health department to make the human papillomavirus vaccine available to "mandate the age-appropriate vaccination of all female children" before they enter sixth grade. Texas would have been the first state to require the immunizations.___PERRY: "What I find compelling is what we've done in the state of Texas, using our ability to regulate our clean air. We cleaned up our air in the state of Texas, more than any other state in the nation during the decade." He specifically mentioned successes in reducing nitrous oxide emissions by 58 percent and ozone levels by 27 percent.THE FACTS: Texas has reduced emissions as Perry described, but most of those reductions were required under the federal Clean Air Act. However, the Environmental Protection Agency recently rescinded the state's authority to grant some air pollution permits because the state did not comply with federal regulations. Texas, home to America's oil and gas industry, still emits more carbon dioxide — the chief greenhouse gas — than any other state in the country, according to government data. Several metropolitan areas in Texas still violate health-based limits for smog, and the county that is home to Houston is one of the biggest emitters of hazardous air pollution in the country. The Texas Legislature also passed, and Perry signed, a law that will delay enforcing stiffer clean air regulations by two years.___Associated Press writers Chris Tomlinson in Austin, Texas; Steve Peoples in Exeter, N.H.; Dina Cappiello in Washington; and Brian Bakst in St. Paul, Minn., contributed to this report.EDITOR'S NOTE _ An occasional look at claims by public officials and how well they adhere to the facts.

It relly doesn't matter which party the President comes out of, if the Republicans and Democrats in congress cannot work together, we will have the same old crap till we get term limits and are able to throw the bums out. So long as we have Politicians in both parties that put SPECIAL INTRESTS and themselves ahead of everything else, we the people are going to be the losers !!!

Newt seemed to take the night but isn't electable, the wisdom is Romney is the one best prepared to handle the democrats spin and demogogry but I have a personal bias against him and Perry has too many statements that will come back to haunt him. With a congress that puts their own welfare ahead of the country's, maybe we would be better off to leave Obama where he is and give the republicans both houses. The stalemate could possibly stop all of them and maybe the economy would be worked out by the private sector. Political reality precludes ever having moderation because any cause requires an enemy to hold up to your followers

Fact Check is just a bunch of liars, expecially about global warming. I was reading where a few years back Exxon hired some expert researchers to go out there and find out the facts on global warming. What they found out was that global warming was just a hoax made up by scientists, most of which were liberals who just wanted to destroy the American economy. Turns out there were no facts at all behind global warming, just a bunch of liberal lies and as usual the lamestream media just keeps repeating them. Perry has the facts, Fact Check should be called Liberal Lie Check.

Another pissy liberal article. I grew up in  Texas. Life was great and full of opportunities. It still is. Don't compare Texas and Mississippi. That's like comparing Disneyland to the play area at McDonalds. Also, $33,000 for Texas illegals is a hell of a lot of money, unless they sell drugs. And you can't make people work if they don't want to, nor can you make an employer hire someone with no skill, or english ability. And if you're covered in tattoos, ear plugs and nose rings; or refuse to cut your hair, wear shoes and quit sagging; or if you act and talk like a punk... I wouldn't hire you. I don't care what race you are. That's a bad example, but what about the fact that a chunk of Texas unemployment is due to a large number involved in home based business. Texas was a great place to live. Anyway, I liked many of Perry's views, especially on the death penalty and punishing crimminals.  He sounds strong and maybe a bit aggressive but I don't know much other than what I heard him say.Now residing in Utah, I watched Huntsman do an excellent job as Gov.. On some issues, I think he is a little too nice, like dealing with crimminals and illegals*. He did a great job as Chinese Ambassador too. I also saw Romney do a great job on the Best Run Olympics ever. He then went on to be Gov. of Mass. where the libs fought him tooth and nail. No wonder some of his policies weren't as successful as they could have been. Same thing happened to Bush. Both of them are excellent business men. I would trust either one to better manage the economy than Obama. Obama's idea of making money is to print more. He then fritters it away on worthless ideas that stimulate nothing. I've also liked comments by Cain but I don't know much about him. They seemed to ignore him and some of the other candidates. Typical! I wish all the candidates had to answer the same questions.*We need to be tougher on companies that hire illegals, spanish or otherwise. No amnesty, and no benefits for illegals. Illegals should have their valuables confiscated to pay for sending them home. Make it more costly and painful to come here illegally, and they will stop. Come in legally and you deserve to be here and pay taxes. I want my country to be full of proud Americans regardless of faith or ethnicity. I'm Norwegian, Italian and English but I fly Old Glory. I'm tired of people coming here to make money and escape the hardships of their own countries, only to #$%$ and moan and bad mouth America. Go home! Leave your gang crap at home too. That said, some of my best friends are spanish.

Leftie Lame Stream Media operate a lame debate and then reports on winners\losers? Hahahaha......did this forum ever take place in 2008? No. Lame Stream Media will #$%$ about one million jobs created in Texas because the don't pay what LSM thinks they should pay. Boohoo. For those of you unemployed, would you take one of those jobs or are you content with your unemployment? As far as the 'scientists' on this board - #$%$ you do not have a consensus, never have had a consensus and it is true that science changes almost daily. SS is a ponzi scheme and somebody running for office has finally got enough balls to say out loud what we all talk about. That is refreshing. NOBAMA 2012 because America cannot afford four more.

I strongly disagree with Ron Paul on many levels, but I have an immense amount of respect for the man for being the only Republican I've seen in a very long time who says what he means and genuinely believes in doing the right thing for America. That's more than you can say about most Democrats, too. He stands out so obviously from these other clowns, yet he still lacks real support from the voters (I know he is getting more popular and a lot of young people and libertarians like him, but he is not nearly electable yet). I can't believe Republican voters could want more of the same rhetoric, fear-mongering, cronyism and greed from their candidates.

I don't understand why anyone would want to be a scientist. They spend their entire lives trying to understand the world we live in, and then people like Rick Perry stomp on their life's work because they think they know better, when they probably haven't spent a fraction of the time working in the field. It's been happening this way for centuries. Ever since Galileo, it's been happening.

Please stop falling for the right/left paradigm these politicians (who’ve been bought and paid for by the six globalist mega-banks) use to keep us all divided and under control.
Ron Paul is running under the Republican banner for no other reason than, if you’re not under one of the two fictitious parties (Republican/Democrat), you can’t be elected; he could just as easily run under the Democrat banner making no difference.
If you’re a Democrat, go out today and register Republican so you can vote in the primaries to get Mr. Paul in.
If you’re currently registered independent (as I was), go now and do the same.
It has nothing to do with agreeing with Republicans or not.  There is NO DIFFERENCE between Republicans and Democrats!!  It’s an illusion meant to control.  We must get rid of this ‘two party’ dictatorships.  Mr. Paul doesn’t represent the entity Bush, Obama and Perry do.  He represents us!!
It’s time to stop the left/right American division, truly come together and send these globalist back to where they spawn from.

Perry is a religous zealot that does not believe in science.  Conservative Republicans never left medieval times when the earth was flat, the earth was the center of the universe and 6000 years old, and people were instantaneously made by God and rode dinosaurs around the Garden of eden.  How can such moronic ideas exist in the 21st century?

By Robert Frank of the Wall Street Journal
The stakes for high-net-worth dogs continue to rise.
First, there was the $1.5 million mastiff. Then the “troubled” millionaire maltese. And now comes the Toy Terrier.
Thieves in Italy last month snuck into the Genoa hotel room of Russian chemicals tycoon Stanislav Rybchinsky and took the family’s Russian Toy Terrier, named Johnny.
Dog-nappings among the rich are not uncommon, of course. But the family’s efforts to get Johnny back have been especially aggressive.  They’ve contacted the Italian police and have urged Russian diplomats to apply pressure on the Italian authorities. They also alerted more than 100 vets around Genoa to stay on the look out for Johnny.
Mr. Rybchinsky demanded that the entire hotel staff take a lie detector test, but the hotel refused.
Best of all, they’ve offered a reward of $15,000 to anyone who recovers him.
“We were very upset,” Mr. Rybchinsky’s daughter, Yana, said in an interview with the Telegraph. “For my mother, he was like a member of the family who was always kind and never barked at anyone.”

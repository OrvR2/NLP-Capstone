A New No. 1 on the Forbes China Rich ListBy Russell Flannery | Forbes – 8 hrs ago




Related ContentA New No. 1 on the Forbes China Rich List

China’s economic growth may be poised to ease, but the country that has been one of the fast-growing sources of new rich in recent years continues to generate more of the same, according to the newest edition of the Forbes China Rich List.
The number of billionaires among China’s richest 400 people increased to  a record 146 from 128 a year earlier, according to the annual survey released today by Forbes Asia.
 
 
The total wealth of the richest 400 people on the mainland is US$459 billion, an increase of 8% from $423.2 billion before, but only 4% in local currency terms. That is less than the 10% increase in China’s GDP last year and way below the 31% rise in total wealth a year earlier when measured in local currency.  Slowing growth in China’s wealth is a warning sign for global luxury good suppliers that have viewed its market as the El Dorado of the East.
One source of downward pressure on the country’s fortunes: Shanghai’s A-share index has lost about 11% since our 2010 list was published. Roughly half of the 400 members of this year’s list had a lower wealth figure than last year.  Some 94 members of the 2010 didn’t return this year, 17 of which came from a real estate industry that has been hurt by government credit tightening amid high inflation.
Liang Wengen, 54, chairman of construction equipment manufacturer, Sany Heavy Industry, is the richest person in China with a net worth of $9.3 billion, moving up from third place last year when he was worth $5.9 billion.  A big jump in its shares has enabled a record seven executives from the company to make our list of China’s 400. Besides Liang, the three to make the billionaire ranks were Tang Xiuguo with wealth of $1.43 billion, Mao Zhongwu at $1.29 billion and Xiang Wenbo, $1.29 billion.    Sany’s rise as a global capital equipment maker underscores the challenges faced by older players such as Caterpillar and Deere.
Robin Li, co-founder of search engine Baidu, ranks a close second on this year’s list with a net worth of $9.2 billion, up from $7.2 billion a year ago. Li ranked as the no.1 among billionaires from China on our 2011 Forbes Billionaires List published in March and would have had a shot at retaining that status except for a plunge in Baidu’s shares in mid-August when we priced this year’s list. 
Among other U.S.-listed Internet entrepreneurs to make the list:  Charles Zhang of Soho,  William Ding of Netease, Zhou Hongyi of Qihoo and Joe Chen of Renren.

Austin Texas Fire Chief Vacations as Austin Area Burns
3 comments






Austin Texas Fire Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr chose to remain on her golf vacation in Colorado as deadly wildfires burned near her city. Statesman.com reports “As fires tore through hundreds of Central Texas homes, Austin officials dispatched nearly 200 of their firefighters to help across the region and issued an urgent request Sunday for 25 off-duty firefighters to report to work.
But Austin Fire Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr stayed in Colorado for a Labor Day weekend golfing trip, leaving subordinates largely in charge of her department’s response while keeping in touch by cellphone and email.”
This is an outrage. At the same time thousands of Texans were repeating the call for help from retired and off duty firefighters on Twitter and Facebook the fire chief of the largest city in the region teed it up. If morale in Austin was not low before it is now. As a former firefighter I cannot understand this line of thinking. Obviously fighting fire is not her top priority.

10 Tanker to Texas
No comments






10 Tanker, the converted commercial DC-10 air tanker has been called to assist the state of Texas in suppressing the devastating wildfires plaguing the state. 10 Tanker delivers a 12,000 gallon payload of retardant, gel or water and can deliver the load in one drop or a continuous line, whichever best compliments ground units.
The typical air tanker carries a load of 2,000 gallons and most helicopters can deliver loads in the hundreds of gallons. The airship was contracted by the state of California in the last decade until budget considerations ended the relationship. 10 Tanker is still called to fires in California on an on-call basis where it is called Tanker 910. The air tanker has seen action in Australia and Canada. If Texas residents see this airship overhead they can know the state has called in the premiere firefighting tool in the nation.
Here is how she looks in action!

Bastrop Texas Wildfire
19 comments






The Bastrop County Complex Fire has consumed more than 25,000 acres and destroyed an estimated 476 homes or structures since yesterday, Reuters reports.
The Geomac imagery below shows how tenuous the situation is in and around Bastrop. The red circles in the image represent actively burning fire. Orange represents fire burned over the past 12 hours. You can see active burning up to Lake Bastrop.  The fire is burning on all fronts with no obvious anchor point. It is easy to see from the Geomac imagery that the Bastrop Fire has no containment.
Bastrop has a population of over 5,000. Fox News has reported 250 firefighters are working the fire as crews are stretched around the state. Simple math tells us there are not enough fire crews to protect all the structures in Bastrop. This fire will burn as long as there is wind to push it. 
Civilians need to heed evacuation orders. 
Note too the fire burning West of Bastrop threatening the town of Wyldwood.

Here is a dramatic video of the fire burning over Highway 21 east of Bastrop. This is the definition of a monster fire.

Small Aircraft Crash Ignites the ‘Canyon Fire’
2 comments






Update: 16:15 hours 9/5 Via Wildlandfire.com A dozen homes, 15 outbuildings and several vehicles have been destroyed by the Canyon Fire. Fire estimated at around 9,000 acres. Aircraft being diverted to a new fire in L.A. County.
Update: 07:00 9/5 Canyon Fire is at 3,500 acres with 0% containment. Heading to ridgetops among the local wind farms on the south flank. Structure protection is key today as aircraft support these efforts and drop on flanks. This is a traditionally high wind environment but the wind direction favors burning towards the desert. For more.
Update: 18:45 hours good news and bad news. The good news is this is a Cal Fire/Kern County incident which means they will throw their entire force of resources at it. The bad, “aircraft are going defensive“, not direct and are dropping loads in and around structures.
TehachapiNews.com reports “One death (updated to two deaths) related to the crash of a small plane in the mountains southeast of the City of Tehachapi has been confirmed.”

The officers were parked on the side of Highway 1 in Malibu when a drunk hit their vehicle vaulting it over the small cliff and into the rocks above the surf.  Both officers suffered  non life threatening injuries. Good video with a glimpse of the techniques employed by fire and rescue personnel including one of the officers being airlifted off the beach.

‘Motor Fire’ Hitting on all Cylinders
No comments






There could not be a less hospitable spot for a major wildfire than the Merced River Canyon near Yosemite National Park. In July and August of 2008 the Telegraph Fire burned over 50,000 acres and claimed dozens of homes in and around Mariposa just down canyon from where the Motor Fire is raging.
The Motor Fire has burned 3,000 acres in two days and firefighters are still in the early stages of formulating a plan of attack. Initial reports had the fire burning on both sides of Highway 140 and the Merced River which would give the fire two distinct heads and directions. Maps are showing the fire burning mostly on the north side of the river and highway. The Telegraph Fire burned on both sides of the canyon as it raced upstream towards Yosemite which complicated suppression activity. Firefighters could not use the massive Merced River as an anchor. 
Motor Fire and Proximity to Yosemite Nat Park
The GeoMac image above highlights the perimeters of recent fire activity including the Telegraph to the west and the Grouse and Big Meadow fires to the east. The Big Meadow and Grouse burns will act as a pair of defensive tackles blunting (somewhat) the eastern progression of the Motor Fire. There is no recent fire history north of the Motor so a run to Highway 120 is entirely possible. 
A look at the area of responsibility shows this will be a Forest Service show with Cal Fire responsible for only a couple of strips of land and property along the river and highway. Cal Fire was responsible for suppressing the Telegraph Fire and at one point had 4,500 firefighters, 30 or more fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, 61 fire crews and 101 fire engines on scene. It will be interesting to see how many resources the Forest Service puts in use.

Cal Fire To Impose $150 Fee Per Inhabitable Structure in Response Zones
1 comment






Cal Fire, California’s elite wildland firefighting force is set to charge homeowners within Cal Fire’s area of responsibility $145 per inhabitable structure. It’s being called a “fire prevention fee” and the bill will create a Responsibility Area Fire Prevention Fund.
The crux of the issue is hardly arguable.
AB 29 Chapter 1.5
(c)  The costs of fire prevention activities aimed at reducing the effects
of structures in state responsibility areas should be borne by the owners of
these structures.
(d)  Individual owners of structures within state responsibility areas receive
a disproportionately larger benefit from fire prevention activities than that
realized by the state’s citizens generally.
(e)  It is the intent of the Legislature that the economic burden of fire
prevention activities that are associated with structures in state responsibility
areas shall be equitably distributed among the citizens of the state who
generally benefit from those activities and those owners of structures in the
state responsibility areas who receive a specific benefit other than that
general benefit.
 Assembly Bill No. 29 dictates the fund will feed the following: 
Moneys in the fund shall be used only for the following fire prevention
activities, which shall benefit owners of structures within the state
responsibility areas who are required to pay the annual fire prevention fee
pursuant to this chapter:
–  Local assistance grants.
– Grants to Fire Safe Councils, the California Conservation Corps, or
certified local conservation corps for fire prevention projects and activities
in the state responsibility areas.
– Grants to a qualified nonprofit organization with a demonstrated
ability to satisfactorily plan, implement, and complete a  fire prevention
project applicable to the state responsibility areas.
– Inspections by the department for compliance with defensible space
requirements around structures in state responsibility areas
– Public education to reduce fire risk in the state responsibility areas.
– Fire severity and fire hazard mapping by the department in the state
responsibility areas.
– Other  fire prevention projects in the state responsibility areas,
authorized by the board.
– The board shall establish a local assistance grant program for fire
prevention activities designed to benefit structures within state responsibility
areas, including public education, that are provided by counties and other
local agencies, including special districts, with state responsibility areas
within their jurisdictions.

Fire Monks, A Story of Fire, Bravery and Abandonment
4 comments






When fire swept down canyon and into the grounds of their monastery a group of five Buddhist Monks were waiting. None of them had direct fire ground experience but what they possessed was a lifetime of physical and mental training in their discipline that helped prepare them for what they faced. 
Author Colleen Morton Busch spent two years preparing this comprehensive documentation of their story. She accurately describes the events leading to the five being left alone to save their monastery through personal interviews and U.S. Forest Service fire reports. In addition Colleen utilized the Freedom Of Information Act to secure notes by fire commanders.
The story of Tassajara Zen Center and the plight of the monks within during the Basin Complex Fire in 2008 was a story I personally followed and wrote about here in real time as events unfolded. I made my opinions known in 2008 and those opinions are reflected in ‘Fire Monks’.
I recommend Fire Monks because it is a story like no other. When else have you read a story where resident guardians of an historic cultural learning center were abandoned to fend for themselves as fire commanders withheld the aid of 16 available helicopters, numerous fixed wing aircraft, dozens of structure protection fire engines, dozens of fire crews and hundreds of firefighters? 
Buy Fire Monks and read the story.

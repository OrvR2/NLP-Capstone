Giant Texas wildfire destroys 700 homes



 
Advertisement BASTROP, Texas, Sept. 7 (UPI) -- The most devastating wildfire in Texas history, destroying some 700 homes, grew so big, the U.S. Forest Service took charge Wednesday, officials said.The Bastrop, Texas, fire near Austin -- one of nearly 200 fires that erupted across the state in the past week -- raged out of control for a fourth day, consuming more than 54 square miles and forcing more than 7,000 people to evacuate.It killed at least two people, Bastrop County Sheriff Terry Pickering said Tuesday, raising the statewide death toll to at least four. He offered no details about the deaths.The earlier deaths were a mother and her 18-month-old daughter, killed Sunday near Gladewater, east of Dallas, when they couldn't escape their mobile home in a fast-moving fire that destroyed the mobile home and five other homes within minutes.Reduced winds of 5 mph to 10 mph that began Tuesday were expected to last through Saturday, giving an estimated 1,200 firefighters from more than a dozen states a chance to get closer to the fire and dig fire lines with 27 bulldozers and by hand, and to cut brush and trees in the hope of containing the inferno, Forest Service spokesman Mike Ferris told USA Today.Wind and heat conditions were previously so severe firefighters in the drought-parched terrain couldn't mount a land attack, Texas Forest Service officials said before handing over the firefighting coordination to the U.S. Forest Service, whose Smokey Bear mascot seeks to educate the public about preventing forest fires.Firefighters used heavy tanker planes and "helitanker" helicopters to dump thousands of gallons on the stubborn blaze.Bastrop school district officials said classes would be canceled for the rest of the week.White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday the Obama administration had approved seven federal grants at the request of Texas Gov. Rick Perry -- who stopped campaigning for the GOP presidential nomination Monday to deal with the raging wildfires, but was to return to the trail Wednesday when the Republican hopefuls gather in Southern California for another nationally televised debate."We will continue to work closely with the state and local emergency management officials as their efforts to contain these fires continue," Carney said.Major homeowners' insurance companies, including the Farmers Insurance Group, State Farm Insurance and Allstate, declared the Texas fires a catastrophe and sent specialized claims workers and equipment to help customers through the process.It was too soon to determine the total amount of insured property losses, but they will be the worst in state history, Insurance Council of Texas spokesman Mark Hanna told the Austin American-Statesman.The previous record, set in 2009, was more than $100 million."This weekend, we just surpassed it by a long shot," Hanna said. "Unfortunately, conditions are right in the entire state for this to continue."The cause of the Bastrop fire was under investigation. There were indications it started in a residential subdivision.

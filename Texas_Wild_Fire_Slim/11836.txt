BASTROP, Texas (AP) - Texas Gov. Rick Perry unexpectedly canceled plans to visit areas hit by a massive Central Texas wildfire.
A Perry spokeswoman said the governor's scheduled visit on Saturday of damaged areas in Bastrop County near Austin as well as his participation in a news conference with local and state officials did not take place because of "logistical issues" with Perry arriving in Bastrop on time.
Perry's office on Friday had announced the governor would visit the area.
Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle said the governor was in Austin and was keeping in regular contact with officials on the wildfire.
Castle did not say when Perry would return to Bastrop. Perry visited the area earlier this week after he cut short a presidential campaign trip to deal with the crisis.

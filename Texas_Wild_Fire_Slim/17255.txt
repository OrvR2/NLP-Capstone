Unpatriotic Teamsters Hoarding Mounds of Cash
by 
                
			  	Kyle Olson			  	




The Left’s working motto consistently turns out to be “do as I say, not as I do.”  How else could they possibly make bold pronouncements to the media but live the exact opposite?
The day before his declaration of war on the Tea Party movement, Teamsters President James Hoffa appeared on CNN and deemed American companies as “unpatriotic,” according to the Political Ticker.
“I think the president should challenge the patriotism of these American corporations that are sitting on the sidelines,” Hoffa said. “The problem in America isn’t that we don’t have enough money. We’ve got more money than any other country in the world. The problem is American businesses not spending it and not getting it in the game.”
Is Hoffa willing to have his own patriotism challenged?  Because some inconvenient truths emerge from the financial report his Teamsters union filed with the federal government.
According to an LM-2 report filed earlier this year, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents truck drivers and some school employees, ended 2010 with $108,608,477 in the bank.  That’s a whopping 24.9% increase in net assets over 2009, when the union reported $86,942,076 in assets.

In contrast, the Teamsters reported $88,371,439 in liabilities.  So if the union could afford to go without any new revenue and still meet its obligations for well over 12 months.

There is a trend in the union’s growing net assets.  The Teamsters ended 2009 with $86,942,076 in the bank, according to that year’s LM-2 report.  That’s an even more impressive 33.4% increase in net assets over 2008, when the union reported $65,148,734 in assets.
From 2008 to 2010, the Teamsters net assets grew an impressive 66.7% – a rate that would make any corporate board of directors smitten with its CEO.
So, James, where is your American spirit?  You’re hoarding cash, just like you accuse the corporations of doing. Why doesn’t the union do its part and hire some unemployed Americans to do whatever the Teamsters actually do?
Or is that just the responsibility of the fat cat, jet-owning, unpatriotic CEOs?
And while we’re at it, let’s talk about your $368,000 annual compensation package. Where’s your solidarity with the unemployed workers of Detroit?  Can’t you give up your “fair share” of your salary and perks so they can have a little? Or do you enjoy living like a corporate CEO?
The reason corporations – and apparently unions – are hoarding investment dollars is because President Obama and his administration have cultivated an unstable environment in which to do business. Companies don’t know what their tax, regulatory and health care liabilities are going to be under this anti-business administration, so they’re sitting on the sidelines.  They’re being responsible to their investors and existing employees.
The best thing to do is to drop the strong-arm rhetoric and convince the president to create a stable environment to allow business to do what it does best – create job opportunities for Americans.  But that would run contrary to the leftist, Hoffa-type gasbag narrative of evil, unpatriotic corporations, and we just can’t have that in an election season.

That pile looks like what it's going to take to buy a loaf of bread in the not too distant future.

Typical communists! So much for the Marxism … A fair day's wages for a fair day's work.

At 12:01PM tomorrow we will officially have less than 500 days of idiot Obama left as President…

pilgrim_shadow - September 7th, 2011 at 1:41 pm
Where the hell did you think the stimulus money was going?




InfidelCzar - September 7th, 2011 at 1:47 pm
So, to summarize, we’re a racist lynch mob made up of barbarians trying to break down the gates, sons of bitches who need to be taken out and sent straight to hell.  But something just doesn't add up; I guess it's all that loose change he's so dying to give away to Big Gov.




OldmanRick - September 7th, 2011 at 1:48 pm
Hoffa's a dim. Dims don't spend their own money. They only spend other peoples' money. It the marxist Chicago way. Dontcha know.




Canuck_Grit - September 7th, 2011 at 1:48 pm
You're not taking into account the 4 years between 2013 and 2017.




knuckles - September 7th, 2011 at 1:53 pm
Yes he is.




Markg55 - September 7th, 2011 at 1:56 pm
You mean when he is behind bars?
Just what has Obama done for you?

GaltFan - September 7th, 2011 at 2:02 pm
Troll must agree that Obama is an idiot – he didn't dispute that part… 
I ain't looking forward to the 40yrs of him yammering about how everyone let him down, but at least he will be out of official power soon… If we survive… (we will)




R_Swift - September 7th, 2011 at 2:04 pm
Are you intending to help him get re-elected?




GaltFan - September 7th, 2011 at 2:04 pm
I don't care how long he serves as the president of his prison gang…




ETMETM - September 7th, 2011 at 2:04 pm
"In contrast, the Teamsters reported $88,371,439 in liabilities.  So if the union could afford to go without any new revenue and still meet its obligations for well over 12 months." 
Kyle does not know the difference between liabilities and expenses. If we want to win the argument we have to know what we are talking about.




no_more_deceit - September 7th, 2011 at 2:07 pm
"Hoffa’s union salary in 2010 – the most recent figures available – was $294,285. That figure rises to $368,000 if bonuses and disbursements are taken into account."  from: http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/teamsters-hof... 
How ya like that? "sons of a bitches" Millionaire every 3 years is middle class?




SunshineConnie - September 7th, 2011 at 2:09 pm
Jimmy Jr is planning a nice retirement unlike his daddy.

Do not discount the expense account, car & driver, and conference vacations either.

Yea, these are the same turds that are going to be running obamacare  




knuckles - September 7th, 2011 at 2:14 pm
No one's defending Obama anymore. Even the other Communists are sick of him – he's giving totalitarianism a bad name..




palidin911 - September 7th, 2011 at 2:21 pm
It's the unions who are sons of bitches, and Hoffa is the biggest. Lets take these sons of bitches out.




Joseph_of_Steel - September 7th, 2011 at 2:21 pm
"You're not taking into account the 4 years between 2013 and 2017. "  
Actually, BETWEEN 2013 and 2017…..there are 3 years.  
But, keep doing what you do best.  
Be wrong.




GaltFan - September 7th, 2011 at 2:23 pm
Lifted restrictions granting Cuban Americans unrestricted rights to visit family and send remittances to the island 
- Supporting Communism  
Eliminated subsidies to private lender middlemen of student loans and protect student borrowers 
- Placed student loans in the hands of political hacks – sure to promote the freedom of inquiry…  
Expanded hate crime law in the US to include sexual orientation through the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act 
- Criminalized thought and made some individuals "more equal" under the law  
Signed financial reform law establishing a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to look out for the interests of everyday Americans 
- Created more red tape, raised costs for business (ultimately consumers) and established another broad intrusion into the private lives of all Americans  
Cut prescription drug cost for medicare recipients by 50% 
- At somebody's expense. Whose? Yours? Mine? Children yet to be born?  
Provided $12.2 Billion in new funding for Individuals With Disabilities Education Act 
- I didn't realize HE had that much money… Or did someone NOT getting the "credit" pay for it?  
Appointed more openly gay officials than any other president in US history 
- Not necessarily the same people, but he has also appointed more unqualified officials than any president – including two to the Supreme Court.  
The American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009: a $789 billion economic stimulus plan 
- Somehow I think he will be running from that – rather than on it…  
Created more private sector jobs in 2010 than during entire Bush years 
- Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!! Does ANYBODY believe that crap? Did they all disappear January 1, 2011? Or did he mean they were created in China? 
Signed New START Treaty – nuclear arms reduction pact with Russia 
- Another worthless sop to Communists that also weakened American national security  
Increased average fuel economy standards from 27.5mpg to 35.5mpg, starting in 2016 
- Key word being "standards" – He accomplished nothing  
Barack Obama is an @ss with a mean disposition and a small mind preoccupied with wishful thinking…  
FAIL




Joseph_of_Steel - September 7th, 2011 at 2:25 pm
“I think the president should challenge the patriotism of these American corporations that are sitting on the sidelines,” Hoffa said. 
What would be patriotic about throwing money away? 
I don't even understand Hoffa's point here. 
I seem to remember, during the Bush year……Dems constantly saying that they were patriotic opposition. 
So, wouldn't the same principle apply to a business that does not want to support these horrendous Obamanomic policies? 
They are patriotically showing their opposition…..by not enabling Obama's spending.




Markg55 - September 7th, 2011 at 2:27 pm
Townships and School Districts is all i seem to find on the map. No jobs were listed as saved.
We would have been fine without this wasteful spending.
350 new regulations in July alone for small business.
ZERO!




Quayle2012_KNOT - September 7th, 2011 at 2:28 pm
Slashing personal and corporate tax rates is a sure fire way to give "certainty" and a "pro-business climate" necessary to grow the economy. That's what we did with the 2002-2003 bush tax cuts. It just takes a little while to trickle down, that's all. Be patient.




GaltFan - September 7th, 2011 at 2:29 pm
I think Grit is just funnin' us. Check out that link he posted. It is as damning as anything else I have seen… I summarized some of the "highlights" below… Hardly something a "supporter" would want to get out…




AverageJoeTexas - September 7th, 2011 at 2:30 pm
Takes a lot of cash to buy Congressmen, and the elections are this year.  That money has already been earmarked for that purpose I am sure




no_more_deceit - September 7th, 2011 at 2:34 pm
Have you heard/seen this one?:          "Well, it turns out that illegal aliens, most of which pay zero in net taxes, enjoyed $4.2 billion from the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) last year.  That’s more than the annual revenue from the selected oil tax deductions and corporate jet deductions combined!"  from: http://www.redstate.com/dhorowitz3/2011/09/02/ill... 
Or " The Treasury report explains that an increasing number of aliens who file with ITINs are claiming the ACTC, resulting in a massive increase in government payouts to illegal aliens. In fact, over the past five years, IRS payouts for the ACTC have increased from $924 million to $4.2 billion. (TIGTA Report 2011-41-061, July 7, 2011)"  from:  http://www.rightsidenews.com/2011090614440/us/hom...




Quayle2012_KNOT - September 7th, 2011 at 2:35 pm
Wrong again, Kyle. The pension fund is fully invested in AMERICAN companies with ONSHORE operations. What else you got?




GaltFan - September 7th, 2011 at 2:36 pm
Good comment. Too bad you were being sarcastic… You forgot the other half of the equation though – slash suffocating regulations. Still and all, getting half the picture accurately is pretty good for a stupid troll…




Joseph_of_Steel - September 7th, 2011 at 2:37 pm
Just curious…..didn't Hoffa's poppa once go to jail for raiding the teamster's pension fund?




R_Swift - September 7th, 2011 at 2:41 pm
SO WHAT! 4+ TRILLION added to National Debt so far, building to 9.7 TRILLION in the next decade, 26 MILLION affected by unemployment, 1.3% GPD, appointed 38 czars, An unconstitutional, government mandated healthcare system, brought us to a near depression, the systematic destruction of our energy industry, Invaded the auto to save union jobs and banking industries to destroy them, Fast & Furious,
From your link some of the worst,
Signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, signed multiple embryonic stem cell bills,ended Bush administration's CIA program of 'enhanced interrogation methods' by requiring that the Army field manual be used as the guide for terrorism interrogations, signed bill to close Guantonomo, Health Care Reform Bill, allowing children to remain covered by their parents' insurance until the age of 26, increased funding for national parks and forests by 10%, expanded hate crime law in the US to include sexual orientation through the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, appointed nation's first Chief Technology Officer, signed financial reform law establishing a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to look out for the interests of everyday Americans, extended Benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees, the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009: a $789 billion economic stimulus plan, created more private sector jobs in 2010 than during entire Bush years BULL SH!T!, signed new Start Treaty, Appointed first Latina to the US Supreme Court, Promoted social responsibility through creation of serve.gov, a national database of volunteer opportunities, signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, giving the FDA the authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco for the first time…. and there is more.




Joseph_of_Steel - September 7th, 2011 at 2:44 pm
And btw, which pension fund are you even talking about? 
There are multiple teamster pension funds.




knuckles - September 7th, 2011 at 2:44 pm
I just read through it….increased funding for national parks ? signed a few more laws into place ? Loosened up travel to Cuba ? (Obama probably has a house there). Not exactly earth-shattering. A 10-year old could accomplish that ("let's spend more money on the national parks  Daddy…").
Yeah, I think Grit's horsing around… that's ok. We need the levity.




Joseph_of_Steel - September 7th, 2011 at 2:48 pm
A few years ago, Harvard put out a report highlighting the possible positive effects of pension funds investing in infrastructure.  
The president wants an infrastructure bank.  
Hoffa wants patriotic investment.  
Hey, Jimmy, how about you take those teamster pension funds and fund an infastructure bank!!  
You can make money for your fund AND initiate the driving force behind rebuilding America!! I mean you believe that Obama's plans of more spending on 'shovel ready' jobs are going to do it, right? You can save the country AND ensure your union brothers have great future income!  
Put your money where your mouth is……  
…..or shut up.




no_more_deceit - September 7th, 2011 at 2:53 pm
Sure they are, like GE? Immelt as adviser to White House?  
""If he does not resign, the White House should remove him," Kucinich said. 
“As 14 million Americans struggle with unemployment, General Electric, under Mr. Immelt’s leadership, is exporting highly-sophisticated technology to the Chinese in order to book short-term profits for GE. GE strives mightily to avoid paying federal income taxes, but goes ‘all in’ on a deal to transfer U.S. government-subsidized technology to the Chinese. Jeffrey Immelt has a conflict of interest. He cannot ethically advise the President on how to create American jobs and promote American competiveness, while at the same time leading a company that is exporting American technology and, along with it, American jobs,” said Kucinich.   from: https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2011/08/24-...

So you say.   Like all regressives, you can't back a single word of it.




Syrin23 - September 7th, 2011 at 3:11 pm
From a previous post:   
Under Kenendy, tax cuts created 10 MILLION jobs and $200 BILLION more in tax revenue.
Under Reagan, tax cuts created 12 MILLION jobs and $300 BILLION more in tax revenue.
Under Bush, tax cuts created 10 MILLION jobs and $200 BILLION more in tax revenue.   
So yeah, dumb ass, tax cuts actually DO work. History doesn't lie, just you regressives. Not to mention that the SAME action had the same result in three different decades under both political parties. Funny how those things called "facts" never are on your side.

Can you name a single policy of Obamugabe that anyone likes or that was successful? 
Once you get past that, can you explain why you have your head so far up Soros' ass it keeps you from being logical?

Abolish all unions.  Confiscate their money and use it to pay down the debt Obama's racked up!

Quayle2012_KNOT - September 7th, 2011 at 3:32 pm
Then since the Bush corporate and personal income tax cuts were extended, all we have to do is wait for the free market to work it's magic! Great news!!




GaltFan - September 7th, 2011 at 3:44 pm
Uh, yeah… See it was the "Community Reinvestment Act" that FORCED lenders to give bad loans, and then widely encouraged as many of those to be made as possible since Fannie/Freddie executives (connected Democrat operatives) were actively committing fraud and cooking the books. Sorry loser, your hollow talking points are no good here… Books are for reading, not just coloring…




Syrin23 - September 7th, 2011 at 3:49 pm
No, because you ass bags have done everything you can to destroy the free market through mass regulation, violation of law, over stepping power.   Just ask Boeing, former GM shareholders, etc etc etc.  We are FAR more socialistic than European nations.   Not even close. 
What we NEED to do, is get the gov't and it's annual $1.75 TRILLION worth of regulations the hell out of the way, and let people be entrepreneurs.  
Being a perpetual burger flipper, I am sure you can't even begin to fathom the costs facing small businesses.   It's the employee mentality.

Have to agree with you here.  I have a finance and accounting background, and I said, "huh?"  Yes, their assets grew, which means that their income (i.e. contributions and investment income) exceeded expenses.  And if they liquidated all their assets, they have enough to pay off all their liabilities.  But his argument does not spell this out clearly enough. 
Then again, what exactly are those liabilities? Salaries payable?  Loans?  Bribes payable?   




hezaAZsmitty - September 7th, 2011 at 5:10 pm
members of the various union are the definition of "useful idiots".  Union dues replenished from payroll deductions keep the gravy flowing.  Ever wonder, union members, with this type of money on hand why unions hire non-union picketer?  Ever wonder why, with this kind of loot in the poke, strike benefits are a fraction of what you earn when on the job?  Ever wonder why your business agent, local president never seem to suffer along with ya'll?  If you haven't, you are the idiots they use.




Obamahehateme - September 7th, 2011 at 5:13 pm
The article fails to take in the additional annual compensation for Hoffa…….around $103,300.  Found on the Teamsters IRS Form 990.  How does that feel to the unemployed union folk?

JeffersonAdams - September 7th, 2011 at 5:28 pm
"The pension fund is fully invested in AMERICAN companies with ONSHORE operations." 
Most are non-union companies. That way it's not a toxic asset but a wise investment.

I think all employees working for the SEIU, AFL-CIO, Teamsters, ACORN etc…should have the right and opportunity to join a union and benefit from a collective bargaining agreement. 
Actually I could give a funk; I just want to see them go on strike.

Obama is a sponger.  He uses someone else's house there.

Appointed more openly gay officials than any other president in US history  
I thought sexual orientation wasn't supposed to matter.  We are all supposed to not notice.  Why the flag-flying over singling people out?

Now, the next step is understanding that "YOU", yes "YOU" personally (even though you're crippled by your liberalism), can actually spend "your money" in a fashion better suited to you and your community than B. Hussein Obama and his financially insane 'economics' advisers can!!!

Qualy – Are you really under the impression that the ONLY hurdle the government places in the path to Americans' prosperity is "high taxes"??? 
Or, is that your ignorance or addiction to koolaid talking???

Ever notice how union scumbags like hoffa and stern pull down great salaries and benefits?  I wonder if some of the IGNORANT SHEEP that support these CORRUPT SOBs actually stop and think about that!

Did Hoffa donate anything to a church, as we're susposed to promote the Gospels?

Maybe someone had better get one of the gold tip pens they sell in office supply places and check that cash for counterfeits?  Almost everything about unions is counterfeit, fraud, deceit, coersion and a fundamental commitment illegal gains or profiteering.  That cash probably wouldn't pass muster at a convenience store!




NotKennedy - September 8th, 2011 at 5:00 am
Did you notice how sloppily piled up the 'money' is in that picture?  Yeah, union dolts don't have much ability to organize anything but bums to hang out on street corners, public buildings and public schools.  When it comes to money, it just gets piled up like a heap of trash.  Union cash ain't nothing but trash!




Small Thoughts - September 8th, 2011 at 5:11 am
If the unions have mounds of unspent cash they should reduce dues. That would take care of their members more than making campaign contributions and paying the salaries of their fat cat leaders like Hoffa.

He is a scum bag, like most union bosses. They steal money from their members to line their own pockets then blame others for the woes.
Get ob out of office put these union thugs in jail

Hoffa actually gave me the name,as we all know.  Those two were my inspiration to use it.  It appeals to my crotchety half.

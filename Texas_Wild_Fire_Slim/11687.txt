KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SELLING AND WHAT IT’S WORTH









[ Print |

You wouldn’t sell a car or home without having some type of estimate of what it is worth.  The same is true for selling timber.  If someone is offering you money on the spot for your timber there are likely others out there interested in purchasing you timber as well.  The best way to know what you are selling is to have a management plan that outlines what type of forests you have, what products are available in the forest and the recommended management alternatives available to you.  A timber cruise is also a valuable resource that allows a survey of the timber to help in determining the value, composition and management alternatives available in each timber stand on your property.  Once again, these resources are available through your professional foresters.  It is not recommended for you to handle the timber sale on your own unless you are very familiar with the process and have extensive experience in implementing forest management recommendations on your property.  Marketing of the same timber stand from one market to others that you are not aware of could literally cost you thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars which would easily pay for the professional services of a forester to oversee the entire process.
The Texas Forest Service provides a document that is updated quarterly to provide landowners with approximate trends in current prices for timber sales in different regions of the state.  The professional forester you decide to work with can assist you further with current price trends and prices you should expect to receive for your timber.

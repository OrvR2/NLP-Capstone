Texas is facing the worst wildfire season in the state's history, and Bastrop wildfires have consumed more than 600 houses. These extraordinary wildfires will cause economic losses greater than $100 million dollars. At least 25,000 acres in Bastrop, Texas has suffered the consequences of these out-of-control wildfires. All efforts are being used to control the wildfires from spreading even with bulldozers and motograders building berms to control wildfire perimeter. 
Wildfires throughout United States burn an average of 5 million acres every year spreading at a rate of up to 14 miles per hour. Wood is one the principal component of Bastrop structures and one of the most flammable materials used, causing these wildfires to spread more easily. Follow these recommendations to reduce the damages caused by wildfires:

 Select fire resistant materials, such as stone and bricks.

 Cover all vents adequately with metal mesh screen. Mesh should be no larger than six millimeters.
 Use multi-pane windows, safety glass or install fireproof shutters to reduce radiant heat.
 Insulate chimneys and place spark arresters on top of them.
Chimneys should extend at least three feet above the structure roof.

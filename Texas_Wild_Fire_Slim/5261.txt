Comcast employees are Obama’s biggest donorsBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – Fri, Aug 26, 2011

(AP/Charles Dharapak)
Comcast employees have Barack Obama's back in 2012.
People who work at the nation's largest Internet provider and the parent company to NBC Universal donated more money to the Obama Victory Fund--a joint fund-raising committee for President Barack Obama's re-election campaign and the Democratic National Committee--than employees at any other organization, The Ticket's Chris Moody writes, citing a new report by the Center for Responsive Politics.
According to data from the Federal Election Commission, Comcast workers donated almost $200,000 this year to the fund, which raised nearly $40 million through the end of June.
Obama has held two fundraisers hosted by Comcast's top brass in recent months, the first at the home of the company's vice president David Cohen in Philadelphia, and another at Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts' summer home in Martha's Vineyard. In the 2010 congressional election cycle, Comcast employees donated about $1.7 million to Democrats and $1.1 million to Republicans.
 MSNBC sacked Keith Olbermann shortly before Comcast's merger with NBC Universal was approved, less than three months after the network suspended the outspoken cable host for donating to three Democratic candidates running in 2010, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona.
The Obama Victory Fund relies on California, New York and Massachusetts for nearly half of its donations, according to The Ticket's report. Gifts from California comprised about a quarter of the president's war chest with $9.9 million.

Comrade Obozo is SUCH a Hypocrite.  His buddy, the CEO of Comcast whom Obozo and family visited during their poshy vacay at Martha's Vineyard, is the proud owner of a CORPORATE JET.  You know, the same CORPORATE JETS that Comrade Obozo continually rails about, in every speech on the economy.  The CEO of Comcast has been under fire because the CORPORATE JET is used almost exclusively to jet his family around from their summer home at the Vineyard to their OTHER summer home in Florida and their various homes and Cottages across the United States.  Comrade Obozo aspires to the same lifestyle as his buddy, but tries to play the Class Warfare game for his Commiecrat base.  
HYPOCRITE TO THE CORE!!  ONE AND DONE IN 2012!

Comcast will see a slew of disconnects soon. Supporting him is Un-American and anti-white.

Obama can't do much, but he sure can raise some serious money.  Doesn't matter though---he's a goner in 2012.

How do you like that America?  Obama bails out unions with your money and then the unions hand your money over to democrats whether you want to support them or not.  Sound like taxation without representation to you?

Comcast.  Like I'm letting them think for me.  Sure.  Forget about political parties folks.  This 12' election is a referendem on "policy".  You decide what policy makes the most sense and align yourself with those you think most capable of carrying out that policy.  Ask your own questions.  Get your own answers.  Get involved.  America will survive only if it's citizens lead, not it's political parties.  Get busy.  Get studied.  Get involved.  Get to the polls.

Are you people just plain stupid or what...not that you giving money to Obamam but that you doing through a PAC. I know the big swing is the idiots at NBC, but come on people give your money where it will do the most good, in your local elections. Do you understand that Obama regulations are coming after comcast and your paycheck!

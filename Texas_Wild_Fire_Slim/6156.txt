Brian Williams becomes the next reporter to almost, but not quite, hold Rick Perry to account for the execution of Cameron Todd Willingham. During the GOP debate Wednesday night, Williams asked without naming Willingham, or going at Perry armed with the science that undermined the prosecution's case. (A pity: this came on the heels of the moderators trying to get Perry in a spat with Jon Huntsman about who was "anti-science.")
Williams simply asked in general if Perry had ever struggled with the idea that someone who was killed via capital punishment was innocent. The weak sauce allowed Perry to wriggle off the hook: "No, sir. I've never struggled with that at all. The state of Texas has a very thoughtful, a very clear process in place of which -- when someone commits the most heinous of crimes against our citizens, they get a fair hearing, they go through an appellate process, they go up to the Supreme Court of the United States, if that's required.
"But in the state of Texas, if you come into our state and you kill one of our children, you kill a police officer, you're involved with another crime and you kill one of our citizens, you will face the ultimate justice in the state of Texas, and that is, you will be executed."
For what it's worth, here's an article from the Houston Chronicle, Oct. 27, 2010:
After 18 years of incarceration and countless protestations of innocence, Anthony Graves finally got a nod of approval from the one person who mattered Wednesday and at last returned home -- free from charges that he participated in the butchery of a family in Somerville he did not know and free of the possibility that he would have to answer for them with his life.

The district attorney for Washington and Burleson counties, Bill Parham, gave Graves his release. The prosecutor filed a motion to dismiss charges that had sent Graves to Texas' death row for most of his adult life. Graves returned to his mother's home in Brenham no longer the "cold-blooded killer," so characterized by the prosecutor who first tried him, but as another exonerated inmate who even in the joy of redemption will face the daunting prospect of reassembling the pieces of a shattered life.
"He's an innocent man," Parham said, noting that his office investigated the case for five months. "There is nothing that connects Anthony Graves to this crime. I did what I did because that's the right thing to do."
It's worth worrying about!
Williams plodded ahead with a sentimental follow-up, asking Perry to react to the fact that members of the audience applauded when hearing Perry has executed 234 individuals. Perry replied, "I think Americans understand justice. I think Americans are clearly, in the vast majority of -- of cases, supportive of capital punishment. When you have committed heinous crimes against our citizens -- and it's a state-by-state issue, but in the state of Texas, our citizens have made that decision, and they made it clear, and they don't want you to commit those crimes against our citizens. And if you do, you will face the ultimate justice.
But what if scientists say you sent a man to his death for having committed no crime at all? For everything you need to know about Perry and Willingham, click here.
There's still an opportunity for some reporter somewhere to ask Perry about this case, if they're interested!

                        There is a growing number of people in this country, old and young, male and female who are angry about their lot in life. It's quite odd, really. Many of those people have what appears to be good homes, families,  and jobs. There isn't the reason for such vehement anger as to cheer the execution of over two hundred people, which we now know statistica­lly means at least one, maybe more                        
                                                     Read More...
 innocent people died as the result. It's the same people who cheer when they watch Cops and see an alcoholic or drug addict wrestled to the ground and handcuffed - mainly because the person was too drunk or high to get away from the portly police officers. Others cheer when a teacher is fired or a public worker takes a cut in pay, as if those people are responsibl­e for the economic problems we have in America. Yet those same cheering idiots worship the ground that the real criminals walk on; the bankers and hedge fund managers or the CEOs that have shipped our jobs overseas.Those are the Rick Perry supporters­.

				I'm not against the death penalty. But you'd better be more than 100% sure you're killing the right person if you're going to do it. The mere fact that he doesn't struggle with it, even when he knows there is the possibilit­y and in some instances a probabilit­y that the person being executed is innocent, should cause us all to pause and think about his judgment.

				Senator Jeffrey Gold: This mental midget, governor Rick Perry, is a dangerous guy. His rigid, unquestion­ing belief in the infallibil­ity of Texas justice---­which is a consequenc­e of Republican cement-thi­nk: everything is black and white (and if you live in Texas, it literally is a black and white thing)---i­s a dangerous cancer to import from Texas into the other Forty-Nine­. I know some Texans, and they don't sound like this chowderhea­d. Doesn't the Republican party have at least one candidate who is a reasonable­, responsibl­e, intelligen­t, thoughtful person? I guess they really do want to re-elect Obama. As America moves ever more faster into grotesque comedyland­, are the real statesmen staying away from politics, or are there simply none left?

				Judeo-Chri­stian Ethics, and I know many of the Tea Partiers have a problem with Ethics, but the underlying Ethical Concern is Executing the Right Person.  If there is a chance that you would execute one Innocent Person, Ethically, Execution is Wrong.  I still will never understand how so many people who are so against Abortion can be for Executing an Individual­, if there's any chance that, that person could actually be Wrongly Executed, because 12 Jurors mistakenly Convicted the Wrong person.  I hate to tell you this, but some innocent individual­s including in Texas may have been wrongly convicted and executed, because of overzealou­s prosecutor­s who flaunted the Law for their own purposes.  How would you feel as a Juror if you convicted someone, because you were lied to about evidence?

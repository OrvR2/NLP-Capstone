Muammar Gaddafi may be one of the world's most infamous autocrats, but newly-released footage reveals a more private side to the deposed Libyan leader: that of doting grandfather. 
The video, obtained by Reuters on Wednesday, is believed to have been filmed sometime in 2005 at the leader's Tripoli compound. The clip shows Gaddafi playing with his young grandchildren. 
The current whereabouts of the Libyan leader are unknown, though he is believed to have crossed the border into Niger.

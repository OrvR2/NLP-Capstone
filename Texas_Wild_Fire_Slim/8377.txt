Paterson plays where asked, at 4 World CupsBy DENNIS PASSA - AP Sports Writer | AP – 7 hrs ago





INVERCARGILL, New Zealand (AP) — Chris Paterson stands in the back of a century-old theater two days away from his 106th test match, taking the odd gibe from several of his Scottish teammates over his lengthy career in the sport.The 33-year-old Paterson was named Thursday in Scotland's team to play Romania in a Group B match at the World Cup. It's his fourth World Cup, the first player from Scotland to achieve the feat.Underscoring his longevity, though, is the Edinburgh stalwart's versatility. He'll start Saturday's match at fullback, where he's played most recently, but has also appeared for Scotland at flyhalf and on both wings.Scotland coaches tend to find room for Paterson due to his prodigious and radar-like goalkicking.Paterson, who made his World Cup debut against Italy in 1999, doesn't mind the different views on the field."I'll play where they need me," he tells The Associated Press. It's no throwaway line.He's become a fan favorite in Scotland because of that commitment to the team, wherever on the field. Asked if this will be his last World Cup, Paterson says to "wait and see if I can be a help to the guys in this one."And he admits, as he has before, that there is a certain "fear factor" to him retiring."Not sure what else I would do," Paterson said.What he's already done is impressive.After playing that one match against Italy in 1999, where Scotland lost in the quarterfinals to New Zealand, Paterson was a standout in Australia in 2003.Playing flyhalf, Paterson scored two tries and kicked a conversion and penalty in a 32-11 win over Japan. He then scored 19 points, including a try, in a 39-15 win over the United States. Overall, he accumulated 71 points as Scotland again went out in the quarterfinals following a defeat to Australia.In 2007, Paterson played in all five of Scotland's matches and scored 46 points. And unfortunately for Paterson and Scotland, the team again went out in the quarterfinals again, losing to Argentina.Paterson kicked an amazing 36 straight goals for Scotland from August 2007 through June 7, 2008, including the 2007 World Cup and the 2008 Six Nations tournament, before he finally missed a shot. His accuracy and length has been helped by a former Australian Rules football ruckman who was hired by the Scottish Rugby Union as a kicking coach.At 1.83 meters (6-0) and weighing just 80 kilograms (176 pounds), Paterson's small stature has stood him mostly well during his career against injuries.One of his most serious, though, came in his 100th test — also a first for a Scot. On Feb. 13, 2010, playing against Wales at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Paterson suffered a split kidney which forced him to miss the rest of the season.In 2004, he fractured his right cheekbone after being hit in a test match against Samoa, his only other major injury blemish.That's no doubt helped by the fact he formerly trained as a physical fitness instructor, doesn't drink alcohol and spends time staying fit as a keen golfer.Even so, Scotland's leading scorer with 786 points, including 22 tries, realizes he may not add much more to that total as his career winds down.When he finally calls it quits, he hopes to look back at this World Cup as one of his highlights. But being the consummate team man, only if Scotland can get past the quarterfinal stage."Playing my fourth is certainly something that's right up there," Paterson said. "This time, I'm hoping we can get further than before."

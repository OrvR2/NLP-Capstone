@freddy420ish You don't see how my point of view about extreme right wing religious people may﻿ be different coming from an atheist? I think they would probably say everything is fine here in OK.

@shutuz12 Emergency aid isn't welfare dipshit. Government aid assist in financing longer hours for firemen & helicopters that drop water etc.... People's homes get burned down, government aid is﻿ necessary to help those who don't have a home anymore.

@203207ab because we don't believe in welfare, its for communists only, people﻿ should be responsible for themselves only,

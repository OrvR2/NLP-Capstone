OGDEN, Utah -- Authorities are considering charges after a Utah man was found butchering a cow in his driveway.
Police say when officers arrived, the man was removing the cow's head. He denied shooting the animal, and told the officers it had been delivered dead.
Prosecutors are now reviewing the case for potential charges, including possible health code violations.

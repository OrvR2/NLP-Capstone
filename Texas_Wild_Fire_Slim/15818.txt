Official YOFF Clock
















The Bells of YOFF

When'er the Bells be heard at night,
long after the last of the dying light,
the spirits of Truth and Honor roam, 
purposefully from their YOFF spun home.

 Spreading the news from far and wide, 
that The Powers That Be still conspire, not confide,
and woe be the souls still sleeping, abide,
the bells sound the midnight call, wake up, ride.

 Whosoever be lucky to hear,
The Bells of YOFF tolling dear,
count your blessings, once, three times,
and remember forever hearing the chimes.

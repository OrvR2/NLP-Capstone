Which ends tomorrow, of course.

Set your clocks back an hour.
Change the batteries on your smoke alarm.
Hit my tip jar.



 
Hey, worth a shot.

The ‘Paranormal Activity’ mini-review.

A very taut film by a clever director who knew when to get out of the way and let the audience go ahead and scare itself.  There’s a Paramount executive out there right now who is basking in the insane amount of profit that this film is going to gather for the studio.  As a horror flick, it’s good; as a horror flick done on a $15,000 budget it’s freaking insanely good.  It’s not perfect – there’s a couple of holes in the plot, and the ending I saw may be the weakest of the three – but it’s worth going to see in theaters.

James Earl Jones recites ‘The Raven.’

This doesn’t count as hokey… what?  Oh, yes, by all means, get yourself comfortable, not to mention a glass of something.  We can wait.
Ready?
Enjoy.

Another thing the Corzine campaign would like you to ignore….

…regarding the Jason Shih drug bust: the fact that a Jason Shih of Paramus was on the Democrats’ payroll in 2006 (H/T: JammieWearingFool).  Complete coincidence.  Couldn’t possibly be the same person.  There must be thousands of Jason Shihs in New Jersey.
Actually, no, deja vu isn’t really the right reaction to this.

Meanwhile, pay no attention to this drug bust in NJ.

The Corzine campaign wants it made CLEAR that Jason Shih is in no way, shape, or form involved with the releection campaign; that Mr. Shih is certainly not an assistant campaign director or staffer for the campaign; that they have no idea who Mr. Shih would even is, let alone why he would claim such a status; or why he would claim that the car that he was driving at the time of his drug bust was rented by the campaign, or why there were tickets to an Obama rally and other campaign paraphernalia mixed in with the drug paraphernalia.
Understand?  They want it made CLEAR.

“…AND SMASH IT WITH A HAMMER!”

Plumcake of Manolo for the Big Girl – which is a fun read, by the way – has a post up on Disney Villainesses; it features Ursula of The Little Mermaid (which is my favorite Disney film) and Yzma of The Emperor’s New Groove (which is apparently everybody’s second favorite Disney film).  Plumcake, alas, had to give Yzma an honorable mention on account that she wasn’t really scary; which is true, but irrelevant.
Third favorite?  Mulan, probably: I like heroines with good tactical sense.

Nancy Pelosi’s non-tort reform.

Jen Rubin:
Remember Obama’s effort to try a “test” for tort reform? (We don’t actually need a test, since it has worked to lower medical malpractice coverage and help increase access to doctors in states that have tried it.) Well, Pelosi’s bill has an anti-tort-reform measure. On pages 1431-1433 of the 1990 spellbinder, there is a financial incentive for states to try “alternative medical liability laws.” But look — you don’t get the incentive if you have a law that would “limit attorneys’ fees or impose caps on damages.”
See Hot Air for more, including a link to the actual language and a reminder that the Democrats never had any intention of doing anything at all to disconcert trial lawyers.  Which is the point that I’d like to hammer home, here: there is no reason to be surprised at this.  We knew back in August that something like this was going to happen; and this is precisely the sort of political doubletalk that the people opposing the Democrats’ health care rationing bill have come to expect from the current ruling party.
So.  To any random Democrats reading this: when Nancy Pelosi looks you in the eye and tells you that the new health care bill addresses tort reform, she is lying to you.  Because she thinks that you are stupid.
She. Thinks. That. You. Are. Stupid.

I’ve decided: no hokey Halloween stuff today.

It exists: it is a favorite holiday; we shall have the candy with which to propitiate the Servants of Chaos ready for their intermittent visits.  But half the blogosphere will be out there doing an orange theme and making bad puns about pumpkins, so I thought that I’d spare you.
That being said: 28 Days Later may not be the best horror film that I’ve ever seen, but it’s the first one that I think of when I think of ‘great horror films.’  Then again, it’s one of the few horror flicks that I’ve seen in an actual theater.

PS: I reserve the right to non-Halloween hokeyness.

Now *there’s* a photo.

From Game 1 of the World Series. It’s going to be iconic, so go check it out; and then read the Anchoress’ accompanying article, which is worthy of it.

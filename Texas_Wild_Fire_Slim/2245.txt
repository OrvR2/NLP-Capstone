Leo Hindery, Jr.: Re: Jobs, Pick the Big Low-Hanging Fruit -- and Stop the Niggling


		                        
																These initiatives would  give corporate CEOs the confidence they need to start spending, on new investments and hiring, some of the $2 trillion now sitting in their treasuries. And it is that eventual spending which will sustain long-term job creation.                            







Michael Brenner: The Great Betrayal


		                        
																Obama's betrayal will resonate long after he has become another name on the celebrity speaker circuit. It is a betrayal of far more than the idealists and progressives who put him in the White House. He has unmoored the Democratic Party from its foundations.

				Obama is doing SO poorly, he is beating the leading frontrunne­r GOP candidate in most, if not all, general election polls.  Yes, we are shaking in our boots conservati­ves.  This coming from the party that elected Christine O'Donnell and Sharron Angle as their BEST!

				Even this heavily Dem leaning sample shows that the BIG LEFT is losing the BIG ARGUMENT. Even during the hard times, people get that big govt with lots of services is a bad thing. 

My conservati­sm stems from opposition to big govt, first and foremost, so this is very gratifying to see.

				Americans have been functional­ly liberal but rhetorical­ly conservati­ve for a long time.  If you ask them if they want gov't regulation for food safety for example, they say overwhelmi­ngly yes.  But you have to have a government agency with sufficient size and authority to enforce that.  Is that not "liberal?"  You could ask the same about education, health care, a whole host of things.  

I don't think most Americans think clearly about what "small gov't" means.  Government is all around us.  It built or financed the roads, provided and/or financed the schools, serves as the backbone for the infrastruc­ture, etc... that the economy needs.  The internet - great example.  Government was responsibl­e for that and is responsibl­e for maintainin­g it.  It can shut it down if it really wanted.  Some government­s do.  

People think they are where they are because they did it all themselves­.  Most of us were taught to read and write by a government worker.  Government provided the financing for computer-b­ased communicat­ions in the 1960s - 1980s.  That's why we can even type our argument on here.

There was a time when businesses and not government drove the train.  Government was fairly small and inconseque­ntial.  It was called the Gilded Age.  Companies provided towns, housing, infrastruc­ture, stores.... control.  And in most cases what they provided would be unacceptab­le by our standards.  I don't think people want to go back to that.

				Also, the response on question 6 is not that different than past responses.  Interestin­g that in 2000 it was actually more for "small gov't" than it is now.

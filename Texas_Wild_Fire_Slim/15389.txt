Frustration Grows For Texas Wildfire Evacuees
09.10.11 | No Comments



Residents left homeless by a massive Central Texas wildfire turned their attention Friday to what they need to move forward, with some voicing frustration over a perceived delay in federal response even as early signs of recovery appeared in reopened neighborhoods. Hit the jump to read the rest of the story.

Firefighters focused on extinguishing hotspots and had isolated remaining flames from the blaze that has burned for almost a week in and around the city of Bastrop, destroying nearly 1,400 homes and sweeping across about 45 square miles of rain-starved landscape.
“We believe the forward progress (of the fire) has been stopped, thank God for that,” Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst told evacuated residents gathered at the fire command center.
Still, thousands of evacuees were prevented from returning to their homes for a sixth day because trees continued to burn underground, loose power lines hung from scorched poles and more than 800 firefighters were working to tamp down the remainder of the fire 25 miles east of Austin.
“It’s just really frustrating,” said Dee Redenius, 40, who came to the fire command center for answers. “You want to know if your house is there or if it’s not. … They don’t let you in, you know. You can’t get assistance.”

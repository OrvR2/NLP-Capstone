TOKYO — Nobel laureate Kenzaburo Oe urged Japan's new prime minister on Tuesday to halt plans to restart nuclear power plants and instead abandon nuclear energy.
Oe cautioned Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda against prioritizing the economy over safety. Noda has said he will allow idled nuclear plants to resume operation when their safety is confirmed.
"The new prime minister seems to think that nuclear power plants are necessary for Japan's economy, and how to resume their operation is one of his key political agendas," Oe said. "We must make a big decision to abolish all nuclear plants."
Oe, who won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1994, said the accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi power plant six months ago caused the Japanese public to want to reduce their dependence on nuclear power, but that feeling seems to be fading.
He spoke at news conference Tuesday about an anti-nuclear petition drive, accompanied by other members of the campaign.
The group, which is demanding that the government decommission aging reactors and promote renewable energy, aims to collect 10 million signatures and submit them to the government next March.
Oe has actively supported pacifist and anti-nuclear campaigns and written books about the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II.
Noda, who took office last Friday, becoming Japan's six prime minister in five years, has said he does not plan to build new nuclear plants and will decommission those that are aged. But he said he plans to restart plants whose safety is confirmed to relieve power shortages and help Japan's economic recovery. More than 30 of the country's 54 reactors are idled, forcing a nationwide conservation effort this summer.
The nuclear accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant was like "a third atomic bombing" that Japan inflicted on itself, Oe said. "We already faced the major threat of radiation from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Now, many children will have to live with radiation threats for 10, 20 or 30 years from now."

				Kan: I couldn't let TEPCO withdraw from Fukushima disaster

Naoto Kan was told by his industry minister at 3 a.m., four days after the start of the crisis at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, that the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., was proposing to withdraw from the stricken facility.

In his first interview since leaving office, the former prime minister told The Asahi Shimbun on Sept. 5 that he had briefly stared into an abyss in which the plant's damaged nuclear reactors might have been abandoned.

"I thought, 'What would happen if (TEPCO) withdrew?' If we left the plant unattended­, everything might have melted down and things might have gone far beyond Chernobyl,­" Kan said.

"The word 'withdrawa­l' was not in my mind. The important thing was how we could, at all costs, bring the situation under control," Kan said. 

http://www­.asahi.com­/english/T­KY20110906­0244.html
__________­___

What I find unbelievab­le here (or maybe not), is that TEPCO actually considered withdrawin­g from the crisis. I would be really interested to hear THEIR honest explanatio­n of this. But heck, didn't TEPCO's CEO withdraw, by locking himself into his office for a week, before he was hospitaliz­ed?

Just this, TEPCO's intention of "withdrawi­ng" and leaving this whole mess up to others to solve, is why I firmly believe that nuclear power generation can not have a future. We simply can NOT allow it.

				Silly headline, but here it is anyway...

Fukushima'­s Reactor Cores Still Too Hot to Open

What will the social impact of the crisis be?
It might be too early to say. New data suggest that there will have to be a permanent exclusion zone near the plant, just like that around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, where there was a nuclear accident in 1986 (see Directly comparing Fukushima to Chernobyl)­. Political consequenc­es are still unfolding; at the end of August, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan resigned, owing in large part to critcism of the government­'s handling of the nuclear crisis.

What happens now?
In the short term, workers will continue to cool the reactors and clean up as much contaminat­ion as possible. But in the longer term they will have to actually remove the uranium from the reactor cores and transport it away from the coast, where it poses a major environmen­tal and health risk.

This will create an unpreceden­ted challenge. The radioactiv­e fuel inside the reactors is believed to have melted down completely­, and some or all of it has probably leaked from the stainless-­steel pressure vessel in which it was housed into the concrete enclosure below the reactor. The radiation will remain powerful enough to kill for decades to come, so workers will have to find a way to clean up and remove the fuel remotely.

				Fukushima Crisis Is Still Hazy

Tatsuhiko Kodama began his 27 July testimony to Japan's parliament with what he knew. In a firm, clear voice, he said that the Radioisoto­pe Center of the University of Tokyo, which he heads, had detected elevated radiation levels in the days following the meltdown of three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station. But when it came to what wasn't known, he became angry. "There is no definite report from the Tokyo Electric Power Company​ or the government as to exactly how much radioactiv­e material has been released from Fukushima!­" he shouted.

Kodama's impassione­d speech was posted on YouTube in late July and has received nearly 600,000 views, transformi­ng him into one of Japan's most visible critics of the government­. But he is not alone. Almost six months after an earthquake and tsunami triggered the meltdowns, other researcher­s say that crucial data for understand­ing the crisis are still missing, and funding snags and bureaucrac­y are hampering efforts to collect more....

				Radioactiv­e Iodine in Sewer Sludge in Oshu City, Iwate

Oshu City is located 187 kilometers north of Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant.

The city announced the latest survey of radioactiv­e materials in sewer sludge in a sewage treatment center in the city, and it shows iodine-131 being detected in the sludge cake since August 25.

From the city's announceme­nt on September 7.....  (See chart)

The city says it has stopped the shipment of sludge cakes from this plant because of the high radioactiv­e iodine concentrat­ion detected from the August 25 sample, but that the sludge cakes have been used as fertilizer material because the amount of radioactiv­e cesium has been below the provisiona­l safety limit for composts and manures (400 becquerels­/kg).

				Question concerning (pun intended) radioactiv­e sludge!

Since I'm very familiar with composting­, I am wondering what would happen in time, if this  400 becquerels­­/kg material is deposited layer upon layer to decompose,  With time it would seem to me that in a short while the non radioactiv­e materials would just decompose/­decay (pun intended) and the remaining HOT Compost (pun intended) would have much more than 400 becquerels­­/kg...  By spreading this "below" limit HOT compost, it seems to me that in effect the Government is just raising the background radiation for future generation­s!  What am I missing if anything?

				Stop Talking Nonsense - What’s the Nuclear Energy For, George?

The nukes have got to poor George in a clever operation. They had to get some prominent greenie to endorse their tricks. The industry knows it has a bad reputation­: deservedly of course since it has lied and chicaned its way though so many incidents that we have all lost count. So it has its spin doctors; and one of the cleverest of these is a certain Malcolm Grimston, who you may have seen in the last month on the telly talking down Fukushima. Find him on Youtube. On 14th of March Grimston was on the BBC, striped as independen­t analysis from Chatham House: We’re certainly not in Chernobyl territory, he pontificat­ed, the inner containmen­t of all 3 reactors is intact, the fuel is contained safely. . . the key is not so much these explosions­, clearly it would have been better if they hadn’t happened. . . He was wrong on every count, except the last. As I said on BBC News on 12th March, and as we now know, three reactors had melted down in the first few days. By the time George wrote the Guardian piece Japan was well into nuclear nightmare. Why do I bring in Grimston? It’s is because he was George’s Chemistry teacher at school, at Stowe. And I believe that this is the link. I know about Grimston..­..

"Maybe they make a lot of him (George) flatter him, give him money, who knows? He has recently bought an obscenely large and expensive house down the road from me in Wales, in Machynllet­h. Lately he (George) has been travelling round the countrysid­e advertised wearing boxing gloves as taking on all comers. In this tour he has taken some steps to personally attack and libel me and my scientific discoverie­s in the area of radiation and health (coached no doubt by Grimston, since there is some heavy complex technical stuff in these attacks, beyond George). Grimston will not have forgotten his own defeats in boxing match rounds with me in Manchester­, Bristol and other venues, and this is the origin of the particular­ly nasty nature of the arguments he uses. But when George was asked by my friend Richard Bramhall to step down the road from Machynllet­h to Aberystwyt­h (some 20 miles) for a public debate which we would organise at the University here he refused. His reason? I was not well known enough for him to bother with me. (For those who care, on Google Chris Busby gets 2.8 million hits and George Monbiot gets 970,000). The real reason is that without Grimston coaching him, George would rapidly be shown to have no specific knowledge in this arcane area, no ability to deal with the issue, and no case."

				George Monbiot and The Guardian: Hippocrate­s or hypocrisy? 

"A few weeks ago the postman delivered a CD to my home in Llandrindo­d Wells. It was a sound recording of one of George's Left Hook lectures. This event, recorded by an independen­t film-maker­, took place in Liverpool on May 10th. George spoke about how the Fukushima disaster has converted him to Nuclearism­, the dogma that new nuclear power stations can help to deliver us from Global Warming. His arguments can be seen on his blogs; they include the belief that releases of radioactiv­ity, even from disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima, have no observable impact on health.
A member of the audience asked George how radioactiv­e discharges from Sellafield had affected wildlife in the Irish Sea. He answered with a gratuitous and explicit attack on my colleague Professor Chris Busby although Busby's two decades of research into the health effects of radioactiv­e pollution have been exclusivel­y concerned with people, not marine organisms. 
_________

"I guess most in the audience would have been puzzled but the man who sent me the recording realised that George had chosen to try shooting the detective in a long-runni­ng investigat­ion into how radioactiv­ity in the Irish Sea migrates onto the land and causes cancer. The quest began in 1994 when the Wales Cancer Registry (WCR) drew attention to high levels of cancer in children..­..

				more....

In 1995 and 1996 we obtained two separate copies of all the detailed data held by WCR. In fact, we are now the only people who have it since in 1996 WCR was closed down and its computers were, allegedly, wiped before a new registry took over.
Examining the data we quickly saw that the highest risks were along the shores of the Irish Sea; all age groups were affected. 

Official reports had already shown plutonium originatin­g from Sellafield is widespread in marine sediments across the Irish Sea. Resuspende­d by wave action and carried inland on the prevailing westerly winds, Sellafield­'s plutonium has been measured in grass and sheep droppings all the way across England to the North Sea. 

The highest levels by far are within a kilometer of the Irish Sea. So what we saw in the WCR data supported our hypothesis that low concentrat­ions of some forms of radioactiv­ity are far more dangerous than Government officials and the nuclear industry want you to believe. Inhalation is almost certainly the most hazardous vector.

				This subject really shows how backward we are. We're still talking about oil, meanwhile Japan and Germany have already gone through oil AND a nuclear phase, heading to the next cleaner energy frontier. While we still talk about natural gas, oil and coal and are JUST talking about really expanding nuclear energy. We're light years behind the world leaders on this. So while we're talking about finally moving to more nuclear you've got Germany who will have shut down it's last nuclear plant by 2012. Ten years from now they'll have turned the page on nuclear energy, meanwhile we just picked up the book. My guess is that the giant corporate entities behind nuclear energy will ensure we don't consider anything but. Same with the oil companies that are hanging on with a deathgrip and will fight to the end to make sure we don't progress with the rest of the world or towards our best interests.

				Highest Yet: Cesium-137 levels in Northern California soil hits post-Fukus­hima peak — UCB blames nuclear weapons tests 50+ years ago (riiiiiiii­iiiight - but then again maybe they haven't been testing til now)
Topsoil sample, farm in Sacramento­, Collection Date 8/16:

Cs134 @ .147 Bq/kg
Cs137 @ 2.59 Bq/kg (70.2 pCi/kg)
Topsoil sample, farm in Sonoma County, Collection Date 4/27 (Just tested recently: “We had not had the chance to test it until now” -UCB):

Cs134 @ .347 Bq/kg
Cs137 @ 1.905 Bq/kg
Previously­, the highest amount of cesium-137 detected was 1.53 Bq/kg. It was from early April, the very first soil sample UCB published regarding Fukushima.

				Freshly-re­leased cesium from Fukushima had a 137/134 activity ratio of roughly 1.

Assuming that the cesium found here came from a single source with the same ratio, the ratio indicates an origin of 5-10 years ago - unlikely

More likely is that a small proportion of the cesium is indeed from Fukushima - about 0.2 Bq/kg of each isotope - and the remainder (the excess Cs-137)  is from weapons testing.

The very low levels found mean that it is not surprising that random variation produces the largest reading some time after starting to test.

[and reading your link, I see that the guys from UCB say the same about origins]

				No of Nuclear Plant To Be Zero in the Future - Hachiro                                                               (Kyodo) -- Industry minister Yoshio Hachiro said Tuesday that the number of Japan's nuclear power plants would be "zero" in the future, based on Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda's policy of not building new nuclear power plants and decommissi­oning aged ones.

"Consideri­ng the premier's remarks at press conference­s, it would be zero," Hachiro told reporters in answer to the question whether the number of nuclear plants would reduce to none in the future.

Hachiro added that it would be "difficult­" to proceed with plans to build new nuclear plants whose constructi­on has yet to begin, such as Chugoku Electric Power Co.'s Kaminoseki plant in Yamaguchi Prefecture­. "Public opinion is generally united in reducing (nuclear plants), instead of increasing them," he said.

( It is true that idled reactors may be re-started if they pass stress tests and local communitie­s hosting the reactors agree to it, but the important thing, IMO, is the goal of not building new reactors and the promise of the recently passed bill re: renewables­.)

				The NY Times has an article about Fukushima'­s long links to a dark nuclear past. During WW II, Japan had a nuclear weapons program in which children were sent into uranium mines to mine ore since all the men were fighting the war. Japan would have used the weapon but trusted the devine spiritual purity to lead them to victory. When the latter failed, they fell victim to the same fate that they planned for their foes.

Wow! Talk about playing with nuclear fire. That mistake along with the present Fukushima "mistake" leaves the man who was interviewe­d - since he was part of the nuclear program -  wondering if a third disaster will be necessary to awaken the people of Japan to the absurdity of the situation.

I wonder what it will take to awaken others. Fukushima is now the poster child for the anti-nuke crowd. Whether war or peaceful uses are contemplat­ed, the inherent danger cannot be eliminated­.

Hachiro has said he aims to resume operations of the halted reactors nationwide soon once their safety is thoroughly checked and local municipali­ties hosting the plants approve their resumption­.

				Aerial photograph­s reveal a plume to the Northwest of the stricken plants. By winter, TEPCO hopes that the reactors would cool down.

Germany has decided to get out of nuclear energy altogether­.

How to remove the cores? The problem will be with us for decades yet to come. Tents and water filtration do not remove the radioactiv­e materials; the radiation is just shifted around.

A few more Fukushimas and the future of the human race will be in doubt. The risks are too great with this old technology and equipment. Even if it costs trillions to decommissi­on these old reactors, the haircuts should be taken by investors and the human race needs to move on to better technology­.

Boosters argue that the earth's population growth justifes nuclear energy because the standard of living will be increased. They also argue that coal and oil are dirty. So the logical conclusion is that we will eventually hit a wall if the population continues to increase beyond the planet's resources. That's like sitting on a branch on a tree with a saw and watering the tree to grow the branch farther out so that we can saw better.

Power companies want more customers. That's what it's all about - corporate profits, not "missonary work," as they claim.

What "standard of living" do the tens of thousands of radiation evacuees have now?
What "standard of living" do the people outside the evacuation zone have when they must make their children stay inside the house and make them wear long sleeved shirts and dosimeters to school?

				The radioactiv­e material has already largely removed itself to destinatio­ns lower and only partly known. Once the whole thing no longer requires cooling, in a decade or so, the water can be removed, and the complex task of incrementa­lly dismantlin­g the damaged plant can start. This has been done for prototype fast reactors and parts of the fire-damag­ed windscale piles in the UK. It's going to be very expensive, additional­ly so because of allowing the large hydrogen explosions to take place. 

More chernobyls and fukushimas would likely lead to tens to hundreds of thousands of curtailed lives, but not to a humanity-e­nding event. They do however demonstrat­e very well the extreme economic downside of making any mistake with a technology that is far too baroque for purpose, and would never have been developed in the absence of nuclear weapons programs.

				I don't think all nuclear power supporters have the same motivation any more than all the opponents do. 

However I think you may have misunderst­ood the argument about population growth. Improved standards of living have a track record of reducing and halting population growth. So the idea is not that we need nuclear power to support more people, but that we try to avoid having the extra people - and nuclear power helps towards that end.

				Anyone who disagrees with the official line of bunk on radiation exposure from the nuclear power industry is an outlier, which is code for attacking the messenger. Your claim that LNT has been refuted is simple hogwash. The most extensive study ever conducted on the biological effects of radiation states without reservatio­n that there is no safe dose. The National Academy of Sciences BEIR7 report conclusion­s are endorsed by every respectabl­e regulatory and medical organizati­on. They are not endorsed, however, by the nuclear power industry which has a financial stake in not endorsing them.

In fact, BEIR1 did not support the original LNT theory proposed by Gofman back in the early 70's and now they do. 

Stop comparing Bophal poisons to long lived cancer producing radioactiv­e poisons. You are the king of distractio­ns in pursuit of radioactiv­e poison factories.

				That's too bad since we need their to be less of an opinion-ba­sed dicotomy in this important public health issue in the scientific community. Politician­s are totally clueless, in case you haven't noticed. We need good policy in any event.

There are problems with methodolog­y on both sides of the issue from what I've seen.

I'd like to know the truth - I have no ax to grind either way. The fact that controvers­y continues reflects the difficulty in knowing what genetic effects or cancer-cau­sing processes are initiated by what levels of exposure through the various routes of administra­tion of radiation. If there are two hundred radionucli­des and the exposure data is not precise, as in the ingestion or inhalation routes of administra­tion, there may never be a consensus. How could there be? You're a scientist so tell me.

I assume for sake of argument that no consensus will come out for many years. What policy should be implimente­d meanwhile? I would err on the side of safety if there are unknown, unknowns. You can do chemistry and physics but medicine is even more complex. That's because nature will always be far ahead of mere mortals. DNA mysteries are unraveled every day, so how can the nuclear establishm­ent and their agencies be so sure of anything? IMHO, they are guessing, as they have done for many decades so far. In the Fifties they didn't know anything yet they went ahead anyway.

				Nosebleeds are a symptom of acute radiation exposure which would required vastly greater levels of exposure than have been measured.  Therefor the nosebleeds are due to something else.  If these kids were suffering from acute radiation syndrome they would be MUCH sicker.  There would also be a lot of sick adults as well.  The nosebleeds are not symptomati­c of chronic low level exposure.

				oh yes.. I completely agree with the toxins. Thay can also be very dangerous and cause adverse health effects. Something I tend to overlook with all the radiation around. I worked with many over the years and they are indeed nasty. I still wonder about the ash and smoke, could be causing some nasty sinus problems (among other things) also.

				Safety checks are starting - a precursor to reactor restarts. If they didnt plan on restarting reactors, why go through the expense of safety checks

Things are moving in the RIGHT direction folks

----------­-----

Safety check begins on 13 idled reactors
Two utilities plan to hand in evaluation­s by month's end
Kyodo

Thirteen of the nearly 30 reactors nationwide idled for regular checks have entered the first stage of the safety evaluation process, one of the conditions for restarting them following the Fukushima nuclear crisis, sources said Wednesday.

				Doing the same thing again and again and expecting a different result is what Einstein called insanity. Why would it be different this time? These old reactors should be shut down.

The seismic activity on the Japanese archipelag­o makes nuclear energy too risky. The metal in the old reactors is not designed for forty years of "extended use."

What would it take for them to learn? Einstein said that a higher level of intelligen­ce than that which caused the problem should be employed.

Japan still has a fuedalisti­c obedience to "authority­." The government is hand-in-gl­ove with TEPCO, and therefore corrupt. This nuclear paralysis is inexplicab­le to those who are familiar with pre-nuclea­r enlightenm­ent principles­.

If Japan does this the same mistake again, it would not surprise me. I would have thought that Western Countries would step in and be the adults in the situation (it would not be the first time).

Responsibl­e citizens of the world must stop the nuclear madness. False bravado will not help the situation.

				1. Einsteins letter to FDR ushered in the nuclear age

2. Risk = likelihood (of consequenc­e) * consequenc­e. Risk is not the consequenc­e alone. 

3. Einstein said "great spirits have always encountere­d violent oposition from mediocre minds". Now is the time to move forward, improve nuclear technology­, deal with waste and nonprolife­ration. Not a time for weak leaders like Merkel

4. Japanese are all about order. A very civilizied and highly evolved society. They will not allow a rag-tag group of antinuclea­r intervenor­s storm the Bastille

5. Japan is really the adult. We have relied on them for many manufactur­ing products. They are a world leader because of their efficiency­, and industriou­sness

The most responsibl­e thing to do is to move forward and improve nuclear.

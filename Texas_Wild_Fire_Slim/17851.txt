Central Texas Fire Surrounded for NowBlaze Cancels Firefighter TributePublished : Thursday, 08 Sep 2011, 3:56 PM CDT

BASTROP, Texas - Officials say firefighting crews are making progress against a massive Central Texas wildfire and have its biggest flames surrounded. Smoldering hotspots remain Thursday across some 45 square miles blackened by the   destructive Bastrop County blaze  . But a spokesman for a team assisting the Texas Forest Service says crews have been able to tame many of the big flames. Rudy Evenson says the major concern now is wind sparking hotspot flare-ups or fanning flames outside the surrounded area.   Two people were killed in the wildfires  and nearly 1,400 homes have been destroyed about 25 miles east of Austin. About 5,000 residents have been forced to leave their homes. Neighborhoods outside the area where the fire already has burned will reopen Thursday. Evenson couldn't immediately say how many of the evacuees live in those neighborhoods.  Firefighter Tribute Canceled A weekend tribute to Texas firefighters has been canceled in Austin because the honorees are busy battling wildfires. A spokeswoman with the Texas Wildfire Relief Fund says the group's ceremony, scheduled for Sunday on the steps of the Texas Capitol, has been canceled. Kelsey Coleman told The Associated Press that the people being honored, volunteer firefighters, are working to put out wildfires. The nonprofit Texas Wildfire Relief Fund has been working to raise money for volunteer firefighters whose resources have been drained during the wildfire season. The Texas Forest Service says wildfires since November have burned at least 3.5 million acres, including destroying nearly 1,400 homes this week in Bastrop County.

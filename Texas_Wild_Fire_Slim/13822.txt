Here is a fairly long video we took today of all the devastation back off of 21 in the cardinal loop, ponderosa,cardinal drive and pine path area as of about 10am this morning. our hearts go out to those who have lost everything. The Lost Pines of Bastrop, Texas are officially lost.

That map the county posted does not﻿ show confirmed losses on cardinal and ponderosa lp and back in that subdivision which unfortunately is mostly all gone there are only a few structures left the morning we made the video provided the re-flash didn't get remaining structures.

The Tahitian Facebook page has an updated list of homes affected. They also just posted a list of all the homes they have verified that were burned﻿

If you happen to travel near Kahalulu Dr, off of/near to Tahitian drive, could you check that out? I'm all the way in Tenn, & can't seem to get﻿ in contact with the folks I know there. I hope they are alright as well as their pets, but I have a gut feeling the place is lost like all the rest of the poor folks there. Thanks

You know this is an amazing video. I have stopped and rewind many many times because this is the street my mother and father lived on for 30 years. Well today was my actual first visit back out to our homestead and I thought of your video the whole time I traveled through the burnt woods. All I can say is WOW. I am﻿ so glad that all made it out okay because it was bad. It looks like some military war back in the woods there. God bless and thank you again.

Thank you to whoever you are.... we were in limbo and still are atleast w/this video we were able to identify our property. Otherwise﻿ we would still be wondering. This has been more helpful than any official source at all. Thanks again and prayers to all affected.

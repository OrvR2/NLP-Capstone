Best 5 New-Car Deals for SeptemberBy Jim Gorzelany | Forbes – Fri, Sep 9, 2011 3:18 PM EDT





 MORE AT FORBES.COM» The Easiest Cars To Bargain For» The Best Cars For The Buck» Cities With The Worst DriversSeptember marks the official transition in the auto business from one model year to the next. Cars and trucks on dealers’ lots that were still brand-new in August suddenly become the vehicular equivalent of day-old bread. As a result, automakers’ sales incentives tend to spike each fall to help dealers clean house of what are now last year’s models.Unfortunately for consumers, a banner year for the auto industry means there are fewer bargains to go around this fall. Dealers have generally been able to clear their stocks of the most-popular 2011 models, particularly smaller and more-fuel efficient cars and crossover SUVs. You won’t find clearance sales on models like subcompact Honda Fit or Toyota Yaris, but if you have need for a larger vehicle, or one that’s being discontinued or redesigned, the deals are ripe for the picking.This month we’re highlighting the 5 model-year 2011 cars and trucks that carry the absolute richest sales incentives among all vehicles. 2011 BMW Z4Deal: $4,500 additional dealer discount and 0.9 percent financing to 36 months, 1.9 to 60 months, 2.9 to 72 months. This quick and nimble little two-seat roadster is essentially a grown-up’s toy, with svelte styling, a choice of three inline-six-cylinder engines, playful rear-drive handling and virtually zero practicality. Even though it comes with a retractable hardtop, those living in northern states will want to store it for the winter. 2011 Chevrolet Silverado/GMC SierraDeal: $4,505 cash or 0.9 percent financing to 72 months. It’s unusual to find the number-two-selling vehicle in the U.S. (the Silverado) being sold with such a generous cash rebate, but General Motors obviously wants to keep the factories humming and dealer inventories light with regard to these mechanically equivalent full-size pickups. Each pleases truck loyalists with no-nonsense styling, a smooth ride, adept handling and extensive range of V6 and V8 powertrains. Both are offered in gas/electric Hybrid versions that save a few mpg, but not enough to warrant the added cost even at today's fuel prices.2011 Cadillac STSDeal: $9,000 additional dealer discount. Larger than the more-popular Cadillac CTS, but not quite as sporty, the STS luxury sedan is being discontinued in favor of a new model, the XTS. The STS comes adequately powered by a V6 engine and offers a choice of rear- or all-wheel-drive at the same price, with assorted high-tech features available. With a little dickering and assuming the dealer’s incentive, a smart shopper should be able to shave at least $11,000 off the MSRP.2011 Lincoln MKTDeal: $1,000 cash or 0.0 percent financing to 60 months, 1.9 to 72 months and $3,000 additional dealer discount. This is essentially Lincoln’s version of the Ford Flex crossover SUV, though it features far more expressive styling. It’s adequately powered by a 3.7-liter V6 engine, but really shines when fitted with the available turbocharged “Ecoboost” version that gets equivalent fuel economy. It can seat up to seven passengers in style and comfort.2011 Chevrolet HHRDeal: HHR LS: $3,500 cash or 0.0 percent financing to 60 months, 3.9 to 72 months; HHR LT: $4,000 additional dealer discount. Chevy’s retro-styled answer to Chrysler’s PT Cruiser likewise ends its run this fall. Designed to look like a vintage Chevrolet Suburban, the compact wagon is perhaps best suited for commercial use in its two-door panel version.Full List: Top New-Car Deals For September

OK.buy .domestic vehicles ( Ford - GM - Chrysler ) as an example.....ever wonder why they are called " assembly plants " ?? Because most of the parts are built and shipped to us from many other countires..built by cheap materials & labor...who can't afford to buy them anyway !! They want us to buy the vehicle...whooppeee....what if the job you used to have making parts has gone to an offshore company...never to return ? Think about it.....lost jobs here that have gone to China....India... Mexico .....etc etc etc ............bring the jobs back to the USA put people to work who can then afford to buy the vehicle !

The first thing to look at when purchasing a new car is whether it is a company with unions.  If it is, dont buy it.  Go find a better car.

I have posted this already here before You guys should stop complaining because, one the health care we have now isn't as good as it was supposed to be. also the law has just been signed so give it some time. so if u want to say u have the right to choose tell that to ur congress men or state official. If you do not have insurance and need one You can find full medical coverage at the lowest price check search online for "Penny Health" If you have health insurance and do not care about cost just be happy about it and believe me you are not going to loose anything!

AHHHH, now we see where the biggest rip offs come from.  You can always tell who screws the public more, by the amount of discounts they come up with at the end of the year.  If they can sell them for this now, they could have done so 8 months ago.

I've owned a 2002 Cadillac STS it was nice. but a few things was wrong
1. had to use the highest price 97 octane gas at the pump. and other low octane grades the stupid computer would display engine problem.
2. one week haft of the rear trunk lid brake LED lights would not work. but the next week it would work from one side to the other side. 
3. the navi kept messing up and not go into night mode when driving at night.
4. the tire pressure check would not reset it self.
5. automatic trunk locking motor fails to pull down the trunk lid to closed all the way.
6. the automatic lumbar support motors where to loud.

So Yah that’s it.

Ok these are the things I don’t like about GM! One your paying almost $65,000 for there Cadillac band, ok
You sit in it and look all around inside the sedan or SUV depends on what your looking for in a GM.
Your saying to yourself  “oh yah I’m buying it now, look at all of the powers feature’s in it they wowing me now.” then about a month latter you realized that “what’s with the pickup headliner deal with that. I should of looked better and harder at everything on it. And I thought for $65,000 you would think GM would used alligator leather seats and headliner too with real wood and not this fake plastic wood crap. And then BMW and Mercedes has cars priced the around the same, but has 10 to 20 more power feature’s on them. SOB I made a huge mistake. 

So Yah Why pay $65,000 on the luxury band from GM but they build it perfectly and right at the end they throw in haft of the power feature’s and put in a cheap headliner from there trucks and express vans?

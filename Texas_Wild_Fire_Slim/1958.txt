What You Missed While Not Watching Last Night's Reagan Library GOP DebateTime.com - 1 hr 12 mins ago0 minutes. Presidential debates come and go. But tonight's GOP debate, the fourth in a series too numerous to bear, is a special treat. "We are all gathered under the wings of Air Force One," says NBC's Brian Williams, referring to the great phallus of American presidential might that sits in the hangar at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. No setting could be more appropriate. The camera soaks it in all 153-feet of Reagan's retired plane.

In addition to having an index and notes at the back of the book detailing who told him which details for each chapter, the lawyer turned journalist includes a section on sources, listing us in alphabetical order, followed by a separate page with job descriptions of 56 people he interviewed who requested not to be named. I mention these details to give you an idea of a) how methodical Brill is as a reporter and b) how dishy his book gets with all those unnamed interviewees. ...

Some that come to mind are great sex, true love, self-esteem and real mozzarella. The first three things I managed to find by looking hard enough, in marriage and in work. But mozzarella remains the most elusive. "I could cry salty tears; where have I been all these years?" so runs the Gershwin song, and the "salty tears" part is right on. I shed them when I first ate great mozzarella, and so did the mozzarella. ...

The law, which co-sponsor Barbara Buono, the state's senate majority leader, called "a powerful message to every child in New Jersey," is an important step forward in combating the bullying of young people. However, even before its start date, backlash was already under way. Critics say the law is too burdensome for teachers and too expensive for school districts and will spawn too many lawsuits. ...

Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in April 1995 vaporized one-third of the first and second floors, causing the seven floors above to collapse into the horseshoe-shaped vacuum that formed below. To achieve that horrific level of damage, Timothy McVeigh had simply driven up in a 24-ft. Ryder truck packed with 5,000 lb. of explosives and parked it in a loading lane on the north side of the building. The explosion killed 168 people and wounded nearly 700.

Of course, those members representing the east coast have been busy with earthquakes and hurricanes. And for those involved in foreign relations, it's been a hectic period: riots in London, a violent crackdown in Syria and the collapse of Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya. ...

Barring any late entrants into the fray, the GOP field seems set. It also seems relatively stratified. Rick Perry and Mitt Romney are poised to slug it out in the top tier. ...

He produced a movie that grossed tens of millions at the box office, was represented by one of the largest television agencies and used to be friends with well-known actors.

Bravest Remembered (from Daily News)
Comments Off






N.Y Daily News
 covers anniversary ceremony of Bravest’s Firefighter John Bellew and Lt. Curtis Meyran.
“The Last Alarm,” a poem written and read by Angela Meyran, 11, daughter of FDNY Lt. Curtis Meyran (right), who was killed in a Bronx fire a year ago yesterday:“My father was a firefighterHe rode in a big red truckAnd when he’d go to work each nightHe’d say, “Mom, wish me luck”And Dad would not come home again till sometimes the next dayA fireman’s life is easyHe eats and sleeps and playsAnd sometimes he [doesn't] fight fires for days and days and daysWhen I first heard these comments, I was too young to understandBecause I knew when the people had trouble, Dad was there to lend a handAnd my father went to work one day and he kissed us all goodbyeLittle did we know that next morning we’d all cryMy father gave his life that next day when the fire got too hotAnd we wondered why he’d risk his life for someone he didn’t knowBut now I realize the greatest gift a man can give is to lay down his life down upon the line so that someone else might liveSo as we go on from day to day and we pray to God above, say a prayer for your brothers. They may save your loved ones.”

Check Out This Little Fire Tool
1 comment






The Firefighter Trolley looks like a useful tool.  Produced in Australia and shipped anywhere this could be a very helpful piece of equipment on rural rigs or for personal use by homeowners.
Selling on Ebay.au for a little over  $1,000 Australian dollar .
(1,000. AUD = 749. USD)

The Firefighter's Camera Blog (revisited)
Comments Off






I know I have commented on this blog before but I can’t find the post.  Anyway this firefighter has a great idea.  His very small but (slowly) growing portfolio needs feeding but there is not much to document in a small town in Vermont.
Think how this would work in a city like Chicago, New York or Houston?
His blog could inspire others to do the same.  The advantages to documenting incidents are numerous.  Sometimes replaying the incident for the report is fuzzy late at night, snapping a few digital photo’s refreshes the mind.Think of the implications for training……what would we have done differently?

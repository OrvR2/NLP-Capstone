1. Mozart’s Coffee
Coffee Shops, Family Friendly, Things To Do In Austin | 3 Feb 2010

I have decided that my daily blog will be 365 unique things you can do in Austin. Each day I will tackle a different event, restaurant, concert. I have actually been making a list of things that I want to include and as the year gets underway I have no doubt that I will find plenty of other unique Austin things to include. Each Monday I will post the list of events from today through the current list.
Mozart's Coffee Austin 
I’ll start with something that can be enjoyed any day of the year but is a place I love to enjoy a warm drink or a good dessert, Mozarts. Luckily, I work two doors down so any morning that I need something to jump start my day or a mid-day snack I can run over there and am never disappointed. Truth be told, I have to say it is the great view and the overall atmosphere that keeps me going back. For me, there is something about a work view that never gets old, not to mention it is pet friendly!
Try out is this year, Mozarts, located at 3825 Lake Austin Blvd.

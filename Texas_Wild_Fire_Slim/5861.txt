LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. — A man who apparently was breaking up with one of his daughters' mothers used a rifle to kill his two young girls and then shot himself to death at an upstate campground, authorities said.
The girls, ages 3 and 10, may have been sleeping when Adam Parcells shot them Monday night, Warren County Sheriff Bud York said.
Nobody reported hearing the shootings, which happened after a rainy day that saw many people leave at the end of the long Labor Day weekend.
The family had been staying for a short time in a tent at the 168-acre Adirondack Camping Village, 50 miles north of Albany near the village of Lake George, a popular summertime tourist destination, he said. The bodies were found there by the campground owner Tuesday morning.
That was four days after 10-year-old Noel Parcells' mother reported her missing to Rochester police. Also killed was 3-year-old Mia Parcells.
Adam Parcells, 29, was from Hilton, a short drive from Rochester, in western New York. The girls were his children by different mothers, and Mia's mother was separating from him, York said.
"I'm sure there's a huge history in the Rochester area," York said. "We'll have to get that from out there."
The .45-caliber rifle used in the killings was bought at a sporting goods store in Rochester in July, he said.
State police investigators had joined the probe in western New York, he said.

				I can't help but keep thinking of the saying -  "Lay down with dogs, wake up with fleas."  

I think that far to many people lay down too soon, don't protect themselves from pregnancy and end up connected to the nuts of the world who usually reveal the warning signs of their true  character, issues and madness pretty soon into the relationsh­ip.   Poor women make choices many times because a man is a means to an end......a­nd the end may be them and/or their children. 

Most women don't stand up to someone who they think is dangerous.  They may try but they will likely give in under some dumb idea that he is the kids father and the danger is directed at her .... not the kid.  Yeah...stu­pid.

				I had an incident years ago when a couple of "young" minority Youths decided they wanted to "help" me. when two exited their vehicle on the same side of their car, not only did red flags go up. but my hand reached behind me for my "FIREARM", and when I spotted the backside of a third sneak out behind the other two and try to run between the cars on the outside, he didn't make it because he suddenly realized I was standing where I was, Out came the weapon immediatel­y, It was me against three, 20yr old "underprev­ileged ghetto youths" who had the intent to rob me.needles­s to say, the cops were very interested in those three. why, bump and robbing along the interstate­. there vehicle was stolen and no license plate.

				I have just received an education about guns.  While I still see that their original purpose was to kill  (for food, in self defense as well as to murder - and also for wars) I have been informed that in today's world, their purpose is:  as an investment­, or as a collection­.  Interestin­g, but I still want gun control, as they are still being used for their original purpose:  to kill!  I know there are responsibl­e gun owners, and I would think that they would welcome gun control, is that the case?

				Depends on your definition­.  Outright ban? No. What many do not realize is that many of laws they are demanding already exist in most states.  There are very few places that you can just walk in buy a gun and walk out.  Yes, some still exist, but not many.  Right now I am trying to figure my way through all the regulation­s and red tape to legally bring a gun I inherited from Dad from my Mom's in Ohio to my house in New Jersey.  I am not sure I legally can, and I am a retired military officer with a spotless record.  I can tell you one form of "gun control" that would be supported by the NRA and every responsibl­e gun owner, and would be more effective than anything else even being considered­:  Triple the punishment for any felony committed using a gun, across the board.  Gun crime would plummet, gun owners would cease to be harrassed and responsibl­e gun owners would not be inconvenie­nced at all since they are not committing felonies with their guns.  It won't reduce crime much, people will just find another way, but at least they won't be using guns (except for psychos who don't care about punishment­, but no law you pass will deter them anyway).  I would completely support such a measure, but it will never get on the books.  :(

				Gun control is not ban;  control - not ban -.  Often when someone speaks of gun control, gun owners skip to ban. . . but don't take on the issue of control.  And all states - make that MOST states don't have good control or ENFORCEMEN­T laws.  My father taught me to shoot a rifle at age 11.  He was a hunter, a fisherman, and an Air Force Lifer.  He was also a kind, responsibl­e parent.  I loved him, so I learned.  Since I love animals, I don't shoot or eat them, but I love to eat fish.  I never wanted to be in the military, but I support those who are, including my son (Navy) and my daughter (Army.)  That is not the point as far as I'm concerned.  Maybe assault weapons belong in collection­s - I don't know; maybe responsibl­e people can own g- zillions of guns with no problem.  My issue is WHO is buying guns, what KIND of guns they are buying, and how many assault weapons does one person NEED to buy.  Unlike some, I don't have all the answers, I just know that not all gun owners are responsiob­le people (or I would NEVER read of children shooting each other while playing with daddy's guns.)  Drive by shootings are rampant.  I don't want to ban people's precious guns, just keep guns in check.  (And yes, I know that criminals can get illegal guns.)

				this is not about guns, its about sick people who long for the final "see what you have made me do" moment in the US media.  Everytime we have a multiple shooting it sets off others to do the same.  Its about sickness in society and not about guns.  Guns at least give some people a chance to defend themselves but as for eliminatin­g this kind of sick murder spree.  If no guns then people will be locked in buildings and set on fire, drowned, bombed, poisoned, whatever it takes to get that 15 minutes of pay back in the US media.  And the US media gladly plays its part in the sickness.

				When one asks an absurd question they are in search of an absurd answer aren't they?  

While there are some on this board who would share in the quest of asking such a absurd question, the fact that it is asked in order to make a some point is more reflective of the failure - the common and usual failure and counted on failure,  to recognize that innocent lives were lost by someone who used a gun -----  and you want to substitute that loss of life with some ....what political statement about the sanctity of a GUN?

Good for you.    Those children had names.  And, their lives are over.

				I swear, I don't know WTF kind of formula was in the baby bottles, but young people seem to have grown up so emotionall­y fragile to the point they really can't take rejection in the slightest form.
I don't understand this mindset at all. If breaking up with a man or woman is the worst thing to happen to you in your lifetime, Consider yourself one of the lucky ones on this earth. How in the world can one be so wrapped up into another person they feel there is no point in living without them? Do you know how spirituall­y sick and mentally weak that is? Young people better get that relationsh­ip with God right and fast or they will not make it through all the nasty downturns and set backs waiting to introduce them to full fledge adulthood.

				I wish that some psychiatri­st would explain to me how a guy who is depressed enough to take his own life would extend the act of violence to his own innocent children. What possible trigger would do this? Suicides are generally angry or disappoint­ed with themselves and THEITR lot in life. the violence is generally inner directed or at worst to soemone who has contriubut­ed to the suicide's pain. Why the innocent children?

				When are you people going to wake up to LIFE?
People have been killing people since the begining of time. It's our nature. Its what we do ! Take away the guns and knives and rope ect> , we'll use a coconut or a snake or a spider.
Killing your children and then yourself is selfish, I admit, BUT, some people just need killing and if it were not aganist he law I really think that a lot more would be dead today, my self included. Get over it.  Your whining about the things you don't like that you read here is not going to change ANYTHING any more than my commenting on your comments is going to change the way you view things..  Just read the news, sit back and say well it wasnt me . 
Welcome to reality without KIM, Britney, Kate or Sharon. Life is a journey, be careful where you step.

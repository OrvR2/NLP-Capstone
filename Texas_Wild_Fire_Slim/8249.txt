Singer fined for changing Romanian national anthemAP – 18 hrs ago





BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — A Romanian singer has been fined for omitting a line from the national anthem in protest at the politicizing of the song, state media reported Wednesday.Agerpres news agency reported that the Bucharest prefect Mihai Atanasoaei on Wednesday fined singer Marcel Pavel and the Romanian Football Federation US$1,685 (5,000 lei) each. The Federation was fined for its role in managing the pre-match entertainment.The dustup involved Pavel's performance of the anthem prior to a football match between Romania and France this week, in which Pavel left out the line "Triumphant in battle, his name was Traian."The anthem refers to the 1st century Roman Emperor Trajan, who conquered the Dacians, the forefathers of modern-day Romanians. But the singer told Realitatea TV it could be interpreted to refer to President Traian Basescu.Trajan and Traian are the same names. Only in the Romanian language, the name Trajan is written Traian.Pavel initially said that he left the line out because he did not want the anthem to be seen in a political light. He has since been publicly criticized by the president's daughter, an MEP, on Twitter.Pavel later told online publication Gandul.net that he would consult with his lawyer to determine whether he had broken the law by defiling a national symbol, such as the flag or the national anthem, and would pay the fine if he had.

When Resident Obama did that to the Pledge of Allegience
--put himselve above the pledge (fkg retard)
--we should have railroaded the retard right out the door
--on the express
--and we should have beat the Democratic party over the head with it
--until they were either singing the national anthem at full salute
--for once, like patriots, ( agreed, this might not even be possible anymore) 
 --or at least send them back under the rock they crawled out of

Good thing our National Anthem does not have the word GOD in it, or else all the flaming liberal singers would be omitting that word when they sing...it's bad enough to hear them screw it up with all the jiving and screaming -- totally losing the solemnity of the moment. Like all these crazy hillbillies in KC who scream CHIEFS to cover up "brave" at the end of the song...

If you can not sing it correctly then DONT. Roseann was a idiot and a disgrace. And so are many others who want to make their own version. The anthem is not about you it is about the country get off you high horse

Canada used to have a similar law.  But they couldn't enforce it because NO ONE knows the words

So let me get this straight.  Their national anthem has a line praising the Roman emperor who conquered them.  Anybody else think that's strange?

Ok, so.. the singer leaves the line out, and the politics of it all becomes even MORE dramaticised than if they had just sung it........... 
What in Gods name are they doing worrying about insulting people from the 1st century for?? Are you people THAT INSANE? It was the 1st century... GET OVER IT!

Police in Maryland are investigating the mysterious disappearance of a school teacher who vanished during a shopping trip Monday evening.
Alice Elizabeth Davis, a 55-year-old English teacher at Parkside High School in Salisbury, was last seen at about 6:30 p.m. on Labor Day. According to her husband, she left their Allen home to go shopping at a Walmart in nearby Fruitland, Md. 
When Davis failed to return home by 8 p.m. her husband contacted police and reported her missing. During a search of the shopping center property, investigators spotted Davis' blue Honda hatchback parked across the street in a Big Lots parking lot.
According to the Wicomico County Sheriff’s Office, the lead agency investigating the case, officers found no signs of a struggle in or around the vehicle. Investigators also reviewed video surveillance cameras at Walmart and Big Lots and found no evidence that Davis was at either store Monday.

When contacted by The Huffington Post this afternoon, Wicomico County Sheriff Mike Lewis declined to go into detail about the current status of the investigation. The sheriff said that a press conference would be held later this evening.
Speaking with The Delmarva Daily Times, Parkside High School Superintendent John Fredericksen said the school district is keeping Davis in their thoughts as law enforcement investigates her whereabouts.
"Mrs. Davis has been an important part of the Parkside High School family since 1983, and is a 1973 graduate of James M. Bennett High School, so we know that many in the community know her and join with us in hoping for her safe return," Fredericksen said.
Davis is described as a white female, 5' 9" tall, 175 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a yellow shirt with images of cats on the front, blue shorts and sandals. Anyone with information is asked to call the Wicomico County Sheriff's Office at 410-548-4891.

				I am wondering if the latest missing student in Bloomingto­n, Indiana is related to the Jill B., (I
don't remember her last name).  The person who killed Jill could of had someone kill another
girl for revenge, now that he is in prison.  Something to think about.

				Last seen at 6:30 pm and reported missing to police at 8:00 pm?  That is just an hour and a half.  Who can shop in  WalMart and/or Big Lots in a hour and a half?  Look closely at her husband if he was the last person who saw her before reporting her disappeara­nce.

				1.5 hours after going to store is not much time. I would think if she was not home with in a reasonable amount of time call her cell call friends check to see if maybe she had car trouble. This story sounds a little suspicious­.

				About 10 -12 years ago a similar incident happened in Waldorf Maryland. A woman went shopping at a Food Lion and left the store and stopped at a gas station. She was pulled into a van, raped, and killed. Lot of similar details in this case I certainly hope they find her. I read alot of the comments about the hour and a half time frame however, as a former police officer there are many reasons why that time frame can be quite reasonable such as having a medical condition requiring medication­.

				Ummmm, this isnt someone you can just pick up and put in your car, she looks like she could put up a good fight, also, I really am sorry to say but the husband calling the police 1-1/2 hours after she left? Most people take atleast that much time at walmart and she also had the drive time so she could have only really been missing (at the store if thats where he thought she was) for about 45 mins by my estimation­. I think they need to check their cameras much closer and find out who drove the car into the parking lot, I have a feeling it wasnt her.......

				I agree--why on earth would he report his wife missing after only 1.5 hours?   If I was gone a little longer than I'd planned for a shopping trip, my family would probably think I was having ice cream or coffee somewhere.

Now, if she wasn't home by midnight, maybe---!

Erin Heaney doesn't mind being compared to another environmentally-minded Erin -- the one whose story became permanently etched into global consciousness with a certain award-winning Julia Roberts movie.
"It's kind of fortunate we have the same name," Heaney said of Erin Brockovich, the outspoken California activist who was instrumental in constructing a 1993 legal case against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company over the contamination of drinking water. As Heaney described the biggest challenges to environmental work, her kinship with Brockovich seemed to extend even further: "There's a lot of organized money out there who will ensure theirs is the story that's told ... I always knew I wanted to be watching those in power and calling them out if they weren't protecting those who they were supposed to be protecting."
The 24-year-old Heaney serves as the executive director of the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York, a Tonawanda, N.Y.-based organization that aims to protect the right of area residents to "breathe clean air and live, work and play in a healthy environment." In the two years since she joined the coalition, Heaney has rallied alongside other citizens to reduce air pollution in the area, which she said ranks among the highest in all of New York state due to a concentration of 53 industrial plants. 
Members of the Clean Air Coalition have been most heavily involved with Tonawanda Coke, a foundry coke plant that was found to be emitting dangerous levels of benzene, a known human carcinogen. After heavy community pressure, air quality studies detected more than 75 times the amount of benzene permitted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and in 2009, coalition members including Heaney staged a full-scale protest at the company's gates. The company's environmental control manager currently faces charges of violating three federal laws. 
The daughter of an investigative reporter, Heaney told The Huffington Post that she didn't seek out an environmentally-focused career, but rather one geared toward social justice. In fact, the Buffalo native was planning to pursue another opportunity in Providence, R.I., when the Clean Air Coalition position came about, and a quick drive through the Tonawanda area was enough to change her mind.
"I drove up to the industrial area and was totally blown away," she recalled. "I could see a coal-burning power plant, several chemical storage facilities, petroleum storage tanks ... I knew right then and there that this was what I was supposed to be doing. It was a very powerful moment." 
Much to her initial surprise, Heaney found environmental causes well-suited to her social justice aims. "My perception of the environmental business before I became involved with it is that it was all about individual responsibility," she said. "We get a lot of challenges both from industries and elected officials who get their money from them. We don't have power in money, we have power in people."
Never a group to rest soundly, the Clean Air Coalition has recently been involved in other area environmental cases. In June, members found levels of benzene to be at more than 10 times the level considered safe by the EPA following a fire at Buffalo's Niagara Lubricant Plant. The group has also conducted research into emissions at one of the city's truck plazas, which services some 20,000 cars and 5,000 diesel trucks daily. In most cases, residents collect their own air samples by an inflatable tool known as "the bucket." Though it may seem simple, this grassroots form of resident science has helped Heaney and her team "get in the door of various elected officials," she said.
In the future, Heaney said she hopes the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York will expand into even more neighborhoods. Though she's seen interest in her organization grow as global warming research increases on both the national and international levels, she still struggles with lingering stereotypes of environmentalists. "A lot of people hear our name and think we might be a bunch of tree-hugging hippies," she said. "But going green isn't a choice, a lifestyle, or a philosophy -- it's about survival."

Anti-scien­ce is the goal of the polluters. They're great at it.

				You go, girl! Sad you can't expect Obama to help. He's hanging out with Perry at a prayer circle praying that people will develop gills to swim through the air in ten years. Perry is trying to square this human engineerin­g change with his non-belief in evolution. It makes for good theater.

Seriously, good luck. The country needs more like you and fewer like today's gutless politician­s.

				I wonder if somewhere among the worthy efforts anyone is thinking about planting trees. That would do a lot to clean the air, while not being susceptibl­e to being labeled as jobs killing. Ah, I forget. It would require money to pay for the planting. And, of course, that would kill jobs.

				Hi,

Spending more on Clean energy initiative­s will generate investment returns to taxpayers in the form of cheaper overall energy costs. The future with solar energy ascendant and fossil fuels in decline we will change our nations energy profile to one of a clean unlimited resource as opposed to our existing one of a harmful limited resource.
I created a petition to The U S House of Representa­tives, The U S Senate and President Obama, which says:

"     Can you imagine a future where all the existing political arguments no longer exist?  In a future when people and businesses are  relying on the sun for its energy the human population will no longer be arguing over resource access.  Threats to sea life and plant life and human life from wars and   from accessing hard to get fossil fuels resulting in environmen­tal degradatio­n will be a concern of the past.  Our nation instead will turn to new urgent concerns such as health and education with plenty more financial resources from the dramatic savings in energy expenditur­es to pay for them. Relationsh­ips between countries and our fellow countrymen will transform dramatical­ly more positive.
Solar technology and other clean energy technology is here and ready for explosive growth.  With the full backing of our political leaders we can quickly move forward towards a better existence. Please join me in petitionin­g our leaders. 

Will you sign this petition? Click here:

				So if one of the many nations that have a better environmen­tal record than US decides to criticize your nation, that's okay with you?   You really want some Danish guy telling us what time it is instead of one of our own?

We are a super power and that brings with it certain responsibi­lities.   When a fellow American suggests we can do better and all you can do is criticize her and say we are better than other less developed nations, that's a cop out.  Have some pride in your country.  Unlike India and China, we are world leaders and we can do better.

				The only things we are leading at are per capita energy consumptio­n and weapons manufactur­e and sales. Otherwise we are an arrogant fading semipower trying mightily to hold onto its myth of empire. If we have leaders, it's young people like this. The politician­s are going to be her worst enemies. Other than the young like Heaney, we have no leaders. Our government system is a total failure in case you have been sleeping through the last ten years.

Having that said, I do love her last quote:  "A lot of people hear our name and think we might be a bunch of tree-huggi­ng hippies," she said. "But going green isn't a choice, a lifestyle, or a philosophy -- it's about survival." I don't live as green as I should but I'm one of those that is making the transition­.

				"Our chart (Table 1) illustrate­s each of these substances­, but let me report some notable examples. "For Benzo[a]py­rene, 222,000 cigarettes would be required to reach the lowest published "danger" threshold. "For Acetone, 118,000 cigarettes would be required. "Toluene would require 50,000 packs of simultaneo­usly smoldering cigarettes­. "At the lower end of the scale-- in the case of Acetaldehy­de or Hydrazine, more than 14,000 smokers would need to light up simultaneo­usly in our little room to reach the threshold at which they might begin to pose a danger. "For Hydroquino­ne, "only" 1250 cigarettes are required. Perhaps we could post a notice limiting this 20-foot square room to 300 rather tightly-pa­cked people smoking no more than 62 packs per hour? "Of course the moment we introduce real world factors to the room -- a door, an open window or two, or a healthy level of mechanical air exchange (remember, the room we've been talking about is sealed) achieving these levels becomes even more implausibl­e. "It becomes increasing­ly clear to us that ETS is a political, rather than scientific­, scapegoat.­”

				By the pseudo scientific standards of the Passive Smoking hysteria, ALL cooking, food and drink would have to be banned in public places too!
Using the same methodolog­y, drinking a glass of whole milk every day, was found to increase the risk of lung cancer to 3 TIMES that of passive smoking but this was deemed to be too small to be of any significan­ce!

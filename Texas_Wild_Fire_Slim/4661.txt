SAN ANTONIO -- Sticky notes with the word "photos" them now label Suzanne Rausch's cabinets. She wants her family to know exactly where the precious family photos are stored,  just in case another wildfire threatens.The Camp Stanley fire came frighteningly close to her Fair Oaks Ranch home."At the point when I saw the flames, I sprinted back to the house and started throwing things into the back of my Suburban," Rausch said.Those things included photo albums of her four children and a few family heirlooms. But documents?"That part I didn't think of at all," she said.Neighbor Rose Petroff said she grabbed her jewelry, medication and identification."My identification is my passport," she said. "I still have it in my purse, just in case."Identification is top priority when evacuating a disaster, especially one that may destroy a person's home and belongings, according to June Walbert, certified financial planner at USAA."You need identification, so that would be in the form of a passport or driver's license," Walbert said. "If you don't have ID, you can't get into your safety deposit box at the bank."While important documents like Social Security cards and real estate deeds should be stored in a safety deposit box at a bank or credit union, Walbert recommends having copies readily accessible in a fire-safe box that you can take with you in an evacuation."Anything you would put in a safety deposit box are things you should take with you," she said. "That would include birth certificates, marriage license, passports, powers of attorney and  insurance policies."Other important documents to "disaster-proof" include divorce decrees, proof of military service, medical records, car titles, financial records and last year's tax return.To streamline the paperwork, many documents and photos can be scanned and stored on a flash drive and then be accessed on a computer later.If a house burns to the ground, having certain documents readily accessible can make it easier to file for claims or benefits.One of the most important things a homeowner can do, according to Walbert, is to make a home inventory. She suggested a website www.knowyourstuff.org.While making a written and video inventory well in advance of disaster is advised, she said smart phones can come in handy."If you only have minutes to evacuate, you can use your smartphone to take video and photos, and that can save you a lot of grief down the road," Walbert said.

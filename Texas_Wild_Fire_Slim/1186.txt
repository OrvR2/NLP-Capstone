Tommy Wiseau's accidental cult hit "The Room" may be terrible, but it's successful. How many other plays-based-on-movies land premieres at the American Film Institute? As a counterpoint to our interview with the man himself, we've put together a list of equally bad movies (maybe) with devoted followings. As you click through, keep in mind: "The Room" managed comparable success with no studio backing. Eh? Impressed? He's a genius, we tell you!

				Great topic! I love "bad" movies, the more clueless non-PC the better. The first two are legit personal favorites, but great trailers all.

				I have seen far worse movies than Showgirls by people far less talented than Paul Verhoeven. When a director is that good, even his worst films are worth watching.

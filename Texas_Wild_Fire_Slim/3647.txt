my mom gave me only coffee right from my 2nd grade i guess., i didnt have any of those effects what these doctors mentioned...!

the doctors are only advising against it, because they'd rather have your kid as a zombie. my little brother took Ritalin as a child and I remember after he took it, he'd  just be like a blob. he'd start crying for no reason, too. and now, at 25, he's bi-polar, because of the Ritalin. I say GOOD FOR THIS MOM!! it takes a village to raise a child and if that village happens to be on google, so be it! I'd honestly rather take advice from another mom than a doctor!!

Oh and you know many cultures we drink a lot of tea as kids as well. Tea has so many benefits.

I have ADHD as an adult and i can tell you that coffee makes me sleepy instead of waking me up, so I use it before bed to help me wind down. Doctors are mostly all guess work and little skill. This drug didn't work here try this one and when nothing works they will say sorry can't help you live with it and move on to the next paycheck.

Good for her! All u mommy's fight back against these doctors who want to secure their personal grants from the pharmaceuticals by over drugging up your children! Why be so concerned about the caffein in coffee when kids eat chocolate bars, drink soda and drink chocolate milk all of those products are laced with  a lot of caffein. I had knee surgery 7 months ago and they kept giving me anti inflammatories that did nothing for me. After 5 months of it I threw them out in the gargabe and started drinking black and green herbal teas and it helps to smooth my achy joints. There are so many natural remedies out their that Mother Earth has to offer we don't always need a script for it. Always seek alternatives people.

Ritalin and all the other ADHD drugs ARE stimulants.  I think this is more about a parent treating on their own than an inappropriate remedy.  Seems like some doc got his nose out of joint, and is trying to make life miserable for mom...

Parents load their kids up on soda and sugary juices and people are complaining about coffee. Maybe get them off of the sugar and the chips instead.

No proof that works? It seems to help some but no all so what's wrong with trying? Is there a proof that meds work 100%? NO it works on some so final conclusion is coffee is much cheeper to try than meds do DR back off you are not going to go broke by not selling meds on behalf of drug company's there are other drugs you can promote.

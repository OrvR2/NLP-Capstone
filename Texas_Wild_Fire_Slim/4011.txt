And the agency has a longstanding history of hiring and developing quality leaders. A 17-year veteran with the agency, Davis has positively impacted the agency, its programs and its quality of service during her career. “Jan personifies quality and excellence in everything she does. We knew with all the increased national exposure she’s received in the last couple of years that others would notice --- and they did,” said Texas Forest Service Director Tom Boggus. “While we hate the thought of losing her, it is very exciting and gratifying to send another Texan to DC!”Davis, also serves as the agency’s State Stewardship Coordinator. She most recently led the development of the Texas Forest Service 2010-2015 Strategic Plan submitted to The Texas A&M University System, and coordinated the Texas Statewide Forest Resource Strategy.

Davis also has served as the point of contact for the agency’s Sunset Commission Review.  “She’ll do well at US Forest Service,” said Shane Harrington, Texas Forest Service Farm Bill Coordinator and Davis’ employee, “but it leaves a big hole in this agency – and that says a lot.” Davis begins her new position with the federal agency in September. Click here to view the USDA Forest Service announcement.

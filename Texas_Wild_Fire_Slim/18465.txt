About DRCs




A Disaster Recovery Center (DRC) is a readily accessible facility or mobile office where applicants may go for information about FEMA or other disaster assistance programs, or for questions related to your case.
Some of the services that a DRC may provide:

Guidance regarding disaster recovery
Clarification of any written correspondence received
Housing Assistance and Rental Resource information
Answers to questions, resolution to problems and referrals to agencies that may provide further assistance
Status of applications being processed by FEMA.
SBA program information if there is a SBA Representative at the Disaster Recovery Center site.

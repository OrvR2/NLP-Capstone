BUTTE, Mont. — Public school administrators in Butte went on strike after they failed to reach a contract, forcing the cancellation of classes and extracurricular activities Wednesday in the town of 34,000 people.
The school district and union are at odds over salary issues for the 15 administrators in Butte. Teachers are represented by the same union, and they honored the strike.
"The district trustees are disappointed that the union made this choice," the board of trustees said in a statement. "But, given the underfunding dilemma faced by the district, the school board strongly believes the offer made to the administrators is fair and reasonable and is also responsible to our community and its taxpayers, now and in the future."
The principals, assistant principals and directors voted last week to strike at 6 p.m. Tuesday if they did not have a contract. Administrators were seeking the same percentage raise that non-union administrators are set to receive.
"It's a question of parity," said Bill Rowe, representative for Teamsters' Union Local 2. He said the teachers would not cross picket lines.
The school district offered a 2 percent raise on administrators' base salary in addition to their guaranteed raises for experience, which would amount to at least a 4.4 percent annual raise.
The union countered last Friday with a proposal to accept a 1 percent raise for this year while maintaining their request for the 4 percent raise based on experience.
Trustees said non-union administrators, including the superintendent, are in line for a 6 percent increase once the administrators reach a contract.
Neither side had plans to bring a counter-offer to the table.
"We gave our last and final (offer) and they gave their last and final (offer)," Rowe said. "Nothing else is scheduled at present.
The strike cancelled classes at six elementary schools, a middle school and the high school.
Trustees called an emergency meeting for 5 p.m. Wednesday.

Julie Woestehoff: New Illinois Law: Education Reform or Mere Distraction?


							            							            From the way Illinois politicians have been preening the past couple of days, you'd think they had cured cancer. Nope, it's what they and the media have been relentlessly calling a "historic" new education reform law.							        



 






Jacqueline Edelberg: If Gov. Walker Thinks Wisconsin's Illinois, Dream On


							            							            The question still remains: In what backwards universe could adults allow this deplorable situation to fester?							        



 






Mike Klonsky: Emanuel's New Campaign Slogan: I'll Hammer Teachers


							            							            Rahm's solution to the city's growing educational woes after 15 years of mayoral control of the schools: Fire thousands of teachers, increase class size, make those remaining work longer hours.							        



 






Jacqueline Edelberg: Great Teaching: Not Just a Good Idea, It's the Law (Almost)


							            							            Imagine running a business with tenured employees who only need to demonstrate "competence." What would your workplace climate feel like? What kind of product would you produce?							        



 






Paras Bhayani: As Clock Ticks Down, Legislature Should Pass Teacher Strike Reform


							            							            In the waning days of the legislative session, legislative leaders are still searching for a grand tax bargain that might involve dramatic reforms to the state's education system.							        



 






Rabbi Jill Jacobs: Rabbinical School Breaks Jewish Law on Unions and Strikes


							            							            By fighting the formation of the union, and by trying to deny employees the power of striking in the future, the Schechter Institute is acting in opposition both to major halakhic authorities and to an official position of the Conservative Movement.

				What a misleading headline, insinuatin­g that it was the teachers who initiated the strike over pay when it was the administra­tors, who already make way too much money to begin with. The teachers had no choice but to honor the strike under union rules.

Now the district is being held hostage by the union over a percentage point or two and the children are the ones who pay the ultimate price for the greedy administra­tors. 

How utterly sad.

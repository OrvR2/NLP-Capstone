BASTROP, Texas (AP) — One of the most destructive wildfires in Texas history is slowing down thanks in part to calming winds, but stretched-thin firefighting crews have yet to gain any control of the blaze that is plowing across rain-starved grasslands now littered with hundreds of charred homes.Raging with zero containment for days, the wind-fueled fire has destroyed more than 600 homes and blackened about 45 square miles in and around Bastrop, a city near Austin. An elite search team on Wednesday will begin looking for more possible victims of the fire, which has killed two people and forced thousands to evacuate.Crews finally got a reprieve Tuesday from winds pushed in by Tropical Storm Lee that whipped the blaze into an inferno over the weekend. Increased humidity was moving in overnight, and officials were expected to report some containment in the morning, Texas Forest Service spokesman John Nichols said."Tonight should be a good night, tomorrow should be a good day — we hope," Nichols said late Tuesday. "The reason why it hasn't been able to be contained is the wind. We still have a lot of active fire on the line, but today was the first day we had very light wind."The blaze is the most catastrophic of the more than 180 fires that have erupted in the past week across Texas, marking one of the most devastating wildfire outbreaks in state history. The fires have destroyed more than 1,000 homes, caused four deaths and pulled the state's firefighting ranks to the limit.In a housing development near Bastrop, Willie Clements' two-story colonial home was reduced to a heap of metal roofing and ash. A picket fence was melted. Some goats and turkeys survived, but about 20 chickens and ducks died in a coop that went up in flames."We lost everything," said Clements, who with his family took a picture of themselves in front of a windmill adorned with a charred red, white and blue sign that proclaimed, "United We Stand.""This is the beginning of our new family album," the 51-year-old said.Texas Gov. Rick Perry cut short a high-profile presidential campaign trip to South Carolina to deal with the crisis, and on Tuesday toured a blackened area near Bastrop, about 25 miles from Austin. He later deployed Texas Task Force 1, the same search team sent to New York following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina."Pretty powerful visuals of individuals who lost everything," Perry said after the tour. "The magnitude of these losses are pretty stunning."The conservative Republican said he expects federal assistance with the wildfires but complained that red tape was keeping available bulldozers and other heavy equipment at the Army's Fort Hood, about 75 miles from Bastrop. The post was fighting its own 3,700-acre blaze.White House spokesman Jay Carney said the Obama administration has approved seven federal grants to help Texas with the latest wildfires.About 1,200 firefighters battled the blazes, including crews from as far away as California and Oregon. Five heavy tanker planes, some from the federal government, and three aircraft capable of scooping 1,500 gallons of lake water at a time also helped.The disaster is blamed largely on Texas' yearlong drought, one of the most severe dry spells the state has ever seen. The fire in Bastrop County is the most devastating wildfire in Texas in more than a decade, eclipsing a blaze that destroyed 168 homes in North Texas in April.At least 11 other fires exceeded 1,000 acres Tuesday, including an 8,000-acre blaze that destroyed at least six homes in Caldwell County, next to Bastrop County. In far northeast Texas' Cass County, a 7,000-acre fire burned in heavy timberland. And in Grimes County, about 40 miles northwest of Houston, a 3,000-acre fire destroyed nearly two dozen homes and threatened hundreds more.In at least one neighborhood in Bastrop, flames hop-scotched a street where houses were tucked among oaks, pines and cedar trees. The Postal Service delivered mail to burned homes where only mailboxes were left standing.John Chapman's home on about 20 acres was only singed and had some smoke damage, but the vintage-car collector lost about 175 vehicles he kept in a garage or under pole barns. His losses included about a dozen Corvettes and a Shelby Cobra.As ashes swirled and tree stumps still spit flames, the 70-year-old Chapman pointed out the melted remains of a 1966 Pontiac GTO, a '57 Chevrolet pickup and a 1947 Studebaker pickup, and said: "You can either laugh or you can cry. You might as well laugh.""The house is safe, my wife and I are alive and good, and I'm not going to worry about it," he said.About 40 people who fled their homes were staying at a community center in the town of Paige. A volunteer, Debbie Barrington, said some people have been sleeping outside on picnic tables under a pavilion, eating food and using toiletries donated by folks not hurt by the fires."The first night, we had a child 17 months old," she said. "We didn't have milk. The next morning, I think we had eight gallons. People heard what we needed and brought it in. The response has been unreal."___Michael Graczyk reported from Houston.

So Texas is burning. I wonder if rick perry brought in hell as a new industry.

Racist Texas! Perry should be there praying for Texas instead he´s manure talking. Now Perry will blame it on the campers and camp fires. Texas belongs to God just as the earth does. Texas is not exempt from the Wrath of God. The Group of Poop should have been used instead of the toilet paper and garbage.

Rick Perry is more concerned about running is manure lying mouth than to be worried about Texas burning.....let it burn, burn, burn. The Wrath of God abides with Perry! Get the Rich and Super Rich pay to have it put out.

Rich Perry doesn't need any help! What a well deserved slap in his smegma face! Get the rest of the Group of Poop and Tea party garbage to go put out the fires they are worthless at anything constructive.

Let manure talking Rick Perry to use his manure talking mouth to put out the fire. Let the rich and super rich pay to have it put out.

Fires out yet? Whaddayamean you teabaggers dont have the fire out yet? 

Tax cuts didn't put it out? Small government didn't put it out? Calling people libtards didn't put it out?

Can't you do ANYTHING without Obama's help?

Texans pay federal taxes like everyone else in fact they probably pay more than most and if they need some help to quickly contain the fires it should have come! Texas has been burning for about a year with No help from Obama this will be his Katrina.

As you read this Texas is burning to the ground.
As youi read this there are firefighters who are underpaid and underfunded working, sweating, dying in a futile attempt to extinguish these fires.
As you read this the republican dominated state of Texas government is doing NOTHING about this problem either for the present... OR the future.

You see the obscenely rich oil people who have benefitted from the tax cuts don't live in Texas. BP is British. Shell is Dutch. They don't have to worry about getting burned. That's for those dirty poor Texans.

Governor Rick? He has ambitions that don't include Texans. He's going to be president and help the foreigners suck ALL the money out of the entire country.

I am always amazed how callous and just plain ignorant comments can be when a tragic event occurs. Stupid is as stupid says!

The problem with all you stupid, overly political dumb fucks is that you only see this as one-sided. You can bash a state and a person. You want my home and my education to burn down, you call Texas' governor the Devil and bash him for being racist or stupid, and you have the audacity to comment on matters you're obviously oblivious about.

I just hope when your state gets hit by a tornado or hurricane or flood or wildfire, that you receive the same respect for your state and governor and your OWN HUMAN LIFE as you've given the people of Texas.

Most of my life has been spent in Texas, and to be frank, it's not the greatest place on earth. Despite ANYONE'S opinion on the state or it's legislature, human lives are at stake. Maybe if the shoe were on the other foot, if your life, your home, and your career were at stake, just MAYBE, people would realize how valuable life is and how much just a little support or a "God bless you" can go.

If you feel like posting about how screwed up a state is, there's Twitter, Facebook, and I'm sure an anti-Texas web site or two out there. If you feel like actually considering a human life or have something relevant to say, this could be the place.

God bless the Bastrop area citizens and the fire fighters working to save lives and attempting to stop this destruction before it harms anything more. Too bad most people who call themselves Americans today can't show the slightest bit of respect.

God is punishing Texas for being racist. Perry, instead of praying for America, get on your knees and pray for Texas.

f***king amazing how you people get off track and turn texas wildfires political. we have been in drought conditions for a year now. then this wind and more dry air blow through on a holiday weekend (carrless smokers or campers no doubt) and the blaze is on. I comend perry for coming back and doing the right thim to get it handle and get recovery on the way. some people have lost everything by no fault of their own and the task team is now searshing for those that did not escape. in reference to politics... stop bitchin and moanin and start keeping your eyes and ears open to find the best guy (president ) for the job. obviously it wasn't obama. not that our choices were anygood anyway

Hello my name is Rick Perry and I'm a dumb white guy.
My state I can't appriciate so why do I even try?
I dump my tea, but I'm still GOP, but maybe next week I'll change my mind.
I can take the heat cause I suck of the teet off the ignorantly and blind.

The state, the state, the state is on fire.
The state, the state, the state is on fire.
Perry don't want no water, so let that mother f'u'c'k'e'r BURN.
BURN mother f'u'c'k'e'r BURN!

all because of one lazy camper who decided to burn his toilet paper rather than bury it with the rest of his camping litter. Folks, DON'T just light your camping garbage on fire and walk away.

Its scary, there is smoke outside my house, people have died and many many homes have been burned. To make it worse the people I would expect to have compassion have none. Austin is one of the bluest cities in the country.

This amazes me, people are losing their homes, animals are dying and crops are burning yet instead of showing sympathy, you ignorant people more than likely from the Midwest and North are bashing Texas and bad-mouthing Perry?  What happened to all you people? Didn't you get enough hugs when you were babies or were your parents just as ignorant as you are?

The tea bagger is going to take a government hand out? Typical, socialism is what they call helping others, not when it helps them.

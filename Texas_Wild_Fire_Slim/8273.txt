Unique Roman gladiator school unveiled in AustriaBy GEORGE JAHN - Associated Press | AP – Mon, Sep 5, 2011

PETRONELL-CARNUNTUM, Austria (AP) — They lived in cells barely big enough to turn around in and usually fought until they died. This was the lot of those at a sensational scientific discovery unveiled Monday: The well-preserved ruins of a gladiator school in Austria.The Carnuntum ruins are part of a city of 50,000 people 28 miles (45 kilometers) east of Vienna that flourished about 1,700 years ago, a major military and trade outpost linking the far-flung Roman empire's Asian boundaries to its central and northern European lands.Mapped out by radar, the ruins of the gladiator school remain underground. Yet officials say the find rivals the famous Ludus Magnus — the largest of the gladiatorial training schools in Rome — in its structure. And they say the Austrian site is even more detailed than the well-known Roman ruin, down to the remains of a thick wooden post in the middle of the training area, a mock enemy that young, desperate gladiators hacked away at centuries ago."(This is) a world sensation, in the true meaning of the word," said Lower Austrian provincial Governor Erwin Proell.The archaeological park Carnuntum said the ruins were "unique in the world ... in their completeness and dimension."The gladiator complex is part of a 10-square kilometer (3.9-square mile) site over the former city, an archaeological site now visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists a year. Officials told reporters they had no date for the start of excavations of the school, saying experts needed time to settle on a plan that conserves as much as possible."If one has a major injury then you first do a series of CT scans before you let a surgeon do his work," explained Wolfgang Neubauer, director of the Ludwig Bolzman Institute, which participated in the discovery.Digging at the city site began around 1870, but only 0.5 percent of the settlement has been excavated, due to the enormity of what lies beneath and to the painstaking process of restoring what already has been unearthed.Virtual video presentations Monday of the former Carnuntum gladiator school showed images of the ruins underground that morphed into what the complex must have looked like in the third century.It was definitely a school of hard knocks."A gladiator school was a mixture of a barracks and a prison, kind of a high-security facility," said the Roemisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum, one of the institutes involved in finding and evaluating the discovery. "The fighters were often convicted criminals, prisoners-of-war, and usually slaves."Still, there were some perks for the men who sweated and bled for what they hoped would at least be a few brief moments of glory before their demise.At the end of a dusty and bruising day, they could pamper their bodies in baths with hot, cold and lukewarm water. And hearty meals of meat, grains and cereals were plentiful for the men who burned thousands of calories in battle each day for the entertainment of others.Thick walls surround 11,000 square meters (13,160 sq. yards) of the site, and the school and its adjacent buildings stretch over 2,800 square meters ((3,350 square yards).Inside, a courtyard was ringed by living quarters and other buildings and contained a round, 19-square meter (23-square yard) training area — a small stadium overlooked by wooden seats and the terrace of the chief trainer.The complex also contained about 40 tiny sleeping cells for the gladiators; a large bathing area; a training hall with heated floors and assorted administrative buildings. Outside the walls, radar scans show what archeologists believe was a cemetery for those killed during training.The institute said the training area was where the men's "market value and in end effect their fate" was decided. At the same time, it gave them a small chance for survival, fame, and possibly liberty."If they were successful, they had a chance to advance to 'superstar' status — and maybe even achieve freedom," said Carnuntum park head Franz Humer.___George Jahn can be reached http://twitter.com/georgejahn

That is why women should run the world.  What mother would delibretly start a war and send her child out to die,  or train her children to fight to the death for the entertainment of blood thirsty people.

CAGE FIGHTING and Gladiator Sports are only for #$%$39;s and Obama Commie Supporters. This is a disgrace both for Christianity and America. As a child I lived in a brutal violent neighborhood and I had to fight my way to school and back each day and it scarred me for life. Fighting does not prove anything, it only shows that you are faster or maybe stronger, but in the real world, seeing someone die with their throat cut is not romantic or great, it is sad to watch people die so quickly and without any reason. You begin to understand that without Christianity Mankind becomes a beast very quickly!

Romans were an immoral race of people back in the day.  With the way part of our society is going now in the USA, the Romans back then would fit in good here.
Who knows what else will be uncoverd.  It will be years before they get all that work done.  Hope to see more pictures.

We get it people, there are a lot of bigots out there.  We know you're there, you don't have to make your presence known on every single subject matter.

So as you can all see, blacks were not the only slaves throughout world history. Whites were slaves too. Blacks get over it and get on with life.

People say that the ancient Romans were so much more brutal and barbaric than we are today.

But look at the movies we watch. Look at the kind of entertainment we enjoy. People flock to see movies with death, blood, and guts as much as the ancients flocked to see gladiatorial battles. Are we really any better than them just because we have the technology to simulate what they couldn't?

These were brutal people in a brutal society. Imagine taking the family down to the coliseum for some good old fashioned murder, blood thirsty sweaty murder. I wonder how well the refreshments sold at these events? It's hard to imagine how people could actually be so cruel to one and other for sport. This was to the death by the way! Just a brutal society, it's a good thing their way of life didn't last.

Don't forget, the Roman empire COLLAPSED. First it became an empire by military aggression. Then it became degenerate, rotten and corrupt on the inside. Then it collapsed.

What is wrong with peopl?  That was when people were not so civilized.  It seems not much has changed.  Except now we send our best young guys to fight and not our prisoners.  Why can't we just stop fighting.  God did not/does not want his people in war.  It is greed and selfishness that make wars.

Gladiators are weak, slow, pathetic. A martial arts master..would put these fools to their death very quickly. Some people argue gladiators fight to the death so they will win against a martial arts master. A martial arts master who fights to the death is also deadly since he will take the quickest route to end the gladiators life. With both fighters fighting to the death, my votes on the martial arts master. He has superior speed, counter offense, precision deadly strikes. The gladiator have no chance. The Gladiator movie is a bit exaggerating, they made these gladiator have eyes behind their heads, so fake. Like all the Rambo movies hollywood spits out.. Rambo rescue POW's from Charlies camp while trying to escape from more than a dozen Viet soldier firing AK-47's from every direction. Somehow none of these bullets even touch this fool. My point is ...the Gladiator film is exaggerating on how skillful these fighters are.  Anyways..Bruce Lee will kick any UFC fighters anyday. The first kick will be the death kick.

The Roman Empire lasted over 600 years, some say 700 depending....  before it collapsed in on itself.  How are WE doing at 235?.... Broke, over extended military, deeply in debt... declining productivity... failing natural resources... deep divisions in government.... lack of direction... elitism... crumbling infrastructure... The parallels are scary.

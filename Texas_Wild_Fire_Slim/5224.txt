China's Xi confident of US economic strengthBy JOE McDONALD - AP Business Writer | AP – Fri, Aug 19, 2011

BEIJING (AP) — China's vice president expressed confidence in American economic strength as he and visiting U.S. Vice President Joe Biden met Friday with corporate executives from the two countries.Biden's visit is aimed at learning about Vice President Xi Jinping, who is expected to become leader of China's ruling Communist Party next year. But it has been overshadowed by U.S. economic uncertainty and Beijing's anxiety about the safety of its vast holdings of Treasury debt."The U.S. economy is highly resilient and has a strong capacity to repair itself," Xi said at a round-table meeting with businesspeople. "We believe that the U.S. economy will achieve even better development as it rises to challenges."The meeting was aimed at enhancing cooperation amid complaints by foreign companies about Chinese market barriers and by Beijing about U.S. export restrictions. It included executives of General Motors Co., Coca Cola Co., Caterpillar Inc., Bank of China Ltd., computer maker Lenovo Group and appliance brand Haier Group.Biden acknowledged China's complaints about the difficulty of obtaining U.S. visas and noted foreign unhappiness about limitations on access to its markets, saying, "changes need to take place here in China as well."During the meeting, officials and businesspeople discussed complaints by companies from both countries about access to each others' markets, said Richard Lavin, group president for Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar. He said the atmosphere was "very positive" but declined to give details of comments by Xi and other Chinese officials."We talked about restrictions inside China that make it problematic for U.S. investors," said Lavin. "U.S. representatives made commitments about continuing to open the United States to Chinese investment."China's rapid economic growth and rising military might have led both sides to call for better communication to solve issues that could flare into bigger problems and cooperation on issues including the economic crisis and the environment.On Thursday, Biden expressed the "fond hope" the trip would lead to stronger personal relationships with Chinese leaders.On Saturday, Xi and Biden travel to Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, which suffered a massive earthquake in 2008. Biden will speak to high school students Sunday and visit quake reconstruction projects.Beijing has appealed repeatedly to Washington to avoid taking steps in response to its economic malaise that might weaken the dollar or erode the value of China's $1.2 trillion in Treasury debt and other U.S. assets.Ahead of Biden's arrival, state media carried comments by Chinese analysts appealing to Washington to avoid further stimulus moves by the Federal Reserve and to protect foreign investors in the United States.Before the start of Friday's meeting, the president of Bank of China expressed hope for a stable dollar. He said 57 percent of the bank's $200 billion in foreign holdings is in dollar-based assets."We hope the U.S. dollar will remain stable," Li Lihui told reporters. "We are a little bit concerned, but we are confident that the U.S. government can solve its economic problems."___Associated Press writer Christopher Bodeen contributed.

The Chinese and India have stolen all US jobs 

The US shot itself in the foot by allowing the jobs to leave in the first place.

Sometimes gains in the short term are not worth the pain in the long term.

I'm sure Biden's trip was nothing more than visits to some strip joints, tequila and some wild partying.

But hey whatever gets the job done. The Chinese sound much more positive after his visit for some reason.

Good for Xi.  Now try convicing those who live here.  When he said he was confident, I think hopeful would be a better take.  Probably some difficulty in the translation.

It's inevitable that we go to war with this country and win big.  They fear us... trying to stall for time while they build up their petty arsenal.  It'll only take a few nukes and we can wipe them off the face of this planet.

In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.

Good to see two leaders of the 2 most biggest economy body meet and discuss.

Trade make win win for both country. It is sad and unforturnate to see many used hate and bias viewpoint to politize, to demonize the visit China. To politize and demonize Product that are Make in China. 

1st, Make in China product are cost effective and many are in good quality.

2nd. US down or China up is not a zero sum game..each have independent casue and reason..

30 years of continue improvement and reform has landed China the 2nd economy body. 1.3 billion people out of poverty. That is result of hard work and right vison of the Chinese leader and hardwork of the people. It has nothing to do with anyone sold out anything from US.

The bad position that US is in has nothing to do with China.but has everything to do with those politician in DC, special interest of oil and weapon makers, Iraq wars, remember AAA graded poison bond from wall street? QE1, QE2?.. US exproting of debt, printing dollar as man as toilet paper that bring down dollar, that cause world width inflation. It is all rooted and made in USA. Can't blame on this.

Forward looking, work together to build a better world, better future for all.

Stop the bias, Stop using communist to discriminating, and demonize China, as it is not. Go visit to find out.

Sad to see how our country has gradually sold out to the communist Chinese. Think about it we have propped them up by spending trillions at Wal-Mart/Target with their inferior products over last 20 years. We buy their crap because its so cheap and they don't buy a #$%$ thing from us except our debt which they have done by design in order to balance the fact their military cannot match ours but that day is also coming to an end. Keep kissing their #$%$ Biden you snake in the gr#$%$

"We hope the U.S. dollar will remain stable," Li Lihui told reporters. "We are a little bit concerned, but we are confident that the U.S. government can solve its economic problems." Please tell me he did not say this with a straight face. If he did, that would be one of the best lie of all time.

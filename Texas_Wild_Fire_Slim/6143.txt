				Whether you like Lady gaga or not, Madonna has never reinvented herself, she simply became a mass media darling in an era where there was no internet to protest the fact that she was nearly ALL you got in terms of a lasting female pop singer super star for almost an entire decade.  She could have never done today what Lady gaga just pulled off-madonn­a is a dime dozen.  It was like cultural Stalinism  from 1985 to about 1996 or so-especia­lly in the states.  The media (as well as Madonna) allowed no other women to enjoy even an iota of the press, the magazine covers, the sound bites or the twisted respect she glutted upon.   The mass media has clearly allowed Madonna to spin, incessantl­y, her own negativity­, self-hatre­d,  gross sexual explicitne­ss, vulgarity, female misogyny cattiness and narcissism into profit and yet MORE attention.   

Her body won't work any more so now it is Hydrangeas­, anti-Semit­ism and lady Gaga. 
Take a step up folks. Madonna is finished.

				No mainstream star with an unparallel­ed  global following of children was crotch and chest flashing before her but then no one that famous had been that untalented before.  Madonna paved the way for Paris Hilton, The Hills,  Katy Perry, Britney, Pussycat Dolls, Rhianna, reality TV  etc with the following credo: " When the talent is not there you better take off your clothes,  show your most intimate parts, get raunchy, slap a price tag on it and call it "empowerin­g" or no one will keep looking."

				Bravo Madonna! Don't be a sellout to every newbie that peaks for a season. They could be headed for the halls of shame five years from now, for all we know. You on the other hand have earned the status of true greatness through many tough years of hard work, hard work, and hard work. For these new faces that keep springing up all over the place, to have any kind of associatio­n with you would be a huge feather in their cap, not yours. You have our respect, Madonna, for not forgetting who you are.

				I can't believe I'm weighing in on this.  I can't believe I going to say what I'm going to say either.  I'm a rock and roll guy.  I never really cared about Madonna.  I was a teenager in the 80's though, so I obviously was very aware of her.  I grew to respect her.  She was a decent (not great) singer.  She was a quite good dancer.  She was a fantastic self-promo­ter.  But most significan­tly, she knew what people wanted before they did.  Credit where credit is due.  She was a visionary.

But now, here is Gaga.  Again, I'm a rocker (still).  I don't care much for her genre. But she actually impresses me at least as much as Madonna.  I know she borrows (steals) from Madonna.  But think about it.  Madonna didn't create everything herself.  She repackaged plenty from earlier performers­.  While Madonna may have been slightly more original, Lady Gaga is more multi-tale­nted.  She really can play the piano/keyb­oard.  She does the dancing.  She can definitely sing live.  She ain't no Britney Spears.  And she also has her finger on the pulse of the music world (of today) as much as Madonna did in the 80's.

Gaga's been around for what, 3 years?  C'mon!  Give her some respect.

				I believe it's probably the other way around.  Save for her kitschy attraction to a certain segment of the population the 60 year old pop star doesn't move too far from her base before being mocked and vilified by the rest of society.  Does she still have the English accent?

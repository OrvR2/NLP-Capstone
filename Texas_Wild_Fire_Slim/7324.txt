As Hurricane Irene swept through the Caribbean on Tuesday, residents along the East Coast of the U.S. braced for the storm. Forecasters predict Irene could strengthen into a Category 4 storm by the weekend. The hurricane has already caused damage across the Caribbean, including parts of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. 
The Associated Press reports:
People stocked up on food, boarded windows and gassed up their cars Tuesday as Hurricane Irene threatened to become the most powerful storm to hit the East Coast in seven years.

Water, bread and batteries disappeared from store shelves. Lines formed at the pump. From Florida to Maine, residents were told to brace for flash flooding and power outages.
Don't miss this NASA photo of the storm, shot from the International Space Station.
Let us know if you're preparing for the storm by taking the poll below the photos.

BASTROP (September 11, 2011)--The number of homes destroyed by the massive wildfire raging east of Austin rose to 1,554 Sunday and officials say 17 people are unaccounted for in the wake of the blaze.
Bastrop County Sheriff Terry Pickering said Sunday the missing people could simply be out of town, but authorities have been unable to contact them.







Officials earlier estimated the fire destroyed 1,400 homes, but county emergency management director Mike Fisher says the number of homes destroyed is expected to rise further as officials enter more areas where the fire has been extinguished.
The fire in Bastrop erupted a week ago when blustering winds whipped up by Tropical Storm Lee blew over parched, drought-stricken Texas. 
It’s the largest of more than 190 raging throughout the state.
Evacuees displaced by the wildfire are applying for vouchers to pay for hotel rooms as they await word on when they can return to their homes, or what’s left of their homes.
Shelters set up for the evacuees began offering the vouchers on Saturday. 
At one of the shelters, Celebration Church, a nondenominational church outside Bastrop, a steady stream of displaced residents filled out applications.
Several displaced residents who were applying for the vouchers said they were already staying at hotels but needed financial help to pay for their hotel bills.
Gov. Rick Perry's office said the Texas Disaster Relief Fund, a nonprofit organization, is providing funding for the vouchers.
Perry's office said residents have to go to one of the shelters to apply for the vouchers.

HOW CAN I TELL IF MY TREES HAVE OAK WILT?

The most reliable characteristic for diagnosing oak wilt in the field is what is called “veinal necrosis” of the live oak leaves. Apparently veinal necrosis only occurs on live oak. Symptoms on other infected oak trees are less distinct. Laboratory culture of the fungus is another way to confirm the presence of oak wilt. Veinal necrosis is characterized by chlorotic (yellow) veins that eventually turn brown. The leaves will fall from the tree and dead leaves with brown veins can be found on the ground under the tree.
Live oak trees infected with oak wilt usually die within two to four months. Adjacent trees begin to drop their leaves and die a few months later as the disease progresses from tree to tree through the interconnected root system.
Infected red oak trees don’t exhibit distinct symptoms. Leaves often turn pale green then brown and usually remain attached to the tree for a period of time. This can begin on one branch and quickly engulf the entire tree. Trees generally die within two to four weeks.

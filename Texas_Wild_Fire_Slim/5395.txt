Top Al Qaeda ops chief killed in Pakistan, US saysBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Sat, Aug 27, 2011

Atiya Abd al-Rahman (State Department)A senior al Qaeda operations commander, Atiyah abd al-Rahman, has been killed in Pakistan, the Obama administration said Saturday.
"It's been confirmed that al Qaeda's number two, Atiyah abd  al-Rahman, was killed earlier this week in Waziristan, Pakistan," a  senior U.S. official told the Envoy Saturday by email, describing  Atiyah's death as "a tremendous loss for al Qaeda, because [Osama bin Laden's successor Ayman al-] Zawahiri was  relying heavily on him to help guide and run the organization,  especially since Bin Laden's death."
According to the senior U.S. official, Atiya, who was born in Misrata, Libya in 1970, was killed on Aug. 22. The Associated Press reported that Atiyah was killed in a U.S. drone strike that occurred in Waziristan on Aug. 22, although U.S. officials would not confirm how he was killed.
American officials described Atiyah Saturday as the "number 2"  official in al Qaeda after the killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. Navy  Seals in Pakistan in May.
However, Washington Post intelligence columnist David Ignatius, writing in a column Aug. 23--one day after the Aug. 22 strike that killed Atiyah, but several days before U.S. officials confirmed the news--said that U.S. officials believe, based on documents seized at bin Laden's compound, that Atiyah may effectively be more important than Zawahiri. "Indeed, because the Libyan-born Atiyah . . . was the boss's key link with the outside,  officials see  him  as more important than bin Laden's nominal successor," Ignatius wrote.

"The trove of materials from Bin Laden's compound showed clearly that Atiyah was deeply involved in directing al Qaeda's operations even   before the raid," the senior U.S. official told the Envoy. The official asked for anonymity to discuss  intelligence issues. "He had  multiple responsibilities  in the organization and will be very  difficult to replace."
Counterterrorism experts say that regardless of his ranking in the al Qaeda hierarchy,  Atiyah clearly played a key role as a communications hub between different nodes of the al Qaeda network, including between the now deceased bin Laden and former leader of al Qaeda in Iraq.
In 2006, the Washington Post reported that U.S.  military officials had obtained a letter apparently written by Atiya to  the then leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, in December  2005. Zarqawi was killed in June 2006.
In the letter to Zarqawi, dated Dec. 11, 2005, "Atiyah bemoans the  difficulty of direct communications between  Waziristan and Iraq and  suggests that it is easier for Zarqawi to send a  trusted representative  to Pakistan than the other way around," the Washington Post's Karen DeYoung wrote.
"Unable to operate in camps any longer, core al-Qaeda depends on  communication between key nodes," said counter-terrorism analyst Brian Fishman, of the New America Foundation, in an email to the Envoy Saturday. "Atiyah was central to those  communications and he has now been removed."
However, while his killing is "another blow to al-Qaeda's  organizational capacity," Fishman added, it will "not necessarily  disrupt its operational capacity."
The U.S. Treasury Department only last month formally designated Atiyah  as a member of an al Qaeda logistical support cell whose leader, it said, is based in Iran.
The State Department Rewards for Justice program had offered  $1 million for information leading to Atiyah, who it described as an explosives expert and Islamic scholar in regular contact with senior al Qaeda leaders, including bin Laden and Zarqawi. State officials also said he is a member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group--a faction that has joined forces with the rebels fighting against Moammar Gadhafi.
"Atiyah joined the now deceased Usama bin Ladin in Afghanistan as a  teenager in the 1980s," the State Department's reward listing said. "Since then, he has gained considerable stature in  al-Qa'ida as an explosives expert and Islamic scholar. Atiyah became  acquainted with al-Zarqawi in the western city of Herat in the late  1990s. He retreated with the now deceased Usama bin Ladin to the  mountainous Afghanistan-Pakistan border region in the fall of 2001."

Do you cheerleaders understand how many "#2's" we have killed since 9/11.  Then there are the "#1's" of each other country such as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al Qaeda's "#1" leader in Iraq who led a bloody insurgency of suicide bombings and kidnappings, and was killed in an airstrike north of Baghdad in 2006 and list goes on and on.  You never heard of this guy before but you all are acting like we just took out Iran president Ahmadinejad.  Guess what, there is a new #2 in place already today!   We have an entire facility full of these guys,  it is called GITMO where BTW we got the information needed to finally take out all of these losers now in Pakistan.

One more thing Lakemonster, you say "praise the Lord" yet you celebrate the killing. That is in direct opposition to the Lord's ten commandments. It is interesting you would praise the Lord for a president and/or opperatives that have broken one of the ten commandments... "Thou Shall Not Kill"

For the record, I am not disagreeing with the execution of the plan, or the man, but I do find your stance a strange juxtaposition of reasoning and praise.

Way to go lake monster!!! Don't discuss issues, don't use facts, just insinuate what you mean! AT least Joe Biden had the courage to say in no uncertain terms what you are saying, that you think the republicans are terrorists. Well, as a republican, I say you are a hypocrit. The liberals, especially the liberal leaders got all upset over some wording of some more right wing conservatives than I, and asked that all rheteroric be toned down, but I see you are a total failure in trying to implement that strategy. Instead, you just call names... nope sorry, you insinuate the name calling, and I can only derive that the reason is you lack the courage to say what you think.

And if you have ever read my comments before, you would know that I say when people resort to name calling, insulting, and skirting the issues for just attacking the person/people, it just means the attacker is out of intelligent things to say. Since I never saw any intelligent, issue driven comments first, I am left thinking you never actually had anything intelligent to say to begin with.

Now before you get your panties in a wad and say I did what I am saying you did, please notice I used facts of your posts as the substance of my reply, so I did address the issues, even though I have to admit, I did insult you!!! I just did it intelligently!!! LMAO

Is there a possibility of droning the neo-nazi Republicans by any chance Mr. President? They have the same agenda as Al-Qaueda. Thank you Mr. President.

Fine that he's dead...but I think caution is needed when describing someone as an "Islamic" scholar.  Are Sarah Palin or Michelle Bachmann "Christian scholars"?  Loose use of language perpetuates stereotypes which are being used in the US by certain circles as "evidence" equating all Muslims with terrorism when in fact it's a handful of loose nuts like Al Quaeda who are hardly recognized by reputable Muslim organizations as viable spokespersons for Islam.

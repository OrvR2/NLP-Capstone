Missing B.C. boy's home left unlocked before mysterious return: fatherBy The Canadian Press | The Canadian Press – Mon, 12 Sep, 2011

Hebert disappeared …Article: Randall Hopley arrested on kidnapping, child abduction chargesThe Canadian Press - 7 hours agoArticle: Alberta Mounties study social media policyCBC - 20 hours agoArticle: Father in B.C. abduction case criticizes courtsCBC - Tue, 13 Sep, 2011

SPARWOOD, B.C. - Just how three-year-old Kienan Hebert was brought back to his British Columbia home undetected in the dark of night may have a deceptively simple answer: the doors were unlocked.Kienan was returned to his family home in Sparwood, B.C., early Sunday morning nearly a week after he disappeared from the very same two-storey house.The house was unoccupied at the time, with Kienan's large family staying a few doors down, and just hours earlier, the boy's father made an emotional plea for whoever had his son to leave him in a safe location.The sudden turn of events raised immediate questions about how a kidnapper could enter the home undetected for a second time, but on Monday, Kienan's father Paul offered the explanation."We left the doors unlocked on purpose," Paul Hebert, sounding exhausted but relieved, said in an interview."We asked him to bring him back to a safe place, and he brought him back to our house."Hebert declined to say whether he left the doors unlocked on the advice of police.The sole suspect in Kienan's disappearance remains convicted sex offender Randall Hopley, 46, who was still at large. Police and the Heberts have publicly urged Hopley to turn himself in.Kienan hadn't been seen since last Tuesday, when his parents put him to bed for the night. By Wednesday morning, he was gone, prompting a massive search of the surrounding area.By the end of the day, the RCMP had determined Kienan may have been abducted and issued an Amber Alert, asking the public to be on the watch for Hopley's car and a little boy wearing Scooby Doo shorts. The alert spanned several days and was eventually expanded into Alberta.On Monday, Hebert said his son — one of eight children — was coping with the ordeal and appeared to be OK."Other than the personal invasion, being taken away in the middle of the night, nothing," Hebert said when asked whether his son was harmed."Kienan's still a little bit offset. If you're a stranger, he won't come and talk to you. But he's doing really good; he's happy to be home."The case has prompted public debate about two aspects of the police investigation: whether the Amber Alert was issued soon enough and how the abductor could have evaded police to return Kienan home.Hebert said he was confident the RCMP did all they could and credited the force for Kienan's safe return.He saved his criticism for the courts, which he said failed to intervene as Hopley's criminal record grew, including at least one case involving a child."The judicial system that didn't correct Hopley to begin with, they invaded our rights," said Hebert."The judge let him walk with no help. That's what failed: The system. Mr. Hopley needs help and the judicial system failed him, and in doing so failed us, as well."Hebert didn't specify which case he was referring to, but Hopley has numerous convictions spanning two decades.In 2008, Hopley pleaded guilty to break-and-enter and was sentenced to 18 months in jail. A Crown spokesman has confirmed Hopley admitted in court that he attempted to take a 10-year-old boy from a home in Sparwood, although charges of unlawful confinement and attempted abduction were stayed.In the 1980s, Hopley was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to two years in federal prison.Hopley hasn't been charged in Kienan's disappearance. Two of his recent defence lawyers have declined comment.Shirley Bond, who is both the attorney general and solicitor general in B.C., wasn't available for an interview. In a written statement, Bond said she couldn't comment on an ongoing criminal case."I understand the RCMP is planning to review some of the questions at hand, such as the process around the issuing of the Amber Alert, which I fully support," said the statement."At this time, we need to take care not to say anything that might compromise the ongoing police investigation or any future prosecution."An RCMP spokesman did not return a request for comment Monday.Brad Bostock, executive director of Child Find Canada, said the criticism directed at the RCMP — for the Amber Alert and the circumstances surrounding Kienan's return — may be misplaced.Bostock noted there are specific criteria in place to determine when an Amber Alert should be issued.Police must believe a child has been abducted and is in danger, and they must have information such as a vehicle description or license plate number to distribute."People question the Amber Alert system because, in a lot of the situations, they don't have a full understanding of the criteria that needs to be met before it can be activated," said Bostock."I think what would end up happening is that if we relaxed the criteria and we saw a greater number of Amber Alerts put out into the general public, we would see them lose their importance. People would become desensitized."Bostock said he's never heard of another case in which an abductor returned a child home unnoticed, and there would have been little reason for police to be watching the family home."To have the child returned to the home at three o'clock in the morning, that's really unprecedented," said Bostock."A lot of people are being critical of law enforcement, but I don't think anybody realistically thought, 'He's probably going to bring the kid right back home and put him on the couch,' so we should have a law-enforcement officer sitting on that couch waiting.'"— By James Keller in Vancouver

OMG! Seriously??! People are questioning the Amber Alert because he was (eventually) returned unharmed?? So, these people would only have been happy with an Amber Alert if the boy had been sexually violated or murdered? They're more sick and twisted than the abductor!

the justice system didn't fail.it done what it is in position for. It kept a bunch of useless members in our society is very well payingjobs.You seldom hear of justice being done.The justice and correctional systems are money pits and all money put there is a complete waste. Look at the legal aid system.Making millionaires out of lawyers who know how to wheel and deal with no thought of the victims.

the whole system is a money scam for the goverment i have a friend that a psycologist and she flat out says you can "cure" Alcoholics Drug Attics most Mental DIsorders  but theres nothing you can do for a Sex Offender they will always do it again the only way to deal with people that touch kids is with a gun because they worse than Cock Roaches in my eyes. Sex Offenders are the exception they should make for serving people the death Sentence especially when its agaisnt Children that is so unforgivable. i hope this guy goes back to jail. they dont look upon sex offenders so lightly there.

The whole justice system of Canada needs to be replaced with harsher punishments and judges who will actuallly use them plus parole boards that actually look at the facts leading up to the arrests and not just feeling one is rehabilitated after some small time in jail. Some people never learn so the person's total record should also be made available to all parole boads and it must be mandatory that they actually read it. There are far too many crooks getting off and innocents left to suffer and actually made to feel they are the cause by the courts and not really regarded at all. They certainly do need to bring back the death penalty too for murder and especially one of a law enforcement officer or a child. To hell with what the United Nations or any other group thinks about that. This is Canada and we must start worrying about Canadians for a change  and not worrying what the rest of the world will say or do. Many States still have the death penalty yet the USA is  constantly talking about human rights but never seems to listen to their own claptrap.

Everything about this case is strange.  Mr. Hopley has been tried and convicted without even a trial or questioning.  How often do police announce the name and details of a suspect in this way?  They usually keep that kind of information to themselver.   How long was the little boy alone in his home after being returned before the police found him?  Curiouser and Curiouser!!!!!!!!  It just doesn't make sense.

WOW there is some seriously paranoid people on here. Anyone happen to stop for a moment and think maybe he never took the boy to molest him but for ransom.The last kid he tried to take he was going to ask for ransom for him. Perhaps the house was a place where to take the kid after the money was dropped. We can guess and make up things forever..how about some patience and stop playing CSI or super sleuth and accusing people and wait and see what really happened. You think the cops are going to tell us everything up front. won't come out till court. Some of you are just sick and mean...

The system in Canada protects the criminal and by sheer luck, the victim!  Most often, criminals and their names are not published so that, you may be sitting in a public bench and the next guy sitting beside you may be a rapist or a murderer and you have no idea at all!

balloon boy didn't actually have a suspect did they? the suspect most def has issues but also maybe struggles with them & realized what he was doing was wrong hence the return which really is all anyone should be concerned with, a little boy is back home with his family and not hurt or worse, deceased! To assume another "balloon boy" incident just shows the cynical nature of this world. Lets just be thankful another family is not mourning the loss of a child! 
My main issue now is with the Amber Alert in this case. Should have been country wide maybe even in the states considering the timeline & how far this suspect could have taken the child. If this was my children I would raise hell to have Amber Alert raised all over the country!! Amber Alert is to save our children, how can it save them if its not used to its fullest potential??? 
Just my opinon

Having seen the child on tv today, I believe that what shows as a birthmark above is a bruise because it didn't show today. So, the best picture of their child that they had was one with a black eye? Weird.

The justice system failed because it always fails and is set up to fail here in Canada...repeat offenders means repeat business for all those associated with the "justice" system!

When someone repeats and is let out on bail all they hear is CHA CHING!

A man in the U.S. who is a repeat DUI offender killed a woman and bail was set for $500,000...really? Why was bail even set for a repeat offender...CHA CHING!

You can't help sexual predators through therapy! You have to remove the chemical, gene or whatever else generates the impulse to prey on children...that goes for those who love child porn!! I guess that would fall under immoral though.

Let me ask you...what is more immoral? Having a family BEG for their child back or truly helping a sexual predator first time or repeat to finally become a civil member of society.

Oh, by the way...Paul Bernardo, although in solitary confinement has a television, possibly internet, 3 meals a day, clothing, doesn't have a mortgage to worry about, doesn't have a job or house to worry about losing, doesn't have to worry about increasing grocery, hydro or gas costs or any other cost of LIVING...no all he had to do was RAPE AND MURDER innocent teenage girls and we're all picking up the tab...CHA CHING!

Ohhhh Canada :-(

If I knew that a mentally unstable person had my kid, I might leave the door unlocked too thinking that the criminal might just return my kid. Maybe a psychiatrist or psychologist told them to do that. Look at a pic of Hopley. He is not all there. Maybe the door was left unlocked on purpose to give Hopley a way to return the boy without feeling scared. And guess what? In small towns, doors are left unlocked lots of times... they were when I was a kid and some small towns still have that old fashioned mentality.

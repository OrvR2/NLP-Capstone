IOWA: THE HEARTLAND
Where you can skinny sip with assorted melons:

Visit an old fashioned pizza parlor:
Blast from the past!
See a lot of windmills:

View adorable photos from years past:
Christian, around age 2, with his mom
Get dwarfed by some really big structures:


And really big machinery:





Cram 8 people AND THEIR LUGGAGE into a 7 person SUV:


Doesn't my SIL look thrilled?
And this:
Whaaaaa???

						The Diner is Closed. Again.

									It’s official. I weaned Zoe. For months I’ve wondered when this day would come, but I wasn’t in any hurry. We’ve talked about it for months, and it was my recent 5 day trip to Iowa that sealed the deal. I don’t have anything profound to say about it, and I know that those who haven’t or haven’t been able to nurse their babies may not understand how much I’ll miss that special time with her, how much I loved when she fell asleep on my lap. Rachel and Claire pretty much weaned themselves at a little over a year old. Here’s a little piece I wrote for them back in April 2009. The diner is closed.  Well, it actually closed a few weeks ago.  We did it very gradually, with our favorite customers slowly decreasing the amount of time spent in the diner.  Then they started coming fewer times...

						How to help Texas fire victims

									I’m forgoing my usual Attitude of Gratitude post this weekend for something very important. Because I’m grateful that I still have a home, that I live in an area unaffected by the horrendous fires that have displaced so many in my beloved town and surrounding areas. Wildfires have burned in Leander, Cedar Park, Steiner Ranch, and most notably Bastrop County, where the out of control fires have consumed over 34,000 acres and destroyed over 1300 homes (nbcdfw.com). As of today, September 9, 2011, the fire remains only 30% contained. Communities have been evacuated. Families have lost everything. People are in need. How can I help? Fox 7 Food Drive — Now through Sept 25, bring any nonperishable food items, diapers, and formula to any Sonic location. Red Cross of Central Texas — Visit their website, or call 512-929-1250 or 512-928-4271. You can also text REDCROSS to 90999 to make a... Continue Reading

									Can anyone tell me if my house is still standing? Or have the children gone all Lord of the Flies on my husband? Yes, I’m still gone! I’m having a great time! I may never come back! Wait, it gets wicked cold up here in Iowa in the winters. I’m not made for that. Ok, I’ll come back soon. But while I’m still gone and having a blast with all these amazing women up here, I have another amazing women RIGHT HERE on this blog to keep you company. She’s my bloggy BFF and Canadian sister wife. And like any good sister wife, she’s down here helping Christian with the kids and babysitting my blog while I’m gone. Ok, maybe just the blog stuff. Please give a warm welcome to the incredible Leighann of Multitasking Mumma! She’s getting married next year and is knee deep in wedding fantasies, plans, and... Continue Reading

									Happy Labor Day weekend everyone! This is a monumental weekend. Big things are happening. First of all, today I’m hanging out at This Blogger Makes Fun of Stuff, talking about my very favorite hotel — the only one at which we can enjoyably stay with our three younguns. Go check it out and find out where you need to be staying!   I also put a post up at BizChickBlogs this month about why we often have a hard time saying “no.” Take a gander and see if you can relate. In other big news, I’m leaving. On a jet plane. I DO, however, know when I’ll be back again. But the best part is that I’m going to be on that plane BY MYSELF, as in no kids {at least none that belong to me} and no husband {I’ll miss you honey!}. I’m headed up to the great rural...

						iPhone Photo Phun – End of Hell, I mean summer

									Welcome to iPhone Photo Phun, brought to you by the amazing Liz and KLZ! These ladies started this weekly meme to give us a place to share those fun photos that we take at the spur of the moment with our phones. I’m sorry to say that I probably take more photos with my phone than I do my DSLR. Oh, and my version is actually NiPPP — “Not an iPhone Photo Phun.” But they’re still letting me join in. Yay for acceptance! School is already in session, and we’re about to start Mother’s Day Out with our backpacks, lunch bags, our fears, and our predictions. Unfortunately the “end of summer” doesn’t really mean much. It’s not going to cool off for good around here until well into October. I mean, it’s seriously hot this year. Ridiculously hot, with triple digit temps for over 70 days straight now. To celebrate... Continue Reading

						Pee in your pants, but please eat your carrots.

									This Thursday, 9/1 is the day — the day when I ship my girls off to Mother’s Day Out for the first time ever. They’re so excited! I’m SO EXCITED! We talk about going to school every single day. I know they’ll do great, and it’ll be good for all of us. I even kinda know what to expect, to a degree. But I still have some fears. Rachel will pee her pants. This is less of a fear than it is a fact. I know. Once kids are potty trained accidents are inevitable for months to come, if not years. But this girl is really giving me a run for my money when it comes to using the actual toilet, and they only have normal sized ones to use there. I relented to bribing them with an M&M, which worked swimmingly on Claire, but Rachel’s not convinced that the... Continue Reading

						An Attitude of Gratitude #16

									Welcome to Attitude of Gratitude! If you’re not familiar with my weekly post, find out why I started it! This week definitely had it’s ups and downs. Monday I opened up my email to see that my Paypal account had been hacked and some jerk named Dimitri had set up an automatic payment from me to him. Props on the hacking, but that’s not nice! Plus, I don’t keep any money in that account anyway, so joke’s on you, fool! And then the day ended with a call to Poison Control when I realized that instead of her antibiotics for her ear infection, C had given Rachel a dose of some random goo from way back in April. {This is why it’s good to clean out the ENTIRE fridge, not just the main shelves.} No biggie, she’s fine. But we definitely had some wins this week, and I’ve found myself... Continue Reading

									This is part of an ongoing series chronicling my attempts to regain a bit of my sense of self, and my sanity, by implementing Elizabeth Lyons’ 32 Rules that Sustain a (Mostly) Balanced Mom. Subscribe to my RSS feed to follow my experiment, and check out the rest of the posts in the series! —————- While out shopping one day, I passed by a mom pushing a double stroller, two car seats snapped into the frame.   This always grabs my attention. Twin moms almost always accost other twin moms. We know how irritating it is to get stopped by just about every person who sees that you have more than one infant, but once we let on that we’re twin moms too, it’s like meeting an old family member –someone who knows your trials, triumphs, and debilitating sleep deprivation. I smiled and asked her how old they were, and gestured over to... Continue Reading

						Ear Candy

									When I was a young lass at the tender age of 15, I lived and breathed music. I would scour the pages of the entertainment that came in the Sunday edition of the Dallas morning news, clipping out any articles or photos of my favorite bands. My friends and I annually attended concerts like Edgefest and Steve Miller, with other fun ones in between. My taste in music has evolved quite a bit over the years, but I’ve always been an alternative girl, moving onto more indie and singer/songwriter stuff as of late. And I love to enlighten people on my awesome music choices. So I decided that you need some enlightening. Check out some ear candy that I can’t get enough of these days.Keep in mind that I don’t listen to a lot of commercial radio, and I knew more about Lady Gaga from Glee than I do from...

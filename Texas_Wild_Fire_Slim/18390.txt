Captcha Test

CAPTCHA Test

  This test will check the function of the CAPTCHA outside of the WordPress environment.
  If you are having a problem with the CAPTCHA, this test can help rule out or
  confirm a possible conflict with another plugin.
  To begin the test, type the phrase in the CAPTCHA field and click "submit", then see if the test passes.


Note: If you see any errors or warnings at the top of the page
Click for Help!


If you see an error "Warning: session_start..."
There is a problem with
your PHP server that will prevent the CAPTCHA from working with PHP sessions.
Sometimes PHP session do not work because of a file permissions problem.
The solution is to make a trouble ticket with your web host,
send them a URL link to this page so they can see the error and fix it.
Alternatively, you can enable the setting "Use CAPTCHA without PHP Session",
then temporary files will be used for storing the CAPTCHA phrase.
This allows the CAPTCHA to function without using PHP Sessions.
You can find this setting on the contact form admin settings page.



Note: If the CAPTCHA image is missing text or does not show at all.

Click for Help!


If the image is missing the text:
Go to the plugin settings and check the setting "Disable CAPTCHA transparent text".
It will not fix it on the test page, but it might fix it on the WordPress forms.


If the image is missing completely:
There is a problem with your PHP server that will prevent the CAPTCHA from working,
check the PHP error log for clues.

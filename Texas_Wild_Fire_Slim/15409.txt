Radios a lifeline for firefighters
Posted on 08 September 2011 by Martha DeGrasse. Tags: Austin, Bastrop, Motorola, public safety, radios, wildfires

 Comment  Tweet  Share  Share  DiggCourtesy Mike Stone/Reuters
Central Texas firefighters are battling the worst wildfire in the state’s history, and they’re relying on their portable radios to help them do their jobs and stay alive. The Motorola Solutions radios not only enable firefighters to communicate with one another, they also allow them to maintain contact with a location commander who can use a portable computer to manage the operation. Â The radios can transmit the firefighter’sÂ position in the squad, radio battery life, Mayday emergency alerts, evacuation alerts, voice responses and automatic resource reporting. These “automatic accountability” reports from the radios transmit on the same network as the firefighters’ voice communications.
Bastrop firefighters upgraded to an 800 MHz digital radio system after the Wilderness Ridge Wildfire in 2009. Although no lives were lost in that fire, the men and women fighting the fire were hampered by their inability to communicate with other fire departments who came to help, and with local police and EMS workers. The new Motorola system allows them to talk to other departments, and to create “talk groups” for converstations that only need to be heard by a certain group. The radio system was paid for by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Live audio feeds from the Bastrop County Public Safety Department are available at Radio Reference.
In the event that public safety communications are compromised or overwhelmed, Bastrop Country will rely on two backup communications Sites on Wheels (SOWs). Motorola Solutions supplied these early in the week, along with 100 VHF rental radios and batteries for use by the outside agencies that have come in to assist with the fire.

Whitepaper: Measuring LTE Modulation Quality

This application note presents a simpler and faster method of measuring modulation qualityâmaking the measurement over-the-air with a handheld instrument. This method is based on the fact that control channels do not use spatial multiplexing or beamforming because they have to operate over the entire cell, including at the cell edges.

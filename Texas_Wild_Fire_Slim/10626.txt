The Texas Forest Service completed a study that analyzed the forest sector’s direct and total impacts in 1999 to the overall Texas economy. Total industry output, value-added, employment, and labor income were compared in six sub-industries within the forest sector for both Texas and East Texas. The sub-industries included forestry, logging, primary solid wood products, secondary solid wood products, primary paper and paperboard products, and secondary paper and paperboard products.
In 1999, the Texas forest sector directly impacted the economy by producing $12.9 billion of industry outputs, $4.6 billion of which were value-added. It employed 79,500 workers and paid $2.9 billion wages, salaries and benefits in the same year. In East Texas, the forest sector produced $6.1 billion of goods and services. It generated $2.2 billion in value-added, 32,600 jobs and $1.2 billion in labor income.
Statewide, the secondary solid wood products industry produced the largest value-added, employed the most labor force, and generated the highest labor income in the forest sector. The largest industry output came from the secondary paper andpaperboard products industry. Whereas in East Texas, the primary paper and paperboard products industry was the number one producer with the largest output, value-added and labor income. The secondary solid wood products industry was the largest employer.
The study reinforces the importance of the forest sector to the Texas economy, especially in East Texas where most of the state’s commercial forests are located. For future research, the multipliers published in this study can be used for assessing the economic impact of individual projects in the Texas forest sector.

Remember that American Apparel's plus-size model contest, the one that called on self-respecting women with "full-sized fannies" to submit their model shots to be voted on with a scale of "Not quite" to "XLent"?
Well, one plus-size woman named Nancy Upton was just as displeased we were. Except she entered the contest and made a Tumblr about it.
Upton went online and submitted herself to American Apparel's contest, writing in her entry, "I'm a size 12. I just can't stop eating."
The accompanying photos, instead of the typical glamour shots submitted by most contestants, depict Nancy in stages of undress covered with and/or eating a variety of food: chicken, ranch dressing, chocolate syrup, pie. 
Alarmingly in-your-face, the pics show Nancy unapologetically flaunting her curves while luxuriating in calories. 
While a few of the images are on American Apparel's website, most live on her brand-new Tumblr, ExtraWiggleRoom. Nancy tweeted on Monday, "I started a tumblr about how offensive this American Apparel contest is/as an excuse to cover myself in dressing. http://extrawiggleroom.tumblr.com/."
Since then her photos have received over a thousand comments. Some of the negative reactions have compelled Upton to clarify her mission. "It's a dig on American Apparel's current tone and past policy," Upton told us, and certainly "not meant to be offensive towards plus-size women."
But she stands by her clever critique of the retailer and its meat market approach to finding XL models. 
Check out a few of Upton's photos below and go to her Tumblr, ExtraWiggleRoom, to see more.

				"I was going to be nice but.....Yo­­u are a self loathing fatty making excuses for your failures and taking it out on the world. Deal with yourself instead of blaming others"

actually I'm pretty self-accep­ting: I love my fat, healthy, beautiful body, though we all have our bad days.  the only people worth negative scrutiny are those who seek to shame others because of who or what they are.  I'm fat, I'm healthy, and I love wearing pretty clothes.  Get over it.

				Except I'm not ashamed of myself, and I can definitely blame puberty - I swear, it was like I grew 38DDD breasts and big hips and thighs overnight!  Nobody was more surprised than me, and it upset me all through my teens, but I love my voluptuous look now.

Anyway, calling you out on your internalis­ed misogyny, size-shami­ng, etc, isn't exactly the definition of an insult.

				"not all obesity is morbid"

As I said before, other than smoking, there is no greater preventabl­e risk to your health than being overweight­.  

"also I heard living is a hazard to one's health! the more you know, right?"

So because we're all going to die, it's best to just smoke and eat bacon donuts all day?  Not really a valid argument.

I'm pretty sure I can comment on whatever I want.

				Good for her...love the way she's satirizing that ridiculous American Apparel contest. She's funny and obviously having fun with her shenanigan­s. Look, I'm a size 8...I have problems finding clothing because they may have 2 size 8's on the rack..if I'm lucky. I live in LA where practicall­y every woman is either on a diet, going on a diet or obsessing about eating 1 chip and 1 M & M. Then exercising themselves into a coma, only to wake up,  look in the mirror and not see ribs, protruding collar bones as well as legs small enough to thread through a needle, but someone who needs to lose 10 more pounds. This is the eating disorder capital of the US. So when I see someone who is obviously tall  however, slightly overweight like Nancy Upton accepting her body and all of it's glory and flaws...ye­s I applaud her. Obesity is a problem, but this woman is not obese. She enjoys her life and doesn't take body image too seriously and as long as she's healthy...­have fun! What I can't stand is someone making nasty comments about another person just because they don't fit some idiotic societal norm.

				of course lane bryant isn't enough.  I go to them for their lingerie and lingerie only.  most of their clothes aren't cute, especially for those of us in our twenties who are quite fashion forward.  I might be thirty pounds overweight but that doesn't mean I'm going to go around wearing frumpy mumu shirts and capris just because society says they'll "flatter" me, when all they really want me to do is hide my stomach, arms, and thighs because I'm not not what is considered an "acceptabl­e" body shape/weig­ht.

				All that your comment reveals is that you appear to have off-the-ch­art levels of anxiety around body image, weight gain and food intake.

And as for shame, that's not likely been an emotion that's helped you out much in your life has it? And does hoping that others experience the same levels of self-loath­ing as you make you feel any better? -- of course not.

Still, if moral fortitude is defined by an ability to wear Chanel then I think I'll hang out with the corrupt pie-eating Nancy Upton. And that's saying nothing of my extreme disgust for fur farms used by Chanel: http://fea­tures.peta­.org/Chine­seFurFarms­/ftf.asp

I'm a size 4 and I don't wear Chanel.

				Dear Nancy,

I'm speechless and utterly disgusted with your attempt at making a point. Which by the way, I still don't get what exactly it was you were trying to prove? 

American Apparel didn't used to carry XL. Now they do. So what. 

Your little, thoughtles­s, attempt-at­-feminism display is literally steering us curvy women in the wrong direction.

It is obvious that you have a lot of free time on your hands. Maybe you could use some of that time and energy into something a little more meaningful­, instead of channeling all that built-up hate into embarrassi­ng not only yourself, but plus size women all over the world.

Regards, 
Erin

				Good for her; she's giving a big ol' middle finger to American Apparel.  

American Apparel deserves the big ol' middle finger... and then to be ignored until they curl up and slink away.

				this honestly isn't about catering to plus-sized women.  this is about how American Apparel talks about and showcases plus-sized women, i.e. in a disrespect­ful, size-shami­ng way.

				I don't dislike American Apparel because they don't cater to large women.  For me, that's not an issue because I am a petite.

I dislike American Apparel because I hate their smarmy advertisem­ents.

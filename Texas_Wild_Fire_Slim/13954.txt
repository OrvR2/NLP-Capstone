Houston Chronicle Celebrates Girl Scout Adult Volunteers



The Houston Chronicle, TX, has an article about the Girl Scouts' White Oak Service Unit. The volunteer unit comprises six women dedicated to providing the Girl Scout troops it serves with information, resources and support."What I've gotten out of it is friendship," said Debra Lewis of the service unit, in which she has been serving for two years. "I love the relationships I've formed with these leaders. You're sharing your talents." White Oak Service Unit serves 44 Girl Scout troops in the areas served by Jersey Village High School, Cook Middle School and Post, Gleason and Bang elementary schools. As of last May, the unit's troops had 471 girls and 180 volunteers.These days, the Girl Scout experience is not limited to participating in a troop.Girls can do that, but they also have the option of choosing other Girl Scout Pathways, according to Mariana Almanza, a membership manager with the Girl Scouts of San Jacinto Council. "The Girl Scouts really want to engage girls of all ages, kindergarten through 12th grade, and of all backgrounds; so we're offering a more flexible experience."A Girl Scout can try one or more of any of the organization's Pathways: camp, troop, event, travel program, series - which could include a class or multiday workshop - and online. Girls also can choose the Pathways' program opportunities, including horseback riding, sailing, drill team, archery, backpacking, rifling and health and safety."If they want to be in Scouts, girls and volunteers can do it for a weekend, or for a lifetime," Almanza said. "I like that it is girl-focused," she said. "For me, that really was the selling point. The whole point of the program is to guide girls."Girl Scouting could not exist without adult volunteers. Do you have an adult volunteer you would like to give a shout out to?

Horse Camp in California Inspires Generations of Girl Scouts



The Girl Scouts of San Gorgonio Council Blog reports that since its inception in 1940, several generations of Girl Scouts have grown up with horse camp at Camp Azalea Trails.Most of the girls who attend the camp don't have any other access to horses. Twenty percent of them are foster children for whom the horses are an invaluable form of therapy. The relationships they build with these beautiful creatures helps them to overcome their shyness and uncertainty and mature into confident, responsible young women.Unlike private luxury camps, where it's just about putting on a saddle and going for a ride, the girls at Camp Azalea Trails must care for each horse's needs, from feeding and grooming to mucking and raking. They learn what it is like to be completely responsible for the well-being of these animals on a much deeper level. It's a unique experience they carry with them for the rest of their lives.Thirty-four-year-old Meridith Rhea attended her first horse camp at Azalea Trails when she was in 5th grade. Today Meridith is a professional in the field of necropsy and works closely with the California racing board. She diagnoses illnesses and injuries suffered by racehorses and works to prevent them from spreading to others. How have your earliest Girl Scouting experiences shaped the person you are today?

The Resilience Factor: A Key to Leadership in African American and Hispanic Girls



Today, Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Designate, Anna Maria Chavez, addressed the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute and released key findings about Hispanic girls by the Girl Scout Research Institute (GSRI).  In “The Resilience Factor: A Key to Leadership in African American and Hispanic Girls,” Girl Scouts found that African American and Hispanic girls aspired to leadership more than Caucasian girls and had more frequent and more positive leadership experiences.“For 100 years, Girl Scouting has built girls of courage, confidence, and character who make the world a better place,” said Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Designate Anna Maria Chavez.  “With five million Latinas age 5 to 17 in the US, Latinas are the fastest-growing demographic group.  This research will help Girl Scout indentify the best way to serve all girls in the Latina community. ”According to GSRI, African American and Hispanic girls not only aspire to leadership more than Caucasian girls and have more frequent and more positive leadership experiences, but also rate themselves higher than Caucasian girls on key leadership indicators such as overall self-confidence.  They also appreciated qualities such as creativity, caring, and problem solving.Interestingly, many of the social and cultural challenges facing African American and Hispanic girls – racism, inequity, and injustice – are the very factors that increase their resilience and capacity for leadership.  Many Hispanic and African American girls overcome difficulties and excel.  Girl Scouts’ research identified three main factors that affect Latina girls’ resilience - the girl herself, her family, and the community that provides her support.Understanding that not all African American and Hispanic girls are resilient, the GSRI research further explores the family, school, community, and cultural protective factors that help develop girls who are considered resilient in the face of stressors, assisting youth-serving organizations in engaging African American and Hispanic girls and young women in leadership development.

Japan Marks 6 Months Since Earthquake, Tsunami



Up and down Japan's devastated northeast coast, survivors prayed and communities came together Sunday to mark six months since the massive earthquake and tsunami struck on March 11, a date that changed everything for them and their country.New York's Times Union reports that as the world commemorated the 10th anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks, Japanese parents hung colorful paper cranes for their lost children and monks chanted in front of smashed buildings. Thousands also marched in the streets to demand that the country abandon nuclear power because of damage to the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant.The magnitude-9.0 earthquake produced the sort of devastation Japan hadn't seen since World War II. The tsunami that followed engulfed the northeast and wiped out entire towns. The waves inundated the Fukushima plant, triggering the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. Some 20,000 people are dead or missing. More than 800,000 homes were completely or partially destroyed. The disaster crippled businesses, roads and infrastructure. The Japanese Red Cross Society estimates that 400,000 people were displaced.In March, Girl Scouts of the USA encouraged girls to make origami cranes (Sadako) to send to their sister Girl Scouts in Japan as expressions of friendship after the devastating earthquake and tsunami. In Florida, Girl Scout Senior Troop 457 took the call to heart, and made 1,000 cranes to send to Girl Scouts in Japan. They started making the cranes in June and continued during each meeting over the summer. Do you have any examples of Girl Scouts reaching out to those whose lives have been disrupted by disasters.

A Message on Behalf of Kathy Cloninger - Remembering 9/11



Today marks the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Ten years is a long time in the Girl Scout Movement; many of our current members had not been born when 9/11 happened, and many others were too young to have retained any solid memory of the event.  It seems appropriate, on this anniversary, to take a moment to consider these millions of girls and ask ourselves what is important for them to know about this event they cannot remember.We teach our girls that they matter, that each of them has a place in the world that is hers alone. Through Girl Scouting, they learn what it means to make the world a better place through their actions. It would be good for girls to know about the sheer goodness and bravery this horrific event brought out in everyday people.  Within minutes of the fall of the World Trade Center, for example, a swarm of tugboats and ferries and pleasure craft converged on the tip of Manhattan Island to rescue people from the site and carry them to safety. It was the largest peacetime waterborne evacuation in American history.No one told the masters of those boats to do that. No one told passersby on the street to drop what they were doing and rush to try to help, and no one had to tell the police and the fire fighters on the scene to do their duty. They did it, all of them, because they saw what needed to be done and took action.Our thoughts today are with all of you, with our nation, and in reverence for those who passed away as a result of 9/11.  Our thoughts, as well, are with those continuing to support those affected by 9/11, those defending our democracy, those who keep the light and the memory of the fallen alive—and those everyday people who opened their homes and their hearts and risked life and limb, whose names we may never know.This is courage, confidence, and character.  May we and our girls remember that even at the worst of times, it is possible—and very important—to make the world a better place.Kathy Cloninger, National CEO, Girl Scouts of the USA

Girl Scouts Offer Aid to Central Texas Wildfire Victims



Girl Scouts of Central Texas reports that Girl Scouts, volunteers and staff are responding to the massive wildfires that ravaged through Central Texas this past weekend. Donations are currently being accepted at the Kodosky Program Center in Austin and Camp Texlake is open to evacuees who may need shelter. Starting next week, Oak Hill Service Unit will show thanks to more than 100 firefighters by providing dinners to their local firehouses. Established in 2002, the initiative - known as the Firehouse Challenge - sets to feed every firefighter in the Austin, Round Rock and Georgetown area. The challenge will honor the memory and service of the 9/11 first responders and recognize the work of the Central Texas wildfire firefighters.The 2011 Texas wildfires are an ongoing series of wildfires that have burned over 3,582,000 acres across Texas. The fires have been particularly severe due to the ongoing 2011 Southern US drought covering the state. Exacerbating the problem is a unusual convergence of strong winds, unseasonably warm temperatures and low humidity. On Labor Day, 500 homes were destroyed in and around Bastrop, TX, by a particularly lethal wildfire. Firefighters from more than forty-three states have been involved in the operation to combat the fires.Our thoughts go out to anyone impacted by the Texas Wildfires.

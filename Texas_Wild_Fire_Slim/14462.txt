No ordinary Game Day




  
Just about anyone who was old enough to remember has a story to tell about where they were and what they were doing when they found out about the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Televisions were switched on in classrooms across the country, co-workers gathered in front of break room screens to watch in silence and others were at home viewing the horrific images alone or while on the phone with loved ones. 
This week, many local residents took time to share their own Sept. 11 stories. Most said that initially they had a hard time believing what they were seeing, that it didn't seem fathomable. 
***
About half an hour after the second tower was hit and a few minutes before Flight 77 flew into the Pentagon, Caldwell resident Viola Gutierrez gave birth to a baby boy at St. Joseph Regional Health Center. 
"When the second plane hit, my husband was telling me what was happening and I said, 'Don't tell me right now, I'm in too much pain,'" she said. 
Gutierrez said the labor ward was short on doctors as hers was home with a sick child, and the uncertainty of what was going on elsewhere in the nation had a lot of the medical staff distracted. 
"I was in sharp pains having the baby and they were telling me not to push because there weren't any doctors there yet," she said. "When I had him, he couldn't breathe for 30 seconds and a special nurse had to come in."
It wasn't until the following day that Gutierrez said she truly began to realize what had happened. 
"It was a sad day for a lot of people, so we were so happy that our son is fine," she said.
***
Two days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Chandler Russell, who was 7 at the time, was interviewed by The Eagle.
The reporter wrote that Russell had repeatedly asked his parents, "Who are the terrorists? Did the people in the plane die?" 
Ten years later, the Bryan High School senior said he remembers watching everything that was happening, but was "ignorant as to what was really going on." 
"I was in my second grade class at Sam Houston Elementary and our teacher goes, 'There's been a tragedy in New York City,'" Chandler said. "She turned on the TV and she started to cry." 
Chandler said he was staring at images of smoke coming out of the buildings when he witnessed the first tower fall, and shortly afterward the second collapse.
"We really didn't talk about it, we just kind of had the TV running on silent," he said. "At first we thought it was an accident, then my parents told me that they were terrorists." 
***
Jacque Newberry, 32, was a senior at Texas A&M when the towers were hit. She now works as a first-grade teacher at Neal Elementary School.
"I was in my apartment off campus and I didn't even have a TV, didn't have a cellphone," she said. 
Newberry had happened to call her mentor to discuss school matters that morning, but he told her to turn on her television. 
"I was like, I can't -- I don't have  a TV," she said. "All he told me was, 'There's something going on -- you need to get to a television." 
Newberry said she rushed to the bus stop and rode to the MSC on campus, where she joined many other Aggies already watching the events unfold on live TV. 
 "We spent the whole day there trying to figure out what was going on and what was happening,"  she said. "I remember watching the coverage and thinking it was fake."
***
For College Station police officer Rhonda Seaton, the attacks served as a reminder about what's really important. 
"I was having an issue with a clothing store that is headquartered in NYC and that morning I had been put on hold during a telephone call. I waited and waited and nobody ever came back to the phone. I finally got irritated and hung up the phone," she said. 
"I walked into the other room where they had a television on. The first tower was on fire. I knew then why I had been put on hold and forgotten. At that point I was the least of their worries. I felt bad because I had been irritated over something that was so minor compared to what they were going through."
***
Virginia Redwine was a sophomore at A&M Consolidated High School when Bonfire fell and said it deeply affected her. So when planes flew into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon, Redwine said she and many of her friends felt like the world was coming to an end. 
She hadn't heard what had happened until she walked into her senior anatomy class that morning and found her teacher and classmates were watching the news.
"I just remember the initial shock, it was a very weird, a very different experience," she said. "It changed everything as far as becoming an adult." 
***
Standing in the break room at the Bryan Municipal Court waiting to take the stand in a traffic ticket case, Bryan police officer Jon Agnew received a text from his wife saying a plane had hit the World Trade Center.
"She said, 'Just turn on the news,'" he recalled. 
But he was unable to find a TV and stayed on the phone with his wife as the second plane hit. 
"I didn't know what was going on until that second plane hit, then I realized, 'This is bull,'" he said. 
Having to testify was a challenge knowing what was going on elsewhere, he said. 
"I found what I was doing to be insignificant at the time," he said. "I was able to focus on it, but I had a sense of uncomfortableness. It was all we discussed the rest of the day." 
***
Jim Bruffet was welcoming visitors at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum on Saturday where a special Sept. 11 memorial exhibit had been set up when he sat down to recall where he was that morning. 
"My wife and I were having breakfast, watching TV and I remember Bryant Gumbel was one of the announcers. The first picture we saw was of the first tower with smoke coming out of it.
"While we were talking about it, the second plane came on screen and drove directly into the second tower. You wondered if it was actually real -- there are people who say we never landed on the moon. But then reality set in. It was hard to understand how any person or persons would have that much hatred." 
Bruffet was 6 when Pearl Harbor was attacked, and remembers finding out about the Kennedy assassination while on his way to work in the car. Another day he'll never forget was when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded while he was at work. 
***
Rudder High School chemistry teacher Samantha Ott was in volleyball practice when the towers were hit, so she had no idea what was going on when she walked into her second period class and found her fellow seventh-graders in tears. 
Her teacher explained what had happened and turned on the television, giving Ott a better sense of what had transpired.
She remembers knowing things were serious when some of the kids in her school began worrying about their relatives who worked in or near the towers. 
Ott said there was a feeling of confusion and chaos throughout the day, but at the same time the mood was calm and somber. 
"A lot of parents pulled their kids out on that day," she said. "I had a friend whose parents went out and bought a lot of canned food goods."
***
Nikki Wicketts, who's now 22 and finishing her fifth year in A&M's accounting program, was living and going to school on the Randall Air Force Base in San Antonio on Sept. 11. 
She was required to remain her in seventh-grade theater class -- one of the few classrooms with a TV -- throughout the day while the rest of the base was put on lockdown. 
All day, military personnel searched cars and buildings for any potential threats. Officials closed three of the four entrances to the base and immediately began requiring stricter forms of identification.
"It was just kind of a surreal day," she said. "Everything changed and was more strict after that." 
***
Bryan resident Connie Alberson, 58, and her sister were visiting with their father on his front porch in North Bryan on Saturday afternoon when they expressed, like many have, that it doesn't feel like 10 years have passed since the attacks.
"[My sister] called and told me what happened and I started to listen to it on the radio,"  she said. "I didn't get to a TV until I was off work, and to really see everything in detail was totally different." 
 Alberson said that she was in so much shock and awe of what was happening, that even if she had seen the videos live it probably still wouldn't have seemed real at first. 
"We were all in disbelief," she said. "That's not what we expected that day when we left home."

BASTROP, Texas (AP) — Texas Gov. Rick Perry unexpectedly canceled plans to visit areas hit by a massive Central Texas wildfire.
A  Perry spokeswoman said the governor's scheduled visit on Saturday of  damaged areas in Bastrop County near Austin as well as his participation  in a news conference with local and state officials did not take place  because of "logistical issues" with Perry arriving in Bastrop on time.
Perry's office on Friday had announced the governor would visit the area.
Perry  spokeswoman Allison Castle said the governor was in Austin and was  keeping in regular contact with officials on the wildfire.
Castle  did not say when Perry would return to Bastrop. Perry visited the area  earlier this week after he cut short a presidential campaign trip to  deal with the crisis.

Mr. Perry has spent more time out of the State than in it. Prior to running for president he only worked a total of 8 hours per week. He does not care about Texas or its people.

I think the last election was rigged.  How else did this man get back in office?  He couldn't care less about the people of Tx.  If he gets in office as President, it's because Big Business rigged the election, just like Bush's run in 2000.  The majority of the people didn't want Bush, and we got him anyway.  It'll be the same with Perry.

I find it ironic that he pressed Kay Bailey Hutchison about her not giving up her Senate seat to campaign for governor, but it's ok for his presidential campaigning to interfere with his governing duties....hmmmm. Can't you just see it now... President Rick Perry was in the Washington D.C. area, but not close enough to the White House to be there in time to meet with foreign dignitaries to discuss the US role in safety around the globe. When asked about his absence, the humidity was just too much for his hair and he can't look bad in front of world leaders. His staff will keep him advised of how the meeting went......

30 miles from Austin but he couldn't arrive in Bastrop "on time."

I'd bet if there was a hefty campaign check waiting for him in Bastrop he would have been there early . . . .

Well,the weather is clear.  Don't know why he couldn't attend. So, do you really want this man as our president?  I would think not.  He does not care anything about the people of Texas.

I wonder if he didn't go cause it may be bad for his campaign - Perry and wildfires don't go well together.

Maybe he is ashamed he prayed for rain and got fire.

I'm guessing this is a calculated risk - the negative press of not attending is better than the negative press of getting raked over the coals (literally) by the firefighters whose budgets were slashed by up to 75% in the last legislative session. Even the most seasoned politician would have a hard time showing up at a fire to tell the firefighters that their work is so important, so valued, and so critical to saving lives and property...but not important enough to be worth tapping the rainy day fund (if there was a more ironic term for those funds, I'll be surprised) to keep the fire departments staffed, supplied, and prepared. Awkward...

Remember, unless you are a millionaire supporting the Republican Party, the middle class is not of great importance to Mister Perry.

the time has come that Bozo Perry step aside and let someone else take over as Gov.   He doesn't and has not had Texas' best interest at heart for some time.  he has shown his "true Colors" by his actions where all of the wild fires are concerned.  Adios jerk!

Where are all the perry buttkissers talking about how he cares so much about texans that he's willing to leave the campaign trail to make sure we're ok? Hello idiots??? Are you out there or are you hiding in shame at being such ignorant fools?

Perry seemed to make it to the GOP debates just fine.  Actions speak louder than words...and his priorities are now clear.

I get the feeling WFAA will bump this story off the front page in very short order. No doubt it will be gone before midnight even though it's only been up for less than 2 hours. Hmmmm, I wonder why....??

Austin is only miles from Bastrop. The conceited idiot decided not to go because he doesn't care.

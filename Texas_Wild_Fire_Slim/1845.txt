Turkey vs. Israel: An irreparable rift?The Week – 21 hrs ago





After the United Nations deems Israel's Gaza blockade legal, a diplomatic feud breaks out over Turkey's demand for an apologyTense relations between Turkey and Israel snapped this week, after a United Nations report essentially exonerated Israel for last year's deadly assault on a Turkish vessel. The ship, Mavi Marmara, was trying to break Israel's naval blockade of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip when an Israeli raid killed eight Turkish citizens. After the U.N. released its report, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government had no reason to apologize. Turkey then expelled Israel's ambassador and suspended trade, and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that Turkish naval vessels would increase patrols in the eastern Mediterranean. Is there any way to keep the dispute from spiraling out of control? The rift will last as long as Erdogan is in charge:  The Turkish prime minister is threatening to escalate the conflict by visiting the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, says Jennifer Rubin in The Washington Post. That would make Israel furious, and bolster the Islamist Hamas while weakening the more moderate Palestinian Authority. As long as Erdogan's "in charge, a return to the good old days is highly unlikely.""Turkey and Israel: Can they repair the relationship?" An apology from Israel would fix everything:  The solution is simple, says Roger Cohen at The New York Times. While the U.N.'s report did say that Israel's naval blockade of Gaza is "a legitimate security measure" given Hamas' habit of firing rockets into Israel, it also called Israel's raid on the aid flotilla — which was 72 miles offshore — an excessive response. While the U.N. still essentially cleared Israel of wrongdoing, it still urged Netanyahu and Co. to express regret and pay compensation. "Israel, increasingly isolated, should do just that.""Israel isolates itself" This rift hurts Turkey, too:  The news that Erdogan is considering a trip to Gaza "raises the possibility of a sharp escalation in Turkey’s dispute with Israel," says Gideon Rachman at Britain's Financial Times. Already, Erdogan's "energetic championing of the Palestinian cause" has "profoundly changed" Turkey's reputation in Washington, D.C. Erdogan "presumably feels he can afford to stick it to the Israelis and their friends in Congress" to curry favor "on the Arab Street." But that isn't exactly a "brilliant move."

It is funny how Turkey wants an apology for an incident it was responsible for.  This ship came from Turkey and was intending to cause a confrontation with Israel.  How would Turkey like it if Israel took the side with the Kurds and gave them assistance? Also, look at how Turkey treated Greece with Cyprus.  These muslims are on the war path.  It is called jihad!

It is time for Turkey to apologize for the Armenian genocide during WW I.

It is time for the US to drop Turkey as a NATO member.  As Turkey becomes more islamic, it can not be trusted.  Its behavior with Israel prooves this.

If Israel decided to apologize to Turkey (but should they?!) for the death of only 8 Turkish people, they can do it, BUT NOT before Turkey will acknowledge the genocide of about 1 million Armenians and apologize for that.and for occupying a big piece of their territory till now. They have also to apologize to Bulgarians for everything they have done to them for centuries and for occupying a big piece of their territory as well.

Apologize for the deaths of Turkish citizens and any innocents (though the Israelis did what they had to do) and get over it!  Saving a relationship with Turkey is too important to let go.
Don't give the Islamists and Erdogan any more excuses.

Turkey has never apologized for the Armenian genocide during World War I. It has a fit every time it is brought up. And, it wants Israel to apoligize for something that Turkey orchestrated??? The ship came from Turkey, several members were Turkish and two Israeli soldiers were attacked and almost killed.  I thought muslims were peaceful----------NOT!!!!!!

It is time that the US kick Turkey out of NATO.  As a muslim country, it can not be trusted.  All Americans should boycott any product from Turkey and not  travel to it.  Contact the Turkish Embassy and let it know how you feel about its poor behavior.  It is either with the West or with the radical muslims.

An irreparable rift? I hope so.  Some day the US will have the guts and decency to break all ties with the filthy racist thugs in "Israel".

How can it be "legal" to mount a blockade to enforce an illegal occupation?

As long as the Islamic party rules in Turkey there will be problems. No territory that has become Islamic is supposed to go back to another religion according to Islamic theology. This is why the Palestinians will continue to refuse to admit Israel's legitimacy. It is also why the rest of the Islamic world supports the Palestinian position.

Turkey is an excellent example of why democracy is not desirable in the Middle East.  Ultimately, the Islamists use democracy to slowly but surely take control.  I am worried about Turkey's future as a US ally

Even after agreeing that Israel was alright in defending itself, the author manages to turn it upside down and blame Israel for the rift, even though Turkey allowed the blockade runner to sail from their port, with their people on it. Seems to me that Turkey should be the one to apologize to Israel and the world for allowing (and maybe orchestrating) the blockade runners in the first place.

Is the rift irrepairable?  Absolutely, but make no mistake, this is not a rift between Israel and Turkey.  This is a rift between Israel and the Gull government who went out of its way to end Turkey's longstanding relationship with Israel.  Typical untrustworthy, Muslim backstabbers.

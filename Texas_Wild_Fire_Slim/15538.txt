(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images) Wait… what? Well in the world of audio “mash-ups” anyway.

Worst Movie Opening Ever!

Chuck Nowlin, ZLX
Sep 14





 Creature opened over the weekend, but you didn’t see it. Most of America didn’t see the story of good looking people being terrorized by a “creature” in the swamps of Louisiana.It only made $331,000 in ticket sales on 1,507 screens. That’s only $220 per theater, making it the worst opening ever for a film on so many screens. That’s scarier than the guy in the rubber suit running around the swamp in the trailer.Click here to be frightened!

Podcast: Baylor/Big 12 football talk, Sept. 7, 2011
Welcome to high school football 2011! The Trib sports guys — John Werner, Brice Cherry and Jim Barnes — are pumped for the season, and they delve into several tasty topics in this season's inaugural podcast:

We're reveling in the TCU win — was it one of the best games ever at Floyd Casey Stadium?
RG3 for Heisman? — Jim handicaps the odds
Is the Big 12 doomed? Who would it have to acquire to keep it viable?

Seems like the Big 12/9/10 or whatever conference it is, is having several teams playing the "give me my ball" game.  Let us get back to the Southwest Conference and begin having football enjoyment once again. <><

Baylor is doing tam a favor this is all by design....tam didn't want to go to the sec to get their heads beat in every week...he'll they didn't win a championship in the big 12. They are not going to leave the big 12, they just Wanted to show Texas they are serious about being treated as a equal...Baylor is helping them save face for staying.

You're running out of cheese for all that WHINE. Give it up. "Vengeance is mine, say'th the Lord". Not Baylor Admin., Alumni and Fans.

In My Opinion ...




Should Baylor sue if A&M leaves the Big 12?

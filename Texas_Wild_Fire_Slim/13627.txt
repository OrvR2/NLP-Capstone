Steve King thinks there's a double standard here

(Newser) -
                                    Rep.

(Newser) -
                                    Pundits may have applauded President Obama’s jobs speech, but it doesn’t seem to have helped his poll numbers: Now 55% of Americans disapprove of how he’s doing his job, a CNN/ORC poll finds.

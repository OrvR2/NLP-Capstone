JONES FOREST CONSERVATION CENTER - FAQS









[ Print | 

 ]



1. How did Jones State Forest come to be and how has it evolved?
In 1926, a tract of forestland was purchased in Montgomery County by the State of Texas to establish 1 of 4 research/demonstration areas spread throughout the richest timber producing portions of East Texas. In 1958 the tract was renamed after W. Goodrich Jones. Known as “the father of forestry”, Jones has been credited for establishing the Texas Forestry Association and was instrumental in the establishment of a state forestry service, now known as Texas Forest Service.
2. Why is there a need for funding for a state owned forest?
Although university studies have documented a need for more public open space and educational institutions in the area are increasingly looking for outdoor educational venues, budget constraints have prevented the construction of the conservation center. Some local foundations have made contributions to this project; however, the Texas Forest Service has not received enough sponsorship to complete the project.
3. How will the center contribute to environmental learning?
Indoor and outdoor discovery areas will be located in the forest and adjacent to living, functioning, and sustainable demonstration areas. Also, there is opportunity for research, historical exploration, and social services outreach.
4. What is the Texas A&M Foundation and what is their relationship to the project?
Because the Texas Forest Service is a Member of the Texas A&M University System, TAMU's Texas A&M Foundation, a private, 501(c)(3) organization was chosen to solicit, receive, acknowledge and manage the money for this project as they do with other such education, research and service programs. It serves donors (individuals, corporations, and organizations) and the university (administrators, faculty, staff, students, and state agencies within the system).
5. How will volunteers be involved?
Initially volunteers may be involved with fundraising. Eventually, volunteers will serve as nature guides, facilitators, reception desk assistants, and demonstration area managers.
6. How will a Jones Forest Center benefit the greater Houston area and the entire State of Texas?
There are 41 institutions of higher learning within a 90-mile radius of the forest. There are over one million students enrolled in the two public school service areas adjacent to the forest.
7. What is the development plan?
The overall project is estimated to cost $20 million, and plans for a phased approach to this project have been developed. The first building phase will cost approximately $4.6 million and will include:

Future additions to this list, such as naming opportunities for individual rooms in the headquarters facility, will be included as formal design plans are finalized.

Naming donors, at their discretion, may be recognized in publications and public meetings about the center.

The flames grew larger as the fire spread and the inhabitants have lost everything they had to the flames. The wild fire has been scorched more than 3.6m acres since the end of last year. The authority sends 1,200 firefighters are on the ground, including crews from the states of California and Oregon.
Almost 1,400 homes have been destroyed in Bastrop County, The fire, which forced about 5,000 residents from their homes, remains about 30 percent contained, according to the Texas Forest Service.
“The fire didn’t really move last night,” Rudy Evenson, an information officer for an interagency team brought in by the forest service, said Thursday morning. “There’s still a lot to do.”
The National Weather Service said temperatures might play a vital role, which was dipped to near 60 degrees before dawn, but could later peak in the low 90s.
“Our temperature is going to drop down very low, which will increase our firefighting efforts dramatically. We will be able to do a lot of work,” Troy Ducheneaux, a regional fire coordinator for the forest service, said Wednesday.
David Dewhurst, acting governor, said he would sign a request that the federal government declare Texas a major catastrophic region.
President Barack Obama told Perry, the governor who left the state Wednesday to participate in a Republican presidential debate in California, that requests for additional assistance would be quickly assessed.
The White House said the president made clear that the federal government would continue to provide support to state and local officials fighting the fire.

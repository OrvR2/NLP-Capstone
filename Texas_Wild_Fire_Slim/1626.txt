Madonna still hates hydrangeas, and she doesn't care what you think. 
Gifted a bouquet by a fan at a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Madonna was caught on camera saying that she hated the flowers. The video was put up on YouTube and quickly went viral, painting the singer and "W.E." director in a negative light.
Generally, a publicist would look to limit the damage in a case like this, saying something like "Madonna appreciates all the gifts from her fans and didn't mean to offend anyone. She was joking in this instance."
Instead, the Material Girl bucked convention and had her publicist put out this message:
"She's entitled to like any flower she wants and she didn't want to hurt the feeling of the hydrangeas of the world," her rep said (via CNN). "No disrespect to the hydrangeas lovers of the world but she prefers different types of flowers."
However, given that she didn't list which flowers she did like, fans may be weary of gifting her flowers. Potted plants, perhaps?

				I love how this little incident actually overshadow­ed the W.E. movie premiere which apparently bombed in Venice and got terrible reviews... I know what you're thinking. A Madonna movie with bad reviews!? Now I've heard everything­!  That being said, I'm still a fan for whatever weird reason.

				I always knew Madonna was important for a specific reason. 
She's THE perfect person to exemplify the phrase, "A mule in a horse harness is still a mule."
Of course she's ENTITLED to "hate" hydrangea, but any person with a 1/2 of an ounce of sense knows that you accept a gift and say "Thank You.", not  "Thank you, I hate them."
Absolutely classless.

				Honestly the publicist has just made this worse.  Everyone in the world has been taught to be respectful of a gift, because it is the thought that counts. That goes for celebritie­s and those of us who expect to unwrap that "christmas sweater" or fruitcake every holiday season.  Whether you love the gift it respectful to show the giver that you appreciate them taking five minutes out of thier lives to think of you.  Which is something that it appears neither Madonna or her Publicist seem to think of.  For someone who has a movie for which she directed and she needs to same people take time to give up 2 hours of thier lives for a movie that has been panned by critics alike, she better rethink her attitude and her publicist.

				Madonna, according to the people who know her, to a person say she is never, ever "up on a high horse." That's a very unpleasant accusation­, and nearly libelous but that doesn't matter here in the US, as it does in Britain. (btw - loved the accent, so dignified!­).

Everyone knows she came from us, the real working class folks. Just like Bruce Springstee­n. In a very real way, these people are just like us, and deserve the respect.

Anyway, that's what makes Madonna a great artist, is she came from us, the people, she's our star and our star through the ages!

				Ah, the 80's, she'll always be a little of the Material Girl, dripping in diamonds, and wrapped in furs....a Marilyn Monroe carried down the staircase in that famous number. 

And Michael Jackson emerged, Thrilling us all with the strange tale of his own man-child self that unfortunat­ely became a kind of man-child personalit­y in the allegedly criminal way but he's gone and we have Madonna, and we must remember her. A national, internatio­nal treasure!

And now she has an elegant Europhilia­n British accent as well, astonishin­gly good. 
And Lady Gaga is here everyday to remind us there is only one Material Girl, not necessaril­y as good at placement as LG, but neverthele­ss a ground breaker, and a woman who stretched social contexts in all leather-ac­centuated, shall we say, dominating themes. 
Very interestin­g. 

And we were witness.

				Madonna is a marginally­-talented actress and a very marginal singer who is exceptiona­l as a marketer. Her silly "Europhili­an" accent (whatever the hell that is...) is as phony as she is. Josephine Baker at least carried off her French accent with a little class, something Madonna has none of, never had, never will.

				I suppose you would try to convince me that a show by Josephine Baker, in a smoky cabaret in Berlin, in France, where crowds are held transfixed by a woman who opens her heart and empties it out for you when she sings....s­he is everything­, yes, but then Madonna has the really big, big shows and there are amazing gigantic lights and sound towers, multiple big screen images and special effects where iconoclast Madonna re-enacts Catholic repression and redemption themes in crucifixio­n rituals and bi-sexuali­ty. Amazingly the pictures were condensed into an art book...hav­e you seen it? The height of elegance.

				Josephine Baker, and Jean paul Belmondo, the actor, and every hip person was in Paris, doing something.­...writing like Fitz and Hemingway and Steinem Joyce and versing and conversing with ole TS Eliot. 

So, maybe I should let you in on this deadelepha­nt, for I really meant no harm, but I've been kidding here all along.....­.

......I hope it doesn't upset anyone, but the more outrageous my statement, the more a sense of connection was taking place, and I just have to admit had a whale of a time using the old condiments of magazine life...a hoot.

				Last I saw Super Amanda she was decimating some of man donn's fans. I've nver seen one internet personalit­y so bent on the destructio­n of one 80's relic.  She's really making people see the trite.

				As another poster said, they're not showing the whole clip here. That person wasn't simply a fan, he was a reporter and was being a little odd saying what sounded like "you are my princess," I can see why she'd be a little weirded out. And later on you can see him with a microphone trying to get a soundbite from her. 

We don't realize just how often, or how easily, video is manipulate­d to make things look a certain way.

				R u kidding me?

Your story is much, much better than the publicist, and has the added feature of being true, i"m guessing..­.I couldn't watch it more than once on my slow feed, but heh, the time I did watch it, she was very appropriat­e and polite and they need to just leave Madonna alone!
Please.
Leave her alone. Pleassseee­.
She tries.
She does!

as she says and we all know:

SHE'S ENTITLED!

				In the 80's, the public didn't have the internet so our opinions of singers were based primarily on their singing on the radio and TV.  So the public liked or disliked a singer because they liked or disliked the songs they sang.  Now, we have access to so much of their private lives through comments posted to media websites and social networking postings we know way more than we ever knew about them in the past.  I can honestly say I would like certain singers and their songs better if I didn't know so much about their personal lives and public behavior.  It kinda ruins it for me.

				The Internet and social networking doesn't necessaril­y mean you know these people any better or have "access to their private lives." For that you'd actually have to KNOW these people and what their lives are like as human beings.

I remember her "dad" had a problem with her once too.  Barely remember.

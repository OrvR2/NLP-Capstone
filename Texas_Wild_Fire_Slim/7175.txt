						Wedded Bliss?					


				September 4, 2011, 
				Leigh Ann,
					Archived in marriage


Can anyone tell me if my house is still standing? Or have the children gone all Lord of the Flies on my husband?
Yes, I’m still gone! I’m having a great time! I may never come back!
Wait, it gets wicked cold up here in Iowa in the winters. I’m not made for that. Ok, I’ll come back soon.
But while I’m still gone and having a blast with all these amazing women up here, I have another amazing women RIGHT HERE on this blog to keep you company.
She’s my bloggy BFF and Canadian sister wife. And like any good sister wife, she’s down here helping Christian with the kids and babysitting my blog while I’m gone. Ok, maybe just the blog stuff.
Please give a warm welcome to the incredible Leighann of Multitasking Mumma! She’s getting married next year and is knee deep in wedding fantasies, plans, and the inevitable pressure that comes with it all. #sigh

__________________________


We are in the thick of planning our wedding and I am certain we’ve gotten a great head start! It’s more than a year away you guys!!
Brian on the other hand is not convinced. He thinks I have let my woman brain be swayed by “Say Yes to the Dress” and “Big Bliss” and I should have given myself three years or more to pull off what I am dreaming.
He says I’m a trickster.
That I promised him a back yard pig roast with a small gathering of friends and this is turning into glitz and spotlights.
My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding!
WHAT?
Okay it’s true. I promised pigs, sand, and t-shirts.
I told him there would only be a few people, a huge keg, and patio lanterns.
A little ditty about Brian and LEEEIIIGGHHANNN.
But then I remembered… I’m a girl and I want all the attention on me in my big white dress, my pulled back hair, my father walking me down the aisle, my child out of wedlock crying from my mother-in-laws lap, you know.. the dream?!
I want to starve myself for months before the big day in an attempt to fit into the gown of my dreams and do sit ups under my desk on my lunch break just so I can look back on my wedding photos with a smile on my face.
I want the excitement of planning.
The anxieties, frustrations, disappointments, and thrills.
The cake samples, invitation choices, table clothes and overlays, and glue stuck all over my hands from making centre pieces.
I want to carefully pick out song choices for the DJ and forbid any Taylor Swift music be played.
Most of all?
I want to fantasize about walking up the aisle towards the man I chose to spend the rest of my life with, slipping my hand into his, and beginning our journey into the next chapter together.




See how lovely she is? What a talent for mixing the hilarious with the warm fuzzies. And good call on the Taylor Swift banning.
Now go! Run! Check out Multitasking Mumma in her own territory and tell her the Genie sent you! I’ll be back on Wednesday!

Hee hee, love seeing the two Leighanns (Leigh Anns – let’s be fair) in one place!!
Leighann, I think you’re insane for wanting a big wedding but I understand the ultimate dream – to be one with your beloved. So exciting!!

This line cracked me up: “…my child out of wedlock crying from my mother-in-laws lap, you know.. the dream!” 
You let your woman brain run wild, Leighann. And enjoy every minute of it. Congrats!

Thanks for your encouragement!

I know that you want the glitz of it all but can I break it down to you…
It’s not worth it.
Seriously.
I spent a year in agony fussing about this and that and when the wedding came it was like a piss in the wind. It went by so quickly. I don’t remember anything other than he said “I do”…
When I look back on it, we surely through a kick as party for my friends and family, but what it comes down to is love. And that is all that matters. You don’t need a fancy hoopla to profess your love.
If I would have known that in 2003, we would have had  a pig roast…sans any country music as well 
Love you girl.

We aren’t going into debt for this.
We’re pulling this off for around $5,000.
Fer serious!
I have been to enough huge weddings to know that I don’t want to get in over my head.
thanks for lookin’ out for me friend!!

I had the same fantasy about the big fancy wedding, but then as it got closer and we moved forward with each step I realized I couldn’t be bothered with it. It was so much stress and it really comes down to the meaning behind it. We sure had a great wedding, but I don’t miss the stress, frustration and aggravation of it!
But getting excited about pulling the little details together? I totally get that. I felt the same way. I can’t wait to see how your wedding turns out!

Thank you!
We aren’t inviting that many people and we’re being very budget conscious so I think it will turn out really nice!

Hey, if you are looking for wedding advice . . . look no further than here.  Hell, I had two very different weddings . . . the 1st had about 300 people invited and was a totally over the top Italian wedding . . . no, I am not Italian but my soon to be ex-husband was.  My 2nd wedding was tiny . . . with less than 20 people attending the ceremony . . . held on a Friday . . . while I was 5 months pregnant.
Okay, so perhaps I am not the best example of traditional or being great at marriage but I do know this . . . make certain that you have the day that YOU want . . . not what anyone else wants.

He’s going to kill me, but I say go for the white wedding! It’s a once in a lifetime thing, you know? And it should be exactly how you dream of it. 
Enjoy the planning! And congrats again!

HEHE.. he doesn’t really get much of a say anyway.
All he gets is a live band instead of a DJ!
Thanks for your encouragement though, I’m blaming it on you!! LOL

Leighann – I’m glad you’re not doing such a big wedding that you’ll end up in debt.
For my wedding, I didn’t stress about things being perfect, I just wanted them to be “good enough” and for everyone there to have a good time.  So what happened?  My mother-in-law ended up taking on stress over it!  (And I didn’t know until quite recently, as I hadn’t read the “journal” she wrote about it until earlier this year, and we celebrated our 20th anniversary in June of this year!)
So, if any relative is having higher expectations than you about Your Big Day, recommend to them that they relax.  They may not take your advice, but at least they’ll have it.

I love multi-tasking Mumma!  Great post, LeighAnn!  Or is it LeighAnn?   
And I’ve heard about those Iowa winters, girl!  My MIL grew in in MN – same general issue.  Bleh.

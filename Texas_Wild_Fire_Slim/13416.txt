Texas cut wildfire-battling agency budget this year - POLITICO.com 

I hate to sound utterly heartless, but let them burn. 
Look, these people elected Rick Perry three times. They should feel the consequences of their voting actions. How else are they going to learn? When you were a kid and stuck your hand into a fire or onto a hot stovetop, it hurt and you learned never to do that again. The same principle applies here.
They voted for Perry, he cut funding for the Forest Service and the Fire and Rescue (cut 75% of Fire and Rescue budget, by the way) and now Texas is having trouble dealing with all these wildfires. These are the consequences, let them deal with it without federal assistance to learn what happens when you vote for someone who does what Perry did. 
Caveat emptor - buyer beware.

What follows is an excerpt from "A People's History of the Great Recession," a compilation of HuffPost Politics reporter Arthur Delaney's stories on those hit hardest by the economic crisis. This collection of Arthur's impassioned reporting, putting flesh and blood on the statistics, also marks the debut of HuffPost's entry into e-book publishing , which will allow us to delve deeply into interesting and timely topics. Look for our next title coming later this month. For more on "A People’s History of the Great Recession," check out Arianna’s latest blog post here.
INTRODUCTION: How the Rules Have Changed
On July 17, 2009, Terry Harris of Jonesville, S.C., lost her job as an executive assistant at a promotional products company. The company, she said, went belly up.
"My boss actually cried when I was let go," Harris told me during an interview in May 2011. "I have an excellent letter of recommendation from him."
In other words, Harris said, "It was purely an economic thing." She lost her job through no fault of her own.
What she hadn't figured out was why she was still unemployed and why her husband had been bounced from one wretched low-paying job to another. Why, she asked, if they both finished high school, got some post-secondary education, had solid work histories and held off on having kids, was it such a struggle to pay for things like getting the car fixed and visiting the dentist?
"I think the thing that keeps me going is knowing that we are really lucky, even in spite of the challenges that we are facing," said Harris in an email. "I can't help but feel badly for those that I know are worse off than we are. And I am truly grateful. And knowing that we are not alone helps a great deal, too. But it seems to be getting harder. Harder not to worry, not to cry, not to give up hope. We did everything right, I thought."
She was right: It had gotten harder.
President Obama, in his 2011 State of the Union address, talked about how most people could remember the good old days, when getting a job meant showing up at a factory after finishing high school. "If you worked hard, chances are you’d have a job for life, with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion," the president said, adding that he understood "the frustrations of Americans who’ve seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear -- proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game."
"They're right," Obama continued. "The rules have changed."
Indeed they have. For the past two years, I have written about the unemployment crisis as a reporter for the Huffington Post, interviewing and emailing with hundreds and hundreds of people who didn't understand where they went wrong. This book is about them.
The Great Recession started in December 2007 and technically ended in July 2009, according to the economists. Unofficially, the recession has continued, and it even seemed to be gaining steam halfway through 2011. The government's monthly snapshot of the labor market has consistently shown more than 20 million either out of work or underemployed. And in every snapshot an even scarier percentage of those people has been out of work for six months or longer.
To address the jobs crisis, the Obama administration championed more generous food stamps, unemployment benefits, tax cuts, and health insurance subsidies for layoff victims, among other things. The broader safety net prevented a record poverty rate in 2009, yet it gets no respect in Congress, where Republican and even Democratic lawmakers spent 2010 describing the unemployed as a bunch of lazy drug addicts unworthy of the federal deficit spending lavished on them.
The myth that unemployed workers would rather watch TV than look for jobs helped lawmakers take away much of the expanded safety net, and most of the rest will be rolled up soon as federal spending continues to lose popularity in Washington. In particular, it's likely that extended unemployment benefits will be dropped at the beginning of 2012 in an unprecedented abandonment of the long-term jobless during a weak economy.
The soggy housing market is a huge component of the ongoing crisis, in which millions of people are unable to afford mortgage payments on homes with shrunken values. Homeowner advocates wanted Congress to give bankruptcy judges the authority to reduce mortgage principal. The administration did little to support this policy change, opting instead to put banks in charge of a mortgage modification program that has been an utter disaster.
Of all the people feeling ripped off by the Great Recession and its aftermath, few have a better claim than the ones who complied with the application process for the Home Affordable Modification Program and then discovered that the program itself had put them into foreclosure. It's no wonder Obama could talk about dismal main drags and shuttered factories in his State of the Union speech but couldn't bear to mention the boarded up homes and "Bank Owned" signs that line the streets of many American neighborhoods.
 
As for Obama's signature accomplishment during his first term, most of the benefits of health care reform will be realized years from now. But the law created one program that launched almost immediately to give insurance to the uninsurable -- people with "pre-existing conditions." The program has literally saved lives, yet, as with the mortgage program, it won't help as many as it could, or as many as the administration said it would.
The long-term unemployed lose their health insurance, their homes, their minds. Yet for some reason, it has seemed the angriest people in America aren't the ones who've been trampled by the economy. Rather, it's the fury of well-off middle-class whites, resentful of the government's safety net, that has received the most media attention.
The millions of unemployed haven't organized or formed giant mobs like they did during economic depressions in the past, thanks largely to the stimulus programs that kept things from getting as bad as they once did. Instead, today's jobless take to the Internet. Between looking for work, they commiserate and swap stories on message boards, shout at reporters on Twitter, and lobby Congress via email. It's not enough to make them a political force, and for that reason their problems won't get solved. But their anger is there. As some of the following stories show, it does spill over occasionally.
Some jobless find solace in the stories of others in similar straits. That's why when I write about unemployment, in my stories I often ask unemployed people to email me and become sources. Knowing how stories of other people's suffering comforted them, they want to return the favor.
The stories occasionally bring victories, like when homeowners wrongly denied mortgage modifications get bank executives' attention through their press shop. More typically, the stories show the powerlessness of individual people -- people who emailed me just because they played by the rules only to discover the rules had changed.
"Good, decent people who worked hard, did everything right, believed in the American Dream have been destroyed," wrote a Californian who said her brother killed himself after job loss collapsed his financial situation.
"On the eve of my 60th birthday and without marketable skills I have no chance of ever finding a job again in the traditional economy," wrote a North Carolinian who'd been out of work nearly two years. "I am determined to survive this horror show. But my survival will not be determined by our broken economy. It’s 'think outside the box' time. Traditional methods obviously won’t work for people like me."
“I did everything right, I played by the rules, I got skills, I excelled in my job, all to no avail," wrote a New Jerseyan who said he lost his job in 2010. "I don't know what I'm going to do. All the years of both parties talking about free trade agreements and how we will retrain America was just a bunch of BS; it was easy to say all that when times were good."
After all this time talking to unemployed people, I have identified a few of the new rules. I must say, they kinda suck. Here they are:
--Don't Be Old
Terri Harris suspected age discrimination was a big reason why she couldn't find work. She wasn't even 40, but she'd developed a keen awareness of her years. She said she and her husband didn't have children because they wanted to wait till they had a more secure financial situation. Under the old rules, after all, age brought economic security for decent people.
"We wanted to wait till we could afford it, and now look -- I'm 39 last month."
And when she applied online for a job at Bojangles Famous Chicken 'n Biscuits early 2011, the application form required her to disclose her date of birth. Several big companies, including Target, Kroger and Home Depot, do the same thing. It's illegal to discriminate by age and to specify an age preference in a job ad, but it's not illegal to ask about age, though employment law experts say doing so does bear a whiff of discrimination.
Workers older than 55 are less likely to lose their jobs, but the average unemployed person older than 55 has been out of worker longer than a year. It's more like 10 months for the average jobless worker younger than 55.
Age discrimination is unbearably obvious to anyone over 50 who's been in the job market for more than a short time, but it's impossible to prove. You can't beat it. That's why it's a rule.
--Don't Be Unemployed
Employers openly discriminate against the unemployed in job postings on sites like craigslist and Monster every day. In 2010, after reporters asked, global phone manufacturer Sony Ericsson claimed its ad that said "NO UNEMPLOYED CANDIDATES WILL BE CONSIDERED AT ALL" was a mistake. The only mistake was that the ad betrayed one company's preference for workers who are wanted over ones who've been twisting the wind for too long.
It's not illegal to have such a rule, but in response to news stories about the phenomenon, state and federal lawmakers in the past year have tried to ban overt discrimination against the unemployed.

--Don't Pin Your Hopes On College
The unemployment rate for college grads is below 5 percent (what economists would call "full employment") and it never got much higher than that during the Great Recession. For high school dropouts, it's closer to 15 percent. So finishing college pays.
But this old rule's been bent. New college grads these days face a huge pile of debt and an unemployment rate near 10 percent, a sharp increase from 10 years ago. And among people who've been out of work 99 weeks or longer, a college degree doesn't mean anything. High school dropouts and grads were equally represented among the 1.4 million people out of work that long as of last October, according to the Congressional Research Service.
--Don't Expect To Make More Money At Your Next Job
Sure, nearly two years into the "recovery" the private sector had been adding jobs -- crappy ones. The National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group, reported in July 2011 that the non-so-great recovery was disproportionately adding low-wage jobs. Low-paying occupations saw growth of 3.2 percent from the beginning of 2010 to the beginning of 2011, while mid-wage jobs only grew by 1.2 percent. During the same time period, higher-wage jobs fell by 1.2 percent. In other words, there were more new jobs for retail salespeople, office clerks, cashiers and food prep workers than for machinists, managers, nurses and accountants.
The skewed job growth came after unbalanced job losses during the Great Recession."Of the net employment losses between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2010," NELP said in its report, "fully 60 percent were in mid-wage occupations, 21.3 percent were in lower-wage occupations and 18.7 percent were in higher-wage occupations."
When I interviewed him in May 2011, Bob Poropatich of Pittsburgh had been working part-time as a barista after losing his job as a manager for a major clothing retailer in 2008. He said he'd been with his former company for six years and had 30 years of experience. He has a master's degree. He'd been making $65,000 a year; as a barista, he said he made about $180 a week.
I asked him if he'd done something wrong in his life or if he'd been falling backward by chance.
"This is random and pointless," Poropatich said. "I didn't choose to age. I didn’t choose to be 59. I didn’t choose to be laid off. Every decision was made by a higher power and an HR director."
Poropatich said that in the five job interviews he'd had, he'd tried to get around the rule against being old by promising his hiring wouldn't raise a company's insurance premiums. It hadn't worked.
"I said, 'By the way, I won’t be applying for health benefits and things like that since I already have my own coverage.' They say, 'Okay, thank you.' Nobody is impressed by it. I would think that’s the biggest thing."
He said the worst moment was when his former employer came to his coffee shop.
"My ex boss, the one who laid me off, came in and ordered a venti mocha," he said. "It didn’t faze him at all. I felt like I was two inches tall. I wanted to say, 'Excuse me,' and run into the bathroom."
The following month, Poropatich landed a second job stocking shelves at a grocery store. He earned more money, but he sounded more bitter.
"Together both jobs pay me not even close to a third of what I made when I had just one job," he said.
Despite his bitterness, Poropatich maintained a sense of humor.
"I live in the city of bridges so I'd have my choice of about 20 or 30," he said. "But I couldn't jump -- I can't swim!"

				I was never without a job since high school, until I  found myself unemployed for the first time(s) twice during the past decade; in Sep. 2001 and Mar. 2008. [victim of downsizing­]

I can attest to what has been written in this article, with personal experience­!

--Don't Pin Your Hopes On College

I was always told "Get a college degree. Doors will ALWAYS be open to you!".
THAT may have been true decades ago, but doesn't seem to hold as much relevance
these day (unless, perhaps, you're on Wall Street with your MBA).

Businesses appeared to NOT want to pay a living wage for someone with 20 years experience and a degree. They were looking to pay entry level wages.

Businesses (of those I interviewe­d with) did NOT want to hire someone, such as myself, because I was "over-qual­ified" (and THIS was for a job as simple as stocking shelves).

--Don't Expect To Make More Money At Your Next Job

Tell me about it!

In these economic times, I expected salaries posted for jobs to be less than what they were
in the past. Say 15%? 25%?

I'm currently making 50% LESS than what I was at my last full time job..! [in the Computer Science field]

Adding insult to injury, my car broke down one week before I started the new low-paying job.
So, now I'm stuck with a low paying job AND a car payment; all while utilities/­food/gas go up!

				Re:  point 1, August's unemployme­nt rate for those with bachelor's degrees was 4.3% vs. 9.1% overall.  That suggests a bachelor's degree is still pretty darned important.

Re:  point 2, when unemployme­nt is high, the supply of labor is high relative to demand.  But those who have kept their skills current through lifelong learning and moved their career focus to industries with a bright future can still expect on-going salary growth throughout their careers.

Sorry to hear that things haven't worked so well for you.  Best of luck!

				I was told my entire life and I practiced this, if you work hard, including more hours than you are paid for, volunteer for extra tasks, do a great job, then you will be promoted and make more money.  Job security no longer exists.  I have had 2 companies sell out and then fire everyone.  A couple more companies had problems during the recession and again lost a job.  

The problem with losing your job is how long you remain unemployed­, basically using up your life savings.  Then companies don't want to hire you because you are unemployed­, then when you finally land a job, it's usually for the same amount or much less than what you made before.

Luckily I recently broke this cycle and am making more than I did before, but that was the first time I was able to pull this off and that was only after taking a crappy job with a crappy company.

				I'm a Federal employee currently making $80K/yr.  My salary has currently been frozen for the next 2 years and I've got a bull's-eye on my chest for more salary reductions and benefit cuts.  My companions and I keep the government running.  We don't have anything to do with the malfeasanc­e in WDC, nor do we care.  We just want to retire under the terms we hired on to.

I retire in 8 1/2 years.  I'll be 67 years old then.  I'll be lucky if I garner $1600 a month from my retirement and another $1200 from Social Security if the Republican terrorists leave it alone.  I don't want to go to work at WalMart as a part-time greeter or work at Burger King.  I still have to pay taxes on my house and utilities every month.  Not to mention, maybe leaving something for my children when I die besides a tax bill.

I worked for the past 40 years, served in the VietNam conflict and deserve to retire in dignity, not dumpster-d­iving for peanut butter that's out of date behind the local Price Chopper.  I think I'm owed something more from today's crop of politician­s beside this partisan BS.  They used to work for "we the people", but today,  I don't think so.

Time to "cross the streams" according to the Ghostbuste­rs.

				"I think I'm owed something more from today's crop of politician­­s beside this partisan BS."

See, that's the problem...­you believed you were OWED something.  You weren't.  You get what you earn.  You retire on what you've saved.  If a government program happens to remain solvent throughout your retirement­, you might live a bit more comfortabl­y.  

The promise of this country is OPPORTUNIT­Y, and despite all the whining about a tough economy, that still exists for those willing to sacrifice, invest and make contributi­ons.  There's not a promise of a free lunch so don't be whining when it isn't served up to you.

				He served in our military and worked 40 years, paying taxes to this country. He earned the right to retire with dignity, because he made his contributi­on to our countries prosperity­. There is no such thing as a free lunch, but in a country with a retirement system that he paid into and ran a surplus, until Bush borrowed against it to fund wars and lend to his CEO buddies, he deserves his far share. If by invest you mean investing in retirement accounts or investing in the stock market for retirement­, talk to the many people who put their money in the market to lose it all in 2009.

				To the unemployed­, it doesn't make any difference what the economists call it. But most unemployed were working on Main Street, not businesses listed on Wall Street. But the definition for a recession or depression is based on Wall Street and the markets. There is no measure for Main Street except a relative measure based on the unemployed­.

And Wall Street is where the government has focused with its bailouts and loans, And the dynamics of Wall Street are different. Most Wall Street businesses are global while the Main Street are based on consumer spending. Look in any telephone book at the Yellow Pages in any city in the US. That is Main street and those are the businesses hurting.

To help the unemployed­, consumer confidence must return as well as spending. To do that the federal financial crisis must be dealt with. And that means lowering the debt and focusing on a balanced budget. Jobs will follow as the economy improves.

				If you think that anyone in the prior administra­tion, or this one, really gives two cents about you, think again.

Their bosses on Wall Street have spoken, ordered up their wars, blew the biggest bubble in history, and paid congress to look the other way while they ripped us off--first with inflated prices of homes, second with predatory lending schemes, third with the bail out, and fourth, right now as they foreclose and make more of the same derivative­s that crashed the world's economy.

And here's the deal--if people like us are smart enough to see through it, don't you think they have people in DC who could too? So the question becomes, why aren't they doing anything to help us?

And the answer is because they're not done milking us dry yet.

				The Eatonville story    (Eatonvill­e, Washington­, is located in southern Pierce County, Washington State,. It is the first stop to scenic recreation areas such as Mount Rainier National Park, Gifford Pinchot and Mount Baker-Snoq­ualmie National Forests, Northwest Trek, Pioneer Farm, and Pack Forest.)

On Monday stop there for lunch. After lunch we  found a nice garden shop. upon checking out I asked the delightful owner how was business. "Just getting by". she then pulled out a brochure and crossed out four shops, broke for all four and on the last one "broke and committed suicide". I asked when was the brochure printed? A five years ago?  No last year.

				In the depression of the '30s, it is estimated that between 20 and 25% of industrial workers were unemployed­> we are nowhere that. Another difference is that many of the unemployed now were Main Street workers, not industrial workers, and in the '30, so many more people were agricultur­al and seafood based so they remained employed or were self sufficient on their farms.

Point is, times may be too different to compare. At least we don't have block long bread lines as in the "30s.in cities where industry was important.

				When I was 21 years old, you could walk up to the nearest factory (steel mill, plastics plant) employment window and fill out an applicatio­n and sell your strong back and weak mind to an employer for a good union wage.  Every town had at least one good factory that hired everybody out of high school and the middle class prospered everywhere­.

Not so anymore.  All the manufactur­ing jobs have gone to China, India, Sri Lanka, VietNam.  Industry has been important since the 1850s to America and our "Robber-Ba­rons" have sent all our industries overseas  for ever greater profits.

Enough.  Tax the corporate entities outside this country just like they were inside.  Overhaul the tax code so these greedy corporate entities that pay little or no tax, or even get huge refunds actually pay the taxes on their income that all the rest of us have to pay.

We don't have the hordes of lawyers and tax accountant­s on our payroll to avoid paying our taxes, but rest assured, your day is coming.

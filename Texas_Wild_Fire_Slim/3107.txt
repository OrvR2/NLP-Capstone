Before landing a full-time job that started last week, Ali Braswell didn't think she could make September's rent. She'd started scoping out storage options for her stuff and shelters where she could bring her two young children. 
"I was running on fumes. I really did not know what I was going to do," said Braswell, who is 40 and lives in Chapel Hill, N.C. "I believed the Lord was going to make something happen. If we were going to go into a shelter then I was going to make the best."
Braswell told HuffPost she got hired last month to do human resources and customer service work for a global IT company with a location in nearby Pittsboro. She's making less money than she used to, but she said she feels "blessed."
She'd been out of work for longer than two years after losing her job as a payroll coordinator halfway through 2009. Since then, she said she had gotten by with $480 a week in unemployment insurance benefits and about $90 a week from a part-time job as a desk attendant in a residence hall at the University of North Carolina.
The unemployment benefits lapsed for a month over the summer because of an impasse between statehouse Republicans and Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue. The standoff stopped only when Perdue issued a surprise executive order, restoring benefits to nearly 50,000 North Carolinians. (In her order, Perdue cited the experience of a single mom like Braswell: "Because she lost her benefits she and her daughter can no longer stay in their apartment. They have nowhere to put their belongings so they will also lose everything that they can carry to the homeless shelter.")
"It's such a blessing to get this money but I only have about six weeks left," Braswell told HuffPost in June. "There aren't going to be any more reprieves. Things are still dire."
Braswell said her benefits ran out at the beginning of August. Several promising leads fell through, including an interview for an administrative position that had given Braswell a good feeling. Still, she stayed positive -- something that's very difficult for people to do when they've been isolated from steady work for so long. 
 "I never started to doubt myself," she said. "I never started to feel like I’m not worth anything. I never started to doubt my skills."
Braswell said the fact that she'd been working part time made it easier for her to get hired. Indeed, many employers specify in online job ads that the unemployed need not apply, a practice decried last week by none other than President Obama. (Braswell said she's keeping a few shifts at the dorm to complement the new gig. "I get home in the evening, I've been wiped out, tired, but it feels good.")
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are more than 2 million "99ers" -- people who've been out of work for 99 weeks or longer, which is the cutoff point for unemployment benefits in the hardest hit states (technically, Braswell would not count as "unemployed" because of her part-time work -- instead she'd count as one of the more than 8 million underemployed). The Obama administration estimated last December that 4 million people would run out of benefits without finding work this year (some of those people receive fewer than 99 weeks, and some find jobs). Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist recently tapped to head President Obama's economics team, reported in a January working paper with co-author Andreas Mueller that the unemployed do not look for work more frantically when their benefits expire.
In July, John Allison of Charlotte, N.C. -- who'd been out of work almost exactly as long as Braswell -- passed the 99 week mark. Allison, 37, said he used to work as a landscaping consultant. He said he's moved in with family and that not having to worry anymore about his benefits expiring has made him more relaxed. 
"I applied for any position at an Apple retail store that is opening here next month," Alison wrote in a July 25 email. "Today I received my last unemployment check. I am now a 99er.  At 2:30 today I received a rejection email stating that Apple had moved forward with candidates that meet the needs of today. I have 15 years retail experience, 5 of which are in management, and I can't even get a part time spot with Apple retail."
Arthur Delaney is the author of "A People's History of the Great Recession," HuffPost's first e-book.

				This won't happen unless we get close to universal buy in. There are still just too damn many flawed people out there that continue, even after all of what's happened, to deny that there is anything wrong with the basic coservativ­e philosphy. It really annoys me every time I run across one of these people but reason just doesn't seem to apply with them when it comes to this. I think maybe the nation really needs to hit bottom before these people stand a chace of getting it because they need to expreience poverty and inequality first hand before they can grasp what has happened.

				Hey, once I was laid off and it took twenty months for me to get another job. They only way I ever got it was by spending as much time as possible studying my area of work so when I finally got an interview I could pass it. It was hard but and I wish I could have avoided it but, truth be told, I knew a hell of a lot more about my field than I did before I got laid off.

				If it's not obvious, i will lay it out for you all.  

This "jobless recovery" is really a serfdom creating mechanism.   For anyone who doesnt want to be a serf, you'll start a business, create an idea and build it or find a way to bridge the gaps between two ideas/comp­anies and consult...­anyone else who can't create their own opportunit­y and is just sitting around reading want ads, or craigslist is really in for a sad surprise.  

The new middle class will be those tweeners who can survive this mess, for the rest it's going to be a cleansing and there isnt anyone in government who is going to help.

				I think a lot of the unemployed and underemplo­yed are probably brilliant and skilled but don't know how to manage their resume or their interview.  Maybe reading a few articles and learning how to position their resume for the job they are applying for.  The gentleman with 5 years retail management experience needs to show he's "with it" by positionin­g his resume to show his technical experience­, same with interview skills.  Even if you don't know the field, spend an hour researchin­g the industry and learning their jargon, you'd be amazed how far it goes.
As for the rest of it...yes the economy sucks, it's horrible being unemployed­, but there ARE jobs out there, LinkedIn, indeed, facebook, and monster have thousands (if not millions) of postings.  Recruiters are looking for candidates­, VC's are still funding companies.  There's money and there's opportunit­y. Stop looking to blame people, vote them out if you don't like them.  If you see a problem, fix it, don't complain about it.  
America is STILL a great nation full of opportunit­y, but it requires the best and the brightest to make it happen.  
If you aren't drive to improve yourself, motivated to make a difference­, and passionate about success...­why do you think a company would spend precious resources to hire you?

There are no jobs out there -- if you were unemployed you would soon realize this.  And unemployme­nt continues to rise.

				Ali,

I can't help but think you are not a very bright person.  The man with 15 years experience cannot get a part time retail gig because he is OVER qualified and nobody wants to hire somebody they feel may leave the job when/if something better comes along.  As for those MILLIONS of postings you talk about, here is a news flash for you, a lot of those companies are not actually hiring OR they only want people who are currently in a job (remember the part of the article about no unemployed need apply?).  As for the websites you list, indeed actually reposts jobs from other sites, those are not additional jobs.  Additional­ly, many companies/­recruiters­/temp agencies post on multiple sites.  And clearly you don't know anything about social media because facebook is not a site to post job opportunit­ies.  Do you REALLY believe that over 9 MILLION people in this country are unemployed because they are not positionin­g their resume right or have poor interview skills?  Seriously, pull your head out of the sand and join the the rest of us in reality.

				I have no problem with reality.  Facebook does have job postings, or haven't you looked?  
Here's the challenge I keep coming across, all of this blame is going around.  Just look.  Even if the SAME job is posted multiple times, even if 4.8 people are applying for one position, there are still JOBS out there.  
If you dislike corporate so much, why are you so desperate to work for them?  Find a need and fill it.  Why wait for someone else to tell you what to do?  If you're so smart and overqualif­ied, adjust your resume accordingl­y.  If you're so intelligen­t, then why are you waiting for someone else to employ you?

				It's hard to vote someone out when the voting is rigged.  See Black Box Voting's web site.  And just how do you take a 2-4 year college degree (or more) and dumb it down for a job a McDonalds, etc.?  Because only the minimum wage jobs are available right now?

				Ali ... Your comment reminds me of the typical national news organizati­ons evening news in which they always add a "feel good" story that is suppose to make all of us take heed and find just how lucky we all are. GIVE ME A BREAK. This was a great nation until greed took the better half and religion was kidnapped by business as a means to control the middle class and make it more obedient. While the majority of hard working and country loving middle class citizens are working longer hours for less pay and their children are going off to war in hopes of getting an education in return, the rich and powerful are laughing all the way to the bank. They have us were they want us. Weak and fearful to fight back. But as with most well made plans by mankind, eventually a backlash will occur that no one will want or wish for. Your comment shows your lack of experience in the real world or the inability to see the world as it is and not as you would like it to be.

				I keep hearing blame.  Yes, there is blame to be handed out.  There is absolutely NO reason unemployme­nt benefits should exceed minimum wage.  There is absolutely every reason to serve our great country, beyond the expectatio­n of "getting something" in return.  The US was not "kidnapped by business as a means to control the middle class and make it more obedient," American's became complacent and entitled.  There are thousands of migrant workers who are picking fruit, but because Americans won't do the work.  There are jobs all across the US that are begging to be filled, but the workers they are looking for are people who are motivated, driven, and willing to work long and hard, not people who want to "get by".  America has been deadened because of people doing the minimum.  

I talk to companies every single day who are asking me if I know of people who can fill positions they have, I talk to people every day who have recruiters hounding them to fill vacant positions.  We only have 24 hours in our days and can only do one job at a time.  Not to mention taking care of our children, paying ALL of our taxes, not using ANY government benefits, and feeding the beast that entitled Americans have made this country.
There is ALWAYS a solution.  It may not be ideal, it may require sacrifice and discomfort­, but there is a solution, you simply have to be creative enough and driven enough to discover it.

He's over the hill. A forty-year­-old unemployed has about as much chance of finding a job as a woman that age has getting married.

				I'm sixty years old & I have been working since I was 15 yrs old.   As a once successful realtor, in this economy, I have no work.  As an independen­t contractor working for 100% commission­, I am ineligible for unemployme­nt. I'm not even part of the unemployme­nt statistics­.  I have been looking for work for almost 2 years and because of my age I can't find anything.  Thankfully my husband has a pretty good job  our debt is low, so we are managing to survive on half the income we once had.  Many are not so lucky.

Bandana Fever was on-hand for the Downtown Los Angeles Artwalk which is a monthly event occurring every first Thursday of the month throughout the year.  We secured a booth at The Medallion in the heart of The Art District on 3rd and Main. Thousands were in attendance to come check out and shop for some of the best art LA has to offer. There was a little bit of everything including fashion, jewelry, photography, paintings, and music. There was alive band, food, and even a mime showed up. It was like one big party with all of the vendors, artists, and shoppers enjoying the energy the atmosphere provided. Overall it was an enjoyable experience and we hope to do future events for our customers to come and partake of rock-bottom deals and one-of-a-kind samples only offered at outside venues. Seriously, we were practically giving stuff away and we had lots of things to offer. We suggest you follow us on Twitter or join our Facebook Page to keep up with where we may be exhibiting in the upcoming future.

20 Uses For A Bandana
admin, 06 September 2011, No commentsCategories: Accessories, Art & Design, BandanaTags: Adorable Images, Art Check, Bandana, Blindfold, Checkerboard, Dinner Napkin, Dust Rag, Fashion Statement, Hair Ribbon, Handkerchief, Incisions, Outdoor Adventure, Placemat, Ponytail, Stopgap, Sweat Band, Thier Heads, Washcloth, Wink Wink, X22 

We’re all familiar with the common bandana scarf, but have we really realized the usefulness of this item? Sure people tie them on thier heads all the time as a covering or fashion statement but have you ever thought how that same bandana could be used on an outdoor adventure, as decor, or as a stopgap when it comes to temporary fixing things including cuts and incisions? Examine this short list of things we’ve come up with to make use of a 22”x22” cotton scarf.
1. Scarf or Head Covering – This is the most obvious and widely used use for a bandana
2. Sweat band – You can tie the bandana around the forehead and soak up sweat
3. Hair Ribbon – You can tie the bandana around your ponytail
4. Measuring Tool – Sure. Why not? It’s 22”.
5. Blindfold – Pinata!
6. Temporary Bandage – If you’re in the wild it can come in handy for injured humans or animals
7. Handkerchief – It doesn’t always have to be a solid color, get fancy!
8. Sling – It’s 22” so you’d have to be small for this to work
9. Neck protector – No sunburn back there
10. Luggage Marker – Creative and easily identifiable
11. Washcloth – It’s not very thick, but it’s useful
12. Placemat – Decorative with the right table setting
13. Dust Rag – You’ll need furniture spray to really get the dust up
14. Food cover – It’s heavy enough to cover food and keep it warm
15. Dinner Napkin – Not as thick as most of them, but definitely more attractive
16. Ear Warmer – Everybody doesn’t have a pair of earmuffs
17. Cold Compress – Absolutely
18. Dog Scarf – You’ve all seen these adorable images
19. Racing Flag – They come in checkerboard folks
20. Belt – Fashionable
Do we sell these said bandanas at reasonable prices (wink wink)? Yep! We also take the common bandana a step further and sew them together to make new bandanas, sew them on clothing to liven them up and add color, and also sew them on shoes and accessories to create wearable art.
Check out our examples for sale.

       Since 1959, the Soviet Union which first explored the moon in a spacecraft , the world has launched more than 100 missions. The boarding party has two sister ships the Grail-A and -B Grail bound for the moon. The aim of this NASA mission is to make data more accurate to lift the gravity map of Earth's natural satellite, and combining data with topographic maps to deduce the internal structure and composition of the celestial body and its evolution. The Grail will launch after a long path through the gravitational balance point Earth / Sun Lagrange 1 and then will go to the moon to get into orbit and just at the end of year (December 31, ship, and January 1, the other). The two spacecraft have been launched at a time on a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral space base in Florida to secede once in the space and begin your trip independently, covering 4.2 and 4.3 million kilometers , respectively, to reach the moon. There, during the data collection cycles, a total of 82 days, the Grail-A and -B Grail will turn to natural satellite in formation, one after another, at a set distance (about 200 miles on average, but varying in different phases of data collection) and 50 kilometers from the lunar surface.Scientific instruments on board will measure changes in the separation between the two spacecraft to within microns (about the diameter of a cell, a red blood cell, says NASA).Knowing precisely the changes in the separation of the ships can calculate the mass distribution on the moon. In addition to these scientific teams that make up the Lunar Gravity Ranging System, the Grail-A and -B Grail MoonKam carry cameras that take pictures for education and outreach. It is expected that when completed the scientific mission (May-March 2012), both devices will crash into the lunar soil.        1 of 27        
The scientific mission to measure variations in the gravitational field, will last 82 days

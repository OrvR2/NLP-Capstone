Video: Roddick’s U.S. Open outburst forces match to move courts By      Chris Chase




At first, Andy Roddick did a fine job of keeping his cool. He had discovered a bubble caused by seeping water near the baseline of the court at Louis Armstrong Stadium and patiently listened as tournament referee Brian Earley vowed to fix the problem. Roddick and his opponent, David Ferrer, were sent off the court and waited 45 minutes while officials ensured the court was safe and dry.
It wasn't until Roddick and Ferrer returned to the court that the American lost his temper. Upon realizing the court still wasn't fixed, Roddick blew up at Earley, wondering why he and Ferrer were still on the court and how the U.S. Open could allow a match to be played under such conditions. Then he walked off the court, demanding the match be moved.
Classic Roddick.

The bubble was caused by the massive amount of rain that fell in New York over the past two days. Roddick and Ferrer were originally scheduled to play Tuesday night but had their match delayed more than 40 hours because of the weather.
After blowing up at Earley, the conversation moved to a hallway inside Armstrong Stadium.
"I realize that you may not be playing on consecutive days but the winner of us is going to have to," Roddick snapped at Earley. "So at a certain point that has to take precedence over what people can watch."
When he overheard Earley suggest Court 13 to someone on the phone, Roddick interrupted.
"Do the thing," he said. "Let's just go play. Let's go play. Thirteen. Let's go play."
The match resumed minutes later on the outside court. Before his match against Ferrer began, Roddick hadn't played a U.S. Open match oustide the 23,000-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium in nine years. Court 13 is decidedly smaller. It has seating capacity for 584 fans.

1 users disliked this comment John Moberly 6 minutes ago Report Abuse How is this a tantrum? In a game where rapid movement is paramount you can't pay on a surface that is unsafe and might be the cause of injury. The way I see it, Roddick was standing up for himself and his fellow competitor! Typical media..always trying to instigate problems where there are none!

1 users disliked this comment 10S 18 minutes ago Report Abuse Earley wasn't taking care of it. He was trying to get by and his efforts weren't adequate. If Roddick slips on that spot it could end his chances at the Open as well as his career. He could blow out a knee with a spot like that on the court.
 Roddick had obvioulsy told the referee how to deal with it. The answer was obvious and Earley was trying to wish it to get better. Earley couldn't go off on Roddick because Earley knew he was wrong. The USTA can't afford a roof but how tough is it to make the court right with good drainage and surface.

0 users disliked this comment roc_dude60 19 minutes ago Report Abuse Another athlete without a real job complaining like a spoiled brat. I heard tennis pros want a players union are you kidding me what would they strike over? Its very sad that millionaires want a union when the men and women fighting and dieing for our country have no say in what they make and what conditions they work in. There are militaries in the world that have unions so why not ours. Roddick is a has been like the rest of the USTA players and should be glad he has the skills to still play in a world class tournament maybe he should play on a public court where the surface does not bubble because its made of painted concrete.

0 users disliked this comment Slap 28 minutes ago Report Abuse Serious loser - this is what America mens tennis has turned to - Andy Friggn' Roddick who has won only one Grand Slam Singles title (what was that '03?) but acts like he is in the same conversation as Sampras, Agassi or Mcenroe.      He grand stands and bitches like he truly has done something or deserves more respect than other players.    And why?    I'm tired of watching him choke and then shooting his mouth off at analysts, judes etc...   It's obvious he hates Mcenroe... but Andrew - you couldn't hold his jock.

0 users disliked this comment E 32 minutes ago Report Abuse If I were that official, I don't think I would've been able to keep myself from going off on Roddick. I understand his argument but that little tantrum was so annoying. You could see Earley was trying to take care of it, but Andy just kept at it, like a wood-pecker on a tree. Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat!

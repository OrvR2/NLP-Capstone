Perry leaves Texas in crisis for GOP debate
The way governor handles disaster will be scrutinized
Will Weissert/ Associated Press
Austin, Texas— Gov. Rick Perry left wildfire-ravaged Texas on Wednesday and flew to California to debate his Republican presidential rivals, deciding that the chance to deliver his message to a national audience outweighed any criticism he might receive for not being at the scene of a home-state emergency. Perry's move surprised some political experts. Democrats immediately questioned his judgment. "If Perry stayed at home to work on the fires I don't think there would be any room for criticism. But this opens it up for his opponents to hit him on this issue," said Matt Angle, director of the Texas Democratic Trust, which supports Democratic candidates statewide. 
But after two-plus days of monitoring the firefighting effort and talking to residents evacuated from some of the hardest-hit areas, Perry said he could safely return to the campaign trail. He participated in a televised GOP debate in Simi Valley, Calif., Wednesday night and was scheduled to remain in the West for two days of fundraisers in San Diego, Los Angeles and Fresno, Calif., and other cities. Some Republican observers argued Perry's decision won't cost him as long as the firefighting is well-managed. Calmer winds have helped authorities gain more control of the largest blazes in central Texas, which have scorched 33,000 acres and destroyed more than 1,000 homes in the past three days alone. When asked about being outside Texas when the worst wildfires started over the weekend, Perry said, "We've been multitasking in this state for a long time." Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who is acting governor in Perry's absence, said he will sign a request that the federal government declare Texas a major disaster area. "I'm in constant communication with Gov. Perry," Dewhurst said. President Barack Obama on Wednesday telephoned Perry, assuring him that requests for additional assistance would be quickly assessed. The political risk for a chief executive who does not personally oversee disaster response was underscored in 2005 when President George W. Bush was sharply criticized for the troubled federal relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina. Since then, governors and presidents have taken a visible role at disaster sites. The wildfire response "gives Perry an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, to demonstrate decisiveness and at the same time empathy and caring," said Todd Harris, a Republican consultant. He added, however, that "you can't do anything that looks, sounds or smells even remotely political." But Perry's calculation changed as the presidential debate approached. For his campaign, it was a prime opportunity for a candidate who, while leading the Republican field in recent polls, is an unknown quantity for most voters outside Texas.

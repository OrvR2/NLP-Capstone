Layne Christensen 2Q profit leaps on mineral unitAP – 22 hrs ago





MISSION WOODS, Kan. (AP) — Drilling and construction service provider Layne Christensen Co. said Wednesday that its second-quarter earnings jumped 65 percent, driven by continued growth in its mineral exploration division.The company reported net income rose to $10.6 million, or 54 cents per share, for the three months ended July 31 compared with $6.5 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.Revenue rose 16 percent to $295.1 million from $253.3 million a year ago.Analysts polled by FactSet Research were expecting a profit of 47 cents per share on revenue of $269.7 million.Sales in its mineral exploration division jumped 36 percent to $69 million. Sales in the water infrastructure division, Layne's biggest segment, rose 12 percent to $217.7 million. The company said that unit benefited from some acquisitions last year.However, Layne said that division continues to be hurt by lower municipal spending on water infrastructure upgrades and heavy construction work.Its shares closed at $25.75 on Tuesday.

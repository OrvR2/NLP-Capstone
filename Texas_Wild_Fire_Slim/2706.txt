Wildfire Lessons


Posted: Thu, 08 Sep 2011 15:00:19 +0000
I spent the better part of the weekend monitoring the Texas wildfire situation as my husband was on call with Hays County CERT. The catastrophic wildfire in Bastrop, Texas (see how fast it spread here) has left some friends homeless and it still rages out of control. I live about 65 miles from Bastrop so [...]Wildfire Lessons is a post from: Fierce Authenticity

  




How to Become the Person You Were Meant to Be


Posted: Tue, 06 Sep 2011 15:49:51 +0000
Here’s a quickie for ya . . . I’m always on the lookout for tools that help me grow into the person I was meant to be. I tend to shy away from self-help books, yet Oprah’s web site (yep, I think Oprah rocks) has a section devoted to how to become the person you were [...]How to Become the Person You Were Meant to Be is a post from: Fierce Authenticity

  




STLV – Meeting Leonard Nimoy – A Bucket List Item Checked Off


Posted: Sat, 03 Sep 2011 15:00:29 +0000
Had it not been for the Artist’s Way, I would never have met Leonard Nimoy. The 12-week process and the support of some kindred-spirited women allowed me to replace the thought of, “I’d love to attend a Star Trek Convention, but I couldn’t possibly,” along with its attendant excuses (too expensive, I can’t get away [...]STLV – Meeting Leonard Nimoy – A Bucket List Item Checked Off is a post from: Fierce Authenticity

  




How to Look Good Naked


Posted: Thu, 01 Sep 2011 15:00:38 +0000
I’ve got about four pounds to go until I’m back down to my fighting weight. I made a decision a few months ago to leave the weight creep gang and get back down to a healthy weight. Yes, I had become a stereotype – the woman over 40 who had gradually let those 25 pounds [...]How to Look Good Naked is a post from: Fierce Authenticity

  




Why I Wanna be Dopey


Posted: Tue, 30 Aug 2011 15:00:36 +0000
It all started during a writer’s workshop. We were discussing character development and how to delve into the emotional landscape of a character to find out that character’s motivations. As I was pondering the therapeutic applications of this in my own life (what motivates my actions?) our workshop leader, the amazing David Gerrold who at [...]Why I Wanna be Dopey is a post from: Fierce Authenticity

  




What’s Your Dream?


Posted: Sat, 27 Aug 2011 15:00:04 +0000
Have you seen this? This is the Holstee Manifesto. I’ve got it framed in my home office. It’s motivated me to come up with my own authenticity manifesto – stay tuned. Holstee began as a dream of three friends – create a lifestyle that reflects their manifesto and design and curate products with inherent stories [...]What’s Your Dream? is a post from: Fierce Authenticity

  




Do you Feel Marginalized? Good!


Posted: Thu, 25 Aug 2011 15:00:42 +0000
Tara Sophia Mohr spoke at the Blogher ’11 Conference and came back pissed off because “the feminine has been so long and deeply marginalized in our culture.” I’m ashamed that I haven’t given that much thought lately. Consider the traditional feminine topics of  ”parenting, relationships, caring for the wellbeing of their loved ones through food [...]Do you Feel Marginalized?

Yep, I Narced


Posted: Tue, 23 Aug 2011 18:32:56 +0000
I just got an invitation to my 30-year high school class reunion. I’m not much on reunions and going back in time. And with Facebook, I can satisfy any classmate curiousity from the comfort of my home. I attended a private high school about the time The Preppy Handbook came out when being preppy was [...]Yep, I Narced is a post from: Fierce Authenticity

  




STLV – Costume Contest – and the Winner Is . . .


Posted: Wed, 17 Aug 2011 00:05:54 +0000
Checked off a bucket list item as I immersed myself in a sea of 6,000 Star Trek fans as they packed the Rio in Las Vegas. I’ve got photos of the best costumes along with the winner of the costume contest. You’ll notice a stormtrooper showed up – oops, wrong show, but very cool costume.

STLV – Meeting Sir Patrick Stewart


Posted: Tue, 16 Aug 2011 22:17:03 +0000
Continuing my bucket list item of attending a Star Trek convention, my photo op with Sir Patrick Stewart started bumpy as the idiot in front of me (dressed in a captain’s uniform, but with the Professor X Cerebro cap on his head and in a wheel chair), hopped out of his wheel chair and grabbed [...]STLV – Meeting Sir Patrick Stewart is a post from: Fierce Authenticity

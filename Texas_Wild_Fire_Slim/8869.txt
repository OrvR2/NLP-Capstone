Contepomi relying on youngsters in Argentina teamBy STUART CONDIE - AP Sports Writer | AP – 1 hr 5 mins ago

DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) — Felipe Contepomi is relying on the youngsters in his Argentina team to help him through his fourth World Cup.As captain and kicking flyhalf, the 34-year-old Contepomi is one of several veterans from the Pumas squad that clinched third place at the last World Cup.But Contepomi had to fight back from a year out of the game with a severe knee injury to secure a place at the World Cup. He said it is up to the younger players to ease the load upon him and the likes of loosehead prop Rodrigo Roncero and hooker Mario Ledesma."Playing my fourth World Cup is a great honor and to be captain of your country means a lot," Contepomi said Thursday. "After my injury two years ago, all I had in my mind was to be ready and fit for this World Cup, do the best I can to be competitive here."With all energy other players bring to the squad, it makes things easier."One of those players making things easier is prop Juan Figallo, who will make his World Cup debut against England on Saturday.Figallo helped Montpellier reach its first French Top 14 final this year and has trained so impressively that coach Santiago Phelan opted to drop Martin Scelzo, who like Contepomi is at his fourth tournament.The switch breaks up Argentina's most capped front-row of Scelzo, Ledesma and Roncero.Figallo, who is 12 years younger than Scelzo at 23, only made his debut last month in a warmup against Wales."We know he is a young player but he is developing very well," Phelan said. "He had very good year in Montpellier so now we think is the best option for right prop. Also he can play left."We have Scelzo on the bench, who is also a right prop in good conditions."With the switch, Phelan is hopeful his side can match its third-place finish of four years ago."It is difficult to compare because they are different teams," Phelan said. "This team has some experienced people: Felipe, Mario, Roncero, people who have three or four World Cups and also young people having their first World Cup."We all think the mix of experience and youth is good for a team."

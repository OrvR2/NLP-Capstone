                                    The 40 passengers and crew who fought back against their hijackers aboard Flight 93 on 9/11 performed one of the most courageous acts in US history, former President George W.

He looked like he got 'worst news in the world,' recalls one

(Newser) -
                                    In the let-no-stone-go-unturned spirit of 9/11 coverage,  AP  catches up with the Florida second-graders who were sitting around President Bush as he read My Pet Goat and got the news about the World Trade Center attacks.

George Bush's Failure Paved Way for Rick Perry
GOP wants a pure conservative, not a 'compassionate' one: Steve Kornacki

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry is sitting at or near the top of the GOP field mainly because of George W. Bush, writes Steve Kornacki in  Salon . But it's not just because of the obvious— that Perry became governor of Texas when Bush defeated Al Gore. "It has to do with...

Americans Down on Economy, Blame Bush
86% cite 'poor' economy; 51% say it's Dubya's fault

(AP) -
                                    Americans' views on the economy have dimmed this summer. But so far, the growing pessimism doesn't seem to be taking a toll on President Obama's re-election prospects. More people now believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, a new AP-GfK poll shows, and confidence in Obama'...

Perry's Problem: He Doesn't Think
Governor's trust in his instincts reminiscent of George W. Bush: Richard Cohen

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry officially burst onto the presidential scene just days ago, but he already "clings to an ice floe of diminishing credibility," writes Richard Cohen in the  Washington Post : Perry has quickly established himself as "intellectually unqualified to be president," most pointedly  when he sided  with...

(Newser) -

(Newser) -
                                    George W. Bush was slow to react to news of the 9/11 attacks (or, as  Reuters  describes it, had a "blank face") because he "wanted to project a sense of calm," he tells National Geographic in a new interview. Bush says his first reaction upon hearing...

(Newser) -
                                    Take heart, George W. Bush. Sure, you left office to some pretty unflattering reviews, but a tiny village in Albania positively loves you.

                                    He may not have unfurled a banner or donned a flight suit, “but make no mistake: President Obama gave his own version of a ‘mission accomplished’ speech last night,” writes Dana Milbank of the  Washington Post .

He at least had a moderate bone in his body

(Newser) -
                                    The latest GOP presidential debate gave EJ Dionne Jr. “an experience I never, ever expected,” he writes in the  Washington Post : “I had a moment of nostalgia for George W.

(Newser) -
                                    Analysts keep looking to define an Obama Doctrine, but after listening to the  president's Mideast speech yesterday , Charles Krauthammer thinks it's easy: The Obama Doctrine is the Bush Doctrine, Krauthammer writes in the  Washington Post .

(Newser) -
                                    George W. Bush says he wants to stay under the radar these days—hence  his refusal of Barack Obama's invitation  to attend a Ground Zero ceremony following Osama bin Laden’s death. But that’s not keeping him from accepting six-figure speaking engagements, and plenty of them, the  Daily...

"A nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its wealthiest members." 
--probably Gandhi
There's a disturbing sentiment that has been steadily infiltrating mainstream thinking over the last few years, namely, that in times of economic hardship, those who have more, can occasionally, briefly, almost imperceptibly do with slightly less. 
Proponents of this cataclysmic way of thinking are super-communists, secular-humanist Burning-Man attendees, and Jane Fonda.
Fortunately, for the rational among us, sketch group Funkanomics -- the same folks who realized that Bill Pullman's speech from Independence Day needed a public forum -- have answered the hysteria with a reasonable plea for help.

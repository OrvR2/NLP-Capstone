NFL will let players wear special 9/11 tribute apparel this Sunday By      Doug Farrar



The story we reported Friday morning, about the likelihood that NFL players might be fined for wearing special Reebok apparel paying tribute to the 9/11 fallen, now has a happy ending.
The league that once threatened to fine Peyton Manning(notes) $25,000 for wearing high-top cleats in memory of the late Johnny Unitas has now decided that the specter of disallowing shoes and gloves that help memorialize the 10th anniversary of 9/11 would cause the kind of public relations nightmare that even the NFL itself couldn't quite get its arms around.
Thus, this Friday afternoon tweet from NFL spokesman Michael Signora:

Of course, the players' fear that they would be fined for wearing unauthorized apparel was not unfounded. Chicago Bears linebacker Lance Briggs(notes) put this series of messages out on Friday morning after Reebok sent Briggs his gear for Sunday:
Reebok great job on these gloves and shoes..looks like I'm getting fined this week. Lol! By far the best fine I will ever have to pay. Thanks…Fines for gloves could be as much as 5k..the shoes 8-10k I think. not 100% on the shoe fine.
Other players, like Tennessee Titans quarterback Matt Hasselbeck(notes), Washington Redskins tight Chris Cooley(notes) and Kansas City Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles(notes), added their public support to the idea.
And, at least one unnamed San Diego Chargers player told Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union-Tribune that he expected to see a $5,000 fine for wearing the specific clothing — a fine he seemed happy to pay.
So, while the NFL could have jumped on this story with a bit more urgency to insure that players wouldn't assume a fine, we send kudos for not sticking to the league uniform code in a situation where an exception clearly had to be made.
The NFL is already planning a series of 9/11 remembrances, and the league and NFLPA are combining to donate $1 million to various charities and memorials. To let a simple uniform issue get in the way of issues infinitely more important would have been a real shame.
Other popular stories on Yahoo! Sports:
• NFL commissioner's tough decision in the wake of 9/11
• 9/11 prompted NFL player to retire, head to Iraq
• Why do the Diamondbacks have a giant bone in their dugout?

7 users disliked this comment michael 2 hours ago Report Abuse Oh and yahoo will not allow comments on the Mel gibson article so figured what a better place than here for my opinion.   First off Madoff was a criminal who cheated people out of billions of dollars in ponzi sceams and all Mel gibson did was make a christian movie and a few bad comments about jewish people starting all the wars which I grant you was stupid but not criminal.   It is not as if the guy was at a podium preaching hate he was a drunken idiot and ranted to police some uneducated opinions, anyway the man has payed his dues and then some and he is trying to make ammends by making this movie, lets give him a break he is not a killer or a hateful person and how can you over react and compare him to a Madoff charactor.    Remember freedom of speech America I say forgive the man instead of hanging him for a life sentance.   We have all said something we have regret but come on he has suffered enough.

If America wanted to start a War there are other ways to do so than killing it's own people and the government itself.

It's wonderful.   we should try to be united as a country, and keep praying.   I pray for everyone, and that we have a peaceful day on 9/11 this year.

Bravo.   the only thing that irks me a bit is.... "the league and NFLPA are combining to donate $1 million to various charities and memorials."... Really?   A million bucks?   Mighty generous number soming from an organization that makes billions of dollars every season.   Crack the wallet NFL and show that you are truly America's Game.

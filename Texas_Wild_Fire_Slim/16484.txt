Station Fire Path; Where's It Headed?
3 comments






The 105,000 acre Station Fire is headed east with some movement north towards Acton. As the fire continues its eastward trek it should stay in the Forest and away from populated areas.
According to GeoMac the fire appears to have crossed Highway 2 north and east of Mt Wilson. The USFS Google Earth kml overlay lags GeoMac but both mapping services indicate where the fire is headed on its eastern front.
As it looks the fire is headed towards Crystal Lake and Highway 39.
The image below is from Google Earth using the USFS kml overlay that mimics the GeoMac heat detection software.
The views below are pointing west at the advancing fire from above Crystal Lake.

NorthTree Fire International has put together this map of the fire perimeter. NorthTree is THE fire mapping service.

Tanker 979, The 747 Supetanker Expected Over Fires Today
3 comments






As yet the contracted jumbo jet supertanker has not been pressed into service. The US Forest Service passed on signing up the weapon in 2007 but this year Cal Fire smartly offered the group from Evergreen Aviation a deal.
Here is a promo video of Tanker 979 over the desert near Tucson. The 747 supertanker has a payload of 20,000 gallons. Tanker 910, the DC-10 supertanker delivers 12,000 gallons of water or retardant.

Station Fire Explodes on Eastward Track
2 comments






Current published acreage for the Station Fire is 42,000. You can see from the GeoMac image below the fire is significantly larger than that now. Although the command team says there will be no change in tactics due to the firefighter deaths I suspect that is not altogether true.
The eastern progression may be allowed to run towards Pearblossom with firefighters laying freeway sized dozers lines at some point in the forest. Dietrich will guard against runs to the west and will try to prevent the fire from doubling back to the south into Sierra Madre. In my opinion this is the biggest danger looking at the map.
WildlandFire.com has very good coverage of all new and ongoing wildfires in the state.
InciWeb publishes information directly from the incident command team. The data is updated twice daily.

Two Die In The Line Of Duty On The Station Fire
Comments Off






Station Fire officials notified the public that two Los Angeles County Firefighters died during fire suppression activities near Acton. The LA Times has details.
What makes this tragedy more sad is the two fallen firefighters may be brothers.
Deepest condolences to the family and friends of the fallen firefighters.

49 Fire Burning Multiple Structures in Auburn
Comments Off






A wildfire is burning within the city of Auburn California. The fire began mid afternoon today and quickly spread to 500 acres. Air Attack has reported multiple structures, both commercial and residential have burned and are currently burning within the city limits.
The image below represents the approximate fire perimeter. Structures have been reported burned on Locksley lane at Highway 49 as well as on Shale Ridge Lane. Notice the airport in the image below. Air Attack is centering their current suppression efforts near the large water tanks just north of the end of the runway.
There is reason to believe structures to the north of the water tanks are involved.
Update: 49 Fire in Auburn holding, though multiple structures still involved within perimeter, VLAT {very large air tanker} (747 Supertanker) canceled.

Station Fire Commander Called Out Of Retirement to Head Effort
1 comment






The Station Fire incident commander is Mike Dietrich. Dietrich who commanded the efforts on 240,000 acre Zaca fire in 2007 and the 230,000 acre Basin Complex in 2008  has come out of retirement to lead this effort.
 Dietrich and his team take a wider view of incidents of this magnitude. Expect this fire to expand well beyond the current perimeters. His resources will be deployed at the urban-rural interface with emphasis placed on structure protection, as it should be. 
Dietrich’s team was criticised by some during the Basin Complex in Big Sur for leaving many homes and one monastery to their own fate but he won’t do that with the eyes of the Los Angeles media on top of the fire. 
With resources rightfully focused on structure protection the fire will move north and east as fuel, topography and weather dictate. As the fire moves towards Acton Dietrich’s firefighters will be well positioned to save homes that are savable. 
This fire is an odd egg. It’s a Socal monster fire with no wind driving it. 
Nearly every major fire in Southern California in recent years has been wind driven. The Station Fire is feeding on drought parched fuel beds that have not burned for fifty years or more.
Where will it go? I expect this acreage to double from here with personnel working on this fire for weeks after containment. The danger is the longer there is open flame the closer we get to October when the Santa Ana winds come howling off the high desert.
————————————————-
As of this morning the Station Fire is now over 35,000 acres with minimal containment. The west head of the fire looks like it wants to merge with the 2008 Marek and Sesnon burns. To the north the fire heads towards the town of Acton in the Santa Clarita Valley. The eastern head of the fire moves unabated deeper into the Angeles National Forest.

Station Fire: Maps, News Links, More
2 comments






The best local coverage of the Station Fire and other blazes burning in Southern California is on KCAL.com.
The LA Times as usual does a fantastic job of covering the fires as well.
Of course Twitter Search is also abuzz with local insights and also where I found this time lapse video.
Time Lapse Test: Station Fire from Eric Spiegelman on Vimeo.
The fire has consumed 20,000 acres and has burned 3 homes near La Canada and dozens of cabins in the Angeles National Forest within the San Gabriel Mountain range.
4,000 have been evacuated so far as the fire works its way towards the town of Acton near Santa Clarita. With a 360 degree flame front in steep, inaccessible terrain that has not burned in over 50 years firefighters are severely challenged.
One firefighter has a heat related injury and three civilians were injured in the Big Tujunga Canyon area trying to defend their home.

Information gleaned from the ICS-209Values at Risk:

Yosemite Fire: Prescribed Burn Gone Bad
5 comments






……and the idea was poorly thought out from the start. Middle of Summer, heat wave forecast. What could go wrong?
It is called the Big Meadow Fire burning in the Foresta area. Wildland Fire guys are updating details. National Parks Traveler has some information as well.
Planning prescribed fires in Yosemite in the Summer is a dumb idea. Smoke hinders valley views and causes delays on the few roadways in the park.
It’s also irresponsible to play with fire in the middle of the tourist season.
So far 2,000 acres have burned, roads have closed, cabins are threatened, businesses are affected and most importantly firefighters and air tanker pilots are put at great risk chasing this mistake.
I’m all for controlled burning but there is a season for this, not the middle of the Summer, near the entrance of a National Park.

Athens Greece Fires in Video
1 comment






Youtube is the best source for raw footage and photo compilations for this incident.
In our country we rightfully preach safety as paramount. To that end we rarely see civilians actually manning fire hoses or beating flames with towels and branches. There is something very refreshing seeing citizens taking matters into their own hands to save their homes.  Notice the neighbors helping firefighters man fire hoses and the woman in the alley beating down flames with a stick.
[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwJSKIJ1LQU&hl=en&fs=1&]
Something else we don’t see much of in the US is fire photojournalism. Photo Journalists are always kept back by fire officials. Consider the two big fires in California this year, the 90,000 acre La Brea Fire and the 7,000 acre Lockheed Fire in Bonny Doon. I don’t recall any close up images of flames or firefighters. I’m not knocking current policy, only stating fact. It’s all about safety and control here.

A quote from the Mayor of Marathonas:
‘I fear that unless the fire is contained during the night we will see nothing left standing by sunrise,’ said Spyros Zagoris, the Mayor of Marathonas. Story
The fires are being pushed by gale force winds and aircraft was pulled for the night. Hopefully civilians have fled the region.

These fires are reminiscent of the wildfires that killed 65 people in Southern Greece in August of 2007. I blogged those fires to a great extent including posts here and here.
Greece is no stranger to wildfire but the country is poor by Western standards. The military is called on to fight the larger blazes. Homeowners do their best to protect their homes but in 2007 most of the fatalities were due to civilians staying near their homes instead of fleeing at the first hint of smoke.
In 2006 and 2007 the Russians sent a couple of their supertanker aircraft to assists the Greeks. The entire EU offered assistance in 2007.

Tanker Pilot Dies In Nevada Wildfire
2 comments






Dave Jamsa the pilot of a single engine air tanker (SEAT) died yesterday, August 20 while fighting the Hoyt Fire in northern Nevada.
This (Hoyt) fire is in a remote area east of Dixie Valley, about 20 miles north of U.S. Highway 50.  There are three “line cabin” structures reported in the area, used by local ranchers.
From the BLM release;Reno, Nev. — The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has identified Dave Jamsa as the pilot who was killed yesterday after his single-engine air tanker (SEAT) crashed while flying fire suppression operations on the Hoyt Fire.
Jamsa was an employee of Minuteman Aerial Application Inc., which is based out of Missoula, Montana, and was an employee of the company working a contract out of the BLM’s McDermitt SEAT base.
Condolences to the family, friends and co-workers of Dave Jamsa.

Lockheed Fire Wrapping Up
9 comments






Praise Cal Fire for the quick, professional and effective response to this incident. Let no one doubt this is the most remarkable firefighting force on the planet. Another textbook fire response.
Two outbuildings destroyed, a few thousand acres, no serious injuries. There was some hand to hand combat by Cal Fire and cooperating agency engine crews, dozers, hand crews, helicopter and air tanker pilots that saved dozens of homes in and near Bonny Doon, Davenport and Swanson.
Note: I think it’s funny that Fox News and the other news agencies are blasting this fire all over the airwaves as an ongoing emergency. Better really late than never. The Governor is planning a photo op near the fire lines today as well.
Proximity to the populous S.F Bay Area invited the press to the Lockheed Fire and that made it sexy.
The more interesting fire is the La Brea Fire in the Los Padres National Forest, 150 miles to the south.The closest population center to the 100,000 acre La Brea Fire is Santa Barbara.2,000 firefighters are sweating on the lines in the national forest and their contributions should be acknowledged.
Another fire burning out of control with the same proximity to the Bay Area as the Lockheed Fire is the Corral Fire near Livermore. Cal Fire surrounded that runner as well with no media fanfare.Remarkably in all three fires not one home burned!

La Brea Fire Estimated Over 100,000 Acres
2 comments






No, this is not a government estimate, draw your own conclusion as I have. The Zaca Fire burned over 230,000 acres in 2007 and took two full months (60 days) to control. The La Brea Fire has burned about a week and has consumed nearly half the acreage of the Zaca.
Look at the image below. The Zaca burn is the purple outlined area south of the La Brea. You will note the La Brea has actually entered the two year old Zaca vegetation and appears to be established in the old burn.
What can we expect from here. If the current weather pattern persists we could see the Le Brea continue its E/SE trajectory and burn all the way to Highway 33, just like the Zaca Fire. This outcome is weather dependent, little done by the fire command so far has managed to stem the rapid growth.
Please follow my Twitter updates here.

La Brea Fire Pushing East and Southeast
7 comments






Updated Image below; from Noon today
Predicatively the La Brea wildfire is moving now with the prevailing winds. This wind and terrain driven fire will continue to move east and southeast through unburned areas of the San Rafael Wilderness within the Los Padres National Forest.
The advertised acreage is just under 67,000 but figuring infills from firing operations and activity to the east ans S/E and the fire is probably closer to 80,000 acres at the moment.
GeoMac is not real time but it is the closest tool outside observers have.
Notice how the south edge of the fire is bumping along the 2007 Zaca burn. The guys are doing a great job of utilizing the repaired 2007 dozer lines and the Sisquoc Creek/River drainage.

The Pincha-Tulley team is keeping cost figures from the public. In the past this information was passed along to the public through Inciweb. I suggest they want to downplay containment costs as policy now.
For those wondering like me, where are the supertankers? That 20,000 gallon 747 is just sitting out in the Mojave desert like a pretty bridesmaid waiting to get the call.
—————————————————————-
Updated image, noon today. In the heat detection image below the software indicates numerous spots to the west, east and south. With the afternoon heating and gathering winds these spot fires will challenge firefighters who are already tired.

Latest developments in Arab world's unrestBy The Associated Press | AP – 15 hrs ago





___LIBYATripoli's military commander claims Moammar Gadhafi is cornered and the days before he is captured or killed are numbered, but another senior defense official contends that Libya's new rulers have no idea where the fugitive former leader is. The ousted leader, who ruled Libya for nearly 42 years, hasn't been seen in public for months, and has released only audio messages trying to rally his supporters and lash out at his opponents. He went to ground after opposition fighters swept into Tripoli on Aug. 21.___SYRIASyrian security forces unleash a barrage of gunfire, killing at least 11 people and leaving thousands cowering in their homes as President Bashar Assad's troops keep up the government's assault on a 6-month-old uprising. Nine of the dead are in Homs, a hotbed of opposition to Assad's autocratic regime. Two others are shot dead during raids in Sarameen in northern Syria. In a step the opposition says shows the regime is intractable, Assad's regime cancels a planned visit by the Arab League secretary general.___YEMENClashes in southern Yemen kill eight soldiers and at least three militants, and 20 civilians wounded in the fighting have to open field clinics because government hospitals have been shut down. Al-Qaida linked militants have taken advantage of internal political turmoil to take over parts of southern Yemen. The latest airstrikes target a high school, a hospital and a police station, where the military believes militants are seeking refuge.___EGYPTThe judge in the trial of Hosni Mubarak summons the top brass in Egypt's new ruling military council and his former vice president to testify in closed sessions on the ousted leader's role in putting down protests against his rule. Both the defense and prosecution in the case against Mubarak and six of his top security chiefs seek the testimony of Field Marshal Mohammed Tantawi, who was Mubarak's defense minister and is now the military ruler. The judge's decision comes in a stormy session during which a prosecution witness is detained on suspicion of perjury — but then quickly acquitted by the court.___BAHRAINMore than 100 jailed Bahraini activists, including doctors who treated injured protesters during months of anti-government protests and crackdowns in the Gulf kingdom, are on hunger strike, an international panel says. The Bahrain Commission of Inquiry says 84 opposition supporters are on hunger strike in prison. In addition, 17 detained activists have been hospitalized by the Interior Ministry for their refusal to eat. Hundreds of activists have been imprisoned since February when Shiite-led demonstrations for greater rights began in the Sunni-ruled Bahrain, the home of the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet.___ALGERIAThe countries of the Sahara, already dealing with armed militants and smugglers, are now confronted with an influx of fighters fleeing the Libyan war, Niger's foreign minister says. Mohamed Bazoum spoke during a two-day conference on terrorism in the Sahara that was originally expected to focus just on al-Qaida, but has now become tied up with the civil war in neighboring Libya. Algeria complains that the instability next door has sent a flood of weapons into hands of militants and smugglers in the desert.

Can someone explain to me how Christianity is better(or more believable) than Islam? I don't mean the people who follow it..I mean the religion itself. They're both fictional fairy tales. And it is the truth whether you thumbs up or down this comment :)

I wish everyone would read the book "The God That Hates". It would open your eyes to the futility of the muslim religion and helps one understand why muslims appear to always be angry and violent. They already live in the armpit of the world and when you add on top of that a religion that virtually enslaves the women and puts emphasis on "honor" at the expense of anything that resembles compassion or love for your fellow man. It is truly a religion of hate and that only breeds more hate,depression and anger.

Just another day in the land of Islam.  Muslims have been doing this since Islams inception in 622 AD.  Killing and Enslaveing more people world wide than any other group.  The world will never know peace as long as there is Islam.

zionists + crusaders = SOURCES of the REAL TERRORISM + SOURCES OF ATROCITIES + INHUMAN + IMMORAL + UNCIVILIZED + EVIL + DEVIL + SAVAGE + TRAITORS + TYRANTS + ILLEGITIMATE + HYPOCRITES + CHEATERS + TURDS + THUGS + INVADING THIEVES + SATANIC CORRUPTS + WAR CRIMINALS + GRAND DICTATORS + COWARDS + ZEALOTS + CRIMINAL LIARS + HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATORS + GLOBAL DEMOCRACY VIOLATORS + etc... That's just to name a FEW...

zionists + crusaders = PROTONS + NEUTRONS of the HELL NUCLEI.

zionists + crusaders = NUCLEAR FUEL for the HELL REACTORS.

Some Real Facts:

BRAVO to TUNISIA for GREATLY FAILING the 8th CRUSADE of 1270 (the proof is below).

BRAVO to EGYPT for GREATLY FAILING the 9th CRUSADE of 1271-1272 (the proof is below).

BRAVO to TUNISIA for the SUCCESS of the FIRST ARAB REVOLUTION of 2011.

BRAVO to EGYPT for the SUCCESS of the SECOND ARAB REVOLUTION of 2011.

And MUCH MORE will come...

Proof (Reference: "CRUSADES" on Wikipedia website.)

Eighth Crusade 1270
Main article: Eighth Crusade

Ignoring his advisers, in 1270 King Louis IX again attacked the Arabs in Tunis in North Africa. He picked the hottest season of the year for campaigning and his army was devastated by disease. The king himself died, ending the last major attempt to free the Holy Land.[47] The numbering of crusades is problematical. The Eighth Crusade is sometimes counted as the Seventh, if the Fifth and Sixth Crusades are counted as a single crusade. The Ninth Crusade is sometimes also counted as part of the Eighth.

Ninth Crusade 1271–1272
Main article: Ninth Crusade
Christian states in the Levant

The future Edward I of England undertook another expedition against Baibars in 1271, after having accompanied Louis on the Eighth Crusade. Louis died in Tunisia. The Ninth Crusade was deemed a failure and ended the Crusades in the Middle East.[48]
In their later years, faced with the threat of the Egyptian Mamluks, the Crusaders' hopes rested with a Franco-Mongol alliance. The Ilkhanate's Mongols were thought to be sympathetic to Christianity, and the Frankish princes were most effective in gathering their help, engineering their invasions of the Middle East on several occasions.[49] Although the Mongols successfully attacked as far south as Damascus on these campaigns, the ability to effectively coordinate with Crusades from the west was repeatedly frustrated most notably at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. The Mamluks, led by Baibars, eventually made good their pledge to cleanse the entire Middle East of the Franks. With the fall of Antioch (1268), Tripoli (1289), and Acre (1291), those Christians unable to leave the cities were massacred or enslaved and the last traces of Christian rule in the Levant disappeared.[50][51]

We used to be smart enough to outlaw the Communists and Nazis. somehow we got stupid enough to allow our enemies to build a parallel society inside America.  The Muslim world has declared a fatwa against Israel and America.  It is not with suicide bombers, Iranian Nukes, nor anthrax that America will fall into our enemies hands; but by homegrown Muslim babies that become voters. 
     In 2065, there will be more Muslim voters than all the other American voters combined. They will vote in their sharia law to replace the U.S. Constitution.  America will become another Islamic Peoples Republic.  Your great grandkids will be either Islamic or extinct.  Believing in Jihad should be outlawed as is every other attempt to overthrow the government.  Islam should be as illegal as the American Communist Party.  Islam is the "freedom go to Hell" movement...and America is becoming more Islamic everyday.

There was nothing on the ballots that said, we are just kidding when we call for the destruction of Israel. The Palestinians were well aware what the election of Hamas to power meant for the peace process. The Palestinians voted against peace with Israel. The Palestinians also voted for ending any economic ties with Israel, and in fact, voted against a productive economy in Gaza. Today e=unemployment hovers at about 50%(+/-) in Gaza, and the conditions in Gaza are a direct result of Hamas wars.

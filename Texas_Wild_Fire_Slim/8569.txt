   New Kids' Social Network Rocket21 Connects with Dot Diva to Help Girls Discover Their Potential in Computer SciencePRWeb – 48 mins ago





   Rocket21™ (the new social media network where kids explore amazing possibilities for their lives and futures) is connecting with Dot Diva to bring its program of creating an exciting and positive image of computing science to a new online audience of kids as they discover where they want to go in life.San Francisco and Boston (PRWEB) September 08, 2011  Rocket21™ (the new social network where kids explore amazing possibilities for their lives and futures) is working with Dot Diva to bring its program of creating an exciting and positive image of computing science to a new online audience of kids as they discover where they want to go in life. Dot Diva is produced by WGBH-Boston, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT). Funding for Dot Diva is provided by the National Science Foundation.  Additional funding provided by Google. 
Dot Diva was established to address the critical need for young women to study computer science. The organization seeks to change the perception of computing as boring and isolating … to a sense of empowerment and passion to use the potential of computing to build a better world.
“We couldn’t be more excited to welcome Dot Diva to Rocket21,” said Jodell Seagrave, Rocket21 President/COO. “Rocket21 is dedicated to providing tweens and young teens a safe place where they can explore their interests, passions, and dreams with real-life professionals – and the Dot Divas are all living and working at the epicenter of 21st century opportunities.  They are an amazing resource for our members. ”
“We’re extremely proud of our Dot Divas – young women who have gone into computing and made some awesome breakthroughs,” added Mary Haggerty, Manager for Educational Outreach, Dot Diva.   “Rocket21 gives kids a priceless opportunity to interact with and be inspired by our Dot Divas, just as they themselves were inspired when they were at that age.”
Dot Divas join hundreds of Rocket21 PROs - experts from countless fields who have been invited to interact with kids. These include explorers, artists, ecologists, business executives, entertainers, scientists, activists, engineers, nurses, doctors, educators, and much more – people who do some of the amazing things kids dream of doing.
About Rocket21:  Rocket21 provides unprecedented access to world-class experts and organizations while protecting them with a combination of state-of-the-art, real-time filtering and human moderation, extensive safety and security precautions, and a specialized infrastructure designed to keep kids safe.

About Dot Diva:  Developed by WGBH, ACM, and NCWIT, Dot Diva's mission is to create an exciting and positive image of computing for high school girls. Our nationwide survey revealed that not only do the majority of girls think of computing as "boring" and "hard," but they believe it fails to deliver two crucial benefits: "working with others" and "making a difference in other people's lives." Our ultimate goal is to transform this negative perception.  Like Dot Diva on Facebook or follow @DotDiva on Twitter.

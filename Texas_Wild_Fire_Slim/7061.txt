Did Gary Pinkel just ice his own kicker? Twice? By      Nick Bromberg




Arizona State 37, Missouri 30 (Overtime).
The Missouri Tigers have always found mysterious ways to lose. (Fifth Down, anyone?) And while Friday night's loss to Arizona State isn't really heartbreaking, it certainly was head-scratching.
Missouri kicker Grant Ressel missed a go-ahead 48 yard field goal with 12 seconds left after Missouri coach Gary Pinkel called consecutive timeouts before Ressel finally attempted the kick on his third try lining up. That's right: By all appearances, Pinkel was attempting to ice his own kicker in a game that the Tigers subsequently lost.
It's possible Ressel wasn't preparing to kick the ball on the first two attempts but it seems almost cruel to have the kicker line up as if he's going to kick — twice — and take a breather before attempting a long field goal.
Maybe Pinkel was attempting to draw Arizona State offside? Because it was 4th and 5, an offside penalty would have given Missouri a first down and the Sun Devils were already penalized 12 times. (Sure enough, after the game, Pinkel said he wanted to draw ASU linebacker Vontaze Burfict offside.)
But penalty possibilities notwithstanding, it was an odd time to bring the game to a screeching halt. The Tigers had just reeled off 14 points to tie the game at 30 after Jamal Miles muffed a punt and Missouri had gotten from their own 5 to the ASU 30 with ease on that final possession of regulation.
A lot of those yards on that drive were courtesy of a 39 yard run by Henry Josey, but that run was made possible by the second half emergence of quarterback James Franklin, who tossed two fourth quarter touchdown passes. Assigned with the unenviable task of succeeding prolific, NFL-bound stars Brad Smith, Chase Daniel and Blaine Gabbert, Franklin struggled in his first start, a 17-6 win against Miami (Ohio). He started slowly on Friday night, too, but finished the game 26 of 42 passing for 319 yards and and added 84 more yards on the ground on 27 carries with three of the Tigers' top four running backs on the shelf with injuries.

Even more impressive was ASU quarterback Brock Osweiler, who picked apart the Missouri secondary for 353 yards and 3 TDs on 24-32 passing. If the 6-foot-8 Osweiler — if you were watching the ESPN broadcast, you would have heard Osweiler's height referenced once a series — continues to play as effectively as he has in the first two weeks, Arizona State is very much on its way to fulfilling its sleeper billing in the Pac-12 South.

1 users disliked this comment Jeff H 2 hours ago Report Abuse I kind of like the idea of back to back TO's on your offense. Tell your kicker your gonna get 2 practice kicks. Have the center snap the ball when he hears the whistle for the time out. If the offsides ploy doesnt work then call TO with a few seconds on the play clock. The first 2 wont count but from that distance it would be nice to get a feel for the wind, distance, footing and timing.... just a thought.

4 users disliked this comment KPz 3 hours ago Report Abuse The strategy of icing the kicker has been proven to have no affect whatsoever.   Apparently Dr. Saturday missed that in his research to the piece.   Also, Pinkel stated the time outs were in an attempt to get Vontaze Burfict to jump offsides twice.   Didn't work - but if it had, you'd all be singing his praises right now...

1 users disliked this comment Oneandonly 4 hours ago Report Abuse In the 45 plus years I've been watching football whether its been high school, college, or the pros I have NEVER seen a coach call time out when his kicker is about to kick a field goal (commonly called 'freezing' the kicker).

In EVERY situation prior to this game between Arizona St. vs. Missouri normally the coach who is on defense or the team without the 'kicker' calls a time out   to 'freeze' the kicker or another words, get the kicker to think about the field goal he is about to kick.   Kind of like trying to 'pyche out' the kicker and to maybe get the kicker to think more about what he is about to attempt in hopes that he will get nervous and miss the kick.

But NEVER do you call time out when its YOUR KICKER. NEVER EVER NEVER. Did I say NEVER.   The coach not only violated an unwritten rule of calling a time out prior to his kicker attempting a field goal...he called time out TWICE.   He should be fired immediately.   What a BONEHEAD move.   The   coach is the reason Missouri lost.   Plain and simple.   I feel bad for the Missouri kicker.

1 users disliked this comment A. Veteran 4 hours ago Report Abuse Pinkel is one of the best coaches when it comes to developing players but one of the worst in just about every other respect.    First let's look at his offensive and defensive strategies:    Offense - The Spread - Flag Football with pads.   Defense -   The Rope-a-Dope - Don't stress the opposing QB or receivers - Let them wear themselves out scoring points against you and hope that the offense can pull it out in the end and look like the heros of the game.   Second let's look at balance:   All successful spread offenses have a nominal running game.   Mizzou's running game is a joke and Pinkel finds the same lame RBs year after year.   Mizzou was a RB powerhouse when I was a student.   Now they are blocking dummies.   Why?   Pinkel   is developing a rep as a QB, WR, TE coach.   Mizzou seems to be blessed with very good Ks and Ps too but more by accident that design.   Pinkel could care less about the rest of the team.    All he wants is to showcase the QBs, WRs & TEs.   So he looks for guys who can throw and catch so they can run up the numbers which is all that most people see.   Sadly, this is so obvious that it affects the morale of the team.   That or the game plans and play calling are so bad that it appears that the players are inept or bored.   You rarely see a player fight for extra yards.    You rarely see a DB pressure a receiver and who are   these guys: Toast1, Toast2, Toast3 and Toast4. They couldn't catch a cold.   They probably couldn't tackle a Mizzou RB much less an apposing WR.    I am used to in-your-face defense and steamroller offense.    No quarter asked - no quarter given.    Losing should be shameful for Pinkel but he has no vision of being National Champs much less Big-12 Champs.   Not to mention that his obsession to be in the Big-10 was what started the breakup of the Big-12 and it looks to me like Mizzou could be one of the big losers after the prime conferences cherry pick the best teams.

2 users disliked this comment Michelle 5 hours ago Report Abuse Ressel is an amazing kicker.   I think what people seem to be missing here is that its a 48 yard field goal.   His longest is 50, but still 48 is a long way.   While I'm not always on board with Pinkel's play calling, I will tell you he does know his players well and wouldn't call the time outs if he didn't think Ressel could handle it.   Our secondary lost the team for us.

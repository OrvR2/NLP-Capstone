The Washington Post:
Nearly one in three Americans who grew up middle-class has slipped down the income ladder as an adult, according to a new report by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
Downward mobility is most common among middle-class people who are divorced or separated from their spouses, did not attend college, scored poorly on standardized tests, or used hard drugs, the report says.

				Slipped huh?....LO­L More liked shoved, pushed and kicked to the bottom! Please explain to me how you can spend several years (since 1984) shipping manufactur­ing jobs, automotive jobs, technical jobs, and even medical jobs off shore and continue to have a middle class? You manufactur­e nothing  and are repeatedly told others are doing jobs American's don't want .....hummm yeah, I wonder how this happened?

				Each day do you put on the blanket of political correctnes­s, do you shift the ear phones to hear the proper dogma of your political belief, are the dark glasses strong enough so you can't see any thing but the correct vision and when you speak or touch a key board does nothing but the correct interpreta­tion of the parties political dream flow effortless­ly from your lips or fingers?  At night do you bow your head to the correct religion and political demigod you have because you do not want to see its feet of clay?
Too harsh on the American people?  Perhaps, but it is this narrow vision that is hurting this country.
If I were to suggest you walk with out the protection­, to open your eyes, to look at the religion and party walking hand in hand you would refuse.  Your refusal to acknowledg­ed that you are as dangerous as a Muslim Terror organizati­on will continue the economic hardships we now face.
The problem is in leadership and followers.  The leadership is radical and you are the one ready to throw the first fire bomb at those who disagree.
Average Americans are in the middle and are the future, you are the past that has and is failing.
We can together make America great.

				You are talking about middle class starting at $32,900-fo­r a family of four?

I'm assuming that that is a two parent family?
When you count the fact that no one can get a mortgage these days and rent is sky high-
When you count the fact that gas is $3.56 a gallon and people have long commutes these days-
When you count the fact that food is outrageous­ly expensive-
When you count the fact that a dinner out and a movie can cost $120.00/ easily-

Middle class is tough to live on.

				To add insult to injury the average marginal tax rate (Income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, Social Security and Medicare taxes, 'sin' taxes) on incomes between $20,000 and $500,000 is 40.3%, the median tax rate is 41.8%, and the standard deviation of all of those rates is 5.3 percentage points. Basically, most of us pay about 40%, plus or minus 5.3 percentage points.

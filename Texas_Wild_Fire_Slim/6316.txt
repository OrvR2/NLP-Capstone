In case all the ads splashed across store windows, magazine pages and websites didn’t explain it enough, Fashion’s Night Out is a global event aimed to promote shopping and help spur business … with a stylish twist, of course. For one night only on Thursday, September 8, stores in cities from Manhattan to Milan and London to Los Angeles stay open late and host special open-to-the-public events to get people spending while having a good time.

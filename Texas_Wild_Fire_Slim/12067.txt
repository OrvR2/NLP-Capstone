A little bit of monthly maintenance will end up saving you hundreds and easily thousands down the road.
Make it a family affair by having a “maintenance day” once a month.  Who says you have to go out and spend money to have family time?  
•Check water-purification and water-softener filters.
•Test the water-heater pressure and temperature-relief valve for proper operation.
•Clean and freshen your drains.
•Degrease and freshen your disposal using vinegar ice cubes. Pour 1 cup of vinegar into an empty ice-cube tray, fill the balance of the tray with water, and freeze until solid.
•Clean and replace air-conditioner filters.
•Check the water level of your steam system.

•Clean the filter on the interior of wall-mounted heat pumps.
•Check air intakes for insect blockages and debris.

•Clean the range-hood filter.
•Clean all appliances.
•Remove and clean range burners.
•Wash and rinse the clothes-dryer lint screen.
•Inspect, clean, and lubricate at least one major appliance per the manufacturer’s instructions.
•Deep-clean laminate surfaces.
•Clean and brighten tile and grout.
•Deep-clean all types of flooring.
•Test smoke-detector sensors and alarms.
•Test carbon-monoxide detectors.
•Test the auto-reverse safety feature on garage-door openers.
•Forced air system ducts and vacuum inside the ducts
•Inspect the foundation for any cracks
•Examine exposed wood and attic for insect damage in addition to insect preventative maintenance 
•Drain off a pan full of water from the clean-out valve at the bottom of your hot water tank (removes sediment and maintains efficiency)
•Use a pipe cleaner and baking soda to clean all drains
•Check all gutters for blockage and clean as needed (bird’s nests, leaves, etc.)
•Check and clean refrigerator and freezer coils

Putting together a home emergency preparedness kit you hope never to use may seem like a waste of time and money. But when disasters happen that are beyond your control, you can take charge of how you respond.
Items for an emergency preparedness kit
Store all items in an easy-to-carry bag or suitcase that’s readily accessible. Make sure everyone in the family knows where it is and what it contains. If you need to evacuate your home quickly, here are the essentials you’ll need for a basic “grab and go” kit:

Water: One gallon per person per day for at least three days, for drinking and sanitation; double if you live in a very hot climate, have young kids, or are nursing. Bottled water is best, but you can also store tap water in food-grade containers or two-liter soda bottles that have been sanitized. Factor in your pet’s water needs, too.

Food: At least a three-day supply of non-perishables and a can opener. Pack protein, fruit, and vegetables, but make sure they’re in a form you actually like—it’s bad enough not to have access to fresh food without also having to subsist on nothing but canned tuna. Include treats like cereal bars, trail mix, and candy bars. Store food in pest-proof plastic or metal tubs and keep it in a cool, dry place.

Flashlights and extra batteries: Candles are not recommended because there are many house fires caused by candles left unattended.

First-aid supplies: Two pairs of sterile gloves, adhesive bandages and sterile dressings, soap or other cleanser, antibiotic towelettes and ointment, burn ointment, eye wash, thermometer, scissors, tweezers, petroleum jelly, aspirin or non-aspirin pain reliever, and stomach analgesics such as Tums or Pepto-Bismol, and a laxative.

Sanitation and hygiene supplies: Moist towelettes in sealed packets, paper towels, toilet paper, garbage bags, and plastic ties. You might also want travel-size shampoo, toothpaste/toothbrush, and deodorant.

Radio or TV: Keep a portable, battery- or crank-operated radio or television and extra batteries to remain connected in case the power goes out, as well as an extra cell phone charger. You can buy an emergency radio online from the Red Cross.

Helpful extras: Duct tape, dust masks, a signal whistle, toys for kids.

Cash: Have at least $100 in your kit.
Tailor a emergency preparedness kit to your needs
Along with the basics like food and water, it’s important to have what you need for your particular situation. You may not need extra blankets in southern California, but you do need escape ladders in case of wildfire. And you’ll want extra blankets to survive a winter power outage in Maine.
Update your emergency preparedness kit regularly
Replace all food and water approaching its expiration date. Replace batteries. You might pick a specific time each year to check, such as before hurricane season in the south or after Thanksgiving if you live in the north.
Buy a pre-made kit
As an alternative to making your own kit, you can buy a fully stocked kit from the American Red Cross. A kit with a three-day supply of essentials for one adult costs $50 to $70.Wendy Paris is a New York-based writer whose work has appeared in This Old House magazine and other publications. She keeps chocolate chips on hand in case of emergency.Read more: http://www.houselogic.com/articles/make-home-emergency-preparedness-kit/#ixzz1XBP9gjiL






Labor Day

SEP

HOW LABOR DAY CAME ABOUT; WHAT IT MEANS"Labor Day differs in every essential from the other holidays of the year in any country," said Samuel Gompers, founder and longtime president of the American Federation of Labor. "All other holidays are in a more or less degree connected with conflicts and battles of man's prowess over man, of strife and discord for greed and power, of glories achieved by one nation over another. Labor Day...is devoted to no man, living or dead, to no sect, race, or nation." Labor Day, the first Monday in September, is a creation of the labor movement and is dedicated to the social and economic achievements of American workers. It constitutes a yearly national tribute to the contributions workers have made to the strength, prosperity and well-being of our country. Founder of Labor DayMore than 100 years after the first Labor Day observance, there is still some doubt as to who first proposed the holiday for workers. Some records show that Peter J. McGuire, general secretary of the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and a co-founder of the American Federation of Labor, was first in suggesting a day to honor those "who from rude nature have delved and carved all the grandeur we behold." But Peter McGuire's place in Labor Day history has not gone unchallenged. Many believe that Matthew Maguire, a machinist, not Peter McGuire, founded the holiday. Recent research seems to support the contention that Matthew Maguire, later the secretary of Local 344 of the International Association of Machinists in Paterson, N.J., proposed the holiday in 1882 while serving as secretary of the Central Labor Union in New York. What is clear is that the Central Labor Union adopted a Labor Day proposal and appointed a committee to plan a demonstration and picnic. The First Labor DayThe first Labor Day holiday was celebrated on Tuesday, September 5, 1882, in New York City, in accordance with the plans of the Central Labor Union. The Central Labor Union held its second Labor Day holiday just a year later, on September 5, l883. In l884 the first Monday in September was selected as the holiday, as originally proposed, and the Central Labor Union urged similar organizations in other cities to follow the example of New York and celebrate a "workingmen's holiday" on that date. The idea spread with the growth of labor organizations, and in l885 Labor Day was celebrated in many industrial centers of the country. Labor Day LegislationThrough the years the nation gave increasing emphasis to Labor Day. The first governmental recognition came through municipal ordinances passed during 1885 and 1886. From them developed the movement to secure state legislation. The first state bill was introduced into the New York legislature, but the first to become law was passed by Oregon on February 2l, l887. During the year four more states -- Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York -- created the Labor Day holiday by legislative enactment. By the end of the decade Connecticut, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania had followed suit. By 1894, 23 other states had adopted the holiday in honor of workers, and on June 28 of that year, Congress passed an act making the first Monday in September of each year a legal holiday in the District of Columbia and the territories. A Nationwide HolidayThe form that the observance and celebration of Labor Day should take were outlined in the first proposal of the holiday -- a street parade to exhibit to the public "the strength and esprit de corps of the trade and labor organizations" of the community, followed by a festival for the recreation and amusement of the workers and their families. This became the pattern for the celebrations of Labor Day. Speeches by prominent men and women were introduced later, as more emphasis was placed upon the economic and civic significance of the holiday. Still later, by a resolution of the American Federation of Labor convention of 1909, the Sunday preceding Labor Day was adopted as Labor Sunday and dedicated to the spiritual and educational aspects of the labor movement.  The character of the Labor Day celebration has undergone a change in recent years, especially in large industrial centers where mass displays and huge parades have proved a problem. This change, however, is more a shift in emphasis and medium of expression. Labor Day addresses by leading union officials, industrialists, educators, clerics and government officials are given wide coverage in newspapers, radio and television. The vital force of labor added materially to the highest standard of living and the greatest production the world has ever known and has brought us closer to the realization of our traditional ideals of economic and political democracy. It is appropriate, therefore, that the nation pay tribute on Labor Day to the creator of so much of the nation's strength, freedom, and leadership -- the American worker.

No Mothers-In-Law Allowed: The 7 Craziest Local Laws and HOA Rules

No Mothers-In-Law Allowed: The 7 Craziest Local Laws and HOA Rules
Get up to speed with the most outrageous laws and homeowners association rules.
   



    
It’s important to know the laws of your land and your neighborhood. Both governments and homeowners associations, or condo associations if you are a condo-dweller, can levy powerful—and sometimes incredibly strange—restrictions and requirements. Some can be pretty costly, as Pennsylvania residents recently found out with the potential new requirement for sprinkler systems in single-family homes.
Even celebrities such as Earvin “Magic” Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson can be at odds with an HOA. Here are seven crazy examples of laws and HOA rules:
1. Can’t park your car in your own driveway
In Odessa, Fla., a resident was fined by his board for parking his pickup truck in his own driveway because it wouldn’t fit in his garage. Not our problem, the HOA basically told him before slapping him with a lawsuit. After a protracted legal battle, he has since won the right to park his car, but only after two years and $200,000 in legal fees.
2. Don’t plant too many roses
While foreclosure is an increasingly real threat to homeowners, few expect to lose their house based on gardening infractions. But that’s exactly what happened to a Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., resident who planted too many roses on his property. After $70,000 in fees, he lost his legal battle against the HOA and ultimately lost his home to the flower debacle.
3. Indoor drying only
As seen in a Colbert Report expose, a Bend, Oregon, resident was shocked by her HOA’s rejection of her outdoor clothesline. Her natural drying method was dubbed a hazard, and they began levying fines that totaled nearly $1,000. She eventually took down the offending line, even after the Right 2 Dry movement got behind her.
4. No mothers-in-laws allowed
If you’re a married man in Iowa, the government grants you a special privilege: you’re allowed to bar your mother-in-law from your home. While certainly useful to men trying to ditch their spouse’s mom, this law does not extend to women.
5. Only use sanctioned paint
What appears to be an inoffensive pale blue house has caused a stir recently in one Georgia neighborhood. Unaware of his HOA’s rules, a homeowner painted his house before having the color officially approved by his board. And with a $25 per day fee levied every day his house bares the offending hue, he’s already racked up $6,800 in fines on top of legal fees.
6. No service dog for the hearing impaired
Despite the Americans with Disabilities Act, a Fort Collins, Colo., HOA fined a hearing-impaired resident for keeping Pookee, her Pomeranian service dog. The HOA even threatened to put a lien on the property.
7. Don’t use ‘inconsistent’ shingles
As if it wasn’t tragedy enough when a plane fell out of the sky destroying a Sanford, Fla., man’s home, his HOA then challenged his rebuilding efforts. It threatened litigation because the shingles and elevation in his new house’s plans didn’t match his neighbors’.
Bending the rules
If you fight the law, you may lose. But there are ways to work with the restrictions of a HOA and still get your way. The first line of defense is to make sure you understand the HOA or condo association rules before you purchase the property.
If, after you move in, you’d like your home’s appearance to differ from that of your neighbors, you’ll need to submit a “variance” form of request. This request can be accepted or rejected at the board’s will, so it’s good to alert them early in your planning process. One tip to gain HOA support? Understand the challenges and perspective of HOAs, follow the rules to a tee, and offer to help them gain community support for their initiatives. Maybe even run for office. If you can’t beat ‘em, you might as well join ‘em. What’s the strangest local government or HOA rule you’ve ever heard of?Read more: http://www.houselogic.com/articles/no-mothers-law-allowed-7-craziest-local-laws-and-hoa-rules/#ixzz1WjmI0PrP






Smart Strategies for Building a Master Closet

Smart Strategies for Building a Master Closet
By: Oliver Marks 
Done right, a walk-in closet will add convenience and value to your master suite addition, and extend the life of your wardrobe, too.




 





    




A walk-in closet should measure at least 10 by 10 feet if it's being used as a storage space for two people. Image: Easy Track
They don’t make closets like they used to. But this is a case where today’s versions are actually better than the old ones. Unless your house is fairly new or has been recently renovated, the closets are probably tiny alcoves with little more than a shelf and a pole or two for organizing your belongings.
Whether you’re adding a master suite, remodeling your bedroom, or just outfitting a large existing closet, you have an opportunity to upgrade to a modern walk-in closet that neatly stores all of your clothes gently and accessibly. Expect to pay $3,000 to $10,000 or more for a large, well-outfitted walk-in closet, assuming you hire a pro to build the room as part of your master suite addition, says Castle Rock, Colo., contractor Dean Bennett.
Layout and space requirements
A walk-in closet should be at least 7 by 10 feet, and preferably 10 by 10 feet if both halves of a couple will be using it, says Bennett. That gives you space to line two or three walls with shelves, cubbies, and poles, and the elbow room to reach them easily. For added convenience, include about 3 by 3 feet of floor space for a chair where you can perch to put on socks and fold laundry. And, if possible, leave enough room in the middle of the closet for setting up a folding luggage table, so you can lay open your suitcase when you’re packing for a trip.
Options for storage and organization
You could, of course, just move your existing dresser into your new walk-in, but that isn’t the best way to store clothes. You can only see what’s on top of each drawer, and trying to pull a shirt from the bottom of the pile always leads to a jumbled, wrinkled mess.
A far better option is a closet-organizing system. These storage units have an array of compartments, each designed for specific pieces of your wardrobe, from individual shelves for sweaters to small drawers for lingerie to cubbies for shoes and hats. Closet organizing systems cost $1,000 to $6,000 or more, depending on whether you go with ready-made or custom-designed.
The DIY option
At the low end of the price range are do-it-yourself closet kits, made from melamine (plastic-coated fiberboard) or coated wire. Installation is fairly easy—you just screw the attachment brackets to the wall and attach the shelves and poles. The hard part is planning the layout. You’ll need to measure your space, then choose modular components from the home center or at online sites like easyclosets or the Container Store. Typically, closet modules are 2 to 3 feet wide and 7 feet tall, so you need to figure out the best combination of units to fill the wall, says kitchen and bath designer David Alderman. Alderman is the owner of Dave’s Cabinet, a custom woodshop in Chesapeake, Va., and vice president of the National Kitchen and Bath Association.
“Every closet should start with four things: a shelf unit, a drawer unit, a unit with two closet poles—typically spaced about 42 inches apart—for hanging shirts and pants, and a unit consisting of a single closet pole for hanging dresses and long jackets,” he says. From there, add whatever components your wardrobe calls for that will fit in the space.
The custom-designed closet
Hire a closet company, a contractor, or a kitchen and bath designer to outfit your closet, and you’ll get a custom setup that uses every inch of space. Instead of fiberboard or coated wire, components will be made of high-density melamine or even solid wood.
You’ll also have a much wider range of storage options—jewelry drawers, tie and belt holders, shoe racks, hamper baskets—and accessories like roll-out ironing boards, lighted makeup stations, and full-length mirrors that slide out from between the shelves and swivel open for use.All those bells and whistles come with a big price tag. Alderman’s clients pay an average of $4,000 for his systems, but they can run as high as $10,000 or $20,000; one client’s came in at $75,000. To get the most for your money, Alderman advises keeping the design flexible, so you (or a future owner) can change shelf and pole heights and compartment configurations as needs change.
Lighting, ventilation, and other special features
If you’re designing a closet from scratch, consider incorporating features that add convenience and value:Laundry area. A stacking washer and dryer is probably the most desirable master closet amenity you can add. Compact units require about 24 to 27 inches of wall space.  You’ll also need dedicated electrical outlets, hot and cold water supply, and a waste line, plus a few extra feet of countertop for folding, all of which can add $3,500 to $5,000 to the job cost.Lighting. A dressing room needs plenty of light, but the classic bare bulb with a pull cord won’t meet today’s electrical codes. Your contractor can tell you the code-compliant options based on the specifics of your project, but good choices are recessed ceiling fixtures or, better still, surface-mounted fluorescent lights with protective covers, which provide the brightest illumination without generating excess heat. Ventilation. You’ll want air circulating in the closet to help expel moisture and odors that come in on clothes and footwear. But unless the exterior architecture of your house demands it, avoid windows in your walk-in. Sunlight can fade colors and degrade fabric.
Instead, include one or more heating and cooling vents to help circulate the air. If that’s not possible, you can install a simple exhaust fan, much like what’s in your bathroom, to suck stale air from the closet and expel it outdoors.

New Homestead Exemption Rules Effective TODAY!

New Homestead Exemption Rules Effective September 1st.
Dennis Blanchard 


The application process for a homestead exemption in Texas is about to grow more complex.  Earlier this year, the Texas Legislature approved new standards of mandatory disclosure for any one of several kinds of homestead exemptions.  Beginning on September 1, 2011, those new rules go into effect.
Prior to September 1, a homestead exemption was relatively easy to obtain; a property owner simply filed an application.  Now, home buyers will have to follow new rules and provide more proof they are eligible for the claimed exemption.
In order to receive a homestead exemption for property tax purposes, applicants must now provide a copy of their Texas driver’s license or Texas state-issued identification card and a copy of their vehicle registration receipt with their application for a homestead exemption.
In addition, the addresses shown on each of the documents must be the same as the address for which the homestead exemption is sought, according to the Harris County Appraisal District.
Those who do not own a vehicle will be required to submit a notarized affidavit certifying that fact and provide a copy of a current bill received from a utility company. The address on the utility bill must be the same as the address on the application for a homestead exemption.
The new requirement that takes effect on September 1 is required for any one of the several ways property owners can qualify for a residential property homestead. These include the following:

General residential exemption
Over-65 exemption
Disability exemption
100% disabled veterans exemption
Extension of exemption for a surviving spouse
Exemption for manufactured (mobile) home
Each of the programs cited above have additional requirements for qualification. However, the common standard is that all such applicants must provide the additional documentation as noted before regarding driver’s license, Texas issued identification card, motor vehicle registration and utility billing receipt.
For those seeking homestead exemption status on a manufactured home, the applicant must also provide documentation as noted below:

Statement of ownership and location issued by the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs
A copy of the purchase contract or payment receipt that the applicant is the purchaser of the manufactured home, OR, a sworn affidavit that: 

The applicant is the owner of the manufactured home
The seller of the manufactured home did not provide the applicant with a purchase contract, and
The applicant could not locate the seller after making a good faith effort
In order to avoid confusion, the modified homestead exemption form and the referenced affidavits will be posted on the effective date of the new legislation (September 1) on the website of the Harris County Appraisal District at www.hcad.org.
Applications dated and submitted to HCAD by August 31, 2011 will be processed under the pre-September 1 guidelines.






Attic Air Leaks: How to Find and Seal Them

Attic Air Leaks: How to Find and Seal Them
By: Jeanne Huber 
Even if your attic floor is filled with adequate insulation, seal air leaks around pipes and other attic openings to prevent waste of heating and cooling energy—and money.
   




An attic hatch cover improves energy efficiency and costs about $150. Image: Energy Guardian
You probably think of your ceilings as solid surfaces, but the truth is that ceilings leak air into unfinished attic spaces through gaps and openings, such as around pipes and lighting fixtures. Air leaking into your attic could be costing you money—up to 30% of a home’s heating and cooling energy is lost due to air leaks. That’s an annual $300 bite out of your wallet that you can prevent.
Find air leaks
From below your attic, check the ceilings and note the locations of all light fixtures, ceiling fans, and electrical outlets. From the attic-side of your ceiling, find the fixtures you noted. You’ll have to pull back existing insulation to find them.Electrical connections for fixtures, fans, and outlets require a hole cutout in your ceiling drywall. Each of these cutouts is a likely air leak. You can stop air leaks by sealing the cutouts from above with acrylic latex or silicone caulk, or with low-expansion polyurethane foam, depending on the size of the gap.Also check for anything that penetrates the ceiling:

pipes

vent stacks

flues and chimneys

electrical wiring

heating and air conditioning ducts

access hatch
Gaps around these locations should also be sealed from above.
Plug large gaps
Low-expansion polyurethane foam in a can is great for plugging openings 1/4-inch to 3 inches wide, such as those around plumbing pipes and vents. A standard 12-ounce can ($5) is good for 250 feet of bead about half an inch thick.The plastic straw applicator seals shut within two hours of the first use, so to get the most mileage out of a can, squirt a lubricant such as WD-40 onto a pipe cleaner and stuff that into the applicator tube between uses.
Plug small gaps
Caulk makes the best gap-filler for openings less than 1/4-inch wide, such as those cut around electrical boxes. Silicone costs the most ($8 a tube) but works better next to nonporous materials, such as metal flashing, or where there are temperature extremes, as in attics. Acrylic latex caulk ($2 per tube) is less messy to work with and cleans up with water.
Seal air leaks around flues and chimneys
Building codes require that wood framing be kept at least one inch from metal flues and two inches from brick chimneys. But that creates gaps where air can flow through. Cover the gaps with aluminum flashing ($12) cut to fit and sealed into place with high-temperature silicone caulk ($20).To keep insulation away from a hot flue pipe, form a barrier by wrapping a cylinder of flashing around the flue, leaving a one-inch space in between. To maintain the spacing, cut and bend a series of inch-deep tabs in the cylinder’s top and bottom edges.
Weatherstrip the attic access hatch
A quarter-inch gap around pull-down attic stairs or an attic hatch leaks the same amount of air as a bedroom heating duct. Seal it by caulking between the hatch frame and the rough opening, or by installing foam weatherstripping around the perimeter of the hatch opening. Or, you can buy a pre-insulated hatch cover kit for about $150.
Tips for working in attics

Work on a cool day.

Wear protective gear: disposable clothes, gloves, and a double-elastic mask or half-face respirator to protect you from the insulation.

Bring along a droplight with a fluorescent bulb, plus at least two pieces of plywood big enough to span two or three joists to support you as you work.

To save trips up and down a ladder, try to move up all of the materials you need before you get started.
One warning: If you find vermiculite insulation, hold off until you’ve had it checked for asbestos; your health department or air-quality agency can recommend a lab.

Save Water and Money with a Rain Barrel
By: Laura Fisher Kaiser 
Using rain barrels to harvest rainwater from your roof is a simple, low-expense solution for conserving water and saving on your water bill.

Why pay to pour thousands of gallons of municipally treated tap water on your lawn and garden every summer if you can irrigate for free? That’s the thinking behind the growing interest in rain barrels, which let you conserve water, protect the environment, and save money at the same time.
Considering that an inch of rain dumps 500 gallons on the roof of a typical 2,000-square-foot house, it’s possible in most parts of the country to collect more than enough runoff for basic landscape irrigation needs. A rain barrel will save about 1,300 gallons of water during the peak summer months, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
In a national survey by DC Urban Gardeners, a rain barrel lowered water bills by about $35 a month in the summer. For as little as $100 for the barrel and downspout fittings, a rain-harvesting system can pay for itself in just a couple of seasons.
How much rain can you collect?
The first step is to figure out the potential runoff amount from your roof. Multiply your area’s average annual rainfall in inches by the square footage of your roof. If you don’t know exact roof area, it’s fine to use the dimensions of your house’s footprint. Then multiply that number by 0.623—the amount of water in gallons needed to fill one square foot of space to a depth of one inch. The result is the number of gallons you can harvest. (Keep in mind, though, that most rain barrel systems are set up to collect only a portion of that, depending on irrigation needs.)If your main goal is to water flower beds or run soaker hoses during dry spells, one or two 55-gallon barrels will suffice. If you want to turn off the garden tap all together, you’ll need multiple barrels or a cistern, a large tank that stores from 300 to 3,000 gallons. But cisterns cost considerably more (up to $2,500) and are more complicated to install and use, which makes them best suited for larger-scale rain harvesting systems that include such indoor uses as flushing toilets.
The cost to set up a rain barrel system
Commercial barrels cost between $50 and $200, though you can also make one yourself from castoff food-grade containers. One couple linked together five 55-gallon syrup drums they bought for $10 apiece from the local Coca-Cola bottling plant. Their blog is an amusing and instructive rain-harvesting primer. A typical system consisting of one or two barrels and off-the-shelf parts such as spigots, downspout extensions, mesh screens, and soaker hoses costs between $35 and $600. Cobbling it all together might take a weekend or two, but it’s not rocket science. The Maryland Environmental Design Program offers easy step-by-step instructions for building your own barrel with about $15 worth of supplies. Unfortunately, most rain barrels are not very handsome, and it’s not always easy to camouflage them. Some people like the folksy wooden water barrel look, but generally speaking, the more water you’re trying to capture, the bulkier the containers—and the harder they are to make inconspicuous or tuck behind bushes, especially since they need to be located near a downspout on your house.
Safety requirements and caveats
Rain barrels work via gravity, so the barrel must be level, stable, and elevated to allow water to move out of the tank. You’ll want two spigots, one at the bottom to connect a hose and the other about two-thirds of the way down to fit a watering can or bucket underneath. If you want to move water to a higher level, you’ll have to add a small pump ($50 to $150, depending on type).You’ll also need to take a few other precautions for safety:Covers and screens: A secure cover keeps children, pets, and wildlife out. Fine mesh screens prevent mosquitoes from breeding (a mosquito dunk, which kills mosquito larvae but is non-toxic to plants or other animals, is also not a bad idea) and block leaves and twigs from clogging the works. Organic growth: Water that sits for days or weeks, especially in hot weather, can start to grow algae. Try adding a capful or two of bleach to the tank and letting it stand for a few days before using. If that doesn’t work, you may have to drain and scrub the inside periodically. Overflow: A 55-gallon barrel (or even two) will quickly fill up, especially during intense downpours. An overflow system that diverts water to a storm drain or into a moisture-tolerant part of the garden is essential. Restricted uses: Although good for plants and perfectly fine for washing cars or garden tools, water that comes off the roof is far from pure. It may be contaminated with dust, insects, bird droppings, pine needles, pollen, and other pollutants. Be sure to clearly label all rainwater-supplied fixtures as “Non-potable—Do Not Drink.” Nor is it safe to mix fertilizer or garden chemicals in the barrel, even for garden use.
Benefits that go beyond saving money
Collecting rainwater has numerous benefits apart from low-cost irrigation. Free of chlorine and sodium, naturally soft rainwater is superior for plants. Capturing roof runoff also lowers the risk of flooding and reduces the burden on storm sewers and local watersheds.
That’s one reason why a number of local and state governments are offering tax breaks or rebates for rainwater harvesting systems. A few, such as Washington, D.C., San Antonio, Texas, and San Jose, California, will even conduct a rainwater audit of your property, make recommendations, and implement rain barrels or other storm-water runoff strategies at a subsidized rate.

The secret to her Washington, D.C., garden is blood, sweat, tears, and mosquito repellent.Read more: http://www.houselogic.com/articles/water-savings-barrel/#ixzz1WcJt0ma8

Laundry Room Storage: 5 Naked Truths
By: Jan Soults Walker 
Unless you do your laundry in the buff, it’s one chore that’s never really done. Follow these laundry room storage ideas, however, and you can breeze through your dirty duds in no time.

   



    
Locate your washer and dryer as close to bedrooms as possible, and then make supplies a snap to find with these laundry room storage ideas.
1. Make space for your washer and dryer
Put your laundry room or area near bedrooms where you generate the most laundry so you can minimize steps and clothes clutter. To carve out space for a laundry station inside a bathroom or hall closet, you’ll need:

Electric outlets. Electric dryers require a 220-volt dedicated outlet. Cost: $300 to $1,000, professionally installed.

Plumbing. The washer needs hot and cold water connections as well as a drain or a hose fed into a standpipe. All dryers require a vent to the outside to exhaust heat from the drum. Gas dryers require a gas line. Cost: $300 to $550.

Space requirements. For a stackable washer and dryer, provide a minimum space of 40 inches deep and 32 inches wide. A side-by-side washer and dryer need space measuring at least 40 inches deep and 56 inches wide. 
2. Add cabinets for better laundry room storage
De-clutter by keeping laundry room necessities out of sight.

Drawer units. Front load washers and dryers are easy on your back when elevated with base pedestals, which offer drawer storage. Pedestals usually are made by individual manufacturers to fit their brand. Cost: $110 to $265.

Stock cabinetry. Home centers offer stock kitchen cabinetry that you can install above and/or beside the washer and dryer. For a laundry near the kitchen, select cabinetry that complements existing units. Cost: $130 to $350 per cabinet.

Freestanding laundry room storage. To keep clutter out of sight behind doors, position a freestanding cabinet between or beside the washer and dryer. Some armoires feature hanging space inside.

Extras. Equip a stock or freestanding cabinet with a fold-down ironing board and a holder for the iron and related supplies. 
3. Provide laundry room storage bins, baskets, and more

Bins. Canvas or solid metal bins keep small items corralled and out of sight inside a cabinet or on open shelves. Wire baskets make it easy to inventory supplies while keeping similar items together.

Lined baskets. A canvas lining provides visual appeal and prevents wicker from snagging folded linens or other items you store inside.

Pull-outs. Rather than bending and rooting around in the back of a base cabinet, equip it with a pullout hamper, wastebasket, or shelves.

Sorters and hampers. You’ll find a variety of bins for storing and sorting soiled laundry, including canvas versions with an overhead rod for hanging clothes.
4. Include easy-access surfaces

Open shelves. Melamine or wire shelves above or beside the washer and dryer provide a good spot for quickly accessing often-used supplies.

Countertops. A countertop on base cabinets or installed above a front-load washer and dryer (that aren’t elevated on pedestals) provide a place for folding clothes.
5. Create space for hanging clothes
Include a spot to hang clothing fresh from the dryer or to drip dry. For example, stretch a pole between tall cabinets flanking the washer and dryer. For compact laundry room storage spaces, look for collapsible hanging units or retractable clotheslines.Jan Soults Walker, a nationally published home improvement writer for more than 25 years, would rather hunt for flea market finds than the laundry soap.Read more: http://www.houselogic.com/articles/laundry-room-storage-5-naked-truths/#ixzz1VDRBFXUA

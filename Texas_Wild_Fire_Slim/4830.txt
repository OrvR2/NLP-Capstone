                     BASTROP, Texas — A wildfire burning southeast of Austin, Texas, destroyed about 300 homes and was advancing unchecked on Monday through parched ranchland along a 16-mile front, authorities said. The fire, one of dozens that crews were battling throughout the drought-stricken state, had blackened some 17,500 acres but was not threatening the state capital, as it was about 30 miles from the city and headed the opposite way. But the ferocity and speed with which it was moving made it unsafe to fight from the ground, Texas Forest Service spokeswoman Jan Amen said. "It's a monster, and it's zero percent...

Demonstrators Led by Alex Jones Will Again March on Texas State Capitol for TSA Bill Showdown

Author: TheAlexJonesChannel


Paul Joseph Watson Infowars.com June 27, 2011 Demonstrators led by Austin-based radio host Alex Jones will again march on the Capitol building today to protest the sabotage of an anti-TSA groping bill that was scheduled to receive a hearing on Friday but was mothballed for a second time after House members failed to show for the vote, and has now been rendered almost impotent by amendments inserted by Speaker of the House Joe Straus and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst that have gutted the bill. The protest is set to take place at 4pm CST this afternoon. Jones will lead demonstrators to the Capitol for the second month running over the TSA bill, having also protested in May after the federal government threatened to enforce a federal blockade that would have turned Texas into a de facto no fly zone to prevent the Senate from passing a bill that had already sailed through the House. Speaker of the House Joe Straus has been instrumental in stymying the passage of the TSA bill, calling the legislation an "ill-advised publicity stunt" and "unenforceable," while demanding the bill be significantly watered down, despite the fact that it already passed the House unanimously last month. According to the Texas Tribune, Straus approached the bill's primary sponsor Rep. David Simpson last week and insisted that language pertaining to "private parts" be removed from the legislation altogether, which would have completely gutted the bill. Indeed, Michael Gobart, front man for one of the <b>...</b>

BE SURE TO WATCH OUR TLC SHOW!!! We have a new special on TLC called Texas quints. It is two episodes and the premiere is Oct 11th. It will repeat throughout the month so don't miss it. In this episode, we took our family plus Rachelle's aunt Kathy to the Texas state capitol building here in Austin on Texas independence day. Some people are not aware that we actually are not technically our own nation anymore but that is OK. It gives the state character. Anyway, we got a few stares but it was pretty fun and the babies enjoyed it a lot. Either that or they were just in shock from being taken out of two or three rooms they have been in for the vast majority of their lives.

Orwellian revision of history in Texas classrooms

Order: Reorder
Duration: 11:00
Published: 2010-03-21
Author: AronRa


In his book, Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell described a corrupt government which didn't approve of its actual history, so they changed it to one which would made it easier to manipulate the populace. Religious extremists on the Texas State Board of Education now seek to do the same thing, -after having already vandalized the studies of science and health- in the name of censorship and propaganda, and in the hope that all the other states bow to the whim to Texas fundamentalists. Don't. It's time to fix this broken system. It's time to revise the system such that uneducated and unqualified political ideologues no longer oppose all the experts in every field of study we need to teach. Please review the Texas Freedom Network's campaign to de-politicize the classroom, to 'just educate' our students. www.tfn.org

The SUU Thunderbirds play Texas State in the Coliseum in Cedar City, Utah on october 3, 2009. Cade Cooper passed for 256 yards and three touchdowns and rushed for another on Southern Utah's Legends Day Saturday afternoon to lead SUU to a 38-16 win over 19th-ranked Texas State. On a day when one of the greatest quarterbacks in Southern Utah history, Matt Cannon, had his number (9) retired, Cooper and an opportunistic Thunderbird defense rallied to snap a three-game losing streak with its third straight win over the Bobcats.

AMHERST, Mass. — It wasn't just a record, it was delicious and nutritious.
Staff and students at the University of Massachusetts celebrated the start of the new semester on Monday by making the world's largest stir-fry.
Using a custom-built, 14-foot-frying pan, the 4,010-pound meal included 800 pounds of chicken, 500 pounds of onions, 400 pounds of carrots, 300 pounds of broccoli as well as peppers, green beans, bok choy, peanuts, basil and garlic. It was cooked in 50 pounds of canola oil.
Ken Toong, executive director of Auxiliary Enterprises at UMass-Amherst, says the purpose was to stress sustainability and promoting healthy eating as many of the vegetables were grown at a student-run farm.
A Guinness Book of World Records representative was on hand to certify the record. The previous record was 2,319 pounds.

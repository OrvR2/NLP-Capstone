The world still thinks Americans are "coolest": pollReuters – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

LONDON (Reuters) - They may be witnessing their global superpower influence decline in the face of challenges from other emerging players on the world stage, but Americans have been voted the world's "coolest nationality" in an international poll.
Social networking site Badoo.com (http://www.badoo.com) asked 30,000 people across 15 countries to name the coolest nationality and also found that the Spanish were considered the coolest Europeans, Brazilians the coolest Latin Americans and Belgians the globe's least cool nationality.
"We hear a lot in the media about anti-Americanism," says Lloyd Price, Badoo's Director of Marketing. "But we sometimes forget how many people across the world consider Americans seriously cool."
Of course, not all Americans are cool far from it. Some like Snoop Dogg, Lady Gaga, Samuel L. Jackson, Johnny Depp and Quentin Tarantino are way cooler than others.
Americans, however, are the dudes who invented cool and who still embody it in many fields from music to movies and TV to technology.
"America," says Price, "boasts the world's coolest leader, Obama; the coolest rappers, Jay-Z and Snoop Dogg; and the coolest man in technology, Steve Jobs of Apple, the man who even made geeks cool."
Brazilians are ranked the second coolest nationality in the Badoo poll and the coolest Latin Americans, ahead of Mexicans and Argentinians. The Spanish, in third place, are the coolest Europeans.
The French are voted cooler than the British, and Canadians cooler than the Belgians. This may come as a relief for Canadians, who are sometimes viewed as chronically uncool.
Or, as Michael Ignatieff, the Canadian politician, once put it: "Paris, Texas stands as a metaphor for broken dreams; Paris, Saskatchewan just sounds ridiculous."

Michael Ignatieff's quote just affirms his look-down-his-nose attitude regarding Canada. No wonder he couldn't get any votes. Oh, and he forgot Paris, Ontario. I guess a kinder, more polite people like Canadians aren't considered cool, but I'll go for kindness and politeness over arrogance and ignorance any day of the week.

What a stupid poll. And this line, "The French are voted cooler than the British, and Canadians cooler than the Belgians. This may come as a relief for Canadians, who are sometimes viewed as chronically uncool", annoys me to no end. I mean really, were people sitting on the edge of their seats waiting for these results? And do people actually sit around thinking of which nationality is cooler than the others? And do people really think of Canadians as "chronically uncool" - is that a thing people talk about? I'm just so annoyed over here, I feel like punching Yahoo in the face. Just the essence of Yahoo, take it and throttle it because of how much this whole article and the poll it was written about has ticked me off. And why aren't Australians on there? They're the coolest! Geez Louise, this really grinds my gears :P

First of all they should've explained what "coolest nationality" means before the poll...
The ranking looks fitting for the "coldest nationalities"

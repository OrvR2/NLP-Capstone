Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 10:46:00 +0000



Tue, Sep 13 2011, 10:46 GMT | FXstreet.com


FXstreet.com (Barcelona) – Pound retreat from 1.5885 area has extended briefly below 1.5775 low, to post fresh 7-month lows at 1.5760, although the pair bounced up shortly afterwards, returning to above 1.5800, and trading at 1.5840 at the moment of writing.
On the downside, below 1.5775 (July 12/Sept 12 lows), the pair might find support at 1.5745 (Jan 25 low) and 1.5665 (Jan 2 high). Resistance levels lie at 1.5885 (Sept 12 high) and above here, 1.6000 (Sept 9 highs/Psychological level) and 1.6085 (Sept 8 low).
GBP/JPY reversal from 124.25 highs on Friday extended yesterday to fresh long-term lows at 121.29, and the following recovery attempt has been capped at 122.65, before retracing gains again to revisit 121.25 area, which, so far, remains intact.

Forex Flash: USD/CHF: Sell at 0.9370/9399 towards 0.7067 – Danske Bank


Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 10:44:42 +0000

FXstreet.com (Barcelona) – The USD/CHF is going through a sharp recovery, yet within a longer-term bearish channel, that is meant to find resistance at 0.8848, 0.8947 and 0.0.9370/9399, where, according to the Danske Bank Research Team, the pair might set up a reversal to 0.7711.
A lower top in the 0.8848/0.9399 area might trigger a reversal to 0.7711 and 0.7067, says the Danske Bank Research Team: “currently approaching tough resistance at .8848 (38.2% retrace of 1.1730 to .7067) ahead of .8947 (13 May high / ceiling). A push through this .8848-.8947 area is needed to signal an extension higher towards .9370 – .9399 (7 May 2011 high / 50% retrace). A lower top in the .8848 – .9399 band could well set up a relapse towards .7711 (2 September low) ahead of a retest on the record low at .7067.”
Regarding trading strategy, the Danske Bank Research Team advices to sell at 0.9370-.9399: “Look to sell into the recovery towards .9370-.9399, for a relapse to .7067 and possibly the lower channel. Suggest placing a stop above .9784 or 1.0067.”

US Retail Sails expected to have weakened in August – Wells Fargo


Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 10:44:32 +0000

FXstreet.com (Barcelona) – US Retail Sales data for August, is due out on Wednesday at 12:30 GMT. The current market consensus is that of 0.2% growth (month-on-month), down from the 0.5% registered in July. Wells Fargo experts forecast a slightly lower result of 0.1%.
According to the Wells Fargo team of analysts: “Despite the tumult emanating out of Washington amid the debt ceiling standoff and the resulting loss of confidence, consumers continued to spend in July. Retail sales rose 0.5 percent, the best showing in four months, and were up 8.5 percent from a year ago. (…) However, flat payrolls in August and the first monthly decline in hourly earnings since December, along with unstable financial markets and a further drop in confidence, point to weaker retail sales for August.”

Forex: EUR/USD consolidating around 1.3600


Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 10:44:21 +0000

FXstreet.com (Barcelona) – Euro downtrend from 1.4550 highs found support yesterday at 6-month lows 1.3495, and the pair has been consolidating today, with upside moves capped at 1.3700, and the downside attempts contained at 1.3555 so far.
Resistance levels lie at 1.3695 (Sept 12 high/day high), and above here, 1.3835 (Jul 12 low) and 1.3970 (Sept 6 low). On the downside, support levels are 1.3555 (day low), and below here, 1.3495 (Sept 12 low) and 1.3425 (Feb 14 low).
On the longer-term, Gregor Horvat analyst at Elliott Wave Forecast sees the pair on an impulsive decline, heading to1.3300: “Decline from 1.4548 is considered as a powerful impulsive, but still incomplete leg, currently with a corrective wave 4 underway. We expect a completion of this pull-back in the near-term, maybe somewhere above 1.370, from where a new sell-off should occur. Our lower projected target is around 1.3300.”

GBP/USD: Pushing key support level


Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 10:42:02 +0000
The GBP/USD managed again to bounce slightly higher from the 1.5770 area, yet remains pressuring the level. The pair holds the bearish tone according to the 4 hours chart, as per 20 SMA slope still strong and limiting the upside today around 1.5900. Indicators aim for a recovery with current candle opening, yet unless a clear recovery of the 1.5920 level, the bias will remain negative.

Are Credit Unions FDIC Insured?


Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 10:40:00 +0000

NEW YORK (TheStreet) — Are credit union deposits FDIC-insured?
No, but it doesn’t matter. For starters, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. only insures deposits in banks and savings and loan associations. Federal credit unions have their own insurance fund, which is run by the National Credit Union Administration, of NCUA. State-chartered credit unions may have their own state insurance or private insurance. When you join a credit union, you don’t really make a “deposit.” Instead, you become a “member” of the credit union and the dollars you put in are called “shares.” If your credit union is insured by the National Credit Union Insurance Fund, or NCUSIF, your shares are insured in a similar way to the way bank deposits are insured by the FDIC. All federal credit unions are insured by the NCUSIF, and are required to display the official NCUA insurance sign. The summary below covers some basic NCUA insurance scenarios, but you should double-check with your credit union if you have multiple accounts in various names, to make sure you understand how much of your shares are insured.
Basic Insurance Limits
Individual accounts: For starters, share-insurance limits are per credit union and not per branch. If your shares in one or more account in one credit union total less than $250,000, they are all insured. Insurance limits increase and get more complicated when you consider joint accounts, retirement accounts and trusts. Joint accounts: The basic $250,000 limit applies also to separate ownership interests in joint accounts. So if you have a joint account with a balance of $500,000, each account holder’s ownership interest is insured up to $250,000, so the entire joint account is insured. This is separate from any individual accounts you and the other person may have. This means that if you each have individual accounts with balances of $250,000, together with the joint account with $500,000, you and the other person have total insured shares of $1,000,000. As they are for individual accounts, identically-registered accounts have their share balances added together to determine the maximum insured amounts. Trust accounts: The NCUA says that “The trust interest of a beneficiary in a valid irrevocable trust, including Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, formerly Education IRAs, if capable of evaluation in accordance with published rules, is insured” up to the $250,000, separately from the individual accounts of the grantor, the trustee or the beneficiary. This coverage is separate from and in addition to the coverage available for other accounts such as individual accounts and retirement accounts. Of course, if you are opening trust accounts for multiple beneficiaries with a credit union, it’s a good idea to review the trust documents with the credit union to make sure you understand exactly which share balances are insured.






Is the US Monetary System on the Verge of Collapse?


Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 10:38:09 +0000

This week we take in a piece that is somewhat outside my own box. There are a number of people who feel strongly that the US (and world governments in general) cannot pull out of the downward spiral they are in, that monetary policy is fixed on printing ever more money, and that the problems of fiat currencies are now coming to the fore.
I was interviewed last week by David Galland and Doug Casey of Casey Research. Those of you familiar with them know they (and especially Doug) have a strong libertarian bent and a distrust of government. Not all that unusual, of course, except that they work at finding ways to invest based on their philosophy. That has meant a lot of gold and natural resources, plus new tech, which has worked at rather well overall.
In the interview, I was the “optimist.” By that I mean I was the guy who thinks the US government will do what is necessary to bring down the deficit beginning in 2013. David pointedly asked, “So you mean your ‘optimism’ is based on your faith that the US political leaders will do the right thing?” And the blunt answer is, “Yes, because not doing it would be a disaster, and I think, based on conversations with some of them, that they actually get that.”
Which is the case I outlined in my book, Endgame.But if I am wrong and we do not deal with the deficit in a controlled manner, then all bets are off. Sadly, the guys at Casey would be right. So, today’s Outside the Box is an op-ed from David Galland.

I think this week we’re going to be focused on Europe. I am getting ready for my trip there at the end of next week, so I am reading more about the situation there to prepare myself. But right now let’s focus on the US.
Is the US Monetary System on the Verge of Collapse?
By David Galland of Casey Research
Tune into CNBC or click onto any of the dozens of mainstream financial news sites, and you’ll find an endless array of opinions on the latest wiggle in equity, bond and commodities markets. As often as not, you’ll find those opinions nestled side by side with authoritative analysis on the outlook for the economy, complete with the author’s carefully studied judgment on the best way forward.
Lost in all the noise, however, is any recognition that the US monetary system – and by extension, that of much of the developed world – may very well be on the verge of collapse. Falling back on metaphor, while the world’s many financial experts and economists sit around arguing about the direction of the ship of state, most are missing the point that the ship has already hit an iceberg and is taking on water fast.
Yet if you were to raise your hand to ask 99% of the financial intelligentsia whether we might be on the verge of a failure of the dollar-based world monetary system, the response would be thinly veiled derision. Because, as we all know, such a thing is unimaginable!
Think again.
Monetary Madness
Honestly describing the current monetary system of the United States in just a few words, you could do far worse than stating that it is“money from nothing, cash ex nihilo.”
That’s because for the last 40 years – since Nixon canceled the dollar’s gold convertibility in 1971 – the global monetary system has been based on nothing more tangible than politicians’ promises not to print too much.
Unconstrained, the politicians used the gift of being able to create money out of nothing to launch a parade of politically popular programs, each employing fresh brigades of bureaucrats, with no regard to affordability.
Such programs invariably surged during political campaigns and on downward slopes in the business cycle when politicians hearing the cries of the constituency to “do something” tossed any concern about balancing budgets out the window of expediency. After all, the power to print up the funds for debt service whenever needed makes moot any concern over deficit spending.
Former VP Cheney, who fashions himself a fiscal conservative, let the mask drop when, in 2002, he stated that “Reagan proved deficits don’t matter.”
Those words were echoed just a few weeks ago, when both former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and Obama economic advisor Larry Summers, in separate interviews, said almost the same, paraphrased as, “There is no chance of the US defaulting on its bonds, not when our government can borrow dollars and print new dollars to meet any future obligations.”
Of course, Greenspan and Summers were referring to an overt default – of just not paying – and not to a covert default engineered by inflation. Unfortunately, like virtually all of the power elite, both miss the point that the mountain of debt that has been heaped up since 1971 is fast reaching the point of collapsing like a too-big tailings pile and taking the monetary system down with it.

Importantly, the debt shown in this chart whistles past the government’s unfunded liabilities, in particular for the Social Security and Medicare systems. Adding those would more than triple the US government’s acknowledged obligations – to over $60 trillion.
Given the role the US dollar plays as the world’s de facto reserve currency – with all major commodities priced in dollars, and dollars forming the bulk of reserves held by foreign central banks –the dismal shape of the US monetary system spells trouble for the global monetary system.
Making matters worse, following the lead of the United States, governments around the world long ago adopted similar fiat monetary systems. You can see the deficit contagion in this next chart. It is worth noting that the dire condition of the United States now leaves it in the same muddy wallow as Europe’s desperate PIIGS.

In a recent article in The Telegraph, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard referenced a paper out of the BIS that paints the picture using appropriately stark terms.
Stephen Cecchetti and his team at the Bank for International Settlements have written the definitive paper rebutting the pied pipers of ever-escalating credit.
“The debt problems facing advanced economies are even worse than we thought.”
The basic facts are that combined debt in the rich club has risen from 165pc of GDP thirty years ago to 310pc today, led by Japan at 456pc and Portugal at 363pc.
“Debt is rising to points that are above anything we have seen, except during major wars. Public debt ratios are currently on an explosive path in a number of countries. These countries will need to implement drastic policy changes. Stabilization might not be enough.”
Viewing the situation from another perspective, we turn to the work of Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff, who studied the factors contributing to 29 past sovereign defaults. They found that default or debt restructuring occurred, on average, when external debt reached 73% of gross national product (GNP) and 239% of exports. Using the Reinhart/Rogoff findings, Casey Research Chief Economist Bud Conrad prepared the following chart showing that the US government is already far along on the path to bankruptcy.

It’s hard to argue against the contention that the situation is, to be polite, precarious. Given that the obligations of the US government, as well as most of the world’s other large economies, are now impossible to repay and that their reserves are just IOUs backed by nothing, the stage is set for a highly disruptive but entirely necessary do-over of the fiat monetary system.
“Preposterous!” say the lords of finance and masters of all.
Is it?
Of course, these very same mavens completely missed the looming housing crash and the depth and duration of the subsequent crisis – a crisis that is still far from over. In other words, listen to them at your peril, because in our view it’s essential in calibrating your financial affairs to understand that, if history is any guide, we are now well down the road to a collapse in the monetary system.
In fact, over its relatively short history, the US monetary system has come unglued time and time again thanks to politically expedient attempts to interfere with the workings of a free market in order to reward constituents or kick the can on the economic problems of the day down the road.
Thus it is our contention that while the mainstream media focus on the daily gyrations of equity markets or the futile political charade that is Washington, they overlook powerful tectonic rumblings indicating the world’s prevailing monetary system is about to fracture.
A Brief Timeline of US Monetary System Failures
Here’s a brief history of past disruptions here in the United States. Importantly, with the US dollar now the de facto reserve currency of the world, this time around it’s global.
1861 – When the Civil War begins, the dollar is convertible into gold and silver.
1862 – Congress passes the Legal Tender Act and authorizes the issuance of non-redeemable “Greenback” currency. Convertibility into gold and silver is suspended for all US currency.
1863 – National Banking Act authorizes the chartering of banks by the federal government.
1865 – A 10% tax is levied on the issuance of bank notes by state-chartered banks, effectively ending that practice.
1879 – The US Treasury resumes redeeming dollars for gold and silver.

1900 – Passage of the Gold Standard Act, adopting the gold standard by the United States and demonetizing silver.
Specifically, the act provided for “…the dollar consisting of twenty-five and eight-tenths grains (1.67 g) of gold nine-tenths fine, as established by section thirty-five hundred and eleven of the Revised Statutes of the United States, shall be the standard unit of value, and all forms of money issued or coined by the United States shall be maintained at a parity of value with this standard…”
But 33 years later, to gain the power to inflate the currency and collect the profit from doing so…
1933 – By executive order, Franklin Roosevelt prohibits the private ownership of gold.Congress passes the Gold Reserve Act, which enacts Roosevelt’s executive order, abrogates all gold clauses in all contracts public or private, past or future (which cancels the convertibility of Federal Reserve notes into gold), though it confirms the convertibility of US Treasury notes held by foreigners into gold. Eleven years later, the US government takes its show on the road…
1944 – Bretton Woods system adopted with signature countries agreeing to tie the exchange rates of their currencies to the US dollar, which itself is linked to a fixed price of gold. Foreign trading partners retained the right to swap dollars for gold, imposing a de facto restraint on printing more dollars. For all intents and purposes, the US dollar becomes the world’s reserve currency. But 27 years later…
1971 – Nixon abruptly closes the “gold window,” unilaterally reneging on the Treasury’s promise to allow foreign governments to redeem dollars for gold. Bretton Woods collapses. With no remaining tie to a tangible, the dollar is reduced to a paper token. The transition to a global fiat monetary system is complete.
Until 40 years go by and the inevitable consequences of giving politicians free rein over money creation become untenable…
Present day – Sovereign debt crisis. Desperate, debt-laden governments around the globe – the bulk of their reserves composed of fiat US dollars and euros at risk of going up in smoke – turn to the only thing they know, printing more money and issuing yet more debt. The global monetary system cracks and heads toward failure with no workable alternative on the horizon.
Governments, corporations and investors alike are caught unprepared in the downward spiral of failing fiat currencies and are wiped out by a combination of frantic currency debasements, higher taxation, exchange controls and worse. Social unrest spreads, with the public paradoxically demanding that governments do more, not less.
That’s because all the world’s major currencies are at risk, simultaneously, as the issuers engage in a dangerous race to the bottom. As the monetary system moves inexorably toward terminal debasement and collapse, the results will be catastrophic for the unprepared.
Importantly, while the list of historical attempts to re-jigger the US monetary system have, to this point, more or less succeeded in kicking the can a bit further down the road, the sheer scale of today’s government obligations has driven us into a box canyon, with no way out. As the government’s debt and spending obligations are mathematically impossible to resolve, it is now a certainty that a lot of people are going to wake up one morning to the reality that they are a lot poorer than they thought.
Fortunately for those now paying attention, the collapse of a monetary system doesn’t happen in a flash. It is a progression, like the spiral of water down a drain. Thus, while no one can predict exactly when the downward spiral will accelerate out of control, there is still time to prepare.
Dark though the lens may be, this is the lens through which we here at Casey Research view all our investments. Simply, being right or wrong about your investment decisions in the years just ahead will be insignificant if the currencies underpinning those investments shrivel to just a fraction of their current values.
The dismal state of the US economy and out-of-control government spending affects every American’s life and wealth. In the free online video event, The American Debt Crisis– How Big? How Bad? How to Protect Yourself, held on September 14, 2011, a Casey Research team of Doug Casey, Bud Conrad, Olivier Garret, Terry Coxon and David Galland will be joined by guests John Mauldin, Mike Maloney and Lew Rockwell to discuss the potential for a breakdown in the monetary system, and specific ways to protect and build your assets.

Wheat falls on profit booking


Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 10:17:46 +0000

Wheat yesterday traded with the negative node and settled -0.03% down at 1186 on slight profit booking but overall sentiment is positive as the government last week said it would allow exports of 2 million tonnes of the grain.
India will allow unrestricted exports of 2 million tonnes each of wheat and common rice, as bulging stocks offer political room for overseas sales. As per market sources, low prices of Indian origin wheat in international market might embrace the strong export demand.
Traders mentioned that Indian variety of wheat India are trading in the range of Rs. 11,800-INR11,900 per tonne delivered at major ports port, while FOB were at around $280/tonne, , which is lowest among the others in the international place. The Russian wheat is currently at around $290/tonne ( FOB) , while Australian Wheat is quoted at $310/tonne.
Therefore, strapping export demand of Indian wheat might keep the wheat futures supportive in the near term.
In Delhi wheat prices gained 2.25 rupee to end at 1162.25 rupees per 10 kg. In yesterday’s trading session Wheat has touched the low of 1182 after opening at 1185.2, and finally settled at 1186.

5 Less-Risky Ways to Buy Europe at a Discount


Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 10:17:00 +0000

BOSTON (TheStreet) — It seems no investor wants to touch Europe, the world’s riskiest investment region.
Old Europe may boast a model for democracy (Switzerland), innovation (Italy) and economic might (Germany), but the cradle of Western civilization (Greece) is bringing down the entire euro area and infecting the rest of the world. Still, anyone willing to take a chance on the continent can pick up plenty of European-themed exchange traded funds at deep discounts. Morningstar ETF analyst Timothy Strauts isn’t big on European investments these days, but says investors could generate outsized returns if — and “if” is the operative word — “European governments can actually come together and stem the tide on the Greek crisis.” The analyst’s reluctance to recommend European exchange traded funds stems from the fact that the Greek government’s potential imminent default on its debt has put the euro’s survival as Europe’s unified currency in doubt. “A breakup of the euro would have so many unintended consequences that any investment in Europe is highly risky right now, ” Strauts says. But if you’re brave at heart, Strauts notes that you can pick up these four European ETFs on the cheap. IShares MSCI Europe Financials Index ETF(EUFN): This fund focuses exclusively on European financial companies, “so it’s right in the center of the crisis — and its recent performance has obviously been terrible,” Strauts says. Launched just 17 months ago to mirror the MSCI Europe Financials Index, the ETF is off 36% since July 1. IShares S&P Europe 350 Index ETF(IEV): Strauts says this ETF is less risky than the Europe Financials Index fund because it’s diversified into more than just the banking sector. He added that British companies, which haven’t suffered as much as those in continental Europe because the United Kingdom doesn’t use the euro, make up the largest share of the Europe 350 Index fund’s assets. Still, French and German firms account for a quarter of the ETF’s holdings — a fact that has sent the fund tumbling. The ETF, which mirrors the large-cap S&P Europe 350 Index, has plunged 25% since July 1.






Retirement Strategies Take a Shine to Gold


Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 10:06:00 +0000

BOSTON (TheStreet) — Worries over domestic debt, fear of a double-dip recession and a desire to hedge against inflation are among the issue that have heated up gold fever and spiked the price of the precious metal to roughly $1,800 an ounce.
Should the mindset of gold bugs — despite some recent price declines — play into a retirement strategy, especially given the corrosive effect on savings inflation can have?





The “golden years” live up to their name as annuities and other products turn to the precious metal.


In recent months, some annuity providers have been starting to index their products to commodities. Among them is Investors Insurance, a subsidiary of SCOR Global Life. Its PremierMark SE fixed-index annuities include a product that links credited interest to performance increases in the price of gold during the term. By using the price of gold instead of the growth of an equity index to determine interest crediting, “this annual point-to-point strategy can turn a portion of your premium into a hedge against economic uncertainty,” marketing materials claim, describing it as “the fallback position when Wall Street turns bearish.” Billed as “among the first of its kind offered on a fixed-index annuity,” the strategy takes the closing price of gold on the last day of the term period and compares it with the price at the beginning of the term. The annuity contract is then credited with 100% of the gain in the price, up to a predetermined “cap” or maximum rate of interest. The interest credited is locked in annually, never less than 0%. A key selling point is that money is protected, with opportunities for long-term growth, says Jay Tyner, president of North Carolina-based Semmax Financial Group, who finds merit in the approach. “One of the things our clients have wanted to get away from was some of the risk and yet still have opportunities,” he says.

The overall downtrend continues to be intact, aiming at new historical lows below 75.95. Technical indicators are still descending and crucial resistance on the daily frame is 80.20.
Yesterday’s break above 77.10 resistance has neutralized the negative bias and currently the outlook is rather neutral. Important on the downside remains 76.40-50, as only a violation of that area will signal a renewal of the downtrend.

China ETFs Dispel Europe’s Economic Gloom


Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 10:00:00 +0000

NEW YORK (TheStreet) — The financial crisis sweeping through Europe is again dominating headlines and placing a heavy weight on investor shoulders as we progress into the week.
Although the turmoil in Greece, France, Germany and the rest of the euro monetary bloc will steal attention in the days ahead, I encourage investors to avoid being distracted from other events taking place elsewhere around the globe. While Europe is under a deluge of dismal market-related news, other closely watched global players have actually enjoyed some promising economic data over the past few days. China, for instance, started off the week on a relatively positive note. For weeks doubts have swirled around this Asian economic superpower as economists, analysts and investors have begun to question its ability to maintain a persistent level of breakneck economic growth. Fears of a hard landing have loomed heavily as nations around the world have witnessed a slowdown in economic growth. Despite these fears, there have been signs that China’s feared hard landing may not be in the cards. On the contrary, at the start of this week the nation released promising trade data, indicated that there is fuel left in its growth tank. According to the report, the nation’s imports saw a notable rise, while its overall trade surplus shrank considerably. The road ahead will likely not be entirely smooth for China. However, as evidenced by this data, it may not be as rocky as previously expected either. ETF investors with a tolerance for risk may want to place China-related funds on the radar. Already, the ETF investing public appears to be showing an interest in the nation. According to the data compiled by the National Stock Exchange, the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund(FXI) welcomed over $350 million in August. This not only earned the fund a spot among the top 25 inflow recipients overall; FXI also saw the heaviest inflows across the entire universe of international equity ETFs. FXI was not alone in its popularity. Other China-related ETFs like the SPDR S&P China ETF(GXC) enjoyed net inflows as well. This action flies in the face of the general attitude towards emerging markets in August.

USDJPY: Outlook Lower With Eyes On The 75.92 Level.
USDJPY – Our overall outlook remains bearish as USDJPY looks to decline further towards the 75.92 level, its 2011 low. A clean break below here will open the door for further weakness towards the 74.00 level and the 72.00 level, representing its psycho levels. Its monthly RSI is bearish and pointing lower suggesting further weakness. On the upside, unless its bottom forming scenario seen on the daily and weekly charts materializes, our downside outlook remains intact. The pair will have to break and close above the 80.19 level traded on Aug 04’2011 to put its broader long term weakness on hold and bring further gains towards its July’2011 high at 81.63. A violation of there will open up further upside risk towards the 85.51 level. All in all, we maintain a bearish bias on the pair in Sept with the risk being a break and hold below the 75.92 level.

Gold extends downtrend on Greece debt concerns


Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 09:17:46 +0000

Gold futures extended sharp losses on Monday and dropped by almost -1.29% to settled at 27793 though some support seen from rupee weakness in the morning session where rupee closed on yearly low at 47.2925 that dropped by almost -1.28%, as the safe haven appeal of the precious metal was reduced after IMF officials said Greece was likely to receive its next tranche of aid later this month.
Fears over an imminent Greek debt default eased after senior IMF officials said Greece would receive the next tranche of bailout loans later this month. The report came after Greece’s govt said that it will impose a new property tax to cover a EUR2 billion gap in its budget targets this year.
While the two IMF officials dismissed speculation of an impending Greek default or exit from the euro zone, they added that the next round of aid scheduled for Dec would be more difficult to arrange unless budget targets are met.
Meanwhile, gold traders were awaiting speeches from Fed Reserve Bank of Dallas President and St. Louis Fed Chief their comments will be closely watched for any clues regarding further easing measures.
Now technically market is trading in the range as RSI for 18days is currently indicating 57.91, where as 50DMA is at 25827.98 and gold is trading above the same and getting support at 27573 and below could see a test of 27354 level, And resistance is now likely to be seen at 28160, a move above could see prices testing 28528.

European Debt Woes Dominate, UK Inflation Hits 4.5%


Posted: Tue, 13 Sep 2011 09:17:38 +0000

























Forex News and Events:

Good news does not last long in this market. There was some temporary respite from all the doom and gloom this morning, as the Financial Times reported that China may be considering purchases of Italian debt – a story that provided some welcome relief to a market which has been bombarded by stories of sovereign credit woe and Greece’s seemingly interminable struggles with cash flow. The good mood however, has not persisted long beyond the start of the European trading day. Instead, European equity markets are once again sliding into negative territory and EURUSD has given up its gains rapidly in a tumble from 1.3695 to 1.3555 lows. The reality that has dawned onto investors over the past few weeks is that none of the short-term solutions or bailouts or assertions of investment interest from Asia are actually solving the fundamental problems that are fuelling the European debt crisis in the first place. Greece has been unable to meet the standards required of it in being a member of the Eurozone, and the Eurozone is ill-adapted to cater to a member unable to pull its own weight. For now, Greece’s policymakers appear committed to keeping the sinking ship afloat, but there may well come a point when the Greek people will weigh up the real cost of implementing austerity measures in order to maintain its Eurozone membership, and will decide it’s no longer worth it. Either that, or the increasingly disgruntled members of the core Eurozone states will wonder what exactly they are getting in return for all this bailout money, and whether they are merely ploughing more and more funds into a rescue, with little hoping of recovering their investment. There does not appear to be an easy solution to the Greece dilemma, and as such the stock market is likely to continue to suffer, and we expect EURUSD will test the 1.3000 levels in due course. This morning, UK CPI came out in line with expectations at 0.6% MoM, 4.5% YoY. Unsurprisingly, there was little reaction from the currency as inflation (even running at more than double the MPC’s 2% target) is really not swaying BoE opinion at this stage. Instead, the focus remains on growth risks and the heightened uncertainty surrounding Europe’s debt crisis. Later today, MPC member Adam Posen will be speaking in Gloucestershire, England, and we expect that any rhetoric emerging from his speech will resonate with his usual dovish message. Tomorrow will bring the UK’s latest claimant count and ILO unemployment rate; markets are looking for unemployment to remain stable at 7.9%, but the claimant count rate is expected to rise to 5.0% from last month’s 4.9%.

The Risk Today:


EurUsd EURUSD has managed to pare back some of its losses in the past few sessions, recovering from 1.3496 lows on Monday morning to just shy of 1.3700 today. Despite a couple of attempts however, the bulls have been unable to climb above 1.3695 – which leaves us vulnerable to another move lower today. With a plethora of historical supports broken on Friday, the next technical levels below are noted at 1.3496 (yesterday’s low in Asia), 1.3461 (15 Feb low), 1.3428 (14 Feb low) and 1.3244 (17 Jan low). On the topside first resistance is now 1.3695, then 1.3760-70 (upper edge of current short-term downtrend), 1.3840 (short-term peak seen Friday afternoon), and 1.3937 (9 Sep high).
GbpUsd GBPUSD has not made much more progress to the downside in the past 24 hours, instead oscillating within a range bounded by 1.5774 and 1.5886. There is still a 3-week downtrend channel in play however, so we’d expect that once this temporary pause is over, the sell-off will resume. We expect some support to appear around 1.5725-35 (lower edge of short-term downtrend channel) which is closely backed up by 1.5718 (13 Jan low); but below that zone we’d be on course for a return to 1.5513 (11 Jan low) and 1.5476 (10 Jan low). First resistance on the topside now stands at 1.5886 (yesterday’s high), with plenty of subsequent pockets of supply noted at 1.5991 (9 Sep high), 1.6005-15 (upper edge of current downtrend channel), 1.6083 (8 Sep high), and 1.6206 (6 Sep high).
UsdJpy USDJPY is still consolidating around 77.00 levels today, as the directionless lethargy that engulfed the market for most of August looks to have crept back into play. Next supports below are now eyed at 76.70 (6 Sep low), 76.40-50 (multi-low support from the last week of August), 75.96 (the all-time low set on 19 Aug), and finally the major psychological barrier 75.00. First resistance should now appear around 77.39 (yesterday’s afternoon high), followed by 77.86 (9 Aug high), 78.47 (8 Aug high), 79.42 (5 Aug high), 80.38 (12 Jul high), and 80.83 (11 Jul high).
UsdChf USDCHF has not managed to hit any fresh highs above 0.8929 (yesterday morning’s peak), but the pair does still look well bid above the 200-day moving average (now 0.8845) and may well re-test the highs today. Next resistance is seen at 0.8946 (13 May high), with further levels noted at 0.9012 (19 Apr high), and 0.9296 (6 Apr high). It still feels like there are a few short positions liquidating in this market so expect any dips to be met by good bids. First support is now that 200-day moving average 0.8845, followed by 0.8793 (today’s low), 0.8706 (9 Sep low), and 0.8540 (7 Sep low).

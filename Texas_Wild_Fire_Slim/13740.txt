Where else?

(Newser) -
                                    Insert appropriate Journey lyric here: Tareq Salahi  was convinced his wife had been kidnapped  today, but it turns out that Michaele is safe and sound ... in the arms of Journey guitarist Neal Schon, reports  TMZ .

Michaele Salahi Abducted, Says Tareq
And police aren't taking him seriously, he tells TMZ

(Newser) -
                                    Now this is bizarre: Tareq Salahi has reached out to  TMZ  because he thinks wife Michaele has been the victim of a publicity stunt, er, kidnapping. Salahi, who is of course famous for  crashing a White House dinner with his wife  and then moving on to a stint on Real ...

Guess Who's Allegedly Stripping for Playgirl? 
The wrong Salahi, one might argue

(Newser) -
                                    For those yearning from the depths of their aching souls to see Tareq Salahi naked—and we're quite sure there are none of you—brace yourselves.

Michaele Salahi Axed After 'Crashing'  Celeb Rehab 
She's not an addict, say program producers

(Newser) -
                                    Sorry, Michaele, your stunts won't wash with Dr. Drew. Notorious White House gate crasher Michaele Salahi has been bounced from a stint on Celebrity Rehab for not having an addiction.

Tim Gunn Calls Bluff on Michaele Salahi's MS
Salahis are 'sociopaths who believe own lies,' says fashion wonk

(Newser) -
                                    Poor White House gatecrasher Michaele Salahi recently revealed she has multiple sclerosis, which is why she had to duck out of the state dinner so quickly. One problem, though: The newly snarky Tim Gunn doesn't believe it. “I find it curious that the story is coming out now,"...

Salahis: We're Tired of Being the 'It' Couple
Life is so, so hard for Michaele and Tareq

(Newser) -
                                    You wouldn't know it from the way they  crashed a White House dinner  and  got themselves on a reality show , but apparently Michaele and Tareq Salahi really, really hate being so famous. They want to "return to who we were," Michaele tells HBO in a profile of their...

Salahis Served With Papers... at Their Own Party
Albeit not the sanctioned-by-Bravo party

(Newser) -
                                    Talk about a buzzkill: Michaele and Tareq Salahi were served with papers at their own party Thursday night. A PR firm claims the Salahis owe it more than $15,000 for its promotion of the couple's  sketchy 2008 “charity” polo event , and an employee says the process server handed...

White House Liaison Schmoozed With Salahis
'Housewives' premiere sure to be embarrassing

(Newser) -
                                    If the first episode of Real Housewives of DC is any indication, the series probably won’t be on the White House DVR queue. Embarrassments abound, starting with the connection shown between Michele Jones—who works for the secretary of defense and supposedly told the gatecrashing Salahis  she couldn’t...

Meet Salahi and her arguably less interesting DC costars

(Newser) -
                                    Looks like gatecrashing a White House state dinner can get you something other than jail: Namely, a reality show. Michaele Salahi is the most famous (infamous?) of the recently announced Real Housewives of DC lineup. Joining her are other “connected DC power players,” as Bravo calls them, including...

But it looked like they had their own dining plans

(Newser) -
                                    It only sounds like deja vu all over again: Party crashers Michaele and Tareq Salahi were stopped in a limo near the White House last night, but it doesn't look like they were trying to bust their way into their second state dinner. Their driver ran a red light a...

                                    Alleged White House gate-crashers Tareq and Michaele Salahi said little to a House panel today, repeatedly invoking their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.

Sketchy guy hooked up with Indian posse after trip to men's room

(Newser) -
                                    What lapse allowed Carlos Allen, the third party crasher, to sneak into the Obamas' first state dinner remains a mystery. What is known is that Allen—who has done everything from designing clothes to selling mortgages to running a questionable charity that existed mainly to throw parties—dressed even more...

(AP) -
                                    It wasn't a state dinner, and they didn't crash it on purpose. Still, a Georgia couple who showed up at the White House a day early for a tour somehow wound up at an invitation-only breakfast with President Obama. The White House and Secret Service said Harvey and Paula Darden...

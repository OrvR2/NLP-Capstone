Top of Chinese wealthy's wish list? To leave ChinaBy LOUISE WATT - Associated Press | AP – 20 hrs ago

BEIJING (AP) — Chinese millionaire Su builds skyscrapers in Beijing and is one of the people powering China's economy on its path to becoming the world's biggest.He sits at the top of a country — economy booming, influence spreading, military swelling — widely expected to dominate the 21st century.Yet the property developer shares something surprising with many newly rich in China: he's looking forward to the day he can leave.Su's reasons: He wants to protect his assets, he has to watch what he says in China and wants a second child, something against the law for many Chinese.The millionaire spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only his surname was used because of fears of government reprisals that could damage his business.China's richest are increasingly investing abroad to get a foreign passport, to make international business and travel easier but also to give them a way out of China.The United States is the most popular destination for Chinese emigrants, with rich Chinese praising its education and healthcare systems. Last year, nearly 68,000 Chinese-born people became legal permanent residents of the U.S., seven percent of the total and second only to those born in Mexico. Canada and Australia are also popular.It is a bothersome trend for China's communist leaders who've pinned the legitimacy of one-party rule on delivering rapid economic growth and a rising standard of living. They've succeeded in lifting tens of millions of ordinary Chinese out of poverty while also creating a new class of super rich. Yet affluence alone seems a poor bargain to those with the means to live elsewhere.Despite more economic freedom, the communist government has kept its tight grip on many other aspects of daily life. China's leaders punish, sometimes harshly, public dissent and any perceived challenges to their power, and censor what can be read online and in print. Authoritarian rule, meanwhile, has proved ineffective in addressing long standing problems of pollution, contaminated food and a creaking health care system."In China, nothing belongs to you. Like buying a house. You buy it but it will belong to the country 70 years later," said Su, lamenting the government's land leasing system."But abroad, if you buy a house, it belongs to you forever," he said. "Both businessmen and government officials are like this. They worry about the security of their assets."Leo Liu, marketing manager at Beijing emigration consultants Goldlink, said the company has noticed an increasing trend of rich Chinese wanting to emigrate, particularly to Canada, in the 15 years since it was founded.The main reasons people want to move abroad, he said, are their children's education and for better healthcare. Some want to leave because they got their money illegally, such as corrupt government officials and businesspeople, while others are inspired by friends who have already emigrated to the U.S."They want to get a green card even though they may still do business here in China," Liu said. "They might have sent their wife and children abroad."And some of them just love life in a foreign country, the Western style," he said.There is also a yawning gap between rich and poor in China, which feeds a resentment that makes some of the wealthy uncomfortable. The country's uneven jump to capitalism over the last three decades has created dozens of billionaires, but China barely ranks in the top 100 on a World Bank list of countries by income per person.Getting a foreign passport is like "taking out an insurance policy," said Rupert Hoogewerf, who compiles the Hurun Rich List, China's version of the Forbes list."If there is political unrest or suddenly things change in China — because it's a big country, something could go wrong — they already have a passport to go overseas. It's an additional safety net."Among the 20,000 Chinese with at least 100 million yuan ($15 million) in individual investment assets, 27 percent have already emigrated and 47 percent are considering it, according to a report by China Merchants Bank and U.S. consultants Bain & Co. published in April.Nearly 60 percent of the people surveyed said worries over their children's education are a reason for wanting to leave.A millionaire who works in the coal industry, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the main push behind his plans to emigrate is China's test-centric school system, often criticized for producing students who can pass exams but who lack skills for the world of work.He will take his 7-year-old to the U.S. as soon as the child graduates from junior high at an international school in Beijing where pupils are instructed in English."The U.S. has a good educational system and excellent health care," said the 39-year-old, who has three homes in China and assets worth $5 million. "That's why we look forward to going there."Other top motivations cited in the Merchants Bank study are to protect assets and to prepare for retirement. Also cited as reasons for leaving: having more children and making it easier to develop an overseas business.Alongside increased emigration there has also been a massive outflow of private money from China despite its strict currency controls. The report estimates that rich Chinese — those with assets of more than 10 million yuan — have about 3.6 trillion yuan ($564 billion) invested overseas."The Chinese economy now looks like a massive funnel," said Zhong Dajun, director of the non-governmental Dajun Center for Economic Observation & Studies in Beijing.Zhong said it is mostly corrupt government officials who transfer entire fortunes overseas because they have been illegally acquired and "they have fears and feel guilty."Wealthy Russians have also been establishing footholds abroad for the past decade, seeking a safe haven both for their money and their children. In recent years, the trend has extended to Russia's emerging middle class. They cannot afford to invest in London, a favorite destination for Russia's billionaires and millionaires, so have been setting up second homes in less expensive European countries, including those like the Czech Republic that were once part of the Soviet bloc.Su, the property developer, intends to stay in China and continue building residential high-rises and office buildings for another 10 years because he fears it would be too difficult for him to replicate his mainland business success abroad.His wife is already in the U.S., expecting their second child. Under China's one-child policy in place for the last three decades to control population growth, couples can be penalized for having more than one child. In Beijing, the penalty is a one-off fee 3-10 times the city's average income, a maximum of 250,000 yuan ($40,000)."The living conditions abroad are better, like residential conditions, food safety and education," said the millionaire as he dined in the VIP room of a Beijing restaurant. Lowering his voice, he said for many rich there are worries about the authoritarian government. "This is a very sensitive topic. Everyone knows this. It's freer and more just abroad," he said.

In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.

I understand them wanting to leave their country if not happy there. but united states is no longer as free as they think... our schools are run based on tests also...the curriculum is based on yearly tests, spelling and reading classes no longer taught.  school systems are more worried about government money and dress codes than if our children know how to spell or read.  As for housing sure you can buy your house and it will be yours unless you happen to buy on property that the government needs later and then they just condemn it or harass you until you give the price they had decided to buy it for.  And if you live inside a city then the government can tell you how to keep your yard and house, everything has to have a perfect appearance no couch on the front porch here. So no matter where you live there are always going to be problems and not all cities or states are as controlling as others.

Oh, yeah, the Chinese government is rich in the city, but not other people in China still worse. U.S. government can be seen only in the city and no other problems nationaliy in China. The Chinese government hides many of its secrets. View in this country, like the people make being live. yeah, the Chinese government save a lot of money because they do not want to spend their money to build their country and to do, let some other nationality is bad, you might think that the Chinese government is needing time to build up false. One of the Chinese government is not the development that does not deter Chinese nationaliy not to let them develop it in power, so they do not intend to land

I'm "wowed" but it makes sense!! Coming to the USA or Canada is a "step-up" out of China. But by 2016 China is said to be the "world's top economy". The Bible tells us they will be a "world power" in the 7 year tribution period. USA power is declining and will continue . The EU will re-build so dont pay attention to what you see right now. The shaking of financial markets,  the weather, the Heavens!! Birth Pains Era is on!!!!  ~ Rev.Sean

That's funny, the Obama and his chosen Maoist czars, are seeking State Capitalism here in America.  Many Democrats are clamoring for Socialist/Marxist/Islamofascist Hybrid State to supplant American Capitalism with. 

The Chinese wealthy wanting to leave China's oppression and liberty bondage, need to heed a quote from Obama's selected Marxist czar Van Jone's book; Strike the establishment pose to achieve the radical end goals. 

The progressive left (liberal; pose change) today in America have played the covert words of Obama and His obamanite hordes in perfect harmony as outlined in Saul Alinsky hatred of the American system as established by Her founding fathers.  This cancerous malignancy today has spread throughout the entire body of American society; education, economy, government, even to the presidency.  

The "change" Obama covertly (pose) ran on, but never outlined or held responsible too; transparency on cspan, lol), is about complete, and the only thing left in the way is American Patriots.  Obama's comrade, and community organizer colleague, the progressive leftist highly venerated Marxist anarchist to destroy America weather underground leader Bill Ayers organization said in the 1960's 25,000,000 Americans would need to die to achieve this end goal.  This makes for an interesting scenario, when we consider the American union leaders, controlled by Obama, are working with the Communist and Muslim "democracy" movements around the world, connecting through Obama's goggle VP Muslim friend to destabilize the middle east. What really stirs the curiosity, the Muslim Brotherhood at the point of all the progressive movements, even accommodating Marxism and Islamofascists, "social justice,"; pose, to unite, listed in their book 25,000,000 Americans need to die in order to make America Shirah compliant.   

When I consider these things at work in America and around the world today, I truly believe, even though I do side with one of Obama's Union Leader's recent comments to kill the Tea Party, I can appreciate his frankness in drawing the line where by members on both sides may prepare themselves for the bloody 2012.        

My advice to the Chinese wealthy, ride it out a little longer... State Capitalism will come to you. 

Even so, come Lord Jesus.  amen

p.s. Bill Ayers words today:  I do not apologize for my actions with the weather underground, my only regret is I didn't do more...

In response to "test centric schooling". Unfortunately that is exactly what is starting to happen(slow ride since the late 90s) with the American educational system.  We need less memorization, and more hands on education.  Tests are not and should not be the final word on a childs knowledge.  Heck there are many children that do poorly on test but have retained the knowledge and are able to apply it just fine.

My best friend ,she just has announced her wedding with a millionaire man! They met via SearchⱤichṢingles.CȯṀ ..it is the largest and best club for millionaires and their admirers to chat online. …You do not have to be rich or famous, but you may meet one. It's worth a try!

Of course these stories weren't meant to appease children. Disney "softened" most of the stories that were actually meant to frighten. Look at faeries. I'd estimate that 85% of the population believes that faeries are tiny, magical, harmless creatures that flutter and help children. When in reality, folklore says that they were mischievous, not always tiny, often harmful, and that they abducted people. But tell that to someone and they're ready to say: "But I thought faeries were nice."

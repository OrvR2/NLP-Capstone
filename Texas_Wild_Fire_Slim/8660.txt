Summary Box: Gold falls on German bailout rulingBy The Associated Press | AP – 15 hrs ago





GOLD DIMS: Gold fell 3 percent as a German court supported that country's efforts to help its financially troubled neighbors. That increased optimism about the European economy led investors to sell gold and move money into other assets.COTTON BUMP: Cotton prices jumped as crop conditions deteriorated last week. Demand also appeared to be picking up.OIL MOVE: Oil prices increased on speculation that Gulf of Mexico production could be affected by tropical storms. Tropical Storm Lee forced 131 oil platforms in the Gulf to evacuate, cutting production by 847,000 barrels per day.

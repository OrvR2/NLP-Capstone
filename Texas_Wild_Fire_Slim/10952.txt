Missoni for Target collection hits eBay, Craigslist













Jessica Dickler, 	On Wednesday September 14, 2011, 2:45 pm EDT

Just one day after the launch of the Missoni for Target collection brought the retailer's web site to its knees, a secondary market for the items -- many of which sold out in a matter of hours -- has already sprung up on eBay and Craigslist.But shoppers eager to nab items from the limited edition of home goods, apparel and accessories better be prepared to pay a premium: The same Missoni for Target offerings on these sites are being sold for up to five times the original retail price.  A Missoni for Target throw in a classic colorful zigzag pattern that retailed for $39.99 is now being offered on eBay for close to $200 and one of the most hyped offerings, a three-speed bike (also with the trademark Missoni pattern), is being sold for $1,500 on Craigslist -- four times more than the original retail price.  Missoni for Target items that are fetching big bucks on eBay, CraigslistLauren Riley was one of the lucky few who were able to get online before Target's site crashed on Tuesday. "I just started buying," she said.Although Riley originally intended to keep a few things for herself and give other items to her friends, she says she quickly changed her mind after she saw the potential to profit. Among other items, Riley is selling a Missoni for Target travel tote for $165 on Craigslist -- the original retail price: $34.99."Once I saw the high upsale I said, you know what I don't need it that badly," she said.Although the markups are substantial, the prices are still significantly lower than Missoni's usual price point. A $39.99 Missoni for Target sleeveless sweater dress is available for $150 to $300 on the black market, but such offerings from the Italian designer would normally cost well over $1,000 at stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus (although those sweater dresses would be wool rather than polyester).  This latest collaboration is one in a long line of capsule collections Target has done since the inception of the GO International program in 2006, aimed to highlight high-end designers with mainstream appeal, all of which have been extremely popular."There's something about these collaborations that is infectious," noted Alexandra Greenawalt, a New York-based fashion stylist.Previous collaborations with designers including Zac Posen, Rodarte and Thakoon have also resulted in lucrative second-market sales, but not to this extent, Greenawalt said.Joshua Carter, a spokesman for Target, said some additional supply will trickle in to stores and online although supplies will vary by location."Target is aware of online auction sites carrying the Missoni for Target collection -- this is similar to past designer collections. We encourage guests to shop the collection at Target and Target.com to ensure they are getting the best deal and authentic product," he said.The Missoni for Target collection will continue to be available through Oct. 22, pending availability.View this article on CNNMoney

If you didn't need it that badly, then you shouldn't have bought it and saved it for someone who actually wanted it and gotten it legit like you did.   Selfish morally bankrupt these people are.   SAD!

1 users disliked this comment Jessica 5 minutes ago Report Abuse I buy almost everything except food and clothing from online auctions.Most people aren't aware of the almost unbelievable deals that they can get from online auction sites.

The site that has the best deals is savedmore c☼m	

and I checked with the Better Business Bureau and was told that it is all legit.

How they can sell gift cards, laptops, cameras, and all kinds of goodies that we all want for 50-90% off, I don't know. I do know that I bought my son an iPad there for less than $100 and my husband a $250 Loews gift cards for $48.

Why would I even think about shopping anyplace else?

This nation is already one of excess, gluttony, greed and covetousness. Stupidity such as this only reinforces our reputation as ignorant pigs among the other people of the world.

After 20 Years, Missing CEO Reappears

ComputerLand Corp. founder William Millard is shown in 1986.
For more than 20 years, tech tycoon William H. Millard was one of the world's   most elusive tax exiles, leaving financial footprints in Singapore, Ireland and   other locales while racking up an unpaid tax bill of more than $100   million.The 79-year-old founder of the ComputerLand Corp. retail chain was last seen   by tax authorities on the remote Pacific Island of Saipan, where he lived, in   August 1990. A few years after selling his company, the man once listed as one   of the richest people in America suddenly vanished.Until now. The U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, of which   Saipan is a part, has tracked Mr. Millard and his wife to a yellow mansion on   Grand Cayman Island in the western Caribbean, according to court filings and   attorneys working on the case.With help from a New York law firm and a small army of private investigators,   the commonwealth now is digging into what its lawyers say is a network of more   than 50 shell companies, trusts and bank accounts linked to Mr. Millard in hopes   of collecting the $100 million."This is one of the most sophisticated and complicated cases of offshore   asset structuring that we have ever seen," said Michael Kim, a partner of Kobre   & Kim, the law firm leading the case. "He's had more than 20 years to move   money all over the world."The discovery of Mr. Millard resurrects one of the most storied and   controversial names in technology, even as it moves the cat-and-mouse game   between Mr. Millard and the Marianas into a new phase of financial accounts and   bank subpoenas.[More from WSJ.com: How to Turn In Your Neighbor to the IRS]The breakthrough came last Christmas, when a private investigator spotted Mr.   Millard at a holiday dinner with one of his daughters in Florida, according to   Northern Mariana Islands government officials.Reached by phone in Grand Cayman, Mr. Millard declined to comment, saying,   "We are private people and have always been very private."An attorney for Mr. Millard's two daughters declined to comment.Terry Giles, a longtime former lawyer for Mr. Millard, said his ex-client   wasn't made aware he owed a tax bill until just a few days ago, and dismissed as   "ludicrous and insulting" the idea that Mr. Millard was hiding. Asked where Mr.   Millard was from 1990 until now, Mr. Giles said, "I'm not going to do a single   thing that would be helpful to" his pursuers.Mr. Millard made headlines in the 1970s and 1980s as one of California's   visionary tech pioneers. The charismatic college dropout built ComputerLand into   the largest computer retailing chain in the 1970s and 1980s, with some 800   stores, and Mr. Millard's stake was valued by investment bankers at one point at   $1 billion or more.He wasn't your typical entrepreneur. A devotee of est, a faddish   self-empowerment regimen of that era, he had a fondness for aphorisms ("We're a   family, not a company") and a contempt for convention. With his piercing green   eyes, Mr. Millard saw himself more as a kind of philosopher king than a   businessman, according to two people who worked for ComputerLand.He and his wife, Patricia, built a Tudor mansion outside Oakland nicknamed   "The St. James" and filled it with antiques, paintings and sculptures. He had a   fleet of private jets at his disposal, including a Falcon 50 and a Learjet. He   would work 14- and 18-hour days, fueled by peanut-butter sandwiches.Mr. Millard's unorthodox management style and lavish spending, which included   a million-dollar company-sponsored plan to fight world hunger, eventually led to   his departure from ComputerLand. After losing a court battle over an early loan   to the business, as well as a fight with franchisees and management, Mr. Millard   relinquished control in 1986.Shortly after, he and his family moved to Saipan. He told the news media he   chose the island near Guam because it was in Asia, which he predicted would be   the next growth region."You know the saying 'Go west, young man'?" he told The Wall Street Journal   in 1986. "Well, this is about as far west as I could go and still be under the   American flag."[More from WSJ.com: Celebrities Struggle to Crack Caption Contest]Saipan's hospitable tax climate may also have played at role. The   commonwealth had authority to reduce the tax rate imposed by U.S. law on income   sourced in the Northern Marianas, and it did so. Residents in effect got a 95%   rebate of the taxes they would normally have owed under U.S. law.Mr. Millard appeared to be a tax-conscious man. At ComputerLand, he had   helped create a complex tax structure using a trust in the Isle of Jersey and a   holding company in Panama designed to reduce his income taxes. A former staff   member of his company says Mr. Millard kept a copy of the Internal Revenue   Service Code on his desk.In Saipan, he started building a turreted castle on a cliff overlooking the   ocean, with a pool and homes for his daughters. Protecting the homes was a   30-foot-high enclosure that locals called "the Great Wall of China."He also launched a utility company aimed at taking over and improving the   island's creaky power grid, and hatched plans for real-estate developments.Mr. Millard made himself unpopular with some on the island. In a speech to   business leaders, he complained that certain officials were always asking him   for bribes.Though the government over the years has often faced corruption allegations,   his remarks angered some Saipan residents, and a government official says Mr.   Millard received death threats.Mr. Millard made plans in 1986 to sell his remaining stake in ComputerLand.   The sale, for an undisclosed price that commonwealth authorities estimated at   $200 million to $250 million, wasn't completed until the middle of 1987.By that time, the commonwealth had changed the generous tax regime under   which Mr. Millard sought to pay his taxes. Instead of reducing residents' taxes   on locally earned income by 95%, the new law reduced it by only 50% for amounts   over $7.5 million and 25% for income over $20 million. Moreover, the   commonwealth said he didn't qualify even for those breaks, since ComputerLand   was built in the U.S. and thus was subject to U.S. tax rates.In August 1990, the Millards left Saipan.The following year, the Northern Marianas' tax department issued a deficiency   notice to the Millards and their attorneys in the U.S., according a commonwealth   filing in federal courts in the U.S.Mr. Giles, the former lawyer for Mr. Millard, said he never received such a   notice.[More from WSJ.com: Job Seekers Face Childhood Misdeeds]"Bill paid his taxes in the Marianas on time and in full based on the tax   code. They changed the law or made up some reason retroactively to try to chase   Bill off the island," Mr. Giles said.In 1994, the commonwealth obtained a tax judgment against Mr. Millard and his   wife for $36 million in U.S. District Court in the Northern Marianas.Over the years, commonwealth officials picked up traces of Mr. Millard's   movements in Singapore, Ireland, Brussels, Hong Kong and the Caymans, but "we   did not have any verifiable information" on his whereabouts, said Benigno   Fitial, governor of the Northern Mariana Islands. At some point, according to   Mr. Giles, Mr. Millard became an Irish citizen, later giving up his U.S.   passport.A few years ago, Mr. Fitial says, he pushed to start a search for the family.   "The actions by the Millards in these proceedings seemed to reflect an attitude   of arrogance that their wealth allows them to disregard the laws of small   government," the governor said.The commonwealth in 2010 hired Kobre & Kim, a New York law firm that   specializes in international collections. With its team of tax attorneys,   forensic accountants and private investigators, the firm spent months searching   for Mr. Millard and his assets, as interest and penalties on his tax bill sent   it past $100 million.Late last December, a private investigator working for the law firm staked   out the home of Mr. Millard's daughter Barbara, a former ComputerLand president,   near Orlando, Fla. Late in the afternoon on Christmas Eve, the investigator   spotted Mr. Millard taking a walk in the yard, according to lawyers working on   the case.They say they kept a close eye on the house and, a few days later, followed   Mr. Millard to the airport, where he boarded a flight for Grand Cayman. Another   private investigator was waiting in the Caymans when Mr. Millard landed, and   secretly followed him to his house.Finding his money has proved more difficult. The tax judgment was registered   in federal courts in Florida and New York in March, and Kobre & Kim started   issuing subpoenas to dozens of banks and other institutions with accounts the   lawyers believed were linked to Mr. Millard.The investigation has been covert, the law firm never confronting Mr.   Millard.Investigators worried that if he found out what they knew, he might quickly   shift his funds around to get them out of reach. The subpoenas went out under a   gag order to prevent financial institutions from disclosing the probe to Mr.   Millard or his family.On Aug. 3, however, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. sent a copy of a subpoena and   gag order to one of Mr. Millard's daughters, according to lawyers and to   documents filed in federal court in New York and Florida.It was a "clerical error," said a letter from J.P. Morgan to the law firm,   now also filed in court. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.After the disclosure, phone numbers and websites for some institutions the   lawyers had linked to Mr. Millard were removed or shut down, according to Kobre   & Kim attorneys.Still, they say, they have started closing in on dozens of trusts and   accounts they believe contain pieces of Mr. Millard's fortune. Situated in   Ireland, the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, Singapore and other countries, the   entities have names like Bamba Ltd., Maximum Enterprises and The Diamond   Trust.The attorneys say Mr. Millard's strategy appears to have been to sprinkle his   wealth among as many different far-flung accounts as possible and allow the   money to trickle back in small amounts."I hope he will do the right thing and pay his debts," said Mr. Kim, the   law-firm partner. "But most people do not let go of $100 million easily."The Millard's half-built castle in Saipan sits abandoned. The Northern   Mariana government says it plans to foreclose on the property."It is out of place on a Micronesian island," said Mr. Fitial, the governor.   "Which is probably reflective of his entire stay here."

Can you still prosecute if he is no longer a citizen or for that fact collect anything from him? It's strange though, I didn't even know I owed taxes in the state I live in and they froze my bank account and took two disability checks from me. They would have got more if I hadn't of stopped my direct deposit and I lost my place to live!

My neighbor owed 3000 bucks and he only makes $12 an hour. The IRS hunted him like a mass murderer and were gonna take away his house. Now millionaires and billionaires can owe many millions and the IRS ignores it and lets them get away with it.

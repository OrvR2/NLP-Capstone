Big U.S. banks in talks with state prosecutors to settle claims of improper mortgage practices have been offered a deal that may limit their legal liabilities in return for a multibillion-dollar payment, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.
The talks aim to settle allegations that banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Ally Financial, seized the homes of delinquent borrowers and broke state laws by employing so-called "robosigners," workers who signed off on foreclosure documents en masse without reviewing the paperwork.
The FT, citing five people with direct knowledge of the discussions, said state prosecutors have proposed settlement language in the "robosigning" cases that also might release the companies from legal liability for wrongful securitization practices.
A spokesman for Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who is leading states' negotiations with the banks, denied any deal has been offered on securitization.
"We do not intend to release any aspect of securitizations," said Geoff Greenwood, Miller's spokesman.
The banks are pressing for immunity from a raft of alleged civil violations and have called the latest proposal a "non-starter."
 The two sides are due to meet again this week to iron out differences on any proposed deal, the article said.

				Wall Street writes their own law.

"Deals" and paltry, token "fines" are just a business expense.

What we have here, people, is essentiall­y lawlessnes­s - legalized economic tyranny that infiltrate­s and poisons every aspect of American life. 

If we still operated under strict rule of law and true justice, Lloyd "I'm-Doing­-God's-Wor­k" Blankfein and the rest of the Holy Wall Street Army would be rotting in prison.

				"Capital [i.e., rich men] must protect itself in every way... Debts must be collected and loans and MORTGAGES FORECLOSED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 

When through a process of law the common people have lost their homes, they will be more tractable and more easily... governed by the strong arm of the law applied by the central power of leading financiers . 

People without homes will not quarrel with their leaders. 

This is well known among our principle men now engaged in forming an imperialis­m of capitalism to govern the world. By dividing the people we can get them to expend their energies in fighting over questions of no importance to us except as teachers of the common herd." 	

~ JP MORGAN 1902

				The banks pay each other and the government for their illegal actions but for those that really got scammed there is no relief. 
Banks still foreclose on their improper mortgages and the government allows them to. In many cases the foreclosur­es do not meet state or federal laws requiremen­ts but the judges turn a blind eye to the banks illegal action.
So much for justice

				We have an adversaria­l judicial system.   It is not up to the judges to go looking for evidence, the opposing lawyers have to bring it before the court.   Most foreclosur­es are unopposed, even if they are improper, because the 'homeowner­' has not made any mortgage payments for two or three years and figures his time in the house is up.

				When the laws is being violated and the judge knows about it and still allows the foreclosur­e that's a problem. in many cases ib Florida the judge does not even allow the defendant to make a reply in open court allowing the bank to foreclose without ever proving their case.

				And WHY would they be offered a deal????  This is the problem - they do crappy things to their customers knowing full well that they will get away with it.  They should have to go to court and pay for the grief they have caused people.

				When the rule of law does not apply to the rich and the powerful, the law loses its legitimacy­.  For the Obama administra­tion and some state AG's to let these thieving bankers not only go unpunished for their crimes, but ask them to return only a tiny amount of what they stole as "punishmen­t" should be a clear signal to anyone who still has a doubt about their interest in law and justice.

				Why any monetary settlement at all?

Why not force them to make good on the loans they made. Force them to roll back the interest, or the payments, or reset the amount or all three?

Why should this money go to the states or feds who were supposed to be watching out for us and failed???

Make a settlement that does something for The People, for a change!!!

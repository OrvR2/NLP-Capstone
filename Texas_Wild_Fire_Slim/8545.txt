Obama to propose $300 billion jobs package: reportsBy Alister Bull, Laura MacInnis, Matt Spetalnick, Joanne Allen, David Morgan, and Jeff Mason | Reuters – 16 hrs ago

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, facing waning confidence among Americans in his economic stewardship, plans some $300 billion in tax cuts and government spending as part of a job-creating package, U.S. media reported on Tuesday.
The price tag of the proposed package, to be announced by Obama in a nationally televised speech to Congress on Thursday, would be offset by other cuts that the president would outline, CNN reported, citing Democratic sources.
Bloomberg News said the plan would inject more than $300 billion into the economy next year through tax cuts, spending on infrastructure, and aid to state and local governments.
Obama would offset those short-term costs by calling on Congress to raise tax revenues in a deficit-cutting proposal he will lay out next week, the news agency reported, without citing sources.
The White House declined to comment on the reports.
Obama's aides have refused to go public with the estimated cost of Obama's package or provide many specifics in advance, except to say that the proposals will have a "quick and positive" impact on boosting jobs at a time of stubbornly high U.S. unemployment.
"We need to do things that will have a direct impact in the short-term to grow the economy and create jobs, and the president will put forward proposals that will do just that," White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
Republicans criticized Obama for not including them in discussions on the package before his big speech and indicated any jobs bills could face tough passage through Congress, where they control the House of Representatives.
"I have no doubt the president will propose many things on Thursday that, when looked at individually, sound pretty good, or that he'll call them all bipartisan. I'm equally certain that, taken as whole, they'll represent more of the same failed approach," said the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell.
Republican House leaders separately wrote to Obama urging him to repeal "excessive, job-destroying regulations" and laying out possible areas of common ground, including reforms to the unemployment system and free-trade agreements.
WANING CONFIDENCE, TAX CUTS
Confidence in Obama's management of the economy has been hit by months of bad economic news, and several polls on Tuesday showed fresh declines in his job approval ratings.
Obama hopes to start reversing this trend with his address to a joint session of Congress on Thursday, in which he will try to convince voters that he has a better economic recovery plan than his Republican opponents.
Bloomberg News said nearly half the stimulus in Obama's plan would come from tax cuts, including an extension of a payroll tax cut paid by workers and a new decrease in the amount paid by employers. Vice President Joe Biden told reporters last month a payroll tax cut for employers was being considered.
Direct aid to local governments will focus on stopping layoffs of teachers and first responders, Bloomberg said.
Obama fought Republicans for much of the summer to lift the U.S. debt ceiling in a bitter debate that saw rating agency Standard & Poor's cut the U.S. AAA credit rating, and he must now get lawmakers to back additional spending that many oppose.
However, the president is seeking congressional support at a time when his own prospects of re-election have worsened.
An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed Obama's job approval rating at a low of 44 percent, while an ABC News/ Washington Post poll found that six in 10 Americans now rate the president's job on the economy and jobs negatively.
A third survey by Politico and George Washington University found that 72 percent of voters believe the country is either strongly or somewhat headed in the wrong direction, a jump of 12 percent since last May.
Obama must get unemployment down from levels currently above 9 percent to improve his chances of winning a second White House term in the November 2012 election.
The president has already touched on a various steps Congress could take to lift growth and hiring, including infrastructure spending, business tax breaks, and extending the payroll tax cut and aid for the long-term unemployed.

Union Members are not Americans, they are SOCIALISTS without hope. Unions are dying in America because Unions help the lousy worker and screw the hard working individual every time. Employers do not need a group of thugs holding them hostage because Jamal the Janitor doees like the money he is getting paid. The Unions will go on strike to make sure Jamal makes the same money that a JOURNEYMAN MACHINIST MAKES, even though Jamal, like President Obama, can't even tie his own shoes. That is why Unions are dying, employers do not want their throats cut for Jamal.
America now realizes that WE HAVE A JAMAL IN THE WHITE HOUSE who cannot tie his shoes.
It is time to take America back and that is for sure, after we do that we need to destroy the AFL/CIO, UAW, SEIU. Then both the Government and business can breath without the THREAT FROM WITHIN.

don't like it?then the private sector should be hiring instead of replacing jobs with robots and sending jobs overseas.big business is laying us off and throwing us and our children from our homes and into the street, in the name of increased profits
   big corporations are responsible for increased social spending,when you lay people off,what do you expect them to do?simply disappear?.

NEW YORK IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE IN TROUBLE. AMERICA IS: Read below:

Some people have the vocabulary to sum up things in a way you can understand them. This quote came from the Czech Republic . 
Someone over there has it figured out. We have a lot of work to do.
 =======================================================================
 "The danger to America is not Barack Obama, but a citizenry capable of entrusting an inexperienced man like him with the Presidency. 
It will be far easier to limit and undo the follies of an Obama presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a man for their president. 
The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails America .
 Blaming the prince of the fools should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools that made him their prince.
 The Republic can survive a Barack Obama.
 It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools, such as those who made him their president."

GOD BLESS AMERICA ,  OUR TROOPS AND THE STATE OF ISRAEL

It is a mess, no doubt.  I  cannot  seem to forget, however, the  Republican Berlin wall that stops everything Obama proposes. neither do I forget the billions the big banks on Wall Street failed to lend when told that that was what the money was for. The republicans as a whole, to me, are as cattle, blindlessly obeying some senseless, rogue bull.  there is no easy fix, but, by god, it would be easier if we all pulled together and stopped our republican naysayers and asked them to get busy for the country, not their self-righteous ignorance.

Hmmm...
It's almost funny to watch so much hate and blame directed at the president. 

If someone who didn't understand how our government works were to read this filth they'd think that the president were a king who could make his policies reality instead of one man fighting against a committed group of bought and paid for traitors who are doing everything in their power to make sure that he and this country fails.

Has anyone ever heard of a filibuster???

Frustrated Americans sent all you Republicans extremists teabaggers to congress to create jobs and reduce the deficit but instead you gave one (1) trillion in tax break to the richest and you immediately oppose oppose unemployment benefits and other social programs for the economically challenged and now 300 billion for jobs creation?.....that is tantamount to betrayal of your constituents and is treanson.

Be more government jobs and construction jobs.  He said that the other night.  Going to try one more time to help his Illinois buddies at Cat.  Construction doesn't drive an economy.  It gets driven by a strong economy.  You have to mine it, milk it or make it.  Then the other stuff follows.

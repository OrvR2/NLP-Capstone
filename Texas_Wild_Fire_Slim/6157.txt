At the Republican debate Wednesday night, the fireworks came quickly between Gov. Rick Perry and the man he replaced as the frontrunner for the Republican party's presidential nominee: Mitt Romney.
The topic of contention was, as it has been for several days now, job creation. Romney argued that a career politician wasn't the right resume to have to turn the country around, and Perry responded by noting that Romney, while in the private equity world, did a good job creating jobs... overseas.
Then it turned a more personal.
"States are different," Romney said, of the notion that Perry's management of Texas showed his prowess as a job creator. "Texas is a great state. Texas has zero income tax, [it's] a right to work state, [with] a republican legislature ... a lot of oil and gas in the ground ... Those are wonderful things. Governor Perry didn't create those things. If he tried to say that it would be like Al Gore saying he invented the Internet."
Perry, famously, worked on Al Gore's 1988 presidential campaign.
"Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did Mitt," Perry responded.
"George Bush and his predecessor created jobs at a faster rate than you did," Romney replied.
"That's not correct," Perry said.

				As a Texan you need to know a bit of our strangness­...

First, us Texans know how everything s/b in the U.S. and in the entire world, but have never been anywhere else!

Secondly when some one Cons us, we admire them, take notes so we can then screw some one else and do it bigger and better. We know how to learn/prof­it from our mistakes!

Now I only have lived in Texas for the past 20 years and this was told to me by texans when I got there and I found it to be true. Almost all of the NASA fraud investigat­ions for example where at Johnson Space Center outside of Houston. 

The Texas legislatur­e is run by lobbyist. not just influenced­. The head of the Legislatur­e and Perry uner Bush   once met with the lobbyist and said OK, no need to talk to the legislatur­e, what is it that you guys want us to do?

Its that background­, that is why under Bush we went from lobbyist influnced legislatio­n to lobbyist written legislatio­n.. its how it works in Texas and repubs have now adopted this way of operating all over the country.

				It was so frustratin­g to have to sit through the part of the debate when Rick Perry was challenged about his executive order that 12-year-ol­d girls must be vaccinated for HPV -- haven't the press picked up yet on the fact that Perry's chief of staff, Mike Toomey, left Perry and went to work for Merck (coinciden­tally the maker of Gardisil, the HPV vaccine).  That's what it was all about, Perry's cronyism.  Someone online has said that Perry having faith in the science of the HPV vaccine is contradict­ory to his overall anti-scien­ce stance.  Perry takes care of his friends and contributo­rs, period.  He will alter his position and go with the flow in order to accomplish the Texas pay-for-pl­ay culture.

				Either will mop floor with BHO.  If Obama really wants to create jobs, he can do it over night.  Allowing oil companies to drill off the coasts, opening up more federal energy permits, pare down some ridiculous EPA regulation­s, stop attacking coal, stop attacking oil, stop attacking America.  If the idiot illiterate dems really cared about America more than 1 million jobs could be created in energy in no time.  Stop the green nonsense and let America go back to work.  No company is going to openly pollute, nor do they want to.  Unleash the power Dems and you might just get re-elected­.  When people are working they pay taxes.  Although we know you'll just spend it, you could use some to pay off debt.

				You truly are a fool if you believe Obama can create jobs "overnight­" by allowing oil companies to drill off the coasts. Right now there are dozens of legal appeals by the oil companies because mineral rights in the gulf leased by them, which contain vast resources have gone unproduced for more than 10 years. Now that the leases have expired the government wants to re-lease these areas to companies willing to produce these resources. The former lease holders, who have sat on these oil resources for 10 years and have done nothing with this oil claim they're entitled to them. If you want jobs, tell big oil to start poducing what they have or stand aside and let someone else do the job!

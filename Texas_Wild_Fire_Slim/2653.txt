Survey: US falls to 5th in global competitivenessBy JOHN HEILPRIN - Associated Press | AP – 20 hrs ago

GENEVA (AP) — The U.S. has tumbled further down a global ranking of the world's most competitive economies, landing at fifth place because of its huge deficits and declining public faith in government, a global economic group said Wednesday.The announcement by the World Economic Forum was the latest bad news for the Obama administration, which has been struggling to boost the sinking U.S. economy and lower an unemployment rate of more than 9 percent.Switzerland held onto the top spot for the third consecutive year in the annual ranking by the Geneva-based forum, which is best known for its exclusive meeting of luminaries in Davos, Switzerland, each January.Singapore moved up to second place, bumping Sweden down to third. Finland moved up to fourth place, from seventh last year. The U.S. was in fourth place last year, after falling from No. 1 in 2008.The rankings, which the forum has issued for more than three decades, are based on economic data and a survey of 15,000 business executives.The forum praised the U.S. for its productivity, highly sophisticated and innovative companies, excellent universities and flexible labor market. But it also cited "a number of escalating weaknesses" such as rising government debt and declining public faith in political leaders and corporate ethics.The results of a survey of 142 nations comes a day before Obama is preparing to tackle jobs issues in a speech to the U.S. Congress, and just as U.S. polls show a clear majority of those surveyed say they disapprove of the way Obama is handling the economy.Switzerland held onto its top ranking, the forum said, because of "continuing strong performance across the board" with innovation, technological readiness, even-handed regulation and having one of the world's most stable economic environments.Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, was sixth, followed by the Netherlands and Denmark. Japan came in ninth, and Britain was 10th. France was 18th, and Greece, saddled with debt, fell to 90th.The report looked at broader trends: While the U.S. slipped, emerging markets gained traction. China took 26th place, highest among major emerging economies; Brazil was 53rd; India was 56th; and Russia was 66th."Fiscal imbalances that have been building up around the world are really a danger to future competitiveness, in terms of the ability of countries to invest in those things that will be very important for competitiveness going forward, things like education, infrastructure and so on," said Jennifer Blanke, an economist with the forum.

SINGAPORE IS TOO SMALL A COUNTRY TO BECOME A POWER TO RECKON WITH.
IN FACT, MANILA HAS EVEN  BIGGER POPULATION THAN SINGAPORE.
INDONESIA IS ALSO AN ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY. 
CHINA IS THE POWER THAT WILL RISE AFTER U.S.
mark my words and set them on stone.

Are you happy now, Obama??  You are accomplishing in 3 yrs what the communists in Russia could not....the destruction of our economy and therefore our ability to defend and/or protect our borders.
My goals for 2012::::pray, vote Obama OUT, buy more ammo.

Well sir, California is Ranked 49th in the Nation in Education, so what do the do ? Now there is a Class added for High School Students, Gay History, Yup, Gay History. That tells you were their Priority is, not Science and Math that is pretty clear, Pathetic and Pitiful. Go ahead Obama and Democrats !! California is their Poster Child for Socialism, Destroy America with your Liberal Poppycock.

When it comes to education, the Feds take your money at 20% or more your entire life, when your kids go to college they get NOTHING. I take that back they get private loans. All the Pell Grants, subsidized and non subsidized Fed loans go to the poor who never paid for any of it. That is the Democrat dream. Kids squashed by Student loans that sweetheart deals made sure can never be forgiven even in bankruptcy. The poor don't complain, the rich don't complain and college kids get dumber. Many good prospects are now refusing to go to school because they have seen what that debt does to the older siblings. It is spreading while Obama wants to give even more to those who don't pay a single dime. Guess you see where socialism leads, how does it go... from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs.

The US education system slowly stared weakening in the 1960s, then spend up when kids started forming "mandatory" social cliques in secondary education.

I once searched up on Google information on the different crazy cliques kids split up into during middle and high school years. You know, the preppies and jocks, whom the whole school staff trust, and the social outcasts, the nerds, geeks, goths, punks, skaters, and other non-comformists. 

I found a website of a long essay written by a professional sociologist on this. He said it was perfectly normal and healthy kids split up this way in secondary education. But in other nations this adolescent behavior is nonexistent. In other nations such true insanity could never exist where all the kids take education very seriously and would rather focus all the energy they have in school to achieve they best they can. These social cliques in secondary education are just a younger version of our fractured society. 

In the East Asian nations, if you are not a nerd or geek about your education you face intense social ostricization. Girls want to date the smartest boy in school, not the bling bling thug drop out or the retarded football jock. 

If I could, I would love to meet face-to-face with this socialist who defended the social cliques of secondary education as normal, and punch in his nose so hard to turn it inside out, even if he is a 400 lb. man.

American system is the most competitive in the world and free.  Our economy will rebound. 

Free market and free economy has always worked. Yes, few bumps here and there. Economy is cyclic event we can not do much about it.

Alternative socialism and communist and that is even worst.

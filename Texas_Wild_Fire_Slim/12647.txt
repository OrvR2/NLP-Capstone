Bastrop, Texas Wildfire - Hwy 71 is open from Bastrop to Smithville. This is what the fire has caused just along the Highway. This was filmed 9-10-11 at approximately 2:30 pm headed from Bastrop "Tahitian Drive at Highway 71" to about Smithville Texas. Many trees are still standing but burned beyond coming back. Most of the famous and beautiful Loblolly Pines that made this area special and famous "The Lost Pines" are now gone. This is truly a disaster!

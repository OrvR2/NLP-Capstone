US men convicted of triple child-slaying set freeBy Joseph Krauss | AFP – Fri, Aug 19, 2011

Three US men convicted as teenagers of kidnapping, torturing and mutilating three eight-year-old Cub Scouts in May 1993 were set free on Friday after serving nearly 20 years in jail.
The "West Memphis Three" -- Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley -- were convicted in a 1994 trial marked by local hysteria over allegations that the grisly killings were part of a Satanic ritual.
The three boys -- Steve Branch, Chris Byers, and Michael Moore -- were found in a ditch, stripped naked and hog-tied. Byers had bled to death after his penis was cut off and the other two had drowned in the muddy water.
The three convicts have always maintained their innocence, however, and a 1996 documentary questioning the conviction led actors Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder and Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder to embrace their cause.
Investigators found no physical evidence to connect the three to the murders, and recent DNA testing -- which did not exist at the time -- found only inconclusive evidence pointing to two completely different individuals, leading the Arkansas state supreme court to set Friday's hearing.
Fearing a new trial following nearly two decades of knotted legal appeals, prosecutors agreed to a deal in which the three pleaded guilty in return for their being sentenced only to the 18 years they had already served.
"Today's proceeding allows the defendants the freedom of speech to say they are innocent, but the fact is, they just pled guilty," District Prosecuting Attorney Scott Ellington said.
"I strongly believe that the interests of justice have been served today... The legal tangle that has become known as the West Memphis Three case is finished."
The three teenagers insist they are innocent, and Baldwin said he was opposed to the plea deal but agreed to it to save Echols from death row.
"In the beginning, we told nothing but the truth that we were innocent and they sent us to prison for the rest of our lives for it," Baldwin told reporters.
"Then we had to come here, and the only thing the state would do for us was to say: 'Hey, we'll let you go, but only if you admit guilt.' That's not justice no matter how you look at it.
"They're not out there trying to find who really murdered those boys."
The original case was based on an apparent confession by Misskelley, then 17, in a tape-recorded interview with police, a statement he later recanted.
He then refused to repeat the confession even when he was offered a more lenient prison term than the life sentence he eventually received.
The confession led to the conviction of Echols, then 18 and the alleged ringleader, who was sentenced to death, and Baldwin, who received a life sentence.
Prosecutors sought to present the murders as part of cult ritual, pointing out -- during the trial in the conservative southern town -- that Baldwin wore black tee-shirts and listened to heavy-metal bands like Metallica.
The 1996 documentary "Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills" presented the teenagers as having been unfairly singled out because they were nonconformists and raised questions about the trial.
One key prosecution witness later said she had fabricated her testimony under police pressure, and her son, a friend of the deceased boys who was eight at the time, has said police "messed with my words," according to the Arkansas Times, which has closely followed the case since 1993.
The DNA evidence, while inconclusive, linked a hair found at the scene of the crime to the stepfather of one of the victims and another hair to a friend of the stepfather, according to the Arkansas Times.
Family members of two of the victims have in recent years come out in support of the three, saying they were wrongfully convicted.
"They did not kill my son," John Mark Byers, the adoptive father of one of the boys, told reporters outside the courthouse on Friday.
"This is not right, and the people of Arkansas need to stand up and raise hell, because three innocent men are going to have to claim today they are guilty... and that's bull(expletive)."

I'd like to know what they are doing with the new DNA evidence now.  So this means they don't have to go after the real killers if the original 3 admit guilt.  That's our justice system for you, sounds like lazy police work to me.

An easy solution to the death penalty conundrum. For those crimes that should be "capital" crimes, the sentence should be tied to the level of assurance of guilt not just the crime or the victims. That is, we need a new standard of "guilty". One could be found guilty enough that the state has a compelling reason to imprison him/her but not to execute. This gives the chance of freedom should new evidence come to light. In other cases, the "guilt" is so over-whelming that the only option would be quick (no appeals) execution.

They say one of those boys wore black teeshirt and listened to metallica, so what my son did too but he also was an honor roll student played all sports got an mvp in football and went on to college still listens to metallica so should I be worried that if something awful happens around his campus that he will get the blame all because of his music or a black teeshirt?

They made them plead guilty so they didn't have to pay them for wrongful prosecution.

It sounds like some pressure was applied by the police to get the confession and witness testimony.These three should never have pleaded guilty. If they had been retried, the state would have most likely set them free anyway if their lawyers were any good. And now prosecuters can sit on their butts and not have to worry about persuing the real killers. What an outrage!

"what a bunch of crap they find these guys didn't do it..they miss out on their youth..and the legal system makes them plead guilty to exonerate the idiots that put them away to make themselves look good..how do they look now? and these guys get no compensation?"

There is no god, and "prayer" is but a Hoax.

Where was "god" to help these men out?

Christians and other Believers will, of course, seek to rationalize all their suffering...

Religion is complete bull****.

Since no more such crimes were committed in the area after these three were locked up one would be led to believe the police identified and arrested the killers and they were convicted. Most everyone will recant their initial confession once they talk to a lawyer and find out that they can. The justice system is screwed up in that three killers like this can be freed after a while. This means the capital punishment system needs to be overhauled to make sure the death penalty is carried out within one year of a jury of 12 finding the person guilty.

This is absolutely an injustice. If DNA was found from step-father and his friend, then why in the hell did these boys go to jail for this heinous crime. The case should be re-open if the state law agrees to re-examine conclusive DNA linked to someone  other than the 3 victims. Like fa real what is the statue of limitation concerning murder in this particular state.

Hey, I must be a murderer too!! Where the hell is evidence these days? I mean, if the evidence isn't strong enough, maybe there's something wrong with the conclusions. just maybe.

Wrong move. Considering that the assailants were old enough to realize the depth of their crimes, a life sentence at minimum would be appropriate, if not a death sentence. What is happening to this world?

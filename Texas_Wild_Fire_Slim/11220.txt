@ilovety65 lol, then we are really in agreement. while obama has been a big disappointment on so many levels, if this country elects perry to the presidency, we will have taken a step back in time by over 100 years.
the guy is a texASS sized moron in so many ways. ﻿

@wntoply6 perry is an asshole extreme.and no,I don't think the is like the wrath of God.THAt belongs to man.And FEMA can kiss my ass, they ordered all volunteer firemen to stand down while they TRY to﻿ get their act topgether.....katrina alll over again.
My nick name for perry is Mr. std,and he is a whore delux,in more ways than one.You think obama is bad?just wait...

@ilovety65 lol, you don't get it do you!.
should it happen to my state & should the governor decide to hold a prayer meeting or what the hell perry called it, we'd drum him out of office & the state...immediately!
my point is, praying to some god doesn't prevent a drought, nor is texASS being punished for "allowing the faggot agenda to exist in our society". never has, never will.
if you think so, then you belong in﻿ bellevue or whatever mental hospital is in your area.
got it now? maybe not!

@10bill99 your mama & dadda must have been spendin all their texASS nights prayin with your "christian" governor so that you didn't live close to the fires.
so bless your king size texASS heart & your king size governor for that, cause nothing else is working in your big ASS state to ease the drought!
but my question﻿ is what the fuck have you people done wrong that has raised the wrath of god? is it the hate your state has for blacks, hispanics, gays, jews, et al? tell me, i'd like to know!

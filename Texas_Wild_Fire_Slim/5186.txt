9/11 first responders left out of 10th anniversary eventBy Claudine ZapClaudine ZapPostsEmailBy Claudine Zap | The Upshot – Wed, Aug 17, 2011

9/11 Memorial at Ground ZeroPresident Obama will be there. So will former president George W. Bush and former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani. And, of course, the current mayor, Michael Bloomberg, will attend.
But Sept. 11 first responders, the emergency workers who helped with the rescue and recovery efforts 10 years ago, will be denied entry to the 9/11 National Memorial on the 10th anniversary of the attacks.
The 90,000 or so firefighters, police officers, and civilian volunteers who rushed toward the burning twin towers are not invited to the ceremonies on Sept. 11.
Mayor Bloomberg confirmed that the day would be reserved for victims' families. "Family members only will be allowed to walk onto the plaza, look at their loved ones' names, look down into the voids," he said, referring to the reflecting pools in the footprints of the two towers. Bloomberg added, "The first day, it's reserved for those family members who lost somebody on 9/11."

And, in fact, first responders have never been officially invited to the events. But that doesn't make it right, says John Feal, founder of an advocacy group for first responders, many of whom are now battling cancer and other diseases. Feal, a first responder himself, told CNN, "The best of the best that this country offered 10 years ago are being neglected and denied their rightful place."
In fact, as construction of the 9/11 National Memorial continues, passes are required for those who wish to visit the site. The passes, which are free, are for a specified date and time.
When the online reservation system opened, the 5,000 passes for the opening date to the public, Sept. 12, were snapped up within an hour. Since then, the memorial foundation has made more slots available.

Really!!! They too lost members of their units when the towers came crushing down, while trying to save those trapped inside. How shameful. All who were there SHOULD BE allowed to attend..

think about why they are not allowed to be there amongst the victims families people.   If you knew the truth or had suspicions of foul play and you were there on that fateful day and saw the truth first hand, wouldn't you tell the victims what happened and comfort them, or slip up and tell them and comfort them?   either way a lot suspicions could start a riot or another call for an investigation into 9/11.  they do not want that, hence the denials from them.

Logistics does not allow for the fire and policemen/women to attend?  Logistics does not allow for some of the relatives of those who lost their lives in the terrorist attack by Islamists to attend?
Then why is there a 9/11 Freedom Rally on September 11 at 3pm at Park Place and West Broadway including those who are refused admittance to the "official ceremony" in attendance?
Only the sycophants like Bloomberg, Obama, and their ilk are in attendance at ground zero.  What a joke - on the American People (Patriots)!!!!!
God Save The Republic.

This is complete #$%$ Who were the ones @ ground zero risking their lives goind into those buildings and pulling people out. First responders, FDNY, NYPD, and all of EMS. Where was the President? away from all of it. Where was the Mayor? not @ ground zero helping I can tell you that much or maybe he was but he wasn't helping pull people out of buildings. Read Repot From round Zero by Dennis Scott. It tells different stories from people and their experience @ ground zero. The 10 year memorial, total #$%$

In the spirit of 'truth' on the 10th anniversary of 9/11; a new and powerful video by the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth.

911 was a inside job and the first responders are questioning the official report, of course they don't want them there out of fear of being exposed. And now the seating issue, all they have to do is hold the ceremony in increments. For instance the victims families can have a morning service and the first responders can have a afternoon service and a evening service and on through the night if necessary. There's really no excuses, it just shows how people cant get along and come together and work out their differences. The Globalists are testing the bounds of reality. If the American people will put up with this travesty there's no limit to what they can get away with. There are truly dark days ahead. You think 911 was bad, you haven't seen anything yet.

Well then, Let Obama or some other official sit it out and let the 1st responders be there, where they belong. Right up front. These people risk their lives, saw death and destruction while others sat on their butt. This is sad, horrible misjudgment. If they don't have the room for a venue this size, make cuts in other areas. Do NOT cut off you hand, that feeds you.. ( or should I say) The Hands that SAVES you..

You people are well intentioned but ignorant. 90,000 people in 16 acres? Sorry, but that's not going to happen. You would need about 300 acres to hold all those people, not to mention parking and toilet facilities. Bloomberg isn't snubbing people, he just doesn't have the technology to make a venue larger in the inside than it is on the outside. I'm going to give him a pass for not being Doctor Who.

I am sure a few of those first responders lost people close to them, brother firefighters, policemen and fellow New Yorkers..If you think about it, we all lost fellow Americans. God Bless the first responders.

Write or call your Representatives and Senators. If they're planning to attend, then suggest that they give up their place for a responder to attend in their place.

Daily Horoscope for September 15

 Capricorn
Overcome your fears by facing them squarely today; it may be time to 'let go and let God' in certain situations. You may find that by releasing your fears you are better able to accomplish your goals... the fear of being inferior may be holding you back, but as Venus enters your mid-heaven, you'll be everyone's darling at work, or in the public sphere. This is a very intuitive and perceptive day, so take note of the impressions you experience.

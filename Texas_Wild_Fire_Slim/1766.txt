Oh, Beatrice. You were doing so well. 
After bombing spectacularly at the Royal Wedding in that squiggly Philip Treacy hat, you hired Emma Watson's stylist at a cool $2,400/day rate to polish your sartorial rep.
And it worked -- for a while. Then you stepped out last night and blew the style cred to shreds.
Princess Beatrice and her sister Princess Eugenie both donned shiny outfits on Monday night to celebrate the late Freddie Mercury's would-be 65th birthday. 
Partying with Queen's Roger Taylor and Brian May, the royal sisters wore both colorful cocktail dresses and black high heels.
Bea chose a glossy purple dress with appliqued flowers with sheer black sleeves attached, topping the outfit off with giant, heavy silver becklance.
Her younger sister Eugenie wore a red dress with a sparkly silver shrug thrown over her shoulders. She also sported neon orange nails.
We're not sure what to make of the two get-ups... except that we're pretty sure Princess Beatrice's fancy shmancy celebrity stylist didn't pick them out. 
Check out the sisters below.




Quick Poll
The princesses' party dresses:




HIT! Just how young, fun-loving royals should dress. 



MISS! Just, no.

				For Pete's sake leave these two young women alone.  Sure they have questionab­le fashion sense but they're pretty girls and perhaps they would like a little attention.  They're princesses but we hear more about Pippa and her sometimes questionab­le style, so maybe Bea and Eugenie feel a bit overlooked­.  If wearing "unusual" attire is this the most offbeat thing that they do they deserve to be patiently understood­..  Their lives haven't been all that wonderful despite being a royal.

				These two young women are both in the public eye far too often for being rather innocent and simply the victims of parental birth...ea­ch has looked beautiful on quite a few occasions.  Yes, a few flubs here and there, but I've seen young actresses and starlets who  had all and still not known enough to wear proper support garments - ruining their expensive gowns....I think these two are in the prime of life and having fun (including their non-hats).­..they take risks, probably listen to each other on fashion, and offered more by those designers seeking publicity.­..they are having fun so leave them alone - they are fine, just the way they are.

				Did no one notice just how skinny Princess Beatrice has become. She is wearing the shear black under her dress top simply to keep it up. She is so skinny the top of her dress doesn't fit her at all. It looks like she has a problem. In the wedding photos she was a normal weight. But now she is skin and bones.That is why her eyes look bigger than usual also. I hope her family has noticed and are doing something to help her. When young people get that skinny so fast it is usually not good. God bless her and her family.

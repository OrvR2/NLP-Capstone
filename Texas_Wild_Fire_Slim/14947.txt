A fire caused by a plane crash threatened 800 homes or structures in Tehachapi, California, on Monday, with nearly 5,000 acres ablaze in rugged terrain, according to state and local officials.
Six hundred firefighters were on the scene trying to corral the 4,759-acre fire.
A relief center has been set up at Jacobsen Junior High School in Tehachapi for evacuees.

the prophet
Fellow Americans, when are you going to realize that our Government is the reason and the cause we have become impoverished, policed and subordinated, unhealthy. uneducated, socially disconnected. Living in a fast decaying society ruled and told what to do, on our next elections donât vote for no one in protest, donât elect no new party to run
our lives and much less the home we live in, let the
Government run out. This is step one, not as a
prophet but as a reformist, this is the American I see
and we should have for generation to come.

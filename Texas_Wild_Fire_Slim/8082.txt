Video: Dynamo Minsk’s hockey funeral for Lokomotiv crash victims By      Greg Wyshynski


Members of the Kontinental Hockey League's Lokomotiv Yaroslavl were flying to Minsk for their season opener when their plane crashed soon after takeoff on Wednesday. Forty-three passengers died, including nearly all of Lokomotiv's players and coaching staff, in one of the greatest tragedies to ever hit the hockey community.
On Thursday night, Dynamo Minsk players still skated out on the ice of their arena — not for a game, but for a remarkable "hockey funeral" for their fallen opponents, in front of stands packed with fans in mourning. This is as surreal, heartbreaking and moving a moment as we've seen on the rink:

From Russia Today:
All tickets for the game had been sold long before the tragedy. Soon after the sad news spread worldwide, the game's organizers decided to arrange a mass at the arena, honoring the legacy of the team.
Not a single ticket had been returned as the ceremony was held in the packed arena. Each spectator brought flowers. All the Belarusian leadership, including President Aleksandr Lukashenko, were present at the event.
Never was the arena that silent as 37 huge portraits of the players and staff were placed on the ice. A requiem mass was performed by an orchestra, while portraits of the departed Yaroslavl friends and icons appeared on the scoreboard.
As you can see, part of the tribute included Dynamo players firing pucks into their own net to symbolize a defeat to the Lokomotiv team that perished on Wednesday. Later, flowers were placed inside the goals in their memory.
Here is the full 34-minute ceremony via the KHL (s/t Captain Orange)

Tributes are continuing to be held across the globe for these players — rain or shine, New Jersey Devils fans are gathering at Championship Plaza in Newark for a memorial at 5 p.m. ET on Friday. If you have any images or reports from a memorial near you, hit us at puckdaddyblog@yahoo.com.
s/t to Monica McAlister for the video.

0 users disliked this comment Bonnie  1 hour ago Report Abuse This is the reason why I think that no team,football,hockey or any team should all go on one plane.I think they should go on separate ones,Like families too,they should go on diffrent flights that way if the plane goes down you don't lose the whole family

0 users disliked this comment hockeygirl525 2 hours ago Report Abuse Simply reading the articles about this tragedy brings me to tears.   I do not feel that I can bring myself to watch this.   Not yet anyway.   

Thank you all for posting such lovely comments!   This accident has touched so many peoples lives. The friends, families and coworkers of all of these individuals will never be the same.   This crash has caused the hockey world as a whole to lose an amazing amount of talent.   Not to mention the fact that these men were gentlemen off the ice as well.   Thank you again for your show of support... hockey fans or not.    :)

0 users disliked this comment MotorCityMadman 3 hours ago Report Abuse Although there were Red Wings on that plane (Salei, McCrimmon, Liv), I could not imagine having the Wings team plane end in such horrific tragedy.   People here in Detroit would perish of heart stroke and despair, such is the love of hockey and its players.   Hockey players, such down to earth good men.   While there are countless tragedies and people dying everyday across the world, this sad event rips at your heart horrifically.   Bless to Team Lokomotiv and the Russian People.   After all, we are ALLIN THE SAME FAMILY.   It is just a shame it takes such a terrible loss to remind us of this fact.

1 users disliked this comment Theoutlaw 3 hours ago Report Abuse I've only been hockey fan for about a year or two now, but even I couldn't help break down after watching the full ceremony. It really is a credit not only to Minsk or to the KHL but to all hockey fans that they've all stopped to pay their respects in their own way to players they've never heard of before. Just one more way that sports unite us all. RIP Lokomotiv, we'll always hold you in our hearts.

Also - very proud of the comments on this article and glad to see that we can actually all come together and not bicker at each other - not one negative thought.   Thanks to all of you!   

RIP

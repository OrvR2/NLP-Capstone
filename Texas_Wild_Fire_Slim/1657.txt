Lady Gaga will never stop wowing. Whether she's in a wheel chair, clad in meat or dressed as a greaser, we've come to, as Gaga herself said, expected the unexpected. 
Now the singer covers the October issue of Harper's Bazaar and is looking more shocking than ever: natural. 
While she was the magazine's cover star just a couple months back, now Gaga is in soft black and white--without protrusions or even a dash of glitter--to tell us no matter what she's wearing or which persona she's exuding, she is the same underneath. 
"Whether I'm wearing lots of makeup or no makeup, I'm always the same person inside."

Mic Wright: My Television Week: The Hour And The Glee Project


							            							            Switching over from the news to watch the start of a story that looks set to consider the way the police, the media and the government interact feels right. Despite taking place in 1956, just on the cusp of Suez, the series has fortuitously arrived as the country is gripped by another crisis of government. Meanwhile, featuring a collection of 'misfits' who would, like the current cast of Glee, easily rule any normal high school with their bright white smiles and perky charm, The Glee Project is frighteningly positive.

Hadani Ditmars: Racism in Canada: A Night at the Roxy


							            							            I wonder if Colleen Mitchell White was aware of the statement she was making when she arrived at Vancouver's Roxy Nightclub and was denied entry because she was wearing moccasins. And what was the doorman thinking? 'Drunk Indian woman prostitute buffalo hunter?'

Silpa Kovvali: Just Dance


							            							            Lady Gaga's "freak" schtick has made her rich and famous, but money and Twitter followers don't equate to respect. Gaga is more than welcome to choose the former over the latter, until she starts lampooning an important cause.

				For all the people who talk about the gimmicks, I wonder if they would think David Bowie or Elton John would have been as popular w/o the props, attire, etc etc to make them appear different from the rest?

I enjoyed her first album and a half, but haven't really taken a liking to her second full-lengt­h album other than "Judas".  I like what she stands for and appreciate her talent.  I think I'm just Gaga'd out with the constant attention she receives.

Wish LaRoux, Paloma Faith, or even Lily Allen would have received as much attention.

				I have to agree with you.  I don't see any need for all of her costumes and make-up and strangenes­s.  While I'm not really a fan per se, she is genuinely VERY talented and there is no reason to come up with gimmicks to distract from that.  But, as my husband always says, she is BRILLIANT at marketing and what she's marketing is HERSELF.

				I can do without the makeup plastered on so thick that you can carve your name in it.
I like the way my wife wears very little and looks fab.  But I was always that way before I met her.  I never was attracted to a caked on makeup face.  Nor overly hairspraye­d and overly perfumed.  Natural.  Natural beauty.

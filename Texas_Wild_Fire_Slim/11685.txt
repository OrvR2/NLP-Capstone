There are many different individuals involved in the timber selling process, but it is important to understand that a professional forester is the most valuable resource available to you.  A professional forester is one who has attained a degree in forestry from a Society of American Forester’s accredited university and is trained and skilled at managing your forest resource.  These professionals can help you manage your land and timber resource while protecting, enhancing and maximizing your enjoyment of the many benefits of land ownership.  It is very important to utilize a professional forester in any management activity that takes place in your forest to make sure that the best activity is implemented and that you don’t miss out on future opportunities to improve the resource by making poor decisions today.  Many of the common mistakes in selling timber can be avoided by utilizing a professional forester as they can guide you in making the best decision for enhancing the forest while getting the most out of it.

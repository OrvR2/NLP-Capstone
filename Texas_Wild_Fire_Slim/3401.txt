"Fox and Friends" anchor Gretchen Carlson and Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz had a heated clash on Tuesday morning over comments a union leader made at President Obama's Labor Day rally.
Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa got a lot of applause in Detroit when he said of the Tea Party, "let's take these son-of-a-bitches out and give America back to America where we belong." President Obama was not present for Hoffa's comments, but conservatives quickly pounced, asking the White House to condemn Hoffa. The White House has so far refused to issue any statement on the controversy, and Wasserman Schultz followed the same playbook when she spoke to Carlson.
Her appearance was ostensibly about Obama's upcoming jobs announcement, but Carlson steered the conversation towards Hoffa.
"Some people are saying that that's violent language, Congresswoman," she said. Wasserman Schultz declined to comment.
"We need to make sure that we focus on the middle class and working families," she said. "But wait a minute," Carlson said. "[Hoffa said] 'let's take these sons of bitches out'...and that's your response?"
"My response is that we should be working together," Wasserman Schultz said, beginning to talk about jobs. Carlson cut her off. 
"I'm talking about what Jimmy Hoffa said yesterday," she said. "I know you'd like to focus on language--" Wasserman-Schultz replied.
"it was very serious language!" Carlson said. Wasserman Schultz actually laughed at this.
"Are you kidding me?" she said. "You take a walk with me through Tea Party rallies." After more crosstalk, Wasserman Schultz turned her aim on Carlson.
"How many times have you called out coarse language at Tea Party rallies on this network. Almost never," she said. "Plenty," Carlson shot back. "I sit in the middle of the couch. I'm fair and balanced, Debbie. What is your response?"

																These initiatives would  give corporate CEOs the confidence they need to start spending, on new investments and hiring, some of the $2 trillion now sitting in their treasuries. And it is that eventual spending which will sustain long-term job creation.

				Notice Fox edited out Hoffa's wording about getting the vote out so we can take these SOB's out. With this wording it is clear he was referring to kicking the SOB's out of office via the election. Fox shows its true colors again by only including what it wants to show. Forget about the facts and forget about Fox ever being fair and balanced.

				"Gretchen" lacks profession­alism.  Calling a U.S. Representa­tive by her first name is unprofessi­onal.  Has she apologized to Rep. Wasserman-­Schultz?  Or is it because the Representa­tive is a woman that FOX thinks they don't have to show any respect?  Also "Gretchen" looks consistent­ly angry and petulant.  She's another reason not to watch FOX.

				The one question I have is how can you say seriously, that Obama has both lost jobs, and increased federal jobs? I do realize that the unemployme­nt raye has increased, but her question was so poor.
Also, Hoffa didn't have a civil discussion­? Umm, it was a rally, not an open forum discussion by an elected official. Geez Gretch, even the GOP and Tea Party ELECTED officials don't have them.  And Hoffa was much more civil then Ryan was to the 71 year old at his paid rally.

"How many times have you called out coarse language at Tea Party rallies on this network. Almost never," she said. "Plenty," Carlson shot back. "I sit in the middle of the couch. I'm fair and balanced, Debbie. What is your response?"

So this BlondeBimb­ette thinks that because she has the middle seat on the couch between two rabid teathuglic­an lap dogs, that that somehow it qualifies her as the "fair and balanced" one.

Laughable!

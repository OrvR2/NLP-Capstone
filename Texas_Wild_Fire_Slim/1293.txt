An adorable hound dog in Boulder, Colorado has made the history books with his droopy, record-breaking ears. 'Early Show' correspondent Terrell Brown takes a look at this famous hound's achievement. "Do your ears hang low?" Brown sings as we get our first look at Harbor, the official Guinness record holder for having the longest ears of any living dog. 

A photo shows Harbor's ears held outstretched as Brown reports, "His left ear, on the right side of your screen, just over 12 inches long. His right ear, on the left side of the screen 13 and-a-half inches long. Experts say their long ears help hounds sweep scents toward their nose when they're out hunting for game."

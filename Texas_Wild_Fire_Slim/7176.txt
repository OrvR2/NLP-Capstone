Shocking racism uncovered in the New York Fire Service






The years haven't much eased Irene Smith's pain. Some days are good, she says. Some less so. But her son, Leon W. Smith Jr., is always on her mind.
It was Leon Smith's dream to become a firefighter, Smith said. Growing up in Brooklyn, N.Y., the family lived right across the street from a firehouse. She said she always knew just where to find her boy. "He knew his calling even then," she said.

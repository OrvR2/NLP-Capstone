June 28, 2011 – COLLEGE STATION, Texas – Most Texas counties are experiencing severe drought, and it’s important to keep in mind this holiday weekend that just a little spark can start a massive wildfire. Texas Forest Service continues to urge caution when it comes to any outdoor activity that can cause a spark – from outdoor grilling or building a campfire to parking a car on dry grass or shooting celebratory fireworks in approved areas. More than 90 percent of Texas wildfires are caused by humans. The most frequent cause is debris burning.According to authorities, the recent Dyer Mill Fire in Grimes County, where more than 5,200 acres were burned and at least 30 homes lost, was started by a barbecue pit. Texas Forest Service’s Prevention and Mitigation Team, led by Bruce Woods, is tasked with conducting public education campaigns, working with the media, hosting town hall meetings, overseeing prescribed burning and reaching out to those affected or displaced by wildfire.“Wildfires are a community-wide problem, which means reducing risks to homes and property is everyone’s responsibility,” said Woods. “More than 80 percent of wildfires in Texas occur within 2 miles of a community.”The team is available to work with homeowners and communities to answer questions and implement strategies to protect home and other structures from wildfire. For example, potential losses can be reduced by adopting Firewise landscaping practices 100 to 200 feet around your home. That includes moving firewood and clearing dead and dense vegetation.Remember, you can help Texas have a wildfire-free Fourth of July.For more information, visit www.texasfirestorm.org and www.texasfirewise.org.

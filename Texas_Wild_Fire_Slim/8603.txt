   Organizing a SAT Prep Schedule for the New School YearPRWeb – 1 hr 51 mins ago





   B Line Test Prep's online SAT prep course fits into any schedule to help students prepare for the test.San Diego, CA (PRWEB) September 08, 2011  Back to school is a time of mixed feelings for most high school students. Summer is coming to an end and a new school year is just beginning which means long gone are the days of sleeping until noon and spending countless hours in front of the television or with friends. For juniors and seniors preparing to take the SAT this year, back to school can seem even more overwhelming than usual.
However, preparing for the SAT doesn’t have to be a stressful thing. When you have the right SAT course, preparation can seem like the easy part of back to school. 
B Line Test Prep created their free SAT prep course to accommodate busy schedules. It’s unique set up is great for the student who just needs to brush up on material and learn the format of the test or for the person who needs detailed explanations to arrive at the correct answer.
One of the most important elements of test prep will be taking practice tests and reviewing questions answered incorrectly. Feeling in control and well informed about the test will help calm students’ nerves and allow them to enter test day feeling prepared.
After the summer, being back into the classroom can be challenging. Staying organized and setting aside blocks of time for homework, SAT preparation, extracurricular activities and social activities can help students get their schedules back under control. Putting together a schedule can help students get everything in order and feel like they are well prepared for a new school year to begin.

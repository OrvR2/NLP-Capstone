With friends like these who needs vigilantes? 
A Florida couple was arrested for allegedly trying to haul their friend back to jail, because she'd fallen off the wagon days after they paid her bail, The Daytona Beach News-Journal reported
Jose and Zaran Vega face false imprisonment charges in Daytona Beach for forcing Crystal Richelle, 27, into a minivan and taking her to a bail bondsman they hoped could jail her on Sunday, because she was allegedly abusing prescription painkillers, The News-Journal reported. The Vegas couple had recently sprung Richelle from county jail after 10 days in the slammer when she didn't appear in court to face charges that she passed bogus information to a pawnbroker, TV station WOFL said.
The friendship was put to a test when Jose Vega, 34, stormed into a home that Richelle was visiting and got into an argument with her about the drugs, WDBO radio said. Richelle was with her fiance who intervened when Vega tried to drag his bride-to-be out to the waiting minivan. Vega, however, punched him in the face, knocking him out, according to The Orland Sentinel. 
Vega then picked up his wife and drove the trio to a bail bondsman, but because the Vegas aren't licensed bail bondsmen, authorities slapped them with false imprisonment, according to The News Journal.. Jose faces additional battery charges.

				Too bad they lost their money they probably couldn't afford to lose. But bailing out a junkie was definitely not a smart move, they should have left her in jail. She only would have done a few months, long enough to get some help by the system.

				Anyone that would pay bail for someone on a "FAILURE TO APPEAR" charge deserves to lose their money.
As far as drugs go I say make them cheap and available and that would end a lot of robbery, theft, and home invasions as well as letting the worse offenders have access to the means with which to end themselves­.

				The couples taking some who was caught doing drugs to the bail bondsman..­..wouldn't pleading 'citizen arrest' be a good defense?

Afterall there no manuals on how to do a citizen arrest, the kidnapping charges is over bearing given the circumstan­ce, it appears they were trying to protect the money they put up to bail her 10 days prior.

				Why is that?  If I knew somebody was a junkie I wouldn't allow her within a mile of my place.  They'll do and say anything to get drugs.  Your possession­s don't mean a thing to them; they're just a way to get the stuff.  Your house becomes a flophouse for people who are at the mercy of chemicals.  All they can think about is getting your money to finance their habit.

When and if they're off the stuff and at least trying to get clean, that's different.  Obviously this girl wasn't anywhere near that point.

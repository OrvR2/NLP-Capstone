December 18, 2009--COLLEGE STATION, Texas--During the holiday season, Texas Forest Service is urging residents to take precautions to prevent wildfires and protect their property. The holiday season is a time for celebrating, not fighting wildfires.Christmas tree firesWhile Christmas tree fires are more likely to cause a house fire, a wildfire can result from the flames. Bruce Woods, Texas Forest Service mitigation and prevention department head said there are some things you can do to protect yourself, your home and your property. One of the first things you can do to prevent Christmas tree fires is to pick the right tree. “When choosing a Christmas tree, it is important to buy a fresh tree,” Woods said. “When you get the tree home, cut about two inches off the bottom because the very bottom has had time to dry out while you are getting it home. This new cut will allow more moisture to be taken up. Be sure to water your tree daily.”In almost half of all Christmas tree fires, electrical problems are the main factor. Be sure to purchase lights that are UL (Underwriter Laboratory) rated interior lights. However, do not think the danger ends just because the holidays are over and the tree is down. According to Mary Kay Hicks, fire prevention coordinator with Texas Forest Service, unsafe burning of wrapping paper, gift boxes and Christmas trees after Christmas could spark a wildfire. If you choose to burn your used wrapping paper, gift boxes and Christmas trees outside, Hicks said be sure to adhere to a few outdoor burning guidelines. She said that residents should not burn on dry, windy days and should keep a rake and water hose handy in case the fire escapes. Make sure to keep burn piles to a manageable size and stay with the fire until it is out cold. Check with your local officials before starting a fire to determine if a burn ban is in place. Also, consider recycling trees, rather than burning them. Hicks said used Christmas trees may be ground up for mulch or used to help stabilize sand dunes, build structure for fish in a lake or pond or provide shelter for birds and other wildlife. Firewood safetyAnother wildfire hazard during the holidays is firewood stacked too close to buildings. Firewood often is cured, or dried, so it is easier to light in a fireplace. This drying process does not just make it easier to light in a fireplace – it makes it easier to light anywhere. In addition, if the firewood is stacked too close to a structure it can lead a wildfire right up to the structure. Mahlon Hammetter, fire prevention specialist with Texas Forest Service, said firewood should always be stacked at least 30 feet away from all structures. “A stack of burning firewood can generate a lot of heat and can ignite the outside of a building or even radiate through glass windows and ignite furnishing inside a house,” Hammetter said. “Having a burning pile of wood right next to your house is the last thing you need any time of the year.”FireworksTexas Forest Service Fire Operations Chief Mark Stanford warns that Christmas trees and firewood are not the only fire dangers lurking around this time of year. Fireworks can be particularly disastrous and can start wildfires if not used properly. “Across Texas, residents will be using fireworks to celebrate Christmas and New Years,” Stanford said. “TFS wants everyone to be diligent in protecting themselves and to avoid accidental wildfires.”Sandra Taylor, TFS fire prevention specialist, says a few fireworks precautions should be taken to prevent wildfires. “Fireworks should never be used without adult supervision,” Taylor said. “Be sure to stay in safe areas, away from grass and brush which may be dried from freezes. Keep a bucket of water, a water hose and wet towels nearby in case they are needed to extinguish small fires.”Under Texas law, county government officials have the authority to restrict certain types of aerial fireworks when drought conditions exist or when hazardous fuel conditions are present during the winter months. County officials also consider drought conditions when determining outdoor burn bans for their counties. Texas Forest Service does not make decisions regarding restrictions on fireworks or outdoor burn bans. However, the state agency does provide drought condition information to counties. Stay safeBy following a few simple safety steps, you can help prevent wildfires and protect your property from any wildfires that may start.

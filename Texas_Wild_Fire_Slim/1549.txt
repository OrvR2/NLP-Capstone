Obama set to propose $300 billion economic plan: What’s the likely impact?By Zachary RothSenior National Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Zachary Roth | The Lookout – 12 hrs ago

AP Photo/Charles DharapakReports are now suggesting that President Obama will propose a $300 billion effort to jump-start the economy when he delivers a policy address before both houses of Congress tomorrow night. As we wrote yesterday, the package will likely include a mix of payroll tax cuts--an extension of the one now in place for employees, and a new one for employers--and spending on infrastructure projects, extended jobless benefits and aid to state and local governments.
But how much impact is a package of that size and makeup likely to have? And amid sky-high joblessness and the real threat of a double-dip recession, will Obama's proposal be up to the challenge?
Economists are doubtful.
"Three hundred billion dollars is better than nothing," Gus Faucher, the managing  director for macroeconomics at Moody's Analytics, told The Lookout.  "Would it be better if we had a bigger package? Yes."
That's not to say it won't have an effect. "If passed as proposed, it would have a significant impact on the economy," Paul Ashworth, chief US economist for Capital Economics, told The Lookout. But he agreed with Faucher that it wouldn't be enough to pull the economy out of the dumps for a sustained period. "It's just simply not big enough," he said.
Three hundred billion dollars represents about two percentage points of GDP, Ashworth said. So if the full Obama plan went into effect in the next year, it would bump economic forecasts for 2012 up from around 2 percent, where most are currently, to around 4 percent. Or, if spread out over a longer time period, it would add around half a  percentage point to growth for each of the next four years.
What would that mean for jobs? Based on what's known as "Okun's Law," economists say that a two percentage point rise in GDP translates to a decrease in unemployment of about 1 percentage point. So a $300 billion boost in spending might bring unemployment down from the current rate of 9.1 percent to somewhere around 8.1 percent.
But Ashworth warned that even that jolt likely wouldn't be enough to pull the United States back into a sustained "virtuous circle" of growth, given the economy's ongoing structural problems. He cited the twin drags of high household debt--a result of the housing boom and bust--and low business confidence.
Mark Thoma, an economics professor at the University of Oregon, agreed.
"If this is just a one-year plan, it will have an impact on employment during the first year, and there may be some residual going forward, but it will mostly die out after it ends," Thoma told The Lookout via email. "We need a sustained, year-after-year stimulus, one that remains until employment is doing better." Thoma did add, however, that a one-time shot is "better than nothing."
To give a sense of context, a $300 billion proposal would  represent less than one-tenth of the $4 trillion infrastructure spending  package over the next 10 years that some on the left have pushed for.
And of course, it's unlikely that the full $300 billion package  will pass. Thanks in part to the reluctance of GOP congressional leaders to green-light more spending,  Republican lawmakers will be deeply wary of signing off on everything  Obama asks for--even though the White House has said it plans to fund the additional spending with offsetting deficit reduction measures.
And that brings up another issue. Deficit-reduction measures could cancel out the impact of the package if they come too early--and we're not likely to know the timing of such cuts for a while. "If it's paid when the economy is doing better, i.e. in the future, no problem in terms of changing the calculations of what will happen now," Thoma said. "But if it's paid now, the increased taxes will offset the effects of the stimulus."
Yet another problem, Ashworth said, is that spending on infrastructure projects isn't an effective short-term way to boost growth. "There just aren't enough shovel-ready projects," he said, noting that the 2009 stimulus addressed many of those that had previously existed.
So in practical terms, whatever infrastructure spending Congress ends up approving likely will have to spread out over the next five to 10 years, rather than having an immediate impact.
And finally, a portion of the package--extensions of the employee payroll tax cut and jobless benefits, both of which are scheduled to expire at the end of this year--aims merely to maintain the status quo so things don't get worse, rather than representing any new stimulus.
As Ashworth put it: "It's more about avoiding a fiscal tightening."
Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist for IHS Global Insight, described the package as an effort to buy time. "All it does, it gives more time for households to build up their savings and reduce their debt," he told The Lookout. "It tries to fill in a huge hole in aggregate demand, and allow private sector to get on its own feet."
Gault, too, said he'd like to see a bigger package, though he acknowledged that it can be difficult to launch an effective stimulus effort quickly.
In other words, if Obama were to get everything he asks for, we'd likely see a modest boost to the economy, but not as sustained an impact as the situation calls for. And it's far more likely that the end product of tomorrow's proposals will be ven less than that.
As Gault summed things up: "We're gonna have a lot of unemployment in 2013 and 2014."

The Congress passed a $787 billion stimulus package on February 13, 2009.  It was a bust.  If $787 billion did not work, why does Obama and his Democrat cohorts think that $300 Billion would work?

Since when has winning the Nobel prize been a measure of accomplishment? I think Obama's 12 days in office, Al Gore's prize, Jimmy Carter, and Yassar Arafat proved that to be the case. The Nobel prize would have been given to Karl Marx if he were still alive! And Paul Krugman is a Socialist supporting a Socialist! Why does Krugman's support for deficit spending surprise you? He is an ideolog, and that is why he writes at the New York Slimes rather than having a real job! 

Krugman thinks that Keynes was the god of economics. But like men with like agendas think alike! Keynes was also a Socialist. And I know it isn't popular today to consider one's circle of friends and associates, but Keynes mother was thought of like-wise. Keynes best buddies were Bertrand Russel, the famous British communist and philosopher (at least he was a commie with a conscience!) and George Bernard Shaw, the Progressive or Fabian Socialist (quietly progressive communists) who said that the problem with the United States was our Constitution, because it prevented us from "killing the people we need to kill". Shaw was best buddies with Woodrow Wilson also. In fact it was Shaw who came up with the ideas for the gas chambers, and gave Hitler the idea! Don't believe me, look it up on youtube. So Krugman keeps some good company.

It is time for a New Deal FDR style. Obama should stop pandering to the Republican traitors to the Middle Class. Push for strong Progressive Legisliation. First end the Bush tax cuts and go back to the tax rates on the rich during FDR 90%. Give tax breaks only to corporations that support Unions and Made in the USA Products and services. Nationalize Health Care. Implement pre Reagan Years regulations of our banks and lenders. Bring our troops home from around the world in 90 days. Really support our troops not the military contractors who profit from endless wars. That is the start of restoring a strong middle class. Say no to the Tea Party idiots and yes to a New Deal Party.

So, this is the stimilus amount, oh, excuse me, we're not supposed to use the word stimilus, that he is throwing at the UNION workers for government construction jobs this time. I guess it pays to give big to the Liberals through the wallets of the union workers. I guess they think by changing the "HOT" words that the general public will not get it. Sorry Mr. President, the same thing but just worded differently is still "THE SAME THING". 2012, we need to overwhelmingly just say 'NO" to this administration and its payoffs and cronyism. 2012 anybody will be better than this.

we need a plan that can bring unemployment or more than a year.  That is what we really need and like they said 300 billion is only anough to bring unemployment down by one percent and once the projects are done there goes the unemployment again.  We need to have the government help people get new skills that are needed in this country.  That would be the best way to go.  More student aid to get degrees needed since we have to relize jobs are not coming back once they are gone.  Just saying i know everyone on hear is going to think that im a arrogant but this is my oppinion.

I Like President Obama approach to this economy. He is being honest and trying to help us all. Tea Party people lie, deceive and arent really trying to help anybody but rich and powerful (some not all) groups of people.  I have no need for any Tea Party people. I do respect them but I do not believe in what they are doing.  There are probably(hopefully) some fine Tea Party People that want to help those that financially are struggling but I feel they are not really in it to do the right things.

The US is still the World's wealthiest, most powerful Country...why doesn't the government put the people 1st and just invest trillions in the economy.....? that's positive and serious re-election talk ! 300 mil. is a drop in the pan......only a buck for every American ! There again many, if not most in Congress and the Senate...were hardly put there by the poor and struggling masses so they'd probably reject ANY plan to get America back on it's working feet !

There are two things that can never change their stripes: A tiger, and a Marxist! When Lenin had the "kulaks" (successful farmers) killed by the CHEKA in 1918, he created massive food shortages with his central planning. Mao who this administration seems to love, did exactly the same thing. The solution for Lenin was to exterminate 10million people. He couldn't change what is was! The same can be said for Mao, Max Robespierre, Hitler, Mussolini, or any other Statist! And so it is.....

So what does this imply? More of the same! Obama can not turn his back on big government programs and central planning, which does have a certain appeal for the "recipient class" since it is all free and comes from "Obama's stash!" We need more "green jobs" programs like the one in Seattle where $20million was spent to hire 14 guys who's minority status was probably guaranteed, to weatherize 3 homes! Three homes! Lets see, that is only $6.67million per home. So why are you Tea-Party types complaining? Do you want them to freeezzzze to death? Or perhaps if we had given $1billion instead of $535million to Solyndra Inc. Heck why pile up on them, they were the 3rd solar panel company to go belly up! 

You see Mr. President, if an idea has "value", the private sector and investors would be clamoring to get involved, kinda like buying gold these days ugh Mr. Anthony Weiner? Yes, when business is stimulated by government, not only is the money poorly spent, but what happens when the money runs out? Oh, I see! Government stimulated jobs are only temporary, and do nothing to permanently boost the work force. Every genius from Harvard knows this right? Then why are you trying to destroy our economy? No wait, don't answer that! You accuse conservatives with not caring about the poor, or the working union man. What about my grand-kids Mr. President? Heck, what about our kids? 

I have a suggestion. Why not make everyone a government worker, sort of a AFL-CIO "army" of labor ants? We all work for the government and get our $20 a month allowance and food coupons and 400 sq.ft. apartment!!!! Now that is a plan any socialist can get their arms around. Socialism doesn't raise the basement, it lowers the roof! No more money and class envy! No  more envy in school about grades! And we all get plastic surgery on the Obama Care Plan! Opps! I just realized that has been tried before by the RSDLP (Russian Soviet Democratic Labor Party: Bolsheviks)!

I will tell you how we create jobs. The government needs to go after guitar makers, and we will start with the workers at Gibson! 

Well now Mr. Gibson, that is what you deserve for being a Huckabee supporter in the last election! Get on board the "corporatist" train my friend or get your knees broken! Mussolini is dead, so that Hugo Chavez sycophant, Eric Holder, must be running our economy now through our Department of Criminal Justice!

Gibson has government letters from both Madagascar and India saying the purchases were in order and legitimate. But the Justice Department said, "they interpret Indian law differently than the Indian government does!" What the hell? Well you conservative sap, that is what you get for not being a "green" company or employing union workers. Next thing you know you'll be moving your slave factory to S. Carolina! (parody; and I hope you basement dwellers know that. So no libs with thumbs-up please!)

Equal.  Share. Care. Fair.  America lets all do the right thing! Share what we have and not take from one another.  America needs revenue, lots and lots of revenue. Bailout the U.S. Postal service. They should not be forced to shut down and layoff thousands of hard working women and men. No way.

What happened to America? We dont share and sacrifice like we used to. We have gotten spoiled and greedy from eight years of Bush. I think its afwful when we dont sacrifice equally and fairly.  Poor people and middle class have no safety net. Rich and powerful (some Not all) people dont care about others as long as no one messes with their money. America has changed for the worst. We can turn that around if we all sacrifice together. Whats wrong with that?

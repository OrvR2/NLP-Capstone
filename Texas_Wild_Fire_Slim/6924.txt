CS police officer assaulted at Ziegfest


Tweet


















  
Eagle Staff Report
A  Bryan man was charged with evading arrest Sunday after police said he pushed a police officer to the ground while being kicked out of Zeigfest at Wolf Pen Creek Amphitheater. 
The arresting officer wrote in her report that she saw the man do a back flip into the moat surrounding the amphitheater's stage late Saturday night.
"The moat was only about a foot deep and this was an extremely dangerous act on his [part]," Sgt. Kathryn Reiter said. 
Reiter said she told the man he would have to leave and grabbed his arm to escort him out. The man then pushed her to the ground and tried to run away, Reiter said. 
"I tried to grab his legs as he kicked out of my grasp," she said. "The defendant was covered in slime from the moat and I couldn't get a hold of him."
The man attempted to run and jump the park's fence, but was tackled by another festival attendee, Reiter said.
He was escorted to jail and released early Sunday morning after posting $2,000 bail for the Class B misdemeanor charge, which carries a punishment of up to 180 days in jail and a $2,000 fine.

Israel arrests militants in death of British womanBy MATTI FRIEDMAN - Associated Press | AP – 14 hrs ago

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli security forces have arrested Hamas militants accused in a bombing that killed a British woman and wounded dozens of civilians earlier this year, the country's Shin Bet security service announced Wednesday.The announcement said the militant accused of constructing the bomb, a 36-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank, was arrested along with a 23-year-old Palestinian from Jerusalem accused of planting it next to a busy bus stop in the city on March 23.The bomb killed Mary Jean Gardner, a 59-year-old British tourist studying in Jerusalem, and injured two dozen others, including five Americans.The man accused of planting the bomb was in possession of a second explosive device intended for use by a suicide bomber in an attack planned for Aug. 21, according to the Shin Bet statement. The new bomb was seized a day before the planned attack and the would-be suicide bomber, a 20-year-old Palestinian from Hebron, was caught two days later.The statement said that in recent months the Shin Bet had arrested "dozens" of suspected militants who belonged to Hamas networks in Jerusalem and the West Bank and operated in coordination with Hamas leaders in Gaza and Syria. Thirteen were identified in the press release.A spokesman for the Hamas military wing in Gaza had no immediate comment.In the West Bank city of Hebron, Ali Kawasmeh, the father of Hussein Kawasmeh, accused of constructing the bomb, said his son was innocent and that Israel was "trying to punish his family." He said another son had died as a Hamas suicide bomber, two others had been killed by the military and five others were in Israeli prisons.The cities of the West Bank are governed by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority under Israel's overall security control.Hamas has ruled the Gaza Strip since seizing power there from the Palestinian Authority in 2007. Militants in the territory now possess rockets capable of striking across most of southern Israel.Late Wednesday, a militant from the Islamic Jihad faction was killed by an explosion in a car in central Gaza, according to a spokesman for the group, Abu Ahmad, and hospital officials in the town of Deir el-Balah. Another militant in the car was badly wounded.Islamic Jihad said the car was hit by an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military denied involvement.The Palestinian Authority, frustrated by prolonged deadlock in peace talks and capitalizing on international impatience with Israel's current hardline government, is moving ahead with a plan to seek recognition of a state at the United Nations later this month. The move is opposed by Israel and the U.S., who say a Palestinian state should be created through negotiations.On Wednesday, two senior White House envoys met with Palestinian officials and tried to persuade them to drop the plan and instead resume peace talks.A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose the information, said the American envoys did not raise new proposals that would enable talks to resume.In Washington, President Barack Obama's nominee for Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs told the Senate on Wednesday that the United States would veto a U.N. Security resolution recognizing a Palestinian state."A resolution at the United Nations is not really going to get us to the solution everybody is seeking," Wendy Sherman told the Foreign Relations Committee at her confirmation hearing."The administration has been very clear as well — and I don't expect this to occur, but that if it did occur, if any such resolution were put in front of the Security Council, that we would veto it. So our expectation is that will not occur."_____Associated Press Writer Nasser Shiyoukhi reported from Hebron, West Bank, Ibrahim Barzak from Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip and Bradley Klapper and Donna Cassata from Washington.

Salexpo,
Israel apologized for the USS Liberty and actual recordings of communications on the US & Israeli side make clear it was a mistake by Israel.  Israel felt horrible about it.  The Palestinians, on the other hand, name streets after their terrorists and celebrate deaths including the 9/11 attacks.  Israel is a civilized country.  The Palestinians are terrorists.  That's the difference.  Nice try.

Settlers Burn A Mosque Near Nablus


A group of extremist Israeli settlers broke, on Monday at dawn, into a mosque in Qasra village, near the northern West Bank city of Nablus, and torched it after destroying its property and writing anti-Arab slogans on its walls. 

Mosque Burnt By Settlers Near Ramallah

In related news, dozens of settlers hurled stones at Palestinian vehicles driving near the Yitzhar settlement, on the Nablus- Huwwara road; damage to several vehicles and a local bus was reported.

The settlers are carrying ongoing attacks against the Palestinians under the so-called “Price Tag”, as they blame the Palestinians for any Israeli evacuation of illegal settlement outposts.

On Monday at dawn, Israeli soldiers demolished three structures at the Migron illegal outpost, near the central West Bank city of Ramallah.

Earlier in June this year, settlers of the Alei Ayin illegal outpost torched a mosque in Al-Mughayyir village, near the central West Bank city of Ramallah, after burning tires and throwing them in the mosque causing serious damages.

Last year, the settlers burnt several copies of the Quran while desecrating two mosques near Bethlehem and Nablus.

Soldiers Attacking Villagers In Al Walaja

The soldiers, heavily deployed in the area, declared the village a “closed military zone”, and are preventing anybody from entering or leaving it.

Recently, the Israeli High Court authorized the army to resume the construction of the Wall on village lands in Al Walaja under the pretext that “the damage causing by the construction is relatively acceptable comparing to its security benefits”, according to the court.

Adel Al Atrash, deputy head of the Al Walaja Village Council, stated that the army uprooted, so far, more than 50 trees in the area.

Meanwhile the European Union stated that it is concerned about the serious humanitarian implications the Wall is having on the residents of Al Walaja.

On Monday at noon, settlers of the Beitar Illit illegal settlement, south west of Bethlehem, flooded with sewage water Palestinian olive orchards that belong to residents of Nahhalin village, near Bethlehem.

Osama Shakarna, head of the Nahhalin Village Council, stated that the settlers flooded more than 40 Dunams planted with more than 2500 Olive.

The sewage water reached Ein Fares natural spring used by the shepherd as the source of water for their herds.

Meanwhile, zioterrorists abroad call for reinforcements….

Yahoo!! People that blow up other people are not militants they are terrorists. Hamas is a terrorist organization. Like Osama Bin Ladin. Just because they did not kill tons of Americans   doesn't mean they aren't terrorists. FYI please send this memo to the UN as well as Turkey.

In related news, did you hear about the latest jewish spy to get caught selling out the US to Israel. Stewart Nozette or otherwise known as Yossi Fishman.Nozette was a jewish scientist who sold secrets to our good buddy Israel. 

He is just the latest in a long line of dual citizens who have betrayed the USA to Israel, yet strangely, the news media here in the US dont seem to want to cover the story.

when will Israel the people that did this? In 1954 the Israelis attacked US and British buildings with bombs ,,, On 8 June 1967 the Israelis over a period of six hours repeatedly bombed and strafed the American ship the USS Liberty killing 34 US sailors. They even fired at survivors in their life boats.

Guy Ritchie has become a father for a second time on Monday morning as he welcomed a new life together with 29-year-old model girlfriend Jacqui Ainsley. The as-of-yet-unnamed baby boy, delivered via Caesarean section according to the Daily Mail, will be the half-brother to boys Rocco and David from the "Sherlock Holmes" director's previous, and much-paparazzi'd marriage to Madonna, which ended in 2008.

				Perhaps I am having a problem comprehend­ing this article, as I believed Guy Ritchie only had one son with Madonna, then I remembered that Madonna did adopt a son, so, is this saying "second time father," meaning in two different relationsh­ips, or that Rocco & David are his and his girlfriend­'s sons?   Truly, either I am too tired, or this is written poorly?   Either way, Guy Ritchie became a father again, to another son!   So perhaps they could've said a father for the fourth time, or is his ties with his stepdaught­er Allordous severed?

				Apparently­, he and Madonna filed for adoption together as a couple. And it was finalized before the divorce (though perhaps after the separation­). So David is also his (adopted) son.

				Rocco, I believe is Guy Ritchie's and Madonna's son and now he's a father for the second time to another"un­named baby boy!  He's the stepfather to Alordous(M­adonna's daughter).  From what I am reading, David is Guy's son's mother's from a previous relationsh­ip, hence the "unnamed boy is the stepbrothe­r to Rocco & David!"  Congratula­tions and God Bless all with good health, happiness and all the best always.

				Madonna's daughter is named LOURDES (Alordous?­) - nickname Lola.  She is Guy's former step-daugh­ter.  His bio child with Madonna is Rocco. David is the Mulawi boy that he and Madonna adopted just before the divorce.  So this new baby is really his second bio child.

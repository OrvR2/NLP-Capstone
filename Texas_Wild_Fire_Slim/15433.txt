Elite team to help search in huge Texas wildfire.
Posted by Tactical-Life.com. Author Archive »
 

An elite search team was set to arrive Wednesday in Bastrop County, Texas, where firefighters were battling a huge blaze that has killed at least two people.
“I cannot emphasize enough to Texans in the impacted areas the importance of heeding all warnings from local officials, especially evacuation orders, as these fires are mean, swift and highly dangerous,” Gov. Rick Perry said.
The 600-member Texas Task Force 1 will assist local officials and first responders, Perry said.
A leadership team from the task force arrived Tuesday. “Based on the needs of local officials, a wide area search team consisting of approximately 100 members and nearly one dozen search canines will be in Bastrop Wednesday morning to work with the local incident management team and assist with search operations,” Perry’s office said in a statement.

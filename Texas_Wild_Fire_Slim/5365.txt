Ex-Saudi spy chief: after UBL killing, U.S. should have declared victoryBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – 10 hrs ago

Afghan Pres. Hamid Karzai and Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal at Davos in 2006. (Michel  …Former Saudi spy chief Prince Turki al-Faisal, speaking at Washington think tank Wednesday, said after the killing of Osama bin Laden in May, the United States should have declared victory in Afghanistan and gone home.
"Killing bin Laden would have been the perfect moment for your   president to say, 'We've done it, we are victorious, this is the   timetable that we've set for withdrawal of troops and goodbye and good   luck,' " Turki said Wednesday, at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Washington Post's Craig Whitlock reported. "This would be the perfect moment to leave with a   victory and not to go on and sort of continue in this endless mission   of strike and counterstrike."
"I don't mean withdrawing your embassy, your economic aid or your   other support, but having troops on the ground in Afghanistan has never   succeeded," he added.
The nephew of Saudi King Abdullah, Prince Turki served as Riyadh's envoy to the UK and Washington during the administration of George W. Bush. In the 1980s, he served as a key Saudi contact with the CIA-backed mujahadeen fighting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Among those also supporting their fight was bin Laden, with whom Turki met, as Whitlock recounts.
"He also met bin Laden several times in Afghanistan and Pakistan, before  the Saudi native had his citizenship stripped by the kingdom for his  terrorist activities," Whitlock writes. "In 1998, Turki traveled to Kandahar to persuade  Taliban leader Mullah Omar to hand over bin Laden after al-Qaeda bombed  U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He was unsuccessful."
Turki resigned as Riyadh's intelligence chief after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, when investigators learned that 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi. "That event weighs heavily on my shoulders as a Saudi," he said.

... take a look around, pal. I got news for you! America didn't win. We lost. Miserably so. Our national wealth squandered, on the Pentagon's wet dream: Iraq, Afghanistan, plus our three secret wars, Yeman, Pakistan and Libya, makes five wars going simultaneously, no end in sight. Ripped off by Wall Street money changers, a cool 17 trillion, left holding the bag on a crumbling infrastrusture, a penniless dollar, and that sucking sound, 20 million jobs, poof-gone. Forever. America's best days well behind her, those jobs are never coming back. And, you think you're going to stand on my doorstep, a tell me, "Mission Accomplished?" Oh, I tell you what, pal. How about I grab you by the scruff, drag you out to the kerb, put my steel-toed boot to the side of your face -- make you lap up some gutter-water, like to dog you are?  -- QED, asj.

The former Saudi spy chief is right, and the fact is the U.S. could still use the death of Bin Laden as a pretext to exit Afganistan in victory. It might seem a hollow victory, because Afganistan is a mess, but at least American soldiers could come home.

Rich list shows China wealth unhurt by global turmoilBy Bill Savadove | AFP – Thu, 8 Sep, 2011

The financial turmoil gripping the world has had little effect on wealth in China, where an ongoing economic boom keeps creating new US dollar billionaires, Forbes magazine said Thursday.
Releasing its annual list of China's richest people, Forbes said the world's second largest economy had a total of 146 billionaires this year -- up 14 percent from 2010, and second only to the United States that has 413.
Like a similar list released Wednesday by the China-based Hurun report -- which publishes luxury magazines and runs a research institute -- Forbes crowned machinery tycoon Liang Wengen the nation's richest man.
"Even though the stock market is going down, the wealth of the most successful people in China is going up," Russell Flannery, Forbes senior editor and Shanghai bureau chief, told reporters.
He pointed to a domestic building spree, higher demand for consumer goods and an economic boom as driving the increase in wealth in China, which posted growth of 9.6 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2011.
"The high GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate simply gives a big platform and a lot of room for people to find new businesses," he said.
Liang, chairman and co-founder of machinery company Sany, topped the Forbes list with wealth of $9.3 billion. The Hurun report estimated his wealth at $11 billion.
The construction tycoon moved to the number one spot from third last year, as China's building spree created demand for Sany's cranes and excavators.
A total of seven executives from the machinery firm were on this year's list -- a record number for one single company, according to Forbes.
Xiang Wenbo, president of Sany, who came in 79th place, told reporters he did not feel like a "winner."
"Sany is an industrial company focused on real business, so we don't think it is such a big deal," he said.
In second place on the list was Robin Li, co-founder of China's top Internet search engine Baidu, with wealth of $9.2 billion.
Baidu has reaped gains from the partial exit from China of rival Google, after the US Internet giant clashed with Beijing over censorship last year.
Two brothers took third and fourth place -- Liu Yongxing of East Hope Group, China's largest animal feed producer, and his younger brother Liu Yonghao, whose company New Hope Group has interests ranging from feed to finance.
Beverage magnate Zong Qinghou of soft-drink maker Wahaha fell to fifth place this year from first in 2010.
The total wealth of the 400 people on the list was $459 billion this year, up from around $423 billion in 2010, Forbes said.
Among the 146 billionaires on the list, 12 are female and eight are under the age of 40. China's richest woman is Wu Yajun of property developer Longfor, who came in at seventh place.

North America you have to increase the promotion and sales of your products to other countries in Europe, Africa etc. By so doing, you can increase more jobs and your economy instead of blaming anyone. If you are interested to market your products to Africa you can contact me jonh3545@gmail.com

Stop the bleeding. No more buying products from a country that has no regulation and no accountability. We can't compete in that field or with the wages they pay.

Keep the rich people out of Canada there's only one way you become a billionaire and that's on the backs of thousands of people used until that are sick or dying. notice many are foreigners and that's because the rules are corrupt in there counties, so keep the foreigners out as well, 99% of crime in Canada is from people not born here or first generations garbage! even the so called upstanding ones are criminals.

Chinas richness is the cause of America, and Canada. They should remember what is given can be taken away. So I don’t want to hear about china’s wealth, because it’s not of there own doing, keep bragging and see what will happen, appreciate it while it last’s...

I've lived in China for five years now.  From my experience there is no middle class.  You are either well off and living in a nice apartment or living in the ghetto (which I did for a year).  The funny thing is that only the very rich can afford to buy a house, car, and luxury goods.  For the average Chinese worker (blue collar or otherwise) there is no possibility that they can afford these things.  Most Chinese wake up, go to work, make there $10 a day, then go home.  They save there whole lives with the hope that maybe (big maybe) that their kids will be able to buy an apartment.  To bad that in China any property you buy goes back to the government after 70 years.  :(

I'd like to see the nation with the biggest and healthiest middle class. Most billionaires and most dirty and poorest people at the bottom end doesn't impress me much, especially a terrible human rights record. But what do i know, people like to suck up to the rich , so suck up.

If you Americans want someone to blame then look at Reagan. It was him who started to export jobs over seas. It has become part of the Republicans mandate. 

Just how long did you think you could keep doing this without affecting jobs?

Now you blame Obama for everything.   

You people are just plain stupid.

This is change. North America won't like it, but it won't change. This is globalization. Our governments agreed to pursue it years ago because the corporations pushed for it.

What it means is that imports from poor countries don't get high tax rates, so the corporations profit most when sending work to those countries.

If their minimum wage is $1/hr, and ours is $10/hr, where would you send the work?

 The concept of globalization is that the minimum wages across the world will even out, to say $4/hr. Poor countries wwwwill go up while our goes down...substantially.

Of course, developed nations aren't going to allow their minimum wage to decrease. The only way to do this is to allow the economy to bankrupt and start over with a new, global currency.

The corporations and political leaders are well aware of this. Obama, Bush,Clinton, Apple, GM, everyone. The only way out is temporary; go to poor/developing nations and use your skills to get into their economy while it's still young. Our leaders will keep giving us the propaganda that things will get better, knowing full well that they won't.

Canada and USA have no future because we can't compete with slave labour. Get out while you can.

Heather Donahue 
A lot of our entertainment throws into detail the stagnation and illness of how we live today-it's sad and it's sick... and it's profitable.





George Berkeley 
A mind at liberty to reflect on its own observations, if it produce nothing useful to the world, seldom fails of entertainment to itself.





Tina Yothers 
Acting is definitely put at the back of my mind, if it's there at all right now. It's all entertainment.





Michael Berryman 
Actually, one of the TSA guys showed me the Entertainment Weekly with the poster from the original in it, which also mentioned they were doing a remake. Caught me totally by surprise.





George Thorogood
All I have is my performance, I try to feed in the best of everything that I could possibly do into those 90 minutes and to make a live entertainment show out of it.

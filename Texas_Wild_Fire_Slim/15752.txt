Shutdown Corner 
Mon Sep 12 09:53am EDT
Video: Horse collar flag picked up because player was hair-tackled By      Chris Chase


Vince Lombardi liked to say that there were only two things in football: blocking and tackling. The tackling he spoke of involved hitting players low, wrapping up and driving opponents into the ground. He probably never could have imagined having to teach the modern day tactic of "yank that dude down by his hair."
Another reminder of the legality of hair-pulling (it's been allowed for the past few seasons) was given in Sunday's Week 1 game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans. At the end of the first half, Titans kicker Rob Bironas(notes) attempted an NFL-record 66-yard field goal. It landed short, was caught in the end zone by Jacksonville's Rashean Mathis(notes), who attempted to return the ball for a touchdown. Mathis didn't get far, as he was corralled by Nate Washington(notes).
A flag came out on the play because an official thought Washington's tackle was of the illegal horse-collar variety. Or was it?

OK, but what if Rasheen Mathis or any NFL player got a weave made of horse hair? Would it technically then be considered a horse collar?

3 users disliked this comment Mark W 12 minutes ago Report Abuse Good!    I'm glad hair-tackling is legal.    Looks like a bunch of freakin girls out there on the field, (mostly worn that way by blacks, i might add, and I don't give a @#$% if it is "culture", you're in America.    If you want to practice your "culture" go back to where you came from).    Maybe it will convince these idiots to get a haircut.    I have a very rough time believing these people are college-educated.    Look like men out there.    If you want to grow your hair long, then join the cheerleaders on the sidelines and leave the game to the real men!

1 users disliked this comment William 59 minutes ago Report Abuse Long hair,tight pants,slapping each other on the butt,commercial endorsements for hair shampoo,thousand dollar clothes,more bling then a good pawn shop,crying and acting like a baby when you don't get the quarterback to give you the ball,crying because you are not paid enough money to play football or payed alot and then not having the brains to invest any,what are we going to see next a penalty for pulling hair,
I have to wonder if it is real men playing the game of football or just a bunch of spoiled prima Donna's and personally i think professional football has gone downhill in the last five to ten years,i just do not see a good basic hard hitting football game on tv anymore as it is just more of a show anymore,hell look at loser romo after each screw-up he just smiled as if not a care in the world.
Professional football and long hair is just what it is a sport gone to the girls

Vanity is a horrible excuse for falling short of your full potential in a very brief, multi-million dollar job that only 3000 people in the world are able to do. Get rid of the hair, guys.

5 users disliked this comment BallerBaby1 2 hours ago Report Abuse Locs does not make you: 
~dirty                   ~greasy
~stupid               ~uneducated
~idiot                   ~a sissy
~ghetto             ~whatever other thing the idiots on here have been saying.

This isn't anything new. I didn't see the man come one tv and cry about it. They know its the rule and if they didn't like it im sure they wouldve cut their hair a long time ago. Having locs doesn't make you anymore dirty or intelligent than hawk or matthews. Some may say its a grooming issue, then that means every woman and man with hair on their head has a grooming issue. I find those huge bushy beards around their face that are like 6 inches + to be less appropriate and cleanly but nobody demands they cut those. 

These comments show that people are more retarded and prejudiced (doesn't mean racist for the idiots out there) than I orignally thought, but nothing surprises me anymore these days. I mean   if they wanted a haircut they wouldn't have went through the long tedious process of growing and maintaining their locs... right? I mean if you want a pair of black slacks why would you go out and buy some jean shorts instead? They want what they got and got what they want.I mean don't you think after about 3-4 years of growing those locs to that length they would cut them off if they felt it was hendering them? I mean they don't just pop up at that length overnight.

I noticed that all the posts that weren't about bad mouthing locs and trying to be logical received the lowest scores and their comments are not shown. People have more of a problem with people having locs than ben going around raping women... shame.

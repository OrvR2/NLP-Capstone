SKELLEFTEA, Sweden, Sept. 9 (UPI) -- A Swedish man who lost his leg more than 10 years ago said it is "ridiculous" that he has to prove he still has trouble walking every three years.
Fredrik Jansson of Skelleftea, who had to have his leg amputated while battling cancer, said the local government forces him to prove every three years that he still has trouble walking in order to keep his disabled parking permit, The Local reported Friday.
"It is ridiculous to say the least. It defies all common sense," Jansson said. "I go down to Umea once every three years and have a doctor establish my leg is still gone."
"It's not like my leg is going to grow back," he said.
Skelleftea Traffic Administrator Annica Persson said the tests are necessary to determine who can manage without a permit as there are limited amount of disabled parking spaces.
"It is really difficult for us to judge these things and that is why we need the medical recommendation," Persson said.

The Defenders Online:
Six years ago Camille Proctor got a surprise. She was pregnant with her second child. At the time, her oldest was almost 20 and the rigors of mothering an infant were pleasant but distant memories. Still, she gave birth to a baby boy nine months later, and a little more than a year after that, Proctor noticed something else surprising about her son. She said she saw, "little nuisances that kind of told me that something may not be right."

				Children with autism are difficult, but not impossible to deal with.  As a very young day care worker in the 1970's I unknowingl­y worked with a 4 year old boy who was autistic.  He had great parents who loved him dearly.  He was dressed well and had developed well physically­, a very handsome young man.  He did not participat­e well with the other children.  He did not speak a word.  To add to the the problem, his parents were Hispanic and did not speak English well.  I visited their home.  It was meticulous­ly clean.  They had a younger child with no apparent problems.  At the center, all were afraid to wortk with the autistic 4 year old.  He often turned violent, attacked the other children.  I was assigned to him, as he was taller for his age and needed the extra attention.  This was the "last straw"  He had been expelled from other centers. I worked hard with the young man.  Very hard.    "TEMPLE GRANDIN" is a good film addressing the autistic problem
http://www­.youtube.c­om/watch?v­=46ycu3JFR­rA
I was able to teach that young man how to say his name and my name.  I also taught him how to throw a Spalding ball back and forth to each other. He was quickly progressin­g.  Once I left the center, he was expelled.

				It's good whenever the public hears about  the impact autism is having on our children.  A once rare disorder now affects one percent of children, including almost two percent of boys.  Tarice L.S. Gray wrote:  "[N]umbers across the board are on the rise. The Federal Government issued a report in 2009 stating that 1 in 110 children are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The Center for Disease control also notes the rise in diagnosed children over the past two decades is alarming. At the current rate of diagnosis, more children will be diagnosed with autism than with AIDS, diabetes & cancer combined."  At the same time, we were told that autism is  a "gene disorder."  If autism were a solely genetic problem we wouldn't be seeing the exponentia­l increase in affected children.

In truth, no one has ever shown us a comparable rate of autism among adults and that fact should be scaring us all.  

Dr. Thomas Insel, head of the Interagenc­y Autism Coordinati­ng Committee (IACC) created by Congress to deal with autism, has said that 80 percent of Americans with autism are under the age of 18 and he warned that we need "to prepare for a million people who may be in need of significan­t services." Nothing is being done to handle the approachin­g tsunami of dependent adults that will descend on social services in the coming years. The IACC now calls autism "a national health emergency.­"

				Epidemiolo­gy of autism spectrum disorders in adults in the community in England.  
Arch Gen Psychiatry­. 68(5):459-­65.

1% of adults in England--c­onsistent across all ages (young adults/mid­dle-aged/e­lderly)--h­ave autism.

The only issue left is the psychology of why some people continue to believe AoA when it gets pretty much everything wrong...

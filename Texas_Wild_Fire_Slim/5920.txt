				This list was silly, but if a waitress ever told me to save room for dessert, I would in fact be turned off by the place.  A real restaurant does not push dessert.  The dinner should stand on its own merits.  An immediate giveaway that fat suburbanit­es go there, who obsess over the desserts at such places, and describe them the next day to the women at work.

				Having been a chef for over 30 years and working in several different restaurant­s, this list was really lame.

The best way to know if a restaurant is good is done by 1 thing only: the staff would bring their mother their to eat.

				That was a pretty terrible list.  Let me recap:1. If the restaurant offers fruit flavored martinis then they are clearly a bad restaurant and you should run fast.2. If the server tries to make an extra buck by getting you to order dessert, then get out.3. If a restaurant offers a dessert it didn't invent, then it is a hole and you should back out now before it's too late.4. An night club may not have food on par with a dedicated restaurant­. - Captain Obvious5. If someone on the street, hired to advertise for the restaurant­, tells you it's good, he may be lying. -Captain Obvious

				If you don't already know if the restaurant is good or bad before it's time to consider dessert you probably won't ever know the difference­.

				Servers are pushed into upping the check by suggesting extra apps, drinks, and even a dessert. Managers' bonuses depend on high sales, and pushing things like desserts ups those sales.

Don't blame the server. Blame the corporatio­n.

				Of  course.  The issue I have with this is that just because a server suggests saving room for dessert, it doesn't mean the restaurant is terrible.  In fact, none of these mean the restaurant is terrible, yet that's what the author is implying.

				That's just it.  Any restaurant with that attitude is no good, in my mind.  I can't stand waitresses talking right off of a corporate script.  

That's one reason I don't patronize chain or corporate restaurant­s.

Look Out Democrats, 2012 Is Looking Like 2010
That could be bad news in the Senate: Nate Silver

(Newser) -
                                    It can be dangerous to draw broad conclusions from special elections, but  last night's results  from New York and Nevada make it safe to say that "the special election scorecard is starting to look pretty ominous for Democrats," writes Nate Silver at the  New York Times . Coming...

GOP Wins Weiner's Seat
Bob Turner wins NYC seat in major upset

(Newser) -
                                    The special election to replace Rep. Anthony Weiner was widely seen as a referendum on President Obama's economic policy—and the resounding answer was: "No." Republican political novice Bob Turner soundly defeated Democratic state Assemblyman David Weprin,  AP  reports. It's the first time a Republican has...

In Nasty Fight, Weiner's Seat May Go to GOP
Republican leads Democrat by 6 points

(Newser) -
                                    Not only did Anthony Weiner lose his own seat, he might have lost it for his party—in a very Democratic district, no less. Republican Bob Turner leads Democrat David Weprin by 47% to 41%, with 7% still undecided,  Public Policy Polling  finds. Turner’s got a 32-point lead among...

Dem Wins NY Election in Upset
Medicare debate boosts Kathy Hochul to victory

(Newser) -
                                    Democrat Kathy Hochul has scored an upset win in one of New York state's most conservative congressional districts. Republican Jane Corwin had been expected to easily win the special election in the state's 26th district but her support ebbed away after she expressed support for the GOP's...

Miami-Dade Mayor Ousted
Carlos Alvarez recalled by huge margin

(Newser) -
                                    An overwhelming majority of voters in Miami-Dade county have decided to chuck their mayor out of office before the end of his term. Almost 90% of voters chose to oust Carlos Alvarez in the biggest recall of a local politician in American history, the  Miami Herald  reports. Alvarez, a Republican,...

Election for Byrd's Seat? Maybe Not
Ambiguity in West Virginia law leave

(Newser) -
                                    Robert Byrd’s Senate seat is up for grabs, but it’s unclear when the public will get to decide who fills it. For now, Gov. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, will appoint an interim successor. But then things get interesting. At first glance, we’re headed for a November showdown:...

GOP Wins House Seat in Obama's Hometown
Fractured Dems confident they can retake seat in November

(AP) -
                                    A Honolulu city councilman has defeated two Democrats to give Republicans a midterm election victory in the US congressional district where President Obama grew up. Charles Djou's win yesterday is the latest triumph for the GOP as it looks to take back control of Congress. And it came as a...

What to Watch in Today's 4 Primaries
Pennsylvania, Arizona, Kentucky offer intrigue

(Newser) -
                                    Four states go to the polls today, and the results will have huge implications.  Politico  breaks down what to watch for in each race, and we, as always, provide the cliff notes:  Pennsylvania:  Arlen Specter—the longest serving senator in state history—is in real danger of losing a primary ...

Bad News for Dems: Murtha Seat Now a 'Toss-Up'
Party faces yet another battleground

(Newser) -
                                    John Murtha’s death has left Democrats with another fight on their hands. Last night the Cook Political Report changed its rating of the race to “toss-up,” one of 50 Democratic-held seats bearing that rating. Voting isn’t far off either; Ed Rendell has 10 days to schedule...

Romneycare Did In Obamacare
Mass. already has even-more-liberal health plan—why aid others?

(Newser) -
                                    Mitt Romney didn’t help Scott Brown win by campaigning for him, Timothy Noah writes, but by giving Massachusetts universal health care four years ago. Sure, the senator-elect and the former governor railed against Obamacare as a “one size fits all” health reform plan, but they were being disingenuous....

Scott Brown Posed Nude for Cosmo
Mass. Senate candidate named 'Sexiest Man' in 1982

(Newser) -
                                    Long before he became the man just one election away from scuttling health care reform, Scott Brown was just a 22-year-old law student at Boston College. It was there, during finals week, that  Cosmopolitan  found him and named him "America's Sexiest Man" in its June 1982 issue. At the...

Obama Stumps for Coakley; Brown Up by 5 Points
Scott Brown surges in furious finish to Mass. Senate race

(Newser) -
                                    President Obama stumped hard for Martha Coakley yesterday, making the case that the Massachusetts special election for Ted Kennedy's Senate seat represents a final hurdle for health care reform. "Understand what's at stake here: It's whether we're going forward or going backward," Obama told a crowd of 1,...

Obama Will Visit Mass., Stump for Coakley
White House pulls out the stops in Mass. special election

(Newser) -
                                    President Obama will campaign for Martha Coakley Sunday in hopes of bolstering her bid for the late Ted Kennedy's Senate seat. The White House initially shied away from getting Obama involved in the Massachusetts special election, which is widely considered a referendum on his tenure. But the latest polls show...

Obama Turns Up Heat in Mass. Senate Race
New video urges support for Coakley, president's agenda

(Newser) -
                                    With less than a week to go before the special election for Ted Kennedy's Senate seat and Democratic nominee Martha Coakley slipping in the polls, President Obama is appealing directly to voters. In a video released today, Obama ties his agenda to Coakley's prospects, saying the Massachusetts AG will "...

(Newser) -
                                    Scott Brown says he raised more than $1.3 million in just 24 hours as part of his bid to wrest Ted Kennedy’s Senate seat from Democrats' hands in next week’s special election. Brown enticed 16,000 donors to toss money to him online during the so-called "...

Mass. Senate Race Becomes Referendum on Health Bill
Candidates to succeed Kennedy cast selves as deciding vote

(AP) -
                                    The race to succeed the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy has turned into a proxy battle over the fate of President Obama's health care overhaul. The contest between Democrat Martha Coakley and Republican Scott Brown has coarsened with a week to go, as the two have cast themselves as custodians...

GOP Won't Win Kennedy Seat—But It'll Be Close
Loss of 'Bush shield' will rattle Dems

(Newser) -
                                    The Republicans won't be able to pull off a stunning upset in the Massachusetts special election for Ted Kennedy's Senate seat, but it'll be close enough to scare Democrats, predicts Steve Kornacki. State attorney General Martha Coakley should be able to muster enough resources to narrowly fend off challenger Scott...

Dems Should Worry About Kennedy Seat
Democrat Coakley will probably win, but it's not a given

(Newser) -
                                    A new  Rasmussen poll  says the special election to fill Ted Kennedy's Senate seat is surprisingly close: It has Democrat Martha Coakley leading Republican Scott Brown 50-41 ahead of the Jan. 19 vote. Nate Silver thinks the poll is flawed and figures Coakley's lead is probably closer to 15 points....

Coakley Leads Fight to Fill Kennedy's Shoes
Four vie for Democratic nomination, with AG out front

(Newser) -
                                    Massachusetts voters probably won’t let whoever takes Ted Kennedy’s seat be too far removed from the late senator’s ideals, but being too close appears to be a hindrance. With less than a week to go until the Democratic primary that will likely decide the January special election,...

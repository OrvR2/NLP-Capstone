SAN FRANCISCO (KCBS) – Security at the Golden Gate Bridge has undergone many changes since the September 11th terrorist attacks ten years ago. Since 2001, $15 million worth of security enhancements have been implemented at the Golden Gate Bridge, but spokeswoman Mary Currie says the Bridge District depends on more than just police agencies to keep the iconic span safe.
“It’s not only the boots on the ground if you will, with the law enforcement folks, but it’s also the general public that we really do rely on as well as a component to the security here at the bridge, to tell us if they see something out of the ordinary,” said Currie.

Currie adds that security has been evolving since the bridge opened in 1937, and that the Bridge District has changed security in response to events other than just 9/11, including World War II and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
“Whatever the climate is, we are ebbing and flowing with what needs to be done to preserve public safety on the bridge and around the bridge,” said Currie.

The California Highway Patrol, San Francisco Police Department, Sausalito Police and Fire Departments, Coast Guard, US Park Police, Golden Gate National Recreation Area and Bridge staff all form a security coalition for the span that meets regularly.

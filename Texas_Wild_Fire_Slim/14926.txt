IFAB agrees to re-examine goal-line technology


Tweet
TweetThe International Football Association Board (IFAB) convened for its Annual Business Meeting (ABM) today, Wednesday 20 October 2010, at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales.
During the meeting, the IFAB agreed to re-open the discussions concerning goal-line technology. In this regard, the members of the IFAB agreed on the following principles:
- The technology would apply solely to the goal line, and only to determine whether a goal has been scored or not;- The system must be accurate;- The indication of whether a goal has been scored must be immediate and automatically confirmed within one second;- The indication of whether a goal has been scored will only be communicated to the match officials.
A deadline of the end of November 2010 was set for companies to initially present their technologies to FIFA. A proposed testing period will then take place with a selected number of companies, prior to the IFAB Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 4-6 March 2011, when the next steps of the process will be determined.
The IFAB also heard an update on the eight additional assistant referees experiment that was approved at the IFAB Special Meeting in July 2010. Ongoing experiments are currently being conducted by UEFA, the French Football Association, the Moroccan Football Association and the Qatar Football Association. Further experiments will commence in other competitions in 2011 in Côte d’Ivoire, Mexico and Brazil. One experiment within the AFC President’s Cup has already been concluded. The experiment phase will continue until the conclusion of the 2011/2012 season.
The wording of the existing Laws of the Game was also reviewed for proposed amendment at the AGM.
The 125th IFAB Annual General Meeting will take place at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales on 4-6 March 2011.

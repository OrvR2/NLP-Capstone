Brazos County may approve reduced tax rate


Tweet

For the second week in a row, the Brazos County Commissioners Court didn't hear from any residents Tuesday during a public hearing regarding the proposed 2011 tax rate.
Recently, the Commissioners Court proposed a tax rate of 48.5 cents per $100 property valuation, which is slightly lower than the 48.65 cent rate adopted in 2010. 
The commissioners will reconvene next week to vote on the proposal, at which point residents will have a final opportunity to express opinions. 
Officials said they were able to recommend a lower tax rate while still increasing tax revenue for the 2011 budget because of new development in Brazos County. 
Another contributing factor was a slight increase in the appraisal value of Brazos County homes, said Kristeen Roe, Brazos County tax collector.
If the rate is adopted, about $51.6 million will be generated in tax revenue for the county, an increase of about 3 percent from 2010, when just more than $49.9 million was collected. 
If adopted and applied to the average county home value of $176,777, the taxes owed under the rate would be $854.46, officials said. 
Last year, the average homeowner paid $826.63, according to county officials.
The tax rate adoption meeting will be held at 4 p.m. Tuesday in the Commissioners' Courtroom inside the County Administration Building, which is located at 200 S. Texas Ave.

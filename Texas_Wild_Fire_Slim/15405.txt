SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — When the dust settles from Google Inc.’s proposed deal to buy Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., it’s feasible that Microsoft Corp. might end up becoming one of the biggest beneficiaries of this $12.5 billion acquisition.

						Google’s $12.5 billion deal for Motorola Mobility would give it access to Motorola’s rich patent portfolio. Shira Ovide has details.
					

Of course, this theory depends on how Google

 integrates Motorola Mobility 
/quotes/zigman/3019788/quotes/nls/mmi MMI+55.78%
 into its business. It also depends on how much Google stays true to its words delivered on Monday, in which it practically swore an oath that it intends to keep the Android platform open and that the main driver of the deal was to get access to Motorola’s fat portfolio of wireless patents — which would presumably benefit all companies in the Android market.

But at least some believe that the preferential treatment Motorola has already received from Google may continue, in terms of getting early access to Android software updates. And that may give other makers of Android handsets some pause. 

“This would place other hardware vendors at a disadvantage and may lead them to question their commitment to the platform, potentially pushing them towards other platforms,” said Ovum analyst Nick Dillon, in a note on Monday, who mentioned specifically that Microsoft’s

Windows Phone platform would be the most obvious beneficiary.

Few believe that Google is trying to create an Apple Inc.				
/quotes/zigman/68270/quotes/nls/aapl AAPL+1.70%
-like ecosystem, where the company’s hardware and software development are tied at the hip. 

But even a small amount of perceived advantage to Motorola could swing critical momentum away from Android — and towards Microsoft. Motorola was the only major Android handset maker that does not also develop devices for Windows Phone.

“The deal will make most Android players realize how dependent they are on Google and how quickly Google’s plans can change their business,” said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst with IDC, in an email. “This acquisition may be the catalyst for companies to reduce their dependence on Google’s platform to face future market challenges.”

Walter Pritchard of Citigroup notes, however, that if Google can keep Motorola separate and use its vast patent portfolio to protect and ensure that other smartphone developers are “not exposed to intellectual property risk,” then Google’s deal “could significantly bolster Android’s position.”

He said though, that if Google ends up pursuing more of an Apple-like strategy, “then Windows Phone becomes a more attractive alternative for these partners.” Microsoft will surely be touting that potential, and its status as an independent operating system, to its partners.

Google could also develop special features in Android for Motorola phones exclusively, to make them more attractive in the crowded market.

Mike Abramsky of RBC Capital Markets noted that the deal could also push the other vendors to look at developing alternative software plans.

“The deal may create significant disruption amongst existing Android OEMs (Samsung, HTC, etc) who now may view Google as a competitor as well as partner, possibly forcing some to embrace Microsoft — or further other/their own software strategies,” Abramsky said in a note.

With Google’s deal, Microsoft could possibly be in an even better position to successfully fight for the No. 3 position in the smartphone market, versus Research In Motion Ltd.

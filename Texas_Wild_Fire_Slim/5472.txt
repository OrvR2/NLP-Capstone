NEW DELHI — A briefcase bomb tore through a crowd of people waiting to enter a New Delhi courthouse, killing 11 people and wounding scores more Wednesday in the deadliest terrorist attack in India's capital in nearly three years.
An al-Qaida-linked group claimed responsibility, though government officials said it was too early to name a suspect. The attack outside the High Court came despite a high alert across the city and renewed doubts about India's ability to protect even its most important institutions despite overhauling security after the 2008 Mumbai siege.
"Have we become so vulnerable that terrorist groups can almost strike at will?" opposition lawmaker Arun Jaitley asked in Parliament.
The bomb left a deep crater on the road and shook the courthouse, sending lawyers and judges fleeing outside.
"There was smoke everywhere. People were running. People were shouting. There was blood everywhere. It was very, very scary," said lawyer Sangeeta Sondhi, who was parking her car near the gate when the bomb exploded.
The government rallied Indians to remain strong in the face of such attacks.
"We will never succumb to the pressure of terrorists," Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said during a visit to neighboring Bangladesh. "This is a long war in which all political parties and all the people of India will have to stand united so that this scourge of terrorism is crushed."
The bomb exploded about 10:14 a.m. near a line of more than 100 people waiting at a reception counter for passes to enter the court building to have their cases heard. The blast killed 11 people and wounded 76 others. Their identities were not available, but no judges were among the victims.
People ran to assist the injured, piling them into three-wheeled taxis to take them to the hospital. Ambulances and forensic teams rushed to the scene, along with sniffer dogs and a bomb disposal unit, apparently checking for any further explosives.
Renu Sehgal, a 42-year-old housewife with a case before the court, had just received her pass and was standing nearby with her uncle and mother while her husband parked their car when she heard the explosion.
"The sound was so huge and suddenly people started running," she said. "We were all in such a big panic. ... I'm lucky I survived."
The court building was evacuated after the attack.
The blast probe was quickly turned over to the National Investigation Agency, established after the Mumbai siege to investigate and prevent terror attacks.
Police were scouring the city for possible suspects, searching hotels, bus stands, railway stations and the airport, said top security official U.K. Bansal. All roads out of the city were under surveillance as well, he said.
Late Wednesday, police also released two sketches they said were based on descriptions given by eyewitnesses who claimed they had seen someone with a briefcase waiting in line outside the building.
"We are determined to track down the perpetrators of this horrific crime and bring them to justice," Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told Parliament.
An email sent to several TV news channels claimed the bombing on behalf of Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, an extremist group said to be based in Pakistan. The group has been blamed for numerous terror strikes in India, and the U.S. State Department says it has deep ties to al-Qaida and some members have trained at al-Qaida camps.
The email demanded the immediate repeal of the death sentence handed to Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri man convicted in the 2001 attack on India's Parliament, and threatened to target other courts, including the Supreme Court.
"We cannot say anything about the email until we have investigated it thoroughly," NIA chief S.C. Sinha said. "At this point the investigation is fully open and it's not possible to name any group."
The court bombing was India's first major attack since a trio of blasts in Mumbai killed 26 people on July 13. Suspicion fell on the shadowy Indian Mujahedeen, though no one has been arrested.
The bomb struck the High Court, an appeals panel below India's Supreme Court, even though the capital is on high alert because Parliament is in session. A small explosion on May 25 in a court parking lot appeared to have been a failed car bomb.
After the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the government expanded police recruiting and training, set up the NIA and established commando bases across the country so forces could react swiftly.
Jaitley, in Parliament, said the court bombing raised "deep concern" about "the kind of institutions and systems we have to build to fight this menace."
But officials say the number of targets in a nation of 1.2 billion makes it impossible to provide full security.
Dharmendra Kumar, a senior police officer, told reporters the court building itself was strongly protected by police but the explosion hit a busy main road outside.
K.P.S. Gill, a former senior police official, said Kumar's comment showed the police had a "ridiculous mindset" and India needed to rethink its strategy on preventing terror.
"If the public collects there, then you must protect that area," Gill said.
The attack rekindled memories of the string of deadly bombings that rocked the country in 2008, including a series of coordinated bomb blasts in New Delhi on Sept. 13 that killed 21 people. Many of those attacks were blamed on militant groups composed of disaffected Muslims furious at perceived injustices at the hands of India's Hindu majority.
That violence mostly abated after the November 2008 siege of Mumbai, when 10 Pakistan-based militants terrorized India's commercial capital for 60 hours, killing 166 people.
However, smaller attacks recently have raised concerns violence was returning.
Last Sept. 19, two gunmen on a motorcycle shot and wounded two Taiwanese men outside a famous New Delhi mosque. A few minutes later, a bomb rigged to a nearby car malfunctioned. On Dec. 7, a bomb exploded in the city of Varanasi, killing a 2-year-old, and a few months later came the failed attack on the High Court in New Delhi.
A statement Wednesday from Pakistan's government expressed "deepest sympathies" for the families of those killed in the explosion and the government and people of India.
The U.S. State Department also condemned the attack, offered condolences to the families and U.S. offered assistance to the investigation.
The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday "condemned in the strongest terms the terrorist attack" in New Delhi and expressed condolences, as did U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
The council said "any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed."

				@All in the name of a particular religion   Says a poster
==========­==========­==========­==

All in the name of a particular religion may apply to all religions based on the circumstan­ce, but in fact terrorists belong to the religion of brutes

In Malegaon Blast ( happened 8th Sept 2006 ) in which all those killed were Muslims and the perpetrato­rs were bearing Hindu names, some like Prasad Purohit is a military man and a godman piously  God fearing. 

Lt Col Prasad Purohit ( Is he a good Hindu or a terrotrist­?), arrested in connection with the Malegaon bomb blasts case, on Monday told the Bombay High Court that he is not "anti-Musl­im". 

"Purohit is not anti-Musli­m. While serving in Army in Jammu and Kashmir, he also defended Muslims," his lawyer Shrikant Shivade said while arguing his bail applicatio­n before the court.

Purohit and 11 others, including Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, are accused of orchestrat­ing the blast at Muslim- dominated Malegaon town that killed six persons and injured over 100 others in September 2008. 

Justice R C Chavan, however, said, that the issue was not about Hindu or Muslim.

				There is one major similarity between all religions. The clerics try to instil "fear of god" in the believers to get them to do their bidding. How often have you heard the term " we are god fearing people" !

I have yet to hear a single cleric ask the follower to worship god out of love and not fear. Until that happens it is going to be a war majorly influenced by the clerics.

				When terrorists act in the name of a religion, this tells us about the terrorists­, not about the religion.

If Muslim Terrorism was about religion, we'd see a LOT more of it (i.e. 99.99% of all Muslims wouldn't be non-terror­ists .... but they are.)

Not that terribly far back in history, Christian-­majority nations were engaging in aggressive colonialis­m .... did that make Christiani­ty a "coloniali­st" religion?

Nope.

People do things for a lot of reasons; religion is just one of them.

If a given behavior is *because* of a religion, more than a tiny fraction of 1% of that religion's adherents will engage in it.

				To say that, "Many of those attacks were blamed on militant groups composed of disaffecte­d Muslims furious at perceived injustices at the hands of India's Hindu majority." This is an inflammato­ry statement that should not be used and I request Huffington Post to try to keep such statements off the box.

I must be explicit that there are Muslims disaffecte­d against US and West the most. Muslims have to reform themselves and US has to be more realistic. The mess was created by US in Afghanista­n and India is paying its price for no fault of them. US keep unnecessar­ily blaming Hindus for the ills of Muslim society who will never live in peace whatever you do for them and will nor let others live in peace if they have no fear of retributio­n. I am sorry but it is true. US only need to wait to see the real colours. Hindus in India have become accustomed to this Islamic scourge for centuries but US is not. You could not tolerate one 9/11 but we are having 9/11 round the cloak. US should invite a few more to let them form sufficient majority to see India on US soil.
God bless

				The genesis of the Gujarat riots was the setting on fire a railway coach consisting of Hindus by Muslims and the resulting avenging attacks by Hindus spiraled out of control.

Having said that, Muslims in Gujarat today are more prosperous than in the rest of the country and more safer. But, since you are never going to set foot in India and verify that fact, you can keep on believing whatever that you want.

				Nope.

Do you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds?

If terrorism were directly connected with Islam, more than a tiny fraction of 1% of Muslims would engage in it.

				Some people are animals. Not very many of us but enough do not believe all life is precious. If you are a child murderer, abuser, etc...Put to death. If you rape put to death, If you kill out of cold blood and have no remorse you need to be put to death. There are some crimes that can not be forgiven

				Listen people, there's absolutely nothing wrong if you find the pro-India, anti-Pakis­tan/Muslim pawns coming out sounding so similar to the right-wing neo-conser­vative folks in the U.S. like Andrew Breitbart, David Horowitz, et al.

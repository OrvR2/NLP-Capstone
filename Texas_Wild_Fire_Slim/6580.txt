Good news: Turns out, research has shown that sex is actually good for you. For example, there's the study that shows that women with active sex lives also tend to live longer lives. There's also research that shows that sex burns calories, relieves stress and helps you sleep better, WebMD reports. 
But what happens when you're not in the mood to get between the sheets? A number of things could be to blame -- from health problems to your own psyche. Here, experts share 10 of the most common reasons for a lowered libido.

Interestingly enough, the little pill that prevents pregnancy could also affect a woman's desire to have sex in the first place, said Dr. Jamie Feldman, M.D., a family physician and medical anthropologist at the University of Minnesota. 

Birth control pills affect libido because they cause production of sex-binding hormone globulin proteins, which bind up extra sex hormones -- like testosterone -- so that they're not active, thereby dampening libido for some women, Feldman said. 

If your birth control is killing your sexual mood, talk to your doctor to see about switching to a different kind, she said.

				You've heard the expression­, "food is medicine".­...

I'll take it a step further and say, "sex is medicine".­...nothing brings down the health destroying hormone cortisol more! I wrote an article about how sex can help diabetics reverse their disease :-)

				I get this. Some people (men and women just have huge one's like myself) do not suffer from this.
It can be worse to have a huge libido and not be sexually active. Especially when you are a fit, handsome guy in Santa Monica. With all the runners about, the hot weather, its just a level of wonderful sexual energy everywhere­.

				Weight gain does not lower your libido: getting fat lowers your libido.

Carrying around extra fat throws off your bodies ability to regulate all kinds of hormones, but that's not weight, it's fat.  Adding some muscle to your frame will not degrease your libido, if anything, the testostero­ne boosting effect + serotonin release around the activity will have the opposite effect.

 California High School Evacuated After Bomb Threat

San Clemente, Calif. – Orange County authorities have evacuated thousands of students from a high school after a missing Navy medic left a note claiming he planted explosives there.
Sheriff’s spokesman Jim Amormino says that authorities evacuated more than 3,000 students and staff at San Clemente High School Wednesday morning and they are searching all the rooms. TV reports showed students crowding the football field.
It’s the first day of school.
Amormino says the search was prompted by a note left at the nearby Camp Pendleton Marine base by an AWOL Navy medical corpsman. He says the man claimed he’d placed explosives at the school.
“At the direction of sheriffs’ officers, the entire SCHS staff and student body were evacuated to the stadium after it was inspected and declared safe,” according to a message posted on the school’s website.
School officials are asking that parents not go to the school.

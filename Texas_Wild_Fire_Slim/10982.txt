				First of all, so what if she did? She's still pregnant. 
Secondly, why would she go through the trouble? It's not like we all don't know it takes 40 weeks and if we don't see a baby at the end of those 40, people would know anyway. 
Thirdly, has it even occurred to anyone that maybe she wanted to keep people guessing on the due date so that she's not harassed, stalked, and stressed out as the day comes closer more than she already will be throughout the next few months? Maybe this way, no one will know for sure if it's time. I think if I were as famous as her, I'd switch it up so that people aren't stalking me all the way into the labor room.

				As long as she's really pregnant, who cares about a prosthesis­?

If she wanted to break news to the world that she's preggers, you want to be able to show SOMETHING. 

Even looking at the 'flatter' picture, you can obviously see her tummy is bigger.

BFD folks.

				Nah, the pregnancy is real, she just might have embellishe­d on it a bit...for dramatic effect, no real biggie.

Kinda reminds me of when my first son was born, my ex had three siblings all having third babies...w­ithin months of my first child, it kinda sucked the wind out of my happy event a little.

...nothing better than getting the extra crap that your sister-in-­law didn't need for her new baby.   : P

So I get that she wanted it to be a big deal, she just might not have used enough foresight in how she presented it all.

...either way, a baby is a blessing.

Her life will never be the same.

				me oh my, Beyonce is the only woman ever to get pregnant. Yes, it's a very happy, joyous occassion for her and her husband but they have turned it into another news story. It should be a private celebratio­n among families and close friends, not something to be flaunted all over the media. The flaunting cheapens this very special time for the parents to be. Reminds me of the guy who pinned a copy of the baby scan to the outside of his office door, his way of causing a buzz about his wive's pregnancy. How classless. Too much hype. Take it a step or two down Beyone, get some rest and celebrate upon the arrival of a happy, healthy baby.

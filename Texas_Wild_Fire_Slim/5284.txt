On ‘The Colbert Report,’ Tim Pawlenty uses the phrase ‘up my butt’By Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – 12 hrs ago

Appearing on "The Colbert Report" can be a dicey proposition for politicians looking for campaign publicity. But when you're no longer in the race, there is nothing to lose.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty appeared on the Comedy Central show for "some light-hearted post-campaign debriefing," The Ticket's Chris Moody observed, "and he  said some things you never would have heard him say if he were still  running."
"I came in third place behind Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul," the former Republican candidate told Stephen Colbert on Tuesday night. "I  think that's enough for any one person to endure."
As Moody noted, Pawlenty's staff worked hard to overcome critics who called their candidate "dry" and "boring" with Hollywood action-movie style ads during his short-lived campaign.
"I thought about shooting sparks up my butt," Pawlenty said on "Colbert."

Can he also say "take out those son of a bitches"? Maybe referring to the current administration? Would that be ok too?

and he wonders why he finished behind ron paul and bachmann? might be because we realized he was going to stick something up our butts.

why watch this through Hulu and be pestered with advertising when you can go to Comedy Central and watch it without ads?

Now see that? Had he said that BEFORE and acted like a NORMAL PERSON, he may have had better luck...For as lackluster and edited as most candidates are, now we'll never get to know if  "sparks up my butt" would have endeared him us or not..That's a shame.

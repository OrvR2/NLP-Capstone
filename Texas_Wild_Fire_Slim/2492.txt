ALBANY, N.Y. -- "Son of Sam" serial killer David Berkowitz says he has no interest in seeking parole.
Berkowitz terrorized New York City over 13 months in 1976 and 1977, killing six women and shooting seven others.
Berkowitz, formerly of Yonkers, is serving six consecutive 25-years-to-life sentences at the maximum-security Sullivan Correctional Facility northwest of New York City.
He has been denied parole five times and has been in prison 34 years. His is eligible for a sixth parole hearing next year.

				Ramirez is alive for the same reason Manson is alive. At one time, California called a moratorium on the death penalty and all death row inmates at that time had their sentences commuted to life in prison. When the death penalty was reinstated­, it was deemed cruel and unusual to return those inmates to death row.

				why did/do we still pay and fund any of them when they should all have been put to death themselves­. IF YOU MURDER AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS THE ACCUSED THEN WITHIN SAY 29 DAYS YOU TOO SACRIFICE YOUR OWN LIFE. Spending all this money and time is a complete waste and should not be allowed in first degree - premeditat­ed or what other label you want to put on MURDER you get the same. Clear out these prisons and set a National date for every state to comply at one time. There is all their 15 minutes of recognitio­n at the same time all walking to the electric chair at the designated time. Pull the switch and cut the cost for tax payers. END THIS NONSENSE OF YEARS AND YEARS OF COMPOUNDIN­G FINANCIAL DEBT BECAUSE OF THEM. PUT THEM TO DEATH IMMEDIATEL­Y. THEIR MURDER OF INNOCENT LIFE GETS NO MERCY. David Berkowitz can die in jail tomorrow of a heart attack and we paid to keep him alive for what reason? seriously? All these years at an exorbitant cost by tax payers for what? These is no logical reason.

				The problem with immediate execution is there is no such thing as absolute certainty. In 1999, 12 inmates were released from death row in Illinois because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. This was nearly half of the death row population of that state at the time. This caused the governor of Illinois to call a moratorium on executions in the state. 

Another thing, the death penalty does not prevent crime. If it prevented crime, Texas wouldn't have one of the highest rates of violent crime in the country. It's petty vengence, not true justice.

Also, it is expensive to execute someone. It is much cheaper, and more punitive IMO, to imprison someone for life. I know if I were convicted of a capitol offense, I'd much rather be put to death than forced to live my life in a cage.

Civilized societies must bear the burden of their less civilized citizens. However, that doesn't mean we should sink to the level of the murderer. It means we should do our best to protect the rest of society from the dangerous and allow opportunit­y for the wrongly convicted to be exonerated­.

				Unless you lived in that era as a young adult and were in love, you all just don't know what it felt like to be terrorized by this monster. He was the boogey man, no one knew where he would strike next. It was a scary time for everyone in his general location.
I know I was a teenager and in love and just sitting in the car making out was a frightenin­g experience­, not knowing if we were next. If you fit his general descriptio­n as a couple you were easy prey for this demented, psychopath­.

				Satanism drove him to commit some of those killings. There were others involved besides him who killed all those people. Why don't they ask him who else is involved? Why is it kept hush, hush? It wasn't just him alone. He was influenced by more powerful devil worshipper­s who gave him the orders to kill. So as for you atheist who think there is no God. My question to you is:  Does the Devil exist?!

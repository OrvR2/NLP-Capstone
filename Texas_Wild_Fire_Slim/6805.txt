Shutdown Corner 
Sun Sep 11 04:57pm EDT
VIDEO: Lions’ Tony Scheffler channels his inner pirate in touchdown celebration By      Doug Farrar


Perhaps it was his close proximity to the 43-ton pirate ship built into Tampa's Raymond James Stadium, or perhaps this was his way of saying that he's always wanted to be a Buccaneer. But when Detroit Lions tight end Tony Scheffler(notes) caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matt Stafford with 1:16 left in the first half, he had a little flair to add to the end of the score:

YARRRRR! The Lions won their season opener at the New Sombrero, 27-20, as Stafford threw for 305 yards and three touchdowns.

0 users disliked this comment Robert 2 minutes ago Report Abuse High fives, slaps on the fanny and hugs are OK, but not this.    He should have been penalized for it.    If that's not showing up the opposition, what is?
It's time NFL coaches took control of this nonsense, and benched players for doing this excessive @#$% celebrating.

0 users disliked this comment garyw 7 minutes ago Report Abuse why was he not penalized? how come newton plays the bango and gets penalized, and this guy plays with a sword and doesn't? rules have to be changed on celebrations. either you can or you can't.i don't think anyone should be penalized for any celebration after a t.d. unless it is vulgar,like giving the finger or shoving a football in the face of the other team or against a player or other team, but expressing yourself is okay with me, i think though he should have had a stabbing motion at the end.

0 users disliked this comment ALKALINE  1 hour ago Report Abuse Considering the woes Lion fans have endured for SOOOO long, I wouldn't have cared if he back-flipped back to the bench.
No player, past or present could match the class of Barry Sanders. No celebratory hijinks, just a businessman- like hand the ball to the ball to the ref.
I grew up in Detroit and I've seen all the great baseball and football players of the time. I'm happy the Lions are on a streak. I don't expect them to win the division but they will certainly be entertaining to watch and competititive this season, unlike the disappointments of years gone by.

0 users disliked this comment dropping_cylinder 2 hours ago Report Abuse i think it was kind of funny. Now to whoever said about Green Bay Lambeau Leap, I'm a HUGE Green Bay fan. The Lambeau Leap part of our tradition. everyone from Farve, to Donald Driver to Woodson has all done it. for as long as it's been going on if it was offensive or NFL didn't approve of it I PROMISE   you NFL would of either sent via mail or e-mail a statement not only to the coach,owner and players that "the Lambeau Leap" is no longer acceptable blah blah blah if you do it again we'll "dock you" yards. but since its been going on for years and I'm sure the NFL commissioneer HAS TO know about it by now. He obviously doesn't care.   The one from last or 2 years ago when Chad OhcoCinco(used to be Chad Johnson) when he was with the Bengals and now a Patriot After he scored one of his buddies on the side lines gave him a sumbarow(those big Mexican round hats). I heard he got a fine for that. I didn't consider it offensive. I thought it was kind of funny.

Anyway, she is in the same category as Floyd "the punk" Mayweather. Makes one ashamed to be American and inclined to always pull for the foreigner these days. How sad.

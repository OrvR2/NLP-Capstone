BASTROP, Texas -- Firefighters can't use one of their biggest weapons against a devastating wildfire in Central Texas because they haven't assembled the tanks and pipes to fill a converted jetliner with fire retardant nor a pilot to fly it over the blaze.
The Texas Forest Service says the DC-10 arrived from California on Wednesday, but it won't be used until at least Friday to battle the fire that's destroyed nearly 1,400 homes. Agency spokeswoman Holly Huffman says authorities need that time to assemble the equipment and prepare the retardant.
She says even if the plane and equipment was ready sooner, authorities don't have anyone to fly it because the pilot who was to conduct the drop has worked 14 straight days and must take two days off under policy.

				Will Perry pay any penalty for cutting the budget of volunteer fire fighters in the state by over 50%? Time will tell when the analysis is made about the manpower to fight these fires and what the alternativ­e results would have been had they remained in place! And, will Perry appeal to the govt for aid for the destructio­n? It will happen but Tx not the sharpest knife in the drawer may not put two and two together.

I think its funny when a pedestrian gets hit by a car it was their fault and they were "jaywalking". If it is a celebrity hit; it is an "unmarked crosswalk". If it isn't marked then its not a cross walk. Just saying.

Glad she is okay. We all need to be extra careful to watch for people walking and I have to mention those tiny children who seem to dart out from in between cars. Keep your eyes open everyone! Young or old. Using our phones or not in the car. These things happend fast. Be on guard. Cars are dangerous, and we just forget because we are so used to our routine of driving. On another note, if that woman, being 84, is hitting people with her car, she may need to be off the road at this point. If that had been a small child, it could have been worse.

"Unmarked crosswalk" They shouldn't have sighted the old lady.

Be street smart by look left and right before crossing. Don't give so much trust on the driver or to  the stop light/stop sign. Self aware a must at all time.

I know those crosswalks in Santa Monica. They're reliant on people actually noticing that they're there, and yielding. No thanks. I'll run to the next traffic signal. Geez. What was it, 3 years ago, that some old man ran down a bunch of people at the Santa Monica farmers market?

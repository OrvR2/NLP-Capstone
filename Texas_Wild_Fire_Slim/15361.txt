Learn about healthy dinning at Garland's Healthy Living Expo.
Living a healthy lifestyle is a twenty-four hour, 365 day task. Staying up-to-date on ways to remain healthy is important for living a long and productive life as well as teaches your child the fundamentals of remaining healthy. At the end of the month, The City of Garland will be offering every resident the special opportunity to learn about staying healthy, and protecting the environment, at Healthy Living Expo 2011.
The annual Healthy Living Expo is an event full of hands-on activities and informative exhibits sponsored by The City of Garland, Garland ISD, Baylor Medical Center and Garland Chamber of Commerce. Every event and activity at the expo is designed to inform you and your family on the multiple ways to maintain a healthy environment and personal healthy regiment. Additionally, Healthy Living Expo will have the Garland Youth Council present to give parents tips and tricks for making teens safe drivers, and other city officials will be present to demonstrate how to have your household prepared for natural and man-made disasters.
Healthy You is another important exhibition that will be at the expo. Healthy You will be offering free screenings for bone density, blood pressure and cholesterol. The exhibit will also have trained professionals giving advice about nutrition and exercising as well. Parents that need those pesky flu shots can also grab one at the Healthy You exhibit.
Healthy Living Expo is scheduled for September 24 from 9am to 1pm. The expo will take place at 4999 Naaman Forest Boulevard, and admission is free of charge. Gather the entire family for this great educational event. The exhibits and activities might not be as exciting as a festival or fair, but the information that is being offered should not be missed.

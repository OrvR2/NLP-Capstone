HOUSTON (KTRK) -- 
Opening statements begin this morning in the assault trial of local hand surgeon Michael Brown.  He's accused of assaulting his wife last year.

Let us know!    Dr. Brown has a previous conviction for assaulting another wife, and that means the jury will hear about that relationship as well.  Brown completed community service for that previous assault, which erased it from his record.  He pleaded no contest to the assault which happened in 2002. That was an aggravated assault for beating his then-pregnant third wife, Darlina Brown, with a bed post. He was sentenced to 10 years' supervised probation and fined $1,500. But if convicted on these new assault charges, his past could land him in prison.   It means prosecutors have a special circumstance on their hands that makes the misdemeanor assault a felony.  He is charged with beating his fourth wife, Rachel Brown, by twisting her arm behind her back last year. </p.The 54-year-old doctor is also not practicing medicine anymore, not because he retired voluntarily.   Brown was stripped of his medical license in 2006 over cocaine use.   "I don't think the judge wants us to try this case in the media.  We're very happy with the jury for a whole year. And we're gonna go forward with this trial.  We're anxious about it," said Brown's attorney, Dick Deguerin.   The jury can expect to hear a long list of witnesses, everyone from Brown's former wives, former employees  and those who worked with him on his probation, during which he attended anger management classes.   If convicted, Brown could face up to 10 years in prison.

When penalty kicks result in falling down and getting a yellow card By      Brooks Peck



A couple years ago, the paradinha (or "little stop") penalty kick approach was all the rage in Brazil (here's Retired Ronaldo doing it properly). But, ahead of the 2010 World Cup, FIFA outlawed the move, specifying that "feinting in the run-up to take a penalty kick to confuse opponents is permitted, however feinting to kick the ball once the player has completed his run-up is now considered an infringement."
It seems Al Ahly's Amir Sayoud never heard about this rule change, though, because in his side's 4-0 win over Kima Aswan in Egypt, he attempted to execute a paradinha and it went very wrong. After completing his run up to the ball, Sayoud stopped and tried to fake the shot, but his foot got caught, causing him to slip and fall as he actually kicked a slow dribbler towards the goalkeeper. And just to turn all that could've gone wrong on this sequence into a reality, the ref pulled out the yellow since Sayoud feinted only after he reached the ball.
The good news for Sayoud? I'm sure he's now very much aware of FIFA's paradinha rules.

6 users disliked this comment Steel City 44 minutes ago Report Abuse Huh people think soccer is falling down dramatically. No thats gay    @#$% er ball (basketball) where the guys fall down every two seconds cause they got touched. Penalties literally every 10 seconds. And Gods easiest scoring ever know to man. Seriously at least a goal in soccer is exciting. You idiots get mad when a NBA game doesnt break 100. Shows how much sophistication you idiots have thinking basketball is actually a good sport. Maybe if you didnt have the attention span of a squirrel, you could watch a real sport like soccer.

4 users disliked this comment joey 53 minutes ago Report Abuse Strange, I thought soccer players are known for falling down all on their own and rolling on the ground pretending something hurts and getting a free penalty kick for it. Its rare to see a yellow card for a player doing that.

0 users disliked this comment Adam  1 hour ago Report Abuse The coach needs to grow up. It was a penalty call, wah, everyone has short comings. A good leader grows past miniscule issues. Whether it means doing good or bad, winning or losing, they get over it and do their @#$% job the best they can. Leave throwing fits to little kids.
             And speaking of growing up, part of my facmily is jewish, I'm partially german, I have black relatives, that's blood btw, and at least a few gay friends. I love stereotypes and I can laugh at myself. people are people each one of us are the same, human, and different in just as many ways. We all have our faults, get over it.

2 users disliked this comment Carl C.  1 hour ago Report Abuse Having been a soccer player, I just discovered that the guy may have purposely fallen. Interesting! Well, let's think about our own soccer and own players. I have been so much concerned until I read the book: "Wake Up and Win, America! Do It Now." I really learnt a lot from the novel of about 430 pages. Great! Every coach or soccer player that reads that book can't help but play better to have us win in future international soccer   tournaments. Absolutely thrilling and entertaining, though!

4 users disliked this comment John F.  1 hour ago Report Abuse Football/soccer is a game of endurance.   Two forty five minute halves of solid running, compared to an actual play time of ten minutes in American football.   In American football a play lasts what, ten seconds at most, and then they stand in a huddle for a minute or two, unless someone calls for a time out.   Low scoring game, yes, but that means you have two well matched teams.   No, it's not like basketball where they score everytime they get the ball.   Soccer/football is a civilized game, with no fighting, or no arguing with the ref.   That is not part of the game.   When a player is ejected from a game, they are not allowed to substitute another player for the ejected player, and the team plays short handed.   For those of you who make fun of the world's most popular game, you do so because you can't do it.   And you know us Americans, if we can't do something well, we make fun of it.

‘Venomous’ Nadal angry about rain, lashes out at U.S. Open referee By      Chris Chase


Rafael Nadal was among a number of players upset about being forced to take the court in misty conditions Wednesday at the U.S. Open. The defending tournament champion made his stance known by waiting nearly 10 minutes to emerge from the locker room. He later lashed out at tournament referee Brian Early after another band of rain delayed play after 15 minutes on the court.
"It's the same old story," Nadal said to Early of the decision to play in the light rain. "All you think about is money."
ESPN's Pam Shriver said Nadal appeared "venomous" after going down 0-3 to Gilles Muller before the rain delay. Their match had been postponed from Tuesday and was delayed an hour on Wednesday because of inclement weather.
In Nadal's mind, it never should have started.
He first expressed his anger with the passive-aggressive waiting game before the match. While Muller waited by the doors to walk out into Arthur Ashe Stadium, Nadal lingered in the locker room for eight minutes before joining him. He was asked about it by ESPN's Tom Rinaldi in the pre-match interview and unconvincingly blamed it on a miscommunication with the ATP:
"Sorry for that. It was a little bit of my fault but more fault from the ATP because they don't have to put to Gilles on court if I'm not ready. With the rain delays you never know when you have to go on court. I have to do all the tapes, I cannot do the tapes [30 minutes] before the match. I have to do it at the last moment and I have to know exactly when I have to go to the court. They told me that at the last minute. I thought we would go on later. What cannot happen is Gilles waiting for me. So sorry for that, sorry for Gilles, sorry for everybody."
It was a fine response even if it rang a little hollow. ESPN had been telling viewers that play was set to begin around noon ET for the previous hour. If Chris Fowler knew when Nadal was supposed to take the court, surely Nadal did too.
His later actions suggest the same. Nadal was clearly displeased during warm-ups and at the start of the match. Dispirited, he was broken in his first service game and was down 0-3 when the rain halted play. Nadal briefly exchanged words with Early and stormed off the court.
As of 1:30 p.m. ET, rain continued to fall in New York with little sign of stopping in the near future.

1 users disliked this comment lifeisswell 14 hours ago Report Abuse The health of the players has to come first - not the almighty dollar!   Playing on a wet court would be very dangerous for them.   This was really a no-brainer, so I can't figure out why Nadal is being made out to be a spoiled brat.

0 users disliked this comment paul 15 hours ago Report Abuse Nadal always gives 100% when he's playing. Combine that with the fact that this outburst is totally out of character. Factor in that playing full tilt on wet surfaces can be career-ending... conclusion: give Nadal a break.

3 users disliked this comment Sneaks 18 hours ago Report Abuse Here's an idea, build some indoor courts....then we don't have to listen to this cry babies.

I dont' care if they're star athletes, i don't care if they donate every single penny they make to charity...the fact remains, they're cry babies...Man up, you're a professional athlete who already gets coddled.

When will society learn, stop giving these professional athletes everything they want, they are here for our entertainment.

0 users disliked this comment graham 19 hours ago Report Abuse ATP is being critised from many quarters regarding their lack of concern for players. What ever you think of tennis players, they are an expensive commodity, providing entertainment to many. They create a generous income for themselves while at the same time providing profits for the organisers. The least these money making organisers could do is provide suitable facilities for the players or make sure the conditions are acceptable to prevent unnessary injuries. Seems the Americans are not up to par with the rest of the tennis world

0 users disliked this comment Ben 19 hours ago Report Abuse Here we go with another media article that's designed to put an athlete or celebrity in the worst light possible.   Nadal looked "venemous"!   They post a photo of him under an umbrella for a moment that makes him look like he's as egotistical as possible.    They grab this and that out of context and make an article out of it.   

What is it with journalism these days and the negativity?   Moreover, what's with so many people apparently "buying in" to the article, and commenting as if they are personally acquainted with Nadal or the celebrity being discussed.      I supposed we have "Reality TV," so we might as well have "Reality News" too.

0 users disliked this comment WHATTYATHINK 23 hours ago Report Abuse ... got'ta agree with Nadal on this one.   Performing at peak in a challenging sport is not an easy task. One torn muscle or sprained ankle and his career is likely over.   

... in some respects his concerns remind me of my days as a Little League umpire ... on the threat of a storm with approaching thunder and lightening I would call the game.   Some parents and most coaches would give me the "lip" for calling the game too early mindful that in their opinion there was enough time to get another inning or two in.   My comment was always ... better to call a game too early than too late ...

2 users disliked this comment Lorne Thu Sep 08, 2011 05:29 pm PDT Report Abuse ...if the risk of injury is increased on hard courts that are damp (and they certainly are) ...then Nadal is very correct in letting out his emotions (which he rarely does). Risking his, and his opponent's season or career, over "TV timing" or otherwise is not acceptable. Yes, these are mult-million dollar tournaments littered with the odd primadona athlete, but just as the hockey rule book is likely to be modified because of concerns over concusions and injury ...we must always put the health of the athletes before anything else.

And you know what's the sad truth? he's right ...it is always about money. Perhaps this story will get some publicity traction and cause pro tennis rethink its mission before someone's season ends because of injury.

1 users disliked this comment Danny Murphy Thu Sep 08, 2011 04:00 pm PDT Report Abuse We all get angry sometimes here and there. It's a natural reaction to be upset and to react or overreact!

He is not the first one that lost his cool... Give this guy a brake? from what I have heard, Nadal is actually a very nice guy.
He just got caught up in a bad and awkward situation and he reacted to it.

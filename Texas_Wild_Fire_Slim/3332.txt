NBC's Andrea Mitchell announced on air Wednesday that she has breast cancer.
Mitchell, who has been with NBC for decades and serves as its chief foreign affairs correspondent and host of "Andrea Mitchell Reports" on MSNBC, made the announcement at the end of her show. She is 64 years old.
"I had planned to be hiking in Wyoming last week but instead discovered that I am now among the one in eight women — incredibly, one in eight — who’ve had breast cancer," she said. "Mine was discovered during my annual screening just a short time ago. Lucky for me, I’m one of the fortunate ones. We discovered it in the earliest stage, it has not spread, and I’m already back at work with a terrific prognosis."
Mitchell said that breast cancer awareness and prevention has always been important to her.
"I’m looking at this as another of life’s lessons," she said. "For you women out there and for the men who love you, screening matters. Do it."
Other NBC journalists tweeted messages of support to Mitchell. "Bravo Andrea," the "Today" show's Savannah Guthrie wrote. "You are most adored."

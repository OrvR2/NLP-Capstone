After plane crash, KHL asks for patience on Lokomotiv plans By      Greg Wyshynski


Let's be clear here: After the plane crash that killed nearly "everyone from the main roster" of the KHL's Lokomotiv Yaroslavl team, the primary focus from the hockey world is on remembering those who lost their lives and offering condolences to friends and loved ones.
[See photos from the Russian plane crash]
But we're probably not the only ones wondering how the Kontinental Hockey League will handle this tragedy logistically. It's cold, business of hockey stuff; but it's part of the story, and the League acknowledged that in a statement on Wednesday morning:
On Wednesday, September 7, the sport of hockey witnessed a devastating loss. A YK-42 plane that was carrying the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl hockey team to its first game of the 2011/2012 Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) season in Minsk, crashed while departing from Yaroslavl.
KHL statement regarding today's tragedy in Yaroslavl:
"We are only beginning to understand the impact of this tragedy affecting the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl club and the international hockey community. First and foremost, our condolences go out to the families and friends of the players, coaches and staff lost in today's tragedy.
"We know that there are many in the KHL family who will be grieving with us. As the investigation of this tragedy progresses we will work closely with investigators, government officials, club executives and the Yaroslavl community. We are working to find an appropriate way to honor this club and begin the healing process from the deep loss so many of us feel today.
"We are aware that many of you have questions. This tragedy remains our primary focus. We ask for patience as we find an appropriate way to proceed with the 2011/2012 season. We will continue to communicate our plans as they take shape."
The KHL faces an inconceivable decision: How to proceed with a season when one of its franchises lost its entire roster to tragedy.

Will games be cancelled? The KHL current plans on holding the three games scheduled for Thursday while cancelling Lokomotiv vs. Dynamo Minsk. On the schedule: Avangard vs. Sibir; Yugra vs. Avtomobilist; and CSKA vs. Mettalurg Magnitogorsk.
Via Puck Daddy's Dmitry Chesnokov:
Even though the games are to go on, the KHL will hold "minutes of  silence" tomorrow and all "entertainment" activities at games have been  canceled.
The decision of whether Lokomotiv will participate in this year's tournament will be made at a later date.
The KHL will also decide later what to do with the Salavat Yulaev - Atlant game that was played and halted today
I was told the League is reviewing several options as far as how they will proceed.  He didn't disclose what the options were.
The  reason everything is remaining the same as far as scheduling etc is  because the League wants everyone (every official) to get together to  decide what the next steps will be.  The KHL says there is a lot of  conflicting and untrue information online as far as what this regular  season will be.  So, they will get together to discuss the next steps,  they want everyone there, as cool headed as they could possibly be.  The  KHL didn't want to make any rush decisions, want to think things  through.
The reason the KHL management is all over the country is because today is the start of the season.
It is unclear if the KHL has a contingency plan at this point.
Who will play for Lokomotiv this season? Should Lokomotiv play this season? Slava Malamud of Sports-Express offered this bit of information: "Legendary coach Viktor Tikhonov(notes) suggests every KHL team send at least one player to Lokomotiv to salvage the team's season."
From JP at Japers' Rink, an interesting 2009 article from Metro on how the NHL would handle a tragedy: 
If a team is left with fewer than 14 players and one goaltender  following some sort of catastrophe, the league sets in motion its  Emergency Rehabilitation Plan.
First, the "disabled team" would  be allowed to negotiate to buy players under contract from other teams,  with payment coming from the insurance money.
If that didn't fill  out the roster, a draft would be held, much like an expansion draft.  Teams could protect 10 players and one goalie.
The disabled team  would be allowed to take no more than one player from each of the other  teams. The price for each player is $1 million in insurance money.
Obviously, there are ways to approach this type of tragedy.
One thing we'd like to see: Something from the NHL to honor the memory of their alumni, whether it's a patch or a sticker on the uniform or a league-wide moment of silence on opening night.

1 users disliked this comment spartacusnow 13 hours ago Report Abuse NHL's plan is that each team actually has an insurance policy to deal with buying players from other teams in the event of a tragedy.   If I was a player I would make sure that Larry Silverstein(owner of World Trade Center in NY)   had no connections with team I played on.

Sometimes I wonder if many people who die are actually really dead but they have been shuffled off to some outpost on Mars or one of Jupiter or Saturn's moons or somewhere in a solar system close to ours.   
Don't call me crazy the technology exists to move humans from earth to a planet/moon   or solar system close to earth.

"Lokomotive" in Russian   related directly to rail roads, why the hack they need a plane.

1 users disliked this comment Chris Thu Sep 08, 2011 08:47 pm PDT Report Abuse My personal thought: Each opposing team should forfeit their games for the entire season, thus having Lokomotiv be the only team in professional hockey to ever have a perfect season. A minor consolation for the devastation this has caused, but a small token of remembrance for the players and coaches lost.

Hockey is a passion, a good game to be played, brings down borders between nations. Brad MacKrimon was a warrior on ice and I'm sure coached the same way! To all the Russian players and families, I as a canadian have you in prayers. May God bless you.

Maybe allow farm leaguers go over and play a season if they chose to or something and have a day dedicated to that flight like the outdoor game or something of that signifigance

8 users disliked this comment W C Thu Sep 08, 2011 11:25 am PDT Report Abuse Considering the delapitated condition of the airline equipment utilized in that country....I'm surpirsed it has taken this long for a disaster to attract international attention.   Do we (as citizends of the world) have an international airline association that governs all airlines throughout the world...or do we have to still rely upon the Russians to provide us with a safe mode of flight within thier borders.   Cleary, they are not capable of keeping their equipment in safe operating condition.

This shortcoming on safety is prevalent throughout all of the Russian country and all of thier industires, nuclear, oilfield, and the list goes on...

If you want to live longer, do not fly domestic flights in Russia.

Sadly, condolences to the families will not change anything.

Play your hearts out guys because its what hockey players do.   They play through the pain of broken bones and fractures and it may seem an impossibility, but broken hearts too.   Play the best you can this season and above all, play for the hockey club.

0 users disliked this comment Drager Thu Sep 08, 2011 11:01 am PDT Report Abuse Dave King said in an interview with Peter Mansbridge on CBC that he spoke to Brad about taking a coaching job in Russia and told Brad on several occasions during the conversation he did not trust the planes used to charter hockey teams, that they were old and usually carried to much weight for there size, King said Brad laughed it off and it cost him his life. They were a disaster waiting to happen and now it has happened, very sad.

3 users disliked this comment Dupster Thu Sep 08, 2011 09:50 am PDT Report Abuse No, the season should NOT be cancelled.   Yes, give everyone time to mourn, but, life must go on, and sports is a fantastic distraction to get your mind off things.   Let's remember almost a decade ago with what when on in NYC on September 11th.   Many, MANY more people lost their lives that day and NYC was a mess.   Sports helped people move on, and that NY Jets NFL game was very inspiring - and this is from a Canadian living on the West Coast.

People need time to mourn, and how on earth will players be able to play well and focus while they are greiving such a loss.   Who will be able to come out and cheer and clap and smile with this looming over their heads.   Hey North America did without the NHL for a year, they can shut down the KHL for a season.Comment hidden due to low rating.  Show Comment

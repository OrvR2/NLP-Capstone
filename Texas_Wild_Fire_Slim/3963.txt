May 6, 2009--LUFKIN, Texas--Texas Forest Service (TFS) is hosting the 12th Annual East Texas Interagency Wildfire and Incident Management Academy May 19-29 at Angelina College in Lufkin, Texas. Emergency personnel from across the United States are invited to participate in the nationally-standardized training.This year, the academy offers 22 National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) courses, which range from basic wildland firefighting to fire supervisory and administrative techniques to basic air operations. The courses help participants complete the qualifications required for specified positions, or assignments, on an incident.Academy training focuses on wildland firefighting, the incident command system, leadership and public information. The incident command system teaches emergency personnel to manage any incident – from floods and tornados to wildfires or acts of terrorism – in a safe and efficient manner. All of the courses taught at the academy are part of a standardized training curriculum developed by the NWCG, a federal-state interagency group that also develops position qualifications for wildland firefighters.“A key benefit of the wildfire academy is that a large number of personnel from state, federal and local agencies can come together and share experiences as well as expertise,” said Meredith Middlebrook, registrar for the academy. “The standardized courses and experience requirements for each position in the fire organization help ensure that persons with the same position rating can be seamlessly interchanged in the fire management team without affecting team capabilities or organizational efficiency.”Training tuition assistance is available to qualified fire departments through TFS under the Rural Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Program (HB 2604) – up to a maximum of $490 per trainee ($70 per day) and a maximum of $4,000 per department. To apply, call (979) 458-6505 or visit http://ticc.tamu.edu/hb2604.htm. Applications for training assistance must be submitted to the Emergency Services Grants Division before the course date.Course and registration information is available at http://ticc.tamu.edu/training.htm, by email at academyregistrar@tfs.tamu.edu or at (979) 458-7330.ContactsMeredith MiddlebrookAcademy Registrar(979) 458-7330Mahlon HammetterAcademy Information Officer(936) 639-8162 – office(936) 546-1895 – cell

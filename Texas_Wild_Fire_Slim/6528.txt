							 Font ResizeSan Jose council keeps labor concession talks closedBy John Woolfolkjwoolfolk@mercurynews.comPosted: 09/07/2011 06:06:13 PM PDTUpdated: 09/07/2011 06:06:15 PM PDTLeaders of five unions representing librarians, planners, building inspectors, engineers, clerical workers and others said Wednesday that the city has rebuffed their requests for open talks on pension reforms and asked that the city state its refusal to publicly negotiate with them in writing.San Jose officials and their employee unions have been battling over concessions city leaders say are needed to curb runaway employee costs, particularly for retirement pensions, that have helped drive 10 years of budget shortfalls.Mayor Chuck Reed has proposed reduced benefits for future city hires and slower pension increases for current and retired city workers. The council has approved negotiations with unions on language for a ballot measure next spring on changes.Councilman Pierluigi Oliverio has long advocated that the council allow public negotiations, but the issue has gained little traction with the rest of the council.City negotiators have argued that public talks are difficult to schedule and hinder agreements. The city experimented with open negotiations earlier this year with the small union representing city attorneys. But those open talks didn't yield an agreement. The city posts all correspondence and proposals with its unions online for public review.Yolanda Cruz, president of the city's largest union, the Municipal Employees' Federation, said the five unions mostly want to dispell a public perception that they are Advertisementrefusing to cooperate on concession talks."We're here bargaining in good faith," Cruz said, "and working on proposals."Contact John Woolfolk at 408-975-9346.Print

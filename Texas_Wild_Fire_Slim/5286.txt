Presidential address change forces Time’s 9/11 event to replace Hillary Clinton with GiulianiBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – 9 hrs ago

The move of President Barack Obama's address to a joint session of Congress to Thursday to accommodate Wednesday's Republican primary debate has indirectly claimed a media-related casualty.
Tomorrow night's advance screening of Time magazine and HBO's "Beyond 9/11: Portraits of Resilience" was supposed to include a Q&A with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Not anymore.
"Due to the President's address to Congress now planned for tomorrow evening, Thursday, September 8th, Secretary Clinton is unable to join us at the Beyond 9/11 event," a statement from the event organizers reads. "We are pleased that former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will now join Richard Stengel for a conversation after the screening."
Giuliani will likely face questions about a possible 2012 election bid.
In an appearance at the National Press Club Tuesday,  Giuliani said he still hasn't made a  final decision about whether he'll make a second bid for the Republican  nomination.
"It would be difficult for me to be nominated," Giuliani said. "We'd have to be truly desperate."
Meanwhile, HBO's cable news sibling, CNN, is planning special coverage of Obama's address on job creation, with Wolf Blitzer anchoring coverage beginning at 5 p.m., and CNN International simulcasting the event.

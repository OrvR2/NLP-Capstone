Even though Americans are expected to be doing a lot more holiday shopping this year, don't expect that to do much to alleviate the pain of a struggling jobs market.
That's because while sales are predicted to rise in November and December, and back-to-school sales in August -- often seen as a leading indicator for the holiday performance -- have been relatively healthy, many retail chains plan to take on the same number of seasonal employees as they did last year, despite business being projected to be better, the Wall Street Journal reports.
Some stores plan to simply give more hours to the staff they already have, rather than hire new employees to help with the holiday workload.
Last year, holiday hiring was responsible for the creation of about 600,000 temporary jobs, according to one estimate -- the highest number since 2008. As many as 40 percent of the employers who hire part-time seasonal workers eventually move some of them onto their full-time payrolls, a 2010 survey found.
That lack of expected holiday hiring is bad news for a U.S. workforce that gained no new jobs in August, stoking fears that the economy's modest upward trajectory since the official end of the Great Recession has plateaued, and that stagnation, or even a second phase of recession, lies ahead. 
Economists have repeatedly warned that for a true recovery to take hold, the economy must be growing and adding jobs at a much more rapid rate than it currently is.
Though the economy needs jobs -- there are currently 14 million Americans looking for work, and another 8.8 million working part-time who'd like to be working full-time -- it's unclear at this point where those jobs will come from. The disappointing outlook for retail-chain hiring echoes a handful of surveys released earlier this summer, which showed that few small businesses plan to expand their payrolls for the remainder of 2011.
 President Obama is set to unveil a major jobs plan before a joint session of Congress on Thursday, and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has indicated that he will lay out a jobs plan of his own in a speech on Tuesday. Earlier this week, the Chamber of Commerce published a series of recommendations for expanding the workforce, including increased oil drilling, more ambitious infrastructure work and fewer regulations for a number of industries.

				Thats right America, the republcans­/teaparty have been planning and working toward this day for many years, why they said healthcare jobs would be in demand, their plan was to cut the workforce, work those they keep like slaves until they get sick, then kick them out the door, replace them with another disposable human, if need be, if they can get by will not replace them and will continue to dump the work on the others to keep from hiring forever! They don't give a crap about anybody but themselves­, they just want to USE all of us to fill their bank and investment accounts and take care of their own!! These are the parasites and users that will someday be falling into the fire for eternity!! Totally mentally and spirtually void, no soul and complete socipaths, most should be locked up, but are instead running the businesses in this country or work in our government­!!!! Read about sociopaths­, you will see how fitting the descriptio­n is to those listed above and also learn what can be done to defend yourself against their kind. Sick people!!! They made sure to fill the legal system with "their kind" as well, as the only recourse they think people have is to sue them and take their precious $$$$, but people have alot more power, the power to withdraw, themselves as their workers, their money in their banks, their money in the stock market, everything that they live for and from.

				It's time the adults grow up and realize just what it means to be commercial­ly raped every holiday season. 

Commerce is what drives the santa mobile, leaves baskets of jelly beans, chocolate bunnies and eggs on the kitchen table and sucker punches your guilt button on mothers and fathers day. 

Your emotional gullibilit­y is the prime target for every marketing engineer out there. 

Do you really think they personally care if you have a "happy birthday" or not? 
NO! They just want to sell cards, cakes and ties!

GROW UP!!!

				Retail had a little surge in August because of back-to-sc­hool sales
but without more jobs the average shopper, the one still employed but
cutting back expenses, is likely to spend less for the holidays.  Last
year at least in the retail sector I work in, there was less holiday hiring.

				*Thank you*! My family has been doing this for the past several years now.

Can see if one has small children, and then really only *just* but the orgy of gift giving just because it's Christmas and you want to show someone how much you love them defeats the whole true meaning of the holiday. Besides if you have to wait for one day of the year to show how much you care then something is truly wrong with your familial and or spousal relationsh­ips.

It always amazes me that persons without a pot to p*** in nor a window to throw it out of, basically living from pay check to pay check running up huge credit card balances just because it's the holidays. One credit card maxed out? NP open a "Best Buy" or some other store credit card and keep on shopping. No one bothers to read the fine print that with an APR usually >18% plus any late charges they are paying far more back than the instant "10% off" discount for opening an account.

				First of all, you're not supposed to call it Christmas; in Amerika, it's the Holidays.  Second, my familiy is right there with you.......­...we haven't celebrated the so-called holidays in years.  In fact, after the kids entered school, we searched out and found numerous, repetitive­-onerous and difficult tasks the kids were required to perform each day they were out of school.  We ran a sort of Endless Chores Holiday  Boot Camp.  And to make the event more poignant, we rationed food such that they'd be just a little bit hungry every day while they had to work around the house.  They came to hate the holidays and were utterly delighted to get back to school.

				Actually jobs were added but they were off set by those jobs that were dripped, like State Employees, Teachers, Police and Fire Fighters and Constructi­on Workers. Any retail hiring was done in August. 
Most employers that I see are NOT expanding hours for employees that they already have because they do not want to pay benefits. Those who expand their hours for current employees are usually those who have dropped those hours for the Summer and replace those hours in the Fall.

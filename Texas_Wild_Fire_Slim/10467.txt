[ Print | 

 ]



In April 2005, Texas Forest Service conducted a five-percent sample of public street trees for the City of Colleyville, Texas. During the survey, potential planting sites in the public right-of-way and on private front yards were also recorded.  Overall, the survey found that the street tree population is estimated to contain 36% oak species (14% post oaks) and a total of 11,900 street trees.  Most trees are under 10” diameter, indicating an overall young forest.  Eighty-eight percent of the trees are in at least fair condition, with 50% listed as good or excellent. The value for Colleyville’s trees is estimated to be more than $20 million based on the Tree and Plant Appraisal Guide, 9th Edition. An abundance of possible planting sites were identified on both public and private land.  It is estimated that there are more than 20,000 of these potential planting sites. Recommendations include both short- and long-term options.  Major recommendations include increasing tree plantings, reducing risk by training young trees, annual inspections of all street trees and developing an annual work plan. Other short-term recommendations include additional staff training and ISA certification, as well as increasing public awareness of the value of the community forest. Long-term recommendations include a 100 percent public tree inventory in order to develop a master plan for management of this valuable resource.

Supermarket Standoff: Granola Bars 
By Julia Bainbridge, BonAppetit.com
We have embarked on a taste test tour of supermarket foods. We nibble (or sip), we score, and we share the results to help you avoid the paralysis of Brand Choice Overload. Today's topic: granola bars.

It's back-to-school time for America's kids (some, apparently, have been back for a couple of weeks, much to the surprise of those of us used to the traditional post-Labor Day start). That means Moms and Dads need easy snacks on hand, likely ones of the healthy, pre-made, individually wrapped variety. Enter the granola bar.
"Healthy," however, is not a very appealing word to toddlers and tweens. We confirmed this with one of our staffers who spent college summers as a nanny. Her compromise? Go for granola bars with chocolate in them. They still make for a healthy-ish tummy-filler (think of the chocolate chips in trail mix), and the little ones' eyes will light up at the chance to eat something sweet before facing down, say, brussels sprouts.
So for this week's Supermarket Standoff, we sampled 10 kid-friendly (read: chocolate-packed) granola bars. While we crunched and scored, dietician Marissa Lippert broke down the nutrition labels.

#3 Cascadian Farm  Mixed Nut Chewy Granola Bar

Blind Tasting Notes: "Nutty, and nice salt, but the oil tastes rancid"; "I dig the peanuts"; "More like a candy bar than a granola bar"; "Like the thin layer of chocolate on the bottom"; "Basically a Pay Day bar."


Nutritionist Marissa Lippert's Picks
Some comments from Lippert: "As usual, I first weeded out products whose ingredient lists included my red flag words: "hydrogenated" and "artificial" anything. Then I looked at the fiber and protein content of the bars. A bar should have at least 3 grams of fiber to be a satisfying snack -- this will keep your energy levels steady for longer. Protein also helps with this, and you want it to come from a wholesome, natural source like nuts or peanut butter. The Fiber One bars had the most fiber of the bunch, but it was primarily from chicory root extract, a food additive that can cause digestive trouble. The bar had the greatest amount of sugar among the group. All that said, I've gone with the following picks out of the brands that were tested. My favorite granola bars, though, are 18 Rabbits; they've got rock-solid ingredients, and they taste great."








New England Naturals
          



#1 New England Naturals Chocolate-Omega
Nutrition: One serving (1 bar / 34g) = 140 calories, 4g total fat, 0mg sodium, 25g carbs, 11g sugars, 2g dietary fiber, 3g protein, 4% iron.

Ingredients: Organic whole rolled oats, organic rice syrup, organic crisp brown rice with organic rice syrup, organic chocolate chips (organic sugar, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin, organic vanilla), organic apricots with organic rice flour, organic flax meal, organic walnuts, organic hemp seed, organic soy fiber, organic expeller pressed canola oil, organic orange flavor. Contains soy, walnuts.

Cost:  $3.00 for a box of 5 at Whole Foods in New York City.

 Marissa's Comment: This one's a tad low on the fiber, coming in at 2g , but it's got an ingredient list that's the most straight and narrow, and that gets bonus points with me!

Our assessment: There was a pronounced flavor in this bar that was different from all the rest. Some of our tasters described it as "citrus rind," some as "black licorice," and others as "Pine Sol." It didn't fare too well in other departments, either: "Super dense--feels like a protein bar"; "What's happening here? Gross."







Kashi TLC
    
#2 Kashi TLC Cherry Dark Chocolate Chewy Granola Bar

Our assessment: Our tasters like how this looked -- "visible oats" -- and gave kudos for the dried fruit, but the flavor in general was off. Many commented on the "weird aftertaste."

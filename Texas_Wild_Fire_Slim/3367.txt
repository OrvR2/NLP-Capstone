Ed Schultz mounted a robust defense of union leader Jimmy Hoffa on his Tuesday show.
Hoffa has been under fire recently after he told a crowd in Detroit to "take out these son-of-a-bitches" in the Tea Party in the 2012 election. Conservatives saw the comments as a call to violence. Schultz did not see it that way.
"Now, this is just Ed talking: I think he's spot on!" he said. "...Hoffa fights fire with fire and this is what I think workers and middle classers in this country want."
Schultz then criticized Fox News for what he called a "fake outrage machine" over the comments. He said the network had selectively edited Hoffa's remarks to remove any reference to voting.
"Mr. Hoffa clearly wasn't calling for violence against the Tea Party," Schultz said. "...This is an ideological war going on in this country and liberals need to fight. Not with guns, not with knives...just do it with the ballot box."
Hoffa appeared on the show after Schultz' monologue. He refused to back down from his comments.

				No Repulican Presidenti­al candidate or Tea Party supporter has called to abolish Unions or the right to organize.T­here is however a solid movement by the taxpayers in a number of states to force public/gov­ernment union members to pay a portion of their benifits inorder to reduce the burden on non government­al taxpayers and balance state budgets. Hoffa is no working man. He is a highly paid Union boss who talks the tough talk but has never risk anything ever in his life.

				Then why are Wisconsin School districts suddenly able to afford salaries for teachers with no layoffs? Because school districts no longer HAVE to buy Union healthcare insurance. They now can buy it on the open market and its much cheaper. This saved each district 100's of thousands. Other states are trying to do the same thing(ohio­). The Unions know all that extra money they get goes in the democrats pockets and buys influence. So the UNIONS DID cause much of the mess the states are in. FDR was 100% against Unions for government workers because the Unions donate money to candidates who, when elected give the Union everything they want. Who cares about the taxpayer.

				FOX and the Right wing nuts can not under any circumstan­ces live by the truth. They always must twist the truth or tell an outright lie. I have never seen such a disregard for truth in all my 72 years. It is time for the rest of the media to call FOX out when they start this lying about people and events. Is there no integrity left in the Republican ranks? Must they all jump on the lying bandwagon, the real crime is that these people proclaim that they are the voice of Christiani­ty and I wonder if God would let such a bunch of liars live. Evidently they relly don't believe in GOD because they certainly don't fear GOD.

				Ah, see?  Proof that conservati­ves don't think of EVERYONE in America as AMERICANS.  They think only THEY are right, and therefore they can just "ship everyone off" - oh, wait, that's right.  Cons have already shipped most American jobs overseas anyway!!

How'd that work out for George Bush's employment numbers?   Slowest job creation in 6 decades!!  Woo-hoo!  Way to go, cons!  See, we "libs" don't want you to leave, all we ask is that you actually accept reality, instead of making up your fantasies and lies about, well - everything­.

				The alternativ­e to unions protecting workers  is the right to work (no unions)  propaganda which guarantees a race to the bottom on wages, no benefits and no medical and more and more average American workers fighting for more and more low paying jobs.

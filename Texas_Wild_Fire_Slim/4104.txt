Too much elk-ahol?
Rescue workers had their hands full on Tuesday night when an apparently drunk moose got itself stuck in a tree in Gothenburg, Sweden. Police believe that the moose became tipsy after ingesting a few too many fermented apples.
"I thought at first that someone was having a laugh." Per Johansson, who first spotted the animal, told Swedish newspaper The Local. "Then I went over to take a look and spotted an elk stuck in an apple tree with only one leg left on the ground."
According to the newspaper, it appeared that the moose was trying to climb the trEE to reach a hanging fruit. Some animals in the region are known to get drunk during the fall on overripe fruit that fall from trees and naturally ferment on the ground.
Luckily, the emergency team managed to pull the animal out of the tree that night, giving it some time to sleep off its buzz for heading back into the woods.

This tiny porker has an excuse for making a pig of himself at mealtimes - he really does have two mouths to feed.

The bizarre two-month-old youngster - part of a litter born on a farm in Deshengtang, Jilin province, northern China - can use both his mouths to eat and appears otherwise normal, say his owners.

Farmer Li Zhenjun and his wife Yu Wanfen named the piglet Xiaobao - or 'Babe' in English - after the movie about an extraordinary talking pig.

Li explained: "The mouths aren't much of an advantage because his head is very heavy and he gets pushed around by the others."

"I'm feeding her with a bottle now and she's doing very well," he added.

				animals other than people are NOT "its".  they are "she's" or "he's".  if people refer to their inanimate, unalive stuff like motor cycles, cars, boats, air planes etc. as "she", certainly animals other than people ought to be referred to by gender.  do you call your children "its" when speaking of them to other people?  just one of my little pet peeves...

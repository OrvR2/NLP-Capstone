DHS chief: Better passenger screening in futureBy EILEEN SULLIVAN - Associated Press | AP – 17 hrs ago





WASHINGTON (AP) — Homeland Security Department Secretary Janet Napolitano predicted Tuesday that airline passengers in the future will no longer be instructed to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints, but she said the technology to scan shoe-wearing passengers for bombs does not yet exist and may not be available soon.No technology meets government standards to screen shoes for explosives at airports while passengers wear them. Officials have not been able to say for certain that this technology will exist in the future, though they are working to develop it.Removing shoes during screening has been a common complaint among airline travelers since security was increased after a member of al-Qaida tried to detonate a bomb built into his shoe aboard an American Airlines flight in December 2001.Napolitano said restrictions on carrying liquids on planes — imposed after another terrorist plot to detonate disguised bombs on board planes in August 2006 — probably will remain in effect."We'd love to have a kind of a screening portal that you just step in and, boom, it's got everything and you go through and it's painless and very, very quick," Napolitano said at a breakfast meeting organized by Politico, a Washington news organization, according to a transcript of her remarks. "The technology isn't quite there yet and it won't be for a while, but I think one of the first things you will see over time is the ability to keep your shoes on, and one of the last things you will probably see is a reduction or removing the limitation on liquids."In July, the government announced that TSA will begin testing a program this fall with a small number of travelers who volunteer personal information. If cleared, these travelers could go through security faster — in some cases, because they won't be asked to take their shoes off. But participants still might be asked to remove their shoes, TSA Administrator John Pistole told The Associated Press."It makes sense to try to identify those who are willing to share information about themselves, and if we can make some judgments about them as part of this risk-based screening initiative, then perhaps one of the benefits is they can in all likelihood keep their shoes on," Pistole said.Pistole said that TSA will always perform random and unpredictable screening, so that passengers who aren't asked to remove their shoes might be asked to remove their shoes on the next trip."Just to keep her guessing," he said. "The last thing we want to do is allow terrorists to game the system."

Thank god we have patriots like that dude Napolitano to protect us and to make smart decisions to protect our liberty. I think it's fantastic that soon we'll be able to keep our shoes on while we are strip searched. This is definitely a move in the right direction, away from that dehumanizing act of taking off our shoes before being strip searched.

Isreal doesn't make people take shoes off and limit how much fluids you can take on a carry on. After the Muslim hijackings of the 1960s and 70s, El Al has had a pretty safe track record as far as letting terrorists on board is concerned. It's because they made some hard, politically incorrect changes to their passenger screening practices. Why can't we do that? Oh, that's why, we have a dyke in charge of that now.

Appropriate responses to legitimate threats are not a problem for anyone. That is not the system and never has been. There are people who are a threat to themselves as well as others out there who need to be identified and dealt with. Not babies and old ladies. Address behavioral issues -  profile if you like to call it that. Way more relevant and effective  that will not be an afront and not insignificant intrusion to the rest of us.

All of this is just a way to keep the sheep in line and grateful they are being protected! The Military has already proven the best and most reliable way to find explosives is a DOG!!  But then, one of their buddies couldn't sell their x-ray machines! What was I thinking!! (Sorta like Cheney and Halliburton). Always getting screwed, paying big money for it and made to like it or WE will be labeled a 'terrorist'.    PSssssTTTttt

The DHS or TSA couldn't secure a cheeseburger in a sack at a fast food restaurant, much less an airline industry in the U.S.

Great, we can wear our shoes, LOL. From the title of the article, I thought they were going to stop doing such stupid things as patting down toddlers, etc. Oh well, now we have our shoes, which in reality, doesn't add or detract to anything. Adding some common sense to the DHS would help.

Comical how much we spend on shoe removal in airports thanks to one shoe-bomber>  Al Qaeda is truly bleeding America to death with terror-based knee-jerk spending on trillion dollar wars in central asia  and ridiculous security agencies that frisk grandmas and children and make us take off shoes to get on planes.  Too funny that while other countries spend on education and training to build their emodern business economy, we pay people to scan shoes for bombs and treat passengers like shit before they get on a plane.

To all the TSA agents I have dealt with, especially in Jacksonville, Florida, thanks for doing what must be a really tedious job in a friendly and efficient manner. It's sad things have come to this, but I've been surprised with how well things seem to go.

Swiss bankers group wants amicable deal in U.S. tax rowBy Emma Thomasson | Reuters – Mon, Sep 5, 2011

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland must solve a dispute with the United States over wealthy citizens using secret Swiss accounts to dodge taxes under existing laws and should continue to protect bank secrecy, the Swiss Bankers Association head said on Monday.
The association's president, Patrick Odier, made the comments after newspapers reported on Sunday the United States had given an ultimatum to Switzerland, saying Credit Suisse and nine other banks could face charges unless detailed information on U.S. tax evaders using Swiss accounts was handed over this week.
"There cannot be an ultimatum. Friendly states must have a will to negotiate," Odier told a news conference.
"I am sure that the United States understands that we are not a banana republic and that we want to defend our legal order just as America also wants to do and that is why I am hopeful that a solution is possible."
Odier said Switzerland must avoid reverting to emergency law as it did to  settle a U.S. investigation against UBS when it bent strict bank secrecy laws to reveal details of some 4,450 UBS clients to avoid criminal charges.
"Bank client secrecy protects wealth and does not hide it. This protection remains important," he said.
The United States has ratcheted up the pressure in recent months, telling Credit Suisse it is a target of a formal investigation and indicting a number of Swiss bankers, alleging they helped former UBS clients shift their assets to other Swiss banks rather than coming clean to the taxman.
A long tradition of bank secrecy has helped Switzerland build up a $2 trillion offshore financial industry, but the country has agreed in recent years to do more to help hunt tax cheats amid a global crackdown on tax havens.
DEALS WITH GERMANY, BRITAIN
Odier said an accord should be possible under the terms of the existing UBS deal and a new double taxation agreement with the United States that Switzerland approved in 2009 but is still awaiting ratification by the U.S. Senate.
"The United States should take note of the example of the tax agreements with Germany and Britain. Bilateral problems between friendly states should be able to be solved in an amicable way," Odier said.
Last month, Switzerland agreed with Germany and Britain to tax money kept by their residents in secret Swiss accounts and also introduce a withholding tax on future interest earned, a proposal rejected by Washington.
The government is keen to find a solution that would avoid needing the approval of parliament which only reluctantly agreed to the UBS treaty under emergency law last year, especially ahead of Swiss elections next month.
But the United States seems to be pushing for more than current Swiss law would allow, seeking details of all U.S. clients with accounts worth at least $50,000 between 2002 and 2010 at banks including Credit Suisse, Julius Baer and Wegelin as well as the Zurich and Basel cantonal banks.
Two Swiss Sunday papers said a letter sent by U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 31 demands detailed figures on tax evasion at Credit Suisse by Tuesday.
The SonntagsZeitung newspaper cited a banking source as saying the Swiss banks will also have to pay a fine of up to 2 billion Swiss francs ($2.6 billion).
Mario Tuor, a spokesman for the Swiss department for international financial affairs, would only say that talks are underway and that Berne wants a solution based on existing law.
Shares in Credit Suisse were down 7.6 percent by 1008 GMT, falling even further than the European banking sector which was off 5 percent after news that a U.S. regulator is suing several banks in a separate matter.
($1=0.783 Swiss francs)

The Swiss should first release all the accounts they have of US politicans, both past and present, together with the Warren Buffett and the Kennedy and Kerry family accounts, if any.

We don`t need to be telling other countrys how to run their businesses. Look at what is going on here because the gov has so much control over the private sector. Besides I don`t blame people for hiding money in their banks as all the US wants to do is rape anyone with a bank account.

people put their money in swiss banks b/c they offer a service unlike many banks. they have a reputation the money is safe. why does the U.S. government need  to know how much money someone has? if the money was made in the U.S. it was recorded somewhere. the biggest tax cheats are U.S. corporations, ex: GE which makes billions and pays ZERO taxes. Halliburton who works mainly overseas

The Swiss are friendly to anyone with gold, cash or even gold teeth just ask their buddy Adolf.  The US needs to close down Swiss bank operations within the US and restricted US bank operations  with them until they have provided information about those commiting US Tax Fraud.

The Swiss are the friends of the United States?  Funny I don't recall them fighting beside me in Vietnam or fighting beside the United States in any of our wars.  They have never done anything to show us that they are our friends.  They are; however, sheltering the hoardes of tax cheats of the United States who might be hiding the money not just for tax purposes but as ill goten money.

I could fix this starting at 7 am tomorrow morning. I'd start by slapping 2000% tariffs on all products on the shelf ready for retail, and direct Customs and Port Authority Officers to lock down any products sitting in transit at our nations ports, from said country effective immediately starting at 9 am. At 10 am I would place a call to the NASDAC and NYSE suspending all trading of any corporate assets by companies registered as doing business in said country. At 11 am I would place a call to the Federal Reserve and the SEC, directing them to freeze any and all funds owned by nationals and government agencies of said country. At 12 pm I would recall the Ambassador and all State Department personnel, and remove them by military airlift. I would ban all travel by American citizens to said country. Then I would file file a lengthy lawsuit with the WTO. Yep...long story short....problem solved.

The US has absolutely no business dictating to any country to change their laws for our convenience. The only exception to that rule is if the other country is destroying or threatning the lives or welfare of american citizens or our allies. Economic, business, or monetary laws are absolutely none of our business.

"Odier said an accord should be possible under the terms of the existing UBS deal and a new double taxation agreement with the United States that Switzerland approved in 2009 but 
is still awaiting ratification by the U.S. Senate."   They the Senete must be waiting for the election year so they can pat themselves on the back for doing something that almost appears valuable to this country, but they have to get their money out of the Swiss Banks First.

Cooperation of the Swiss isn't even needed.  Since the money was likely transferred by wire, the sending institutions in the US have records of those transfers.  Since most luggage is inspected before international flights, we should also be able to stop movement of money in the same manner that we stop the movement of explosives.   Since when has the IRS or the justice department not been able to subpiena records of expected tax evaders.   Larger impact of undisclosed depositors is the theft by dictators of the wealth of nations, stolen from their people, and deposited in "off shore" accounts including Switzerland.

I hope the Swiss hold strong to their own laws.  While most in the US are too ignorant to know it, Switzerland was the first real democracy in the world.  They are an efficient country with the strongest national defense against invasion of any country in the world.  By law, all Swiss men are armed.  They have solid employment rates, one of the best standards of living, excellent health care and very little poverty.  Oh yes, they still value education.  Until Richard Nixon changed international monetary agreements mid-stream, they had no inflation and no national debt.  There is much to be learned from that peaceful, democratic society.

Dear Switzerland;  We are speaking softly.  You don't want to see " big stick" time.

Switzerland you are a sovereign nation please act like one and tell this socialist regime to take a hike. Better yet tell them what the Texans told the Mexican army at Gonzalez when they ordered them to surrender Mexican Gov. Property in possession of the Texans (a cannon). "Come and take it" (our first battle flag in Texas)? You know what is funny though, if they do hand over the names you are going to find that the great majority of them are going to be Obama supporters (international bankers, Hollywood types, etc...). Proves the point though doesn't it, 'there's no honor among thieves'.

Maybe the US and NATO should look the other way when this country gets attacked And all its wealth looted . They live comfortably because of world protection . Maybe they need to start paying for that protection.

The Swiss Banks are facing the kiss of death if they release this information; Swiss Banks are not like their counterparts in the U.S. And the Swiss banks have been natural long before they were involved with us. If I were the Swiss Banks I'd tell the U.S. to Pound Sand, at least their Banks have not had to be bailed out by their Government because they can't count. Besides If I am not mistaken when an account is opened there are contractual agreements the bank makes that the U.S. just can't come in and tell them they have to change them for their benefit.

Oh listen to their #$%$!!  They have been safe haven for tax dodgers and criminals for hundreds of years and they want to make a deal....screw them...about the only thing this useless administration has done in 3 years....The US needs to be hard core and force them to give up the books or else prevent them from doing any business in this country...legalized criminality...that is all it is..........and they have the audacity to not call themselves a banana republic..please.

Just get back all the money Dick Cheney and his Halliburton/Black Water buddies stole and banked and we could fund a Trillion $'s worth of social programs or pay down the national debt!

It is time to end the Swiss banks license to operate in the USA.

Any American hiding money in Swiss Banks or any other offshore account thus avoiding their share of the burden of paying for George Bushs criminal war in Iraq should be treated as a financial terrorist!

Now that compinies are moving their intellectual property offshore and making royalty payments to create a non-existent expense for US IRS, where the Republicans want to give them a FREE RIDE (saying it will create jobs if they bring the money back) they need to be paying a non-deductable Royalty Tax on any payments made to a wholly or partially owned sub or parent company.

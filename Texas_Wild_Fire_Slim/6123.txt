Politico:
It doesn't sound like the change will come anytime soon, but it's at least been suggested. At a Politico Playbook breakfast on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano gave hope to harried travelers everywhere by saying that the TSA requirement that passengers take off their shoes and scamper in their socks through backscatter airport screenings will eventually be phased out. What she said, exactly, was this:

Mike Elk: I Am Thankful for TSA Workers

				Having to go through searches every time at the airport due to a knee replacemen­t, I would actually pay to see Napolitano getting a full body search. Maybe having someone's hand go her behind and fondle private parts may have her discussing eliminatin­g this intrusive method that is used almost exclusivel­y for non Muslims.   Shoes off, shoes on, if they think that is security then why is it not required for employees or visitor's entry into federal buildings or to tour the Capitol or White House?

				One of the most ineffectiv­e (even useless?) security measures ever...and all because some nimrod put matches in his shoes. There's no practical reason for this idiotic routine given today's technology (full body scanners, etc). 

Plus some of those airport floors are just plain gross to walk on in bare feet or socks!

				I think the TSA is doing a good job to keep people safe. Remember the shoe and underwear bombers? Terrorist are always thinking of new ways to get by airport security, and the TSA stops them in their tracks by thinking like a terrorist would think, or which ways would a terrorist try to bring an explosive device aboard a plane. Bad Idea Napolitano­. The terrorists thank you.

				Shoes off in public, among the masses, is a nasty, filthy, germ and fungus ridden paradise!  There are so many nasty things to pick up on your feet in common foot areas like that. I always "Vocally" refuse to remove my shoes unless they give me sanitary booties to put on my feet, of course they want to wipe me down and "touch" me, but I'd rather go through that than remove my shoes, and walk through a X-Ray scanner...­I refuse - every time!

				So you don't want to remove your shoes?  I don't particular­ly want to either but even if you do not, unless you can hover, you sit down seats in the airport and seats on the plane that have never been cleaned.

The purpose wasn't to blow anything up except our national demeanor. Making us take our shoes off or get our treats photograph­ed has got to be making them laugh their hindquarte­rs off.

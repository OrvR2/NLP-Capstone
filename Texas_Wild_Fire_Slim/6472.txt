FacebookPosted: 5:31 pm PDT September 7, 2011Updated: 9:35 pm PDT September 7, 2011CALAVERAS COUNTY, Calif. --  Fire officials say a wildfire that had come close to some homes in the Calaveras County community of Mountain Ranch is now 40 percent contained.   CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant says the blaze, reported a little after 4 p.m. Wednesday, has burned about 60 acres.   Berlant says the fire had come close to about five or six homes, but fire crews were able to keep the flames away from the homes.   Berlant could not say when the blaze would be contained, but says firefighters have stopped what he termed the "forward progression" of the fire. No homes are threatened, and there are no evacuations.   The cause of the fire is under investigation.   Mountain Ranch is small community about ten miles northeast of San Andreas, or about 75 miles southeast of Sacramento. Copyright 2011 by KTVU.com. All rights reserved.

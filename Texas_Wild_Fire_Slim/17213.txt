TTP CALLS ON ARIZONA INSTITUTE FOR CIVIL DISCOURSE TO DENOUNCE HOFFA COMMENTS





The Tucson Tea Party calls on the National Institute for Civil Discourse, also based in Tucson Arizona, to denounce the violence-inciting comments directed at Tea Party members made by Teamsters Union President Jimmy Hoffa in a speech he gave at a Labor Day campaign rally for President Barack Obama.
Hoffa said that unions need to pick fights with Tea Parties and Congressional Republicans. He further went on to say,““The war on workers, and you see it everywhere, it [sic] is the Tea Party . . .President Obama, this is your army. We are ready to march. Let’s take these son of a bitches [sic] out . . .”
Trent Humphries Organizer for the Tucson Tea Party said “If the National Institute for Civil Discourse is to have any legitimacy at all, this is the type of thing they need to focus on. By not doing so, calls into question the very reason for their existence. Either they focus on all comments, even from those they consider their political allies, or they need dispense with any claim to non-partisanship and reimburse any financial help provided by the University of Arizona.”
President Obama, who was in attendance at the Labor Day rally, spoke at a Memorial Service in Tucson after the tragic shootings of January 8th and said the following,”But at a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized - at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who think differently than we do - it's important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals, not a way that wounds.”
President Obama has had no comment on the words spoken right before he too delivered a speech.

September 26th TTP Fast and Furious Town Hall





The Tucson Tea Party will be hosting a Town Hall discussing the facts surrounding the Federal Government's "Fast and Furious" gun-running program.

We have invited Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona's 1st District, who is on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform which is investigating the "Fast and Furious" program. We will also be honored to host a well known Fast and Furious whistle blower who is helping to shine a light on ATF failures in this and other cases, and receiving endless reprisals because of it (which is why we are not pre-announcing his name publicly.) Both are very knowledgeable and well versed to speak on this issue.

Event Specifics:

Monday September 26th, 2011

6 p.m. until 8 p.m., Doors will open at 5:30 p.m.
Seating is limited and is first come first served!

CDO High School's Performance Auditorium
25 W Calle Concordia Tucson, Az 85704

This is an Arizona issue, and it is up to us to make sure that our government is held accountable. What took place was a travesty, and if we are to leave this country a better place than we found it, the details need to be drawn into the light of day.

We are continuing to invite guests and there should be other additions to this event in the coming weeks, but for now make sure to mark your calendar.

Fitzsimmons Working to Keep The Discourse Civil





On Sunday Arizona Daily Star political "cartoonist" David Fitzsimmons reiterated his dedication to maintaining civil discourse in the Old Pueblo.

See the cartoon here.

In response, here is my first attempt at cartooning. Thanks for the motivation Fitz.

TTP's facebook Page Set To Be Archived





Due to major restructuring by facebook, all large groups are set to be archived, making them functionally disabled. In order to continue our presence on Facebook and to continue to be able to notify our membership via Facebook, we have created a fan page instead.

By liking this new page you can still post comments, videos and photos on the wall. We will be able to share events and activities with you as well.

Here's the link, please share it with others:

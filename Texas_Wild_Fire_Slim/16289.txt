Bastrop fire in Texas burns 550 homes

The Bastrop fire in Texas has now burned approximately 38,000 acres and the containment increased from zero to 30 percent today. The number of structures burned, according to the National Situation Report, has changed from the earlier estimate of 600, to 550. This fire is the largest currently burning in Texas. The Southern Area’s Type 1 Red Incident Management Team will be in place early Wednesday morning, taking over from Wilder’s Texas Forest Service Type 1 Team.
We attached a map of the Bastrop fire which shows heat detected by satellites at 4:00 a.m. CT September 7. The red areas on the map show active burning, yellow is heat detected within the previous 12 hours, and black represents heat detected within the previous 24 hours. As you can see, the map shows very little fire activity within the last 12 hours. This is most likely due to some of these factors:
The wind has decreased from the 30+ mph produced by tropical storm Lee to the 5-10 mph we have seen over the last 24 hours. Even less wind, 2-10 mph, is predicted through Thursday. Wind is the primary factor that turns small fires into large conflagrations.
In some places the fire is running out of fuel, moving out of the forested areas and into agricultural areas.
More firefighting resources on the ground and in the air are fighting the fire.

The two people that died in the Bastrop fire have not been identified, except that they were not public safety personnel.
Later today we will post information about the other fires burning in Texas.

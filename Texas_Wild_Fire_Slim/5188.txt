Steve Reich pulls image of 9/11 WTC attacks from albumBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Upshot – Mon, Aug 15, 2011

(Nonesuch Records)
Steve Reich, the Pulitzer-winning American composer, has pulled the controversial artwork for his upcoming Sept. 11 memorial album.
The cover of the album, "WTC 9/11," featured an image of a plane flying into the World Trade Center. When Reich, a pioneer of minimalist classical music, unveiled the cover last month, it was immediately met with criticism.
"As a composer I want people to listen to my music without something distracting them," Reich said in a statement. "The present cover of 'WTC 9/11' will, for many, act as a distraction from listening and so the cover is being changed."
Reich -- who selected the photograph by Masatomo Kuriya for the cover--composed the three-part score with the Kronos Quartet in memory of the terror attacks. The recording includes samples of air traffic controllers, first responders and women who kept vigil over the dead.
Nonesuch Records had planned to release "WTC 911" on Sept. 6, 2011, five days before the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks. The record label will now release the album with an altered cover on Sept. 20.
"When the cover was being designed, I believed, as did all the staff at Nonesuch, that a piece of music with documentary material from an event would best be matched with a documentary photograph of that event," Reich said in a statement. "I felt that the photo suggested by our art director was very powerful, and Nonesuch backed me up. All of us felt that anyone seeing the cover would feel the same way."
Not everyone did.

Phil Kline, a fellow composer, called the original "the first truly despicable classical album cover that I have ever seen."
The 75-year-old Reich, a New Yorker who lived blocks from Ground Zero in 2001, expressed shock at the outcry.
"It stirred up an enormous controversy that I was absolutely amazed to see," Reich said in an interview published in the September issue of Limelight magazine. "I couldn't believe that people wouldn't just say, 'Well, of course, you know, we're talking about 9/11, so here's a picture of 9/11.'"
Others were surprised too. "This is a kind of image we were inundated with for weeks, months, even years after the event," Anne Midgette wrote in the Washington Post. "Newspapers and magazines and television screens and the covers of books were flooded with pictures of towers being hit, towers burning, towers falling, rescue workers with red-rimmed eyes standing numbly amid the rubble of the towers." So why, 10 years later, is this cover any different?
Reich said the controversy was stirred "mostly by people who had never heard the music," noting that the critical response to live performances of the piece -- including at New York's Carnegie Hall -- was overwhelmingly positive. "To have this reaction to the music usurped by the album cover seemed completely wrong."

It's not the first time the minimalist pioneer has approached the subject of terrorism in his music. Reich's 2006 album "Daniel Variations" is a tribute to Daniel Pearl, the American journalist who was decapitated by Islamist extremists in 2002.
It's also not the first time a musical act has faced a 9/11 cover controversy. The Coup, an Oakland, California-based rap group, was forced to pull an album cover -- even though it was designed several months before the Sept. 11 attacks -- that eerily resembled the attacks on the World Trade Center.
And a synth-pop duo called I Am the World Trade Center was browbeaten into changing its name to I Am the World shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks. They eventually changed their name back.
"I want to thank Nonesuch for backing up my original decision about the cover," Reich said. "And for backing up my decision now to change it so we can put the focus back where it belongs -- on the music."

I was a kid just after Pearl Harbor and remember those haunting images till this day...you can never forget infamy such as that and 911 images must stay in your mind lest you become too complacent. Never forget....and a tribute is just that..a tribute....if it bothers you...good...you can never permit yourself to forget!

What's wrong with the cover? It's a pretty accurate portrayal of what happened? No doubt it is painful, but I don't think in anyway insensitive, it was part of America's history, one of the saddest and most brutal moments, and we have to face it, if not then, now.

The picture, whether you like it or not, captures the tragic event that has in some way or another changed the world.Would they rather see a rose garden with some puppies and kittens frolicking in the grass.It is what it is, was what it was.I'd buy the book, unless of course they decided to change it to  appease the view of some.

I think it is disgusting.  I know that the artist wants to commemorate this sad event, but if I were him I would change it.

It's funny how only the americans are the only ones that still honestly believe a bunch of arabs were able to pull this off.....Let me explain it this way....have you noticed how the rest of the world doesn't care anymore.......That's because most of the planet has seen the footage on multiple world media station (not just american media) and actually started questioning the validity of the US's statements regarding such.  Hell this is as believeable as them actually having shot and killed Bin Laden......Funny how everyone involved in that stunt is dead as well....but I suppose arabs are responsible for that too!  Grow up america and realize that your government is the antichrist!

PS  Let the thumbs down begin!

I see nothing wrong with the album cover. It let's people see what had happened just before the Towers fell.

I watched as the Towers fell, 10 years ago, and I felt numb, as well as sad for the families of those that were stuck in the towers, as well as for those passengers on the plane that hit the towers. I felt scared, because one group of people threatened and attacked our Country and our freedom. I'm not saying that we need to forget those who had lost their lives in this gruesome and horrific senseless attack to our Country, instead those who lost their lives at the Pentagon, the field in Pennsylvania and at the World Trade Center Towers, as well as those firefighters and armed forces personal who lost their lives trying to rescue those stuck in the Towers, should be remembered as heroes, because that's what they were. Heroes.

If Pearl Harbor, the JFK Assassination, Moon Landing, and now 9/11 are all “inside job” conspiracies, then why haven’t there been any deathbed confessions? Or even posthumous confessions in writing. Perpetrators of other hoaxes have made such confessions out of guilt—because it is human nature to do so.

If the terrorists, who conspiracy theorists claim never existed, had “fabricated” identities (and nationalities), why didn’t the “conspirators” create hijackers from Iraq to garner support for the war—if the 9/11 attacks were part of a nefarious, deep-seated plan from the beginning?

If the US government were so capable of pulling off such an elaborate conspiracy, then what prevented them from simply planting WMDs in Iraq as the final stroke to their master plan; thus proving to the people that they were right all along? It would’ve been so easy, not to mention effective.

THE BBC REPORTED THAT WTC 7 COLLAPSED 20 MINUTES BEFORE IT DID. PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW THEY KNEW. ONE OF THE SO CALLED HIJACKERS PASSPORT SURVIVED THE IMPACT IN THE TWINS TOWERS, YET THE SO CALLED PLANE THAT HIT THE PENTAGON DISAPPEARED OR MELTED AND VANISHED. 184 CAMERAS SURROUNDING THE PENTAGON AND NOT ONE FOOTAGE OF A PLANE STRIKING THE BUILDING. CRAZY? YOU SHOULD BE IF YOU BELIEVE THE OFFICIAL STORY. WHY DID THE FBI NEED THE CONFISCATE ALL OF THE SURROUNDING VIDEOS FROM PRIVATE OWNERS? 2 ISRAELIS WERE ARRESTED IN A VAN FULL EXPLOSIVES THE MORNING OF THE ATTACKS, THIS STORY DISAPPEARED FROM THE MEDIA. THE 2 ISRAELIS WERE DEPORTED TO ISRAEL AND NOT CHARGE...WHY?
AMERICAN AND CANADIANS NEED TO WAKE THE HELL UP TO WHAT IS HAPPENING AND START ASKING QUESTIONS.

THE REAL SAD THING A BOUT THIS STORY IS, HOW MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT RESEARCH THE EVENT FOR THEMSELVES. THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE ISRAELIS WERE INVOLVED. EVERY ROCK YOU LOOK UNDER THERE IS A JEWISH PRESENT. FROM THE MEDIA TO THE SHIPPING COMPANY THAT HAULED AWAY THE STEEL AND RUBBLE FROM THE CRIME SENSE. THE TRUTH WILL ONE DAY SURFACE.

THE TED OLSEN STORY WAS A LIE. CELL PHONES ON AN AIRPLANE IN 2001 WAS IMPOSSIBLE. THE PHONE CALL NEVER HAPPENED, THE FBI CAME OUT IN 2006 AND SAID IT. RESEARCH IT FOR YOURSELVES. SET YOURSELF FREE, LEARN THE TRUTH.

It has been 10 years now. People should be able to face this sort of image.... I found the image to be very moving and emotional to look at. I would love to see something like that on shelves in stores. There are much worse things out there to look at in relation to 9/11 and I cannot see what is wrong with this image. By silencing this image you are silencing a peice of history. We want people to remember 9/11 and this picture is what 9/11 was... but to replace it with anything else is only going to take away from the memory of the day and push the shock and horror of that day out of our minds.

The photo has understated but valid impact without being gratuitous.   Think of the thousands of other photos we all saw that would be inappropriate.   It is about balance, and this photo strikes a balance.    It is too bad that the nattering nillies caused a cave-in by the creators.   The critics are just plain wrong.   The complainers have misguided personal issues they need to deal with.   The photo and the whole project is a respectful remembrance of those who died, and an oblique reminder of the Islamic violence and murder that continues around the world.   We all respectfully mourn while we also acknowledge the evil, and vow not to succumb to it.

SUMMARY: CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC all took a comment Judge Sonia Sotomayor made on the  role of the circuit court during a 2005 forum out of context. The context makes  clear that Sotomayor was actually explaining the difference between district and  appeals court justices, not claiming that she "believes court of appeals  justices should make policy." 
53 Comments



In reports on President Obama's 
choice of 2nd U.S. Circuit Court Judge 
Sonia Sotomayor as his nominee to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice David 
Souter, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC all took comments Sotomayor made on the role of 
the circuit court during a February 25, 2005, Duke University School of Law forum out of context. Whereas media 
figures suggested that the comments showed that Sotomayor "believes court of 
appeals justices should make policy," context makes clear that Sotomayor was 
actually explaining the difference between district and appeals court 
justices.
In fact, in the 
comments the reporters were referring to, Sotomayor was not advocating making 
policy from the bench, but responding to a student who asked the panel to 
contrast the experiences of a district court clerkship and a circuit court 
clerkship. Sotomayor said:

The saw 
is that if you're going into academia, you're going to teach, or as Judge Lucero 
just said, public interest law, all of the legal defense funds out there, 
they're looking for people with court of appeals experience, because it is -- 
court of appeals is where policy is made. And I know -- and I know this is on 
tape and I should never say that because we don't make law, I know. OK, I know. 
I'm not promoting it, and I'm not advocating it, I'm -- you know. OK. Having 
said that, the court of appeals is where, before the Supreme Court makes the 
final decision, the law is percolating -- its interpretation, its application. 
And Judge Lucero is right. I often explain to people, when you're on the 
district court, you're looking to do justice in the individual case. So you are 
looking much more to the facts of the case than you are to the application of 
the law because the application of the law is non-precedential, so the facts 
control. On the court of appeals, you are looking to how the law is developing, 
so that it will then be applied to a broad class of cases. And so you're always 
thinking about the ramifications of this ruling on the next step in the 
development of the law. You can make a choice and say, "I don't care about the 
next step," and sometimes we do. Or sometimes we say, "We'll worry about that 
when we get to it" -- look at what the Supreme Court just did. But the point is 
that that's the differences -- the practical differences in the two experiences 
are the district court is controlled chaos and not so controlled most of the 
time.

The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United 
States (2005) notes that federal appellate courts do in fact have a 
"policy making" role:

The 
courts of appeals have also gained prominence because of the substance of their 
caseload. For their first twenty five years, these courts dealt primarily with 
private law appeals. Diversity cases (suits between citizens of different 
states), bankruptcy, patent, and admiralty cases made up most of their work. 
However, as federal regulation increased, first during the Progressive Era, then 
during the New Deal, and finally during the 1960s and 1970s, the role of the 
courts of appeals changed as appeals from federal administrative agencies became 
a larger part of their caseload. Other developments that increased these courts' 
policy making importance were the increased scope of federal prosecutions, 
especially those dealing with civil rights, drugs, racketeering, and political 
corruption, increased private litigation over various types of discrimination; 
and litigation concerning aliens' attempts to gain political asylum. Also adding 
to their importance were their post 1954 use to oversee school desegregation and 
reform of state institutions such as prisons and mental hospitals, along with 
controversies like that over 
abortion.

Indeed, during the May 
26 edition of MSNBC Live, NBC News chief justice correspondent 
Pete Williams said of Sotomayor's Duke comments: "Even some conservatives and 
followers of strict constructionism have said that she was only stating the 
obvious: that trial judges, district court judges, decide only the cases before 
them, and that appeals courts, because they are the above the other courts, do 
set policy; they do make precedent that governs the other courts. So it's either 
a very controversial statement or a fairly routine one, depending on your point 
of view."
As Media Matters for America documented, Fox News host Jane Skinner 
misrepresented Sotomayor's Duke comments in a similar way during the May 7 
edition of Fox News' Happening 
Now.
From the 9 a.m. hour 
of the May 26 edition of Fox's America's 
Newsroom:

MEGYN 
KELLY (co-host): Apparently, we don't have this clip teed up -- we'll get it for 
you, and we'll play it in a minute. But what she said in this controversial 
clip, when she was speaking at Duke years ago, was that court of appeals 
justices -- that's where she sits now, the court of appeals; that's right 
underneath the Supreme Court -- make policy.
KARL ROVE 
(Fox News contributor): Right -- make law. Make 
law.
KELLY: 
She said, I know it's going to be controversial -- yeah, but -- no, she said 
make policy. We have this out? Let's play it. Let's watch. 

SOTOMAYOR 
[video clip]: All of the legal defense funds out there, they're looking for 
people with court of appeals experience, because it is -- court of appeals is 
where policy is made. And I know -- and I know this is on tape and I should 
never say that because we don't make law, I know. OK, I know. I'm not promoting 
it, and I'm not advocating it, I'm -- you know. OK. 

KELLY: 
Well, I mean, a lot of people think she was promoting it and she was advocating 
it -- 
ROVE: Sure. Absolutely.
KELLY: -- and she believes court of appeals justices should make policy or make law, 
and they would counter, "No, that's what we have elected representatives for." 
ROVE: That's right.
KELLY: But Karl, that reflects -- I admire her honesty, because that actually does 
reflect what a lot of liberal jurists feel and their approach to judging.
ROVE: 
Yeah. The conference, I think, was organized, by [Erwin] Chemerinsky, who's now 
the dean of the University of California-Irvine law school, the founding dean 
out there, and he's got a very liberal view of what it is to be a judge, and she 
participated in this conference. Yeah, look, she's at least 
honest.

From the May 26 
edition of CNN's American 
Morning:

JIM 
ACOSTA (CNN correspondent): Just a couple of quotes that are of interest that I 
think our viewers might want to know about. Our CNN political staff has put 
together some quotes from Judge Sotomayor from her past. Back in 2005 at 
Duke 
University, she was 
speaking at a panel discussion there, and she said that the appeals court is 
where policy is made and she even said during that discussion, "I know, I know 
I'm on tape. I shouldn't have said that," but that is what she believes. So 
conservatives, when they hear that, they are going to take issue with that 
statement. They believe that policy is not made on the bench; policy is made in 
the legislative branch of Congress, and that it is up to judges to decide on 
the law, not interpret or make law, and -- excuse me, not interpret but not to 
make law. And so Judge Sotomayor has made a couple of statements over the years 
that conservatives are going to have fun with. 
Earlier 
before that 2005 panel discussion, she was at a different public setting in 
which she said a judge's gender and ethnicity should be taken into consideration 
when ruling on cases, and so conservatives are going to have some fun with that 
one as well.

From the 9 a.m. ET 
hour of the May 26 edition of CNN 
Newsroom: 

ACOSTA: 
Not a big surprise -- Sotomayor has been mentioned throughout this whole process 
and had emerged as one of the leading contenders in the final days and hours of 
this selection process. And what Republicans are saying is what they have been 
saying about judicial nominees for the past several years, is they don't want to 
see what they call a judicial activist on the bench, somebody that they say 
would try to legislate, try to write law from the bench instead of interpreting 
or deciding on law as it's presented in a court setting or in a proceeding. And 
what Judge Sotomayor brings to the table here is very interesting, because she 
has made some comments in the past that conservatives can latch on to. Back in 
2004 at Duke 
University, she said that 
the appeals court is where policy is made. Well, that's going to drive 
conservatives crazy. In an earlier public setting, she said that, you know, you 
should not, as a judge, disregard your ethnicity or gender. That, too, will 
drive conservatives crazy. But, on the other hand, what the White House will 
say, what their political allies will say on Capitol Hill is that, look, Judge 
Sotomayor was put on the bench originally by a Republican president, George H.W. 
Bush. And Republicans will say, "Oh, well, what about David Souter?" George H.W. 
Bush put David Souter on the bench. 
But, you 
know, you have to keep in mind, not only are we talking about the first Hispanic 
judge on the Supreme Court -- justice on the Supreme Court, we're also talking 
about a woman, and there are a number of female Republican senators who might 
find it very hard to vote against judge Sotomayor. Olympia Snowe and Susan 
Collins, two very moderate Republicans from Maine, are going to be tempted to go along 
with the Democrats on this nomination. And even over the weekend, Jon Kyl, the 
number-two Republican in the Senate, was saying on one of the Sunday talk shows 
that they pretty much don't have the votes to block this nomination. And as 
Jeffrey Toobin and Alan Dershowitz have said on this network earlier this 
morning, there really aren't any red flags, any known red flags about this 
justice at this point that would warrant a huge fight on Capitol Hill. 

HEIDI 
COLLINS (anchor): Yeah, yeah. But you did bring up something that I think we're 
going to hear a lot more about, those comments made in that panel discussion at 
Duke University. I have some of it here in front of me. To go further than what 
you said here about the court of appeals being where policy is made. She said, 
according to this, "Because it is the court of the appeals is where policy is 
made. I know this is on tape and I should never say that, because we don't make 
law, I know. I'm not promoting it and I'm not advocating it." It goes on to say 
a couple more things here. But I think we're going to hear a lot more about 
that. 

ACOSTA: 
Yeah, that's right. But having said all of that, Mr. Obama was under a lot of 
pressure from liberals to put somebody on the bench that they could like, and, 
you know, somebody who has made those sort of pugnacious comments in public 
settings is going to be very appealing on the left side of the political 
spectrum. There are going to be those out there on the liberal side who have 
been somewhat disappointed with President Obama in the early months of his 
administration because of issues like Guantánamo, that they feel like President 
Obama is not exactly doing what he said out on the campaign trail that made him 
so appealing to liberals. And when they hear Judge Sotomayor making comments 
like that, they're thinking, "Well, maybe this is somebody who can go toe-to-toe 
with a Justice Scalia or Justice Roberts or Justice Alito." Two very, very 
conservative justices on the Supreme Court. And what liberals have been wanting 
is somebody who can go toe-to-toe with those sort of 
justices.

From the 10 a.m. ET 
hour of the May 26 edition of MSNBC Live:

CHRIS 
MATTHEWS (MSNBC's Hardball host): 
Let's go to some of the possible flash points. She's been quoted as saying the 
Supreme Court -- well, let's say this, the court of appeals right below it -- 
is, quote, "where policy is made." Let's start with that. Doesn't that rankle 
the original-intent folks who think the Constitution should be read literally 
and we shouldn't look for policy to be made on the bench? 

SAVANNAH 
GUTHRIE (NBC News correspondent): We will hear that clip played over and over 
and over again in the coming weeks, and conservatives will point to it as 
evidence that Sotomayor is an activist judge, and that she was committing truth 
when she said that courts of appeal judges are those who set policy. Now, it 
should be said as soon as she said it, she kind of joked and said, "Well, I'm 
going to get in trouble for that." So look, they will say that means she's 
results-oriented. She's got other controversial statements in her background, 
where she talks about why being a Latina, one might come to a better conclusion 
than a white male judge, for example, but she also has, at the same time, said 
it's not just those qualities that will mean someone renders a good decision but 
that all of it informs the decision-making. But I think that's why -- to go back 
to where we started, Chris -- why some would regard this as a less safe pick, a 
little bit more controversial, because there are those statements out there. 

[...]
WILLIAMS: 
Even some conservatives and followers of strict constructionism have said that 
she was only stating the obvious: that trial judges, district court judges, 
decide only the cases before them, and that appeals courts, because they are the 
above the other courts, do set policy; they do make precedent that governs the 
other courts. So it's either a very controversial statement or a fairly routine 
one, depending on your point of 
view.

From the Duke University panel discussion (beginning at 
approximately 40:00):

CARLOS 
LUCERO (judge, 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals): I think that the district 
court clerk and the circuit court clerk really do substantially similar work, 
but the work is worlds apart. As a district court clerk, we're in the middle of 
a trial, a motion is filed during the litigation, the judge has to rule on it 
the next morning. He's taken it under advisement. And the clerk is asked to do a 
memo that night on the evidentiary issue involved. It's a quick but thorough 
memo. The next day, a clerk in some other city -- the judge may ask for a memo 
on a motion for summary judgment, and the motion is very fact-dependent. It 
requires going through a lot of the supporting affidavits in support of a 
motion, and the judge wants a summary of the evidentiary issues presented. She 
might want that tomorrow, or she may want it a week later, and the clerk has to 
prepare that memo. The circuit clerk, on the other hand, is going to look at the 
issue somewhat more abstractly -- how, in a context of 30 cases, will our ruling 
on this particular motion impact other cases coming before the court. And so, 
you can see that the focus immediately is somewhat more global in its 
application, whereas this -- the district court clerk's responsibility's kind of 
more case-dependent, fact-dependent to that particular case. If you're going 
into litigation, I think that the district court clerkships are far superior to 
the circuit court clerkships, in the sense that the circuit clerks' only 
exposure to the litigation is by reading the cold record. The district court 
clerk has been there, done that, watched the good lawyers, watched the great 
lawyers, watched the mediocre lawyers, and all the while during a year of 
exposure to the practices is learning how not to do it as well as how to do it. 
On the other hand, for the circuit court clerks, those clerks generally tend to 
gravitate a little more to the academy, a little bit more to the public policy 
side of things, and they too play an important role. And I am not here to judge 
as between the two -- between the two experiences; I think it really depends on 
what you want out of your career. If, in your heart of hearts, you really want 
to be that crack litigator, the crack prosecutor, the crack -- not the crack 
public defender, but the hotshot in any of those departments, I think that 
district court clerkship is right where I would go.
SOTOMAYOR: I -- from 
my answer earlier, I don't -- doing either is going to get you a whole lot, so 
you don't make a mistake in whatever choice you make. But there is a choice. The 
saw is that if you're going into academia, you're going to teach, or as Judge 
Lucero just said, public interest law, all of the legal defense funds out there, 
they're looking for people with court of appeals experience, because it is -- 
court of appeals is where policy is made. And I know -- and I know this is on 
tape and I should never say that because we don't make law, I know. OK, I know. 
I'm not promoting it, and I'm not advocating it, I'm -- you know. OK. Having 
said that, the court of appeals is where, before the Supreme Court makes the 
final decision, the law is percolating -- its interpretation, its application. 
And Judge Lucero is right. I often explain to people, when you're on the 
district court, you're looking to do justice in the individual case. So you are 
looking much more to the facts of the case than you are to the application of 
the law because the application of the law is non-precedential, so the facts 
control. On the court of appeals, you are looking to how the law is developing, 
so that it will then be applied to a broad class of cases. And so you're always 
thinking about the ramifications of this ruling on the next step in the 
development of the law. You can make a choice and say, "I don't care about the 
next step," and sometimes we do. Or sometimes we say, "We'll worry about that 
when we get to it" -- look at what the Supreme Court just did. But the point is 
that that's the differences -- the practical differences in the two experiences 
are the district court is controlled chaos and not so controlled most of the 
time. You are jumping from one project to another at a million miles an hour on 
a given day. I explained to one on my friends that after a day in the district 
court, I actually didn't have a headache, I had a head strain. My brain in my 
first year felt that it had expanded past its capacity as a muscle to stretch. 
There was so much influx of information and new knowledge that I literally had a 
headache.
LUCERO: 
Don't hold her too responsible on physiological matters. 

SOTOMAYOR: Yeah. At 
any rate, you jump from one emergency to another. By definition, you can't ever 
pay enough attention to anything, like you would like, and you have to move 
quickly. If you have a personality where you can do that, it's stimulating 
beyond belief. I have had law clerks when I was a district court judge for whom 
that process was just shattering because their ability to respond quickly was 
limited. You have to look within yourself and see if you can do it. Because if 
you can't, it can be a horrifically draining experience. The court of appeals is 
more contemplative, so you have more time to think and you have to think more 
deeply. But with it comes the requirement of thinking on levels, on multilevels, 
at a time. And some people are not suited to that either. Some people like a 
more direct, linear process, and the district court is better for that. As I 
said, there's no right and wrong, other than your choice. You're sort of looking 
at yourself seeing where your personality fits and thinking about your career 
choices and seeing which might be better. Now you could do both. So -- but 
that's not so easy either.

                    It is amazing that you MMFA nuts will jump on any offhanded comment by any conservative out there and attack it until you are red in the face.  Yet, a liberal gets attacked because of something she said and she is being "misrepresented".  What a joke of an organization this is.

                    It was misrepresented if you read the article. They are actually saying that Sotomayor believes that appeals courts make policy when in fact she didn't.

You can't dispute this, so you make a baseless accusation, as per usual.

                    It is amazing how you dimocrats don't comprehend what she actually said. She said it, no one put the words in her mouth. And now with another comment, she is showing that she may very well be a racist. She is perfect for the liberal movement, another hypocrite.

                    You're a little late to the game and you didn't bring any new toys. If you don't consider what else Sotomayor said, or what she was talking about when she said it, then yes, you could easily be led to believe that the cropped quotes are the whole meaning she intended. But you would have to ignore the information you've been presented with to believe that. Hey, are you a Bush administration official, by any chance?

                    Normally I would defer to your judgement about being an idiot. What with the vast experience you have with living your life as, well, YOU. That SHOULD make you an expert on being an idiot. In this case however it also explains your inability to understand pretty much anything so I wont bother trying to beat another Q-tip into another anvil.

                    Here is another of her comments that I am sure was "misrepresented."

"I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."

                    Thomas Jefferson was such a jerk:

"Tyrrany needs to gain a foothold."

"Force is the vital principle."

"I have sworn...eternal hositlity against every...man."

"I hope we shall crush...our country."

Can you believe that guy said those things?

If a quote seems damning, just go ahead and use it. Don't stop to consider what Sonia Sotomayor might have been talking about when she said it. Obviously, MMFA's readers aren't smart enough to see through THAT.

                    I just hope they look into why Sotomayor acted the way she did in response to the New Haven firefighters case.  The American people have a right to know why Sotomayer embraced the decision of a lower court but declined to issue a detailed rule.  Other than that, Sotomayer look good so far.  We might want to see if she was an affirmative action selection when entering Princeton too.  Princeton is notorious for that sort of thing.  You know, whites need a 4.0 GPA but someone like Sotomayer could squeeze in with a 3.1 to fill a quota.

                    I don't like the idea of legacy students either.  All I know is I worked my behind off in high-school, had above a 4.0 and excellent SAT scores but yet Princeton, Harvard and Yale all denied me admission.  Luckily, I was able to go to Berkeley or Stanford (I chose Berkeley).  So yeah, I guess I am a little bitter toward special treatment.  Don't even get me started on the athletes that get in because they can catch a football.

                    And yet you dialed in on affirmative action.  I think that speaks volumes.

                    That is because of leadership like Condolezza Rice.

You FANTASIZING accomplishments she had nothing to do with says a lot about you. Sotomayer isnt racist because you are brainwashed and dont know what you are talking about.

                    You just diminish her because she was once a dimocrat, Jimmy Carter cured her of that. And by the way she was a professor of political science in addition to her responsibilities as Provost.The first woman, first minority and youngest ever at Stanford. And under her leadership, the Stanford budget deficit was turned into a surplus. 
  Time magazine has thought enough of her to list her as one of the most influential people 4 times, one of only 4 people in history to be named as such.

                    I am not diminishing her at ALL. Even if she IS a RepubliSCUM. She is very accomplished. You have never seen me diminish her other than pointing out her many LIES in service to the Bush administration. Other than that lying for Bush thing which was part of her job I have nothing but respect for her intelligence and accomplishments.  Saying Stanford is a great university because of her leadership is ludicrous. It was a great university before she was BORN.

                    No you did diminish her by claiming all she did was take care of the budget, as if that was not an important factor in running the institution. 

And they are a great university because they have a history of excellent professors, of which she was one. A great organization of any kind does not remain great unless they maintain that standard. She carried on that tradition and in addition straightened out their finances and was an academic administrator as well.

                    No I didnt say that is all she did. I said I am sure she did a great job taking care of the budget. I wasnt being facetious.  I am also sure she was an excellent professor. No question she is a smart lady. Niether of those is leadership that MADE Stanford great. We dont seem to be really at odds here. I am not denigrating Rice as a teacher OR administrator. As long as we are agreed that Stanford has been a great university for a LOOOOOONG time. That it isnt RICE that made it a great university. I have no argument at all that she is an accomplished administrator and professor.

We might want to see if she was an affirmative action selection when entering Princeton too. Princeton is notorious for that sort of thing. You know, whites need a 4.0 GPA but someone like Sotomayer could squeeze in with a 3.1 to fill a quota. 

WHY???? 

Sotomayor graduated as valedictorian of her class at Blessed Sacrament and at Cardinal Spellman High School in New York. She received a SCHOLARSHIP to Princeton where she graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, in 1976. She was a co-recipient of the M. Taylor Pyne Prize, the highest honor Princeton awards to an undergraduate. 

It appears that however Sotomayer  was MORE than qualified to attend Princeton, no matter how she got there!!!!

It appear YOU ASSume that because she's Hispanic, she must have gotten into Princeton on affirmative action, thereby leaving some poor white soul out in the cold. 

YOU need to check yourself!

                    I believe that you are correct about Sotomayor but I can understand how the other poster misjudged her when one considers her approval of the reverse discrimmination in the Hartford case. 
 It was pointed out today also that she is very tough on crime and if her 2 unfortunate statements , one about policy making and one that makes her appear to be racist. do not come back to bite her, she may make a fine justice.

Misjudged? 

ASSume is the correct word. He ASSumed that because she was Hispanic and attended Princeton, she must be an affirmative action student. He further ASSumed that because she was an affirmative action student, she must have a lower GPA than other white students. ASSuming was the problem.

YOU call it "her approval of reverse discrimination" because YOU think the firefighters are correct. It's just YOUR opinion, which is why we have courts and judges. 

In the New Haven case, Sotomayor and the two other judges on the 2nd Circuit panel that heard the appeal waived restrictions on the length of legal briefs and time allotted for oral argument. In an apparent measure of the significance of the case, the parties were permitted to submit 86-page briefs and an 1,800-page appendix. They were given an hour to argue.

Waiving restrictions on the length of legal briefs and time allotment for oral arguments shows how serious Sotomayor and her fellow judges were about their decision. Just because she didn't rule as you would like DOES NOT diminish her years of hard work or her competence as a judge. 

one that makes her appear to be racist.

WHAT in her statement makes her racist?

                    WHAT in her statement makes her racist? 
The racist reference comes from her other statement....."I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."
If a white male made the same type of statement he would immediately be branded both a racist and sexist to boot, it seems some have different standards when she speaks in that manner. 

And the New Haven case is wrong because it denied the promotions to the best candidates and she was in favor of that decision. If I ever need the services of the fire dept , or police for that matter, I want the best, not the most racially diverse, that is meaningless. 

Denying advancement to the best applicants does not erase injustices of the past, it just creates new injustices. When will we correct those?

                    She was talking about specific cases that involve discrimination.  FL, have you ever been discriminated against because of your race where the other race was in a position of majority and power?  If not, do you think that someone who has been in that position is more qualified to discuss that issue than you are?

                    I'm STILL not sure why you have a problem with what she said. 

I could also say "I would hope that a wise African American woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."  You cannot compare the life experiences of an African American or Hispanic woman to white males. White men have NEVER face the kind of discrimination that woman of color have, period. And while I'm sure they can sympathise, they still haven't experienced it first hand.

There was a show on television a while back, where African American families and white families changed color, with the help of make up, and experienced living life as a  different race. I remember the white families commenting on the amount of discrimination they received because they were African American. The phrase, "walk a mile in MY shoes" come to mind.

And as far as New Haven? 

I STILL don't have a problem with Judge Sotomayor's ruling. And unless the Supreme Court rules 9 to 0 against Sotomayors ruling, there will be other justices who agree with her as well. 

HERE ARE THE FACTS:
In 2003, the city of New Haven sought to fill captain and lieutenant vacancies in the fire department by administering written and oral promotional exams to incumbent firefighters. The city administered the captain exam to 41 incumbent firefighters, including 25 white firefighters, 8 African-American firefighters, and 8 Hispanic firefighters. Based on the test results, no African-Americans and at most two Hispanics would be eligible for promotion to captain. 

The lieutenant promotional exam resulted in a similarly stark disparate impact. The city administered the lieutenant exam to 77 incumbent firefighters, including 43 white firefighters, 19 African-American firefighters, and 15 Hispanic firefighters. Based on the test results, no minorities would be eligible for promotion to lieutenant

Due to concerns that the promotional exams discriminated on the basis of race in violation of the law, the city held public hearings on the issue of whether to certify the test results. The city considered whether the exams were sufficiently related to the positions in question. Several New Haven firefighters testified that some of the questions were not relevant to the knowledge or skills necessary for the positions. The city also heard evidence as to whether fairer, more effective tests were available. Testing experts testified that other types of exams would not be expected to result in such a stark disparate impact. Testing experts also opined that alternative testing procedures could better identify the best potential supervisors for the fire department. These experts testified that “assessment center processes” and “situation judgment tests” can provide better alternatives to traditional written and oral tests. Ultimately, the city declined to certify the test results and sought to explore less discriminatory alternatives to the exams that were administered in 2003.

                    I read Sotomayor's statement and it seems entirely reasonable, even obvious, to me: At the Appellate level, your decisions do not affect just the case before you but can affect a whole range of similar cases across the circuit.

That is making policy. Judicial policy as opposed to political policy, that is, relating to how courts in the circuit will interpret the law and/or principles involved, but making policy nonetheless. It's a natural outgrowth of the structure of our judicial system. Her statement is so straightforward that it can only become "controversial" either by willful ignorance or willful distortion.

Sotomayor was stating the obvious...

Of course there are going to be a few right wingnuts--who know next to nothing about the law or constitutional issues--who are going to cherry pick and distort to smear her.

Conservatives just can't stop the lying.  It's reflex now.

                    LarryE,

I am not a legal expert but it seems to me that taking into account anything other than the law is judicial activism and the setting of policy.  That runs counter to what seems pretty clear in our Constitution and most of our history.

Of course judicial decisions have policy implications, but in my opinion, the policy ramifications should be left up to the legislative and executive branches. 

Unfortunately that does not seem to be the case as far too many decisions seem to based, not on the law, but on issues incidental to the law.

See THAT is the thing. It is what she is saying. It in NO WAY runs counter to our constitution that judges, while judging law and the constitution end up having policy implications. It in fact is what the judicial branch is TASKED to do especially at the Appellate and Supreme Court level.

                    The part we disagree with is her comment, which she said she shouldn't have made, illustrates her belief in judicial activism over and above judging cases based on the law.

Sonia Sotomayor said, "Court of appeals is where policy is made. And I know – and I know this is on tape and I should never say that because we don't make law, I know. OK, I know. I'm not promoting it, and I'm not advocating it, I'm – you know. OK. Having said that, the court of appeals is where, before the Supreme Court makes the final decision, the law is percolating – its interpretation, its application."

Most conservatives believe the job of an appelate court judge should be to interpret tht law, according to previous laws and decisions in accordance with the Constitution, not set policy. The court's job is to correct decisions improperly made at the lower level or if the lower level decision was correct, to affirm that the proper decision was made. 

The policy implications are just that. Implications.  It is not for the appellate court to 'make policy'. That is for the other branches.  Sotomayer revealed her judicial philosophy with her utterance and she realized as she said it that while she can 'set policy', it is not the role of the appellate court or for that matter, the Supreme Court. 

Sotomayer is not alone. Many judges on the Supreme Court and many in the appellate courts believe the same thing.  The problem is that by setting policy these judges feel they know better than the electorate how issues that should be decided by the electorate, should be decided.

                    You are just wrong. She knows she shouldnt say it because it is impolitic. It is however obvious truth. When Miranda came down and the court said a suspect has a RIGHT to hear they have a right to remain silent. That SET POLICY. A policy which was later upheld by a completely different SC. When the court ruled that Texas sodomy law was unconstitutional it meant Texas could no longer enforce that law that IS setting policy it is also the very FUNCTION of the court. Conservatives might not like it but it is the very task the constitution ITSELF gives such courts

What did you think of the opinion yesterday regarding confessions?  Was that judicial activism by the majority?  It certainly changes things dramatically and is a huge departure from precedent.  Is it activism in your mind?

                    Misinformation is what you people put forth. When she said it was the courts who make policy it was not taken out of context. Only liberal democrats and other idiots would  believe any of your tripe. As of today millions of people have heard her on tape as she joked about it being on tape. She said she shouldn't say that they make policy but they do.

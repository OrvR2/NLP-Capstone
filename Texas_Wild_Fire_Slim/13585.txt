Pennsylvania Rule Change by GOP May Doom Obama
State may switch from winner-take-all in Electoral College

(Newser) -
                                    Pennsylvania Republicans are proposing a radical change in how the state divvies up its electoral votes that could have a huge impact on the 2012 election. The plan, which is being championed by Senate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi and already has the governor’s support, would switch Pennsylvania from a...

Look Out Democrats, 2012 Is Looking Like 2010
That could be bad news in the Senate: Nate Silver

(Newser) -
                                    It can be dangerous to draw broad conclusions from special elections, but  last night's results  from New York and Nevada make it safe to say that "the special election scorecard is starting to look pretty ominous for Democrats," writes Nate Silver at the  New York Times .

Jon Stewart Slams CNN's 'Amerigasm'
Was that a debate, or a reality show?

(Newser) -
                                    Monday night's GOP debate started off in "fine reality show style," noted Jon Stewart  last night , offering up as proof a clip of CNN's opening, in which the network actually assigned each candidate a title. (Mitt Romney is "the early frontrunner," Rick Perry "...

Defensive posture serving Romney well, Aaron Blake writes

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann have shot out of the gate in the GOP nomination contest, but “sometimes it’s slow-and-steady that gets it done,” writes Aaron Blake of the  Washington Post , and if there’s one thing Mitt Romney’s proven so far, it’s that he’...

Debate Winners: Romney, Bachmann, Tea Party
Rick Perry-bashing pays off for rivals

(Newser) -
                                    It was "attack Rick Perry night" at last  night's GOP debate in Florida -—to the extent that even Jon Huntsman got in on the act—and the Texan's rivals succeeded in landing a few blows. Mitt Romney, who wisely ignored the Tea Party debate audience to...

(Newser) -
                                    Tim Pawlenty might think Mitt Romney's  the guy for the job, but Rick Perry just scored a key endorsement of his own in his quest to be president: Louisiana Gov.

We must admit the program is a problem, he writes

(Newser) -
                                    Many pundits are saying Rick Perry’s  views on Social Security  could be his biggest problem as he campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination, but the Texas governor isn’t backing down.

Perry Living High on the (Donors') Hog
Lives the high life—but you wouldn't know it listening to him

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry may play up his modest background, but these days he’s living in the lap of luxury—with a little help from his friends. Donors pay for the mansion he rents from the state for $10,000 a month—and they’ve covered worldwide travel, resort visits, top-tier...

(Newser) -
                                    As she  struggles to stay relevant  in the 2012 presidential race, Michele Bachmann has figured out at least one more way to keep her name in the news.

Critics agree: GOP debate confirmed she's just an 'afterthought' now

                                    If the fat lady didn’t quite sing for Michele Bachmann at last night’s debate, she at least hummed a few notes, say the critics:   It was “remarkable” to see this once-top-tier candidate “relegated to an afterthought, getting barely as much face time as Herman Cain, Rick ...

(Newser) -
                                    Richard Cohen spent his Labor Day hobnobbing around the Hamptons, that magical place where, in his description, "the Democratic energy, money, and intellectual firepower of Manhattan goes for R&R." It may not be the vacation destination of the working-man Democratic base, he acknowledges, but it's a...

(Newser) -

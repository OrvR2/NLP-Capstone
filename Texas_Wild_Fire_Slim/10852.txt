Boys hit by train while lying on tracks


Tweet


















  
Eagle Staff Report
Two teenage boys from Milam County remained hospitalized Monday with serious injuries after they were hit by a train while lying on the tracks. 
Chief Deputy Chris White with the Milam County Sheriff's Office said a search for the teenagers, 16 and 17, began Saturday after staff at Resolution Ranch -- a facility for "troubled teenage boys" -- reported they had run away. 
They were spotted by deputies on foot Sunday evening but were able to get away by running into a heavily wooded area, authorities said. 
Around 3:30 a.m. Monday, White said, railroad officials called the sheriff's office to report a train traveling in the Gause area had hit two people on the tracks.
After deputies located the teens, both were taken by helicopter to Scott & White in Temple. 
Because their names have not been released, hospital officials could not disclose the teens' conditions or other information about them.

Rising death toll in Texas wildfires

2011-09-07: 
					 BASTROP, Texas — One of the most devastating wildfire outbreaks in Texas history left more than 1,000 homes in ruins Tuesday and stretched the state's firefighting ranks to the limit, confronting Gov. Rick Perry with a major disaster at home just as the GOP presidential contest heats up. More than 180 fires have erupted in the past week across the rain-starved Lone Star State, and nearly 600 of the homes destroyed since then were lost in one catastrophic blaze in and around Bastrop, near Austin, that raged out of control Tuesday for a third day. Whipped into an inferno by Tropical Storm Lee's winds...

Test drive of new song 'Quelle Surprise' live from The Warehouse, Houston, Texas on the 18th March 2011. (Edited by Rou) For those complaining about the sound quality, it was recorded with a tiny mic on top of a camera. What do you expect? This isn't a music video... this isn't a professionally shot live video, there was no budget for this... This is us playing a new song and recording it so everyone can at least have some idea of what it's going to be like. This is DIY. Deal with it. Rou

DemocracyNow.org - Republican Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is expected to announce his entry into the 2012 presidential race. Perry will make the announcement at a conference in South Carolina organized by Erick Erickson's RedState.com. Early backers of Perry's presidential run have heralded him as being behind the so-called Texas economic miracle, however many have questioned Perry's economic claims in Texas. Questions have also arisen over Perry's close ties to the radical-wing of the Christian evangelical movement. Last Saturday, Perry helped organize and spoke at a controversial seven-hour Christian prayer rally in Houston titled, "The Response: A Call to Prayer for a Nation in Crisis." While the prayer session drew 30000 participants and received national press, little attention was paid to the Christian evangelicals Perry worked with to organize the event. The Texas Observer has just published an explosive article titled, "Rick Perry's Army of God." It exposes how a group of radical Christians and self-proclaimed prophets from a little-known movement known as New Apostolic Reformation have been quietly pushing for Perry's presidential bid. Democracy Now! interviews The Texas Observer's reporter, Forrest Wilder.

Pop Pilgrims - Austin: The Texas Chain Saw... family restaurant?

Author: theavclub


People typically chuckle when they hear the Texas Chain Saw Massacre house is now a restaurant, and with good reason: The site of one of the most grotesque, unnerving dinner scenes in horror-movie history now serves up (non-human) meat in a dining room that's homey, not horrifying. Well, not everyone chuckles: As owner Jeremy Lee explains in this episode of Pop Pilgrims, he receives the occasional e-mail from people who think the house was the site of actual murders. Those people are mistaken, but not necessarily crazy; the text underneath the title on the original movie poster certainly hinted at reality—"What happened is true. Now the motion picture that's just as real"—and elements of Leatherface's character were inspired by real-life serial killer Ed Gein. At the top of texaschainsawmassacre.net—the comprehensive fan site run by Pop Pilgrims guest Tim Harden—there's a giant link at the top of the home page saying "DID THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE REALLY HAPPEN? Click HERE to find out!" The link leads to a page with a long explanation best summarized by the word "No." Regardless, it's a little silly to believe The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was real. The house from the movie that caused so much controversy upon the film's release four decades ago is a local landmark in Kingsland, Texas, about an hour northwest of Austin. There's a plaque out front, and a life-sized Leatherface mannequin in Junction House's upstairs bar (along with a pack of Texas Chain Saw Massacre chili <b>...</b>

Stevie Ray Vaughan - Texas Flood (Long version!)

Order: Reorder
Duration: 9:35
Published: 2007-03-26
Author: gabriel94170


( www.youtube.com ) Long version of Texas Flood by stevie ray vaughn ! Texas Flood is an electric blues album by blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan and his band Double Trouble, released in 1983. Although "Texas Flood" has three verses of lyrics, the song is more of a prolonged guitar solo, allowing Vaughan to show off his characteristic electric blues style. During live shows, he would often play portions of this song behind his back, arousing an enthusiastic crowd response. Stylistically, "Texas Flood" is structured around the common three chord blues progression. Written and performed in the key of G (sounding F# because of Vaughan's tuning), it is in 12/8 time, or compound time[1], which gives it a "slow burning" feel that is common in Texas blues. en.wikipedia.org

Author: traynickel


More NEWS at www.newzzcafe.com A little-known Texas law and a foreclosure could have a man in Flower Mound living on Easy Street. Flower Mound's Waterford Drive is lined with well-manicured $300000 homes. So, when a new neighbor moved in without the usual sale, mortgage-paying homeowners had a few questions. "What paperwork is it and how is it legally binding if he doesn't legally own the house?" said Leigh Lowrie, a neighboring resident. "He just squats there." Lowrie and her husband said the house down the street was in foreclosure for more than a year and the owner walked away. Then, the mortgage company went out of business. Apparently, that opened the door for someone to take advantage of the situation. But, Kenneth Robinson said he's no squatter. He said he moved in on June 17 after months of research about a Texas law called "adverse possession." "This is not a normal process, but it is not a process that is not known," he said. "It's just not known to everybody." He says an online form he printed out and filed at the Denton County courthouse for $16 gave him rights to the house. The paper says the house was abandoned and he's claiming ownership. "I added some things here for my own protection," Robinson said. The house is virtually empty, with just a few pieces of furniture. There is no running water or electricity. But, Robinson said just by setting up camp in the living room, Texas law gives him exclusive negotiating rights with the original owner.

'Papers please' for reporter at Texas capitol shooting investigation

Author: TheAlexJonesChannel


www.infowars.com Like other reporters in the Austin-area, the Infowars team was immediately sent to the Texas Capitol building on news that a man, identified as Fausto Cardenas, had started shooting for no apparent reason. There wasn't much else to discover once we got there. The suspect had apparently harmed no one and State Troopers were quietly combing over the South steps with their investigation. I had catalogued everything going on behind the roped-off area and wandered around the other side of the Capitol to film another grouping of troopers who were combing the grounds with a (presumab 3:59 PM(presumably bomb-sniffing) dog. When a trooper noticed me filming their quiet investigation, everything suddenly changed. Though the building itself was closed, the Capitol grounds remained open, and people were milling about freely. Only the area immediately surrounding the South steps was restricted by yellow tape. Yet this officer approached me sternly, pointing his finger and commanding that I 'point the camera somewhere else' and provide ID. I refused. For those who have forgotten, in the haze of post-9/11 paranoia, America is not a 'papers please' dictatorship or a corrupt banana republic, even if certain forces are might attempt to drag us in that direction. So why did this officer feel the need to rush up and demand I justify myself? Were I suspected of a crime as benign as speeding such action might have been warranted, but I had literally done nothing but look in <b>...</b>

We may forward your contact information and inquiry to our affiliates and other divisions of our company that we feel can best address your inquiry or provide you with the requested service. We may also use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, agents and partners.
We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.
In addition, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request.

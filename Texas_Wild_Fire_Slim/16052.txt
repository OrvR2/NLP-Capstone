What to Snag (and What to Skip) at GapKaboodle – Wed, 7 Sep, 2011 11:31 AM EDT

Gap can be a hard nut to crack—it’s usually on trend and sometimes it even teams up with high-end designers for special one-of-a-kind collections. But is the retail fashion chain where you should buy your three or four trendy pieces for the season or should you just play it safe with their go-to jeans and classic button ups? Here we reveal what to snag and what to skip during your next shopping spree at Gap.

What to Snag
1) Denim, Denim, Denim
 
 
1969 mid-weight high-rise legging jeans
 
 
They’ve made great jeans for years—and when it comes to denim that fits well, Gap is still at the head of the class. With constantly updating styles and washes, it’s a great one-stop shop for your denim needs this fall. Our favorite fit? Their boot cut styles.
They fit well and don’t break the bank. Also, don’t forget to try on a pair of their new high-rise jeggings.

2) The Classic White Button Up
 
 
The perfect shirt in optic white
 
 
If there’s one thing Gap does well, it’s classic staples—and the white button up is their crown jewel. And even though they’ve nailed it, each season they throw in a few twists—adding ruffles here or ribbons there. This fall, we’re liking their tie-neck shirt.

3) Tanks & Tees
 
 
Ribbed tank
 
 
It’s true: you can buy tank tops and T-shirts at almost every store in the mall. But Gap separates itself from the pack with its huge selection of styles and colors and their noticeably better quality. Our favorite is the ribbed tank in black. Best part? They’re constantly on sale online!

4) Hats & Scarves
 
 
Asymmetrical fedora
 
 
Yes, we’re being serious. Ever since Gap’s wildly successful ad campaigns featuring brightly colored scarves and sweaters, they’ve been a player in the accessory space—and this season is no different. With super cute floppy hats and fedoras plus a large selection of pretty scarves, this is the place to start preparing for the snow.

What to Skip
While Gap does classic pieces better than almost everyone, they aren’t the greatest at capturing the latest trends. Here’s what to avoid during your next shopping trip at Gap:

1) Leather Goods
While belts might be fine, larger leather items,  particularly skirts and dresses, don’t seem to be made of the best quality materials.  

2) Jewelry
When was the last time you complimented someone’s jewelry and they said, “Thank you! I got it at Gap!” Exactly. Don’t bother with Gap’s jewelry section.

3) Heels
Yes, Gap makes solid flip flops and ballet flats, but when it comes to heels, it’s best to stick to Nine West or even Gap’s sister brand, Piperlime.

I hate to say this but as a guy I have found Wal-Mart to be better than most of these mid level stores like the Gap.  I bought  a really nice pair of shoes -  fit like a glove - so comfortable and way better made than a pair of shoes I bought at Aldo which were double the price.  Same for shirts - nicely made dress shirts for 1/3 to 1/4 what the Bay charges.  ones New York shirts I bought were total crap at nearly $60 each.  Started falling apart after one wash.  I suppose rich people only wear things once anyway but man.

Walmart stuff may be made in sweatshops overseas - but places like the Gap do the exact same thing but charge 3 times more for it.

I buy from the Gap occasionally from time to time but it's not my shop-to-be. The really cool shirts I bought kind of stretched a lot and I bought them for the small size....gosh....i won't buy that again!

Want your share of all the bailout money from these taxes? 

G○○gle the term ' CASH' TEACHER OPTIONS ' and click the first site...they are that good. Go right to the OPTIONS TRADING page to see what the rich do not want you to know.

The last thing I bought from the Gap was a red raincoat.... and the colour ran when it got wet!  Not just the first time, but even after washing it repeatedly it still continued to bleed red every time it rained.

This is an ad for GAP.  Don't buy things they don't really sell.  Buy those things at other stores that GAP owns.  It's an ad for GAP.

First, Yahoo is telling us what not to buy at Old Navy....Now The Gap?  I'm guessing next week it'll be Banana Republic.  All I have to say is that you get what you pay for.  Also, watch for the Gap's sales.  I can't remember the last time that I bought anything there at full price.

Gap and Banana Republic are terrible places to buy sweaters.  They last about a week before they get balls all over them and look like you dragged them out of a dumpster.  They should receive a, "Not Green Medal" for filling the landfills with the substandard junk they sell. It makes me angry that people buy their goods in good faith and then end up having to replace them soon afterward.  This is a form of enforced consumerism.

Do not buy T-Shirts at the Gap.

They USED TO BE of better quality. Not any more. 

Jeans are still OK. And some sweaters are OK. Men's shirts as well. 
The rest is pure crap. Overpriced, cheap fabrics. Once in a while there's a dress or a jacket that's decent. 
But compared to 15 years ago, the women's section at the Gap has completely deteriorated.

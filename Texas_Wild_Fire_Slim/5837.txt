Chicago Reporter:
Jessica Moore showed up at the Daley Center, shaken and without a lawyer. She had a bad feeling about how things might play out in court.
A lawyer hired by a company that manages Chicago Housing Authority properties approached her. She followed him into courtroom 1302 and was ushered into a small conference area tucked away in the corner. A steady stream of eviction cases were called at the bench as they talked.

				Bob Barker says spay and neuter unwed parents after two.  Six is way too many even if one had a real job, so if you are already on the dole of taxpayers, you should have stopped a long time ago.  People that have their living paid by what they think is the government­, are obviously not smart enough to know that the government has no money without taking it first from those that have earned it.  Those of us that are paying for these peoples irresponsi­ble worthless behavior, are tired of paying for it.

				Wow, talk about an aggressive policy!  I don't like it that evictions can happen even before any conviction­.  An overly aggressive police officer and you're done for.  Secondly, Chicago seems to be targeting units that it really wants to demolish, thus providing incentives for eviction based on any arrest.  

I support getting rid of troublemak­ing and criminal neighbors, but these laws seem to overreach and in the process create victims of the system.  Eviction of the arrestee might even be doable (although I'm not all that comfortabl­e with it happening prior to conviction­), but the entire family having to pay the cost of one person's idiocy?  That's not right.

				I am trying to get this policy instituted in my town; it is already in a couple neighborin­g towns.  It is not about public housing, but any rental housing.  It is a "Crime Free Rental" program, which helps, and in some cases, forces landlords to evict tenants where criminal activity has occurred.  And it does not have to be the leaseholde­r, it can be anyone who lives in or even visits the home, if the crime is committed on the property.   I think it is a brilliant tool for keeping crime down.  Hopefully it will make some of these parents actually do their jobs as parents.  Some of the kids would be better off being raised by wolves.  No sympathy for this woman, or anyone like her.  Made her bed (6 times so far) and now she can lie in it.

				Seems reasonable to me. After all, most people get "thrown out" when they don't pay their rent. And in this case, they're not paying their rent and getting arrested, and expecting the free ride to continue?

				That's complete and total nonsense.  Let me remind you of something and that is, that people are innocent until proven guilty.  Should you loose you home or apartment because you've been arrested.  Considerin­g most apartment complexes today are exculding or evicting people for a felony record, this could happen to you.

				This article is eye-openin­g on so many levels and leaves me very conflicted­.  People do have to start paying their way and need to pay their rent like everyone else.  And it's not about the "low-level­ness" of the drugs, it's that fact that that low-level drug use/dealin­g will likely lead to higher-lev­el drug use/dealin­g in THAT environmen­t.  People want to complain and say that Susie Q in the 'burbs does and sells the same drugs and that may be true, but the "environme­nt" in which Susie is dealing/do­ing the drugs will most likely NOT lead to muggings, burglaries­, drive-by shootings, etc.  And that's what people who purchased their homes and wish to protect their investment are concerned about and I simply cannot blame them.  Yes, eviction is hard and it does appear that Moore is trying to do better and I hope her daughter stays on the path and escapes her environmen­t soon, but the rules are the rules and if her son doesn't care enough about his 5 siblings or his mother to stop putting their housing in jeopardy even with low-level drug activity, then Moore needs to let him go.  Black and white parents alike face this reality with irresponsi­ble children, so she is no different that any other parent in that regard and she needs to worry about how to feed, clothe and house the others.  His name would not be listed as a tenant...p­eriod!

				I think the headline is a bit misleading if you read the whole article.  Apparently her son already had an arrest and conviction and had been through rehab, so it wasn't "One and Done" before she was evicted.  She had housing support ($72 month for a 4-bedroom!­?!) and had a job, but she quit the job so that the taxpayers could support her and send her to school.  She then hooked up with a known drug dealer who was still having run-ins with the cops.  And of course none of it is her fault.  I wish there were a little more background such as what year all these children were born, because it seems to be a bit ridiculous if she went on 'welfare' or whatever they call assistance in Chicago and then she kept having more and more children.  This doesn't sound like she was a victim of circumstan­ce (she quit, didn't lose her job; she had no major health crisis; and chose to have six children), but her own bad judgment, and now, of course, everyone else is expected to clean up after her.

				This woman has six (count em) kids and no husband. Why do I know they are all on Medicare and food stamps.  This is a lack of responsibi­lity and not education ...she knows what causes kids. Rules are made and they don't have a caveat that says...exc­ept for you.  I am sorry for the children. She placed her low-life boyfriend ahead of their welfare.  This is why social engineerin­g does not work.

				I can't speak for Chicago, but the people in my area who live in public housing projcted wanted more done to route out criminal activity and make their neighborho­od safer....n­ot sure how else you can do this without looking at arrest and conviction­s....but I think conviction­s should be the deciding factor, not just an arrest. And how else should the housing authoritie­s handle it but to evict the whole family...I­F....the criminal activity took place in the home or the public housing neighborho­od.....rec­ently a family was evicted that made news in my area, another Mom with 7 kids but it was her 12 yr old daughter who was convicted on a crime, its not like the authoritie­s can evict a minor child and not the parent....­.but seems conviction­s and only those crimes that are violent committed off problem should be considered­.

				Mothers should never place a boyfriend ahead of their children. Public housing is intended for the family unit. In every town in America, boyfriends or girlfriend­s are getting a totally free ride when they move in with families receiving public benefits. They eat food and have a climate controlled roof over their heads intended for the children. Most provide nothing in return. I believe that in addition to eviction for breaking the law, any head of household found harboring a person not on the lease and in the nuclear family, should be denied public housing.

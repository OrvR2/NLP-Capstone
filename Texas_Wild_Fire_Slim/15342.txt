  College Station Middle School students were given the opportunity Wednesday to write notes to the family of a 14-year-old classmate who died after being hit by a DPS trooper while skateboarding just after 1 a.m. 
Rhonda Seaton, College Station police spokeswoman, said the accident was reported at 1:09 a.m. on the feeder road of Texas 6 near William D. Fitch Parkway. Trooper Justin Stohler was driving south on the west feeder road of Texas 6 when his patrol car struck Mark Harding, who was on his skateboard in the road, according to DPS officials.
The eighth-grader was taken to The Med with a head injury and died at the hospital, she said. The boy was attempting to cross the road with a friend, authorities said, adding that they weren’t clear what the pair were doing out at that time.
The street was closed until about 7:45 a.m. so that College Station investigators could reconstruct the accident. State crash reconstruction teams also were investigating, which is routine in crashes involving troopers.
Chuck Glenewinkel, the school district’s director of communication, said the student was involved in track, band and choir at his school. The student also participated in the youth group at Christ United Methodist Church.
Glenewinkel said an email was sent to teachers and staffers Wednesday morning informing them about the student’s death. College Station Middle School held a moment of silence Wednesday morning in remembrance of the eighth-grader. 
Additional counselors went to the campus for anyone who needed to talk. Glenewinkel said classmates of the teenager being offered time to make something to present to the student’s family.

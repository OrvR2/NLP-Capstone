Jon Stewart was right: Reporters are ignoring Ron Paul, analysis findsBy Joe PompeoMedia ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Joe Pompeo | The Cutline – Thu, Aug 18, 2011

As we reported on Tuesday, the Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul has been getting limited coverage from the news media, despite his second-place finish in last weekend's Iowa straw poll. Now there's some actual data to back that perception up.
As our colleague Chris Moody points out, an analysis by the PEW Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism shows that Paul is one of the least covered candidates in the race. (See chart below)
(PEW)
"From January 1-August 14, Paul has been a dominant newsmaker in only 27  campaign stories," according to the analysis. "That is less than one-quarter  of the media attention generated by former Massachusetts governor Mitt  Romney (120 stories), who is the top newsmaker among Republican  candidates. And he has received 25 percent as much coverage as Bachmann, the  Minnesota Congresswoman."

I don't agree with Ron Paul on everything.  I do, however, agree with him on the most important issues facing us today:  STOP WARMONGERING,GET RID OF FIAT MONEY,GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MY PERSONAL LIFE, END THE DRUG WAR, and END THE FED.  These are the most important issues facing us today.  If you can't see that, you must be watching Fox or MSNBC.

The media has been doing the same thing for decades. The media believes is should choose the president and the media is controlled by the corporations. The media believes it has the right to choose who is a viable candidate.  Thats why the political system is so rotten. The media keeps candidates out of the debates like Kucinich and Ron Paul because they don't want their message to be heard. The news media is mostly a fraud. Get your news from the internet.

Ron Paul is the ONLY candidate who makes any real sense on the big issues, and he get ignored? Yeah and its becasue THEY dont want things to get better if they did then Ron would get a fair chance, anyone who gets all fired up about any of the candidates is STUPID, I mean really stupid, it blows my mind to listen to these people saying nothing really and then to watch people look at them like there rock stars or something, get this through your heads people these idiots are going to make laws and legistlation's that impact YOUR life so use your freaking head and listen to them and dont make a decision on how they look or what the hell they do with there kids on the weekends, dont get me wrong im no high IQ genius BUT I can see a show when I see one and thats all the presidental campaign garbage is all about a big show. give Ron Paul a chance everyone else gets one, mabey if he gets a fair shot people will see that HE is the smartest one up there and thats exactly why the news media WONT give him a chance,

everyone bags on ron paul for being an isolationist. i for one think that it's a great idea to quit giving money to other countries who hate us anyways, and focus on the problems that we have AT HOME. want to fix the u.s. economic issues? close off the borders and more closely control influx of immigrants so they can become legal and part of the tax base, and QUIT GIVING AWAY MONEY THAT WE DON'T HAVE. idiot politicians

Goebbels had books from Wilson PR man Edward Bernays in his library.  And wrote how he used his tactics. I thought Wilson was a progressive Dem. but like a Dem to change the facts to fit them. So the Progressives Dems were the pre Nazi and now the liberial "progressive" Dems are the post Nazi.

Ron Paul is the ONLY candidate on either side of the aisle who consistently espouses Constitutional principles and his tenure in the House reveals that he lives and votes his Constitutional conscience!!

I am not a fan of either party - but Ron Paul is the only one who makes any sense.
That's why he doesn't get Fair media time - because he is the only one Not Bought & Paif for by special interest groups..... on either side.

The Republicans have a dilemma. Ron Paul won't do what the party's billionaire puppet masters want. Most people under 30 have no idea who Newt Gingrich is. Rick Perry scares them because of his religious beliefs. Michelle Bachman is too extreme and insane even by the current GOP standards and Mitt Romney may be just too boring.

The sad truth is Ron Paul is by now the most moderate of the Republican candidates, and therefore is the one that is the hardest for the media to sensationalize.
So I guess the media is partly (or largely) to blame as to why there are almost zero moderates of either party in Washington anymore.

Ron Paul does not cater to Special Interest groups (on the Right or Left) so Corporate owned media (both sides) either ignores him, or bashies him.
Ron Paul is the ONLY one Representing The People in 2012 !

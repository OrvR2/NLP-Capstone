9/11/11 - TEXAS STATE CEMETERY - Gov. Rick Perry commemorated the 10th anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks at a memorial ceremony at the Texas State Cemetery Twin Towers Monument. The governor has also issued a proclamation recognizing September 11th as Texas First Responders Day."Ten years later, the images of the September 11th terrorist attacks still linger in our minds, and we will never forget the lives lost," Gov. Perry said. "Our enemies failed miserably if their goal was to demoralize America and paralyze us with fear. Instead, we rose above the ashes and found unity in the face of adversity."The governor commissioned the Twin Towers Monument in 2002 on the first anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks, and it was unveiled on September 11, 2003. The memorial is dedicated to all Texans who died during the 9/11 attacks, and the military service members who lost their lives in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom.

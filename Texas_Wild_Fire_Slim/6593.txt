Moorpark, CA Patch:
Hello everyone and greetings from the Reagan Presidential Library, where the heat is on ... and with temperatures expected to get as high as 103 degrees today, I mean that literally.
The debate with the lead GOP candidates doesn't begin until 5:30 p.m. but I'll be writing throughout the day just to share what goes on here, practically in our backyard. In fact, I can see Moorpark from the room/tent I'm in.

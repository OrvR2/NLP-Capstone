To all of those critical of Anne Hathaway's "Dark Knight Rises" Catwoman costume -- and there were plenty -- you might want to watch your words. Hathaway, it appears, can kick some pretty hard butt while in that black leather bodysuit.
Following the ruckus about her non-traditional costume, Hathaway issued a semi-terse response, telling MTV, "If you didn't like the photo, you only see about a 10th of what that suit can do. And if you did like the photo, you have excellent taste."
The actress was snapped filming for the Christopher Nolan epic in Los Angeles over the weekend, where videos also caught some major destruction being simulated by the special effects team (which you can also see in the slideshow below). As the photos of Hathaway reveal, the maligned suit certainly does have some capabilities; here, we see it can aid her in beating up stunt men, throwing some nasty blocks and holding on to an apple, all at the same time.

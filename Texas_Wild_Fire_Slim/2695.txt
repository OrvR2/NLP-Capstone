Beef. In hip-hop, it’s what’s for breakfast, lunch and dinner— even if you’re a vegetarian. After all, the lyrical jabs and expletive-laden disses are what make an argument about which MC outshines another that much better. When looking at the feuds of the moment, the war of words between Lil’ Kim and Nicki Minaj is at the top of the list. While the beef escalated in 2010, looking back at 2007 promo photos of Nicki, critics and fans can argue it’s been bubbling since back then.
For those living under a rock, or not up to speed on the latest developments in this here cat fight, XXLMag.com gets down to the nitty-gritty to document the ongoing feud between these two female MCs.  —Georgette Cline

Get a life… this dispute isn’t about who looks better. Its about Nicki taking Kim’s swag and then pretending she created it while also busting shots at her. And anyway they are both rappers. Rappers should be judged lyrically and no offence to most present day rappers but Kim can kill most the dudes let alone Nicki…..

wrong this is about some wack ass washed up bitch using someone else to try and get herself back in the spotlight. i dnt even like nicki tht much i think shes mostly gimmick. bt she aint the one who started it. she kept her mouth shut for months while kim did everything she could to get back in the limelight when fact is shes washed up and wack. stealing someones swag(which i dont even think she did) maybe bad but it aint as pitiful as using someone elses fame to get your self some shine. if it wasnt for biggie no one would even know kims name.

actually all of kims songs have been written by someone else. check all her album credits. if it wasnt big it was cease and then it was one of her gonns from her beehive. and now she got a group called irs. funny how everytime she dropped something she has a group all of a sudden. lol. besides all that nicki broke records on the charts. shes touring with huge names. and sold more records with one album than kim did with all her joints together. and to top it all off the sad part of it is most of the tracks on black friday are nicki tracks. whos the bitter now?? smh. kim is cool and o grew up with her but she should just let nicki eat. she had her time and instead of putting pressure on niggas necks like she says she was busy trying to be white. case closed!

That stuff Nicki rap about. Maybe she needs Kim ghostwriters. Nicki spit stuff like 5 year olds. If I was Nicki I wouldn’t be proud of that, since she a grown ass woman.

Cease don’t even write his own shit, so how he gonna write Kims? BIG even said Kim wrote. She was the one who wanted it the most out of Junior Mafia. That’s why he pushed her the hardes. Plus BIG refused to write her rhymes because he wanted her to be respected as a femcee and not afake. The only rap he did for Kim was Queen Bitch and she didn’t get any profit from that.

Who the fuck are you to say she’s done??
Like seriously who the fuck are you??
As long as she’s making music and packing out clubs & venues she can do what the fuck she wants. Obviously someone’s checking for her because people are still paying to see her.

Here we go again….
What shit exactly has Kim said?? Because I along with a whole lot of people have heard every interview since she first spoke on it last spring and all she’s done is explain the of the story Nicki always leaves out.
Notice how Nicki never ever, no one time spoke about what went down with “Grinding Making Money” or why she never acknowledges why she started dissing Kim in the 1st place.

Umm Nicki started this beef. When she came up, she was taking many subliminal shots at Kim. Moreover she swagger jacked her…. and If you dont see it, then you must be blind…. Shes coppied the wigs and the whole Barbie movement. Lil’ Kim’s black Friday kills Romans revenge and Tragedy put together.
KIM IS THE QUEEN AND NICKI IS A PRINCESS FOR NOW>>>
and can people stop saying Kim is old… Nicki isn’t 26 (she lied about her age, shes 29 according to yahoo) and Kim is only 34…

y’all skipped the Ray J & Drake involvement…and I’m not surprised either…
but if anyone skips over the first TWO photos, which was what EVERYONE was saying, Minaj was stealing Kim’s SWAG, NOT RAP STYLE, then we know you’re a jaded fan talking trash. There’s PROOF right in front of you. 
All the old/ugly/plastic surgery slander BS doesn’t overcome the FACTS presented.

THANK YOU!!!!
Isn’t it funny how Nicki and her stupid ass fans don’t ever say shit about Ray J & Drake seeing as their the one’s who sparked this. 
Nicki got noticed and got a big head and Drake just help gas the situation by jumping in it. Kim was on tour last spring/summer and didn’t say a word about Nicki till the “Hello Good Morning” diss.

Lil Kim is a fuckin LOSER. damn, ma you had you’re time to shine. let the next bitch get her shine on..
You don’t see Trina, Foxy Brown, Eve, Missy Elliott, Remy, Da Brat, Lauryn Hill hating on Nicki over biting their styles… all of these other women have applauded Nicki for making it & being a voice for the women.
Hip-Hop is RECYCLE, all artists have taken/borrowed from those who came before them, including Lil Kim .. she practically jacked BIG’s whole rhymebook for her albums..
With that being said. Kim, how are you attacking Nicki minaj, but you haven’t responded to Foxy brown’s “bang bang” record, you attack those who are weaker than you, but not those who are lyrically better than you ?
OH, is that what “hip-hop beef” is about ? DAMN IDIOT!

Nicki did not only jack Kim’s style and flow, but dissed her in the process! Kim just simply stated you need to pay homage! You don’t see Jay-Z dissing Biggie after he swipes all his catch phrases and lines! No he gives him his propts and pays respect because without him there would be no you. And Nicki never did that. Just stole her whole style from the fake tits to the barbie look and said fuck you?? Where is that acceptable??

Kim already said hella s*** about fox waaaaay back. And she said she almost got killed on “Black Friday.” Foxy can’t even stay on beat anymore, plus her hearing aids are always falling out. KIM just signed with Universal & Nikki got smacked upside the head with a suitcase.

nicki minaj is a SWAGGER JACKING CLOWN and anyone that likes her is a clown. Biggie found Kim, a real nigga with talent. Lil Wayne is just like nicki, switching styles left and right because he is a loser and will never be a REAL LYRICIST like biggie or lil Kim. PERIOD. If you like good music, listen to real hip hop, not these fake ass thugs lil Wayne and haha drake! What a joke! Might I suggest a real female MC for you? LAURYN HILL.

You f*cking c*nt. BIG would sign Nicki as his personal fuck toy. He would of also signed her to be Kim’s slave, feeding her grapes and fanning her with the feather. Hell, Kim could even strap on a fake dick and stick her where she shits

Lil kim is DONE. She was done once she went to jail. She got released in 06 and has yet to release an album or 1 quality song. She’s now mad that the new chick is doing big and is the center of attention like she WAS back in 97-03. It would be diffrent if kim was relevent on her own today and not living only off of the past. Nicki has a point. Before this so called beef when was the last time ANYBODY was checking for kim ?

@Fireforreal It really doesn’t matter if Kim is done or not. Anyone can go get some old albums and magazine and steal someone’s style and become a star these days??  That’s ridiculous! What if I just jacked Lauren Hill’s whole style and flow?? Yes she is done but if I took her style and started talking trash on her do you think people wouldn’t get mad?? Do you think she wouldn’t come back to challenge me?? Come on!! Who do you think you are fucking magazine swag ass bitch?? lol

The timeline in ONE line: Kim is an egomaniac. She wanted Nicki to lick her shitty thong to somewhat rectify the fact that she’s washed up even though Nicki gladly paid homage through her music and acknowledging her publicly in interviews, which is all that actually really matters. Nope. Not enough for Kim. Nonsense ensues, mostly on the part of Kim. To be continued. End of article. Simple as that.

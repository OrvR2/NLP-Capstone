now from rain to exactly the opposite. a part of the country where it's been so hot and dry, the problem now is raging and drought-fed wildfires. nbc's janet shanlian is live tonight in 
oklahoma city
. janet, good evening.


>> reporter: 
brian, good evening. they're having a tough time getting a handle on these fires, they're 
leap frogging
 through communities. and with this persistent drought, something as small as a cigarette butt can set an entire neighborhood up in flames. for wind whipped wildfires.


>>
we had a lot of people and three dogs.


>> reporter: 
they had an hour's warning. as lincecum surveys what might be salvageable, it's clear there's nothing.


>>

world war
 i hero and i had his pictures and his medals and all that.


>> reporter:

>>
this helicopter is responding to one of the many flare-ups, there are

>>

>>

>> reporter:

command center
 is going to stay up and staffed all night long in hopes of preventing any further loss.

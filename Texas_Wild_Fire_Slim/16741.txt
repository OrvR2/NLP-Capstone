Grande now carrying Longhorn Network; Time Warner, others aren't

Grande Communications has agreed to show the Longhorn Network, though other major carriers have yet to make distribution deals for the new University of Texas showcase.
Area Grande subscribers could watch the Texas Longhorns beat the Rice Owls 34-9 on Saturday evening, and 24-hour coverage of Longhorn sports is available on Grande Channel 25 and Grande HD Channel 825.
Negotiations between ESPN and San Marcos-based Grande Communications reportedly continued in the days leading up to the launch of the network Aug. 26. Grande made its announcement Friday.
ESPN has a $300 million agreement with the University of Texas to operate a year-round, 24-hour network for 20 years. It will include coverage of 200 varsity events each year, studio shows, and academic and cultural happenings.
“As a Texas-based company, Grande understands the passion our customers have for Texas sports,” Grande president Matt Murphy said.
Besides Waco, Grande serves the Austin, San Marcos, San Antonio, Midland-Odessa, Corpus Christi and Dallas markets. Its primary competitor locally is Time Warner Cable, which does not yet offer the network.
“This is absolutely going to be an enticement to anybody who is a Longhorn fan,” said Matt Rohre, vice president of Grande Communications and general manager of Waco-area operations.
Rohre said the network is available to those who subscribe to Grande’s Preferred service, or combinations that include that tier. He said Preferred is available for $49.99 a month and includes more than 150 channels.
Adding the Longhorn Network will not create a price increase, Grande said. The LHN became a sore spot with Texas A&M University, which felt it could create a recruiting advantage for its rivals from Austin.
The Aggies will leave the Big 12 Conference and want to join the Southeastern Conference.
Other shock waves hit the Big 12 during the weekend, with speculation that Oklahoma, Texas, Oklahoma State and Texas Tech could bolt from the league to join the Pac-12, creating a Pac-16 superconference.
Meanwhile, the new network has become a source of controversy in another arena. Larger cable and wireless companies have been slow to strike deals to add the network to their lineups.
So far, those carrying it include six smaller companies in the Houston area; Verizon FiOS, which in Texas is available almost exclusively in the Dallas-Fort Worth area; and Grande Communications.
Verizon has about 4 million FiOS customers nationwide, and those living outside Texas can get the Longhorn Network only if they subscribe to the most expensive tier called Ultimate, spokesman Kevin Laverty said.
Time Warner Cable, the biggest carrier in Texas, has no deal to carry the network, nor do heavyweights such as Comcast, Dish Network or DirecTV, according to sources with the LHN.
“It is definitely unfortunate for Texas fans, but we’re in a 20-year deal, so the fact that we’re a week in and are dealing with this really isn’t that unusual,” network vice president Stephanie Druley said.
ESPN released a statement saying it is pursuing other companies.
“Conversations are ongoing,” it said. “We are talking to all carriers to secure as wide a distribution as possible.”
Time Warner Cable released a statement of its own: “We have had discussions with ESPN about the Longhorn Network, and at this time we do not have an agreement in place.”
Spokeswoman Melissa Sorola said Time Warner would have no further comment.

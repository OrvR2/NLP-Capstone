Businesses post most job openings in 3 yearsBy CHRISTOPHER S. RUGABER - AP Economics Writer | AP – 14 hrs ago

WASHINGTON (AP) — Companies in July advertised the most jobs in three years, and layoffs declined — a bit of hope for a weak economy. Still, many employers are in no rush to fill openings.The Labor Department said Wednesday that employers increased their postings to 3.23 million from 3.17 million in June. That is the largest number of openings since August 2008. Typically, it takes anywhere from one to three months to fill an opening.More openings don't guarantee more jobs. The government said last week that employers failed to add any net jobs in August, the worst month for hiring since September 2010. The unemployment rate stayed for the second straight month at 9.1 percent.The worsening jobs outlook has put pressure on President Barack Obama. He is expected on Thursday to introduce a $300 billion jobs package before a joint session of Congress. The plan will likely include extensions of the payroll tax cut and long-term unemployment benefits, tax incentives for businesses that hire and money for public works projects.There's heavy competition for each job. Nearly 14 million people were out of work in July. So roughly 4.3 unemployed workers were competing for each opening. That's a slight improvement from June, when the ratio was 4.45. In a healthy economy, the ratio is closed to 2 to 1.Total openings are about 1.1 million higher than they were in July 2009, one month after the recession officially ended. But they are still far below the 4.4 million openings that existed in December 2007, when the recession began.The biggest gains in openings were reported in manufacturing, trade, transportation and utilities.The report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, or JOLTs, illustrates the high degree of churn that takes place in the job market each month. Total hiring in July slowed, to 3.98 million from 4.06 million.Total layoffs and quits also dropped to 3.92 million from 3.99 million. The difference between total hires and total quits and layoffs is similar to the net jobs gain of 85,000 reported for July.The economy isn't growing enough to spur much hiring. It expanded at an annual pace of only 0.7 percent in the first six months of this year, the slowest growth since the recession ended. Growth may improve to a 2 percent rate in the second half, economists forecast, but that's still too weak to encourage much hiring.

the Bush administration inherited a strong economy from the Clinton administration. There were robust budget surpluses for as far as the eye could see. But during the eight years of the Bush administration, those surpluses became deficits. The national debt doubled – going from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. Moreover, the country went into a horrible economic recession in the final months of the Bush administration, teetering on the brink of a depression. Yet Cheney refused to accept any personal responsibility. 

The huge budget deficits were largely the result of no significant spending cuts to pay for two wars, two rounds of tax cuts and a new, unfunded Medicare mandate – prescription drug benefits for seniors.

Funny how the media totally ignores the fact that 45000 new full time jobs were created last month and that 430,000 new part time jobs were created as well.  Bad news for the GOP, jobs are still happening.

Unemployment was 4.2 at the beginning of Bush's terms, and 7.2 at the end of his second term. That's a 3 percent increase. (What happened to all the jobs that the tax cut for business and wealthy were supposed to create.) It was 7.2 at the beginning of Obama's 
election and is 9.1 now, that's an increase of 1.3.  So let's blame Obama for all the unemployed, it seems that the Bush administration is responsible for a raise in unemployment more than Obama.  Along with the housing crash, Wall st crash and banks failing.  Just like the Savings and Loans crash under Papa Bush.

This is still a Bush economy and the reason for the long recovery is that (Bush) did a phenomenal job of screwing up everything under the sun.

Wow, look at all of the radicalized Republican propaganda clown circus clowns refusing to accept factual evidence. Typical of their kind. They hate facts. They hate the truth. They hate journalism and journalists who reveal the facts and the truth.

Q: How many of the unemployed are truly qualified for the unfilled high tech jobs available ?  For the slow (most of you) that is obviously a rhetorical question.  
A: Not many...!!!

This is great news! At this rate, it will take only 474 years for the unemployment rate to go back down to the level that Barrack Obama inherited. 
Hope and change rocks!

This country continually moves farther to the right (less taxes, less social programs, more deregulation for corporations, harsher laws on immigration, union busting, etc.) and things continually get worse. Yet the answer from so many people is to continue the swing even further right. Where is the logic in any of this? I'd really like an answer.

If you were a small business owner and you constantly hear a President talk about increased regulation, spreading the wealth, and increasing taxes, would YOU be looking to expand your business and create jobs???

Everyone from the President to Congress, from 2002-2011 are responsible for the recession and the lack of recovery. Failed policies got us here, and failed policies are keeping us here.

You see? the jobs are out there more than 3 million openings (thats available jobs that need to be filled). So why arent Companies filling these jobs? Dont tell me its because of taxes and uncertainty, because if that were the reason the jobs wouldnt be available. No, the jobs arent being filled and these companies are sitting on trillions in cash because its a giant conspiracy to defeat Obama in 2012. Obamas job plan will be trashed by the Republicans. Everything will be blocked by the tea party in the house and it will be the same old non cooperation by the Republicans as before. If this continues then Standard and Poors will down grade the credit rating again, and again the Republicans will get blamed. Now Mitt Romney has come out with his own plan for creating jobs, which is the same old Republican chin music as before. Cut taxes for the rich (which we know doesnt create jobs) . We saw that when the Republicans promised job creation if they passed the Bush tax cuts extension. Not one job was created. all that was created was that multitrillion dollar was chest Corporations are sitting on. Then he throws in a token tax cut for the middle class which amounts to nothing realy just a few wont have to pay capital gains tax. Its all a sham and the American people will see right through it. Romney even said he wants to repeal health care reform. The same legislation he signed into law in Mass. Its all just chin music. Knock the Republicans out of office in 2012 and the economy will recover just fine.

Actually, the vast majority of those jobs are for skilled and/or technical people.  As anyone knows who has a math, physics or engineering degree, there is no shortage of openings.  Here in the northeast, the average electrical engineering grad has 4 job offers awaiting him or her and the salaries start in the higher 5 figures and rapidly increase.  So the message here is: your old job that required a strong back and a dim mind is gone.  Get your butt in school, learn something about math and physics and join us in the new economy.

Oh, and for you right-wing extremists and Republican Party apologists, try turning off Fox News, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.  Listening to their pollution ain't gettin' you where you want to be.  Get off the couch, head down to the your nearest college, get your butt in gear and learn some math and physics and engineering!  You'll never be a whining, negative Republican again once you do!  Enjoy!

Jobs? In my life, when offered a job, I accepted. I've never had a professional career, or occupation per se, just jobs. Now have 19 years with the same company. Started in an entry level job and worked my way up through a series of better paying jobs within the company. My point is, in times like these, don't you take any job or 2 or 3 you can get? I don't mean to over simplify anyone's situation. I understand there are child care considerations and stanards of living that people are stuck in, but where there's a will there's a way. And it's our will and determination that drives us to over come. Don't give up America, keep grinding and tell the government if they leave us alone, get out of our way, we can change things on our own!!!

Hey libs --- instead of always saying "tax cut for the rich" why don't you show me one --- show me where the rich pay no to low taxes --- that is BS--- it is nearly one half of working Americans that are considered low income or exempt in some other way that pay no taxes --- the rich actually pay the loafers tax bill for them -- you people need to get your head out of your aces and look at reality instead of spewing BS!

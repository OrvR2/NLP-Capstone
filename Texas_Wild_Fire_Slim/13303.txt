Most Talked About Stories




We got rid of cable tv a while ago, and it's been a blessing, really. We don't waste time flipping aimlessly through channels, or 'settling' on watching something we're not really interested in, just to wait for a show we do want to watch. Our toddler doesn't even pay attention to tv's at other people's houses when they're on. She likes to read and play and learn. She has a very long attention span, and a great memory compared to other kids her age that we have seen, and even some older kids. We won't be getting cable tv again.Ryan, GuelphDoes Spongebob ruin kids' concentration?

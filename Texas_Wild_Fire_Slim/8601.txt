   Ellex Medical Lasers Limited consolidates laser and ultrasound manufacturingPRWeb – 1 hr 51 mins ago





   Ellex Medical Lasers Limited (ASX:ELX), a global leader in ophthalmic and optometric technology, announced plans to consolidate the manufacture of all Ellex laser and ultrasound products out of its state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Adelaide, Australia.Adelaide, South Australia (PRWEB) September 08, 2011  Ellex Medical Lasers Limited http://www.ellex.com/ Ellex Medical Lasers  (ASX:ELX), a global leader in ophthalmic and optometric technology, today announced plans to consolidate the manufacture of all Ellex laser and ultrasound products out of its state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Adelaide, Australia.
Over the coming months, Ellex will transfer the Sacramento-based manufacturing activities for the Eye Cubed™ diagnostic ultrasound system to its Adelaide-based manufacturing facility, which is currently responsible for the manufacture of the Company’s laser products. Following the successful transfer of these manufacturing activities the Sacramento facility will be closed.
The initiative is expected to deliver considerable cost reductions and production efficiencies, and will ensure optimal utilisation of the Company’s Adelaide-based manufacturing infrastructure and resources.
“We are confident that our Adelaide facility and the technical expertise of this team are developed to the extent that we can integrate our laser and ultrasound production processes,” commented Ellex CEO, Tom Spurling. “Not only will this allow us to leverage the extensive manufacturing expertise we have developed in Adelaide, it will also deliver a significant reduction in manufacturing costs.”
“In order to facilitate a smooth transition, key personnel from the Sacramento facility will be retained in order to manage the transfer of skills to our Adelaide team over the coming months, with work already underway in this area.”
The Eye Cubed http://www.ellex.com/corp/products/diagnostic-ultrasound/eye-cubed Eye Cubed ultrasound ™ is one of the Company’s best-selling products, with thousands of systems installed worldwide. Since acquiring Sacramento-based ophthalmic ultrasound pioneers Innovative Imaging Inc. in 2006, Ellex has expanded the Eye Cubed’s market reach to include Europe and Asia, contributing to increased market share worldwide.
“This is an obvious next step for our ultrasound business. In 2007 we established the Adelaide-based engineering and development team for the Eye Cubed, and the opportunity to now closely align the activities of this team with the manufacture of the Eye Cubed will ensure improved efficiency across both engineering and production moving forwards,” said Mr. Spurling.
Ellex expects to commence Adelaide-based production of the Eye Cubed™ B scan http://www.ellex.com/corp/products/diagnostic-ultrasound/eye-cubed B scan  from October onwards, with customer service support continuing to be managed by the Company’s regional sales subsidiaries.

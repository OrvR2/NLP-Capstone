SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California's highest court seems inclined to side with backers of the state's same-sex marriage ban in thinking that the state Constitution gives ballot initiative proponents legal authority to defend their measures in court.
The California Supreme Court heard more than an hour of arguments Tuesday on that question, which could prove pivotal to the future of the voter-approved ban, known as Proposition 8.
Several justices noted that the court has never refused to allow the sponsors of ballot questions to appear before it when measures were challenged.
The Supreme Court is considering the matter at the request of a federal appeals court that is weighing whether the ban violates the constitutional rights of same-sex couples.

				Let them have their standing..­.I'd love to see this case (and all the faulty logic of the proponents of Prop. 8) be put before the U.S. Supreme Court. I understand that no new evidence can be introduced and Judge Vaughn Walker made a well-writt­en ruling. So, let's go through those facts at the national level and see what happens.

				The CA Constituti­on says that the Governor and AG have standing to defend the laws of the state, not every citizen.  The Governor and AG also have discretion to decide which suits they will defend, and may choose not to defend a suit.

While that may seem undesirabl­e, that really is what the CA Constituti­on says.

If the citizens want to change it, they have the power to amend that Constituti­on.

So, under the actual current law, the proponents really do not have standing.  If they had wanted to, they could have amended the CA Constituti­on to give themselves standing.  If they want to in the future, they still can amend, but that would be for future cases.  

Personally­, I would like to see this case get a decision on the merits in the Federal appeals court, and even in the Supreme court.  I don't live in CA.  The only way MY state is ever going to repeal its Constituti­onal DOMA provision, is if the Federal Courts make the decision.

				That's not in the Constituti­on, that's in law. If you cannot prove that you've been harmed or will be harmed by an action, then you cannot sue.

For example, if the people in the town I live in voted to rezone my property as commercial­, I could sue because I could show harm. If, after suing, I won, and the town attorneys chose not to appeal, my neighbors would have to show that NOT rezoning my property harms them before THEY could appeal the decision.

SAME thing in California­. The AG and Governor chose not to appeal the decision, and these people are trying to appeal the decision. If they cannot prove that they are harmed or will be harmed by the ruling then they cannot carry on the appeal.

				The proponents of Prop 8 were allowed to intervene at the trial level and now are fighting to keep the video/audi­o record of the trial from the public.  What if the 9th Circuit told them, you can defend the initiative on appeal, but the video/audi­o will have to be public if you do. 

If they had to, I wonder which the proponents would choose: a fully public trial record or the right to appeal the trial judgment?

				I hate prop 8, but I think its outrageous that the courts could rule that the conservati­ve groups dont have standing. The SCOTUS conservati­ves (scalia et al) have denied access to the courts of many seeking justice by arguing that parties seeking to sue dont have "standing"­, i.e., that they are unaffected by whatever it is they are suing about. 

The conservati­ves on the court have used this dishonest tactic to deny court access to citizens and activists seeking justice. In general, strict requiremen­ts for standing favor the rich and powerful in society. So its ironic that such rules for standing are now biting conservati­ve activists. 

Everyone should have access to the courts, including the conservati­ves in this case.

				"Everyone should have access to the courts, including the conservati­­ves in this case."

Why should everyone have access regardless of standing?  If you cannot demonstrat­e harm, why should you get to sue?  Should I be able to sue you for some comment you made online that I didn't like if it doesn't cause me any demonstrab­le harm?

They did have access to the courts.  They were allowed to defend the propositio­n in federal court.  The problem now is that they didn't like the outcome and wish to appeal, an entirely different issue from the defense of the propositio­n.

				In the Internal Revenue Code, for each section of the federal taxation code, there is at least one paragraph that it titled "Definitio­ns." Many times, the definition of a word for tax purposes does not correspond with the common sense definition­. Our 235 years of legislatur­es changed the meaning of thousands of English words for legal purposes for as long as a Congress existed. Please don't come to me and say that the word "marriage" is defined as only between a man and a woman, because our legislativ­e body has already changed that meaning several times... from "so long as ye both shall live" to "until divorced," from "of same faith and belief" to "separatio­n of state and religion" and from "between people of same race" to "every citizen is equal when faced with the law." In no way I will ever believe a marriage, for tax purposes--­and thus for legal purposes--­is between a man a woman. Changes to definition­s were made for the sake of fairness. In today's context, we mean public fairness when we talk about recognitio­n of same-sex marriage.

				And now we have Republican Presidenti­al Candidates signing pledged to non elected people that they would support an amendment to the Constituti­on banning same sex marriage. The question is what would those states that have accepted same sex marriage do? I say California though going through this inane court battle would not take away the rights of our citizens.

				I find it bizarre that there already is a marriage amendment lounging around Congress, where it's been languishin­g since 2003. They couldn't get it out of Washington then and out to the states--an­d that was before Massachuse­tts. And given the highly partisan political climate in Washington and in the states, I'm not sure we could get an amendment passed that agreed the sun rises in the East daily. Amendments are long and arduous to pass, and the candidates surely know their chances with this would be uphill at best. It's all grandstand­ing. If they're really that committed, why doesn't Bachman resurrect HJRes 56?

				There is another motion too that is up for grabs...th­e high court might toss it back down or just uphold the lower court..but what is more interestin­g
Is the supports of Prop 8 do not want the video tape released. They have let out copies of the transcript­s but they trying to block the people who brought suit against and won the case from releasing the video and audio of the proceeding­s...The Tpublicans do NOT want the video out there or the audio either.. It would undo them to have their reasons out there..in their own words
Tpublicans have said, that they are worried about threats and possible harm to be done to the witnesses or any one connected to the case..and that is there reasoning.­.like the Tpeople are such gentle folks right?

				I've heard they're terrified that the tapes would find their way into political ads in their next targeted states, and they're afraid it would do a lot of damage. Of course it would! We've read the transcript­s. To hear those words spoken or to see the Rev. Tam stammering away on the stand, spewing ignorance and bigotry would be a pretty damning political ad.

				They are afraid of the same thing right here in California­, where they are trying to qualify an initiative to repeal a recent law, the Fair, Accurate, Inclusive and Respectful (FAIR) Education Act, which lets students be told that such people as Alexander the Great, Hadrian, Leonardo da Vinci, Lord Byron, Walt Whitman, Willa Cather, Jane Addams, Rock Hudson, Cole Porter, Leonard Bernstein, et al., were gay, lesbian or bisexual. Is that so terrible? Apparently so. 

Sound bites of Tam's and Blankenhor­n's trial testimony will not help their cause.

				Prop 8 supporters­, time is not your friend. 
All the demographi­cs and studies show that samesex marriage will be the law of the land eventually­.
We just have to wait for all the elders and less American youngsters to pass on and dilute.

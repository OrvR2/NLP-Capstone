U.S. authority is at war with the American people under the pretense of “war on terrorism.” This strategy is an age old Machiavellian system of building up external fear and using the emergency as an excuse for all kinds of domestic suppression. What to expect: • More censorship. • Jailed dissidents. • Expropriated property. • Nationalization of bankrupt companies. • Expropriation of savings and retirement funds with currency debasement (the massive creation of “money”). How will the American people respond? • People will finally dump the currency for gold/silver and barter. • “Tax evasion” will escalate. • Silent and open civil disobedience. • Vast increase of political dissidence. • Mistrust in government will spark bank runs as government freezes all bank accounts. • Open hostility in the streets.Related PostsOff-duty Policeman Hit By Suspects’ Car (0)Vitamin D, Calcium Supplements Taken During Adolescence Can Help Curb Osteoporosis Rates (3)Acids Good And Bad (47) Filed Under: Personal Liberty Articles, Privacy Bob Livingston is an ultra-conservative American who has been writing a newsletter for 42 years.

Paul Trood says: November 18, 2008 at 8:04 pmBob do you really think the U.S. sinking into anarchy is a possibility?  A very scary scenario. Reply Bob Livingston says: November 19, 2008 at 11:06 pmYes, it is probable that the US will eventually fall into anarchy. Here is the reason: What we are into now will destroy the middle class leaving a huge segment of the population in poverty. Poverty is cannon fodder for revolution. Poor people have nothing to lose but their chains so they will take to the streets.Every alert American should read about the 2002 financial crisis and breakdown of Argentina. The people who didn’t recognize the signals waited too late to get their US dollars out of the banks. They were confiscated by the government under the ruse of forcing the private money into government bonds which also became worthless. I do wish that I could be optimistic but I have to be realistic.

Reply blatxrox says: May 4, 2009 at 10:36 pmI think that our own military will disobey orders from Obama when it comes down to making our great nation that we have shed blood for, fail.Obama is being watched closely by everyone in America. This nation won’t fall without bloodshed.Someone will come out of the woodwork & try to assasinate him before he takes us down the socialist/ fascist path.This nation & the military hold the oath of the Constitution close to their hearts.I think they will find out something about Obama , such as a scandal, that forces him to resign or be impeached. There is something very sinister about this man. What do you think, Bob???? Reply Robert says: October 19, 2009 at 7:28 amI hope that no such attempt is made on Obama. I do not agree with his policies and the way he is leading our country. But should such an attempt be made, this would work right into the hands of the democrats. They would then push for gun control and more invasives policies into our private lives. And God forbid such an attempt were successful. We’d end up with Biden. And if he got taken out, we’d be stuck with Nancy Pelosi. Then we’d see the greatest illegal immigration of US citizens into Mexico. And I believe that Rahm Emmanuel would be the one who put out the hit. He never saw a crisis that he couldn’t work to his advantage. Reply Sandy says: February 6, 2010 at 12:29 pmIt may be possible that someone could get close enough to Obama to make an attempt on his life…. but my sense is that the country will go down (as T. S. Eliot suggests in “The Hollow Men”) “not with a bang, but a whimper.” Reply Prophet says: May 20, 2009 at 7:48 amI have been convinced for some time that anarchy is a distinct possibility if, after two years, we are unable to reverse the majority in congress. Things are headed into such a condition that the poor will be unable to survive without violence. Few will see their children hungry without making every type effort at their disposal to feed them.When fuel prices become prohibitive that people can neither heat their homes or drive their cars, violence is inevitable. Reply Lin Bradley says: August 7, 2009 at 9:21 pmDear Friends, When I heard the guy in the (WH?) tell us to shut up, sit down and “get out of the way”, I knew it had started.  When a so-called Prez tells the country to get out of the way and let him do whatever he wants to do, not talk or say what they think, it is time to get that man out of there how ever and whatever! I only hope and pray that the lawsuits going on in Santa Ana, CA will be successful in forcing BO to turn over his BC and ALL papers for the country to see just who he is, but I somehow doubt it. He is red and there isn’t much one can do but over whelm his regime and throw him out. That will take some doing as he does has some clout on his side with Chicago and unions thugs doing his bidding at town hall meetings, etc. They just beat up a black man holding a “don’t tread on me” sign. Very sad but reality strikes hard. We were warned by Michael Savage and others but did not listen. I  knew this was coming. Months ago I knew we had a commie in the White (Red) House. It is all coming true before our eyes. Those who voted for him knowingly or unknowingly are getting a snoot full and are now yelling loudly…. FOUL! Many Christians who sat home and let him win are really to blame for this. McCain would not have done this to us. He was not the man we needed but he isn’t a commie either. So here we are. Months later with a dictator and a Congress full of red-heads. God help us! Reply Terry Satler says: September 7, 2009 at 7:10 pmThe conservatives are now outnumbered by the radical left. Race is an issue and it it reverse racism now when townhall meetings bring together concerned and panicked taxpayers who are then coined as racists and Anti-American. Where is the rage America? They are taking all our freedoms away from us brick by brick and so very quickly. We are now being ruled by Chicago-mob style politics. We the people..we got sold out by these greedy elitist! We need a party for the people..We need true representation by authentic people who care about us..Somebody that is strong, sincere and loves America! Is it too late for us Americans? Now that these radicals have all the control and ACORN is “counting the votes” there seems to be little chance for a real change to improve this horrible situation. Maybe all those prophesies about 2012 hold some truth. Reply Lalitashaki says: January 15, 2010 at 10:22 amObama is not a US citizen as he claims he was not born in Hawaii, as he claims and he went to college under an alias, he was trained by terrorists, this is all in a report sent to me to inform us that our so called president is only trying to start an anarchy, they are all not trying to help anyone but theirselves, we need a better government and their the ones that should be checked out completely, why are we going for a president that was born in Kenya???????? Never was a US citizen. Reply Lalitashaki says: January 15, 2010 at 10:32 amMy husband and I are retired seniors, yesterday I had a knock on my gate, when I went out there, there was 9 or 10 police in black swat outfits, telling me they had a complaint that their was people living in tents and trailers on my propery as well as my neighbors property, well yes their are people living in tents and trailers on MY NEIGHBORS PROPERTY not on mine but because they weren’t home, they came to my house and wanted to do an inspection to make sure we did not have them on out place, Well their is no room for a tent or trailer here, so my husband and I went out to let them come in and look,they did not want to take out word. ( we did not have to but they had Large Rifles and guns out and we felt we should to avoid any further problems, and we let them in but this is a load of crap because someone says anything they want to cause problems, that they would actually act on it, why are they bothering tax paying seniors, when their are lots of other problems for them to attend to, what is this, just start bothering anyone over false acusations, what is this government coming to.   What are they doing with all that money they claim to go to the moon with, and they have never gone to the moon, watch capricorn one and see for yourself, they can’t possibly go to the moon it is farther away than the sun, do some research they are always lieing to the public to missapropriate funds. stealing and lieing are their thing and they are just getting worse. Reply Lewis Munn says: April 20, 2011 at 11:53 pmI think you need to check a basic astronomy book!  It will tell you the moon is not even a quarter million miles away, while the sun is many many millions of miles away.Further the moon is much smaller than the earth, and the sun is many many times larger.Finally, the moon is hard and can be landed upon, while the sun is a gas, and if you tried to do so you would just sink in and be vaporized too. Reply Michael J. says: May 7, 2011 at 7:25 amLewis Munn said: “while the sun is a gas, and if you tried to do so you would just sink in and be vaporized too.”Not if you went at night. Reply sabre' says: February 26, 2010 at 4:35 pmI am very afraid of Obama. I am afraid  of his cronies in ACORN. I can’t believe the stupidity of the people who voted him in. I want all ILLEGAL ALIENS DEPORTED. Their anchor babies too! I want ENGILSH spoken when I go in to a business. ANY languages other than ENGLISH should only be spoken in their homes. ALL LEGAL IMMIGRANTS should become assimilated. Learn our culture and learn our ways. Their traditions should NOT be forced on me, after all I DID NOT MOVE TO THEIR COUNTRY…THEY CAME TO MINE. They should keep their traditions in their homes! Reply sabre' says: February 26, 2010 at 4:36 pmCAN ANYONE IN OUR GOVERNMENT DO THE ABOVE MENTIONED?????? I am NOT the only AMERICAN who feels this way! Reply Lewis Munn says: April 21, 2011 at 12:12 amMany could, if they wanted to.But they are happy with their various bribes, and philosophies bent on ruin of the nation, so they choose or are paid to let it all go!It is hard to do your job when the President is letting illegals take the whole country, deliberately, and fights against our lawmen who try to enforce our laws.  Fighting against an evil government who breaks our nation’s laws is very hard, since they can put a whole army up against you to force you to obey or die.  They can revoke your citizenship and your rights, and torture you to death slowly, and nobody can touch them or save you, not even the UN! Reply Frank Zappa says: April 20, 2010 at 1:37 pmWell Folks it’s like this;We have turned our back on God as a nation, we have thrown God out of our Schools, Ripped the 10 Suggestions, OH sorry The Ten Commandments out of our courts, schooling system, (What a Joke) so now we have a generation of KNOW NOTHINGS (Like The Obama’s for instance) of the world Oh abortions who could forget.God has made a declaration that for each aborted baby, he promised that he would send an Illegal to take the place of the children killed in this country so according to my calculations that would be just about 50 Million give or take a few. YOU CANNOT SEPARATE GOD FROM GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE WERE FOUNDED UPON AS A NATION, WE GET OUR “RIGHT’S” SO CALLED FROM GOD NOT GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE IF WE GET THEM FROM GOVERNMENT THEN GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE THEM AWAY. What people also fail to take into account is that in order for people to graduate from ANY UNIVERSITY was 4 years of bible, check it out for yourself. There is only one way out of this mess, and it is NOT electing more conservatives. HERE IS THE DEAL ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF GOD. “IF REMEMBER IF MY PEOPLE CALLED BY MY NAME WILL TURN FROM THEIR SINS AND REPENT FROM THEIR EVIL WAYS, THEN……THEN WILL I HEAR FROM HEAVEN AND HEAL THEIR LAND. From what I know at this point, and what I have seen we  are RACING TOWARDS JUDGMENT. If people were to study our very own nations capital there are engravings of Moses (The Law Giver) and many more biblical characters engraved in stone at our very capital in Washington, so please spare me the “Separation of Church and state comment,” it ain’t working. There are many more topic’s such as the So Called “Music of our day.” lyrics like Kill’em rape’em Stab’em Beat’em, and Mother F*** em well I am sure you get it by now. Think of how far we have gone as a nation. Summary: We as a nation backed Israel for decades, we no longer do that, our “Music” From Country/Folk Songs to Gang Banging Rap, A nation that exported Charity and Bible scholars to the needy, now we export porn. YES Folks We Have Come a long way baby. You Now Have The Government YOU DESERVE. OBAMA….Oh yes Obama was born in Kenya, went to Indonesia, for which his real Name is “Barry Satoro,” so you may ask yourself what make me informed….Hummm I have a wife who saw the birth certificate of Barak Obama and so I asked her to translate it for me….So that’s it. God help us all…You will need it before it’s all over. Reply s c says: May 31, 2010 at 2:26 pmFZ, it’s too bad that the real Frank Zappa isn’t around to compare his notes on Ronald Reagan with notes on Obummer. For what it’s worth, Zappa put Tipper Gore in her place when Washington dared to get involved in music censorship. While Zappa was no doubt very liberal in creating his music, I think he would be amazed and sickened that America could produce someone who could be even “spookier” than Reagan. It would be refreshing to hear Zappa admit that when compared to Obummer, Reagan wasn’t so bad after all. Reply goldauraone says: August 27, 2010 at 5:28 pmLook again at 9/11 and Bush family…did you all miss something? pilotsfor911truth.org explains a lot. Reply Baba says: July 11, 2011 at 8:33 am“To Destroy a Society you have to destroy their money.” Read Milton Friedman’s books. “Money Mischief” is great! I’m not promoting Friedman’s books; just a citizen who wants to learn more about the money system, and why the United States and other countries are stuck between a stone and a hard place with their currency. It is all coming to a head and we American Citizens are experiencing the worst presidency in history. Homeland Security comes under the current administration and those hired to take control of possible terrorisim are told what to over-look and what to not over-look. National policing of every citizen is not my idea of looking for possible terrorists. This smacks of the Nazi regime and we sure as hell don’t want that. We ‘seat’ some of the worst politicians in the entire world but we can also ‘un-seat’ them. We have to do OUR homework to know who are genuine public servants and not narcissistic prigs. If Obama’s cell phone calls and private papers were investigated, can you imagine the information that would be gathered? Scary. Transparency, my foot! ReplyLeave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

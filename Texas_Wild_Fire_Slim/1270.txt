	Former Eagles receiver Terrell Owens is advising current wideout Desean Jackson to hold out rather than risk injury.

Just days before the Eagles' season opener against the St. Louis Rams, Philadelphia wide receiver DeSean Jackson is being advised not to show up for the game. 
Who's giving Jackson this advice? None other than former Eagles route runner Terrell Owens. 
T.O. joined 97.5 The Fanatic with Mike Missanelli in Philadelphia on Tuesday and was asked if he would play in Week 1 if he were Jackson, who is embroiled in contract negotiations.
"Absolutely not," he said. "I would have to better myself and my family and my situation. That’s ridiculous."
Owens went on to say that if Jackson gets hurt, he would not get the contract "that he probably would have gotten if he held out."
As Yahoo's Shutdown Corner points out, Owens does make a good point, especially when you recall that the diminutive Jackson suffered a severe concussion last season after a violent collision with Falcons cornerback Dunta Robinson. 
Jackson, 24, is in the final year of his rookie deal and will earn $600,000 in 2011. The two-time Pro Bowler held out for 11 days and reported to training camp on August 9. 
Mike Florio of ProFootballTalk acknowledged that Jackson would be able to be more aggressive at the bargaining table and in the press if not for the "mess" T.O. created during his time in Philadelphia. 
When Owens wanted a new contract with the Eagles in 2005, he feuded with management and quarterback Donovan McNabb, eventually getting himself kicked off the team.

				I'm no huge T.O. fan but for once, I think he's talking wisdom here.  To risk injury-- that is, cause for no new contract-- is foolish.  It's like playing with zero insurance.  He's assuming all the risk.

Good advice from T.O...now if he could only get his own stuff together, he'd be a force with which to be reckoned.  LOL

				They told him they wouldn't renegotiat­e his contract unless he came to camp. It's now been a month since he showed up at camp, so where's the new deal? They opened the vault for Vick but not their best player? He should totally stay home and let them see what good all their new well paid free agents will do without number 10 out there.

				Screw him if he chooses to ignore his contact then the league owners should blackball him. What is it with these guys? They all grin like Cheshire cats during the initial signing, buy earrings worth more than my house, many go on to have lackluster performanc­es and then want to renegotiat­e before the old contract is up. Let him get a 9-5 in a steel mill or auto production line and try earning the money. Geez, you would think they are members of congress!

				The NFL will drop you like a bad habit if he gets hurt. The guy is underpaid per his performanc­e per league standards. You risk career ending injury at any time. Nothing wrong with sitting out under those circumstan­ces.

If any other sport play out your contract but nothing is guaranteed in the NFL.

				EXACTLY! You sign a Contract, then honor that contract. It could have done the other way, too. If a player sucks, they are still guaranteed a certain percentage (sometimes millions) even if they don't play.

				T.O. is currently unemployed­.  Anyone taking career advice from someone unemployed is an idiot.  Hopefully Desean is smarter than that and T.O.'s comments fall upon deaf ears.  Desean will get his contract but if he takes T.O.'s approach the birds will do the same thing with Desean as they did with T.O.

				What happens if he gets the contract he wants and then suffers a career ending injury?  Should the Eagles still pay the contract to term?  An NFL career is very very short, these players should not rely on getting paid large amounts in a few years so it lasts their entire life time.  You don't get to retire at 30!

				Why should he play.  I mean he only signed a contract!  He only used the integrity of his word and said he would live up to the terms he agreed to when he signed it.  

Heck, when he drops a ball, the Eagles should just take money out of his pay.  Why not.  Shouldn't the Eagles have the right to change the terms of the contract on a whim also?

				Does he deserve a pay bump?  Certainly.­.
Is he going to get one by emulating Owens?  Not even.
All that would get him is traded, if he's lucky.  
After all, there are plenty of other leagues willing to pay top dollar for an undersized­, injury prone player. /sarcasm

				God I cannot stand the eagles. Definitely my least favorite profession­al sports franchise. Living in Pennsylvan­ia totally validated that too. 

That being said, I do think jackson should hold out. If he got hurt tomorrow he would not be paid for being among the best at what he does in the league.

				He signed a contrat. What is so hard for people to understand about that legal committmen­t? They have insurance for injuries , if he does not have any he should be suing his agent! I'm so sick of these filthy rich crybabies. 600K, 6 million, 60 million, give us a break. For a guy to take a family of four to a game cost a whopping $250 for grandstand seats and likley another $100 for t-shirts and caps nevermind $8 beers $4 hot dogs and $15 mini pizzas. For what... to hear some guy complain about a SIGNED contact for 600Gs ? Puuuuuuuul­lleeeessss­eee !!!

				You can shoot the messenger but the message is accurate.  If he was my client, I would have him sit out.  Contracts are not binding in the NFL.  If Jackson gets hurt really bad, he could be cut, or at worst never get the big contract he most assuredly would get if he doesn't get hurt.  Too risky, hold out.  And this is coming from an Eagles fan, but I'm just being honest.

				Its call the NFL(Not For Long), he currently is under contract, so because he don't get a rework, he want show up base on the advise from someone who no team in the NFL want to be associated with due to his all about me BS, In most jobs one would be seeking other employment pulling a no show stunt. He need to take in considerat­ion that he is good however, there are players just as good or better chomping at the bits to get the opportunit­y he has. He need to take the advise from TO and flush it down the toilet!! and prove his worth.

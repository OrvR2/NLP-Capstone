Imperio has been a well received up-an-coming RDP app in what at times is a crowded field with big name players like Wyse, LogMeIn and Jaadu. The Imperio app has been featured as a highlight app in the Amazon AppStore and will soon be a part of the GetJar Gold program, additionally Imperio is now available on Samsung Apps who say, “The new Lite version has been chosen by invitation to join Samsung Apps and be featured among the top productivity apps.”
Lite and Lite Plus offer the same easy to setup app as the full version of Imperio (named for the Harry Potter ‘Imperius’ spell which allows the caster to control another person), while being supported by unobtrusive advertising. Users can upgrade to the full version from the Lite version to get access to additional features like remote sound access, Imperio’s unique ‘Touch Copy™’ file transfer system and Wake on LAN which allows you to wake up a sleeping computer from afar without the use of alarm clocks, roosters or large gongs. The $0.99 Lite Plus version of the app provides full user tech support while the free version does not.

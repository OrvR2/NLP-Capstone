April 18, 2011 – TULIA, Texas – Residents in Swisher County interested in learning how to protect themselves from wildfire are invited to a town hall meeting on April 26. The gathering is set for 7 p.m. at the Tulia High School Auditorium, 501 Hornet Place, Tulia. Representatives from Texas Forest Service and the Tulia Volunteer Fire Department will be on hand to answer questions and talk about what you can do to protect your home and family from wildfire. For example, you can reduce potential losses by adopting Firewise landscaping practices 100 to 200 feet around your home. That includes moving firewood and clearing dead and dense vegetation.Wildland Urban Interface Specialist Jan Fulkerson stressed that wildfires are a community-wide problem, which means reducing risks to homes and property is everyone’s responsibility.“More than 80 percent of wildfires in Texas occur within 2 miles of a community,” Fulkerson said, reminding residents that wildfires have raged through Swisher County before and likely will again. “We want to encourage residents to take proactive measures that could end up saving lives and property.”For more information, visit www.texasfirestorm.org and www.texasfirewise.org.

Yet again, Massachusetts has the most residents who have health insurance, and yet again, Texas has the most uninsured residents, according to a new Gallup report.
Massachusetts and Texas have taken the top and bottom spots, respectively, since Gallup and Healthways started conducting the health-care coverage surveys in 2008. 
And like the results from past years, more people in the northeast states have health insurance than people in the southern states, according to Gallup. 
The results of the poll are based on 177,237 interviews done between January and June 2011, as part of the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. The interviews revealed that 16.8 percent of Americans didn't have health insurance during the first half of 2011, slightly up from 16.4 percent in 2010. In 2008, 14.8 percent of American adults didn't have health insurance, according to Gallup.
Check out the rankings for the most-insured and least-insured states -- and find the complete rankings of all 50 states here.

				As uninsured MA resident, must note that MA insurance was about as high before Romney Care. That's the only reason it could pass, it didn't affect 93% of voters. None of my friends or family know anything about the bill. I didn't until after I retired and it affected me.A mandate was easy in MA, affected 5% of population­, and most of them got help from Medicaid funds to buy insurance. MA is rich state (2nd only to CT), fewer poor to fund. I'm not poor enough to get any help.Romney Care works in MA because few were forced to buy insurance. It won't work nationally where the uninsured rate is much higher. Taxpayers won't pay for the 40% uninsured in Texas to buy insurance, and they won't like being forced to pay for something they don't want.Dems should give up on a medical industry subsidy mandate*. It is a losing cause, a sure way to turn country over to Republican­s in 2012. Forcing people to give corporatio­ns profit - that's a Republican idea, came from one. Why Dems bought the idea, and insist it's the Progressiv­e thing to do, its beyond me.*it's not insurance, doesn't just require that you or insurer pay for own care. It's a collective­, everyone pays into pot so drugs and treatments are nearly-fre­e to all. Both MA and Fed require such as minimum plan, "catastrop­hic coverage" insurance doesn't satisfy mandate. Even if you don't take drugs, know the facts on their efficacy, know they don't work - you still are forced to buy them for those who do. Optional drugs, Viagra even, not drugs that cure anyone.

				Not very smart for any individual of any age not to have health insurance.­The main reason right now is that we have too many overweight people,you­ng and old and all studies confirm that there is a correlatio­n between weight and health.A relationsh­ip with a good doctor can steer the person in the right directions in all matters of health,inc­luding mental health.I would not be surprised that nations that provide good health care for it's citizens also have less crime and they live longer and happier lives.Unfo­rtunately our country is going in the opposite direction to the detriment of all of us as nation. Could some of the fatal  shootings going on have been avoided  by providing good health care to those individual­s?

				Massachuse­tts has the best rate of insured in the country and let there be no mistake about why.  It is because when Romney was governor he thought it was a great idea. It was.  

So why is Romney trying to distance himself from this achievemen­t rather being proud of it.  Could it be because the TParty doesn't approve and that Romney is trying to be all things to all people - which never works.   

Could it be because Pres. Obama wants the same system that does work in MA to work for the rest of the country but because the GNOP wants to hurt Obama that they are distancing themselves from something that actually works?  Why?  Because they hate Obama so much that they would rather point fingers at him rather than do what is really best for the country?

Think about it - why is Romney distancing himself from his one crowning achievemen­t as governor of Mass?  Why is he ashamed of the very program that Obama wants to duplicate?

				As a resident of NC (Western), it is obvious here the large number of uninsured. The frustratin­g thing is that they are not necessaril­y underserve­d, they are served in the most cost inefficien­t manner. In the mean time our regional "non-profi­t" mega-medic­al centers are constantly expanding and acquiring land (in many instances, from their own board members) and raising their prices to support their "charitabl­e efforts." My competent family physician recently became a part of the local hospital group because she could no longer afford her single practice and, as a result, the cost of a routine visit to her more than doubled. Of course, 100% of the added cost was passed to me as deductible and co-pay by my insurer. The medical industry is little more than a money machine for a select few and they do it all with tax-free status.

				TO: BlairCase

YOU WROTE:
A primary cause of difference in insurance coverage among states is the age of the population­­. With a median age of 32, Texas. The median age in Texas is nearly a decade younger than the median age in states that rank at the top of the list. Nearly 20% of the resident in some of the New England states are covered by Medicare.

ME TO YOU
You are 100% WRONG - The median age in Texas is NOT "nearly a decade younger than the median age in states that rank at the top of the list" as you FALSELY claim.

FACTS:
1. Massachuse­tts  Median Age 36 
-- 4 years difference - NOT Decade

2. Vermont Median Age 37
-- 5 years difference - NOT Decade

3. Minnesota Median Age: 35
-- 3 years difference - NOT Decade

4. Connecticu­t Median Age: 37
-- 5 years difference - NOT Decade

5. Hawaii Median Age: 36
-- 4 years difference - NOT Decade

6. Pennsylvan­ia Median Age: 38
-- 6 years difference - NOT Decade

7. Wisconsin Median Age: 36
-- 4 years difference - NOT Decade

8. Maryland Median Age: 36
-- 4 years difference - NOT Decade

9. New Jersey Median Age: 36
-- 4 years difference - NOT Decade

10. Delaware Median Age: 36
-- 4 years difference - NOT Decade

To Medicare: that's good that people have Medicare - it means they have insurance and can see a doctor BEFORE it is too late.

				According to the Boston Herald, "The figures from the 2010 Census released Thursday show the median age at 39.1 years, compared with 36.5 in 2000." That's seven years older than Texas. Other New England states are even older. http://new­­s.bostonh­e­rald.com­/n­ews/reg­ion­al/vie­w/20­11050­5cens­us_d­ata_sh­ow_­median_­ag­e_increa­s­e_in_mass­­/.

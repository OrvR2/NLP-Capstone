 Chicago News






In just its second year, Chicago's homegrown, hip hop- and electronic music-focused North Coast Music Festival is already proving that it is a worthy competitor for some of its larger, more established counterparts like Lollapalooza or Pitchfork Music Festival.
This year's edition, held over the Labor Day weekend at Union Park, offered a solid lineup including David Guetta, Fatboy Slim, Common, Thievery Corporation, Benny Benassi, of Montreal and Major Lazer -- all of whom entertained a near-capacity crowd, as Saturday and Sunday tickets to the festival, billed as "summer's last stand," sold out.
Miss out on the action this year? Be sure to catch up on coverage from our friends at Time Out Chicago, Gapers Block and Chicagoist and check out our gallery, featuring a selection of photos from the weekend, below:

				Really?  Comparing North Coast to Lollapaloo­za!? I'm all for North Coast but come on!  North Coast DOES NOT COMPARE TO LOLLAPALOO­ZA.  North Coast doesn't even compare to Electric Zoo.  Pitchfork ok sure I can see that but Lolla no freaking way.

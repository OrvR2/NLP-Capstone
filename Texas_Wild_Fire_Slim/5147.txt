Kate Hudson's estranged father and Goldie Hawn's ex-husband, Bill Hudson, is spilling family secrets in his tell-all book "2 Versions: The Other Side of Fame and Family," to be released in November. 
Hawn married Bill Hudson in 1976 and they divorced four years later. Together, they had two children: Kate and Oliver, who is also an actor. 
According to RadarOnline who obtained a copy of Hudson's book, it promises to shed some light on Bill's strained relationship with his ex-wife and children. 
And Bill Hudson really doesn't seem to be holding anything back. RadarOnline reports that in his book, Bill accused Kate of not visiting or calling her dying grandmother, who is batting Alzheimers disease. 
In the book, Bill writes, "I love Kate, but ... She has done stuff which is just awful. She is a spoiled brat in my eyes and at the end of the day, she should meet her little sister. I should meet my grandchild and she should help her grandmother."
Uh Bill, shouldn't you want to meet your grandchildren? 
Kate gave birth to son Ryder in 2004 and just this past July, she and Matthew Bellamy welcomed their son Bingham to the world.

				Reading most of these comments I can't help but notice how many people seem to form their opinion of this story based on their own experience­.  So---how many of you were personally involved in their lives all those years (no, reading tabloids faithfully doesn't count) and have first-hand knowledge of this family's interactio­ns?  No first-hand knowledge?  Didn't go to any holiday gatherings or family birthday parties?  Then stop being so bloody judgmental­!

				Of course she is a spoiled brat...why wouldn't she be? She has led a life of luxury, she is not particular­ly attractive­, she can't act. She is considered an actor and makes lots of money doing it. If her mother and father weren't who they are, she would have led the very ordinary life of the very ordinary.  Simple as that.

				You know, it doesn't matter if Kate is a "spoiled brat", the fact that her father writes a book about it, is loathsome.  This is not the way to mend a broken relationsh­ip with your daughter and at this late date to play the blame game is totally counterpro­ductive.  Maybe Bill has pain in his heart, but mostly he sounds angry and vindictive and trying to cause pain in Kate's life.  That's not how fathers who want a relationsh­ip act.

				Bill Hudson has no fame, no recognitio­n, nothing.  After Goldie left him he had no contact with the children (at least according to reports).  They were raised by Goldie and than with the help of Kurt Russell.  Bill just wants to get 15 minutes of fame, since his last 15 minutes of fame was in the 1970s.  He thinks his children owe him something, or it seems he thinks that Kate owes him something (not really sure why he's not harping on Oliver to hand over money too, since Oliver has a steady job on "Rules of Engagement­").  Nothing is being said from Goldie because he's not worth the effort to talk about.  Hopefully the book will bomb (as it is predestine­d to do) and he will crawl back under the rock he just crawled out of.

				This is precisely why she has no use for him. As far as she's concerned Kurt Russell is her father. 
I'll bet the guy's flat broke and knew he could make a buck by spewing this garbage.

				Having had to erase my biological father from my family tree, I can say without hesitation that this guy is so full of it, it's coming out his ears.
He's exhibiting very typical narcissist behavior.  Everything is about how he was wronged, he's owed something, everyone else did something wrong and he's just an innocent victim.
Well, cry me a river, Bill.

				Bill Hudson needs to get a life and move on already.  He is just looking for sympathy, and a way to get some attention.  He obviously was a lousy husband and father.  His daughter is doing better than he is.  What's he looking for?  That's right, it must be money because he is broke.  Too bad, so sad.  Kurt Russell took on the responsibi­lity of raising your kids and did a damn good job of it, and stood by Goldie's side from day one.  Bill go crawl back under the rock you came from.

				Bill Hudson's been whining for years. He and Goldie Hawn divorced in 1980. He married Cindy Williams in 1982 and Goldie began her relationsh­ip with Kurt Russell in 1983. Oliver was 4 and Kate, 1, when they divorced. Kurt Russell is the only father the 2 have ever known. Bill Hudson didn't stay involved in his kids lives and didn't even bother to send birthday cards. He's been trashing Hawn, Russell and the kids forever and a day. Why should Kate be expected to contact a grandmothe­r with Alzheimers that she doesn't even know and it's obvious Bill expects Kate to pick up the tab for grandma's treatment. The has-been's just trying to cash in on his daughter's fame with his one-sided tell all. The other side of the story has been out there for years and Hudson has been little more than a sperm donor to his children. Nasty book by a pathetic excuse for a father. Not worth the paper it's written on.

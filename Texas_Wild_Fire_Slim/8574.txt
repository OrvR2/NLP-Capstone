   LynnCo Supply Chain Solutions Named Top 100 3PL ProviderPRWeb – 50 mins ago





   Tulsa-based logistics company LynnCo Supply Chain Solutions, Inc. was chosen as one of the nation’s top 100 3PL (Third Party Logistics) providers by Inbound Logistics, a national trade publication. Each year, Inbound Logistics editors select the best logistics solutions providers by evaluating companies that offer diverse operational capabilities and experience, to meet customers' unique supply chain management and logistics needs.Tulsa, OK (PRWEB) September 08, 2011  Tulsa-based logistics company LynnCo Supply Chain Solutions, Inc. was chosen as one of the nation’s top 100 3PL (Third Party Logistics) providers by Inbound Logistics, a national trade publication. Each year, Inbound Logistics editors select the best logistics solutions providers by evaluating companies that offer diverse operational capabilities and experience, to meet customers' unique supply chain management and logistics needs.
“In today’s economic climate, it is required that a 3PL produce direct savings for customers by optimizing a transport network, reducing an inventory-to-sales ratio, or advancing the order-to-cash cycle. But it is just as important—in some cases more important—for a logistics partner to act as a business change agent, driving their customers’ ability to match demand for their products more closely to supply, aligning enterprise operational performance to the larger economic trend. That is what LynnCo does, and why we are happy to recognize them as a 2011 Top 100 3PL.” says Inbound Logistics editor Felecia Stratton.
LynnCo President Wendy Buxton says, “Globalization trends present new and ever-changing challenges to our clients’ supply chains. Increasing costs of extended supply chains; disruption and dislocation in markets and supply sources; security; compliance—all of these must be overcome by our clients while delivering world-class customer service. LynnCo’s logistics solutions have helped our clients overcome these challenges and allowed them to thrive—not just survive—in a volatile and demanding economic environment. Client and industry recognition of LynnCo as an elite 3PL—pioneering the path with best-in-class practices and tangible results—is truly the pinnacle honor for our company.”
Buxton went on to say, “This award is reflective of the team work and dedication of each of our employees. Their commitment and sensitivity toward the unique and demanding business needs of each of our clients drives each and every one of our employees to perform with excellence. We are proud of the service-focused culture instilled by our own employees and their willingness to be flexible and attentive to our clients’ needs. It is this steadfast execution that has allowed LynnCo to achieve such a prestigious ranking in a vast and competitive industry.”
LynnCo Supply Chain Solutions, Inc is a privately-held company founded by Lynn C. Fritz in 1991. Headquartered in Tulsa, OK, LynnCo leverages leading edge technology to provide cost-effective supply chain solutions on a global scale. More information is available at http://www.lynnco-scs.com.
Inbound Logistics is the leading trade magazine targeted toward business logistics and supply chain managers. The magazine's editorial mission is to help companies of all sizes better manage corporate resources by speeding and reducing inventory and supporting infrastructure, and better matching demand signals to supply lines.

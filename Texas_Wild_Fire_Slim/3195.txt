In Peru, climate change is already a troubling daily reality. Peru’s arid coast depends largely on glacial run-off for its water supply, especially during the long dry season. In the past 30 years, the country has lost 22 percent of its glacier area, according to a recent study by the World Bank. Unless new ways to manage and store water can be found, Peruvians will face severe problems in the coming decades.

				There is no such thing as Climate Change to a TPublican. To the rest of the world, it's a big deal. Unfortunat­ely Obama's receint further caving to the TPublicans on environmen­tal issues and his upcoming approval of the Tar Sands pipeline through the US will only make things worse.

Donate Goods
 
 If you have goods to donate for the Labor Day fires, please click on this button to register.  At this time, it might be better to donate cash as the needs for recovery have not been identified.  Contact:  vicky@mcuw.org or carla@mcuw.org if you are having difficulties registering and we will walk you through the process.  Thanks for your help in this time of need.


Volunteer
 
 If you want to volunteer to help someone affected by the Labor Day Fires, please register.  There are not as many opportunities at this time because most short term needs have been met.  Long term recovery efforts will be forthcoming and additional opportunities will be available later.  Please register so we can contact you as soon as we hear more news.  Thanks for your help in our community!

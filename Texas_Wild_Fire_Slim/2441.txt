If you're going to be watching the GOP Presidential debate tonight, you might as well have fun while doing so. And with the help of our official drinking game below, you shouldn't have any problem.
You might already be familiar with our State Of The Union drinking games, but this one is tailored specifically for tonight's debate. 
What will Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum reveal about their platforms tonight? Whether it's talk of "job creators," "taking back America," or "Obamacare," we've covered (most of) the bases and paired them with funny drinking "suggestions." Be safe and have fun!
NOTE: The Huffington Post in no way encourages binge drinking. This is the comedy section. If you actually drank as much as we suggested you would die, so do not do that.


Sept. 7, 2011 GOP Debate Drinking Game

EventInstructions
Rich people referred to as "job creators"Allocate enough liquor for two more players but don't specify where it will come from
Bachmann misquotes history Take a sip of beer, which was invented by the French in the year 1647
Perry actually shows up instead of saving his state from burning down
Do two shots
Someone mentions " Speechgate"Wait for your friend to do a shot and then do one yourself, angrily
"Don't tax the rich!"Take alcohol away from the 5% of players who have had the most drinks already
Sarah Palin namedrop
Make everyone think you're going to drink so they'll pay attention to you, but never actually do it
Someone says "Obamacare"Do a shot
Someone says "Obamneycare"Do two shots
Someone says "Obama is a Muslim"Throw your beer at the TV
Herman Cain touts pizza-related experienceDip a slice of pizza in your beer and eat in one bite
Romney talks about his jobs planTake 59 tiny sips of whatever is left on the coffee table
Candidate smirks and shakes his/her head while being verbally attackedDrink something bitter and act like you like it
Any candidate reverses global warming/evolution stancePour yourself a shot and then throw it away
Ron Paul says we should return to a precious metals standardDrink a shot of Goldschlager
Someone compares Perry to Bush
Drink your next drink out of a boot
Moderator displays "relevant" tweetsTweet a photo of the beer you're about to finish
Bachmann speaks for God Take one drink and do five Hail Marys
Someone says "Take back our country"
Steal the beer of the person next to you
The entire debate finishes without anyone mentioning "Real America"Drunkenly call your Congressperson and list your grievances

				I don't think Newt Gingrich understand­s the concept of debate if he doesn't want the candidates to be pitched against one another.

I think I've figured out Mitt Romney's secret plan: He's going everything on "day one," then take a 364 day vacation.

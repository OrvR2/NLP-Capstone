@nailyk of course I'm more concerned about the people. It was just after the fact﻿ that I thought of the animals as well.

Did God inflict a drought and wildfires on Texas because he's upset with Texans for electing Perry?
Imagine the devastaion he would﻿ inflict on USA if Perry becomes president.

@tgusey A big chunk of Rick's Texas miracle is construction on military bases like Forts Hood and Bliss and Sam Houston, each of which is experiencing a multi-billion-dollar building boom. The construction is done by private-sector contractors and so does indeed generate jobs, but in truth those jobs wouldn't exist if the Feds weren't showering all this money on Texas.
And Gov. Perry TAKES CREDIT FOR HIS STATE HAVING HUGE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESOURSES..WTF........﻿

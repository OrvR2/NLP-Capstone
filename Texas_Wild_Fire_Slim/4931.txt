Freestone coal mine to close, costing about 200 jobs

Texas power giant Luminant will close the lignite mine that feeds the Big Brown power plant in Fairfield, in Freestone County, switching to cleaner- burning Wyoming coal as part of a hasty effort to meet new federal air regulations by Jan. 1.
The company Monday said the regulations will cause it to close three lignite mines statewide and idle two lignite-burning power units in East Texas. Luminant said those actions will cost 500 jobs in Texas and decrease its overall power capacity by 9 percent.
Luminant broke the news Monday to the 210 workers at the Turlington Mine that serves Big Brown, but it has not decided who will be laid off, or when, company officials said.
Big Brown in Freestone County is among three lignite-burning power plants whose operations Luminant said it will have to curtail under a new U.S. EPA rule. David J. Phillip / Associated Press
“We have hundreds of employees who have spent their entire professional careers at Luminant and its predecessor companies,” Luminant CEO David Campbell said.
“At every step of this process, we have tried to minimize these impacts, and it truly saddens me that we are being compelled to take the actions we’ve announced today,” he said. “We have filed suit to try to avoid these consequences.”
Luminant filed a lawsuit Monday with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., seeking to invalidate the Environmental Protection Agency’s Cross-State Air Pollution Rule in Texas.
That rule requires industries in high-polluting states to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and ozone-forming nitrogen oxide. In July, Texas was added to the list of states that had to reduce sulfur dioxide by nearly half by 2012.
The new rule and its short implementation timeline have been criticized by  Gov. Rick Perry and  numerous state agencies, including the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the Texas Railroad Commission and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.
ERCOT, which controls most of Texas’ power grid, said the power generation taken offline because of the new regulations could cause electricity shortages.
If the power reductions had taken place this summer, Texas would have seen rolling blackouts, said Trip Doggett, CEO of ERCOT.
“Things can’t happen fast enough with resource owners to comply with the rule without it having a negative reliability impact,” Doggett said, according to an  Associated Press report.
Luminant announced that its actions will reduce its generation capacity by  1,300 megawatts, enough electricity to power about  260,000 Texas homes during the peak of summer.
The most drastic cuts come at the Monticello power plant in Northeast Texas, which will see two of its three units idled and the third switched to Powder River Basin coal from Wyoming.
The supporting lignite plants near Sulphur Springs and Mount Pleasant will close. Big Brown, some  85 miles east of Waco, already was supplementing its lignite with Wyoming coal but will now switch completely.
Powder River Basin coal burns hotter, cleaner and more efficiently than lignite, the lowest grade of coal and the most bountiful in Texas.
Texas environmental groups hailed Luminant’s decision as a victory for clean air and people who suffer from respiratory ailments.
Sierra Club air-quality officials have said Big Brown’s nitrogen oxide pollution could contribute to ozone smog in Waco.
A regional air-quality task force still is awaiting data from a consultant that will attempt to quantify that influence.
In the meantime, civic leaders in Fairfield are worried about the future of their community. Big Brown and its mine employ an estimated 600 Luminant workers and contractors, making it by far the largest and best-paying industry in Freestone County, which has a population of about 10,000.
Vanessa Dotson, Fairfield Chamber of Commerce president, said the mining jobs can’t be easily replaced.
“When you ask, ‘Where else in Freestone County can they find work?,’ the answer is not good,” she said. “They’ll have to move or seek employment at a much lower pay grade.”
She said the loss of the mine would have economic ripple effects.
“We’ll feel it immediately,” said Dotson, a small-business owner. “Our local shops aren’t going to be shopped as much and we’re going to have a significant drop in property tax revenue.”
Luminant paid $8.6 million in taxes to local government last year.

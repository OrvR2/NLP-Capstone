       September 9, 2011-- Robert Greenwald writes his version of Obama's jobs speech on Alternet: “Good evening. To get American working again, we must cut our massive war budget and find better ways to spend that money. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.” He continues to say that beyond war industry hype, military spending costs Americans jobs. The Political Economy Research Institute’s 2009 study reveals that for every $1 billion spent for military purposes it costs Americans 3,222 jobs and even worse at the upper end of war spending costs are 17,500 or more jobs per billion dollars. Based on this equation, the $700 billion we are spending every year on war is killing our economy. “War spending is good at making a few corporations very rich at the expense of the rest of us, however. Take Lockheed Martin, for example. Lockheed is the top contractor for both the Pentagon (.pdf) and the U.S. government in general (.xls), having made $35.8 billion off the taxpayer in 2010. Just to put that in perspective, if they were an “official” arm of the U.S. government, their taxpayer-funded budget, ironically, would be roughly three times the size of the Department of Labor (.pdf). Their CEO, Robert J. Stevens, made $21.9 million dollars last year, or $10,527.80 per hour. That’s a pretty sweet deal for the head of a company whose two marquee products, the F-22 and the F-35, have yet to see action in a war-zone because they aren’t safe or don’t work.” President Obama’s jobs speech is on the same day as the first meeting of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, known to us as the “Super Committee.” Will cuts to the war budget be at the top of their agenda? Mr Greenwald reports that corporations like Lockheed Martin realize that if Congress does move forward with job creation their days of “living-high-on-the-[government] hog” will be over. Further war profiting corporations have banded together under the banner of a front group, “Second To None,” to pressure the committee and other influentials on the Hill to protect their profits. [See Nick Turse's excellent piece on AlterNet today detailing just who is behind the Second To None effort.] They plan to stage a “march to the Hill” on Tuesday, and with members of the so-called “Super Committee” having taken well over a million dollars in campaign and PAC contributions from these war profiteers, there’s a real danger that Second To None could “cash in,” corrupting the process to shield their job-killing profits. We want to have faith in our government and believe and trust our elected officials, but when reports like this reveal how campaign donations sully the process tipping the scales in favor of the war machine, it’s difficult to trust. In a recent article in Aljazeera, Noam ChomskyNoam Chomsky quotes Eric Margolis, “A number of analysts have observed that although bin Laden was finally killed, he won some major successes in his war against the U.S." He repeatedly asserted that the only way to drive the US from the Muslim world and defeat its satraps was by drawing Americans into a series of small but expensive wars that would ultimately bankrupt them -- "Bleeding the U.S.," in his words. How long does America have to bleed before the government realizes they are fulfilling bin Laden’s prophecy even after his death?        1 of 2

"We want to have faith in our government and believe and trust our elected officials..."Yeah, right; I'd like to believe in Santa Claus, but I'm older now and have better sense. I never put my faith in government, regardless of who is in power; doing so, from my perspective, seems a trifle naive; I put my faith in myself and God, and watch everyone else like a hawk...

Thank you for commenting Hardy.A friend of mine who is an Independent was teasing me the other day and said I might have to turn in my "bleeding heart badge." Never I say! You mean there is no Santa Claus! People like us Hardy keep abreast of what's going on, and I venture to say few people care to do it. So they read what everyone else is doing, and go with the flow. Well, I dont do that and neither do you. However, I trust our Democratic system over other forms of government. Democracy is messy as many have stated, but its the best system out there. Trust, but verify is a good practice. At least we have freedom of speech and assembly, so we can cite our views and no one can tell us not to! Thats a form of faith, is it not?

I trust the system, but our government is always in the process of trying to side-step the system; the Super Committee in and of itself is unconstitutional; all spending bills must originate in the House of Representatives. The Super Committee is essentially taxation without representation.

I am no fan of Reagans since he closed almost all the mental hospitals in California and set up the rich forever with his Reganomics, but the maxim is a good one. I wish someone else had said it first.

Thank you to all who commented.Reducing the defense budget rests with the Super Committee now, and they only have until November to show us their mettle. Let's hope they have the courage to make the right choices.

I would love to believe that it is possible to have an honest government that remembers they are working for the people of this nation and not for themselves. Then again, I keep thinking the offers Bank of America keeps sending my dear friend, Author Bradley S. Hartman are legit and he will be able to keep his home. There is and always was, only one solution to the job problem in the U.S.A., and that is to make American companies, who are making their profits off Americans, keep the jobs here and not parcel them out to the cheapest foreign country they can find. America used to be about pride and quality, my parents used to come home and talk with the sense of both because they worked with their hands for good pay and put out a quality product or service. Today that is a thing of the past, that we have a hard time explaining when our children ask about it. To achieve anything that will resemble anything close to the pride and well-being of American citizens, we have to re-structure not only the government, but also the corporate world that is shunning us from jobs, pride and the craftsmanship that made us number one in the world.

Well written piece Dava. I have had a little experience with the workforce that is out in the world in the last ten years. When I would work with an older person (over) 25 they did most always take pride in what they did. When I would work with those younger than 25 I wanted to go outside and scream. You talk about a generation that feels entitled we got it. They don't think they have to work as hard to keep the job cause they can go get another one. They have no respect for anyone or anything. I asked one young person one time "What would you do if you were served that food?" They told me "I would throw it in their face." "And if someone did that to you?" " I would go and beat the sh*t out of them." Not a hint of what I was getting at. I have a bad feeling that American Pride is a distant memory from what I saw. When I see respectful teens I try to find a parent or adult with them and tell them I appreciate the effort to raise the child correctly. Blame the politicians and the economy but pride in ones efforts need to begin at home and it is not happening. Sorry Dava I just thought I would make this quick but I did like the story.

OrakulI think you are commenting on the wrong thread. My article is about defense spending. I have no idea what you are referring to in relationship to defense spending and the Super Committee.

Thanks for the report Dava but by now we know the end results. Our government has become painfully predictable! The party of no, the Republicans continue to do what they have become very adept at.... the Democrats continue to play catch-up and the President continue to bang his head against a brick wall of hypocrites. He hasn't learned how to scale or go around that wall.

Thanks for commenting Veronica.The Super Committe, which is half and half, has a chance to show us if they are capable of the tough choices, and cutting defense spending is about as controversial as they come.

Update





Blaze on Mount Hood grows

HOOD RIVER, Ore. (AP)  A blaze fueled by lichens and mosses burning in treetops on the north side of Mount Hood grew considerably overnight and moved a mile to the north, fire officials said Sunday.
The Dollar Lake fire had burned about 5,800 acres and was 35 percent contained as of Sunday afternoon.
The blaze is expected grow as warmer, drier weather and decreased humidity was forecast for Sunday, fire spokesman Mike Heilman said.
The fire, which was ignited Aug. 27 during a lightning storm in the Mount Hood Wilderness, is burning about 20 miles southwest of Hood River. It is 3 miles from the Bull Run Watershed, which supplies 900,000 people in Portland with water, and 9 miles from the closest communities to the west.
"We're trying to work on the northwest finger of the fire that would be the closest to all of those high value resources," fire spokesman Earl Cordes said Sunday afternoon. That northwest corner has been a priority for crews because of it is the closest to communities, the watershed and transmission lines, he said.
Fire officials warned that smoke and ash from the blaze could drift several miles toward communities in the west and southwest. The ash may be fine dust or even larger material but is usually cold by the time it gets there and people shouldn't be concerned that it would start fires when it lands, officials said.
At midday Sunday, a warm air thermal cap  called an inversion  continued to hang over the fire, not allowing it to breath and keeping it in check.
"Mother nature has been dictating how this fire is burning. We're trying to react to the weather and trying to stay ahead of it," Cordes said.
Fire officials are a marine flow will bring cooler temperatures and higher relative humidity, providing crews with some relief.

Update




Man falls from overpass onto I-5 in Portland

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP)  A 31-year-old man tumbled to his death Sunday after he fell from an overpass onto Interstate 5 in Portland.
Portland police and medical personnel found the man down on the freeway's northbound lanes. Police say it appears he fell over the railing of the North Williams Avenue overpass onto I-5.
Witnesses told police the man may have been reaching for something prior to falling. Police received reports of his fall around 11:30 a.m. Sunday.
Police say the man's identity won't be released until his family has been notified.

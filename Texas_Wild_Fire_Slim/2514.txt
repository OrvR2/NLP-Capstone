A man driving on the South Side early Monday was shot in the head -- but still managed to drive himself to a nearby hospital. 
The Chicago Tribune reports that the victim was a 36-year-old man, and was wounded in the 1300 block of East 74th Street about 12:03 a.m. The bullet was possibly fired from another vehicle. 
Despite his injury, the man was alert enough to drive himself to Jackson Park Hospital, which was about six blocks away, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. 
The man was later taken to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County and listed in serious condition. No arrests have been made, and a motive in the shooting was not immediately known.

				There are areas in any large city were you should not drive. I am sure I am going to get a lot of flack from this, but if you find yourself in an area such as a black or a Latino “ghetto“, better get yourself out of there ASAP. Most people are smart enough not to going into these areas except for those who live in them.....

				If the laws on the books were enforced it would make a big difference­. In VA there is a law that you have to get additional time in jail for any Felony crime where a gun was used. It is an additional charge of "use of a firearm in the commission of a felony". The problem is that the judges don't like to be told that they have to do something. The will change a conviction of a felony to a misdemeano­r to avoid giving the additional time. Saw a guy shoot his wife, fortunatel­y she lived, cause the judge found him guilty of assault rather than the felony, so he could dismiss the gun charge.

				There can never be enough police to handle everything quickly that may come about.  That is why law-abidin­g citizens should have the right to own a firearm for their personal protection­.  I'm not talking about out in the streets or in your car, but in your own home.  Personal safety at home is very important and self-prote­ction is a right.  Sometimes, that is all you will have to save your own life or that of a loved one, because these gang-types and other crazies just don't care about you.

				you're absolutely right cap! I live alone and own a handgun and I'm not afraid to use it if necessary. I am totally against gun control because all it will do is keep citizens like myself from owning a gun legally, but criminals will always find a way to get them. I live in Kentucky and have visited Chicago. I would never live there! I hope this man recovers and that he was able to get himself to the hospital. God Bless!

				If you are going to use a firearm for self protection­, why limit its use to your home only. Any law abiding citizen should be able to carry a weapon for self protection anywhere. Personal safety anywhere is as important as just safety at home.  The victim in this case was not at home when he was shot.....I have a hard time believing this took place at all.  I mean after all, Chicago has some of the toughest gun laws in America...

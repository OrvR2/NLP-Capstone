USS Iowa to be moved to LA to be battleship museumBy SHAYA TAYEFE MOHAJER - Associated Press | AP – 17 hrs ago

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The USS Iowa — the last surviving World War II battleship without a home — will head to the Port of Los Angeles to stand as a permanent museum and memorial to battleships, the Navy said Tuesday.The nonprofit Pacific Battleship Center, which has been working to bring the ship to Los Angeles, beat out the San Francisco Bay area city of Vallejo. The Navy's decision also comes six years after the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted against making a public display of the ship in that city, citing local opposition to the Iraq war and the military's stance on gays, among other things.The nearly 900-foot battleship must be rehabilitated in San Francisco Bay before it can be towed down the California coast, Pacific Battleship Center president Robert Kent said. That should happen in late October, when unusually high tides are expected in the bay, he said.The Iowa's new home will offer 4 1/2 acres of parking space in North America's busiest seaport, adjacent to the World Cruise Center, where cruise ships dock and flocks of tourists could tour the Iowa."Our focus for our museum will be on the history of the battleships, not only the Iowa being the ultimate in design, but we'll be focusing from the very beginnings" of the massive vessels, Kent said.President Franklin Roosevelt traveled home aboard the USS Iowa after the 1943 Tehran conference of allied leaders, where he met with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to plan war strategies against Nazi Germany.The 45,000-ton ship, which towers 15 stories above the water line, engaged in battles in the Pacific theater during World War II and entered Tokyo Bay with the occupation forces in 1945 where it served as Admiral William F. Halsey's flagship for the surrender ceremony. The battleship later served off Korea's eastern shores during that conflict.In 1989, the USS Iowa suffered one of the nation's deadliest military accidents after 47 sailors were killed in an explosion during a training exercise. Before being decommissioned in 1990, it served as an escort for oil tankers in the Persian Gulf.The Iowa was towed to San Francisco from Rhode Island in 2001, after Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., helped secure $3 million to bring it to San Francisco in hopes of making it a tourist attraction at Fisherman's Wharf. Four years later, Feinstein, a former San Francisco mayor, called the city's supervisors' 8-3 vote against the idea a "very petty decision."The Iowa's sister boats are already serving as museums: The USS Missouri is docked at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, the USS Wisconsin is docked in Norfolk, Va., and the USS New Jersey is docked in the state it is named for.The Iowa and the Wisconsin will be maintained to avoid rust and other mechanical problems in the unlikely event the ships are ever needed in war, Kent said.

That wasn't no accident.  Some gay sailor caused it because he was jilted.

They should move one to Monterey California as it was the first capitol of California.
My son and I have stayed over night on the Pompanito submarine in San Francisco and the aircraft carrier USS Hornet in Alameda when he was in the scouts. 
I think it is a great thing for history and education.

actually, i heard Obama is painting a bunch of ships. He's gonna call it the "Great Black Fleet." He's gonna disarm all of them, then send the fleet around the world in an apology tour The tour's motto..."Walk loudly while being beaten by you're own stick!"

I've ridden boats in Suisun Bay and seen the mighty Iowa sitting there, I'm glad she has finally found a home with people who will take care of her. I've toured her sister ships, and the older battleships like the Massachusetts and the Texas. These ships served their country in our proudest moments and most heroic fashion, they should never be forgotten.

Good! San Francisco doesn't deserve the USS Iowa or any military museum as for that matter. Nor does it deserve any protection from our military! In a city with a majority of the population where the women are women and the men are too who hate our military, successfully banned ROTC programs and recruiting offices anywhere within the city limits, there is nobody there to defend except for the very small number of veterans and faithful who still reside there and love our military. 

The once proud City of San Francisco was a military-friendly city years ago, especially during the Second World War, where troops serving in the Pacific Theater returned home or shipped out. The City boasted nightclubs, USO programs and other lively entertainment as well as offering affordable accommodation at some of the finest hotels for our troops. That's the San Francisco I liked! Much better than the dismal crap that is running the City today, filled with the sick girlie wusses and sissies who look upon those in uniform as "baby killers" and go as far as spitting on them.

Navy ships carry their number painted on the bow. That cannot be the stern of the Iowa. It is the bow of a support ship of some sort.

Don't forget the battleship North Carolina, docked in Wilmington, NC. Great museum. Can even climb into the turrets where the big guns were loaded and fired.

1951. Task Force 77, North Korean coast, the Missouri, Iowa, New Jersey, and half a dozen destroyers, all firing at once while flights from the Boxer and Philippine Sea burn the hills with napalm. Unbelivable experience. Probably why I don't hear well today.

If you're in Camden, NJ you can visit the USS New Jersey (BB62) and look across the Delaware River at the USS Olympia (Commodore Dewey's flagship). Of course if you're in Philly you can visit the Olympia and look at the New Jersey. Its amazing how only about 50 years separates "state of the art" design at the time these ships were in their prime!

Battleships are are awesome! from USS Maine to USS Wisconsin, THAT was "power projection".  It would have been really cool had they built the "Montana" class which was the follow on to the "Iowa" class and larger yet. SUPER Dreadnaughts!  That said, "Yamato" was even larger (18" guns!) until we sunk her.  Don't forget USS Texas, last of the WWI Dreadnaughts preserved in her home state.  Yeah, I'm into capital ships, and I'm retired Air Force!

Stewart rips media over "Speechgate"By Tim Molloy | Reuters – 18 hrs ago

By Tim Molloy
NEW YORK (TheWrap.com) - Fresh from vacation, "The Daily Show" host Jon Stewart finally weighed in on the petty debate over the scheduling of President Obama's jobs speech -- the one that would have been held Wednesday night but was moved to Thursday at the request of House Majority Leader John Boehner.
Playing clips in which talking heads said Obama had caved to Republicans, Stewart offered another possibility: He had made a reasonable accommodation. But conflict-hungry reporters could never accept such a thing, he said.
"See, this is why I hate the 24-hour news cycle. Well, among the reasons," Stewart said. "They've turned our Tale of Reasonable Accommodation into a Tale of Manufactured Conflict."
He noted that in a White House press conference following the decision, "there were 23 questions about the scheduling of the speech. Nine about its content."
In asking Obama to move his address to Congress, Boehner cited a busy House schedule and the need for special security precautions. But many speculated that he didn't want the speech to conflict with a Republican presidential debate.
Correspondent John Oliver explained why the decision about whether to watch the speech or the debate would have been harder than "Sophie's Choice."

I don't like Obama's policies and I don't particularly like Jon Stewart, but the media was inviting more conflict with the coverage.  The fact is that whoever was responsible in Obama's camp for this fiasco should be fired, unless it really was a power play by Obama.  I can't know that.  If it was, then he deserved the press.  If it wasn't and was an oversight, he should be given credit for making the accommodation.  So was it a power play that backfired? I never questioned the intelligence in the beginning - but only his lack of experience.  Lately - gee, I just don't know.

America has become land of the stupid, home of the hateful. The Republicans wont be happy until they gte back into power to finish the job Bush started of destroying the country. Not that Obama is any better. But at least he is intelligent.

It's like sarcasm...you either get it or you don't. Those who think that Jon Stewart speaks intelligently and incisively about the political landscape, you are a thoughtful and nimble-minded person. Those who think Jon Stewart is just a comedian who holds no worth to the political conversation of this country, you lack intelligence and the ability to be a reason without swimming in your own hatred...and no amount of name calling will change that.

Jon Stewart, Israel, Tea Partiers, Republicans, Liberals, conservatives, Democrats, and Obama are names that  invoke anger in someone. I'm certain there are others that have similar effects. Questions as to why abound! Answers are in a book titled: "God's Continuing Word - A Personal Message"

Stewart got it right as he does on every once in a while but , try to remember he has a staff of leftwing writters that get paid to lampoon. The Daily Show is Not the news, If you can't laugh at your selves don't watch it. I'm one of those S.O.B, Barbarian at the gate, Bible toten, Radical Rightwingers and his show still cracks me up. On another note, does it any of you when Obama uses the word," Folks"? I dont't think he knows anything about folks!

We need to turn the news off, and then maybe they will get the point.  Good News is news and actually the only news, the rest is a nuisance.

For a person who hates religion, Jon Stewart has a  very holier than thou attitude of liberal indigation.

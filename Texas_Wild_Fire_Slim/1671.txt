A new video game is giving players a chance to explore a post-apocalyptic Fox News studio and kill off zombies that resemble famous conservatives including Michele Bachmann, Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Bill O’Reilly and Glenn Beck.
The game, called "Tea Party Zombies Must Die," is project by StarvingEyes Advergaming, a website that provides games for online viral campaigns.
Other characters in the first-person shooter include the "Generic Pissed Off Old White Guy Zombie," the "Pissed Off Stupid White Trash Redneck Birther Zombie" and the "Express Racist Views Anonymously On The Internet Modern Klan Zombie," who dons the remains of a KKK robe as he wanders around with a sign that describes President Barack Obama as a Muslim
You can see some of the characters in the game in this video from MRC TV:


According to National Review Online, players get "informative tidbits" between levels about how Obama's health care plan lowers the deficit, and "how most Republicans think the president is a Muslim."
Jason Oda, the head of StarvingEyes, told MRC TV the game was a personal project and downplayed the criticism coming from conservative circles.
"I am not worried about it affecting business," Oda said.

				Unfortunat­ely, this is all too typical of liberal hypocracy.  If this were they other way around, the majority of you on here would be absolutely livid.  Because it is targeting conservati­ves, everyone's saying "It's just a game, it's no big deal, get a sense of humor,etc.­etc."  Liberals claim to be open-minde­d and accepting when, in fact, liberals are, by far, the most closed-min­ded, cruel, nasty group of people in the world.  Congrats to all of you.  You're just so edgy and cool.  Truly pathetic.

				LOL, that is awesome! Now I would like to see the Tea Party have one made to level things out. They could make one showing the world with Obama in power for another 4 years. The world would be full of abortion loving homosexual­s attempting to persuade illegals to work their organic gardens. The weapon of choice would no longer be guns since they have been banned. Instead the player will be armed with a feathers and have to run around and tickle the illegals in order to recruit them. The object of the game is to grow your garden so large that it eliminates tornadoes, hurricanes­, earthquake­s, flooding, and other man made disasters such as these. The game ends the same no matter how high of a score you receive when Iran nukes the U.S. and Al Gore is the only American that survives..­....

				Ok, let me start off by saying that I'm not into video games never have been, I also think they aren't that great for kids, when my kids were at home they were limited, and the content was looked at till they got older..I have a son and a husband in the military, Army (husband) Marines (son)...so with that said I am seeing many post that are accusing HP of being far to liberal, and that they have it out for republican­s, what's humorous is the fact when they have a derrogator­y story of libs, I then hear how HP is on the side of the teaparty..­.Relax all it's just a game, yes obviously violent, but if we took all the games out there, we would be one F****d up society: Oh, hold it we are:)

				Conservati­ves should be proud. This game was developed by liberals who are embracing right-wing ideals:

Support for guns and the use of force to solve problems
Capitalism (I'm sure they intend to make money off the game, or at least from the attention it generates for their company)
Strong work ethic (they got off their butts and took their future in their own hands - no waiting for government handouts here)

				You bet I'm proud for them! I am conservati­ve and I LOVE the idea of this game --- I think it is hilarious!­!! Kudos to the guys who developed it. The concept is entirely unoriginal­, but the subject matter it is applied to is great!!! I only wish that I had thought of it!

I do have one question though: How would the left react if a conservati­vely-orien­ted company had developed this game? Where you got to kill Obama, Biden, Reid, Pelosi (opps, I forgot, she really IS a zombie!!), Feinstein, Boxer, Schumer, Kennedy(s)­, etc???
I'm betting the uproar from the left and their media lackeys would be deafening!­!! But perhaps not. Just an interestin­g thought/co­ncept for your considerat­ion.

				Remember the tea party said it was free speech when Sarah Palin put a Gabrielle Giffords in the crosshairs on her website.  They said it was free speech when Sharon Angle started talking about "second amendment remedies" if she lost the election.  The game is distastefu­l but the hypocrisy of the right wing is telling.

				Liberal Democrats by nature are unstable and anything that gives them any crediblity is dangerous. Liberals do not want to believe in God so they make up a god like messiahs like Obama, mother earth and global warming. They elevate the creation over the Creator and lose their mind when their creations lets them down.  Liberals using the French Revolution as their avenue for change have been behind every murderous and destructiv­e act this country has experiance­d internally since John Wilkes Booth. Liberals seeking change have been behind all of the presidenti­al assasinati­ons, the Weather Undergroun­d activities of Bill Ayres and the Manson Murders. Egging on the liberal is dangerous and the Obama Democrats should be ashamed of themselves

				Grow up it is a game that most of us would like to play. It is not the fault of the manufactur­es but yet the blame lies with the pathetic radical stand that is so Antiu American that the Tea Party stands for. They hate America and want to rewtite history and the future. We are a progessive country and that will never change. The Tea Party will have its say and then go off with it'sher) tail between her/ his legs.

On August 13th, 2007, the Cascade Complex wildfires - in Central Idaho - overran a fire camp where several hundred firefighters and support personnel were camped.  The fire's arrival was not a surprise, the fire that threatened the camp had been burning with similar intensity in similar fuel types for over 2 weeks before this incident occurred. For background on the events leading up to this event, read:http://fusee.blogspot.com/2007_08_01_archive.htmlThis video was shot by Alex Park, and later sent anonymously to fusee.org.

I thought﻿ this summer's fires were promoting forest health by creeping through the underbrush and thinning out all the tiny trees. That's what we've been told. Over 2,000,000 acres in Idaho alone have received this "treatment" this summer. Is this forest health or forest extinction?

mike,
we haven't heard many people try to describe the idaho fires as being low-intensity. most of the land burned by the cascade complex is in what fire ecologists call a 'low-frequency, high-severity' fire regime - that is, these forests don't burn for years, and then they REALLY burn (example yellowstone 1987). ﻿
the burned forests will recover - this is what they have done since lightning was invented.

Looks like an excellent﻿ location for a Firecamp; making travel costs minimal and firefighter access extremely efficient!

Fire is and can be very beneficial to the landscape.﻿ One of the reasons why fires these days can be so hot and out of control, is because we, as humans have suppressed them. The Native Americans knew how to use fire correctly, to their benefit. Under their care, fire was used to keep the land in a much more natural state then it is in now.

Reports claim that the fire﻿ was caused by a burst of hot air from Howard Stern's anus.

Most of the Yellow Jackets were contractors,﻿ Such as supply/cooking meals etc. However, as my self and other pilots that were there moved our aircraft just prior to this. Saw it coming. I believe the person in charge was instantly relieved of his duties.

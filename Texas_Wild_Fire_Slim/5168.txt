Muslims feel growing hostility as 9/11 anniversary approaches and ‘Ground Zero mosque’ is builtBy New York Daily News | The Upshot – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

NY Daily News

Worshippers attend the Friday afternoon prayer service at the Park51 Community Center on Park Place. (Bryan Smith …

The scent of incense fills the room as the faithful gather quietly  for afternoon prayers, their hands turned toward the ceiling, their  shoes lined along the back wall.
Outside, an NYPD van sits in the sunshine. Dozens of metal police barricades line the sidewalk bordering 51 Park St. - aka the controversial Ground Zero mosque.
"People are not welcome anymore building mosques in neighborhoods," says Mohammed Aziz, 49, who joined a diverse crowd of cops, MTA workers and financial wizards at the crowded service.
"We didn't experience that before 9/11."
The day Islamic terrorists brought down the World Trade Center changed life in many ways - some dramatic, others subtle - for the city's 600,000 Muslims.
Either way, NYPD crime stats show the change was almost instantaneous.
Between Jan. 1, 2001, and Sept. 10, 2001, police reported zero bias  incidents against Muslims. In the 112 days after the twin towers  toppled, there were 96, nearly one a day.
Things slowly returned to normal, with zero incidents reported in 2004 - although many Muslims felt a growing sense of unease.
Their fears were confirmed last year when a national furor erupted  over the Park St. mosque. Bias attacks on Muslim New Yorkers tripled  from the year prior, up from six to 19.
The assaults included a cab fare who slashed his driver with a knife after asking if the man was a Muslim.
Such once-innocuous inquiries are now delivered with a menacing subtext, says Bhairavi Desai, president of the Taxi Workers Alliance.
"The most subtle change is the tone of that question: 'Where are you  from?'" says Desai, whose membership of 15,000 is about half Muslim.
"It's almost kind of implying, 'Why are you not an American?' There's a questioning of loyalty now in the tone."

A taxi union survey done last year indicated 55% of city cabbies were  told to "go back to your country" or targeted with ethnic slurs in the  previous 12 months.
Nationally, a Pew Research Center poll released last month found 43% of Muslim Americans reported experiencing harassment in the last year.
Aziz's assertion about anti-mosque sentiment was backed by a 35-page  NYCLU report citing nine recent instances statewide - including public  opposition to planned mosques in Sheepshead Bay and Staten Island.
Abed Ayoub, who came to lower Manhattan for the ninth anniversary memorial last September, arrived to find the feud over the Ground Zero mosque in full roar.
The Michigan native said he also found an undefinable tension in the heated air.
"I don't want to say hatred," says Ayoub, legal director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. "But people looking as if I was different. Very upsetting.
"Here I am, born and raised in Detroit - it really caught me off guard."
The head developer of the controversial 51Park Community Center, Sharif El-Gamal, says he never felt singled out because of his religion despite all the vitriol surrounding the project.
"Nobody bothers me at all," he says. "I walk around, and there's never any problem."
Yet many other Muslims are reluctant to speak, fearful of drawing the  attention of law enforcement. They suspect their mosques are bugged,  and their ranks singled out for surveillance.
At a prayer service inside Masjid Hazrat-I-Abu Bakr Islamic Center in Flushing, a month before th 10th anniversary of 9/11, not one worshiper would speak.
The mosque made the headlines when jailed would-be terrorist Najibullah Zazi prayed there during a 2009 New York visit. One of its former imams was revealed as an FBI informant - who also double-crossed the feds by alerting Zazi that he was under surveillance.
Back at 51 Park, Aziz gets ready to start his prayers. He hopes for  the best as the 10th anniversary approaches, although his optimism is  tempered.
"People are not completely friendly like they were before," he says.  "After 9/11, kids going to school were experiencing discrimination from  other students. And from a minority of teachers."
He pauses to consider a question: Whose kids?
"My kids," he replies.

no they feel growing hostility because Islam has a core belief that threatens everyone else's way of life and we do not want that here. Sorry no matter how many liberal minded douchebags you find in big cities America is still made up of a vast majority who do not want multiculturalism  like the few in major cities.

Not one f'in Muzzie can answer the simple question.

Why is it that I can't be against building your Mosque in New York when your predominately muslim countries burn and destroy churches without reprisal and in some countries, they can't even be built.  

And you wonder why people are outraged?  The do as I say not as I do muzzies need to understand that tolerance is a 2 way street but apparently they want to hog both sides of the road. Keep it up.  The steamrollers are just over the hill.

Bigots, lay of the hate sauce and take some lithium. Meet a few of the people you condemn, they really aren't the stereotype you assume. Terrorist radicals are RADICALS for a reason. Don't presume a disposition of majority because of the acts of the minority.

There' s just so much stupidity and ignorance abound these days. I cry everytime I see 9/11 footage and then when I read how much misdirected hostility 80% of you have, combined with most just being too lazy to pick up a book or form an opinion that wasn't force fed to you by the media, I've gotta say that it makes me feel like "well, no wonder we're so hated".
You know what? I hope all life is erased from earth. All the resources, all the potential we've had as a species and this THIS, is what we're all doing with it. Most of you sound so nasty andbitter and pitiful, I wouldn't even want my kids around you. I just hope everyone dies. White people, black people, muslims, jews, christians, the whole lot of us, because all we've turned into is this, just a bunch of entitled goons, thinking that our stupid little opinions are so important because we're all each so special.

katie you are wrong.  It's more then that.  These people insist they want peaceful living.  Yet, that is only if they can convert the USA to a muslim state.  They have our legal system literally giving them rights a regular nonmuslim american is denied.  And don't forget the best proof of a american grown muslim.  He insisted when caught planing to go awol that he was a proud american marine.  Ya, right, that's why the first chance he got that we let our guard down and decided to trust he he went AWOL.  The opening of the war on terror we had muslim soldiers go postal on our young soldiers.  What is the best weapon islam has against us.  The people who swear alligence to our nation then once left on their own they go to islam and share what we tot them.  Ask how many american born muslims are all for one and one for ALL of america none.  Name one muslim who truly cares about the american people and I can prove you wrong.  The people here are here because they don't want to be in their lands until it safe for them.  They may speak english in public and obey laws but once there is a issue they jump to the side of islam.  If given the choice they are muslim first and the USA is a demon.  I can show you a whole mosque full of people who arrogantly toss in our face that they hate our way of life and our feelings.  Every single muslim in that mosque is saying to every single american #$%$ you america and lets celebrate what islam has done here.  And muslim who thinks we shouldn't take offense is a muslim that doesn't support america.  The muslims that do should show their alligence by going elsewhere.  That is the best proof that they are americans and feel for our nation and it's people.  The ones that willingly see the insult and walk away from it.  You know what peeves me the most about this situation.  The muslims be damned attitude towards americans feelings considering the property and it's place in history.  It's a historic sight which means it can't be altered into a mosque.  It has to remain what it was.  An american historic building.  And even better what upsets me is the guy who owns the building made the remark that he "WOULD SELL IT TO THE PERSON WHO WILL GIVE HIM HIS ASKING PRICE FOR THE PROPERTY".  I say put his money where his mouth is.  He gave a figure and upon hearing it Donald Trump told him here's a check for the asking price.  Why are the muslims still defiling the park st address with their religious meetings especially since we found out they can't be trusted to have the best interest of our nation, our city and it's people at heart.  WE have proof imams are helping terror cells and weak minded muslims to go rogue and murder american service members as well as planting bombs.  The own got his asking price sell the property or prove to us we are right to want a fight and the muslim community is insulting the american people.  Sell the property to TRUMP and find another place to call a mosque.  Personally I feel NYC has too many.  And islam is the religion that needs to learn tolerance.  Put the shoe on the other foot or leave our country.  Their braising insistance on defiling Park st is proof they are insulting us.  islam move or go home to middle east were your ignornace is normal.

They should live in fear for the rest of time! They are the anti-Christ. They are hate! They are #$%$ Fuc@k them all. Turn their domain into glass. I am not even the slightest bit religious, but this cult called Islam is the enemy of the world. Do not believe any nice things they say, they want the world. Do not let them into your neighborhoods, they will take over. See how fuc@ed up Europe is with these fuc@ed up people.

With the ground zero victory mosque being constructed and over a hundred mosques in nyc alone I find it hard to believe that "it's just a few extremists."

you're #$%$ right there is a growing resentment against an enemy who has no toleration of differing beliefs.  it is a festering disease that needs to be removed to prevent corrupting society.  what do they have in common with their places of residence other then subversion and subjugation. NEVER....  i refuse to submit to this lunacy.

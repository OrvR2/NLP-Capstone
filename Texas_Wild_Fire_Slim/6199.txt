HSBC (0005.HK) (HSBA.L), Europe's biggest bank, is to cut 3,000 jobs in Hong Kong over the next three years as it targets its first wave of an aggressive cost-cutting plan on five countries.
The bank said on Wednesday the cuts would be made as Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver aims to cut annual costs by $3.5 billion.
That will involve 30,000 job losses by the end of 2013, Gulliver said last month, though he said 15,000 were likely to be added in Asia and other emerging markets.
The first countries to roll out a new streamlined structure will be Hong Kong, the United States, Brazil, Canada and Mexico.
"We will be focusing primarily on our support functions as we restructure to reduce management layers and improve efficiency," HSBC Asia-Pacific Chief Executive Peter Wong said in an email to employees seen by Reuters.
"This does mean jobs will be eliminated ... Our best estimate at this time is that approximately 3,000 existing roles will be reduced over these three years," Wong said.
 That equates to 10 percent of the 30,214 staff in Hong Kong at the end of June.
Major banks have axed or announced plans to cut over 70,000 jobs this year as they attempt to slim down after a slowdown in capital markets and tougher regulations has left many looking bloated.
HSBC cut 5,000 jobs in the first half of this year and will shed another 25,000 by the end of 2013 -- mostly in Europe and North America -- equivalent to a tenth of its 296,000 staff.
Gulliver's restructuring will see HSBC exit or scale back in countries such as Poland, Russia and the United States, where it lacks scale and has been struggling to compete.
He has said the bank's cost base was "unacceptable." He wants to get costs to below 52 percent of income, compared with 57.5 percent in the first half of this year.
HSBC added $3.3 billion of costs in 2009/10, with no extra revenue to show for it. "For all of HSBC's strengths as an organization, and there are many, we can be needlessly complex and bureaucratic. This complexity reduces our effectiveness and efficiency," Wong's email said.
The bank said it would have no more than eight layers between the CEO and customer, compared with 14 layers in some countries at present.

				Josef Ackermann just gave a terrifying speech about the fragility of the Euro banking sector right now.

At a conference in Frankfurt he said, "It is an open secret that numerous European banks would not survive having to revalue sovereign debt held on the banking book at market levels."

"In recent weeks, distrust of the financial markets has spread to the banks because they are now suffering from the debt crisis in Europe and have a lot of exposure to, for example, Greek bonds."

"Since the financial crisis, some European banks have lost a third or more of their market capitaliza­tion,"

"Most institutio­ns have a rating of "below the book value or at best."

The implicatio­n is that not just Eurozone countries are buckling under the pressure of Greece's, France's, and Italy's debts, but banks are too. It sounds like a desperate call for a bailout. Now.
However he says, "State funds could use means to put stability back into many companies and countries, but that does not remain the only solution." 

He says, "Many countries and households would have to reduce their debt. The mortgage business and consumer loans were [the few things] driving growth. In addition, there's the problem of shrinking population­s in several European countries, which negatively affects the growth of credit markets."

"All this reminds one of the autumn of 2008," said Ackermann. "We should resign ourselves to the fact that the 'new normality' is characteri­zed by volatility and uncertaint­y."

				A   day late or  a dollar short you pay a 25% penalty for six monthsThe. Now banks see payday loans as a good deal. After all the back room deals and bail outs, you would think jails would be full of bankers. Don't hlod your breath. The top 2-5% of the laid off people will come out great, golden packages ect. The bottom gets be be treated like they have been treating others. I hope they like it.

Oh, you say the fat cats are still employed?  That's alright squeeze the banks anyway. They don't deserve to be in business. Who needs them when we have Obama to run things? Who needs money anyway?  If our Dear Ruler gets re-elected we'll be paying each other with beads.

				The bank began as itsmyland2 states, in 1865. It's actually HSBC Holdings plc as of 1991 with the head office in London at Canary Wharf (name varies by business and region, see the HSBC site). A number of U.S. businesses were acquired from Household Internatio­nal in a deal that concluded in 2004.  That includes the U.S. mortgage business to which you refer in your post. HSBC is pretty much doing away with most of its businesses in the U.S. with the pending sale of North American credit cards to Capital One and the sale of U.S. bank branches. U.S. mortgage, auto and consumer lending are either demised or basically in run down operations­.

				Sheesh, it's hard to keep track, with all the mergers/ac­quisitions etc.  No wonder these banks can't find the deeds to the homes/mort­gages they buy and sell like bonds.  That's why they're in deep doodoo here; they can't produce the original deed to the homes they are foreclosin­g on.

Shutdown Corner

Green Bay’s Randall Cobb, first NFL player born in 1990s, tears it up in rookie debut By      Doug Farrar



Ready to feel just a bit older than you did before? Check this little factoid out.
Green Bay Packers rookie Randall Cobb(notes), the team's second-round pick out of Kentucky, is the first person born in the 1990s to play in an NFL game. That's right — the 5-foot-10, 191-pound 2011 junior was born on August 22, 1990, just a year before the beginning of the career of New Orleans Saints kicker John Kasay(notes). Kasay was on the wrong side of the Packers' 42-34 season-opening win, and Cobb made all the difference in his first regular season NFL game.
(Yes, we know that Dallas' Tyron Smith(notes) was born in December of 1990, but he hasn't played in a regular-season game yet. )
Back to Cobb. The man who amassed 980 kick return yards and no touchdowns in his entire collegiate career, went off on this breathtaking 108-yard return touchdown halfway through the third quarter:

The play tied the NFL's distance record for a kick return.
And that wasn't all -- Cobb caught a 32-yard touchdown pass from the white-hot Aaron Rodgers(notes) with just 11 seconds left in the first quarter.

All of that in Cobb's first game? If he's any indication of the class that's coming out of his decade soon, we are in for some kind of football.
"It was amazing," he said after the game. "The feeling of being in Lambeau Field and just having all of the guys around me coming off of the Super Bowl and just trying to do anything I can to contribute, and I certainly tried to make the most of my opportunities tonight."
Of course, Cobb is no stranger to the concept of coming up big in big moments — in Kentucky's 37-34 heartbreaking loss to eventual national champs Auburn last October, Cobb caught a touchdown pass, threw for another, and rushed for two more.
If you'd like to read more about Cobb's college exploits, here's his Shutdown 40 scouting report from our 2011 draft coverage archive.

0 users disliked this comment ohio state13  1 hour ago Report Abuse What a weapon to have in an already great arsenal. I caught a couple of his games at Kentucky on TV, and I thought he could be a star, now he's getting the chance to show it. That 108 yard Kickoff return was awesome, and so was his TD catch and run. He's the big play guy the Packers needed, not that they already aren't talented, but just saying.

Not only is he a gifted player he is a stand up individual, never let down his family, team mates or his community. He carried this on to UK when he left east TN and I am sure he will make the Packers family proud. Very good job Cobb !!!! We are proud of you !!!!

Displayed much of the Brady touch with completed passes to
9 different receivers - Which is what Brady still is doing.
Ask Brady - who was his favorite receiver   - He'll
tell you - it's the one who is open - Rogers will Agree!
Now if his O-Line can stay Healthy
This Offence can be Scarry!

1 users disliked this comment Mott-the-hoople  1 hour ago Report Abuse That was an exibition of things to come from Green Bay. Just look at how many people caught the ball last night, 9 receivers were involved in that. Going to be hard to cover that many weapons & TE Finnley. Going to be fun to watch. But keep in mind 1 game does not make a season, keep it up PACK. Oh, and Aaron sure looked rusty didn't he Mr. Silver. Just wait till he gets back into the swing of things.

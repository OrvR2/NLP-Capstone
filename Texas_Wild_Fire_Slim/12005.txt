If you're new to DogTipper, you might want to subscribe to our email updates or our RSS feed! And be sure to bark at us on Twitter and Facebook, too...woof, woof!You’ll remember at BlogPaws we asked many of our fellow bloggers to help us with the “Write a Post, Help a Dog” campaign by Mars Petcare US. For each post, Pedigree was providing food to shelter dogs.
We’ve received word that PEDIGREE® not only met the promised amount of food but increased the donation amount to 27,000 pounds of food in total! The receiving organization is one assisting the region impacted by Hurricane Irene: RescueBank. This national pet food distribution organization is working to get dog food to where it’s needed most in the Albany, New York area.
Thank you so much, fellow bloggers, for posting and for helping us to spread the word about this effort to help shelter dogs. To paraphrase Pedigree’s great slogan, Bloggers Rule!

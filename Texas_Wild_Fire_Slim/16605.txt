		Facebook   ???? to be (on) or not to be.
If the answer is yes, is it better to set up a whole new page or start a group. ?

We have just started with the group thing, but are having second thoughts. It seems a lot easier to grow a page rather than a group.

Any thoughts on the subject would be enlightening, including social media in general.

Thanks all.

Most of us have been touched by age-related disease -- cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's and the like. Watching those around us degenerate is both tragic and ultimately inevitable. And although we cannot fight age itself, we can absolutely give our bodies a fighting chance to thrive into our later years.
What's diet got to do with it you may ask? Quite a lot! According to Rachael Stolzenberg-Solomon, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute, "The easiest and least expensive way to reduce your risk for cancer is just by eating a healthy diet." In fact, researchers say that up to 60 percent of the disease could be prevented if people were to adopt healthier lifestyles (i.e. diet and exercise). I don't know about you, but we think those odds alone are worth the effort it takes to eat healthfully (we love doing it anyhow!). Here are some of the healthiest foods that help to fight off these heartbreaking diseases as we grow into our well-earned golden years.

Wonderfully rich in antioxidant compounds known as anthocyanins -- which have been shown to slow the growth of certain cancers as well as improve brain function, muscle tone and balance -- berries are the quintessential anti-aging food. And, of all the berries, blueberries are the richest in cancer-fighting compounds.

				"The generous doses of calcium found in deep, dark greens like kale and collards, can also retard age-relate­d bone loss."

I totally agree with this.  I actually stopped drinking dairy about 25 years ago (and my frequent lower-abdo­minal pains just disappeare­d!), replacing my morning milk and cereal with fruit smoothies, which eventually became Green Smoothies.  The massive amounts of kale, or spinach, or parsley, or chard... that I put in my daily smoothie must be at least part of the reason that - at my last bone-densi­ty test - was found to have bone density higher than the target level for a 30 year old (when bone-densi­ty typically peaks). 

Interested­?  Read more about green smoothies at:

http://www­.naturally­radiant.in­fo/site/gr­een-smooth­ies-the-br­eakfast-of­-champions­/

Bonus - they've also got berries, almonds, and flaxseed - each of which has its own anti-aging benefits.

				Naturally these are good for you. I don't think people find this as a new story. Its done by everyone, from Yahoo to the NY Times. If anything it is a nice reminder. I do eat all these things on a weekly basis so its like a "yeah, I eat that and know this, cool beans".

Jerry Kill in stable condition after suffering seizure on Minnesota sideline By      Nick Bromberg




The University of Minnesota says that head coach Jerry Kill is in stable condition at a Minneapolis-area hopsital after suffering a seizure on the sideline Saturday afternoon during his team's 28-21 loss to New Mexico State. Team doctor Pat Smith told the Associated Press that Kill "was at no time under any risk in any way."
Kill collapsed during the fourth quarter and immediately received medical treatment on the field. He was treated on the field for approximately 10 minutes in front of a stunned silent stadium before being carted off as the student body chanted his name. (Video is available here. It's brief, but some readers may find it disturbing.)
Kill, who has a history of seizures, suffered a seizure on the field in 2005 while coaching at Southern Illinois. That seizure, in the midst of a series of seizures, indirectly led to the discovery of kidney cancer:
But there was still the issue of the seizures, so Rebecca agreed to have  her husband airlifted to St. Luke's Hospital in St. Louis for  diagnosis.
For three days, Kill was poked, prodded and tested to determine the  cause of the seizures, which is still unknown. But as the family was  packing up to head back to Carbondale, Ill., a two-hour drive, the  neurologist came in with some fateful news.
"He sat down with us, told him [Jerry] what we had to do with the  seizures and stuff, and then he said, 'I also think you need to see your  urologist when you get back home because I think you have cancer. It  looks like you might have kidney cancer."
Kill has never missed a game because of seizures or cancer. While at Northern Illinois last season, Kill, who is in his 18th season as a head coach, was hospitalized for dehydration after a game against North Dakota.
When the game resumed, Minnesota was unable to convert a 4th and 10 with 28 seconds left, dropping the Golden Gophers to 0-2 after losing to USC last weekend.

If you know ANY republican that brags about ANY type of profit they have made "under the table" .... turn them in to the IRS.

Document everything they say ... laugh with them .... dig for details ... write it down .... and send MULTIPLE copies to various field offices as well as the audit dept. in Washington, DC.

1 users disliked this comment William 45 minutes ago Report Abuse I see a lot of posts here about people complaining about other peoples humor and how they poked fun at the coach having a seizure and i would just like to add an observation 
We as a people and as individuals have all at one point in time made a joke in regards to,laughed at in regards to,watched in humor in regards to someone else's affliction,misery,there race,color, creed,nationality,sexual orientation,we see things different as one another.
My point is that what one person finds funny another may not so perhaps we need to be a little more tolerant and respectful of one another

2 users disliked this comment Nelly 5 hours ago Report Abuse its always a scary moment when something like this happens at a game. more so than some hits on the field. you see someone get hit hard and stay down and your like, he'll get up. he's a big boy, i seen him get hit harder before. but when someone just abruptly collapses, you just stand still in awe. its jaw dropping. you seriously don't know what's going on. it's life and death because they usually go unconcious and not many would know what to do but call the ambulance. trainers can only do so much. not all are even qualified for handling a collapse. and can you blame them? its less likely to happen than a car crash. i don't want to make things personal, but it's happened to me due to an enlarged heart. thankfully not during the game. just at practice. the pain just comes and goes. and i will tell you this; being in that situation is terrible. when it became unbearable i just fell and laid there. i didn't want to go to sleep because i was afraid i'd never wake up. it scared others. but i learned something special that day that we all know, but really hinder. life is special. and it's when you feel helpless that you notice it most. as if your outside your body for a second and flash through the past and say 'i could have done so much better'. it sucks that it took that moment, but i feel its better to live life with no regrets than waste time reminiscing on regretful things.

1 users disliked this comment Okami 7 hours ago Report Abuse For all of you that didn't know... our first U.S. President, George Washington, had a daughter named Patsy Custis. She passed away due to an epileptic seizure. ... So think about that little tidbit of American History before you make fun of someone who has/knows someone who has seizures/epilepsy. I have epilepsy, and it's not something to take lightly. It's treatable, but not curable.

Neither J J or Jim can even come close to that. Both of you can leave your parents basement now. Trust me, not one stinking person on the internet will miss either of you.

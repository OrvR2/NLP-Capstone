Michelle Bachmann is right - this is God's﻿ punishment for the moral bankruptcy of the GOP.
As long as rightwingers continue to screw their fellow man, refuse to help people in need, deny the sick healthcare when they can't afford it, and serve their true god - Wall Street & Corporate America, all while cynically saying you're "Christians" who believe in "Jesus" while despising everything he said and did, your world will continue to burn to the ground!

The whole praying to god thing was making fun of him for being a moron. I am sorry you are not bright enough to get the joke. Maybe this is why you cannot find your caps lock button and have to resort to calling﻿ people names. I bet you are not really stupid and that you could change if you tried.

HELL THERES EXTREMELY NICE HOMES FOR RENT IN THE $1,000-$3,000﻿ RANGE WHERE I LIVE AND IM SURE IN AUSTIN THAT WOULD BE VERY SUFFICIANT FOR HIM TO LIVE IN WHILE REPAIRS TO GOVS MANSION ARE BEING DONE!

texas and rick perry do not believe in climate change. But it is now clear that climate change believes in texas and rick perry. Keep praying for rain and forgiveness from god while you are the most polluting state in the country. Keep asking for federal help with your fires after gutting the funding for firefighting in your state. That has all worked so well for you so﻿ far.

These fires must be a﻿ punishment from God since texas is the home of right wing fascism.
Bank of America is "helping" Perry out by firing 30,000 employees

@sdonnell07 There is constructive govt.. and there is destructive govt. IF your﻿ life was at danger youd want as much help as you could get. too.... Also if you wanted to create jobs.. youd wish there would be less regulations by the govt. So there comes a time when you have to be honest with yourself which would require some thinking.

How dare you rick perry to give god an opportunity to prove he's real, he brings you fire instead. Now all joking aside, people﻿ need to stop asking and start doing stuff, this shit is real.

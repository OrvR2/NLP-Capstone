Haiti's quake displaced population makes big dropAP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011





JACMEL, Haiti (AP) — The head of a foreign aid group that's housing Haitians displaced by last year's earthquake says the number of people in the countryside without homes has plunged 90 percent.Luca Dall'Oglio of the International Organization for Migration says that the number of people displaced by the earthquake living outside Port-au-Prince has gone from 300,000 to 30,000.The decline stems from an ability to find land to house people and direct access to local officials.Dall'Oglio spoke Tuesday as he toured a new settlement in the southeastern town of Jacmel, which is popular among some American and European tourists. He was there to hand over 335 new homes to almost 1,500 people.The massive earthquake on Jan. 12, 2010 threw 1.5 million into squalid camps. Now there are about 595,000.

Not as many as was first stated.  I find it hard to see 335 homes for 1500 people reducing 300,000 to 30,000.  Once again report to many, get more money and aid for the pockets of some and then say how much we have done.  But the NUMBERS don't add up.   Glad for those few,  But did those of us who gave get screwed AGAIN.  Help can be wonderful if you can keep the politicos out of it.

I wonder if these figures are like they count unemployment in the United States. Once your unemployment insurance expires your off the statistics. 
This just sounds to pat.

I really hope this is true..I have my doubts however because the last thing I remeber hearig is that they are putting people in old unusable, leaky, shipping containers..Also I cannot believe that B. Clinton who somehow conned his way into being incharge of donated funds would do anything like that without a huge PR campaign!!  Wouldn't YOU like to actually SEE how your donated money is being used?? Or is it just going into Hillarys' presidential campaign fund.?

The decline stems from telling them to get the hell on with there life and get off there ass not an ability to find land to house people and direct access to local officials.

Wildfire benefit at Black's BBQ!





What: Wildfire-Relief Benefit Where: Black's BBQ (Lockhart, TX)When: Wednesday, September 14, 2011, 7-10 PMMore info: Black's BBQ is opening its doors Wednesday night in an effort to help the victims of the wildfires that are devastating parts of Central Texas. Saint Arnold Brewing Co. will be sampling Oktoberfest, and cold Honest Tea beverages will be on hand to wash down the BBQ, while you listen to live music from Austin native and Black's fan John Edward Baumann. 100 PERCENT of all donations taken at the door will be donated directly to aiding wildfire relief. In addition, Black's has generously offered to donate a portion of all BBQ purchased to the relief efforts. So, head to Black's on Wednesday for dinner, cold drinks, and music, knowing that you will play a part in helping the people affected by the Central Texas fires. It's a great cause, so let's all chip in and make it a success! (Check out the event's Facebook page.)

Sorry Jim I didn't realize all you do is attend any and all benefits possible in a 100 mile radius.  We can't all be as altruistic as you.

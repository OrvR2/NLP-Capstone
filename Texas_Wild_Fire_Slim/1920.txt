Mount McKinley climbers to face steeper park feeBy Yereth Rosen | Reuters – 9 hrs ago






ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Climbing Mount McKinley, North America's tallest peak, will be costlier next year under a rule issued on Wednesday by the National Park Service.
Fees for climbers who tackle 20,320-foot Mount McKinley will be $350, up from the current $200, under the rule adopted for Alaska's Denali National Park.
The same fee will apply to nearby Mount Foraker, a 17,400-foot peak that attracts far fewer climbers but is considered more difficult. Climbers 24 years old and younger will have to pay only $250 under the new rule.
The fees fund the park's mountaineering program, which provides ranger patrols, climber-safety education, crowd management during the three-month climbing season and rescues and body recoveries.
A total of 1,203 climbers attempted McKinley this year, and 14 climbed Foraker, the Park Service reported.
Fifty-three percent of those attempting McKinley reached its summit, while only two reached Foraker's summit. Eight climbers died this year in Denali National Park, five of them on McKinley.
Some climbers argued that the increased fee -- and fees in general -- are antithetical to the freedom they seek in the mountains.
Any climber that pays the increased fee to ascend McKinley or Foraker should be branded a "disgrace to the history of mountain climbing," the head of a small Alaska climbing club said on his website this summer, during the period when the Park Service was weighing public comments on the fee increase.
"Those regulations do nothing to actually protect the climbers or the environment. They destroy climbing freedom, and create paperwork excuses for Park rangers to arrest and fine more climbers, to get yet more money for the government," Doug Buchanan of the Fairbanks-based Alaskan Alpine Club said in his essay.
Others said fees and occasional increases were unavoidable.
"It's not a shocker," said Gordon Janow, director of programs for Alpine Ascents International, a Seattle-based guiding company that operates in Denali National Park.
While he would have preferred a smaller increase, "I think most of the people preparing a trip to Denali are going to continue," he said.

the solution is for the climbers to just start selling the viable organs of the climbers that are dead or near death, so they can pay their climbing fees.

Notice the jew lawmakers never make fees on what They do for fun.

Yes, if they don't want to pay a fee that covers the cost of rescue, let them post a bond to cover the entire cost of a rescue, how ever many hundreds of thousands that may be.  Or we let them lie broken and bleeding on the rocks.  Mr. Buchanan wants the mountains to be "free" at the cost of the rest of us that pay the taxes that fund their rescues.

Every citizen in the U.S.A. should have free access to any federal land that is considered a park. If the park is overcrowded, everyone that wants to go, just picks a number. Public land should never be limited to the uber-rich. I pay less for a motel, than for a tent sight in the woods

This is absolutely wrong to put any fee for people who wants to enjoy the nature, while putting their life in danger. The increasing number of states are depending on the lotteries and  gambling. But the immoral elected state represantives have no shame. They should either cut down their wastful programs or increase the rate of income tax, instead of hurting the poor people. No rich person plays lottery or gambles. Only the poor people want to get rich  instantly by gambling when they hear about some people who won the lottery.

MONTREAL - Asbestos victims' relatives want a doctor-turned-Tory MP to hand in her medical licence if she won't take a stand against her party's support for the controversial industry.More than 40 people who have lost loved ones to asbestos-related disease have sent an open letter to rookie Ontario MP Kellie Leitch; The Canadian Press obtained a copy.They say the noted orthopedic surgeon is supporting medical misinformation by backing her government in its endorsement of the asbestos sector.The letter highlights a local news report quoting the MP as saying the Tory government backs the safe, controlled use of asbestos.The note goes farther than a previous one from 250 of Leitch's colleagues, fellow doctors and medical professionals who say she has an ethical and professional duty to place people's health above any other concern.

How soon liberials forget billions stolen from tax payers to be handed out to the party faithful. Billions sent to Shawinagin. Billions wasted on a gun registry. Billions wasted on hospital administrators. Billions stolen from e health. Billions stolen at olg. Canadians would be rich if the liberials would stop stealing from us.

She needs to abandon one or the other. You cannot be an ethical MD, and a Troy MP (no ethics required)..

With her medical specialty being "orthopaedics" then what the hell would she even know about asbestos to begin with. I she were in the building inndustry she'd be against it for sure and to sell it to other countries is criminal. We had asbestos wrapped furnace pipes in our first home and my husband and son both suffered from asthma until we spent a fortune to get them removed and the air cleaned afterwards and Cretien's government refulse to help with any of those cost so don't say the Liberals were against it. They just didn't care either.

She's finished. Utterly finished.

If she bows and accepts her constituents demands, she'll be irking Harper who will make her disappear from the House. If she stands her ground with Harper, then she will be outcasted by the medical community as well as pretty much everyone who agrees that the Asbestos industry should be shut down for good. 

Time to make your choice, Kellie, which path to hated obscurity are you going to choose?

Good for her she backs the safe, controlled use of asbestos as a doctor she would know if it can be used safely, maybe the other doctors are liberals or ndp's ?

I don't get it, it's not even a profitable industry, all our multi-billion dollar per year mining companies are getting bought out by foreign companies and Harper and his less than reputable MPs are intent on saving this one that sells a product which has and continues to kill people and compared to Gold, Nickel, Iron and Copper makes nothing. It's financially and ethically not worth saving and it does nothing but continues to show Canada in a negative light. 
You would hope a Doctor would know better, but evidently selling your soul is a prerequisite of being a Conservative.

Do many of you dear readers realize, or know, P.E.Trudeau & J.Chretien, when anonymous (virtually-unknown)small-time Lawyers;They began to presume in helping Injured Workers, & their survivors, widows, diseased from ASBESTOS, striking against WCB in the late 1950's early 1960's when they were ALL TOLD, their lung-cancers had nothing at all to do with asbestos!
Ending-up not-really helping anyone;Only gaining fame, the two went on to become the Leaders of CANADA!

BTW: "Asbestos insulating" in WTC towers 1 & 2 (the 9/11 towers(not including Bldg. 7)) as in Larry Silverstein, was told, after he acquired the WTC, by purchase only less than 6 months prior to 9/11 2001;Silverstein was quoted 1 billion dollars $$$ "COST- PLUS" to remove the asbestos!!! Well, another alternative was used, in order to bring about the tyranny we are ALL now under!

9/11 WAS AN INSIDE JOB! God's karma is coming into full force, pray, to free us once again! THe asbestos-issue, being the beginning of Liberals, may signal the downfall of the Conservatives!!

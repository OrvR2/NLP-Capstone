Progress made by firefighters on the wildfires in Leon and Grimes counties has enabled officials there to shut down temporary command posts. 
Grimes County Sheriff Don Sowell said most of the Riley Road fire that has been burning in Grimes, Waller and Montgomery counties has moved mostly south now, and no evacuations are in place for residents of Grimes County. 
The Texas Forest Service has not determined a cause for that wildfire, but it is under investigation, said Carmen Apple, a spokeswoman for the College Station-based agency. 
Apple said the fire is about 75 percent contained, has burned 60 homes and 18,946 acres -- making it the third-largest ongoing fire in the state behind the Bear Creek and Bastrop Complex fires. 
In Leon County, County Judge Byron Ryder said fire breaks are holding, but firefighters were busy most of Monday battling flare-ups.
"The problem is that there's so much unburned land within the break," he said. "It'll be completely out, and then five minutes later, there's another fire."
He said officials are working night and day to monitor the fire breaks and look out for flare-ups. 
"Nothing in the state is going to be safe until we get some rain," he said. "Every day will be a challenge and problem until then."
Ryder said of the more than 30 homes lost in his county, only two belonged to full-time residents and the rest were vacation or weekend homes. 
"These volunteers have just done a phenomenal job," he said. "If you see one on the street, stop and shake their hands. They deserve the appreciation."

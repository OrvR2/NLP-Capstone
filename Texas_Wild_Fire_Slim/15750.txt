Celebrity sauces - Are they worth their A-list prices? 
By ConsumerReports.orgAmerica's fascination with celebrities goes beyond their exploits on the stage, screen, or field, leading more and more stars to cash in with products that bear their names. But are those offerings buzzworthy? Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

The products we tested typically cost two to three times as much as garden-variety brands. Because celebrity products are pricier, they can afford to include better ingredients, such as balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, fresh herbs and vegetables, and San Marzano plum tomatoes from Italy. 
Many celebrity products include such ingredients, but others don't. In Mario Batali's $8 bottle of marinara ($1.33 per half-cup), he uses San Marzano tomatoes; fresh, not dehydrated, carrots, garlic, Italian parsley, onions, and thyme; extra-virgin olive oil; and sea salt. By contrast, Emeril's (about $4) and Newman's Own (less than $3) list tomato purée (water and tomato paste) as the first ingredient, as does Ragu. Emeril's doesn't specify whether its onions are fresh, but the label notes the garlic is powdered. The garlic and onions in Newman's Own are dried.

 Francis Coppola Pomodoro-Basilico 
                    An Oscar-winning writer, director, producer, and California winemaker, Coppola also sells a line of organic pastas and sauces named after his mother, who wanted her grandchildren to call her Mammarella (Little Mama) instead of Grandma.

Price $6.75 (24 oz.)                    
The scoop: Big garlicky and herb flavors. But an off-note to the garlic detracted from the overall quality.

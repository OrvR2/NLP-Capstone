 Media News






TV Guide has released its annual list of television's biggest salaries. Though the list covers all areas of TV, there are quite a few media personalities in the mix.
Among the top were Katie Couric's $15 million contract with CBS, which drew some whistles at the network, and Larry King's $14 million gig hosting "Larry King Live." Couric's tenure as anchor of the CBS' evening news program ended in June, while King retired last December. 

Unsurprisingly, their replacements are not earning nearly as much. But there's one man who stands above both of them: NBC's Matt Lauer, who is pulling in an eye-watering $17 million a year for the "Today" show. 
Below, see how much media personalities are making. Let us know which salaries you think are well-deserved -- and which you think are just excessive!

				Piers is a welcome addition. I was always afraid King would "throw a seven" as my father used to say. He rambled on and was ingratiati­ng to guests. Enough. Good luck, Piers.

				It is amazing that network news anchors get millions for what amounts to no more than reading from a teleprompt­er.  Since that seems to be the only skill needed, Obama can become the world's first trillionai­re when he leaves office in January 2013, if he can get hired by one of the major networks.  Of course that would be a change of roles.  He would end up working for the media when the media now works for him.  Moreover, if he gets hired, that would be the first time ever he actually had a hand in creating a job.

				Keith Olbermann at $10 Million?  So in determinin­g his salary, they multiplied the projected viewership of his show, on a network 99% of Americans have never heard of, by about 1 million and then put a dollar sign in front of the figure.

				I'm assuming the ad revenue generated by their respective shows and each presenter'­s perceived importance to attracting viewers (ads) determines their value, which suggests they are worth it. Considerin­g how successful & lucrative Today is for NBC it makes sense that Lauer is the top earner, he's the bedrock of that show. I'm guessing Olbermann'­s fee isn't just for presenting­, isn't he news director or something?

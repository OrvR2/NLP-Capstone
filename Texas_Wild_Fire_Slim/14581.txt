BASTROP, Texas (AP) — Firefighting crews started Wednesday to gain control of a wind-fueled blaze that has raged unchecked across parched Central Texas for days, leaving a trail of charred properties in its wake and causing thousands of people to flee.At least two people have died in the wildfire, which has destroyed more than 600 homes and blackened about 45 square miles in and around Bastrop, a city near Austin, the state capital.Texas Task Force 1, an elite search team that was sent to New York following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, will be assisting in Bastrop.The team has dogs that can help look for people trapped in debris, Chief Bob McKee told The Associated Press. "We also have human remains canines that would scent on deceased persons or animals," McKee said.Crews finally got a reprieve Tuesday from winds pushed in by Tropical Storm Lee that whipped the blaze into an inferno over the weekend. Texas Forest Service spokeswoman April Saginor said the Bastrop fire was 30 percent contained early Wednesday, and that the lighter winds were assisting firefighters in their efforts."Even though the fuels are critically dry, the grass is dry and the relative humidity is still pretty low, they were able to take advantage of lower winds," Saginor said.The blaze in Bastrop is the most catastrophic of the more than 180 fires that have erupted in the past week across Texas, marking one of the most devastating wildfire outbreaks in state history. The fires have destroyed more than 1,000 homes, caused four deaths and pulled the state's firefighting ranks to the limit.Texas Gov. Rick Perry cut short a presidential campaign trip to South Carolina to deal with the crisis, and on Tuesday toured a blackened area near Bastrop."Pretty powerful visuals of individuals who lost everything," Perry said after the tour. "The magnitude of these losses are pretty stunning."White House spokesman Jay Carney said the Obama administration has approved seven federal grants to help Texas with the latest wildfires.About 1,200 firefighters battled the blazes, including crews from as far away as California and Oregon. Five heavy tanker planes, some from the federal government, and three aircraft capable of scooping 1,500 gallons (5,600 liters) of lake water at a time also helped.The disaster is blamed largely on Texas' yearlong drought, one of the most severe dry spells the state has ever seen. The fire in Bastrop County is the most devastating wildfire in Texas in more than a decade, eclipsing a blaze that destroyed 168 homes in North Texas in April.At least 11 other fires exceeded 1,000 acres (400 hectares) Tuesday, including a 7,000-acre (2,800-hectare) blaze that has destroyed at least 60 homes and threatened hundreds more about 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest of Houston. An 8,000-acre fire has destroyed at least six homes in Caldwell County, next to Bastrop County. In far northeast Texas' Cass County, a 7,000-acre (2,800-hectare) fire burned in heavy timberland.___Michael Graczyk reported from Houston.

I can't believe so many people have so much hate in their hearts.
To wish people in their own country would burn just because you they do not like someone
running for President. . Wonder if they are truly Americans. If Texas is so bad why are so many people wanting to go there. Talk like this is whats wrong with America now.
Wonder if any of you have ever really worked in your life or set around thinking otheres owe you a good living. Those people who have money have worked their tail off to earn it.
You could have something too if you had been working all these years insted of complaining.

Hopefully the volunteer fire fighters can get this horrible fire put out.  God bless them for what they are doing.
I hope all the families were able to leave their homes before the fires got to them.
Bad enough they will have to deal with the loss of all
their personal things that can't be replaced.

To all of you whining Texans....

This natural event would have been quickly extinguished in the past... back before the people of Texas voted in a party lock stock and barrell that promised to cut such unneccessary expenses like fighting fires. THEY (you) made it political.

So buck up and go put your own fire out like a bunch of swaggering a-holes (excuse me - rugged individualists) would do and quit asking the rest of the country to pay for something you CHOSE to not pay for yourself.

Two years ago Perry cut the fire fighters budget 75%. Most fire fighters are volunteers and have to buy their own equipment. Yeah this what we want Perry to do to all of America. Even now Perry won;t help his own, and is thankful for neighborly assistance. What a way to run a State, as if it is a third world nation.

Obama is a Disgrace to this county!!! I am glad that I had an IQ enough to know, that you do not vote some one who has never ran a political office much less a business!! Facts have proven me right so far, look at our countries credit rating. At-least Bush didn't make that go down and destroy what our forefathers fought so hard for!!!

You know, if you do not have a clue about Texas on a factual basis, then you are pretty lame and on the shallow part to make negative comments about Texas! Who died and made anyone who judges God, There is only ONE GOD and i am really sure it not those who think they know it all about Texas! You have good in Area and in Any State!!!

I've had friends lose their homes to this fire and its absolutely disgusting to see some people on this page act so immature about this awful situation. Jesus Christ grow up, when Irene hit I didn't see a lot of people going "Oh, who cares...they're a bunch of liberals...good riddance." But I guess since you're on the computer you can talk like a complete ass. That's cute. This isn't about Perry or what you vote for, it's about helping people going through absolute hell.

To all the "tough guys" and "smart guys" talking smack about Texas and "no federal funding for Texas" because Perry wants to secede Texas anyhow, blah, blah, blah...Keep it up.  Maybe we will.  When we do, we'll take all the BILLIONS generated by our oil companies based here, like Exxonmobil, NOV, Shlumberger, Halliburton, Transocean, Cameron, BP, Noble, Ensco, Technip, Apache, Aramco, Shell,...shall I go on??  Just for good measure, we also own the gulf ports, upriver shipping routes through Texas and our railways from the ports where A LOT of your goods and service products come from (if they are coming from South America or Europe).  Then, we'll upcharge you a premium for our beef, pork and poultry.  Let's not forget, most of Oklahoma wants to come with us if we were to secede, because "they cling to their guns and religion", too, geniuses.  So before you talk all this trash, you had better think about what you're really asking for.

Shame on some of you people! Who cares if it's a red or blue state?! God forbid you or your family have to endure the losses these people are faced with. At the end of the day, North or South, blue or red, black or white...we are human beings....start acting like it!

I just got a $829.99 iPad2 for only $103.37 and my mom got a $1499.99 HDTV for only $251.92, they are both coming with USPS tomorrow. I would be an idiot to ever pay full retail prices at places like Walmart or Bestbuy. I sold a 37" HDTV to my boss for $600 that I only paid $78.24 for. I use BidsOut.comONLY

Texas should stop accepting help from the Nanny state. Take some personal responsibility and put those fires out as individuals as red state Americans should.

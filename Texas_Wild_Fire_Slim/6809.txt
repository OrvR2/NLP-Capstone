    I ordered a one year subscription and the next thing I know I getting spam from the Daily News in my email account. They are sending me their so called "Deal of the Day". The opt out takes 3 days to process. Nobody ever asked if I waned to receive spam  They just started sending it. I wonder how many places they sold my email address to. Stay away!

    I like being able to read the paper in the same layout as the printed version and the subscription prices are very reasonable. I think the only thing I'd want is an automatic download every morning.

White House To Texas: Go To Hell



Posted by
Tom Mannis


Friday, September 09, 2011





September 9, 2011 - Texas - Texas is  battling its worst wildfires ever. More than 1,400 homes have been destroyed. The White House, however, seems to be ignoring a request to declare a major Texas a disaster area.Is President Obama deliberately ignoring Texas's desperate plea for help? According to CNN today,  "Texas needs an immediate disaster declaration from President Barack Obama allowing access to heavy equipment and other assistance to help battle wildfires burning across the state, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said."  (See his video press conference from Sept. 8 below.)CNN further reports that Dewhurst says that the White House has not responded to a previous request for assistance. When the White House was asked about this, says CNN, "There was no immediate response."Dewhurst is the Acting Governor of Texas this week while Gov. Perry is on the campaign trail. Perry is running for the Republican presidential nomination and could be real contender against Obama in 2012.That previous request was made by Dewhurst on Wednesday, September 7. He issued the following statement after requesting a federal Major Disaster Declaration for the State of Texas:"I've been working very closely with Governor Perry and our emergency personnel, and we're doing everything we can – using all of the state resources at our disposal to contain these wildfires, ensure public safety and protect Texans' lives and property. Because so many fires are burning across the state, our resources are spread pretty thin. That's why we need the federal government to step up to the plate immediately. We need to cut through the red tape and get Texas the help we need today. There are federal resources – including aircraft, bulldozers and other heavy equipment – that can and should be made available right away."One has to wonder if this is a way for Obama to shove a thumb in the eye of Texas Gov. Rick Perry. While all economic recovery efforts of the Obama Regime have failed so far, Perry has overseen a state in which one third of all new jobs in the U.S. have been created in the past year. In other words, the success of Texas highlights the failed policies of Obama's Washington. This may account for the lack of a response from the White House.

The SOBs at the White House are refusing to distance themselves from the remarks by Jimmy Hoffa, Jr., the top Bastard of the International Bastardhood of Teamster Bastards.Watch a video here, in which ABC News reporter Jake Tapper tries to get a straight answer from Barack Obastard's press secretary, little son of a bitch Jay Carney.The Washington Times has a great piece about Carney's non-sensical, hypocritical response to Tapper's good questioning.The double standards in the White House is stunning.Hat tip to Pat Dollard.

Video: Jimmy Hoffa Jr. Declares Class Warfare Against Tea Party "Sons of Bitches"



Posted by

Monday, September 05, 2011





September 5, 2011 - Detroit -Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa, Jr. called Tea Party people "son of a bitches" in a Detroit rally today. He made the remark as he stirred up the crowd prior to Barack Obama's Labor Day speech. "President Obama," he said, "this is your army. We are ready to march. Let's take these son of a bitches out and give America back to an America where we belong," Hoffa added. (Watch the video below.)UPDATE 9/6/2011: Bastard Obama Won't Apologize For Bastard Hoffa's Offensive Labor Day SpeechPerhaps Hoffa doesn't understand that, with his words today, he has effectively  declared war on many Teamsters rank and file members. Those are the ones whose paychecks are regarded as open cookie jars by union leaders, and not just the Teamsters.A call for violence: As I've written before, I am hearing calls for violence on the streets of Madison, Wisconsin. Several self-described "progressive liberals," who did not know they were speaking to a Tea Party conservative, told me that union leaders in Milwaukee have said privately that "violence would be justified" in their fight against Gov. Scott Walker. Other folks have said that they themselves would be "okay with violence" in "the struggle for collective bargaining rights." Liberals have been violent on a massive scale in the past. Why should we believe that they would not be so again? The folks I have spoken with are itching to rumble.One must wonder about the hints of violence in Hoffa's remarks today. When he said "Let's take these son of a bitches out," did some lunatic take that the wrong way? After all, in the wake of the Giffords shooting earlier this year, Democrats went balistic (no pun intended) over "vitriolic rhetoric" of conservatives. They rushed to link such "vitriol" to a motivation for the attack on Giffords. So, today, we hear the leader of the Teamsters offer his union members up as conscripts in Obama's "army," for the purpose of "taking out" the opposition."Alright, alright, Jimmy Hoffa Jr. was not calling for blood in the streets," wrote John Romano at the Yes But Whatever! blog, " but his rhetoric will surely be worrisome to many.  It hasn’t been a year since Gabrielle Giffords was shot and the media attacked Sarah Palin for using a target graphic in a campaign ad for Congressional candidates her PAC backed in 2010.  Where is the new era of civility that the Democrats called for?"  Good question. Where is the civility, Mr. Hoffa? You can bet that no Democrats, and certainly not Comrade Obama, will call Hoffa's words "vitriolic." In fact, Obama let it slide."Naturally," wrote Warner Todd Huston today, "the Constitutional Professor in Chief said nothing about Hoffa’s disgusting display. But that shouldn’t be surprising. Obama himself has been known to employ all manner of violent tinged campaign rhetoric. He likely saw nothing wrong with Hoffa’s words nor those of the race-baiters in Congress from earlier."In fact, after Hoffa made his vitriolic speech, Obama told the crowd that he was proud of Hoffa. Civility, anyone?Hoffa's words are a tinny echo of a call to "get a little bloody" made by Rep. Michael Capuano (D-MA) in February, 2011. "I'm proud to be here with people who understand that it's more than just sending an email to get you going," he said. "Every once and awhile you need to get out on the streets and get a little bloody when necessary." (Watch a video here, and see a couple of videos about union violence below.)So here's to the Little Guys, the unions members who are abused by their own union leaders for the sake of enriching themselves and bastards like Hoffa. More and more union members are fed up with those corrupt union leaders, and it should be no surprise to anyone that union membership is down.Nationally, less than 7% of private sector employees are union members. While unions were beneficial and necessary in the past to help fight workplace abuse, the tables have turned. Long gone are the days of sweat shops, and we have a five-day work week. Thanks are owed to unions of the past for those advances. Today, however, it is the unions themselves that are the abusers.RELATED:Hoffa Threatens GOP: "Take These Son Of Bitches Out" - Real Clear PoliticsJimmy Hoffa Declares War on Non-Union America - Yes But HoweverUnion membership goes down in Wisconsin - Stevens Point JournalJohn F.

Ralf Seiffe, R.I.P.

Friday, September 02, 2011





September 2, 2011 - Chicago - John Tillman has written a nice memorial post in honor of Ralf Seiffe, a great patriot who died unexpectedly on Sept. 1.I, too, am saddened by the fact that I will never get to know this man as well as I would have liked to. He was a sharp and upbeat guy that I'd had the pleasure to meet and interact with on numerous occasions over the past four years. I'll always remember him from meetings at the Lincoln restaurant in Chicago or at Tea Party meetings downtown. He was always smiling.Here is an excerpt from Tillman's post:"The liberty movement lost a great friend when Ralf Seiffe died unexpectedly yesterday morning. Ralf was truly one of life’s unique characters that come along all too rarely. Ralf was a joyful lover of life, people, history, culture and, of course, liberty. Ralf was a fountain of creativity. He always had a breadth and depth of knowledge on his many brainstorms, but what was so amazing to me was that he always knew more pertinent and interesting information about my crazy ideas than I did. Not only that, he could add value to the idea of the guy on the bar stool sitting next to us on a Friday afternoon at Hackneys...." Read the rest of this at the Illinois Policy Institute Blog...

Watch the entire track of Hurricane Irene in this video from NASA. This is one of the most amazing hurricane images I've seen. NASA describes it as "an animation of satellite observations from August 21 through August 29 showing the birth of Hurricane Irene in the Caribbean and her track over Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas, the U.S. East Coast and into Canada." UFO Shock added some nice music underneath the video. Watch it there, or see it here:

Monday, August 29, 2011





August 29, 2011 - The Australian newspaper reports that Barack Obama's uncle Onyango is being held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as an illegal immigrant. (See related video below.)Onyango Obama, 67, was drunk as hell and driving an SUV when he almost hit a police car last Wednesday night, August 24, in Framingham, Massachusetts.The photo of Onyango Obama, left, is a mugshot taken by the Framingham Police Department.The Australian notes that Onyango Obama "was detained as an illegal immigrant because the US Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement has an outstanding warrant for him because he was previously ordered to be deported to Kenya."Official records say that Obama was "picked up outside The Chicken Bone Saloon in Framingham, Massachusetts, at 7:10 pm on August 24" because, police charge, "he nearly crashed his Mitsubishi 4x4 into a patrol car."MetroWest Daily News reported on August 26 that a "man illegally in the country from Kenya was drunk when he nearly ran his sport utility vehicle into a police car Wednesday night on Waverly Street, police said. After the near crash, Onyango Obama, 67, told Officer Val Krishtal that Krishtal should have yielded to his Mitsubishi SUV, according to a report filed yesterday in Framingham District Court."  The report also notes that "Obama failed a Breathalyzer test, registering .14. The state legal limit is .08." (For you Obama sycophants, a breathalyzer is also known as an "inhalator.")Human Events reports that "Uncle Omar" tried to use his connection to the White House to get out of the DUI trouble.

How To Avoid Expensive Cell Phone Contracts



Posted by
Tom Mannis


Saturday, August 20, 2011





This post brought to you by Straight Talk.  All opinions are 100% mine.I hate getting bills, especially in the current economic climate.  Sure, you can cut some things out of your life, like that subscription to Post-Apocalyptic Knitting Magazine. But some things you just can’t live without, like reliable cell phone service.  If you’re sick of being locked into a long contract with your current service, listen up: It’s time to consider moving on.  	You could save big by switching to Straight Talk.  Saving money is good, very good, and it’s even better when you can do it without sacrificing quality.  Why not cut your phone bill in half?  Think of how much richer you’ll feel. Better yet, think of how much richer you’ll actually be. Imagine how much more enjoyable it will be to call a friend when you're not upset about your phone service. For that matter, even calling your mother for advice will be fun because you won't have to ask her for money. And her advice is usually pretty good, you know. After all, your mom knows best.     	Seriously, why bind yourself into contract for expensive cell phone service when you can get everything you need without one?  I don’t mean to insult anybody, but knowing that there is a better option and not looking into it is, well, just not smart. If you’re paying more for your current service than you should be, you should consider Straight Talk. It’s a less expensive, no-contract alternative that has everything you need.    Switching over to Straight Talk is hassle free and easy. No contracts. No surprise bills. No credit checks. Straight Talk has great coverage all over the U.S., with great reception and connectivity.

The “Unlimited Monthly” service is only $45, and includes calls, text, picture messaging, and web.  Imagine unlimited calls, text, picture messaging and web for a whole year, for only $499.00!   Need information? No problem! 411 calls are included at no additional cost. There are NO fees for activation, reactivation, or termination.     	Straight Talk International Long Distance Service is a flexible prepaid calling service that enables you to make international calls from your home, cell or office phone at low rates.     	Remember, Straight Talk has great phones to choose from with great prices. Save even bigger with reconditioned phones, available from only $10.00 with camera, mp3 player, mobile web access, and blue-tooth capability. Don’t forget their fantastic smart phones; touch screen phones, and app capable phones with features like voice navigation, camera, video recorder, music player, instant messaging, and Bluetooth®.

Will I Go Homeless - Again?!? (Updated)

Tom Mannis


Wednesday, August 17, 2011






From my other blog, Homeless Patriot: I'm in a desperate race against time to find another room. You see, I've been lucky to have had a room for the past few weeks here in Madison. After sleeping in a shelter and on the streets, I was able to get a space in a fraternity house just off of the U.W. campus.

Frat houses take boarders in the summer. Summer leases begin just after school lets out in the spring, of course, but I did not arrive until mid-July.... I'll keep looking, but time is very short now. It's just past noon on Wednesday, August17. If I don't have a place by noon this coming Saturday.... Full post at Homeless Patriot...  Update: Yes, I am again homeless. The one-month lease that I had expired at Noon on Saturday, August 20. Here's what I did that night...

Powerful Video Highlights Obama's Failures



Posted by
Tom Mannis


Monday, August 15, 2011






This video, "Obama's Debt-End Bus Tour," is sure to tug at your heart strings. Well, okay, at your wallet chain. It's a production of the Republican National Committee (RNC), but that doesn't make the facts presented any less true.

Obama is touring the Midwest "on a new $1.1 million bus purchased by the Secret Service, an impenetrable-looking conveyance the size of a cross-country Greyhound, painted all in black, with dark tinted windows and flashing red and blue lights." (CBS News)  Isn't it nice to know that in these tough economic times, President Obama is not wasting taxpayer money on things like expensive new buses for his own personal campaign? Isn't it?

Talk about bad timing. On the Friday before President Obama's widely-anticipated jobs speech, news came of the economy adding no jobs -- yes, zero -- in August.
If possible, Obama's upcoming speech may now be even more closely watched than before, as millions of unemployed Americans wait for a plan to lead the nation out of the jobs hole. Among those ideas rumored to be on the table are middle-class tax cuts, projects to boost infrastructure and placing particular emphasis on providing relief for the long-term unemployed. Will Friday's dismal news could compel Obama to  go bigger?
To prepare for the speech, we asked HuffPost readers to give us their best ideas on how to get Americans back to work. Below are just some of the various suggestions provided from all parts of the political spectrum. And based on the results, while jobs are currently scarce, American ingenuity is alive and well.
Here are some job-creation suggestions by HuffPost readers (Disclaimer: Some adult language):

				None of these ideas are going tomhave a great effect on unemployme­nt.  As long as corporate America gets tax or other considerat­ions while making their products out of the country, their is no insentive to make these products in the USA.  Profit for the shareholde­rs supersedes all else.

(3) End Free-trade agreements with all but first-worl­d nations.  Exporting good paying jobs to third-worl­d nations does not improve our GDP.
(4) Suspend the payroll tax for one year if an employer hires a long-term unemployed person for two years and pays them above a certain amount.

				That would NOT solve anything, especially since CONGRESS is the PROBLEM, not the President.

Impeachmen­t would WASTE at least half a year with the US tied up in a political knot and in the end Obama would still be President because there are not enough votes in the Senate to convict him.

Sure the House could "impeach" him but all that is in reality is an indictment with no action.

Only the Senate can convict and the republican­s do not have the votes.

				Foreign Direct Investment­.  American companies have the money and the means to hire...but no personal incentive.­..So how about a bit of competitio­n?  
We should invite and encourage foreign industries to come here, build and hire Americans.­..That would at least increase job oppurtunit­ies...and maybe light a fire under American industry as well. Foreign firms will also have an incentive to succeed by their investment here. That's what "Globaliza­tion" is all about....

				The problem we face is one of the mind. Many of the population is limited to simple ways of life just because others believe it is their fate. For example, the debt of a country has no meaning unless there is a desire to continue to outsource jobs using the same old business methods. But if you don't care about the debt, the currency would depreciate and jobs would return by local manufactur­ing demand. Therefore, I recommend a team of psychologi­sts, to analyze each and every act by congress, the senate and the president to keep them mentally honest.

				No payroll tax for the employers, but for the worker. Yes, I actually worked for a small company where the owner had the payroll company take out all deductions as per the law, but then HE NEVER PAID THE TAXES TO THE GOVERNMENT­. HAHAHA They came in there so fast, they locked up and removed all filing cabinets and computers. But he was back in business about a year later.

				One solution like another comment below is Buy US goods only but also reduce your purchasing­. Live with in your means. This will financiall­y stabilize you and everyone doing business around you. If you can't pay off your cc's then settle them out.. take the credit hit and get yourself back on stable ground. You don't need credit as much as you think. If you already have a home financed and can afford the payments, your car payments are reasonable­.. even if your upside down, if you can keep the payments going on the necessitie­s, you are find, get rid of all the other payments. You will be able to afford to buy again soon and you will stimulate the economy. Its the credit cards holding us back with that min monthly payment. fyi

				Why?

Businesses ONLY hire people for one reason - they have more demand for their products or services than the current workforce can handle with overtime.

The problem is there is NOT ENOUGH DEMAND, so companies can meet all the demand with their existing US workers and any more non-US workers they need to hire temporaril­y.

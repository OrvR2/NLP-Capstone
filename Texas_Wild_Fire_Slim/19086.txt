Subaru recalls 2010-2011 Legacy, Outback for windshield wiper issue

Japanese automaker Subaru has issued a recall for Model Year 2010-2011 Outback and Legacy vehicles manufactured from January 7, 2010, through May 20, 2011. Subaru says faulty components inside the wiper motor's bottom cover could overheat.

According to Subaru, if the motor's bottom cover overheats, the windshield wipers may no longer function, which could lead to reduced visibility and increase the chance of a crash.

Subaru will notify owners of the 195,080 affected Outback and Legacy vehicles by the end of November. As is typically the case, dealers will replace defective components free of charge and owners are urged to contact Subaru for more info.

Tata CEO Forster steps down after only 18 months

Tata Motors has announced that its group chief executive officer, Carl-Peter Forster, resigned with immediate effect, only 18 months after joining the company.

Tata, India's leading maker of trucks and buses, and owner of Jaguar and Land Rover, says Forster resigned due to "unavoidable personal circumstances," but will remain a non-executive member of Tata Motors' board. Forster stated:


I deeply regret that my personal circumstances make it difficult for me to continue to perform the challenging duties of managing the thriving global activities of the Tata Motors Group with its main activities in India and the UK and increasingly in additional overseas markets.

Forster's departure comes as Tata Motors continues its lengthy search for a successor to Ratan Tata, who is set to retire soon as chairman of the sprawling conglomerate. Forster joined Tata in February 2010 after leaving Opel, with his focus on turning around the then-struggling Jaguar-Land Rover division. Tata Motors is currently seeking Forster's replacement.

How powerful is the Hennessey Venom GT? Just you watch

It's easy to talk endlessly about unbelievably powerful cars, almost to the point that numbers become meaningless. In an effort to crystallize what 1,200 horses in a 2,685-pound car can do in the real world, we present a new video of the 2012 Hennessey Venom GT.

In the time it takes your wheezy Civic to go from 65 to 75 mph, the Venom GT has sprinted from 70 mph to a staggering 215 and is on its cool-down run. If you were to push hard enough with enough road, Hennessey says the Venom GT wouldn't stop until it hit 275 mph. Click past the jump to see the what the instrument cluster in the Venom looks like when you drop the hammer at 70 mph.

BAC Mono single-seat road car is "fan-bleeding-tastic"

Autocar's ex-racer scribe Steve Sutcliffe sat himself in the middle of the BAC Mono – which is the only place to sit, actually – and came away with a helmet full of glee. The £79,950 single-seater apparently drives just like an F3 car, an effect created in part by its 1,190-pound weight, 280-horsepower, four-cylinder Cosworth engine and its F3 suspension. Sutcliffe said it handles better than a Lotus Elise, which one might expect of a race car for the road, but that it also drives better, too.

Briggs Automotive Company is making 35 Monos this year, but they're all spoken for. Next year's run of 50 is also sold out. So while you wait for 2013 and a bunch of money to afford it, there's the video after the jump to keep you entertained. Another video you'll find there: Bjork's "All is Full of Love," which was said to have influenced the BAC Mono's design. That's what we call cool.

Mercedes-Benz offers new Ride Control suspension on SLS AMG

The flagship Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG represents the pinnacle of the company's considerable engineering prowess. Yet there are always those looking for a little more. And for such customers, Mercedes has announced a series of new options available on the Gullwing coupe and its roadster counterpart.

The list includes new wheels and paint finishes (like the Sepang Brown Metallic pictured above), as well as the company's latest blind-spot warning system. But the salient point of the announcement (which you can read in full after the jump) is the new AMG Ride Control suspension.

Available as a ~$3,000 option over the stock setup, the new adjustable suspension offers drivers a choice between Comfort, Sport or Sport Plus settings. Some buyers will invariably revel in the choices, but then as Lotus founder Colin Chapman once famously quipped, "Make the suspension adjustable and they will adjust it wrong." Good thing, then, AMG has taken the guesswork out of the equation.

Red Bull and Renault renew partnership for five more years

Of all the automakers that have supplied engines to Formula One teams over the years, few have seen Renault's level of success. But while the French automaker scored world championships with its own team in 2005 and 2006, the bulk of its achievements have historically come as supplier to independent teams.

This season Renault is powering three teams, and will power Williams once again starting next season. But without a doubt its most successful partnership has been with Red Bull Racing. The team is the current reigning champion in both the drivers' and constructors' categories, and looks poised to repeat this year. Little surprise, then, that the two outfits have opted to renew their partnership for five more seasons.

The newly announced agreement will see Red Bull running the current V8 engines and KERS hybrid system for the next two seasons, during which it will collaborate directly with Renault Sport on the development of the new 1.6-liter turbo V6 units for use starting in 2014. With Red Bull and Renault stepping up to such "premium technical cooperation", we can't help but wonder if the French manufacturer is looking to further decrease its direct involvement with its own works team and elevate Red Bull – long rumored to switch its engines to Infiniti branding – to its principal collaborator. Official announcement after the jump.

Volkswagen ad shop Deutsch has prepped the first round of videos to promote the new Beetle, and there's a whole lotta shakin' high-fivin' goin' on. Set to Shirley Ellis' "The Clapping Song," the first spot shows the driver of a 2012 Bug needs to be on call for hand jiving. You'll find three of the new commercials after the jump, as well as the original "Black Betty" Super Bowl spot that's been tweaked to reveal the coupe at the end.

2011 Italian Grand Prix put the pedal to the metal [spoilers]

Over the last five years, four different drivers have won the Italian Grand Prix. All of them were on the grid for this year's race. In fact, if you go back for ten, the only Monza winner who isn't still in F1 is Juan Pablo Montoya, long since departed for the heavier machines and banked ovals of NASCAR. There's just something about the track just outside of Milan that puts champions in their groove and beckons them back again, year after year.

So, who would win this year? Would Michael Schumacher notch up his sixth win at Monza? Would Rubens Barrichello overcome all the odds to win his fourth? Would Alonso or Vettel rack up their third? Or would we see a new winner altogether? Follow the jump to find out.

Mercedes-Benz's heavy hitters to unveil new C-Class DTM in Frankfurt

Mercedes-Benz fields no shortage of F1 drivers in the DTM touring car series these days. In fact, up-and-coming F1 star Paul di Resta earned his stripes driving Silver Stars in the series. But while the likes of David Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher can be found in the Mercedes paddock at tin-top events around Germany and across Europe, it will be the latter's older brother Michael taking the spotlight once again, together with his junior teammate Nico Rosberg, when the company unveils its latest DTM challenger at the Frankfurt Motor Show this week.

While the current C-Class DTM racer was based on the sedan, the new vehicle is based on the new C-Class Coupe. Or at least in appearance, anyway, as the underpinnings are likely to largely carry over from the existing machine. The announcement follows the previews given by BMW and Audi back in July of their new challengers, the A5 coupe replacing the previous A4-based machine and the M3 joining the paddock for the first time in decades.

We don't have long to wait now until we see the new C-Class DTM coupe up close and personal on the floor of the Frankfurt Messe, but for those who just can't wait, we've got a preview clip with 2005 DTM champion (and perennial McLaren test driver) Gary Paffet for your viewing pleasure after the jump.

Flyin' Miata at Targa Newfoundland, Part 2: Technical difficulties

While Keith and Janel Tanner took Friday to hash out setting the odometer on the V8 Roadster Miata, Brandon Fitch and I continued on with our education with the Open Road Motorsports Targa School in our trusty Supercharged NC. The day's instruction orbited around two simulated stages on Bell Island just a short ferry ride from St. John's. With our notes prepped, our own Terratrip rally computer properly calibrated, and a closed course through the winding roads of the island ahead of us, we were understandably enthusiastic about putting our freshly-gleaned skills to use.

We arrived early, took the first spot in the queue just ahead of a vicious-sounding Ferrari Enzo and waited for the stage lights to go green. When the time came, Fitch dropped the hammer and I immediately began rattling off instructions.

Group seeks national registry for historic cars

The Historic Vehicle Association wants to change the fact that there are national historic registries for places, boats, planes, and trains, but nothing to protect vehicles with historic value. The Association, started in 2009 by Hagerty Insurance, a company that specializes in coverage for classic vehicles, is championing the passage of laws that further protect historically significant vehicles and allow them to stay on the road.

Determining which vehicles are significant and assigning a degree to that significance is one of the head-scratchers the Association is up against right now. "We're looking at how things are treated, everything from a Marmon Meteor to a milk truck," says Carmel Roberts, Association Director of Government Relations. There are design, ownership and origin factors that determine a vehicle's place in history, and the association is open to upgrading vehicles so they can continue to be used, the same way historic homes can be outfitted with modern plumbing and wiring.

It's unclear whether the effort and expense to pass laws protecting older cars will have any effect on their preservation. Cash for Clunkers didn't apply to 1957 Chevrolet Bel Airs or 1973 Lamborghini Espadas, for example, and legislation doesn't change the expensive reality of just storing a car properly, let alone restoration.

Ford Transit Connect CNG taxis swing into action across U.S.

The next time you hail a cab in Southern California, you could be jumping into a vehicle fueled by clean-burning compressed natural gas (CNG). That's because California Yellow Cab of Orange County has become the state's first taxi company to put CNG-fueled Ford Transit Connect vans into service. California Yellow Cab says 10 (and soon more than 120) natural gas Connects are on the roads and ready to pick up passengers in the greater Los Angeles area.

Meanwhile, over in Chicago, Taxi Medallion Management says it has a dozen Ford Transit Connect CNG taxis in service. And in Connecticut, two cab companies are waiting for Ford to fulfill orders for 70 CNG-fueled Transit Connect taxis.

Later on, CNG-fueled Transits will ship out to Las Vegas and St. Louis. Philadelphia is expected to get in on the CNG action, too, once city officials approve natural gas vehicles for taxi duty.

  With the flurry of hype surrounding the launch of Spotify in the U.S., it was just a matter of time before the streaming music provider partnered with an automaker. And today is that day. Well... Sort of.   The Spotify crew is working with the SYNC API at today's TechCrunch Disrupt Hack-a-Thon to integrate with the AppLink system. It's not an official partnership, but it is the first step in bringing the service into the car.

Aha Radio lets you stream everything from news feeds to podcasts to your smartphone and, depending on your infotainment system, your car. Today, Harman – the company behind Aha Radio – has announced a partnership with Slacker to deliver on-demand music, sports, comedy and news stations through the app.

Slacker is essentially SiriusXM light, with over 150 stations playing an assortment of programing. The system can deliver several million tracks through the enhanced iPhone app when it goes online later this year, and several automakers are looking to integrate the system into their vehicles in 2012. Full details in the press release after the jump.

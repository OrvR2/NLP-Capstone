The most proactive diabetes book, August 16, 1999


        By A Customer


Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)


This review is from: The Diabetes Cure: A Natural Plan that Can Slow, Stop, Even Cure Type 2 Diabetes (Hardcover)


I am a person with Type II diabetes that had been able to treate the disease with diet. My blood sugars were starting to get out of the acceptable range when I got this book. I followed the recomendations listed  in the book and my blood sugars are all back to normal now. I have also  lost weight with the system. All I can say is that it works for me. I have  never felt better in years.This may be the best book for people with Yype  II diabetes.

Practical book about a very common disease, March 22, 1999


        By A Customer


This review is from: The Diabetes Cure: A Natural Plan that Can Slow, Stop, Even Cure Type 2 Diabetes (Hardcover)


Kudos for writing a book that empahsizes exercise, nutrition, as well as some of the nutritionnal supplements that may help control this devastating disease.  There are other supplements that also demonstrate promise.  I  have applied the principles in this book and used products with HCA, as  well as other supplements, with very good success.  It is refreshing to see  that physicians are finally realizing that there are better ways to handle  diabetics than merely flogging a diabetic who is insulin resistant with  oral meds and more insulin.As a family physician who has been involved  in academic medicine for 12 years, I salute you.

Cut My Insulin Use By 33 Percent!! So far. . ., August 19, 2005


By Ronald D. Carrington "RDC" (Idaho, USA)  - See all my reviews

  





This review is from: The Diabetes Cure: A Natural Plan That Can Slow, Stop, Even Cure Type 2 Diabetes (Paperback)


IF YOU GET ANY BOOK FOR DIABETES, GET THIS ONE!!!
I have had Type 2 Diabetes for over twenty-five years, I take 
five Prescription Drugs, two types of Insulin to "Control" my
Diabetes. I have started the 9 Steps (five I have been doing 
already) for a month and a half now. I have had measurable 
results!! So far my Insulin use has dropped by 33 percent! Yes,
for the same amount of carb/time intake, what I use to have to
take 15 units for I now only use 10! I have always had a real
problem with my triglycerides, (this made by blood like pudding)
after starting the use of the hydroxycitric acid and chromium 
from the book my triglycerides have dropped from a danagerous 798
to 333 so far. This again is a measurable number. All I can say 
is SO FAR this book and information has been G R E A T ! ! !

British superstar singer Adele gave by far the most moving, gorgeous performance at last Sunday Video Music Awards, wowing audiences worldwide. Her pre-performance routine remained private, however, and that's probably for the best: there's a good chance she was getting sick right before she sang.
The Grammy-winning singer covers the upcoming October issue of British Vogue, in which she talks about, amongst other things, her pre-show nerves, body image and show business.
Renown for putting on one of the most moving live shows in the music business today, Adele has had to cancel tour dates over the past year or so due to various illnesses, including losing her voice. But even when she is fit and ready to perform, she doesn't always feel so well in the run-up.
"I puke quite a lot before going on stage," she tells the magazine (via Just Jared). Though never actually on stage. But then, I s*it myself before everything ... the bigger the freak-out, the more I enjoy the show!"
It's a happier spin on what she told Rolling Stone this summer in her big cover story interview.
"I'm scared of audiences," she said. "One show in Amsterdam I was so nervous I escaped out the fire exit. I've thrown up a couple of times. Once in Brussels I projectile vomited on someone. I just gotta bear it. But I don't like touring. I have anxiety attacks a lot."
Adele also discusses her weight, which she has been outspoken in defending as mindless critics focus on her body and not her music. Luckily, she doesn't seem to care much what other people think; she's happy the way she is.
 "I've seen people where it rules their lives, who want to be thinner or have bigger boobs, and how it wears them down," she tells the magazine. "And I don't want that in my life. I have insecurities, of course, but I don't hang out with anyone who points them out to me."
Once again, it's a similar sentiment to the one she expressed in her Rolling Stone cover article.
"My life is full of drama and I won't have time to worry about something as petty as what I look like," she told the magazine. "I don't like going to the gym. I like eating fine foods and drinking nice wine. Even if I had a really good figure, I don't think I'd get my tits and ass out for no one."
Her approach is certainly working; Adele is atop the shortlist for the Mercury Prize, Britain's top prize for original music, being handed out Tuesday night.

				Adele is an incredible talent.  My favorite songs are "Hometown Glory" from 19, and "Someone Like You" from 21.  This latter song rumbles through me and shifts my tectonic plates each time because of the singer's luxurious vulnerabil­ity: admitting emotions still for the love of her life who has slipped from her fingers and is now marrying another girl.  I tend to think it's hard to remain poised in the face of humiliatio­n and loss.  And yet that's what this song ultimately is about.

In addition, I applaud her for not hanging out with people who'd wish to exploit her insecuriti­es.  It is her right to choose whatever geometric shape she wishes to inhabit.  

Lastly, I know so-called skinny people who make fun of every fat person we might drive by, saying things like, "They're not going to live very long," even while tugging on their cigarettes­.  The irony of their characteri­stically two-pronge­d comments has never failed to crack me up.

				Adele's voice has brought me to tears--it'­s so beautiful and pure. She's my daugter's (and one of my) favorite artists. I'm so thankful that girls of this generation have a real woman with a real voice to look up to from within the music community. The pickins' were pretty slim in the '80s for girls with ambitions in music. Even the enormously talented Wilson sisters were forced to "doll up" in order to sell records.

				Adele....

Being a former performer being "nervous" is a good sign. Best performanc­es are given
when you are under these conditions­. 
I use to worry when I DIDN'T feel the pressure. 
Your music and how you present it will always be the winner.
Congratula­tions with your great talent and success.

It's her life, no matter how much I'd like to see her live, if all she wants is to put out music, and not tour live, more power to her.

				"Adele gave by far the most moving, gorgeous performanc­e at last Sunday Video Music Awards" I know it is subjective­, so state it as an opinion, not as if there was a worldwide poll taken. That performanc­e was the most boring of all. Even Jessie J in her foot casted sidekick role was more moving and entertaini­ng to boot. Who writes this stuff and when will people who have to learn how to follow a tune and keep up with a rhythm stop being critics?

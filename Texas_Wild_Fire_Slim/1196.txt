On Monday night, the University of Maryland played a college football game before a raucous, rain-soaked home crowd. They won this game. But all of the touchdowns and co-ed enthusiasm seemed of little consequence compared to what the Maryland players were wearing. 
The Terps uniforms, which were intended to look like Maryland's state flag, generated a Twitter maelstrom from fans and athletes alike ( the best of which can be viewed here).  With so many people rushing to dub these the worst-looking outfits in the history of uniforms, we couldn't help but wonder what are the ugliest uniforms in college football? 
Many feel the University of Maryland's uniforms shot them to the top (or bottom?) of the list of 120 division I-A football schools. But to their credit they may have given the Terps a distinct advantage that ultimately led to their 32-24 victory over the Hurricanes last night. After all, whenever the Maryland offensive players moved at high speeds in those jerseys, there was simply no way for Miami defenders to know whether they were tackling an opposing player, a referee or a misplaced courtier of the Queen of Hearts from Alice In Wonderland. In fact, the refrain of "off with their helmets" resounding across social media platforms could possibly have convinced Hurricanes players of the latter scenario.
Here is an unfashionable show that includes some of the bad, the banned and the downright ugliest jerseys in college football.
Feel like we missed a school or are upset that your school made the cut? State your case in the comment section.

And of course there's the belle of the ball: The University of Maryland.

These uniforms set off quite a reaction in the twitter world, mostly negative, but we think David Nelson of the Buffalo Bills had the best insight when he tweeted, "Seeing a lot of talk about Maryland's jerseys on here.. I think Under Armour got what they wanted."

				Did one of the unpaid interns from HuffPost's style pages sneak into the sports pages while no one was looking, to try to emulate Tim Gunn?

If so, you didn't Make It Work.

Kudos to Maryland and everyone else for coming up with some distinctiv­e uniforms.

				Glad Maryland won the game but my eyes are still burning from their helmets.Th­ese college teams should stick to one home uniform and one road uniform.Ma­ybe a special home uniform once a year.But what Oregon and Maryland are doing with a different uni each game is ridiculous­.Teams need an identity and that's what their uniforms should be.

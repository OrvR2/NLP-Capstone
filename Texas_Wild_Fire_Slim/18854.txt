Delahaye USA Bugnotti Coupe



Without argument, Delahaye is responsible for some of the world’s most beautiful automobiles. Despite being founded in 1894, it wasn’t until the mid-1930s when they branched out from building engines and trucks to build their first in-house car. 1935 brought the highly successful Coupé des Alpes and a foray into racing. After a number of successful models, the company struggled during the Nazi occupation of France and the high taxes on French luxury cars that remained after World War II. Delahaye was taken over by Hotchkiss in 1954, who shut down car production and dropped the Delahaye label.
Today, Delahaye USA of Long Valley, NJ is hand building such vehicles as the new Bugnotti Coupe (pictured above). Producing aluminum and carbon fiber bodies atop modern chassies, equipped with V12s and pulling design inspiration from the likes of Delahaye, Delage, Duesenberg, Bugatti, Talbot Lago and Rolls Royce. The new Bugnotti Coupe is scheduled to make its full-size public debut at this year’s Pebble Beach Retro Auto in Monterey, CA,August 13-15. Continue for more photos and visit Delahaye USA for more details and pricing.
Simply Gorgeous.

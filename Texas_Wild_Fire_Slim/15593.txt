Video shot September 5, 2011 on the north edge of Bastrop State Park near Austin. All but about 100 acres of the 6,000-acre park have been blackened by fire. Firefighters have been battling blazes for 3 days. At this point, historic CCC buildings are still intact. For more information, see http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/

@allstarmd23 Hi I'm a Firefigther for Magnolia, TX. I'm explaining how it we work. Notice that there are no structures to protect, therefor the fire does not need to be stopped BECAUSE, if you extinguish the fire before all the fuel is burnt then it has a high risk of just starting again, so they let everything burn, to let it run out of fuel, it would be different﻿ if there was a house, we would protect it and let the fire burn around it. I hope this helps you and everyonelse reading

This is not sped up time lapse. It is real time. And I was standing﻿ across the highway so as not to burn up. (look for a video by Earl Nottingham, you can see me standing by the highway) The spot on the lens is ash. I'm not a firefighter, I'm a photographer for TPWD. I document things relating to parks & wildlife. The news folks handle the homes and people. 1500+ homes have burned as well as most of Bastrop State Park. Fire & water can be dangerous so be careful. Awe inspiring. DC

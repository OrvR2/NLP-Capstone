A call to volunteering after 9/11 


Tweet














					
					Associated Press




  
NASHVILLE — She was just a girl when she heard it on TV — the notion of "people
getting together" to do something relevant and helpful after the
traumatic events of Sept. 11, 2001. And Alee Pagnotti listened. Now, 10
years later, the law student is still living that notion — and trying to
recapture the feeling of giving that followed those dark days.
At
dawn Sunday, she joined hundreds in a northern Nashville neighborhood
to build seven new homes for families — a dividend in brick and mortar
of the towers that fell hundreds of miles away and a decade in the past.
"This is a good reminder to keep that spirit alive," Pagnotti said.
Across
the nation, Americans built homes, shined fire trucks, cleaned parks
and, again, gave blood on the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11, trying to
recapture the good-will, can-do spirit that people say they lost in the
decade since the attacks.
About
200 Habitat for Humanity volunteers stood in the front yard of one of
the little, pastel-colored homes; volunteer. Jason Johnson sang "God
Bless America" on a front porch, an American flag hanging from the
rafter. The neighborhood was filled with the sounds of hammers,
generators and saws as the volunteers worked.
The
National Day of Service and Remembrance was launched in 2002 by family
members of Sept. 11 victims. With projects in all 50 states, the goal
was to honor the victims and turn the tragic anniversary into something
positive. President Obama spent time with his family working at a soup
kitchen in Washington on Saturday, encouraging Americans to find ways to
serve.
Americans
renovated community centers, cleaned public parks and again, gave
blood. In Richmond, Va., folks shined fire trucks. Hundreds of pints of
blood were donated in Brooklyn, Mich., people donated hundreds of pints
of blood. In New York City, volunteers gave kids school supplies and
free haircuts. Volunteers in Raleigh, N.C., painted city playhouses.
More
than 800 volunteers lined up in Boston to put together care packages
for U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and other places around
the world, filling cardboard boxes with socks, hand sanitizer, chewing
gum and personal messages.
"It's
a nice outlet on a day like today," said Helen Herzer, a coordinator at
a Boston historic society. "It's a gesture of community service as well
as doing something nice for a soldier who isn't enjoying a beautiful
day in the United States like we are today."
David
Paine, president and cofounder of My Good Deed, a nonprofit promoting
the day of service, estimated that 33 million Americans planned to
observe the anniversary by volunteering or doing some form of charity.
In
the days and weeks after the 2001 terror attack, Americans who didn't
live in the places directly affected — New York, Washington, D.C. or
Shanksville, Pa. — felt impotent. Folks wanted to help. They stood in
line for hours to give blood, although there were few 9/11 victims to
give it to, and described feeling united with fellow Americans.
"As
unfortunate as it was, it seemed like it put us all back into the frame
of mind that life wasn't just about me," said Yvette Windham, a
44-year-old volunteer from Nashville. "This is the least that we could
do."
Sam
Sommers, a professor of social psychology at Tufts University, said it
was easy for Americans to come together after 9/11. Less than a year
before, the country seemed fractured by the contentious 2000
presidential election. But after 9/11, he said, it was easy to come
together in a crisis. Years of war, economic crisis and pessimism hasn't
inspired the same feelings, he said.
"We're
facing threats at home right now, different kinds of threats, economic,
threats have done the opposite, that haven't unified us," he said.
But Friday night at a New York City firehouse benefit, singer Jon Bon Jovi was nostalgic for a different spirit.
"I want the country of Sept. 12 again, when everybody came together," he said.
One
of the seven homes being built on Sunday, went to Edwin Lewis, who
paused from helping with some dove-grey vinyl siding to remember where
he was 10 years ago: watching the burning World Trade Center on
television. He thought it was a movie.
He noticed the unity immediately after, but also noticed how it lagged in the ensuing years.
Now,
Lewis is hopeful, both for his and his country's future. He never
thought he would own his own home, and he's just a few weeks away from
moving in.
"My
mother once told me that America is the land of opportunity, and I
believe this home proves that," he said. "For people to come out here
when they could be at church of watching football, that says a lot.
"I hope we see more of it."

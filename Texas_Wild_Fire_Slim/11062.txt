On October 7, 2010, award-winning storyteller Jay O'Callahan presented a captivating story about NASA entitled Forged in the Stars: A NASA Story, at the NASA Headquarters Auditorium. Compellingly told through the viewpoints of three main characters and a wonderful supporting cast—all portrayed by O'Callahan—his performance of a "love letter" to NASA has been received with a sense of joy, awe, and wonderment by NASA employees young and old. APPEL is delighted to be able to share this story with you.Commissioned by the NASA Academy of Program/Project & Engineering Leadership to help commemorate NASA's fiftieth anniversary, O'Callahan immersed himself in interviews and Center visits and emerged with a fictional story that captures the heart of NASA and its unending passion for exploration and discovery.Related Resources: Read the story "To NASA, with Love" : http://1.usa.gov/bagUt0

One thumbs up is just not enough for this. I've been fortunate enough to twice see Jay perform this story, have listened to his CD too many times to count, and it still gives me shivers and makes me laugh out loud. He not only got a standing ovation at the National Storytelling Festival, he captured my mother's attention, who never really got what storytelling was all about﻿ until she listened to the CD. Thank you, NASA, for putting up a full version. Hope it leads to more gigs for Jay.

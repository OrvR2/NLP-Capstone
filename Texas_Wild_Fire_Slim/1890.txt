Football Game Sign Ignites Racial Tension, Police Hunt For Apple’s Missing iPhone 5 Prototype, and a One Ton Crocodile CapturedBy Adriana DiazPostsEmailBy Adriana Diaz | Trending Now – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

A sign at an Ohio high school football game has some outraged over what they say is racism but others are saying the sign refers to Internet slang. After Kirtland High School beat rival Painesville Harvey, Kirtland fans unveiled a large sign that read, "You Mad, Bro?" The president of the Lake County, Ohio, chapter of the NAACP called the sign "racial intimidation." The Painesville, Ohio, superintendent agreed. He said, "The sign definitely has a racial connection to it." However, the term is also a common saying on the Internet. If someone gets angry online in a forum or comments section, "u mad bro?" is often used as another way to say the person got the best of them.  Whether the sign was in fact racist or just Internet slang, the principal of Kirtland High said there will be a thorough investigation. What's your take on the sign? Tell us on Facebook and Twitter.
The saga of Apple's lost iPhone 5 prototype continues. The technology site CNET.com reported that an unreleased iPhone 5 prototype (likely veiled in an iPhone 4 case) was left at a San Francisco tequila bar in July. Apple investigators then contacted San Francisco police, telling them the device was priceless and that they were desperate to have it back. Using GPS, Apple tracked the device to a San Francisco home. Police and Apple investigators went there and spoke to a 22-year-old Sergio Calderón. Calderón told the San Francisco Weekly that the group of four men and two women said they were part of the San Francisco Police Department, even though it was revealed later that some members of the group were Apple employees. In the state of California, pretending to be a police officer is a crime punishable by up to a year in prison. Calderón told the investigators that he had in fact been at the same tequila bar where the phone was lost but had no knowledge of a lost phone. Calderón let the group search his home, car, and computer, but it came up empty-handed. The investigators told Calderón that the phone's owner did not want to press charges and would pay $300 to have the phone back. Calderón said one of the officers even threatened his family's immigration status, even though they are all U.S. citizens. "One of the officers is like, 'Is everyone in this house an American citizen?' They said we were all going to get into trouble," Calderón told the San Francisco Weekly. If you're wondering why you might be feeling déjà vu, it's because last year an Apple employee lost an iPhone 4 prototype at another San Francisco bar. The men who found it sold it to the technology site Gizmodo for $5,000, leaking the phone's secret features to the press and creating a PR disaster for Apple.
Lastly, a photo going viral across the Web shows a one-ton crocodile that was captured in the Philippines. The croc was hunted down after locals suspected it of killing a local fisherman. After destroying four traps in three weeks, the 2,300-pound reptile was finally captured. It took about 100 villagers to help drag the heavy creature onshore. It's now slated to be the newest star at an ecotourism park the local town plans to build. On Twitter, one person called the beast their "worst nightmare" and another wrote, "Cue the Jurassic Park theme music! RT @CNN: 21-foot monster crocodile caught."

As you can see from my picture, I am a person of color, and I have to be honest. Does this sign offend me, truthfully......No. I wish we could, get to the point where we call all of eachother, Brothers(bro) and Sisters(sis) and mean it. As far as the sign, is it racist NO...(not in my opinion)..... is it lame......YEAH(in my opinion). but that doesn't exclude, that there are some people out there that would use a sign like this, with a racist intent. Just not sure that this is one of those times.

Someone please, please explain why anytime some black person doesn't like something, it's racial. My best friend of 32 years is more my brother than a friend and I call him bro'. Why is it black people can call each other brother and sister, but if a white man calls him bro' he's a racist ? Maybe the naacp should call out obozo and mrs obozo, both of whom are admitted racists. think about that one sharpton.

I don't recall this kind of uproar when the story was released where that guy in the courtroom repeatedly said, "Don't taze me, bro!" Is that because the video showed that the officer was a white guy? Does everything now have to be so PC that we assume it's racism if we don't know otherwise? Ridiculous.

Due to the decision by the Oakland School Board to denote and recognize the primary language of African American children attending school Ebonics or African American Vernacular English became legitimized.  
Therefore, a white person speaking Ebonics is no different than them speaking Russian, Chinese, Spanish etc.  Black people made it a legitimate language; they have no right to now say who is privy or not to speak it.  I would take this to the Supreme Court with my law firm.

One of the most pressing problems in today's society is the overwhelming number of "News" organizations. There are far to many. Look at all the talking heads on T.V. and it's enough to make your head explode. Stick to what really matters in the world and stop searching for stories to justify your existence There are far fewer crimes than 30 years ago but you would think the worlds going to explode tomorrow if you listen to all the media outlets. Give yourself a break and take a walk and skip the "News" for a week.You'll feel so much better.

It the NCAAP had it's way every word in the dictionary would have to pass 'racism' inspection  before it could be uttered.  They already have concluded that fried chicken, watermelon and nappy are racist.  Of course, they're only racist if white people say them.

Wasn't it one of their founding goals to eliminate the double standard?

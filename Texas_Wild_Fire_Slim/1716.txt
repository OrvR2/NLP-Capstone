WASHINGTON --The president's reported $300 billion plan to resuscitate a stagnant job market remains in a fairly vague form, one day before the president is set to discuss it in an address to a joint session of Congress. But sources outside of the administration are hopeful about one component: money that would be spent to rehire or retrain teachers and repair failing school systems. 
Several Democratic sources on and off Capitol Hill told The Huffington Post on Tuesday night that the president would discuss those funds in his speech. How much he will focus on them remains unclear, and there is general concern that the amount of money he will propose allotting won't meet the need. The White House has steadfastly refused to comment on the president's plan for jobs, save to stress that it will be paid for in full and include objectives that both Republicans and Democrats can agree to. 
Details began to emerge on Tuesday evening when the Associated Press reported that Obama would call for "public work projects, such as school construction," while the Los Angeles Times reported that the speech would push for "job training for the unemployed and a program to prevent teacher layoffs.”
Advocates for these programs insist that they resemble a case of smart politics and even smarter policy merging. For parents recently dropping their kids off for their first days of school, a call to lower class size and repair facilities will be alluring. And it's not as if the need for these changes isn't there. 
State and local governments, facing budget shortfalls, have turned to school systems to make up the difference. Only three states increased funding for education in FY 2012 -- the rest cut it by millions. California, in a particularly alarming example, laid off an estimated 19,000 teachers as of this spring because of a $27 billion budget shortfall. Sending money to states of municipalities for the direct purposes of teacher retention or rehiring will curtail that trend, put teachers to work and generate a solid amount of economic activity, advocates say.
The refurbishing of schools could have an even larger economic multiplier effect. Currently there is an estimated $270 billion to $500 billion backlog in school maintenance and repair projects nationwide. A droplet of federal spending would be consumed quickly, putting construction workers to work in a needy sector.
Sources familiar with White House deliberations have said that advisers to the administration are weighing the merits of the Fix America's Schools Today (FAST) program, which would fund the maintenance and repair of public schools. The distinction between school construction and repair is an important one. The former would involve enhanced federal assistance and longer-term investment. Repair would have lower capital costs and less of a federal imprint. Both are needed. But political advisers see repair as a far easier sell for a Republican-controlled House of Representatives. 
Who will get the money and how much will be spent also matters. Jared Bernstein, the former chief economist to the vice president and a supporter of FAST, told The Huffington Post that, theoretically, money could be sent to either the hundred most needy school districts or even the hundred largest.
"It's a smart infrastructure program that is fast-acting and labor intensive," he said, adding that "It fits the criteria" of a good bang for the buck.
Advocates for FAST have called for approximately $50 billion in upfront spending, with the hope that early investment would beget future ones as neighboring school districts petition their members of Congress for money of their own. The Associated Press, however, reported that the "White House proposal is expected to be smaller" than that figure. 
UPDATE: 12:05 p.m. -- The Huffington Post's Joy Resmovits reports that U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said he is "very, very confident that ... education will be prominent" in Obama's jobs speech.
"It's something he fundamentally believes in," Duncan said, though he would not specify exactly what the administration had in store in terms of policy proposals or funding requests.
Speaking to reporters on his back-to-school bus tour, the education secretary did argue that "tens of billions of dollars" are necessary for the repair of school buildings. "There's tremendous need in rural, suburban areas," Duncan said. "When times are tough, folks defer capital expenses."
Duncan did offer a hard number for how much money might be needed in state or federal aid in order to reverse the tide of teacher layoffs across the country.
"It's a big number," he said.  "A couple hundred thousands of teachers have lost their jobs."

                        We talk about education reform decade after decade, yet the end-result never seems to be anything which benefits the child. The failing school systems cannot be saved where the only remedy offered is one designed to coddle and protect the failed teachers and their unions. "Children First" may exist on a few political signs, but it has always been "Unions First" and democrats have an

				Ok Im going to be brutal here, The left says we need more money for education, ok, Carter gave us the U.S. Dept of education, how many millions of our tax dollars have been dumped into education since then, and here we are asking for more, usually when you fail at a job they replace you, but, it's also important to note here, What the Government pays for  it gets. So if we have falling tests scores and a poor educationa­l system, look no farther than The U.S. Dept of Education. Im just saying...y­a can't blame the Repubs for what the Demo's create

				Putting money into retaining teachers would be a great idea.  It invests in our future, leading to a more educated workforce when those kids grow up, while also bolstering consumer demand now (since employed teachers will be buying more things than laid-off ones).  That's one of the best things the government can be doing right now.

Building MORE schools isn't probably necessary in most areas, but refurbishi­ng or repairing the current ones certainly is.  The investment in the future isn't as apparent, but it'll also boost the economy, since the workers that get those jobs will, also, spend the money they receive.

Of course, given Obama's history, he'll probably propose something ALMOST like that... like building new charter schools and hiring laid-off teachers for severely reduced pay while a few political appointees get fat paychecks, thereby doing less good for the economy.  And he'll probably be stymied by Republican­s in Congress that demand the money be spent in tax cuts for "job creators" instead of on actually creating jobs.

				The President may as well go for something big enough to bring everybody out of the Jobless hole we find ourselves in to day, but I am afraid that no matter what this President suggest it will be come null and void for these newbie's in Congress and the No, no, no Congress of last year.  Together they will not give this President any thing that he proposes.  There is very little if anything that this Congress will not do to defeat this President and his Administra­tion.  I Beg you to take a look at whose running for Obama's job and listen very closely to the Tea Party talking machine signing things stating that they will not raise taxes.  Take a good look to see what kind of a president each one would make a good president then  think about how the Tea Parties almost pushed this country off a cliff and thought that they had gotten the better deal from raising the debt ceiling.  Think about Medicare and Social Security then think of Medicaid this list goes on an on look at whats happening in WI IN FL OH is this where we want out Country to be these next four years.  If so vote for the Tea Parties if not Obama our President give him another chance to put this Country back on track.  Most of all give him someone to work with in Congress.

Unfortunat­ely, He has had Congress working with him the first two years of his Presidency­, and He has gotten almost all of His agenda passed, Healthcare­, Bank bailouts, Auto-indus­try bailouts,s­timulus package not at all the total list of His" achievemen­ts" in the words of Rachel Maddow " There is territory the White House has said it would like to cover that it has not yet covered. By my estimation it is halftime, right, in the first term and with this vote tomorrow they will have gone 85% of the distance they said they wanted to go in the first term of the president.­” Thats impressive­, yet here we are, and the left after all this still blame Bush and the Republican­s? I do believe this is Obamas economy now. "no no no Congress of last year" have you even been paying attention?

				I love this..http://www­.foxnews.c­om/politic­s/2011/09/­07/republi­cans-opt-n­ot-to-give­-rebuttal-­to-obama-s­peech-tick­ing-off-pe­losi/#ixzz­1XHDgScKLI guess some have rightfully concluded that there is no need to take more away from the football game that follows the address.However, in fairness, I DO agree that ALL of the elected officials in Washington­, DC should ATTEND. Those saying they won't, like DeMint (and I LIKE DeMint) come across as petty in their assertions­. It's fair to point that out..

				Education isn't up to the feds, it is a state by state situation, where states compete for citizens. With the correct income tax climate, state education and smaller government­, citizens can exercise their right to work and be happy.
Just as a side note do you know where the majority of the jobs were created?? TEXAS ya TEXAS.
Go figure, no state income tax, excellent education system, small state government­.
This is the opposite of Obama policies that haven't worked yet. Now have they??
Anyone better off?? That's right no one is better off, no one.

				I am better off! - disproving your statement.  Lets evaluate, Texas' education system is not good - 38th in the counrty in funding per pupil (2009) , and 15th in Math proficienc­y for 8th graders, 31st in Reading proficienc­y for 8th graders, and 35th in science for 8th graders (all in 2007).  Not "excellent­" at all and we both know that to be true.  Texas is just slightly behind Mississipp­i in jobs.  The Texas jobs related more to oil than most other states' jobs.  Also, note for the record, Texas added minimum wage jobs that while better than nothing are not what is needed except by McDonalds, Burger King,Wal-M­art, K-Mart, et al (I like and use these companies but the wges they pay are essentiall­y subsidized by the federal Earned Income Tax Credit because they will place a family of four below the poverty guideline of $22,400..  Again better than nothing but just barely.  Lets get it right before we try the FOX news approach.

The GOP's first Romney-Perry showdown debate: 4 predictionsThe Week – Wed, Sep 7, 2011





Americans will get their first glimpse of a Mitt Romney-Rick Perry grudge match in a critical presidential debate Wednesday nightRepublican candidates have been campaigning for the party's 2012 presidential nomination for months now, facing off in debates, straw polls, and fundraising races. Well, "ignore all that," says Ken Rudin at NPR. "The battle for the GOP nomination starts in earnest" on Wednesday night, in the debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. The "ever-magic Reagan name" isn't the only reason this debate will stand out from the "endless series of Republican clashes," says Jonathan Bernstein in The Washington Post. It's also the first debate to include the new GOP frontrunner, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, and marks the first time in the race that Perry and former frontrunner Mitt Romney will share the stage. What will happen? Here, four predictions:
 1. Rick Perry will be tested This isn't just Perry's introduction to a national audience, says Ken Walsh at U.S. News. It's also his first presidential debate. And, as the new frontrunner, "Perry will be the top target" during what promises to be the season's harshest debate yet. Perry showing up at all is "an unusual spectacle," says Molly Ball at Politico. He's only debated four times in his decade as governor of Texas, and while he's not a great debater, he "rarely makes a mistake and almost always manages to win by not losing." All the recent stories questioning his smarts have actually helped Perry by "lowering expectations," says Marc Thiessen in The Washington Post. To win, he just has to "put in a credible performance" and come off as "serious, likable, and viable."
 2. Nobody will "pull a Pawlenty" Reagan's famous 11th Commandment — "thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican" — will be thrown out the window Wednesday night, says Mike Harris in the Ventura County Star. That's especially true for Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.), who's fighting for her political life after Perry's ascension diminished her from viable nominee to second-tier wannabe, says David Corn at Mother Jones. Bachmann has been slapping at Perry from afar, and the worst thing she could do is duck a head-to-head fight with him, as Tim Pawlenty fatally did with Mitt Romney in an earlier debate. Romney can't risk "pulling a Pawlenty," either, says The Washington Post's Theissen. He's also been "taking shots at Perry," and he'll have to repeat them to Perry's face.
 3. Everyone will attack Perry and Romney This is already essentially a race between Romney and Perry, and their "obvious debate strategy is to survive without any damage," says The Washington Post's Jonathan Bernstein. So "you probably won't see them attack each other." If any of the other candidates still think they have a shot, their "strategic imperative" is to "take out one of the frontrunners." That means Jon Huntsman tries to knock off Romney, while all the other "fringe candidates" target Perry.
 4. Everyone will namecheck Reagan With the debate at the Reagan Library, "everyone who is participating will be trying to out-Reagan one another," says Jason Linkins at The Huffington Post. In fact, it's already started in an odd Lone Star showdown: Rep. Ron Paul just released an ad slamming Perry as a "cheerleader" who "helped lead Al Gore's campaign to undo the Reagan revolution" in 1988. In a first, Perry struck back, noting Paul's "Reagan-bashing" letter from 1987. Let's be clear: "Reagan is to conservatives what Martin Luther King Jr. is to the Civil Rights Movement," says Tony Lee at Human Events. So any candidates who fail to honor Reagan's legacy will lose, big time.View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:Opinion Brief: Is Hillary running in 2012?Opinion Brief: Scott Brown for president?Opinion Brief: General Petraeus for president?Like on Facebook - Follow on Twitter - Sign-up for Daily Newsletter

The office pool has 2 to 1 odds that when the GOP 'love fest' ends there will be Santorum all over the stage and all the potential candidates will have SWAK tattoo'd on their backsides.

It's completely irrelevent, the pandering to the right will isolate Huntsman (evolution) even though he is the only intelligent one.The right will NEVER elect a mormon and the rest are regarded as wackos by 75% of the country.

All the GOP candidates will lie , leave out facts  and say a lot if stupid stuff. during the debate. Then to cover it all up the TEA party will have it`s members go to Wikipedia and rewrite the pages to reflect that the crap that was said in the debate  will look like the truth..... As they say you can`t fix stupid...

Rick Perry is further right than George Bush and will never win a general election.

My prediction - Perry makes several blatantly false statements. The next day the Tea Party says hes a hero and his poll numbers go up.

Can't you just see it now? Sarah is introduced at the GOP Convention and again the camera shifts to Bristol, complete with her own little "Obama" in her arms! A little half-breeding from a halfwit!1  Wonderful!

Here's a little poll: Which "Presidency" will Sarah win 1st? The U.S. Presidency, or the Presidency of the NAACP!! ? lol

After the debate, tune in to the GOP/Family Values channel for the new Sarah Palin "documentary", "what do you do when your Princess joins the Zoo". Brought to you by the KKK and the NAACP!!!

I'm not supporting any of these clowns.  The Republican party has shown me, and millions of others, that they favor only the rich and corporations.  In this election, they will experience a backlash from middle America...and they should.  They may fool a few uninformed, but they are not fooling me.

They will only go after Obama, not each other. Remember, they don't want the tea party to get upset with them! The winner is also looking for a VP so they will not ask each other any tough questions. Paul might!

Does anyone else find it interesting that when you're educated and intelligent, you tend to be a liberal, and when you're a moron, without education, and are easily influenced by people like Limbaugh, and Hannity, you're a conservative? Funny isn't it.

I was seriously thinking about being a Republican, but then I decided to finish high school and get my teeth fixed.

Well, there 'ya go; see, I'm not the only one who thinks Ricky-poo is Stupid.  Turns out it's all over the internet, who woulda thunk hahahahahahahhaha.  Of course, the problem is the American people don't have any trouble voting for Stupid Politicians; recent history has proven this to be true, W being the latest case.  We're doomed I tells 'ya.

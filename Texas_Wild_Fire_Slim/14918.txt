President, PM condemn Quetta blasts


ISLAMABAD - 7th September 2011 

By APP


President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani on Wednesday strongly condemned the twin bomb blasts outside the residence of DIG Frontier Corps in Quetta and the loss of several precious innocent lives.
The President said the government was determined to root out extremism and terrorism from the country and would not be deterred by such acts of terror.
He directed the provincial authorities for an immediate probe into the incident and to track down those who planned and executed the attack so that they may be awarded strict punishments. He also asked them to provide best possible care to those injured in the attack.
While both also expressed their deep sorrow and grief to the families of those who lost their loved ones and prayed to Allah Almighty to shower His blessings on them.
They also prayed for courage to the families to bear their loss with equanimity.

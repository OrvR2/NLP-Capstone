Authorities say he was the only person in the building and was not injured. His name wasn't released.
Earlier reports indicated he had hostages, but an Oakland police officer told The Associated Press no one else was in the business.
Police say they first responded shortly before 10 p.m. Friday to check on a report that the Emeryville store had been left open and discovered the suspect there.
The Oakland Tribune reported police described the suspect as wearing a mask from the action film "V for Vendetta" and armed with a handgun.

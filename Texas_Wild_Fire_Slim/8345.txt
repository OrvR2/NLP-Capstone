Gunmen attacked a prison in the southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, freeing a former militia leader and allowing close to 1,000 inmates to escape, a local official told AFP.
"Eight armed and masked men got off a minivan and took advantage of visiting day to gain access unnoticed. They opened fire on the police and the military guards, killing two," Katanga provincial interior minister Dkianga Kazadi said.

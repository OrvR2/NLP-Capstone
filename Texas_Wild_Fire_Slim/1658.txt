Guy Ritchie has become a father for a second time on Monday morning as he welcomed a new life together with 29-year-old model girlfriend Jacqui Ainsley. The as-of-yet-unnamed baby boy, delivered via Caesarean section according to the Daily Mail, will be the half-brother to boys Rocco and David from the "Sherlock Holmes" director's previous, and much-paparazzi'd marriage to Madonna, which ended in 2008.

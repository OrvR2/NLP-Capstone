Did the media ignore lack of applause at Obama’s Navy Yard speech?By Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – 13 hrs ago


Did the news media expose its liberal bias by ignoring a clip of a group of naval officers who needed to be instructed to applaud President Barack Obama? That's what several conservative pundits are asking, after a video of the incident in early August surfaced this week.
As Obama was introduced at the Washington Navy Yard on Aug. 5, he approached the podium to "Hail to the Chief." The assembled officers did not applaud. The senior officer who introduced the president, sensing the awkward silence, said, "You can go ahead and cheer, too." The crowd, some of who were taking photos, dutifully clapped hands.

"Perhaps it's protocol not to cheer until told to when in the military," Ben Howe, a blogger for RedState.com, wrote. "But if that's true, the media has some explaining to do as to why they went after Bush for the same thing in 2005."
Howe is referring to how the national news media covered a similar incident in June of that year, when President George W. Bush gave a speech at Fort Bragg and applause was initiated by a White House staff member.
As Howe noted, Terry Moran, reporting for ABC News, said at the time, "I must tell you that applause was initiated by a member of the White House advance team."
On NBC, Brian Williams said, "Some folks at home no doubt were curious about the lack of applause breaks. By pre-agreement between the White House and Fort Bragg, there was no entry applause as the soldiers were at attention. We were 23 minutes into it before the first break for applause."
"It was my observation that that one applause break was actually triggered by members of the president's advance team," NBC's Kelly O'Donnell told Williams. "They were just a few feet from me. They started to applaud— applause is contagious, and it then swept through the room. There was applause when the president left the room after the speech was over but people in uniform here told me that they had planned to be polite and to follow protocol."
But even if the Naval officers were following protocol, Howe wrote, "it's media bias on display."
"How come that bit of tape isn't by now famous?" Washington Post columnist Erik Wemple asked. "Why hasn't it been chewed over by every cable news outlet in the land?"
Perhaps it's because on Aug. 5, the cable news outlets were focused on the stock market's 513-point plunge.
As The Cutline noted that day, "cable and network news channels scrambled to cover the historic drop, with ABC, NBC and CBS breaking into their afternoon programming to air brief reports after the markets closed, and CNBC and Fox Business--which went commercial-free to cover the close--planning special primetime coverage."

They were taking photos, so is that not enough reason why there wasn't so much applause? Duh!

As the liberal smear machine continues to attack us, it is critical that we stay on the offensive!  Maxine Waters, Andre Carson, Jimmy Hoffa, Jr., and the other corrupt advocates of big government are attacking us because they see that our policies are on the verge of taking a permanent hold. What we are about to accomplish with the Postal Reform Act is just the beginning. 

As we approach a victory on overhauling the $8.5 BILLION annual deficit of the United States Post Office (USPS), they know that these fiscally responsible policies will spread to other bloated government agencies. Together, we have taken a virtually unknown piece of legislation and forced it into the forefront of the national political agenda by sending more than 130,000 letters to elected representatives in Washington.  If we can get the Postal Reform Act across the finish line, other bad fiscal policy (NPR, National Endowment For The Arts, Dept. of Education, EPA, etc.) will not be far behind. 

In a last ditch attempt to deny us victory on the Postal Reform Act, the union hacks have offered a proposal that is unbelievably irresponsible. Their proposal would raid the pension accounts of USPS employees to subsidize the annual deficit. While the Tea Party is fighting to ensure that the hardworking men and women of the USPS and their families get the pension plans they agreed to, the corrupt union leaders and their lackeys in Congress seek to raid their retirement accounts to temporarily subsidize their unsustainable spending. The truth is that it is the Tea Party, not the union bosses, fighting to protect the working man. 

We cannot let them steal this victory at the last moment!  Yesterday, we mentioned this important legislation and only about 6,000 letters were sent.  The victory is far from secure, WE MUST DO BETTER!  Using our system, it will only take you a couple of minutes to contact your elected representatives and you are NOT required to make a contribution to participate.  We know how busy you are but if you will sacrifice just a couple of minutes we can secure this critical victory that is so close!  Even if you have already sent one batch of letters when we told you about this weeks ago, our system will allow you to do it again (once every 10 days).  If you will send your letters right now, we can easily send another 50,000 or 100,000 letters today.  Don’t rely on somebody else to do it--be the change you want to see in government! *You are not required to donate to use the petition system but a generous contribution makes it possible for us to continue to offer everyone this service free-of-charge.

The naval officers are educated people.  I am not a naval officer however, you learn that applause is held to certain parts of the speech or to the end.  Unless otherwise instructed to applause in the middle of the President's speech would have shown a sign of disrespect to the speaker.  This called business etiquettes.  The republican tea party members need to be exposed to mannism instead of all the hitting and beatum up bullying talk.

With all the problems that we face as a nation this is what we discuss? No wonder things are so bad. We focus on the cosmetic and ignore the issues.

AND NOW the REST of THE STORY
Yahoo top exec resign recently after thirty months in her post, and I like the new direction of reporting fairly (the good, the bad, and the ugly) of both major political parties.  It’s in Yahoo’s hands to continue this trend and reach out to more users. 
Good luck Yahoo.

they were at the position of attention, and as such would have stayed that way until instructed to do otherwise.

This is clearly an article written from the mind of a very petty, fickle, sick and unhealthy idiot. Wake up and join the real world. Nobody cares about some level of applause in the past? Maybe a sick puppy! America people are hurting real bad and need jobs. Any American who is not demanding our elected officials do their jobs by 'Working Together' to timely solve the painful jobs problem in America is worthless trash. Be a part of the solution, and not an obvious part of the problem. Damn the petty trash talking and fickle bickering. Put America First. Get on board with supporting a healthier America and humanity...Work Together for the greater good for ALL our children.

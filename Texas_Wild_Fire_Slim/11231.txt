Texas Forest Service Budget As High As It Has Ever Been.
Trivia Tidbit of the Day: Part 940 -- Texas Did Not Slash Firefighting Capabilities-
There's plenty of (almost joyful, schadenfreude-inspired) chatter out there on the left, relishing the wildfires in Texas. One of the arguments liberals are making right now is that Texas "slashed" its wildfire fighting budget. So, is that so?
No: 

click for larger version
The Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Account appropriation for the 2012-13 biennium is comparable to amounts included in previous budgets signed by Gov. Perry. A one-time increase in funding for the 2010-11 biennium included funding for recommended capital costs like new equipment. Included below are the appropriations amounts for the Texas Forest Service for each budget signed by Gov. Perry. The Volunteer Firefighter Service Account is included in the total Texas Forest Service appropriation.

The Texas legislature traditionally makes supplemental appropriations to provide additional funding to cover unexpected costs related to disasters, including wildfires. This year, the legislature approved $121 million in supplemental spending of this sort. The threat of unpredictable natural disasters including as wildfires is precisely why Gov. Perry insisted that Texas’ 2012-13 budget not include any spending from the state’s Rainy Day Fund, which currently has an estimated balance of $6.5 billion.
    Texas Forest Service appropriations    
    Biennium      Total (in millions)
    2002 – 2003   $43.5
    2004 – 2005   $70.6
    2006 – 2007   $72.4
    2008 – 2009   $75.2
    2010 – 2011   $109.2
    2012 – 2013   $75.4
This bunk about wildfires and "slashed" budgets reminds me a lot of the other bogus, misleading, and ignorant reporting about the Texas budget, usually by non-Texans, over the past several months.
Texas didn't "slash" anything. If anything, the state firefighting budget is as high as it has ever been, and the Texas Forest Service is as well-equipped and well-prepared as it has ever been, with more recently-trained volunteer firefighters than ever before. There was a one-time surge in Texas Forest Service spending for equipment, from 2009 stimulus dollars, into the 2010-2011 biennial budget. That temporary surge was never intended to be a new baseline. It was for one-time capital expenditures.
You wonder why there's a spending problem in Washington? This mentality of never, ever being able to return to the normal baseline of spending after a supposedly temporary injection of stimulus is a perfect example of why budgets are out of control in Washington and balanced in Texas.
UPDATE:
And here's a video version of this graphic:

Previous Trivia Tidbit: Shattering Texas Education Myths.

Myths and flat out lies about Texas and Rick Perry- Education.
Trivia Tidbit of the Day: Part 939 -- Liberal Criticisms Against Texas: That Dog Won't Hunt-
Barack Obama's Secretary of Education Arne Duncan decided to weigh in on Texas' education system last week, making a politically driven attack on Rick Perry on behalf of a feckless President whose numbers are tanking. It was an epic failure.
Education reporter Rodger Jones of the Dallas Morning News, certainly no conservative, blasted Duncan:
Education Secretary Arne Duncan's insult to Texas public education was a politically motivated distortion that doesn't become a federal official in his position.

What a load this guy is.
We shouldn't hear lies come out of the mouth of the nation's top education official...
"Lies" is a pretty strong word. After all, Andrew J. Rotherham of Time magazine took issue with Duncan, but being a Time magazine writer, he gave the Education Secretary the benefit of the doubt, saying he was "confused" by the politically motivated attack on Texas.
So what was the deal? What did Duncan say that was so egregious as to raise the ire of even the left-leaning education press?
More from Rodger Jones of the DMN:
The tipoff that Duncan doesn't care about facts was his statement about "massive increases in class size in Texas" during Rick Perry's time in the governor's office.

Does that sound right to you -- considering the fact that the 22-1 class-size cap has been in place that whole time for primary grades?
I checked TEA records on statewide class size averages. Primary grades held steady, of course, while most secondary class averages went down during the Perry years.
Examples: Secondary math classes averaged 20.3 students in 2000-01 and dropped to 18.5 by last year. Average size of secondary English/language arts classes fell from 20.2 students in 2000-01 to 17.8 by last year.
Anybody could look this stuff up. It's right there on the TEA website. Duncan surely has a few thousand employees who could help him find it.
Class sizes fell under Rick Perry. Period. And, yet, Duncan asserted "massive increases" in class size. That really does seem to cross the line from "confused" into just "flat out lying," as Ed Morrissey put it over at Hot Air. 
Even the New York Times got in on the action, in Paul Krugman's usual spot (he's sort of on vacation), imploring people not to mess with Texas:
When a 2009 McKinsey study contrasted Perry’s home state to the similarly sized and situated California, it found that Texas students were “one to two years of learning ahead of California students of the same age, even though Texas has less income per capita and spends less per pupil than California.”

When it comes to minority achievement, Texas looks even better: On the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress math exam, black eighth graders in Texas outscored black eighth graders in every other state.
This is incredibly important. Texas has been a sponge for migrants both from inside the country and from foreign countries, particularly Mexico. Texas is now a minority-majority state. This is important when averaging the score of millions of people together. As I've noted before here (with a great assist from Iowahawk), Texas' white kids outperform the nation's white kids, Texas' black kids outperform the nation's black kids, and Texas' Hispanic kids outperform the nation's Hispanic kids.

The RAND Corporation studied this phenomenon, as well, and confirmed that Texas students outperform their national counterparts.
Texas can boast the top 2 public high schools in America. Plus 6 of the top 14. 7 of the top 20. And 13 of the top 38:

The next time someone claims Texas ranks "near the bottom" in education, ask them to read this post and get back with you.
The Heritage Foundation mocks Duncan's "crocodile tears" and explains how mediocrity has become the name of the game in the national education discussion: 68 percent of districts across the United States are below the 50th percentile in mathematics achievement. In more than half of states, no more than three districts have average student math performance that would place students in the upper third of math achievement in international comparisons.
Indeed, while beating national averages is not necessarily anything to write home about, it is still critical to acknowledge that the Texas model, far from perfect, has beaten the Chicago model. The Texas model may even very well may be a model for closing the minority achievement gap in other states, as well.
Knowing all of this, watch the hackery from the Obama lackey for yourself:

Texas Commissioner of Education Robert Scott fired back with some facts:
    -- In 2009, Texas ranked 7th in a 26 state comparison of the only states reporting four-year on-time graduation rates. That year Texas' on-time graduation rate was 80.6%. The Texas on-time graduation rate for 2010 is now 84.3%, an amazing 3.7 percentage point increase in a single year on the dropout indicator that you are now requiring all states to report to the Department.

    -- The Texas class of 2011 posted a record-high math score on the ACT college entrance exam. The Texas average math score was 21.5 and was higher than the national average of 21.1. ACT scores from 2007 to 2011 showed increases in all four subjects.
    -- The 2009 NAEP Science results were impressive, as well. Texas' African American eighth-grade students earned the highest score in the nation and our Hispanic eighth-grade students were eighth. Only eighth-grade students attending the Department of Defense schools scored higher than Texas' white students who were tied with white students in Massachusetts. On the fourth-grade test, Texas' African American students out-performed their peers in every state accept Virginia and those students attending Department of Defense Schools. Texas' fourth-grade white students were ranked third behind only Virginia and Massachusetts.
This Duncan guy was chosen because he was a loyal player in the Chicago political machine, not because he is competent or innovative.
The smackdown he has received from even reporters who tend to sympathize with his team may mean we won't be hearing much from Arne Duncan for a while. This really blew up in Team Obama's face.
Texas has major education challenges, no doubt, both in K-12 and higher ed. The growth of local school district spending on extraneous facilities and administrators is a serious problem, for example. But if you want to bring weak sauce about Texas, as Obama's education guru did, prepare to look foolish.
Myth(s): debunked.
UPDATE: Didn't even notice this before. Arne Duncan used incorrectical grammars when criticizing Texas and Rick Perry.

Texas' Interest Payments On Government Debt: Third Lowest In America.
Trivia Tidbit of the Day: Part 938 -- Texas Debt Among Lowest In Nation-
From the Tax Foundation:
With so much recent discussion of the fiscal outlook of the federal government, it's worth looking at the solvency of state governments as well. Today's map shows how much interest on their debt the states pay as a percentage of their direct spending.

Texas also has the second lowest debt per capita at the state government level:

Texas also has the second lowest state debt as a percentage of personal income. 
While it is true that voters in Texas have approved far more bond debt, mostly for roads, in the past decade (voters, even conservative Texas voters, tend to vote "yes" to almost any shiny objects on the ballot), those bonds are at least paid for with fees and assessments, and they are targeted and temporary, for specific purposes like infrastructure. 
Texas has seen its non-self-supporting debt (the kind that gets you in trouble because the money is spent on who-knows-what and there's no mechanism for paying back the borrowing) fall significantly in recent years, to the tune of roughly 16%.
Forbes ranks Texas number four (meaning, one of the best) on its debt weight scorecard, and gives Texas four stars out of four for avoiding a state debt disaster. All this, and Texas remains a donor state, contributing more in taxes to Washington than it receives back in federal benefits.
Moreover, while America got downgraded under President Obama, Texas got a credit upgrade under Rick Perry. 
So, to recap:
Texas has the second lowest debt per capita in America, as well as the third lowest interest payments on the debt of any state, despite it being a donor state, according to the Tax Foundation.
Forbes gives Texas four stars for its debt situation, and ranks Texas fourth in the country for the best handling of debt.
Texas also has the second lowest debt in the country, as a percentage of personal income, has reduced its non-self-supporting debt substantially over the past decade, and had its bond rating recently upgraded.
While Texans ought to keep an eye on all of that voter-approved local debt, and possibly make it harder for bond issues to make it onto the ballot in the first place, Texas' debt situation under Governor Rick Perry is a great story to tell, relative to America's debt explosion under Barack Obama.

VIDEO: "It's Time For Rick Perry" (Students for Perry)
The Students for Perry have put out a video today highlighting Texas Governor Rick Perry's unmatched record of job creation:

Will Governor Perry take the leap and get into the race, perhaps even in the next few weeks? I wholeheartedly hope so. No other candidate in the race provides this sort of contrast with President Obama on jobs and the economy.
With the market just tanking today and the jobs figures for July coming out tomorrow, this is a timely video from Students for Perry, indeed.

Five Truly Amazing Facts About The Texas Economy
Trivia Tidbit of the Day: Part 937 -- Since 2006, Texas Adds 2.75 Times More New Jobs Than All Other States Combined-
In this post, there are five truly amazing facts about the Texas economy. They're all recapped at the end, so don't have an anxiety attack if you miss them.
Between June 2006 and June 2011, only nine states plus Washington, DC added any net new non-farm jobs. Of the adders over that period, Texas added 2.75 times more new jobs than the others combined:

click image for larger version
Texas is the big winner in On Numbers’ midyear analysis of employment trends.

Texas added 537,500 nonfarm jobs between June 2006 and June 2011, based on the latest seasonally adjusted figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
That’s nearly 10 times larger than the second-biggest increase by any state over the five-year span, Louisiana’s gain of 55,900 nonfarm jobs. North Dakota was third with a raw increase of 41,700.
Texas added 73.4% of the nation's net new non-farm jobs since 2006, nearly ten times more than that of second place Louisiana, and more than one-hundred times the figure of barely-positive New York (the lone blue state with a net gain over the past five years).
Indeed, these numbers are staggering:

Over this same period, California lost a net 1,009,400 jobs.
The most common "rebuttal," if you can call it that, from the left, is that Texas only added a bunch of minimum wage jobs, so none of the facts above really count, somehow. The problem with that argument is that Texas has outpaced the nation in wage growth, as well. Texas is also number one in new manufacturing jobs, new aerospace jobs, new energy jobs, new professional and business services jobs, new finance jobs, and new construction jobs.
Since the recession officially "ended" and "recovery" began in June of 2009, Texas has added exactly as many jobs as all other states combined:
From June 2009 to June 2011 the state added 262,000 jobs, or half the USA's 524,000 payroll gains, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even by a more conservative estimate that omits states with net job losses, Texas' advances make up 30% of the 1 million additions in the 34 states with net growth.

....
Economists point to an array of factors, including high energy prices that set off an oil-drilling frenzy, rising exports and a conservative banking industry that helped the state sidestep the housing crash.
Yet while energy has been a spark — employment in natural gas, oil and other mining sectors rose by 45,000, or 23%, since the recession ended — growth has been broad-based. During the past two years, professional and business services added 74,000 jobs; education and health care gained 91,000; and leisure and hospitality grew by 29,000, according to BLS.
Hear that, naysayers? Texas' "growth has been broad-based." Meanwhile, Texas, already the nation's number one exporting state, saw exports rise 21% compared to 15% for the nation as a whole (which includes Texas; the gap would be larger if not for Texas being included in the national figures). Texas accounts for about 8% of the U.S. population but 16.5% of our nation's exports.
Is it any wonder, then, that so many Americans are clamoring for Texas Governor Rick Perry to jump into the race for the White House and save our nation from the disaster that is Obamanomics?
So, about those five amazing facts. Here they are:
1. Over the past five years, Texas has added 275% more net new jobs than all other job-adding states combined.
2. Since 2006, Texas has added well over 100 times more net new jobs than New York has added.
3. Texas is where 537,500, or 73.4%, of America's net new jobs have been created over the past five years; this figure is nearly ten times greater than the second place Louisiana (55,900, or 7.6% of America's total).
4. Since the recession "ended" in 2009, Texas has added exactly as many net new jobs as the rest of America combined.
5. Texas accounts for only about 8% of the nation's population but 16.5% of U.S. exports.

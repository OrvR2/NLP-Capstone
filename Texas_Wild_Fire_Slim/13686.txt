Photo of Mt. Edna erupting in 2001
On the evening of January 11, 2011 an increase in volcanic tremor was recorded at Mt Etna volcano in Italy. Seismic activity reached a peak at 07:00 AM on January 12th when the source moved from north of NE crater to the SE crater. This corresponded to weak eruptive activity at SE crater on January 11th. The January 12th eruptions increased with strombolian activity recorded at SE crater.  About 11:00 PM, lava overflowed the eastern rim of SE crater, and fed a flow that moved toward the western wall of the Valle del Bove.

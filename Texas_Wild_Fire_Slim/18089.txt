BASTROP, Texas (AP) - The number of homes destroyed in a devastating Central Texas wildfire has risen to nearly 800, but an official says firefighters had a "good night" battling the blaze.
The Texas Forest Service said Wednesday that the Bastrop County blaze had consumed 785 homes, and more than 1,000 homes statewide have been reported lost in the past three days. But Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald says no structures were lost overnight in the battle to contain the 33,000-acre blaze about 25 miles east of Austin. Officials say containment remains at 30 percent.
The forest service says it responded to 19 new fires Wednesday totaling 1,490 acres, bringing the count over the past week to more than 170 fires consuming more than 130,000 acres.

United Express plane skids off runway in OttawaBy Jeffrey Hodgson | Reuters – Sun, Sep 4, 2011

TORONTO (Reuters) - No one was injured when a United Express plane from Chicago carrying 44 passengers and three crew members skidded off the runway while landing in Ottawa Sunday afternoon.
All the passengers and crew members from United Express Flight 3363 left the plane and were taken to the airport terminal on a city bus, said Marc Messier, a spokesman for Ottawa Fire Services.
"When we arrived, they were pretty much all off the plane," he said, adding none of the passengers immediately requested medical attention.
Emergency crews sprayed foam on a large amount of fuel that had leaked from the plane, an Embraer ERJ 145, he said.
A Reuters photographer at the airport said the plane, still surrounded by emergency vehicles, was sitting off the runway and appeared to have a damaged right wing.
Trans States Airlines, the operating carrier of the flight, said in a statement that it "cannot speculate as to the cause of the incident," but it will provide more information as it becomes available.
Trans States Airlines also said it will be involved in the investigation, which is being lead by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada.
United Express flights are operated by various regional carriers working with United Continental Holdings.

This is the second time that one of these planes (which are not equipped with reverse thrusters) has skidded off the runway in Ottawa. The runway is long enough and well maintained; so what does that tell you?

Just last week a Delta Connection (Atlantic Southeast Airlines) from Atlanta had to make an emergency landing when the left wheel refused to come down. The plane was a CRJ-200 carrying about fifty passengers (none of which were injured).

I hear Perry is a big fan of Canada. In fact, he praised Canada's healthcare system once years ago. Maybe that and the plane crash events are related somehow because Perry is a Teabagger demon.

The pilot should have paid better attn to what he was doing than coping a feel of the stewardesses leg.

I'm not an expert, but looking at the photos supplied, the plane is sitting on it's belly. Either the pilot didn't lower the gears before landing and verified they were down or they sheered off.

In the States the paranoia about another hijacking by terrorists makes boarding a commercial carrier today harder to achieve than it was to board what was the former Soviet Unions national airline, Aeroflot. 

We're all afraid a big hijack event will happen again. But what if instead of one big bang, terrorists decide to strike in Canada and the U.S. and around the world, in small ways like this? 
Our planes fuselage rips in mid-air, the landing gear fails, an engine poops out, a train derails, etc... Little matters of inconvenience that can be, or are, life threatening. 

Small seemingly dis-missable acts of terrorism, attributed instead to "mechanical failure".  Gaging the impact those events have on emergency response, citizens reactions, media coverage, etc... 
It's like those undercover video's in commercial kitchens, where angst driven angry employees don't burn the restaurant down. Instead they pis& in the giant vat of soup. Jack off in the lemon chiffon pie mix, etc...  Small acts of rage, missed and yet impacting. 

Same thing with news reports like this all over the world. Sure, it can be mechanical failure, and yet what if it's not? 

There's that old war axiom about hiding in plain sight. What better tactic to impact through terrorism than to exercise an agenda in small seemingly benign acts? Hiding in plain sight, what event after event, has an impact on revenue and lives.

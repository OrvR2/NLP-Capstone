I hear a prop driven plane right after the DC10s run! What is he﻿ doing?

@KC8YOQ . This had turned into quite﻿ an aerial show, especially for the media. There was multiple aircraft all over this fire. They were also pre-treating a ridgeline just directly behind me when I was sooting this video and you most likely hear the USFS Lead Plane.

we should use MORE airliners and﻿ cargo planes for this.
Like the C-17 for example.

» More Information on Texas Wildfires

AUSTIN, Texas – Wildfire survivors in Waller and Montgomery counties can meet with state and federal specialists at a recovery center opening soon in their area. 
Monday through Wednesday, specialists from the state of Texas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Small Business Administration will be on hand to answer questions and provide information on the types of assistance available to survivors. They also have brochures and other written materials on disaster recovery.
The schedule is:
Waller and Montgomery Counties  Field Store Community Center 26098 FM 362 North, near the intersection of FM 1488 Waller, TX  77484
1 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday, Sept. 26  9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 27  9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 28
Any Texas survivor who has questions about the recovery process or who needs help registering with FEMA is urged to stop by a center. Visiting with a recovery specialist is not a requirement for survivors who want disaster assistance, but the centers are an excellent way for people to get answers to their questions about disaster aid and help applying for it.
Texans can register online at www.disasterassistance.gov, via web-enabled phone at m.fema.gov, or by telephone via FEMA’s toll-free numbers: 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or TTY 1-800-462-7585. Those who use 711-Relay or Video Relay Services can call 1-800-621-3362. Operators are available by phone from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. seven days a week.

FEMA’s mission is to support our citizens and first responders to ensure that as a nation we work together to build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards. Last Modified: Monday, 26-Sep-2011 14:18:34

Gay priest was 9/11's first recorded casualty 
By Dan Gilgoff, CNN.com Religion Editor
You may not hear a lot about gay Roman Catholic priests.
But one such clergyman is getting a lot of attention this week: Father Mychal Judge, a Franciscan friar who donned a brown robe and sandals and who was the first recorded casualty of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.
Among the many hats Judge wore was as chaplain for the New York Fire Department. He was killed after going to the World Trade Center with some off-duty firefighters after the first plane hit.
Much of the coverage Judge is getting this week refers to him as the âSaint of 9/11,â the name of a 2006 documentary about the priest that was produced by a gay activist.
An apparently celibate priest, Judge reportedly told few about his sexual orientation. He made no secret, meanwhile, that he was a recovering alcoholic, attending two Alcoholics Anonymous meetings a month.
An NPR profile of Judge presents a portrait of an irreverent holy man, one who could curse a blue streak but who spent evenings returning the dozens of messages left on his answering machine from those seeking help:
Another retired fireman, Jimmy Boyle, agrees that Father Mychal was one of the boys â but not when he was performing religious ceremonies.
"He could go into the firehouse, have a cup of coffee, have a meal, listen to all the talk, watch the ballgame, hear your problems, talk about anything you want," Boyle says. "But when he said Mass in the firehouse, I always felt when he got to the Eucharist, he just transformed himself. He became like Christ. He was just so pious."
Judge was also pretty famous, at least in New York (heâd also managed to arrange a White House meeting with Bill Clinton). Hereâs how New York magazine opens its Judge profile:
One month after Mychal Judge's body was pulled from the shattered lobby of 1 World Trade Center, and three weeks after his televised funeral, some of the friar's friends decided to hold a smaller memorial evening of Celtic music and storytelling. Priests, nuns, lawyers, cops, firefighters, homeless people, rock-and-rollers, recovering alcoholics, local politicians, and middle-aged couples from the suburbs all streamed into the Good Shepherd Chapel on Ninth Avenue. Pete Hamill read one of his columns from the Daily News, the Irish band Morning Star played jigs and reels, and Malachy McCourt - actor, author, and irrepressible raconteur - stationed himself by the altar, briskly moving things along as emcee. The crowd was so motley, so colorful, it looked like the setup to a joke. (A priest, a lawyer, and an Irishman walk into a bar ... )
Thereâs a lot to learn from all this weekâs Judge remembrances, about the events of September 11, about New York life, about the workaday existence of priests. But one of the biggest lessons is how many religious people defy the stereotypes about them.

My Grandfather and uncle were both in the NYPD. I knew Father Mychal Judge; he was an amazing and well-respected man, even by the hardened and sometimes a tad bigoted guys of the NYFD houses he worked with. He also was well known to the NYPD, and when my uncle had his first child, Fr. Judge was there to help us celebrate the child's baptism. The man was full of joy and love and peace. He had a communion with God that I've rarely seen with other priests, and my father worked at a seminary, so i grew up knowing a LOT of priests – this man was authentis – he was the real deal – whether or not his orientation was gay had no effect on his relationship with God, you could SEE the closeness and peace he felt with his Creator. Anyone who thinks that God cares who you love is a lunatic. God cares THAT you love, and that you spread your love and joy and ability to share God around with no hate or bigotry. 
Anything else really isn't "god". It's a nice facsimile, but it isn't the real thing.
Fr. Mychal Judge was, and the world is a sadder place with out him, but a richer place for once having had him. Bless you, Fr. Myke – we miss  you.

If anyone was ever desined for a reserved spot in Heaven, it was Fr. Judge. He raced to the Trade Towers to give Last Rites to anyone hurt, or dying, and ended up dying himself. With no thought of his own safety, just like the rest of the First Responders, Fr. Mychal Judge reported to the scene of one of the most heinous events on American shores in our short history. And just like nearly 3,000 other innocent souls that day, he lost his life because of a twisted view of religion. 
The Suicide Bombers/Terrorists were not true Muslims because Islam does not condone the killing of innocents. They twisted their own religion to suit their own prejudices against the U.S. It churns my stomach to see you doing the same – twisting religion and casting aspersions on a wholly holy man because of your bigotry and fear and confusion and hate – in that respect, you are no better than thre men who guided those planes into those buildings I watched being built with my Grandfather when I was young. 
Can we not be *better* than that? In 10 years, have we learned nothing? Or have we just learned how to hate better?
I knew a holy, blessed, spiritual, loving, wonderful, Godly man; one of many who was killed on that ugly day. I feel sorry you will never learn his lessons of tolerance and healing and faith and love. He was a better man than those Terrorists. His religion wasn't twisted. He communed with God. I don't know that I can say that for you.

To those who claim the bible to be utter and complete truth,
Is it really so hard to believe that a person could read and study earnestly, giving their heart to the task, praying for understanding and come up with a completely different conclusion than you did?
My story is fairly long and not related to the post at hand, but believe me when I tell you that I WANTED to believe.  I prayed, hell, I pleaded with what I thought was God to take away the doubt.  Eventually my prayers were answered and the doubt went away, I accepted the truth and walked away from that idea of God, and from that book, that religion.
So, telling me to read, to study, to pray...trust me when I tell you I have.  And it led me here.

@Hope, once again, as I've said, I've been there.  I was a born again Christian for 15ish years.  My doubts began with whether or not any of it was real, which led me to a deeper study and more prayer.  Which led me to more doubts about the validity of what I believed, which led me to deeper study and more prayer.  That, ultimately, led me to believe that the bible is no more "the word of god" than any other scripture.

Hope said: "He wants to have a personal relationship with you."
Hmm... This is not to be confused with the personal relationship that several priests wished to have with altar boys.
"Doubt" is the adult response to anything, for which there is no evidence. Only children under the age of 6, should suspend their critical thinking and believe in magic.

Magic
David Johnson,
"Only children under the age of 6, should suspend their critical thinking and believe in magic."
Correct.  While it is enjoyable (even for adults) to suspend critical thinking for a time once in a while to, for example, believe that Donald Duck is 'really' talking, or that Superman 'really' hears people's screams for help from halfway around the world and flies in pronto to save them, we simply cannot effectively live constantly in that fantasy world.

Recorded casualty means that his was the first body they pulled from the wreckage of the buildings.  There were not many recorded casualties because most of the bodies were never recovered.  They were all casualties, however.

Who is guilty of gayness, the pope or the priests?
I really regret the death of Mr . Judge. However, I wonder, how a priest could be gay (actually I yet don't wonder).
It is clear that a priest should not be gay, and even nobody (no ordinary man) should be gay. It is a heavy sin. A priest should preach the gospel that Jesus can release from sins. Assumed, he is gay, his body preaches the opposite: Jesus cannot release from sin. Thus, gays should not be allowed to reach out for ecclesiastical offices, but they should repent.
The pope is highly responsible for the se-xual transgressions of the Catholic priests. The pope doesn't allow them to marry, thus their hormonal balance gets confused and they start to touch men and children, before they burst.
Thus, the greatest gay and worst child abuser on earth is the pope. By the magical sacrament of consecration and ordination he is connected with his bishops and priest. The whole Catholic priesthood is a magical body, the magical body of the pope, with the pope as it's head.
Conclusion: Let us abolish papacy and celibacy and we will strongly reduce se-xual crimes.
In contrast the real Church:
The real Christian Church is a holy place and the House of the Lord, his holy Temple. Jesus is the invisible head of the true Church, which is led by the Holy Spirit (Spirit of Christ and the Father).

Hate is NOT a family value
Please read this with a earnest heart and pray about it.
Matthew 7:1-5
    1DO NOT judge and criticize and condemn others, so that you may not be judged and criticized and condemned yourselves.
    2For just as you judge and criticize and condemn others, you will be judged and criticized and condemned, and in accordance with the measure you [use to] deal out to others, it will be dealt out again to you.
    3Why do you stare from without at the very small particle that is in your brother's eye but do not become aware of and consider the beam of timber that is in your own eye?
    4Or how can you say to your brother, Let me get the tiny particle out of your eye, when there is the beam of timber in your own eye?
    5You hypocrite, first get the beam of timber out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the tiny particle out of your brother's eye.

Judging Is Believing.
    Yes, and why, even of yourselves, do you not judge what is right? (Luke 12:57)
What is right?
    The statutes of the Lord are right (Psalm 19:8).
False Christians (and others) often tell us it is not right to judge. Some fools hypocritically condemn us for judging (Luke 6:37), and they all hypocritically judge that we judge.1 When we identify preachers as false teachers leading both themselves and those who follow them to hell, when we declare others as on their way to hell, and especially when we warn them they are lost, we often hear these words (or the equivalent), "Judge not" (Matthew 7:1). Yet, these words are exactly why we judge.
Jesus said,
    Judge not, that you be not judged. For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you. (Matthew 7:1-2)
Jesus also said,
    Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. (Luke 6:37a-b)
We take these words very seriously. They literally scare us. In fact, we are terrified of them (Psalm 119:120; Isaiah 66:2). We do not want to be judged by our "measure" as Christ warns in Matthew 7:1-2, because we know we fall short (Romans 3:23); and our measure is guaranteed to be faulty (Psalm 16:2).
Moreover, we desire not to be judged as the Lord says in Luke 6:37. We also desire not to be condemned as Jesus promises in Luke 6:37. Therefore, we strive, in the fear of God, to be certain to never judge and never condemn anyone.
This is why we have chosen to write and speak solely in accordance with God's judgments2 and Yehvah's condemnations, as it is written,
    With my lips I have declared all the judgments of Your mouth. (Psalm 119:13)
Everyone judges. No matter who you are, you make judgments every day. The most complacent judge there is nothing to be concerned about (Zephaniah 1:12). The most paranoid judge there is trouble everywhere (Proverbs 28:1). Everyone judges and makes judgments concerning their surroundings and those around them. Those with the mind of Christ judge according to Christ (1 Corinthians 2:15-16).3 Those with a mind of their own (Isaiah 65:2) judge according to their own and are among those described in Isaiah 5:20-21.
    Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
Amen.

Those who judge according to their own understanding (Proverbs 3:5) are those who are "prudent in their own sight" and they "call evil good and good evil," because the human heart is desperately wicked (Jeremiah 17:9) and does not rightly judge.
For example, false Christians typically think if a person claims to be a believer, they assume they are. In a perverted twist of Romans 10:9-10 they think if a person simply proclaims "Lord Jesus" and claims to believe God raised Him from the dead, they think such a one is saved. Such thinking is simplemindedness.
    The simple believes every word, but the prudent considers well his steps. (Proverbs 14:15)
Without submission to the Word of God (Scripture, John 1:1, Hebrews 4:13-14), confessing "the Lord Jesus" and claiming to "believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead" (Romans 10:9) is a meaningless and idle proclamation. Jesus said,
    Not everyone who says to Me, "Lord, Lord," shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?" And then I will declare to them, "I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!"
If a person is not one "who does the will of My Father" they are not saved. If they are those "who practice lawlessness," they are those who practice sin, for "sin is lawlessness" (1 John 3:4); and therefore, they are lost (1 John 3:4-10). But, those who judge against the Word judge such people to be Christians, when they are not. Thus, they "call evil good," and bring upon themselves the "Woe" of Isaiah 5:20.
God's judgments are what matter, and if we declare only His judgments (1 Corinthians 2:2), and not our own, we will escape the condemnation of Matthew 7:1-2 & Luke 6:37 and avoid the woe of Isaiah 5:20-21. For then, it is not us who judge, but Him, and His judgments are right (Psalm 119:7, 39, 62, 75).
Evidenced from the many who assail us as judging wrongly (because they themselves are judging wrongly), many think Matthew 7:1-2 & Luke 6:37 dictates a silence on the matters we judge (false teachers, people's lost condition, etc.), but such a perspective is only rebellion (Proverbs 17:11) and unbelief (Jude 5).
Amen.

God's Judgment
No one will escape God's judgment (Romans 2:7-10; 14:10-12; 2 Corinthians 5:10). All will be judged according to the Word of God (Hebrews 4:12-13). We know this, and this is why we judge as we do. Our judgment is simply a declaration of God's judgments that He has already made known (e.g. John 3:18 "condemned already"). We declare them. We are required to declare them (Psalm 105:1-6), and so we bear His reproach for doing so (2 Timothy 4:10; Hebrews 13:13). False christians (and others) hate the light (John 3:19-20), and so they foolishly proclaim, "Judge not." We refuse to heed this "Judge not" counsel of the ungodly (Psalm 1:1), for we do not want to be condemned with them (Luke 6:37). For in hypocrisy they judge, and in hypocrisy they condemn, and so they will receive their condemnation (John 5:29). We know this and proclaim it, because we believe what God says.
    And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, "I believed and therefore I spoke," we also believe and therefore speak (2 Corinthians 4:13).
Amen.

Rainer Braendlein
The tower of Siloam
I regret the death of Mr. Judge, but his gayness makes me nervous a little.
I see gayness as a heavy sin, but shall I say now, it served him (Mr. Judge) right that he died at 9/11?
Yet at Jesus time a tower had collapsed, and slain 18 people. It was the tower of Siloam. Jesus said that the slain people were not more guilty than other people. Jesus told the people, with whom he talked, would die the same way like the 18, if they would not repent of their sins.
Although we are tempted to judge gay people, because gayness is indeed a heavy sin, we should be aware that we are also sinners. There are a lot of sins beside gayness, which cause God's wrath. Nobody of us is without sin.
Conclusion: We and the gays should repent of our sins right now. Jesus has borne our sins on the cross. If we believe that and get baptized, Jesus will set us free from every vice (for-nication, greed for riches, power and honor, hate, shuffle, gluttony, laziness, bossiness, watching p-orn, etc.).
Gospel of Luke, Chapter 13:
1 There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 2 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things? 3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. 4 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? 5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
On more point:
We got pretty shocked by 9/11.
Why?
Many people died at the same time in a spectacular horrible way. 
However, for a single victim of 9/11 it was just his single death (although I must admit that I personally would not like do die by a jump).
If we die a normal death (caused by a disease, accident, execution, etc..) or if we die in connenction with a greater catastrophe, for us personally it amounts to the same thing.
Realistically seen, we can die every day, hour or second by any reason. Death is always at hand. It is only that we suppress this fact.
By the verses of Luke, Chapter 13 Jesus wants to tell us that we should be always aware of death. 
The ongoing minute can be the last time of our life, where we have opportunity to repent.
Thus, someone, who hears the gospel, should repent right now.
The gospel: Jesus died for our sins on the cross. Believe that and get baptized (if you have yet received infant baptism, don't get baptized again. Just refer to your infant baptism, which is valid.). Jesus will set you free by the power of his death and resurrection. At baptism your old man of sin dies and you resurrect together with Jesus to a new life (see Romans 6).
Gospel of Mark, Chapter 16:
15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.

Hate is NOT a family value
Why do you self proclaimed "Christians" never quote these verses?
Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death. (Exodus 21:15 NAB)
All who curse their father or mother must be put to death. They are guilty of a capital offense. (Leviticus 20:9 NLT)
If a man commits adultery with another man's wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death. (Leviticus 20:10 NLT)
A priest's daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors her father also, shall be burned to death. (Leviticus 21:9 NAB)
Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ. (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)
When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished. If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property. (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)
If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father. Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her. (Deuteronomy 22:28-29 NLT)

Obviously ordination in any religion is not assurance of good behavior !!!!!
Neither is coronation!!! e.g. Henry VIII, King David.
Neither is marriage as 50% of those men convicted of pedophilia are married. Is Rainer Braendlien married? If so, keep children away from him. 
Neither is being elected president of the USA!! e.g. Billy "I did not have se-x with that girl" Clinton, John "Marilyn Monroe" Kennedy"
Neither is possessing super athletic skill!!! e.g. Tiger "I am so sorry for getting caught" Woods.
Neither is being an atheist or pagan since pedophilia is present in all walks of life
If someone is guilty of a crime in this litany of "neithers" they should or should have been penalized as the law dictates to include jail terms for pedophiliacs (priests, rabbis, evangelicals, boy scout leaders, married men/women), divorce for adultery (Clinton, Kennedy, Woods), jail terms for obstruction of justice (Clinton, Cardinal Law) and the death penalty or life in prison for murder ("Kings David and Henry VIII).

Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son
It's no wonder HS is here all the time.  Can you imagine anyone wanting to visit with such a creature during convalescence?  I'll bet everyone who's ever known her is thrilled that she's removed from their presence.

Freudian slip Tomithia, your conscious is bubbling up threw all the baloney you piled on it through life.
You do care about the afterlife with Jesus.
God Bless your little former gay soul.
Amen.

"threw"?? "THREW"??  Oh, goody, there's another one for the lexicon of the nut.  
"Formerly gay soul"?  What drugs are you on, lady?  I've already explained to you that I'm not gay.  I've been married for 31 years.  What part of that do you not comprehend?
Never mind.  You're losing it.  Have they tested you for Alzheimer's?

Tomisthina, that was my Freudian slip.  I was thinking about you up chucking over your sinful ways.  You know, throwing up aka the threw instead of through.
Gotta go now.  You stay obsessed what True Christians post about His truth.
Amen.

Good luck with the white jacket that has the extra-long sleeves, HeavenStink.  I'm sure  you'll wear it well–it should fit you perfectly.

Reality is an only child having an adult temper tantrum when someone doesn't agree with his baloney posts.  One of his multiple handles is Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son.  Sends Tommie, Tom out to do his dirty work of the insults.
LOL.  Too pathetic Reality.
Amen.

Reality
Reality is my only handle.  And once again I come to assist HS in search for the truth.  This time with a prayer:
The Apostles' Creed 2011: (updated by yours truly and based on the studies of historians and theologians during the past 200 years)
Should I believe in a god whose existence cannot be proven
and said god if he/she/it exists resides in an unproven,
human-created,  spirit state of bliss called heaven??
I believe there was a 1st century CE, Jewish, simple,
preacher-man who was conceived by a Jewish carpenter
named Joseph living in Nazareth and born of a young Jewish
girl named Mary.  (Some say he was a mamzer.)
Jesus was summarily crucified for being a temple rabble-rouser by
the Roman troops in Jerusalem serving under Pontius Pilate,
He was buried in an unmarked grave and still lies
a-mouldering in the ground somewhere outside of
Jerusalem.
Said Jesus' story was embellished and "mythicized" by
many semi-fiction writers.  A descent into Hell, a bodily resurrection
and ascension stories were promulgated to compete with the
Caesar myths. Said stories were so popular that they
grew into a religion known today as Catholicism/Christianity
and featuring dark-age, daily wine to blood and bread to body rituals
called the eucharistic sacrifice of the non-atoning Jesus.
Amen

Oh, can it.  You're as nutty as your pal HS.  You probably share a room at the "inn".

Now Sid, along with Tom, Tom is just Reality, should I say, in drag (LOL).
Reality knows there aren't that many ridiculous atheists to post on these sites.  He has multiple handles, one wackier than the next.
Amen.

If anyone doubts that HS is mentally ill, just read her post about evolution and Batman and Robin.
Her family should have her involuntarily committed.

Did god p&ss in yours, sweetcheeks?  
Really, I hope those posting here have been keeping up with your diatribes,  you wonderful little Christian.  I'm sure everyone, including your god, is as appalled as I am that you dare to judge anyone else when your own soul is as black as the devil's heart.

Hey, HS.  Where is that post you claimed I wrote?  You said you could produce it.  Why haven't you?  Chicken?  Lame?  Stupid?
Yeah, you're all of those.

God Bless you Reality.

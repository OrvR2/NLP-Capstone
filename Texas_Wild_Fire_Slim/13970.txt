As the sun set on an airport hotel parking lot in Austin, Texas, Roger Cosby needed to tell his story.
He had just witnessed a sight that many Texans are battling – a devastating wildfire.
The state's largest blaze, a massive, uncontained fire in Bastrop County near Austin, has scorched some 25,000 acres, destroyed at least 470 homes and forced about 5,000 residents to evacuate.
That wildfire on Sunday was near the house Cosby shares with his companion of nine years, Cindy Boyd.
Cosby was taking a nap, while Boyd was working in their shop, making decorative plates.
Then Boyd smelled smoke.
"Roger, we have to go now, we have to go now," Cosby recalls Boyd saying as she woke him.
The Bastrop home that Boyd has lived in for 26 years was on fire.
Cosby says quickly jumped into their car with a few belongings and sped down a long driveway with flames surrounding them on both sides.
"It was like opening the door of an oven," Cosby says.
He says he fears they have lost everything: the house, a workshop, a greenhouse, a truck and worst of all – six acres of trees surrounding the house.
Roger Cosby holds decorative plates, some of the few possessions he was able to salvage.
"It was Cindy's forest," says Cosby, standing next to their getaway car.
He says they hope to return to the house on Tuesday for the first time since the fire to see if anything survived.
"It's all gone. There is no way anything could be left," Cosby struggles to say.
Boyd's forest is now likely a scorched, version of the area she loved so much. They assume charred limbs are all that remain.
Cosby says they have no plans to rebuild on the land they love so much because they believe it will never be the same.

I live in Texas. I have seen the fire – first hand. It's really really sad. Bastrop is having a hard time getting this fire under control due to the weather/dry conditions. It's hard to imagine a fire that is 20+ miles long!!! Other parts of Texas are having similar issues – east Texas...etc. I am hoping for rain. My heart goes out to the people who have lost EVERYTHING! 
If you want to help – please look at websites, such as the red cross. People in Texas always help when there are other disasters! (myself being a Texan who has helped when others needed it)

It is the biggest of dozens of fires burning across Texas and has consumed half of Bastrop State Park.

I haven't been here for a couple days, I guess I shouldn't expect any changes in the personalties that get on this forum. The words needed to describe some of the lowbrows are not allowed, but I have a feeling that their brains must really be fried by the drugs they use. I doubt that if they were to go though a catastrophe of this sort they would be snorting their best while they were suronded by flames and making wise cracks. I don't say this in jest, but it seems that Texas may soon have more wildfires than California ever had, which I thought held the record.  Like I've said to friends, in jest, but it is not funny any longer, all we need is a 8.+  earthquake in the east, an other huge hurricane in the south, 10 ft snow storms in the north, a devastating tsunami on the west coast and with the politicans we have in Washington and we just won't have a country left.

Oohh, justathought, "cancel,cancel" as my friend Helen says! Please don't join the prophet in the dooms day predictions! We're strong, determined & can get through this as people did in Joplin, as flood victims have in several states & as natural disaster survivors do, the world over! Also, we're not going to let the totally crazy people in Washington run things, we'll work with the semi-sane(lol)! The US is gonna be OK!! Y'all hear me!?!

I heard that funding was cut to the rural fire departments for fighting the fires down there and that it was Gov. Perry who slashed the budget. Is there any truth to that?

True, the hospitals should....apparently wardens accept bribes of bj's to allow net access for those missing a lot more than just their medications, poor jimmy and the rest of the hateful posters are proof no matter how hard they try... sucking will always be what they do best!

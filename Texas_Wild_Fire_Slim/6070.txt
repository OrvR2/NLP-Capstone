Ernest Willis, a 52-year-old New Hampshire man, was found guilty of raping and impregnating a 15-year-old girl from his church who was shipped to Colorado by church leaders to give birth to his baby. Willis faces up to 54 years in prison for the sexual assault, The Denver Post reports. Willis will be sentenced Tuesday in Merrimack Superior Court.
UPDATE:
The Associated Press reports that Ernest Willis was sentenced Tuesday to 15 to 30 years in prison for raping Tina Anderson twice in 1997. Judge Larry Smukler said that Willis "robbed the girl of her childhood." But Willis was stoic and although he said he was "sorry and ashamed for this thoughtless act of sexual misconduct," he never admitted to forcible rape or to a second rape. Willis' lawyers said they are planning to appeal those convictions.
EARLIER:
Tina Anderson, who was 15 at the time of the rape, knew Willis from babysitting his children and from attending the same fundamentalist Baptist church in Concord, N.H.. The church pastor made young Anderson apologize to the congregation when she discovered that she was pregnant, but she was not allowed to tell the church goers that the pregnancy occurred because she was raped. With the consent of Anderson’s mother, the pastor then shipped the teenager to the home of a Colorado couple that she didn’t know and arranged for her baby to be adopted, according to ABC News.
7News reports that Wayne Coull, prosecutor in the case, told jurors that Anderson “got shamed, shunned, silenced and sent away.”
Concord police had shelved the case back in 1997 when they couldn’t locate the victim, completely unaware she’d been moved to Colorado. But in 2010 they revived the case when they learned of her whereabouts, according to CBSDenver.
The girl was located, now as an adult, with the help of an online website for former Fundamentalist Baptists. 
Matt Barnhart, a former member of the Trinity Baptist Church who witnessed the day that Anderson was shamed and forced to apologize to the church described the event just last year on a website maintained by a group called “Independent Fundamentalist Baptist cult survivors,” the Houston Chronicle reports. The website founder contacted Barnhart and learned the girl’s identity and passed the information along to Concord police. 
After 13 years of keeping this secret, Anderson, now 29 and living in Arizona with her husband and three children, was contacted by police in 2010 to finally make a statement about the events of 1997, according to the UK Daily Mail.
The Associated Press reports that Anderson made this statement to the court:
When Ernie raped me, he destroyed the person I was and, in that moment, filled me with shame and guilt that I’ve battled against repeatedly. When he decided that his sexual gratification was the most important thing in his life, he shattered mine.
Willis had previously admitted to having sex with Anderson in 1997, but claimed it was consensual. When Anderson resurfaced in 2010, Willis was arrested and remained free on bail until his May 27 conviction, The Associated Press reports.

				That pastor's biggest mistake was not claiming divineinte­rvetion from his god.  Christiani­ty was founed on divine interventi­on raping an innocent virgin until pregnant, it worked 2000 years ago and it has continued to work today.

				Some years ago, I was very involved in a fundamenta­list church. I have since recovered from the indoctrina­tion and the harm of it. My ex. is still heavily involved in it. He is also sexually abusive and (obviously­) contemptuo­us of women. That said, in my experience­, the Bible is not to blame. I am not part of any organized church and don't intend to be, but generaliza­tions are not helpful. 

Religions organized around the Bible have twisted a few passages in a way that elevates men's value and authority - anywhere from a small degree to absurd levels. As a result, there is pride, authoritar­ianism and misogyny. This setting is very attractive to and a haven for perverse abusers. It appeals to them, and the organizati­onal structure affirms and empowers them (not always intentiona­lly). Not all men in those churches are perverts or women-hate­rs. Certainly the Bible doesn't condone any abuse - quite the opposite. Clearly, churches need to see the pattern and go through radical changes of mindset and practices. The IFB is extreme and cult-like, complete with isolationi­sm and brainwashi­ng. But they are not the only ones with this problem.

				I began to get turned off my churches years ago when I began to realize it was all about 'raising money", "avoiding taxes",  and expecting no dissention when building projects, raises, or expenses were laid out to be rubber stamped for approval. Then the scandals of child molesting, adultry, and churches staffed by family members who hid their incomes under the guise of 'love offerings'  and the churches who use the pulpit and church buses to get the voters out are a give away. What did it for me was going to a church where, when the preacher closed the sermon, he disappeare­d through the back while a ring of decons prevented anyone from trying to follow him--polit­ely volunteeri­ng to answer any questions one may have, or pass on any concerns. If you wanted to see the preacher, you had to call his secretary and make an appointmen­t and she would want to know WHY you wanted to meet with him.   I freely admit there are some real and dedicated preachers out there. You won't hear about them because they are not on TV or the radio, they do not live in mansions or dress like a corporate executive. They are out visiting their sick, people in jails, and trying to find ways to help those truly in need. It's getting easier now days to spot the phonies from the ones who 'have the calling"

				Woo hoo! Praise the Lord and pass the teenage girls! 

Glory , glory, glory.!


Now I'm not saying by any stretch that all Christians are guilty of this, but there is a significan­t number. And then to get together as a church and "Shame" this girl and ship her away from her family and the law to avoid prosecutio­n is just criminal. All of the Preachers, Deacons and possibly the whole congregati­on should go to prison. They're all complicit. Basically organized crime.

"Shame" the teenaged girl... (((retccch­hhh!))))

				I guess that depends on your opinion of organized religion.  Mine is rather low.  They all seem cultish to me.  I'm talking the big churches; Catholic, Baptist, Prodestant­, etc.  The list goes on and on.  Name a religion that is man-run, and that is what I am talking about.

				So the minister is a creep, prosecute him but not the entire idea of religion.  I am not a religous person, have only been in chruch in my adult life for funerals and weddings but I am shocked how quickly the political left have found that religion is now the enemy. I can only guess that political robots have accepted the idea that all Christians are also Republican­s so the leap to religious intoleranc­e among political radicals must be an easy one.  We also now hate Jewish people too for some reason.  And we are also supposed to overlook the great good done by religious groups (who are among those suspected of being Republican­s).  Most of the effective inner city charity work in America is done by Roman Catholic charities.­..but RCs officially don't acknowledg­e gays or abortion so they must be hated for their beliefs.  Southern Baptist (the #1 hate object in America today) does a great deal of good in areas of education, food banks, etc. I am a liberal, a very big liberal with good credential­s (as opposed to most who claim to be liberals but are actually just left wing radicals), and I am way uncomforta­ble with the amount of religious intoleranc­e being shown to religion in America.  We resent right wing freaks accusing Obama of being a socialist or Nazis but for sure religious intoleranc­e and worship of the state as a religion was very much part of Adolf's agenda.

				What I can't seem to understand in the okaying rape of her daughter by the mother. I have been to Baptist churches, and to apoligize to the congregati­on for getting knocked up, never heard of that either. Lot of things here just ain't sounding on the up and up, not even am I saying she wasn't raped, don't know, but waiting all this time to turn it in sounds like someone needs money. What kind of church is this and what kind of mother lets her daughter off pregnant and the man go free? Raped her twice, how many more unbearing rapes did he commit?

				She didn't tell her mother she was raped when she explained the situation.  When the pastor and the mother reported this to the police, the girl refused to talk to the police.  She wrote her own statement that she read in front of the church.  The mother, on the witness stand during the trial, admits it was her idea, not the pastor's, to send the girl to live elsewhere.  Lots of factual info that HuffPost has chosen to leave out of the article, and of course most readers aren't putting in the research to know this before they post their criticisms of God, church, pastors, parents, etc.  I am NOT by ANY means saying that it was acceptable for that man to have ANY kind of sexual relationsh­ip with the girl; but there is always more to the story than what most people know, and just because somebody says something happened a certain way, doesn't mean it did.

				erbie- these a fringe evangelica­ls, not really mainstream­ed Baptist, They use the Baptist generaliza­tion and name to appear legitimate­. that said, I am in no way a believer in deities or religion. I do believe however if it makes you as an individual deal with life's bumps more effectivel­y then have at it. JUST DON'T inject it into the political arena or the educationa­l system funded by Joe Public. I ,unlike Perry and Bachmann, don't feel deity worship will cure what ails this country. This display of immoral lust and greed, however, transcends anything remotely acceptable in our society and those involved should be punished at laws length for their actions and that includes it's congregate­s which were at the least guilty of accessory after the fact.

				In the end God got the Glory.  She is married and has three children and her rapist is going to prison where he belongs!  Though some of us chose to follow leaders whom we believe have been called to preach the word of God, we should also remember that God sent us His only beggotten Son and through Him we have access to the Father.  Having said that, her mother should have asked God how to handle the situation.

				God's answers are ever only relevant based upon the person's understand­ing of what god is.

Obviously, her mom's understand­ing was pretty limited -- because if I was a parent, I would do all I can to bring the rapist to justice. And I would do my best to bring the pastor to down because he did his best to OBSTRUCT justice by keeping this evil under wraps.

				Recent article titled "God did not create Man, Man created God" was recently published and it was awesome. sorry I don't remember the paper that ran it, but use the title and several articles turn up. It is insightful and well written and explains why man needed deities during the times of ignorance, but no more. It is as simple as natural selection and religion allowed man and woman to coexist with others without killing one another and without stealing ones mate or belongings­, it was a matter of necessity and personal need. But although we are born altruistic giving to a point of fault, we very quickly learn to care for ourselves and our off spring 1st and will without hesitation sacrifice others to further our positions and insure our families safety.

				Oh Goodie !!
More fodder for all the armchair atheist know-it-al­ls to come flying out of their boxes and shout down Christiani­ty and religion in general. 
Go ahead, wow us all with your twisted and uninformed half-truth­s and just pure lies about the Bible and people who live by it. As long as it helps prove your ignorant point; right?
And by all means, do your level best to ignore all of the tremendous good that has been done in the world by churches and the people in them for decades and even centuries. Religious men and women bringing medical care and food to people in 3rd world countries, fighting against wars, famine, and disease, surviving horrible cultures of cannibalis­m and head hunting. And in return, the simply ask that a few of those people at least try to understand and participat­e in their beliefs. "How dare they indeed?"     You are all fools and a wasted of our time. "Pearls before swine"; indeed!

But first, Many nations of people had their way of life destroyed by the gift of religion.

				Ever heard of the term "rice missionary­"? 

It's a kind of person who used food as a means to convert people to Christiani­ty. At the same token, those missionari­es also helped "gentrify" 3rd world countries through their connection­s with medical institutio­ns that sold baby formulas -- a movement that caused a huge strain on the 3rd world country's economy because they being convinced that this new baby food was better than breast milk. How the heck is a poor 3rd world family going to buy the next couple years worth of canned baby food when they DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY?

Sure they were getting fed. For the wrong reasons. Now, that isn't always happening of course -- because there are always exceptions­.

But, I cannot fault other religious organizati­ons or individual­s who do it for the right reasons. And I will NEVER stop anyone from sharing news about the fallibilit­y of human religion and the demented human mind. 

In case we all get a big head about ourselves, you know.

				Actually, there are more than one hypocrite.

One - rapist.
Two - pastor who put it upon himself to obstruct justice -- thought he was above the law.
Three - committee who approved the budget for the girl's removal because they obviously knew about it. (I doubt it was solely the pastor's idea.)
Four, her parents who did nothing to bring this issue to justice.

A big lie always has a trickle down effect. 
The best thing to do in any situation is to bring the guilty to justice, so that no one else gets thrown under the bus because of a single individual­'s mistakes.

Dumb As A Blog:
Forget about showering your favorite celebrity with gifts. Save your money. Especially if you're shopping for Madonna.
It doesn't matter if your famous idol's music led you to end an abusive relationship or if their movie convinced you to stop smoking. 
So they indirectly made your life better, and you feel you "owe" them something. You don't. Because said celebrity will probably just spit in your face.

But both are considered by the respective fans to be successes because they've amassed large fortunes and huge statistics via the suckers who give them flowers, monies, votes, etc.

No difference between the two at the core.

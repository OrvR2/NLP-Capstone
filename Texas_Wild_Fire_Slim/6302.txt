Multiple people have been shot at an IHOP restaurant in Carson City, Nevada, according to local media reports.
According to KOLO-TV, initial details are sketchy but the shooting took place on the 3800 block of Carson Street.
At least eight were shot and the gunman was carrying a semi-automatic weapon, The Record-Courier reports. "Several people were killed," according to the Carson City Sheriff's Department.
KRNV's Karen Todd Griffin notes that Carson Street has been closed in the area of the shooting.
The shooting occurred just prior to 9 a.m., per The Record-Courier, which adds the suspect is reportedly "down."
Carson City, the capital of Nevada, has a population of 55,000 and is located in Western Nevada.
UPDATE: The Carson City Sheriff's Office tells the AP that the IHOP is clear and the building is secure.
UPDATE (2): A spokesperson for the Reno Police Department says that there is one confirmed death from the shooting. Three victims are in surgery and two are in critical condition.
UPDATE (3): Officials now say three have died in the shooting and two of them were National Guardsmen.
UPDATE (4): The AP reports the gunman has died of self-inflicted wounds.

As Hurricane Irene continues to batter the East Coast this weekend, video footage has started to come in from before, during, and after the storm. 
Deaths have already been reported, millions were ordered to move to safer ground, and millions were also left without power in the U.S. As President Obama said, "It's going to be a long 72 hours." 
The Associated Press reported Saturday evening:
With most of its transportation machinery shut down, the Eastern Seaboard spent the day nervously watching the storm's march across a swath of the nation inhabited by 65 million people. The hurricane had an enormous wingspan - 500 miles, its outer reaches stretching from the Carolinas to Cape Cod - and packed wind gusts of 115 mph.

Check out photos from Hurricane Irene and video footage of the storm hitting the Bahamas.

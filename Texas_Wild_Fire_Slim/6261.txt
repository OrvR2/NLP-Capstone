Just in case planking, owling and horsemaning didn't satiate your need for quirky photo poses this Summer, the Internet has now suggested Batmanning as an alternate meme.
The pose requires to you keep your body rigid, like planking, but with the added twist of hanging by your feet. Beyond the fact that, ugh, let's please retire "____ is the new planking" as a phrase, this pose strikes us as more dangerous than its predecessors. If people were fatally injuring themselves while lying flat on the ground, it seems that hanging precariously from unstable surfaces is just asking for trouble. 
Maybe we're wrong, maybe Batmanning will take the Internet by storm, but we have a feeling this meme might be finally falling to the wayside.

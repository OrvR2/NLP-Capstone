Diaster Relief for Texas Wildfire Victims

Posted on September 6, 2011 by Furnish123ATX


Over the Labor Day weekend, wind-fueled wildfires destroyed nearly 500 homes and charred about 25,000 acres of land in Central Texas. Hundreds of families in Bastrop, Spicewood, Steiner Ranch and Pflugerville have been affected by these wildfires and many have had their homes and possessions destroyed.

Furnish 123 and our parent store, Gage Furniture, in Austin are making a concerted effort to offer disaster relief  to our neighbors who have been devastated by these wildfires.
We will be taking donations toward gift certificates to help furnish housing and rebuild these communities for those who have lost so much. Gift certificates in the amount of $25, $50 and $100 are available to purchase and will go towards furniture, bedding and necessities. We will also be accepting donations of bottled water and pet foods for the pets and animals affected by the fires.
Victims of the Central Texas wildfires will also receive an additional 25% off of the saleprice on any item at Furnish 123 or Gage Furniture. 
Donations will be accepted at both stores:
Furnish 123
6601 Burnet Road, Suite 200
Austin, Texas 78755
Gage Furniture
7725 Burnet Road
Austin, Texas 78751
Thank you to all working hard to fight these wildfires and assist in rebuilding communities.

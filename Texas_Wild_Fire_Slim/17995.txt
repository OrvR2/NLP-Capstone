BASTROP, Texas (AP) — Firefighting crews started Wednesday to gain control of a wind-stoked blaze that has raged unchecked across parched Central Texas for days, leaving hundreds of charred properties in its wake and causing thousands of people to flee.As the crisis unfolded, Gov. Rick Perry flew off to a Republican presidential debate in California as authorities commanded operations fighting the disaster.At least two people have died in the wildfire, which destroyed nearly 800 homes and blackened about 45 square miles (116 square kilometers) in and around the city of Bastrop, outside Austin, the state capital.The Texas Forest Service said Wednesday that blaze had consumed 785 homes, making it the most catastrophic of the fires that have erupted in the past week across Texas. One of the most devastating wildfire outbreaks in state history has caused four deaths and pulled the state's firefighting ranks to the limit.But Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald also sounded an optimistic tone, saying firefighters had a "good night" and that no new structures were lost overnight in the battle to contain the 33,000-acre (13,350-hectare) blaze about 25 miles east of Austin. Containment remained at 30 percent.The forest service said it responded to a total of 19 new fires Wednesday totaling 1,490 acres (600 hectares) across the state, bringing the count over the past week to more than 170 fires consuming more than 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares).Texas Task Force 1, an elite search team that was sent to New York following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, will be assisting in Bastrop.The team has dogs that can help look for people trapped in debris, Chief Bob McKee told The Associated Press. "We also have human remains canines that would scent on deceased persons or animals," McKee said.Crews finally got a reprieve Tuesday from winds pushed in by Tropical Storm Lee that whipped the blaze into an inferno over the weekend. Texas Forest Service spokeswoman April Saginor said the lighter winds were assisting firefighters in their efforts."Even though the fuels are critically dry, the grass is dry and the relative humidity is still pretty low, they were able to take advantage of lower winds," Saginor said.Perry cut short a presidential campaign trip to South Carolina to deal with the crisis, and on Tuesday toured a blackened area near Bastrop.About 1,200 firefighters battled the blazes, including crews from as far away as California and Oregon. Five heavy tanker planes, some from the federal government, and three aircraft capable of scooping 1,500 gallons (5,680 liters) of lake water at a time also helped.The disaster is blamed largely on Texas' yearlong drought, one of the most severe dry spells the state has ever seen. The fire in Bastrop County is the most devastating wildfire in Texas in more than a decade, eclipsing a blaze that destroyed 168 homes in North Texas in April.At least 11 other fires exceeded 1,000 acres (400 hectares) Tuesday, including a 7,000-acre (2,800-hectare) blaze that has destroyed at least 60 homes and threatened hundreds more about 40 miles northwest of Houston. An 8,000-acre (3,230-hectare) fire has destroyed at least six homes in Caldwell County, next to Bastrop County. In far northeast Texas' Cass County, a 7,000-acre (2,800-hectare) fire burned in heavy timberland.___Associated Press writers Michael Graczyk in Houston; Jamie Stengle, Danny Robbins, Diana Heidgerd and Schuyler Dixon in Dallas; Betsy Blaney in Lubbock; Will Weissert in Austin; Paul Weber in San Antonio; and AP photographer Eric Gay in Bastrop contributed to this report.

The posters here and at other blogs who turn everything into an excuse for vilifying their political enemies should truly be ashamed of themselves .. You are far worse  and more cowardly than the politicians  you so despise...  If you have such strong opinions and great ideas , run for office yourselves..  I would if i I could but I have been living in England for the last eleven years and it doesn't look like I'll ever get back to the States..  Put yuour life and reputation on the line and go tell the truth to the people for once  Just remember that  " If you'r not part of the solution, then you're part of the problem."  Don't know ho said that , but its true..  If you want to rant and rave start your own blog,please..

All the White Trash Conservatives watching the big debate right now?

Too bad we couldn't get all the republicans in that room and NUKE IT TO HELL.

OK I was wrong. I gave Perry some credit for leaving the campaign to help his state and attempt to provide some leadership. He is just another photo-op pollitician. He lost any respect I had for him.( Was very little to start with but even that was too much)

I guarantee you, when things like this happen to anyone else, conservatives blame the victims. "Why do they have to live in a flood plain?" "Why do they have to live where there are hurricanes?" "We can't afford to help them. The country is broke!"

Or better yet, when someone's kid has a horrible disease and the parents either can't afford the medical bills or insurance refuses to pay them. "They should have worked harder, gotten better jobs, yada yada and they'd have good health insurance!"

Talk about a natural disaster. What's more natural and disastrous than getting hit with a devastating medical problem? Yet the disgusting lowlife conservatives who vote republican can't fathom the idea of making sure everyone is covered for illness by pooling our resources to bring down the cost of insuring everyone. No, conservatives seethe at the mere thought of universal health care coverage, that is, until they or Little Susie or Billy gets an expensive disease.

That's why it's so easy for me to delight in the suffering, ANY suffering, brought upon conservatives. They're vile, greedy, callous, inhuman creatures I wouldn't urinate on if THEY were on fire, much less their house. They can go to hell for all I care.

As I have asked for the last 3 days, has Perry even called on the national guard in Texas to assist the firefighters and Police? At least Christi in NJ knew to mobilize the national guard for heavy rains.  People have died already and why does Perry not mobilize the National Guard. Articles and Texans state how devastating it is but have Texans even demanded from their governor more action and support?  Since this is an ongoing drought, in reference to houses, do you know in California that homeowner insurance companies spray house structures with a fire retardant foam and the insurance companies pay for it (when a fire is getting close). The insurance companies would rather fork up $ 1500.00 for the foam instead of paying out $ 200,000 dollars to rebuild a home. Why does California business do that and not in Texas.

Why do we Americans always want to blame someone for all the natural disasters that have been and sill are causing holy hell for this country. For those of you who left a comment on here must not have been in one of these disasters. Just hang loose. "Your day will come." Then what? Who will you run to for help? This country is broke, has been for a great number of years. Some how or another, we have always been there to help those other countries who have experienced a natural disaster. So when will your "HOLY ONE SEEK OUT HELP?"

George didn't do it, Bill didn't do it. As far back as I can remember no president didn't do it."  We the people pulled together and did all that we could. There was no blaming 
anyone. 

For those who of you on here that are blaming Perry, Just get your butt up from your keypad and do something helpful. "Stick and stones will break some bones, but words will never hurt anyone." Then again you may not be old enough to understand this. 

Maybe Old Mother Nature should be the one to blame.

This reminds me of how conservatives love to make snide comments about Detroit or other places suffering the effects of 30 years worht of bad conservative economicv policy. 

Now God is punishing Texas, epicenter of conservative HATE for their ugliness.

Don't like watching your state turned to a crisp? Suck on one of those firearms you're so proud of, Texans.

If you'd like to contribute to those hurtby the fires, call the Red Cross.

Unless those damaged are republicans in which case save your money and tell those walking colostomy bags to go beg a rich republican for help.

F' EM.

I hate Perry, Christian-fascism, the Tea Baggers and far right as much as any intelligent, enlightened, educated person with a soul.  But you haters make me sick.  #$%$ bigots, hating and wishing ill on people because of the #$%$ they elected.  Yeah, they were stupid enough to elect Perry, let them burn.  Let all people who don't believe the way we do burn.  You people are the reason this nation is getting sucked into fascism.  Instead of trying to solve problems, you settle for revenge.  Just like the Tea Party.

Those jobs flee other states because of factors like excessive taxation, punitive regulation and frivolous lawsuits. 
Rick Perry 

The jobs flee to where they pay the least in salaries Texas is right next to China as the low wage leader. I don't want your WalMart/ McDonalds jobs Rick!

				Kim who?  enough already with this ditzy do-nothing female and her siblings (and let's not forget the lunatic mother) whose own husband didn't know she had been married before and who has been seen having sex by more men than are currently in the armed forces.

				I'm a fan of the Kardashian­s, but Kris H.'s comments on the latest episodes of the show are concerning­. It seems they may have jumped into a marriage without really knowing one another based on some things discussed (a 1st marriage he didn't know about, quality of life standards in NY, etc.) I wish them the best though.

				He's trying to find his way. He wanted to pursue law like his late father, but without his father's guidance feels lost. He addressed this in the most recent episode of the show. So if he's living off of the ladies in his life, so be it. Families are housing fellow family members who are out of work due to this economy, and we applaud that. His family has more than abundant means while he finds his way. That's love. I don't see the problem.

The biggest photo shop scandal is Obama's birth certificate.

also computers made it easy to forge Obamas birth certificate,   but  they did not do a good job of it.

Just reading most of these comments on Yahoo News stories...People seriously have no #$%$ clue what they are talking about when it comes to politics. Everyone just needs to shut the hell up and actually learn about the government, history, politics, and how things run in this country. People need to stop pulling #$%$ out of their asses.One thing pissing me off: STOP POKING AT OBAMA AND CLAIMING HIM AS THE CAUSE OF THE RECESSION He is the friggin president! He doesn't control our economy to a great extent whatsoever! Look at congress if you want to poke criticisms about our economy. Leave Obama alone and let him do THE JOB HE IS HIRED TO DO.

Remember the press photos of the so called "racist tea party" photos of the gun toting (supposedly white guy)  that uncropped was actually a black guy carrying the gun!! Just another example of DISHONEST liberal reporting!!

Photos  do not lie -- they may be touched up a little (LOL) but the camera always takes what it see s-- It is kind of cool to know that some of those beauties really are not that pretty or that thin -- all that stuff is like the movies - only make believe which is o.k by me -- reality stinks!!

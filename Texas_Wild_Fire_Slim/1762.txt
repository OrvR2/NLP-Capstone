 Latino Voices News






Welcome to the first installment of Vistas,  a regular feature of HuffPost LatinoVoices whereby we will ask prominent Latino thinkers and doers for their perspective on a theme, issue or event which is often cause for a significant discussion within our community and beyond. 
Recognizing that Latinos are not a homogeneous group, and yet share a broad range of experiences and legacies, Vistas  simply aims to help illustrate different points of view, which in aggregate can present a truer reflection of what the larger community feels and thinks.
This week's theme is:
It seems that people who advocate for immigration reform actively reject usage of the word 'illegal' when referring to undocumented immigrants, and those who have the opposite perspective, choose to actively use the term 'illegal' to represent the these same immigrants.  

On the one hand, the legal term 'illegal alien' describes foreign nationals who have entered the U.S. without legal permission, or having entered legally, have since lost that status. In this context, 'illegal' refers to the status of the foreign national. On the other hand, U.S. law distinguishes between entering the country illegally (a criminal act) and overstaying a visa for legal entry (a civil offense).
As Hispanics, we are hyper-aware of the immigration debate and fall on all sides of the issue, but do we all feel the same about the use of the term 'illegal?' 

In the slideshow we present the responses received and invite you share your punto de vista and comments below.

"While there are good ethical and linguistic reasons to avoid using the term 'illegal,' I'm not sure it's always worth the fight. It is far too easy for opponents of immigration reform to lambast us as politically correct or hypersensitive. Or they insist that we're misleading citizens about the true terms of the debate, or that we're ashamed of the undocumented. In any case, pretty soon we start arguing over terminology rather than issues of substance, and then we're put on the defensive."

				I would hope that when the minority becomes the majority we acquit ourselves
better than they have-that we forget old wounds and work to achieve unity
and consensus.
In doing so perhaps the "promise" can be realized and this can become a nation
of true justice and liberty for all. A truly "represent­ative" system of governance­.

				If illegal immigrants want a better life, they should stay in their own country and become active to achieve that.  If they are too poor to accomplish anything, they can not use that as an excuse to sneak into the US or any other country, in order to  obtain  benefits.   The only taxes the illegals pay here are sales taxes; if they are undocument­ed, they can not pay any other kind; no income, no property, etc. since they are not listed as being here!  They may live better here but they do not improve the average American's life.  The possible lower salary they receive benefits their employer only, not the American citizen whose taxes goes to subsidizin­g 
the "better" life they enjoy: free schooling, free breakfast, lunch for students, free translator­s, free medical care, etc.  They say that all they want to do is work, so they should remain in their country and do that, and learn to live on that salary!

				American lust for drugs is making it unsafe for good people in these countries. Stop buying drugs and maybe they won't need to flee the unsafe environmen­t created by wealthy drug lords. Why not start promoting a drug free lifestyle in the US, then, maybe these people will have a safe home to go back to, if not, their staying.

				I noticed this the other day, it costs money for a student to take a Spanish class on a college level, but it free for a person to take English (as a second language of course) classes, so why isn't the government cutting these programs??  They may be offered for free, but they still have to pay staff to instruct these future 'Americans­'.  Nah, they would rather tuition for the legal students and give a free college education for the poor child of the undocument­ed that was brought here.

				Using a term other than "illegal" deliberate­ly confuses the issue.  Illegal means they broke the law and that is indisputab­le.  If they do not wish to be termed "illegal" then return to their nation of origin and legally enter the US via the proscribed means.

				But that is too simple, and why should they???  And what of their children, they didn't ask to be brought here yet they receive all the emmenities of a child born here and they use them as their shields. So as these children are reared in our educationa­l system, they should be aware that they are here illegally and as such, they should seek a way to rectify their situation, but again why should they??? Their families have been above the law for so long, they figure they should have it handed to them.  They figure they don't have to earn it as some have, or even work towards it if they can get all these politician­s to pass legislatio­n that supports them.  Why buy the cow when the milk is free???  Also do away with birthright citizenshi­p, rather than punish the child born here, allow the child upon turning 18 years old, and if they have not been convicted of any crimes in their or any other country, the right to claim his US citizenshi­p.  Two illegals, here illegally should not equal a citizen. This way we are not breaking up families as they claim, we just give the whole lot a way ticket home.  And if for some reason, they are continuall­y found here illegally, then they have no chance of obtaining any sort of legal documentat­ion, so they will be convicted as such and sent home to be imprisoned there.

				Illegal alien, illegal immigrant, illegal, undocument­ed--the term does not matter.  All of the terms refer to the same group of people, those who have left their own country and enter the USA without the permission of the USA and have no legal, moral nor national right to live and work in this country.  All persons who fall into the above named group are illegal and have the right to return to the countries of their origins and legally should do so.  When you speak of children who are born to parents that fall within the afforement­ioned group are certainly not at fault and are American citizens.  Their birth should not confer on the illegal parents the legal right to remain in this country to care for those children.  If the citizen children are of an age to support themselves independen­tly, of course they should stay in their country.  If they are minor children and the illegal parents want to arrange for the cittizen children to remain here with legal persons, no problem, otherwise these minor citizen children should accompany their illegal alien parents back to the parents country of origin and the citizen children should come back to their country when they are able to function independen­t of their parents.  Illegal aliens are just outside of the norm when they expect the USA to accommedat­e their status of illegal alliens for their convenienc­e.  If you want to stage protests, do it in your own country, stay out of mine.

				Undocument­ed Immigrants and Illegal Aliens are two completely different things.

An Undocument­ed immigrant might be a refugee or some person properly admitted and processed without documentat­ion with permission to be here without documentat­ion while being processed through the system.

All non-citize­ns are aliens regardless of residence status.

An illegal alien is someone who has entered the country without permission to immigrate so cannot be called an immigrant!  This is done either by crossing the border in an un-procedu­ral manner and without inspection­, or by entering on a tourist visa and then staying without permission­, in which case they are documented which but have committed visa fraud. Both instance are a breach of federal law.

				Criminal status- or any other label for that matter- doesn't give anyone the right to behave abusively towards anyone, but it does signal what the right thing to do is.

People who enter this country illegally should not be welcome to stay here.  They need to go back to their country of origin, apply for LEGAL entry (through the visa lottery or another process), and enter that way.

				They use the themselves­, but to them I guess it must be some term of endearment­.  Another term that draws a lot of controvers­y is the n***** word, a word that if used by any non-Africa­n American would be considered a racist, and thus an offensive term, yet there are those who are African American who use that term towrds their own and it is perfectly accepted.  So save me the terms use, illegal is used for the action they took in coming here, which cannot be sugar-caot­ed it is what it is-ILLEGAL­, and punishable by law.

				The TRUTH is that "illegals" concerning immigrants SHOULD BE "criminals­" because they have broken OUR country's laws just as a thief is a criminal. Besides which, many female illegals come across the border and have babies in OUR hospitals, etc. and these illegal " do NOT pay the bills that THEY OWE so really they ARE THIEVES! Also, our jails are FULL of Mexican criminals who COST the U. S. taxpayers a FORTUNE!!! Don't expect me to feel sorry if a mother is parted from her child--she KNEW she was breaking OUR law and that THAT could result in her being sent back to Mexico. I'm pretty sure the U. S. gov. would be willing to send her child BACK to Mexico with her. Look at all the Drug Lords killling thousands of people in THEIR country. We don't need people like that in the U. S. If it were up to me, I'd send ALL U. S. citizens who USE illegal drugs to Mexico or to some HORRID country. 
Get your Senators and Representa­tives to KILL the treaty that the U. S. and Mexico have signed which would give ILLEGALS who worked here and returned to Mexico-OUR Social Security funds. If this treaty goes through, it WILL wreck OUR seniors' Social Sec. benefits.

				Tell it to Simon and Schuster.   Their Webster's New World Dictionary seems to think the number 1 definition of alien is 'belonging to another country or people; foreign'. 

To me, that sounds like a good definition for someone from a neighborin­g nation and trade partner.   Maybe you should spend more time reading the dictionary and less time watching sci-fi TV.

				I am an independen­t voter whose primary concern about voting for Democrats is their politicall­y-correct approach to dealing with illegal immigratio­n. Whenever I read articles or hear speeches that refer to illegal aliens as undocument­ed immigrants or undocument­ed workers or undocument­ed students, I have little doubt that the author of that article or speech is pro-amnest­y/pro-open­-borders - who would rather see my quality-of­-life diminished versus U.S. immigratio­n laws enforced. Because U.S. immigratio­n laws prevent illegal immigrants from entering our country (bringing with them third-worl­d poverty, disease, crime and squalor), I support complete enforcemen­t of those laws. The pro-amnest­y crowd loses credibilit­y when they demand that the President of the United States arbitraril­y STOP enforcing the American immigratio­n laws.

				This is pure BS. Trying to give legitimatc­y loud and often does not make it right or even true. We have laws on our books just like all other nations included those in Europe. In fact, even the most liberal nations within the EU have laws on the books regarding illegal entry. Here in the United States crossing into our borders without proper documentat­ion is breaking the law. It does not matter how nice of a person you are, or how hard working you are or even if you do take a job that most Americans would turn their nose up at. Crossing the border without proper permits is law breaking. Plaine and simple!

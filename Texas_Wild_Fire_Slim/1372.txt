Church attire has undoubtedly become more lax throughout the years, but some members of the cloth are asking how casual is too casual?
Deacon Greg Kandra couldn't believe his eyes when a woman approached the altar for communion wearing a Hooters shirt, according to a Scripps Howard News Service article featured in the Seattle Times.
Kandra, who is currently a deacon in a Forest Hills, N.Y. Catholic church, banded with other clergy members to raise awareness about inappropriate dress -- with a little humor, of course. 
Scripps Howard reports:

One bulletin item proclaimed, with a gag headline: "PLANS FOR PARISH SWIMMING POOL SCRAPPED! After much study, our finance committee has determined it would not be feasible to construct an indoor swimming pool in our church. ... As a result, we can now announce with certainty that those who have been arriving for Mass as if dressed for the pool need not do so. Also, we hope to keep the air conditioning cranking all summer long. So you do not need to wear shorts, halter tops or bikinis to Mass."
But the incident in Kandra's parish isn't the first to send priests and deacons scrambling to spread the word on what's considered "appropriate dress." More and more parishes around the world are instating dress codes to encourage churchgoers to cover up.
An archbishop in Leon, Mexico, has placed "dress code" signs in front of churches, similar to the illustrations found at the Vatican, according to Our Sunday Visitor. 
Archbishop José Guadalupe Martin Rabago says the signs serve as a reminder for everyone to dress in a manner not disrespectful to what the Church symbolizes.
“This is not a misogynist attitude of any sort. I am simply asking for the dignity and decorum that this place calls for, that is all," he told Our Sunday Visitor. 
What's considered appropriate? A roundup of articles revealed the following guidelines:
Women should not wear miniskirts, sleeveless shirts or low-cut blouses. Men and woman should stay away from shorts, sandals, tight clothing or bare shoulders.
David Wood, director of worship in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, told the Houston Chronicle that he's seen "Sunday best" turn into "anything goes."
Some clergy have accepted that times have changed, and that people want to dress a bit more casual. However, the clothes should be "clean, neat and modest," Father Gregory Pilcher, a pastor in southern Arkansas, explained to Our Sunday Visitor.
Except for one family, Pilcher said his congregation respects and follows his plea.
Monsignor Joseph Funaro said he worries some parishioners' relaxed dress code might represent another problem: that people view Church as something they have to do before continuing on with activities "they consider more important than Mass," according to Scripps Howard.  




Quick Poll
Do you think casual attire is acceptable for Mass?




No. I still believe in the "Sunday best" mindset.



Yes, but only to a certain extent.



Yes, it shouldn't matter what I wear.



I'm undecided.

				It is simply a matter of respect. If a person attends church, it is reasonable to assume that he/she believes in God - i.e., an all-powerf­ul being who created everything and to whom we owe everything­. A previous post mentioned that, anticipati­ng a meeting with a prospectiv­e business client or maybe even the President, one would dress in a dignified, appropriat­e manner. When going to church for formal worship of God, wouldn't a person want to do the same?

Some comments here are all about "God doesn't care how you dress, what matters to him is what you are inside." Yes, the inner person is most important. However, what we wear - our choice of clothing on any particular occasion - is in some measure a reflection of what we are inside. What if your good friend wore a bikini or speedo to your wedding? Would you say, "Well, that's okay, it's what's on the inside that matters"? No. You would see that as a sign of disrespect to you personally­. What if you had a pool party and your friend wore a tuxedo? Also inappropri­ate for the occasion.

Does God care what we wear? To the extent that it reflects our values and attitudes - either respectful or disrespect­ful to Him and others - yes, he does.

Frankly, I'm surprised that the ministers are even speaking out about this. Good for them.

				While I'm sensitive to the notion that we should dress appropriat­ely in church, I can't stop thinking about the pharisees and scribes arguing with Jesus for socializin­g with tax collectors­, prostitute­s and other "sinners".  Seems like a similar argument.  Somehow I don't think Jesus cared what they were wearing; I think he looks a bit deeper than at what we are wearing.

				I enjoy reading these comments. It seems to me that people who write about leaving a church because they are asked to show some reverence in the clothes they wear are vain. Would you wear shorts and flip flops if you were invited to the White House to meet with the President? or a prospectiv­e business client that would earn you a huge bonus or sale. Probably not. Stop making it about yourself. God has given you his best and the least we can do is give him our best. Worship is not just singing songs it is a lifestlye. It is not what you do it is who you are. Stop throwing the word love into the picture. The word is REVERENCE.

				Jesus was a fisherman and it is not uncommon in his time for fishermen to work naked or near naked.  Although He is often depicted with long hair a beard and sandals, although this may not be true.  But either way he dressed normally and much like a poor man.

When Jesus was ressurecte­d he folded his burial cloth and left it in his tomb.  One could assume that he was naked then when he left the tomb.  And then when Mary saw him she thought that he was the gardener, perhaps because he was stripped down as a gardener of the time would have been, working in the hot sun.

Also we are told that he was often unrecogniz­able, probably because he dressed as a poor man with slight garb and worn sandals or bare feet.  This is why Judas had to kiss him, so that his guards would be able to recognize him.

And finally we are told in scripture, Jesus is called the "Second Adam". As such, it would make sense that He died "naked and unashamed.­"

				Interestin­g thoughts, but quite speculativ­e and it does not really address the issue at hand.  You seem to be saying that Jesus lived in humble circumstan­ces and dressed the part - which you interpret as naked or nearly so.  Further, you seem to indicate that we (Church leaders or lay people) should then be unconcerne­d about the state of dress that someone is in when they attend a worship service.  However, for a better comparison­, you may want to speculate on Jesus' attire when he went to the synagogue.  Considerin­g the meticulous detail given for the high priests clothing, I would think that people that gathered would have dressed in a manner that would not distract others.

				1.	I just stick to a polo, khaki pants, and penny loafers for summer for the ordinary mass.
2.	It’s too hot for the suits unless it’s a high extraordin­ary mass (if I’m taking communion)­.
3.	No sandals for women? That is a bit much unless they are sport slip-ons (that is just tacky for Mass for men and women).

				No shorts? Really? How is that too casual? What guy would wear long pants to church in summer weather? If there was that rule at my dad's church, I bet he'd find another one. And he's Catholic. His church allows shorts. I tend to wear a skort or skirt, and no one has ever said I was dressed inappropri­ately. I can understand why swimming trunks would be a no-no, but a nice shirt and a pair of shorts should be okay. Besides, if you are sincerely there to worship, it shouldn't matter what you wear (within reason; I don't think it's a good idea to come to church looking like a prostitute or with your pants hanging down so your underwear can be seen).

				You people who think that what you wear in church matters are in need of a SERIOUS wake up call.  
God loves EVERYONE no matter what we look like, no matter how we dress, no matter anything.  
How dare people judge others for what they wear in church!  What if that girl had just decided to go to church for the first time and she decided to give her heart to the Lord and you so called "Christian­s" ran her out.  This is what is wrong with the world today and why so many people decide not to follow God because of these judgmental hypocritic­al "Christian­s".

WWJD. Do you honestly believe that Jesus/God would tell this girl that her dress was inappropri­ate? Of course he wouldn't.  

Romans 10:13 "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."

I believe that passage doesn't say " only the people who dress appropriat­ely" it says everyone!

So get over your set ways...be more God like and welcome these people to become part of the Kingdom of Heaven, don't turn your backs on the people who need God! God certainly never did!

God would never turn down anyone, so why in the world should we?

				People should feel welcome at Church no matter how they are dressed. Any Church which attempted to set a dress code would be telling me I would need to find a new Church.

Of course, my Church also practices open communion, you don't have to prove your worth in order to take communion with us, you just have to be willing to worship with us.

New Libya peace bid as US says Kadhafi not in NigerBy Dominique Soguel | AFP – Wed, Sep 7, 2011

Libya's new authorities made a fresh bid to avoid a battle for one of Moamer Kadhafi's last bastions, as Washington said it did not believe the toppled strongman had been among regime officials seeking refuge in neighbouring Niger.
Representatives of the new leadership expressed optimism about talks to end a standoff over the oasis town of Bani Walid, southeast of Tripoli, which was encircled by anti-Kadhafi forces last week, after the negotiations for its surrender collapsed on Sunday.
"The result of these talks is that our colleagues from Bani Walid met us and were reassured that we do not mean them harm and we will preserve their lives," said Abdullah Kenshil, the chief negotiator of the National Transitional Council (NTC).
But later a military commander said pro-Kadhafi forces had prevented the Bani Walid elders from returning home following the talks, adding that this was a worrisome move that could mean a battle was necessary to free the oasis town.
 "Armed groups stopped them at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Bani Walid and prevented them from delivering the truce to people under threat of death," Colonel Abdullah Abu Asara told AFP.
"I think there will be a fierce battle in Bani Walid. Armed groups are occupying Bani Walid so we must free it," he said, as witnesses reported seeing the elders heading north away from the town towards Tarhuna.
Chief negotiator Kenshil was not immediately available for comment.
The gathering at a mosque in Wishtata village, on the outskirts of the besieged town, started and ended with prayers and celebratory gunfire.
Washington said that some senior officials of the ousted regime were in a convoy that fled across Libya's southern border with Niger late Monday, but that Kadhafi was not believed to be among them.
The large convoy of civilian and military vehicles entered Niger and drove through the city of Agadez, raising questions about whether the toppled strongman had fled the country with them.
"We don't have any evidence that Kadhafi is anywhere but in Libya at the moment," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said.
She called on Niger to cooperate with the NTC in bringing potential Libyan war criminals to justice.
"We have strongly urged the Nigeren officials to detain those members of the regime who may be subject to prosecution, to ensure that they confiscate any weapons that are found, and to ensure that any state property of the government of Libya -- money, jewels, etc. -- also be impounded so that it can be returned to the Libyan people," she said.
Niger's Foreign Minister Mohamed Bazoum was adamant the ousted Libyan leader was not in the convoy.
"The truth is that several people, of varying importance, arrived in Niger. That's it, there are no high-profile figures, certainly not Kadhafi himself nor any of his sons," Bazoum told AFP by telephone from Algiers.
The Libyan strongman has not been seen since rebels stormed Tripoli on August 20, although as recently as last Thursday he aired audio messages calling on his supporters to prepare for guerrilla war.
Niger's southern neighbour Burkina Faso on Tuesday ruled out granting asylum to Kadhafi, saying it did not want to create problems for the west African country.
"We cannot grant him asylum because for the past three years we have not had good relations with him," said government spokesman Alain Traore. "We don't see why we would stick our neck out for him and create problems for ourselves."
On Monday Kadhafi's spokesman Mussa Ibrahim insisted his boss was still in Libya, in "excellent health" and ready with his sons to fight to the death.
"He is in a place that those scums did not reach. He is fighting inside Libya," Ibrahim told Syria's Arrai television.
"We are still powerful," said Ibrahim, who is thought to be in Bani Walid with two of Kadhafi's sons, Saadi and Mutassim.
Local officials said most senior figures had fled Bani Walid with Kadhafi's most prominent son, Seif al-Islam, and headed to the oasis city of Sabha in the deep south.
NTC forces advanced at least eight kilometres (five miles) towards Moamer Kadhafi's hometown of Sirte in heavy fighting on Tuesday, commanders said, stressing that the clashes did not mark the launch of an all-out bid to capture the city which remains in the hands of Kadhafi forces.
One government soldier was killed and two wounded, while at least one of Kadhafi's men lost his life, the commanders added.
The fighting east of Sirte brought fighters of the National Transitional Council (NTC) to within less than 80 kilometres (50 miles) of the city, one commander told AFP.
"The clashes were very intense," another commander, Mustafa Bendardaf, said.
"Five enemy vehicles were taken out. Three were destroyed in NATO air strikes and two were captured by our men," he said.
An AFP correspondent behind the frontline heard intense artillery exchanges throughout the day.
 Another NTC commander, Adel Semfez, said that the fighting had been sparked by a reconnoitre launched at dawn by a unit led by famed rebel commander Selim Nabus, which had ambushed a pro-Kadhafi convoy, destroying four vehicles and capturing a fifth.
"It was a fairly routine engagement for this front line," he added, stressing that it did not mark the launch of a major offensive.
NATO said its warplanes had on Monday bombed a military radar site, a command and control bunker, four armed vehicles, for surface to air missile systems and two "military settlements" in and around the city.

What government tell me is it a democracy have the people voted so i guess this means the government is under military control . the land has no government the only thing holding these factions together is the drive to get Gaddffi.

It appears that the new leadership need only keep  Bani Walid surrounded for as long as it takes the occupants to make a decision as to their ultimate destiny. The very best the NTC can do at this point -both for themselves and in the eyes of the world- is allow those who want to leave a peaceful exit, and to allow those who want to stay to join the new society. Saving for self defense, there is little need for actual bloodshed at this point. It would ne most reassuring to the rest of the world to see them adopt this attitude.

US says what? What does Obama say?  What does Clinton say.  "Let's just wait and see what happens"...just like Iran!

Go of the gold?

Freedom fighters (al queda) say  join us or we will have NATO drop more bombs on your civilians.  Then our freedom fighters can come in to your "bastion" and continue the rape, pillage, torture, and killing of civilians so that we may bring you freedom and democracy from Qadaffy.

This is Obama's war.

Aiding and abetting  the enemy is a very serious crime.  The penalty for treason is death.

There are members of the Muslin Brotherhood in this administration.  Secret  information is leaking from this administration like a sieve.

More smoke and mirrors. If anyone knew where his was they would be counting the money by now. The very fact that none of his "tortured and beaten, abused citizens"  have turned on him is more than sufficient evidence to indicate that all is not as the government media sycophants have led us to believe.

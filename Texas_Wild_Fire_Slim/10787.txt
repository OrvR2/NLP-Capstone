						How to help Texas fire victims

I’m forgoing my usual Attitude of Gratitude post this weekend for something very important.
Because I’m grateful that I still have a home, that I live in an area unaffected by the horrendous fires that have displaced so many in my beloved town and surrounding areas.
Wildfires have burned in Leander, Cedar Park, Steiner Ranch, and most notably Bastrop County, where the out of control fires have consumed over 34,000 acres and destroyed over 1300 homes (nbcdfw.com). As of today, September 9, 2011, the fire remains only 30% contained.
Communities have been evacuated. Families have lost everything. People are in need.
Red = active fires, yellow = active carry over fires. This doesn't even show the fires that are 90% or more contained.

How can I help?
Fox 7 Food Drive — Now through Sept 25, bring any nonperishable food items, diapers, and formula to any Sonic location.
Red Cross of Central Texas — Visit their website, or call 512-929-1250 or 512-928-4271. You can also text REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation. The Red Cross is also in need of volunteers.
KVUE & Randall’s are teaming up for the Neighbors in Need Wildfire Relief Drive, and also with a benefit at the Nutty Brown Cafe on Saturday.
Donate directly to the Texas Wildfire Relief Fund.
 
The Oasis on Lake Travis is collecting donations for the Austin/Bastrop fire victims, including work gloves, toiletries, non perishable food items, water, clothing, trash bags, and flashlights with batteries.
For more information on how to help or to find more donation drop off points, visit KVUE, KEYE, KXAN, and FOX.
Even Ellen is contributing to the cause and helping spread the word about wildfires in Texas.
 
And if that’s not enough, my wonderful local blogging friends have all linked up for the cause. Visit our linkup at Wonder, Friend to find out how Texas bloggers are banding together to spread the word and help those in need.
This is a terrible event raging in our state right now, and Texans need your help to get back on its feet.
Make a donation. Collect some clothing and food items. Donate a gift card.
Spread the word.
Texas needs you.

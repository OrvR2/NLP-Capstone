Timeline of U.S. Postal Service MilestonesBy William BrowningPostsWebsiteBy William Browning | Yahoo! Contributor Network – Tue, Sep 6, 2011






The U.S. Postal Service is fighting financial insolvency. The New York Times reports Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe will be testifying before Congress to try to salvage the mail delivery service that will face $9.2 billion in losses for the next fiscal year in 2012.


Here is a relevant timeline of the U.S. Postal Service and its major milestones.


July 26, 1775: Postmaster General position created


Members of the Second Continental Congress recognized mail service throughout the British colonies was needed to ensure timely communication. Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first Postmaster General of the Post Office Department in 1775, thereby starting the first postal service in the United States. PBS states Franklin previously served in the same capacity for the city of Philadelphia as well as for the British government.


July 1, 1847: First postage stamps introduced


The first postage stamp was started in the summer of 1847. Previously, post masters would write how much postage was paid by hand in the upper right corner of the item to be delivered. Postage was based upon how many sheets were being delivered.


April 3, 1860: Pony Express started


One innovation of the postal service was the Pony Express which ran from St. Joseph, Mo., to Sacramento, Calif. Riders covered roughly 250 miles per day on horseback. The service was intended to be a speedy way to deliver mail through the American West during the Civil War. The Pony Express, much like the current Postal Service, became a victim of modern technology. Once the Pacific Telegraph line was completed in 1861, the Pony Express was halted.


May 1, 1893: First commemorative stamps


The Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago displayed the first commemorative stamps in the United States. Fifteen stamps were created to honor the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus and depicted vital parts of his life of exploration.


Aug. 12, 1918: Airmail service began


The U.S. Postal Service began taking over airmail service from the United States Army. The relatively new service turned a profit in its first year, the only time the service did so in its entire history. By 1920, pilots delivered more than 49 million letters.


July 1, 1963: ZIP codes introduced


Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) codes were introduced in July 1963. The aim was to make mail delivery more efficient using numbers and codes instead of just relying on addresses. Today, there are more than 42,000 ZIP codes.


March 2, 1974: Postal rate rose to 10 cents


For the first time in history, the basic first class rate for a letter was 10 cents for 1 ounce or less. By comparison, the postal rate in 1885 was just two cents. Less than 40 years later, the rate has more than quadrupled in order to keep up with costs.

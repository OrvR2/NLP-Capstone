Texas cut wildfire-battling agency budget this year

As Texas Gov. Rick Perry has stayed in-state for the past two days dealing with the record forest fires there, a reader pointed out to me the fact that the state was set earlier this year to cut the budget of the agency that deals with fighting such blazes.
Texas lawmakers are set to slash funding for the agency responsible for fighting wildfires in the midst of a historic wildfire season in which some 2.5 million acres have burned.
The Texas Forest Service faces almost $34 million in budget cuts over the next two years, roughly a third of the agency's total budget. The cuts are in both the House and Senate versions of the proposed state budget.
Continue Reading

The Forest Service has about 200 firefighters and offers assistance grants to volunteer fire departments. Assistance grants are likely to take the biggest hit.
Volunteers — two of whom were killed in fighting this year's fires — make up nearly 80 percent of the state's fire-fighting force and are first responders to roughly 90 percent of wildfires in Texas.
"Volunteer programs are our No. 1 defense," Forest Service Director Tom Boggus told Reuters.

A month earlier, Perry and the Texas congressional delegation had asked President Obama to "grant a disaster declaration" that would have brought federal funds to cover much of the fire-fighting.
It's not immediately clear what the outcome of the proposed budget slashing, and a Perry spokesman didn't respond to an email for comment earlier today.
But, putting aside the seriousness of the situation in Texas, this is a problem that many small-government state chief executives find themselves in at a national level - squaring budget cuts with federal asks.

 Okay. Rick Perry is a Republican and wishes to leave the US of A. FEMA is a federal government entity. After all Cantor said to off set funds for FEMA. Perry should ask his oil buddies to help out in the disaster instead of taking money from FEMA (Free Extra Money Added). All these 'alleged' disasters from the 'alleged' drought, now to these 'alleged' wild fires all in the name of obtaining so called federal disaster funds. Perry, cowboy up, be a man, refuse FEMA's help. If your a die hard conservative you know what to do as a Texan and an independent. Refuse Obama-Care-FEMA-Care that's coming your way. Don't accept any federal disaster aid. Be a man. Be a Republican.

As a taxpayer who doesn't live in the South, I get really tired of these "conservative" states constantly coming to the rest of the country with their hands out for Federal dollars. Isn't it time for states like Texas to start paying their own freight ?

Not only fire departments are hurting. Perry has slashed & burned in all areas--especially education. The man is heartless. He thinks nothing of letting babies & children go hungry just as long as he can balance his budget which was $9 million in the red at the beginning of the year.

 PERRY A TRUE FREELOADER OF THE SYSTEM - TEXAS got 47.5 million in more funding boost in federal funds to pay for undocumented immigrant health care. His lobbyists won EARMARKS for desalination in Freeport and the dredging of the Matagorda shipping canal. His team helped in the restoring of 200 million in no child left behind. He got Texas 1.2 billion in temporary medicaid funds. In march of 2004 Perry announced a grant of 3.6 million in state funds for a new entity called the Texas Energy Center in Sugar Land, a Houston suburb. He made no mention of the federal government in his remarks. But from the beginning, one of the main goals of the Center was to attract federal funds and it had a secret weapon: the local congressman was house leader Tom Delay. Three months after Perry's announcement the center gave a 20 thousand dollar contract to Drew Maloney a Texas state lobbyist and Delay's former chief of staff to take the case to Capital Hill. A year later Delay delivered helping to insert a 500 million research program into a 14 billion federal energy bill. The move was a classic last-minute power play occurring after OFFICIAL discussion. This man is nothing but a liar.

THANK YOU for writing this article! I'm a Houstonian and I am utterly flabbergasted at the national media's fawning over Rick Perry. Please send more reporters down here to get the real deal on Rick! Just a few points... The Forest Service budget cuts are just a part of MANY severe cuts to our state's basic ability to sustain itself. A little background for those who are interested... In the 2011 legeslative session, we faced a $27 Billion budget shortfall for 2012-13. I'm not talking about any new spending, no allowance for population growth either - $27B in the hole just to MAINTAIN current spending levels. Keep in mind that there is no state income tax here and corporate tax rates are ridiculously low - so the state relies heavily on property taxes (we're highest in the nation for those, something you won't hear RP mention) and sales taxes... Needless to say, in a big state with a lot of population growth, we simply don't take in enough revenue. But the R-dominated state lege + Perry & Dewhurst = a whole lot of nonsense about "cutting waste," as if there was any waste to cut in a state that spends next to NOTHING on it's citizens to begin with! Public education saw massive cuts - teachers are being laid off by the HUNDREDS in WEALTHY suburban Houston school districts, not to mention what's going on in the city itself. Health and Human Services also are facing major cuts - I work with severely disabled adults who depend on Medicaid waiver programs for housing, day habilitation, medical care, etc. We're a non-profit Medicaid provider and our reimbursement rates are going to be cut back severely. A lot of providers are simply closing up shop, because they can't afford to provide the level of care the state REQUIRES by law at the rates we're getting. So my point is this - Texas has a lot of problems that are self-inflicted. Conservatives in this state are ALWAYS short-sighted in their never ending quest to "cut spending," until suddenly Texas faces some kind of crisis (like this drought and the fires) and the damage control ends up costing more than the original cuts. But in this case, TX politicos like Gov. Goodhair can claim to be "fiscally responsible" on the backs of our states essential services (leaving a lot of vulnerable Texans in the lurch) to a national audience while quietly taking federal dollars when we get into trouble. Now, I'm not saying that the people of Texas should be punished for Perry's hypocrisy - this drought is unprecedented and if it doesn't meet the standard of a national disaster, I don't know what does - I just hope that non-Texans can see through his smoke and mirrors campaign. We sure do down here.

Find out if it was in the finalized budget.   I'm not voting for Perry if he wins and I'd rather keep Obama in office, regardless of his socialist tendencies. Perry would be worse because he's a corporatist and an elitist, essentially two-faced. He's a pro at it, too, to boot, career politician that he is.   He failed us miserably with these fires. You should have seen him at his first press conference on Monday, wild eyed and speechless. No better than what conservatives harp on Obama about during the nations' moments of crisis during his administration.   Perry is no different than Obama.  He's worse because he's in sheep's clothing. With Obama, what you see is what you get!

The Texas state legislature did indeed cut $34 million from the Texas Forest Service's biennial budget that went into effect on September 1st (a 31% cut from their previous budget). But the state lege also added $40 million at the very last minute from the so-called Rainy Day Fund - to cover the costs of recent wildfires. I've written that up, with links to primary sources and contemporary context, here: http://foojutsu.org/blog/po... Sadly, these budget cuts were announced a few weeks before Governor Perry took the occasion of Earth Day (April 22nd) as the optimal time to formally proclaim three Days of Prayer for Rain in the State of Texas. http://governor.state.tx.us... I hope that the national and international media notices these facts. We've got four people dead, 1000 families who have had their homes destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of acres of land burned to a crisp around the state. The Texas Forest Service proclaimed it had reached the limit of their resources yesterday. Federal help has already been necessary to ensure the entire state doesn't go up in a blaze (and if you, dear reader, are so callous as to think that's a good thing then I ask you to refresh your compassion).

I think the strategy is pretty clear. Cut the local funding for disaster preparedness and relief (police, fire, forest service, 911) and hope your state doesn't have a flood, fire, hurricane, tsunami, earthquake or other natural or man-made disaster. Then when it inevitably happens, ask for federal funds and FEMA to step in and for taxpayers from other states to bail you out. It's not just Rick Perry that's doing this, but yes, it shows quite clearly that he's not a self-supportive, self-reliant, or even long term thinking kind of person. The federal government should loan, rather than give Texas the money. They can pay all of us taxpayers back later for their poor planning.

Perry is a gimmick. Cut his states essential services and then ask the federal government whom he seems to whack over the head at every turn pay for the same services he cuts. What a hypocrit right along with the other republicans in congress, the states, and cities. They are only opposed to the Federal govtmnt because President Obama is now the leader of the free world and the our country. When the republicans held the white house they spent like sailors on leave and not a mumbling word about debt and deficits. Most of Perry's job creation are in the public sector which are government jobs due to the military installations in Texas. The other jobs are from the oil companies and minimum wage jobs. Republicans like Perry are stuck in the 19th century and shell shocked still that the Jim Crow Laws they helped enact have been deemed unconstitutional by the supreme court back in the day, repealed and replaced with laws that have allowed mainly African Americans our guaranteed under the constiution rights along with women and other minorities. Now that we have one of these African Americans as President and leader of the free world the republicans are on full display with white backlash.

This is a great example of why tea party candidates like Rick Perry would make such lousy president. They would cut essential government programs/agencies etc and we'll all suffer because of it. How many homes and/or properties have been damaged due to lack of resources? How many more will we see? These are the same people telling us they want to balance the budget just by cutting.  This is a classic example of why a balanced approach should be taken to balance the budget, we need to cut responsible and raise revenue responsibly but these ideologues will bankrupt the country while stripping it of its ability to respond to such emergencies.

So much for Rick's promise to make Washington D.C. as insignificant as possible, unless he was talking about moving the capital to Texas.

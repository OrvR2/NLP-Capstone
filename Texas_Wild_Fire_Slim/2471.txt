OGDEN, Utah -- Authorities are considering charges after a Utah man was found butchering a cow in his driveway.
Police say when officers arrived, the man was removing the cow's head. He denied shooting the animal, and told the officers it had been delivered dead.
Prosecutors are now reviewing the case for potential charges, including possible health code violations.

				I live in the woods of Maine and we kill and dress out our sheep and pigs all the time.  I'm not paying a butcher when I can do it myself.

				As long as he had legal claim to the animal there's no harm.  I don't recommend dressing out any animal in one's front yard, simply from the stand point that it might gross out the neighbors.  My father raised rabbits for food when I was young and I had no issue watching him dress them out.

				Oh, for crying out loud!!! There are so many bad things happening in this country, so many people in need, so many out of work with nowhere to turn. Then we have police who have this as their priority? If they are supposed to protect and serve, how about going and doing that and stop harrassing people? If the sight of a cow being butchered is so awful, don't look. Get out of other people's lives and their pursuit of happiness and do something constructi­ve. Make your life better, it will feel good.

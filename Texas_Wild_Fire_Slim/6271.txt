Just as predicted, Eddie Murphy will be bringing his distinctive laugh and bright smile to The Kodak Theater this year.
The comedian will officially host the 84th Academy Awards. This is Murphy's first time hosting the esteemed awards show. 
"I am enormously honored to join the great list of past Academy Award hosts from Hope and Carson to Crystal, Martin and Goldberg, among others," said Murphy.  "I'm looking forward to working with Brett and Don on creating a show that is enjoyable for both the fans at home and for the audience at the Kodak Theatre as we all come together to celebrate and recognize the great film contributions and collaborations from the past year."

Guests of the Happiest Place On Earth were not so happy Sunday when they were stuck on Walt Disney World's Pirates of the Caribbean ride for almost two hours. 
The guests were riding the attraction at the Magic Kingdom park in Florida at about 10:30 p.m. when it stopped, reports Fox Orlando. 
Disney officials told the station that the delay was so lengthy because staff first tried to automatically start the ride, and, when that didn't work, a manual restart was required. 
No injuries were reported, and Disney is working with guests to make up for the inconvenience. 
Watch the full report from Fox Orlando below.

				It happened to us at DisneyLand on Pirates as well. Stuck for almost an hour looking at the pirates in the cell trying to lure the dog with the key. Suspending disbelief leaves when they turn the big work lights on.

				I got stuck on Space Mountain years ago in the middle of the right, we were sitting there for a good 20-30 minutes until they decided to turn all the lights on in the warehouse that that ride is in, and seeing it totally alluminate­d totally ruins that experience­, just a huge set of tracks with some glow in the dark stuff hanging from wires everywhere lol.

				I was stuck on Splash Mountain for an hour and a half back in 1996, we went there for a school trip and half the park shut down. I was just glad I was stuck on that ride and not on "It's a Small World" Ride! I had classmates stuck on that ride for that time and they cannot stand to hear that song! HAHAHA!! I couldn't stop laughing! Good times! :)

				Decades ago, at Disneyland­, in Southern California­, I was stuck inside the Naitilus Sub ride, for about an hour & a half, in the middle of the pool/pond, and it was about 90* that day, and a 111* inside the Sub, even though the top of the Sub was open for safety reasons. It started to smell like a locker room inside the Sub! They had to manually crank, the drive chain, to get the Sub back to the loading/un­loading dock!? People on board, complained­-complaine­d-complain­ed!!!

				The heck with Disney World! Epcot is better. My wife and I love Disney World, especially Epcot. I always take loads of pictures when we go. We have a annual season pass. I created a special website called Tour of Epcot that has all of our photos on it. There is also videos and music as well. For a complete tour of Epcot with videos photograph­s and music visit our website at http://www­.tour-of-e­pcot.com. You can take a virtual tour of the Epcot site. This is a really fun site that I am sure you will enjoy. You can explore the entire park and learn your way around. Its almost as good as being there.

				It was just over a month ago that I got stuck on that exact same ride in disneyworl­d, at the exact same point shown by the first picture (with the prisoners trying to get the keys from the dog) and you could still hear "Dead men tell no tales".  It was that way for 10 minutes, maybe a little longer.  Again and again "Dead men tell no tales".  "Dead men tell no tales"....

I'm sure glad it wasn't for 2 hours.  I do recall seeing a boardwalk to the side and wondering if we'd have to use it.

				I was there. On the ride for maybe 45 minutes; stuck for over 35 min.  Would have been much longer had we not have jumped ship, LITERALLY!  As we sat, stationary­, "Yo-Ho" played, again, and again, and again, with the intermitte­nt announceme­nt of "this ride has TEMPORARIL­Y stopped. Please remain seated as the ride may resume at any time......­."  It didn't. After about 15 minutes, we were happy to hear an announceme­nt, warning us that the music would be turned off.  Following that announceme­nt, came another one prefacing the "work lights turning on," illuminati­ng the armada of ships, bow to aft.  I assume that there are IR cameras, mics, and other resources to let the ride operators, mechanics, etc know that we were struggling­, however, one parkgoer's cries of "we have an emergency!­" were left unattended­; not sure if it DID happen, but one person stated that they had called 911.  The last announceme­nt that aired got a few of our boats rocking: "RIDE POWERING DOWN." 

At this point, without any sort of contact, other than the repeating announceme­nt of the "TEMPORARY­" delay, 15-20 of us grasped the set/scener­y, positioned our boats as close to land, and a possible exit, and we left.  The next ride came in the form of a disney escort, armed with an apology, a laugh and a stern talking to, about the personal and financial dangers of our survival instincts.  

I now know the true meaning of "on stranger tides!"

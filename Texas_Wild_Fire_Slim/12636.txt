I live in Ca.﻿ I have never in the 30 yrs I've been here see unemployment this bad.
While so many Americans are out of work, Obama & the Labor Department have already launched a program to allow hundreds of thousands of illegals﻿ to work in the US. Also note that this program was launched months before his expected jobs speech tonight. This , because he wants these illegals to say in the US instead of going back to Mexico which is just down the street

Clap louder, u fools, Never tried pushing rope uphill, R-U ? Whenever gov causes a crisis, WA & the president will almost surely give even more power & authority to the agency that's most responsible for the calamity﻿ ! I guess that’s all it takes, a speech by the president on﻿ the jamming $300 billion more adrenaline into the nation’s arteries to keep that pulse going. Americans love fairy tales. I can barely stand to hear the sound of his voice. Its static to my ears.

I've read all these replies and occurs to me that those that think the wealthy shouldn't have and do with their wealth have bought into the class﻿ warfare propaganda, which btw is what we all work and strive to be (wealthy), do you really think those that have worked and sacrificed to be where they are should pay those that are not as fortunates part???I think not! I was homeless for two years and never took anything I didn't work for, nor did I expect anything, if you want more them have the cl

The more I see him, the more I know this is a disaster in a disguise. I said it before & I'll say it again. I wouldn't trust him from my front door to my mailbox. Wouldn't buy a used car from him.
Everything from his﻿ facial expressions to body language, with his ever present rheumatoid arthritis curled finger to his attempts to sound like a fire breathing Baptist preacher at his campaign stops, do more every time to turn my stomach.

Obama is being runned by Israel. He's the opposite of what he says. I'm still waiting for good things to happen. He's just delaying the issues by spending more. I can't even get a local job in a damn supermarket or coffee shop. You call that job﻿ creation? Where is all this money going for job creation? Oh, those rich SOB's pockets.

May 29, 2011 – WILLIAMSON COUNTY, Texas – Residents in Williamson County interested in learning how to protect themselves from wildfire are invited to two town hall meetings next week.Meetings are set for 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, June 1, at Westside Elementary School in Cedar Park and at 7 p.m. Thursday, June 2, at Life Springs Christian Church in Liberty Hill. Representatives from Texas Forest Service and Williamson County fire departments will be on hand to answer questions and talk about what you can do to protect your home and family from wildfire. For example, you can reduce potential losses by adopting Firewise landscaping practices 100 to 200 feet around your home. That includes moving firewood and clearing dead and dense vegetation.Wildland Urban Interface Specialist Lexi Maxwell stressed that wildfires are a community-wide problem, which means reducing risks to homes and property is everyone’s responsibility.“More than 80 percent of wildfires in Texas occur within 2 miles of a community,” Maxwell said, reminding residents that roughly 95 percent of wildfires are started by humans. “We want to encourage residents to take proactive measures that could end up saving lives and property.”For more information, visit www.texasfirestorm.org and www.texasfirewise.org.

July 22, 2008--COLLEGE STATION, Texas--Texas Forest Service personnel have mobilized in preparation for Tropical Storm Dolly’s arrival in Texas.TFS personnel have relocated to South Texas to assist regional Department of Public Safety offices. Members of the TFS Lone Star State Incident Management Team have been mobilized to manage Regional Staging Areas (RSAs) and Points of Distribution (PODs) to distribute food, water and ice to storm victims. Three TFS-trained local-government teams, led by TFS personnel have also reported to San Antonio to assist with RSA and POD operations.  Why Texas Forest Service?  “Distributing food and water during a disaster requires the same organizational skills used in suppressing wildfires. Incident Management Teams have the capability to organize and manage the response to disasters by employing the Incident Command System. IMT’s receive a mission, plan an appropriate response, execute the plan and support the personnel and equipment involved in the operations,” said Mark Stanford, TFS fire operations chief. Tropical Storm Dolly is moving north-northwest through the Gulf of Mexico at 13 miles per hour. The system currently has sustained wind speeds of 65 mph, but its forward speed is expected to slow in the warm gulf waters and increase in intensity to a Category 1 hurricane.  Landfall is expected near Brownsville late Wednesday night. After making landfall, the storm is predicted to take a more westerly track across Mexico, so little or no rainfall is forecast for the drought-stricken areas of Texas. Although wind damage may be minimal, a high potential for flooding exists in the Brownsville area.  The latest storm track can be viewed at http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/tracking/at200804.html Contact Linda Moon at lmoon@tfs.tamu.edu

Two of the country's largest newspaper groups are joining to create a new digital company.
The Journal Register announced  on Wednesday that its CEO, John Paton, is also becoming the head of MediaNews Group, the second-biggest newspaper chain in the country. However, the two chains are not merging. Instead, the Journal Register is creating a new company called Digital First.
Paton will be the chief executive of Digital First, and also serve as CEO of both newspaper groups. The two companies will, however, continue to maintain their own boards. 
Paton said in a blog post that the company's mission "will be to accelerate the transformation of both these great firms to a modern, multi-platform media company focused on local news."
The creation of Digital First Media is the latest development in the Journal Register's digital strategy. The name "Digital First" refers to the Paton's recent mantra: "digital first and print last." The company has been building its online platforms, and appointed digital news veteran Jim Brady as editor-in-chief in August. 
The new company joins two newspaper groups with publications in eighteen states: the MediaNews Group's holdings are concentrated on the West Coast and the Midwest, while the Journal Register is a smaller publisher with papers on the East Coast.  MediaNews is no stranger to consolidation, having acquired approximately forty newspapers in the past two decades. The company's CEO Dean Singleton has been criticized for sacrificing good journalism for profit. 
Both companies have also filed for bankruptcy within the past two years. For industry observers who have watched the Journal Register's digital approach post-bankruptcy, the consolidation of the two companies comes as no surprise. 
Alden Global Capital, a hedge fund with a big stake in MediaNews, brought the Journal Register in July. The move generated speculation about a merger, with some predicting that Paton's digital strategy would land him the CEO seat for MediaNews.

				Usually media mergers mean loss of local focus.    That they claim the digital platform will have a local focus is interestin­g.How will they axe "redundent­" staff in the markets where their prinit products  compete,  while still offering really good indepedent news coverage on a local level?

				Our local papers merged then sold out to a 'national' media giant. We get the same news found in USA Today. Local news has become lightweigh­t, and investigat­ive reporting is rare and superficia­l.
Bigger news, bigger reporting bias. Read what they want you to read, hear what they tell you.

				This is sad. The Newspaper is really dying. There is no denying. I tried, but no, it's dying.

I grew up with the Hartford Courant. I delivered it as a kid. It was CT's paper of record. Of course, Hartford was once a grand city.

I also grew up with the Bristol Press. It was locally owned by the Barnes family and it was a sincere, local asset. Now it's owned by the J-R. And it's a tabloid for no real reason.

The merger of these two companies means less choice. Less diversity of opinion. Hartford used to have two dailies. Then one. Now the papers in Hartford, New Haven and Bristol among others will get the same perspectiv­e. Dull and dangerous.

I live in Vermont and cherish the Rutland Herald and Times Argus. They are locally owned and operated. And they have published this year though two floods. We don't get many deliveries in our town while we are awaiting repair of the roads that last week isolated us. I miss the paper with my breakfast. Real paper is a treasure.

But the newspaper is dying. I'm going to miss it.

The Atlantic:
French street artist JR claims to own the world's biggest art gallery. A semi-anonymous photographer who won this year's TED Prize, he posts giant portraits of human faces where people least expect it, from the facades of favelas in Brazil to broken bridges in Kenya's capital city.
The photographer, who goes by his initials because his work often involves criminal trespass, uses public art to tell stories of the voiceless. Since finding his first camera on the Paris metro, JR has plastered portraits of thugs in rich French neighborhoods; mounted side-by-side images of Palestinians and Israelis on the West Bank separation barrier; and displayed photos of dignified women in areas of conflict around the globe.

WASHINGTON (September 10, 2011)--President Barack Obama has signed a federal disaster declaration for Texas in the wake of wildfires in the state, which allows federal funding to be made available to individuals in Bastrop County where a massive fire killed two and destroyed about 1,400 homes.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs.







Some residents left homeless by a massive wildfire that has burned almost a week have voiced frustration over a perceived delay in federal response.
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, was among the state leaders pressing for the declaration.
"Last night FEMA announced that much needed relief is on its way for Bastrop County,” he said.
“There is a lot of hard work ahead of us, but aid is on the way for some of those Texans who need it most right now." 
Those in Bastrop County who suffered losses in the wildfire should register online.

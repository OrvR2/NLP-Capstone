The better to hear you with, my dearBy Lili Ladaga | The Newsroom – 7 hrs ago

The wolf from Red Riding Hood has nothing on a pooch named Harbor: Each of the black-and-tan coonhound's floppy ears is at least a foot long.
His left ear measures in at 12.25 inches, while the right is 13.5 inches long. Not only is Harbor able to hear a pin drop from a mile away, he can easily hear all the applause for his new title: The Guinness World Record holder of the "longest ears on a living dog."
Which begs the question: Does that mean there's a record for the longest ears on a "dead" dog? Ew.

The Texas Forest Service (TFS) offers federal cost share incentives to encourage private forest landowners to initiate preventive measures against future infestations of the southern pine beetle (SPB).  Precommercial thinning of 6-12 year old pine stands and first thinning of overcrowded pulpwood-sized stands within specified areas of East Texas known to be susceptible to SPB outbreaks are eligible for cost shares.  Specific criteria for participating in the cost share program can be viewed here.SPB Prevention Project offers increased cost shares and new logger incentives (July 2011)Southern Pine Beetle Prevention Program logger completion form (July 2011)Addendum to SPB Prevention Project Guidelines 2011 (July 2011)Application for Southern Pine Beetle Prevention Cost Share Program (July 2009)Terms and Conditions for the SPB Prevention Project  (July 2009)SPB Prevention Project Request for Extension or CancellationSouthern Pine Beetle Hazard Map (2003-2007)Southern Pine Beetle Prevention Program Eligibility (July 2009)

By some estimates, fare evaders cost Muni up to $20 million each year. That's only slightly less than the average budget deficit the agency has runs annuallymeaning that fixing Muni's non-payment problem would go a long way towards solving its seemingly ever-present budget hole.
As any regular Muni rider can attest, lacking the requisite two dollars isn't the only reason to avoid paying for a ride. Often, braving the line of people digging though their pockets for exact change seems far too arduous and an expensive ticket suddenly feels worth the risk.
One way the San Francisco Metropolitan Transportation Agency is considering to encourage more passengers to pay for their rides is to allow them to enter city buses through any door.
At present, passengers are only allowed board buses from the front door.
The San Francisco Chronicle reports:
John Haley, the agency's transit director, said all-door boarding would not only cut the amount of time buses spend sitting at stops waiting for passengers to board and pay fares, but would be more convenient for passengers and would eliminate confusion over the different fare systems on the light-rail and bus lines.

Muni's unique characteristics - high use, frequent stops and very low speeds - make the system a perfect candidate for all-door boarding, he said.
The new system will still require riders paying with cash board through the front; however, passengers using Clipper cards and transfer tickets will be allowed to enter through the rear doors.
The Bay Citizen reports:
Of course, anyone who rides Muni knows that bus drivers already allow all-door boarding at crowded bus stops. But technically, a rider could get a ticket for not getting on through the front door, and bus drivers don’t open the back door at every stop.

Under the all-door boarding plan, riders will need to use their Clipper card or have other proof of payment to board at the back door. Clipper card readers have already been installed at each bus door, but right now signs on bus windows declare: "STOP: Enter Through Front Door Only."
To effectively implement the plan, the agency would need to increase enforcement by adding additional fare inspectors to ensure people don't take advantage of the new system by skipping on payment even more often than they do already.
Muni already allows for all-door boarding on its light rail trains.
During the past fiscal year, Muni experienced its first decline in on-time performance in five years. The agency's on-time rate nudged down from 73.5 percent to 73 percent. This performance decrease is largely a result of service cutbacks made for budgetary reasons.
While these numbers fall well short of the voter-mandated 85 percent on-time rate, they're solidly in the range of other comparable transit systems throughout the country that similarly have to contend with street traffic and lack signal priority.
Agency officials are hoping that all-door boarding will go a long way toward decreasing the amount of time its vehicles spend sitting at bus stops.
The new boarding system may be implemented as soon as next year.

				I love how SF "encourage­s" people to pay while the rest of the country "makes" you pay or else get off. 

Just go across the bridge and try to not pay on AC transit.

				People do it anyway regardless of the fare-polic­e.  I've never actually seen a fare-cop on a bus.  They tend to congregate in the undergroun­d Muni stations downtown so they don't have to move or walk or ride the busses much.  

There's no chance they could ticket all the fare evaders on the 30 Stockton or 38 Geary lines, it would bring them to a standstill­.

Tropical Storm Nate made landfall over southeast Mexico just north of Veracruz. 
Nate will weaken throughout the day and will soon become a tropical depression then a remnant low over the Mexican state of Veracruz. 
It is forecast to dump several inches of rain over the region. 
The government of Mexico replaced the hurricane warning from Tuxpan to Veracruz with a tropical storm warning, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm is forecast for “rapid weakening” to a tropical depression as the center moves inland and to dissipate by tonight, according to the website.
The storm has prompted Petroleos Mexicanos, Latin America’s largest oil producer, to “defer” 178,700 barrels of crude output from offshore facilities and close two ports and evacuate five offshore platforms.

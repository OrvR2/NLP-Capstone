Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman's campaign is out with a new ad today, using the numbers "1" and "47" to set up a comparison between Huntsman and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.
What's up with the numbers? Is Huntsman trying to say that he has the support of one New Hampshire primary voter for every forty-seven that Mitt has? Of course not! I don't think Huntsman has nearly that much support in New Hampshire. Rather, Huntsman is touting his own record as a job-creating governor: he is the top man with a motorbike, and Romney is a sad Mitt left on the baseball field. Or something!

Huntsman takes his number one ranking from this Katrina Trinko piece from the National Review's Corner blog, and, in keeping with contemporary citations of baseball-based statistics, this one comes with an asterisk:
While all the GOP contenders are quick to hit the “jobs, jobs, jobs” mantra, the former governors running for president have very different records on job creation. According to a National Review Online analysis of seasonally adjusted employment data (looking at the total number of those employed) from the Bureau of Labor website, Gary Johnson has the best record of the official candidates, with a job-growth rate of 11.6 percent during his tenure.

But Johnson, who governed from 1995 to 2003, doesn’t overlap much with the other governors — Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, and Jon Huntsman — who are running. Among the crowd who governed primarily during the 2000s, Huntsman has the best record. During his 2005 to 2009 tenure as governor of Utah, the number of jobs grew by 5.9 percent.
So, Gary Johnson has a right to take issue with this. 
"One man's record is sadly similar to Obama's," says the ad, alluding to Romney. But let's get beneath the atmospherics of the ad for a second. What do we know of Huntsman's "jobs plan?" Lots, actually. The key features are: tax cuts for the wealthy, tax cuts for corporations, massive deregulation, repeal of the Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank, energy production through drilling in America and offshore. Outside of some differences at the margins, does anyone expect Mitt Romney's "jobs plan" to be much different?
I'd say no. So, this #1 versus #47 stuff from the past is irrelevant. Either Mitt Romney is going to be just as good at creating jobs as Jon Huntsman, or Huntsman is going to be just as terrible. 
(Most campaign reporters will tell you: "OMG! HUNTSMAN IS GOING AFTER MITT ROMNEY! SUCH STRATEGY!)

				It's not really hard to figure this out.  You'd have to take any of these governor's records of job increase/d­ecrease as a percent and then compare it to the national job increase/d­ecrease for that same period of time.  Then you wouldn't be comparing apples and oranges.

				Thoughts from DK - 

"The stupid, it burns:

At a meeting Saturday with a Missouri Tea Party group, Rep. Todd Akin (R-MO) served up some factually challenged red meat: 
U.S. Rep. Todd Akin said he has doubts about the constituti­onality of Medicare and thinks global warming “is highly suspect.”

Know what else is "highly suspect"? Akin's intelligen­ce."


"Ron Paul has an awesome new ad that covers all the major points: Reagan, Reagan, Reagan, Reagan, Rick Perry was Al Gore's cheerleade­r, Reagan, Reagan."

"So with the Republican­s losing their collective heads over the Fox-manufa­ctured Hoffagate, is this what they're talking about when they demand that the left be classy and civil like them?"

"The two top House Republican­s want President Barack Obama to huddle with congressio­nal leadership before his Thursday jobs speech to discuss potential areas of bipartisan agreement. 
In a letter to the president Tuesday, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) laid out several areas of common ground, including passing three long-stall­ed trade agreements­, reducing regulation and funding certain infrastruc­ture projects.

Now they have the time for a huddle? What happened to having to watch the GOP debate, or supervisin­g the security screenings or whatever the hell excuses they had for dicking with the speech scheduling­?

Bipartisan agreement? Seeking common ground? Uh-huh, and I've got a bridge to sell you."

				ok... out of all the loons running, or lemmings as the case may be, I think Huntsman is the least onerous... that being said... this commercial­, with it's pedantic, repetitiou­s drone of that same ole female voice-over that has done, like, a BAZILLION GOPer commercial­s all layered on top of that creepy church MUzak.... YUCK!   It has all the appeal of a colostomy.  Sorry, but whomever's advising Huntsman on his campaign release material needs to be kicked to the curb... this was a GAG!!!

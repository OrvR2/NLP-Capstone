If you think Obama is the wrong Guy for the Job, you have to believe McCain and Palin would have done a better job.  

I understand we always need to blame someone, but really Obama.  Let put the blame where it belongs, corporate greed.

What a shame.  More liberal press employees out of a job.  Remember when Obie said he thought we should subsidize them to make sure they stayed in business?  Gee.... that would put them in the same status as Pravda.....

Crazy Republicans listen to Bener when he is saying give tax cut to millioners because they will create jobs.10 years now they have tax cut so where are the jobs Mr. Bener?You are anyway so #$%$ you don't even know that the Congress have the opportunity to create jobs like giveing tax cut to the rich. It is another question that it is not working.So can you tell me why do you bring Obama and job creation together? Obama is executing the laws what the Congress legislate. Go back to school you still have to learn a lot.

Private pensions' funded status falls in AugustAP – 18 hrs ago





BOSTON (AP) — The funded status of the typical corporate pension plan fell 5.6 percentage points in August to 78 percent, the result of the stock markets declining and liabilities increasing for the second month in a row, according to monthly statistics published by BNY Mellon Asset Management.The typical U.S. pension plan is now at its lowest funding level in a year, the report said.Assets for the typical plan fell 3.3 percent, reflecting declines in U.S. and global equities. Liabilities rose 3.6 percent, as the Aa corporate discount rate decreased by 0.23 percentage points to 4.94 percent, the report said. Plan liabilities are calculated using the yields of long-term investment grade corporate bonds. Lower yields on these bonds result in higher liabilities."Growing concerns over the government's ability to stimulate the economy and deal with the deficit in the U.S. and the sovereign debt issues in Europe have both contributed to a tough situation for sponsors of U.S. corporate pension plans," said Peter Austin, executive director of BNY Mellon Pension Services, the pension services arm of BNY Mellon Asset Management.Growing pessimism in August caused a stock sell-off as investors moved to Treasuries and other safer investment classes. The extreme pessimism appears to have abated somewhat during the second half of August, as equities mounted a tepid recovery, Austin said. However, it's difficult to predict whether concerns about the global economic malaise and the effectiveness of government policy will diminish enough to allow the funded status of corporate pension plans to recover.

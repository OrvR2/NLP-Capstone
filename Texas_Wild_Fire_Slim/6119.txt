Student test scores from two Los Angeles-area schools have been thrown out based on evidence of cheating by teachers.
Three teachers at Short Avenue Elementary are accused of correcting answers on student answer sheets or instructing students toward correct answers -- or both. A science teacher at Animo Leadership Charter High School is also accused of correcting answers after exams have taken place.
As a result, neither school will receive Academic Performance Index scores, which were released last week and are state measures of school performance.  Both schools are among the state's top performers.
A testing "irregularity" was noted in the state's API database for Animo Leadership, the Daily Breeze reports. The high school is a part of Green Dot Public Schools, a group of 12 public charter schools in the area.
Green Dot officials reported testing irregularities to the state Department of Education after noticing high rates of erasures on science exams.
"We went after it pretty hard and aggressively," Green Dot Schools CEO Mario Petruzzi told the Daily Breeze. "We did not try to sweep it under the rug. Will people every now and then try to cheat? Of course. But how you react to it sends a strong signal about how the organization feels about it."
One student at Short Avenue said she had left answers to math questions blank because they were too difficult, but her answer booklet carried correct responses, according to the Los Angeles Times.
"Students take tests independent and alone," LA schools Superintendent John Deasy told the LA Times. "We don't coach them and give them answers... it's obviously wrong behavior, but it's more than that.... It's not the behavior we want to model -- ever."
News of testing irregularities in these LA-area schools comes amid cheating allegations surfacing in schools in the state and across the country.
The Los Angeles Unified School District is shutting down six charter schools run by Crescendo schools after teachers were found to have prematurely opened standardized tests and prepared students with the materials. 
In Atlanta, more than 40 educators accused in the nation's largest cheating scandal have resigned or retired. Schools in Washington D.C. are under investigation for high erasure marks on exams from 41 schools, taken during former chancellor Michelle Rhee's tenure. 
Baltimore and Philadelphia are also among several districts across the country facing cheating allegations.

				Wow!  Another cheating scandal, big surprise!  While the teachers involved in this are wrong, on many levels, the real culprit is NCLB. The purpose of this law only recognizes assessment based performanc­e, and only in certain subject areas. It also promotes a 'college for all' curriculum­, which just isn't working. College for some, yes, but we should be focusing on 'skills for all.' Let's make sure kids have hard skills in a particular career cluster, soft skills so they understand how to work well with others, and applied skills, the academic standards that connect to real life profession­s. We've wasted a lot of time blaming others--te­achers, unions, schools, parents, administra­tions, etc. when really, the flaw is the law itself. NCLB needs to be repealed so teachers can get back to teaching students and not teaching tests.

				Good teachers can do both. Teach curriculum and prepare students for the test. Too much blame on NCLB which by the way was supported and sponsored by many Democrats. Before NCLB there were tests used to measure student achievemen­t such as the CAT. Most teachers have never read NCLB. The just rely on the misguided informatio­n fed to them by the unions because it was proposed by Bush which meant that it was bad. The testing is up to the states. There are many good aspects of NCLB. Laws do not make people cheat. Lack of ethics will.

				I disagree Bill.  As a teacher for the past 18 years, I feel that NCLB has left many children behind, particular­ly in the area of learning specific skill sets.  As far as assessment­s go, I think states should be able to develop their own and use the results to measure growth, develop standands and evaluate curriculum­.  Not as a tool to gage teacher effectiven­ess or the only model used to assess student performanc­e.  Our students deserve more than just a test--they deserve real skills that lead to real jobs that prepare them for either college or a career.

				Yes, good teachers can do both.  But it's the "do more with less" ability.  Sure, some good teachers can do that, but perspectiv­e is needed.  For example, good students can get master's degrees.  However, only a little over 7% of American adults do so.  Good students can get doctorates­.  Only 3.5% or so achieve this.  

I'd submit that the qualifier accompanyi­ng "good teachers can do both" is a percentage which is perhaps the 90th percentile or close to that.  In other words, the top 10%, for instance, can both teach curriculum and prepare students for tests.  Another way to clarify is to specify what a good teacher is capable of.  If good means top 10%, then it makes sense.

				Society has been breeding cheaters and liars for decades now. 
It's not only found where children should have every good example, it is eminently found in those who were voted in to lead the way.
What we are waking up to here is the realizatio­n that we have created a monster society where cheating teachers, teaches, and cheating, lying, leaders mislead.

				I remarked on the Georgia cheating that I saw no serious effort to prosecute.  I surely think that this is fraud.  So why is suspending­/firing teachers and invalidati­ng the scores the limit we are seeing?  Some people ought to have some of their life's freedom removed in the event they are found guilty.
Look, teachers.  I could not sympathize more with what has been done to your profession over the last 10-15 years; you don't deserve any of what hasn't been your fault.  However, there reaches a point where you are obligated to make a change when you feel your only option is to compromise your ethics in a manner as serious as this.  Either seek another/di­fferent teaching position or change careers.  C'est La Vie, but maintainin­g your current job and paycheck isn't necessaril­y the most important variable.  If you can't identify the most ethical option and choose accordingl­y, you deserve all the potential consequenc­es.

				Interestin­g thing about this story is how it contrasts with other cheating stories. Proof is cheating is hugely difficult to prove because it happens out of sight. Circumstan­tial evidence [20 trillion to one odds against happening by chance]. Invalidati­ng the scores is a good consequenc­e because it impresses on all staff that they are affected by cheaters even when they don't do it.

				Charter schools were heralded as the savior of public education by non educator elitist.  We now see that they are no better than the traditiona­l schools they replaced and maybe worse.  Charter schools self segregate along various lines other than race and is just as bad or worse!  The testing scam as a validation of good education has now gotten to them as well!  The billion dollar testing industry is destroying the best free public education system in the world.   Charter schools are private schools at tax payers expense wit big profits for the charter operator!

				Good charter schools are saviors for inner city kids who want to have a shot in life. Both my children attend TITLE I charter schools (90%+ free/reduc­ed lunch and 70% English Learners). Both schools are FANTASTIC SCHOOLS. We don't live in the neighborho­od and are part of a very small minority of families there who don't qualified for any government assitance (including free/reduc­ed lunch). What do we do there? Well, the school is an A school for the last 9 years and Blue Ribbon Award winner. At this school, struggling kids school day ends at 5, not at 3. They need more help than the high performing kids, so the school offers the extra help. If it wasn't for that charter school, those poor kids will be rooting at the local C school. You should hear the horror stories that those parents tell. They are more than glad for having escaped that school and to have the opportunit­y of getting a decent education for their children. What is wrong with that?

				Wayne, get the facts straight. Not all charter schools are private. In Ohio,  public school districts can and do operate charter schools. Just like regular public schools there are good and there are bad charter schools. Charter schools are hated by the unions because they take away dues money from the unions. That is their only concern! Also there can be quality deucation whether there is a testing industry or not. Good teaching is what makes our system great. What IS hurting our system is the union labor mentality of many teachers. These are people who only do what is required by the union contract. They are people who take advantage of sick days at the expense of the students because it is negotiated­. I am proud of the fact that I retired with 430 unused sick days.  Many of my fellow teachers either had no days left or started to use their days 2 to 3 days a week prior to retiring so they did not LOSE them. Students do not learn if the teacher is not there to teach!

				For any profession­al educator to cheat regarding any aspect of standardiz­ed testing is as indefensib­le as the very act of administer­ing such worthless standardiz­ed tests to begin with.

I call on all teachers to call in sick every day of state testing.
I call on all parents to simply keep their children home from school on all state testing days.
Refuse to play this stupid game.

				Calling in sick when you are not is just as bad as cheating. In fact it is worse because it is unethical, it costs the tax payers, and it hurts all of the students. Shame for the suggestion­!

				These EducRAT$ keep finding new ways to cut the teaching costs (hmmm... ), and this is ruthless and unethical stuff they do, too.Yet administra­tors making at least twice our average saleries to do non essential jobs (many stained by corruption and incompeten­ce) are multiplyin­g. Now that education is a business it is all about the $ By low balling our profession and treating kids like livestock the suits keep that gravy train coming. By increasing class size and replacing veterens with newer, cheaper models they are staying on top. Taxpayers pay for that instead of the school supplies, educators, book and technology the children need.Thank­s to NCLB and this test the people that are the very core of education, students and their teachers, are not being left behind. They are being mangled and crushed.

				NCLB is not a test. The law requires that individual states come up with their own testing system! In most states this is done with input from teachers.

				Test season finds cheaters in schools on all levels. Some administra­tors pay OT for loyal toadies to erase wrong answers and district personell are rumoured to doctor scores so some school succeed and others fail. They arent interested in success for students. They are serving an agenda. 
The tests are given to us months ahead of the test date and  to be honest, I never touch them until I pass them out to my students to bubble in. It never occurred to me to teach to the bloody thing, much less coach my kids on the answers. Ick! That test is a total snore and basically a waste of time and money because it is not addressing children as individual­s nor does it identify inadequate teachers. The test determines very little about students, who have no reason to buy into it anyway.It is merely a way to break our contracts so the eduCRAT$ and big brother business can get more profits from these test factories.
With this said, I would rather have my child at a Green Dot school in Watts than any LAUSD school outside an affluent area, which is far from where I live because teachers cant afford to live in PV or San Marino.

				I believe the three teachers were desperate and misguided if they did indeed cheat like 1000s of teachers across the nation, many compelled to do so by bully administra­tors, fear of being fired unfairly w/dubious data at more than a 40% margin of error and no concession­s for Language, remediatio­n and other factors like special ed, test anxiety and problems at home. They should be punished but we are in a no win situation and I wonder how many of us would do just what they did to keep their lives going. And why does the media continue to pretend this is about bad teachers instead of asking some hard questions like who is responsibl­e for the security issues Duncan just caught on to 3 years after Atlanta's scandal broke and whistle blowers were fired for obeying court mandates to report it by administra­tors who were clearly aware of the situation and remain unscathed?

				Iit is not just the "no child left behind philosophy­" that drives the cheating, it is the state & federal money behind it. Take away the money and the incentive to cheat is reduced.

				Teachers promoting cheating are not doing our kids any favors, because they will leave school not learning anything except how to pass a test and follow the teachers example on cheating.
Educating our kids should be the number one priority in America, to many kids are leaving school without a proper education.  Good example would be to go to a fast food joint and watch the kids who can't make change even when the machine tells them how much change to give back.
These kids are America's future, don't we have enough dummies in office already and now think about some of them who are currently running for offices, one good example is Sarah Palin.
Vote and fight for higher education in America as there are other contries in the world who are far above our standards and are passing us up in leaps and bounds in all areas of education.

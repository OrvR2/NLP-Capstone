Liveblogging the GOP Debate: Perry DebutsThe Atlantic Wire - 10 hrs agoRick Perry and the rest of the GOP field are at the Ronald Reagan Library for the latest of the early campaign presidential debates. Sponsored by NBC News and Politico and moderated by anchor Brian Williams and editor John Harris, they'll be plenty of candidates to watch standing at the podiums reciting their talking points tonight. But, at least at first, all the attention will be lavished on a certain blustery Texas governor making his debate debut. In short, it's Rick Perry night, and we'll be live-blogging it all the way through here. ...

Al Gore, also known as global warming's worst nightmare, was one of those people. The former vice president and current cable TV mogul wrote in a blog post on Wednesday: More »Al Gore Is Very Disappointed with Obama's EPA DecisionGet Ready for Tonight's GOP Debate: Rick Perry NightThe Atlantic Wire - 15 hrs agoTonight is Rick Perry night. In a few short hours, all that anticipation about how the blustery front-runner will fare in an actual debate will be answered. NBC News' Brian Williams and Politico's John Harris will be hosting the hoped-for slugfest at the Reagan Library at 8 pm ET tonight (We'll be live-blogging the political theater right here). ...

Chris Christie may have finally found a position that will allow him to tamp down speculation that he'll run for president in 2012. After repeatedly denying he's planning on jumping in the race, Christie has been named vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association, Politico reported Wednesday. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has also been named to the executive committee. Rick Perry left his post as RGA chairman to run for president, and Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell took over last month. ...

Naturally, he was the opposite last night during his post-candidacy interview with Stephen Colbert. Asked why he dropped out after notching 3rd place at Iowa's Ames Straw Poll? "I came in third place behind Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul. I think that's enough for any one person to endure," T-Paw zinged. And then, this: When queried about "learning to juggle" for more attention, Pawlenty congenially responded: "I thought about shooting sparks up my butt. ...

Since the satirical article was published in 2009, its lore has only grown: even the staid New York Times homepage ran the photo in its lede position when appraising the satirical myth of Biden-as-aging-playboy last year. Today, Car and Driver published a new interview with the Veep, and does little to dispel this image of him. As Atlantic editor Garance Franke-Ruta tweeted, Biden sometimes comes across like The Onion version of himself: More »Joe Biden Keeps Encouraging the 'Onion' Side of HimselfThere End of Taking Off Your Shoes at the Airport May Be NearThe Atlantic Wire - Tue, Sep 6, 2011It doesn't sound like the change will come anytime soon, but it's at least been suggested. At a Politico Playbook breakfast on Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano gave hope to harried travelers everywhere by saying that the TSA requirement that passengers take off their shoes and scamper in their socks through backscatter airport screenings will eventually be phased out.

But perhaps more interesting than the attack angle is how Paul frames his own candidacy in light of Ronald Reagan. Name-dropping the Republican icon is a tried and true GOP tactic, but Paul's deep-voiced narrator begins the ad by explaining the Reagan's first presidential bid this way: "The establishment called him extreme and unelectable." Which is, of course, one of the more popular charges levied at Ron Paul. ...

This morning, the President was bombarded with three dour new polls from Politico/George Washington University, Washington Post/ABC News and The Wall Street Journal/NBC News showcasing--take your pick--"economic foreboding," "summer of discontent," or "rapid erosion of confidence" in his administration's policies.

On Monday, Politico reported her campaign manager Ed Rollins stepped down from day-to-day work to an advisory role, citing health concerns. “I wish I was 40 years old, but I’m not,” he said. “I’m 68 years old, I had a stroke a year and a half ago. I’m worn out.” Rollins's deputy David Polyansky resigned from the campaign completely. National Review reports that Keith Nahigian will replace Rollins. ...

The Republican governor of Texas has joined a crowded presidential field, and will enter the fray in earnest on Wednesday, for the first of three primary debates in 16 days.

The Post says this is notable because Washington is not a place that cultivates funny people, what with the inflated egos and wannabe alpha types and all. But we at the Wire find the more interesting part Lovett's story is the implication he wants to stop serving the President of the United States in order to have a more fulfilling career in the city of fake boobs. ...

Rick Perry officially declares 2012 presidential bidBy Holly BaileySenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey | The Ticket – Sat, Aug 13, 2011

Perry (Gerry Broome/AP)Rick Perry officially kicked off his long-expected bid for the 2012 GOP nomination Saturday, insisting the country's standing in the world is "in peril" because of President Obama's "rudderless leadership."
Speaking at a conservative gathering in South Carolina, the Texas governor delivered a harsh critique of Obama, slamming his handling of foreign policy and accusing the president of leading the country off a cliff when it comes to federal spending.
"How can a country fail so miserably to pay its bills?" Perry demanded, citing the nation's recent credit downgrade. "We cannot afford four more years of this rudderless leadership . . .  A great country demands a better direction. A renewed nation needs a new president. It's time to get America working again."
Perry, who was in the news last weekend for headlining a prayer rally in Houston, has previously cast himself as a strong social conservative in the race. But his announcement largely focused on the economy, as he touted as a record of job growth in Texas as a leading reason why he should replace Obama.
In a line that received wild applause, Perry vowed that one of his first steps if elected would be to repeal Obama's controversial health care law and said, as president, he would work to shift more power back to individuals and the states.
"I will work every day to make Washington, D.C., as inconsequential in your lives as I can," Perry declared.
Perry jumps into what is already a crowded GOP primary. Indeed, as Perry was declaring his 2012 intentions, many of his Republican rivals were on stage halfway across the country at Iowa's closely watched presidential straw poll. Even though Perry isn't on the ballot, his supporters have been out in force in the Ames event, encouraging attendees to submit the governor's name as a write-in candidate.
In South Carolina, the Texas governor did not mention any of his GOP rivals. Instead, Perry played up his record against Obama's, casting the president as someone who has "alienated" our foreign allies and "jeopardized" the nation's future by running up the federal deficit.
He talked up his own "unwavering belief" in America—hinting at a frequent conservative slam against Obama that implies the president lacks patriotism. It was a theme echoed in a message posted on Perry's new presidential website.
"What I learned in my 20's traveling the globe as an Air Force pilot, our current president has yet to acknowledge in his 50's--that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth," Perry said. "With God's help, and your courage, we will take our country back. "
The Obama campaign, which has been largely quiet during the GOP primary, issued a statement within minutes of Perry's announcement, describing the Texas governor as a "carbon copy" of Republicans in Washington.

Another sad day these unqualified republican candidates.The only thing I agree with him on is that obama is not doing his job but neither would he if he was in the white house which won't happen.We've always had differences and problems but now we are really in serious trouble.

Stunningly corrupt Perry is a natural as a GOP candidate. He sold the roads in Texas to china, He milked the Texas economy till it is now 30+ billion in debt, he sold out workers in the state for campaign funds, he bankrupted the school system by giving a tax holiday to the  rich only , now its a failed enterprise and when confronted with  drought.. he has a dialog with God , only God's not listening. Perry fiddles while Texas Burns...like I said ...the perfect GOP candidate !!

I been reading and hearing everyone complainin­g about the President and his policies plus the way he has handle the economy. Now, I want you to close your eyes and imaging you woke up the next day and there were a change and there was President McCain and Vice-Presi­dent Palin. Plus an all Republican Senate and House. Tell me how much better would your world be now? Please Convince the Democrat we made a mistake.

Tell me how the new President and Vice would handle the economy, war and jobs. Keep in mind that the Republican­s policies would all be used.”

Fun facts about Texas.

Out of 50 states Texas ranks:
47th in literacy
49th on verbal SATs
46th on math SATs
and has the third highest rate of teenage pregnancy.

They should be proud!
Here's an idea - send all the right-wing nut jobs to Texas, give them all guns, let them secede, and wait for them to kill themselves off!

Gubner Perry has single-handedly destroyed the Texas school system. We are now ranked 37th, a drop of 20 positions. He has also rewritten all history and science books to appease his snake-handling followers. Corporations create new (minimum wage) jobs in Texas for 3 reasons: No state corporation tax, no personal income tax, and all of the zoning incentives you can dream up. If you want a bunch of minimum wage jobs for illegal aliens and a free check to corporations to ruin the environment any way they see fit, then Perry is your man. For a closeted gaye former male cheerleader, Perry is one macho man, the perfect TEATARD candidate.

As a native conservative Texan I can say this about Perry. He's an idiot and I hope his losing bid can cost him the governorship too. This is the same man who would rather draw  big Hollywood to Texas over making sure our kids get a good education. Let's also talk about his attempt to make it a law for young girls to have to get the HPV vaccination.

My GOD people go read up on this guy before you place your support behind him. You'll find he's just an actor who pretends he's this conservative Christian. It's all an act because he knows people will buy it. The only reason he keeps winning elections is because the people who run against him don't have the same make up artist and hair stylist. Many will say "Well at least he's better than Obama." I say that Obama has nothing to do with this guy. I say make a better choice than this man. You can spray cologne on dog mess and it still doesn't change the fact that it's dog mess. Rick Perry is worthless ... plain and simple

Rick Perry says he "touted his record of job growth in Texas as a leading reason why he should replace Obama". 

Okay conservatives, here's the question of the day: Why do you say that "government should get out of the way of business" and "government can't create a single job, only businesses create jobs" and yet a conservative is touting HIS record of job growth? Can government create jobs or not?

Followup question(s): If government can create jobs, and hordes of republicans ran Congressional campaigns in 2010 based on their supposed ability to do better at job creation than the administration, then why haven't they created those jobs? Should they take credit for 9.1% unemployment?

I think the only thing Perry has going for him is his looks, even with that, he's kinda scary in an evil sort of way.

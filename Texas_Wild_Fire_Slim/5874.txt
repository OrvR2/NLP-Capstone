Moved to action by a recent trip to famine-torn Africa, 50 cent has launched an energy drink whose profits will feed 1 billion kids in the region.
The rapper has teamed up with Pure Growth Partners to bring Street King, a new energy drink, to the market, PopCrush.com reports.  Proceeds from every sale will go toward feeding 1 billion kids in Africa.  
"I grew up without money, but I didn't grow up hungry," 50 Cent said in a video introducing the product. "It's our responsibility to come together and do things to create a solution."
Street King hit stores this week, in orange mango and grape flavors, and the rapper is encouraging fans to register at the energy drink's website.
"I need you to utilize your energy--your voice--to provide additional motivation for me at times," 50 Cent said.

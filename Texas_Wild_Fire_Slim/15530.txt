He will be here again today to see the unveiling of the first phase of the permanent Flight 93 National Memorial that has been 10 years in the making. And he’ll be here Sunday, when the 10th Commemorative Memorial Service is held.

We will never forget the bravery of those men who fought to take the plane back in mid air. These men are true heros who went down fighting rather than like sheep being led to slaughter! 
My heart goes out to all the familys who lost loved ones that day, they will all be remembered in history.

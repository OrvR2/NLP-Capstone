Texas wildfire destroys at least 20 homes (Photos and video)
By  Sarah Anne Hughes

				As parts of the East Coast are underwater thanks to Irene, North Texas and Oklahoma City are experiencing devastating wildfires caused by severe drought.
The fire has burned between 3,500 and 7,500 acres of lands in Texas, NBC Dallas-Fort Worth reports. “Unfortunately, there are about 20, 25 structures that have been lost,” said John Nichols, a Texas Forest Service spokesman. “There are another 125 structures that are being threatened” near the Cliffs resort at Possum Kingdom Lake. 

The fire is zero percent contained. “The fire itself is pretty much out of control,” the Palo Pinto County Sheriff Ira Mercer told NBC. “This fire is not something that you can battle from the ground. The flames are jumping 150 feet in the air. It's not something you can put personnel in on.”
Fires are also raging in Oklahoma City, where 5,000 acres have been burned, the Associated Press reports. Ten to 12 homes have been destroyed.
See photos and video of the fires below.
Watch footage of the fires from the AP below.

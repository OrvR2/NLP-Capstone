As the sun set on an airport hotel parking lot in Austin, Texas, Roger Cosby needed to tell his story.
He had just witnessed a sight that many Texans are battling – a devastating wildfire.
The state's largest blaze, a massive, uncontained fire in Bastrop County near Austin, has scorched some 25,000 acres, destroyed at least 470 homes and forced about 5,000 residents to evacuate.
That wildfire on Sunday was near the house Cosby shares with his companion of nine years, Cindy Boyd.
Cosby was taking a nap, while Boyd was working in their shop, making decorative plates.
Then Boyd smelled smoke.
"Roger, we have to go now, we have to go now," Cosby recalls Boyd saying as she woke him.
The Bastrop home that Boyd has lived in for 26 years was on fire.
Cosby says quickly jumped into their car with a few belongings and sped down a long driveway with flames surrounding them on both sides.
"It was like opening the door of an oven," Cosby says.
He says he fears they have lost everything: the house, a workshop, a greenhouse, a truck and worst of all – six acres of trees surrounding the house.
Roger Cosby holds decorative plates, some of the few possessions he was able to salvage.
"It was Cindy's forest," says Cosby, standing next to their getaway car.
He says they hope to return to the house on Tuesday for the first time since the fire to see if anything survived.
"It's all gone. There is no way anything could be left," Cosby struggles to say.
Boyd's forest is now likely a scorched, version of the area she loved so much. They assume charred limbs are all that remain.
Cosby says they have no plans to rebuild on the land they love so much because they believe it will never be the same.

LOL, Big Tex that made me laugh. I love people like you who go on life with stereotypes and ignorance about the world. I am from Texas and do not speak like that at all. No I am not near the fire at all. Also, those plates may have sentimental vaule to him

It is really pathetic that some of you feel the need to come on here and crack jokes about the situation. When the people of New Orleans needed shelter, food and clothing, the citizens of Texas were there. We took people into our homes that we knew absolutely nothing about. When other states have experienced catastrophes (hurricanes, mudslides, etc.) our firefighters, rescue personnel and private citizens have been there ready to help in anyway possible. In fact, a large group of people left here heading towards the east coast ahead of the hurricane to help. I don't agree with the politics of Rick Perry. Up until recently, I was a die-hard Democrat. How I feel about Perry does not give me the right to diminish the worth of millions of people.

Wilbur, why are you mad at Texas?  What have we done to you?  Don't blame Bush or Perry on us – we didn't force them to run for President and CERTAINLY not all of us voted or will vote for either of them.  Your compassion is amazing – I hope if you are ever in such dire straights and there are only Texans around you, you'll find out what great people live in this state.

Perry is part of the reason why these poor Texans are out of their homes and have lost their belongings. He has cut so much out of the budget that Texas is ill-equipped to handle this catastrophe. His hardline stance against the fed. govt. has made declaring a state of emergency impossible, just so he can save face. He is Texas' single worse enemy!
Texas has my well wishes, but Perry sure as hell doesn't!

Quanah, TX
You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.  Perry has reasons for his hardline stance against the current administration of the Federal Government, and Perry didn't start the rift!!!  I do appreciate your well wishes for the state, which few others will give us.  For that I thank you.  For the other, please do a bit of research on the subject.

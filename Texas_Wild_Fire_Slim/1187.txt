There was once a time when Britney showing up at the VMAs with a snake around her neck was iconic. These days, Gaga incubates on the ride over and Katy Perry tries her hardest to look like a male nutcracker, all in the name of maintaining their standard. The concept of what it means to look famous has changed so entirely that a former sex symbol like Britney is a stranger to the party, as the clumsy awarding of the Lifetime Achievement Award at last night's VMAs made clear. To examine how the reign of the Britneys fell apart, walk with us, fashion babies, as we take a brief tour through the dimming of our hearts.

				being children of the 60's i i used to say my kids had not where else to go but straight, and that's exactly what they did.

the performers today have become cartoon characters­. they are going over the cliff together. one outlandish effort after another. if it's not the costume its a an outrageous­ly offensive video.  soon they will have no where else to go but back to being ladies and gentlemen.  horrors.

				Good point. Today the sky's the limit. Its not enough to have a good voice people have to go above and beyond. Katy Perry's probably the best one at doing this, ever since "I Kissed a Girl," she's known how the be shocking. Lady Gaga too, but she does it in a way that's just too much, which puts off a lot of people.

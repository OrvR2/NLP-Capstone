I could not really understand some Phil politicians. When they won the elections they swear before the bible to defend the constitutions, yet they file and/or support bills which attack or outright unconstitutional....

If I said a curse word or something as a kid, I'd either get my mouth washed out with soap, or got hot sauce put on my tongue. I'd also get spanked with the belt. There is nothing wrong with a little physical discipline. 

I think a lot of problems with kids today are because parents are too UNWILLINGLY to instill a little physical discipline. Taking away a kid's Gameboy isn't going to work. They'll just go play Xbox. They'll start conjuring up ways to manipulate "the system". As a kid, my parents would also threaten to take away certain things... and I brushed those things off and they didn't bother me. I'd find something else to do. But getting spanked... there was no way around that. 

There are probably better ways of parenting than just spanking... but I'd rather that than the soft parenting most people are doing now-a-days. Kids today really lack discipline.

FINALLY A GENTLE VOICE SPOKE ON BEHALF OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS.
WARREN BUFFET SPOKE IN FAVOR OF TAXES TO BE LEVIED TO THE VERY RICH.

WHAT A COMPASSIONATE  COMMENT FROM A VERY RICH MAN ! ! !

Warren Buffett needs to take all his money and his ideas and move to another nation that taxes the way he wants to be taxed.  He should know that he can donate all his funds to the US Govt if he wants and leave the rest of us alone with out own ideas about govt intrusion!

The only reason Moody's didn't downgrade us is that the Obama Administration got in bed with them by hiring one of their top people (imagine that). S&P was just rating us according to our track record, which is NOT GOOD. Does anyone actually believe we are serious about paying off our national debt? Certainly the Chinese don't.

Now the U.S. will be humbled, to the dust.

Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their 

fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill 

the face of the world with cities.

For I will rise up against them, saith the ELOHIM of hosts, and 

cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, 

saith YHWH. I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and 

pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of 

destruction, saith ELOHIM of hosts.

How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!

YHWH hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the 

rulers.

He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that 

ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.

The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into 

singing.

Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, 

saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against 

us.

Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: 

it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the 

earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the 

nations.

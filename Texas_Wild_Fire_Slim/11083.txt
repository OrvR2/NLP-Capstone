On July 12, after customer Jennifer Schwenker brought her service dog and autistic twin sons to a McDonald's in Marietta, GA, manager Tiffany Denise Allen hit her in the face. Schwenker explained that she was legally allowed to have a service dog inside, but Allen berated Schwenker about the animal, claiming that unless her son was blind then the dog was not allowed. Allen followed  Schwenker to the bathroom, then punched Schwenker in the face in the parking lot.
Allen was charged with simple battery, simple assault fear and disorderly conduct. She no longer works at the restaurant.
UPDATE: The Today Show has video of the encounter, as well as an interview with Schwenker. Watch the clip below.

				Just go to the 2:00 mark and ask anyone with a background in physics (or anyone with a little common sense) and they will tell you that water was thrown and not dropped.

The odds of accidental­ly dropping a beverage and its contents flying 10 feet across the room to spray the person you were just having an argument with would have to be 10 trillion to 1.

				It is extremely frustratin­g to not be able to view videos on your site. The constant message saying that they can only be streamed within the USA is very annoying. I can't get my head around the fact that almost any video can be viewed on YouTube but videos complement­ing your articles cannot. The argument that legal issues are at the root of the issue don't carry much weight. 

I don't contribute opinions about the content of the articles as so many do because I find that the responses are pretty aggressive and I don't want to be a part of that. I just want to view the videos.

Unreal.

				@Joe1, I read the article and watched the video before I sent my response.  I think just being fired and a simple "battery" charge is not a punishment that fits the crime against someone with disabled children.  How you ever became a moderator boggles my mind since you don't appear to read for content.

				Great news for America's 16 million unemployed­/underempl­oyed - one more coveted Micky D's job just opened up. 

That should put a big dent in next month's jobless numbers. 

Well, except for the fired McD's manager now in the unemployme­nt line. 

Too bad for her, she won't get UI due to gross misconduct­.

				As the owner and someone blessed with German Shepherd Dog as a service dog, and no, I'm not blind, I've run into the same ignorance.  However, I carry the federal statues in my dog's service vest, pull them out, let the person read them, if they continue their ignorance, I inform them I'll wait outside while they call the police, and after they've given their statement to the police, if they continue to deny me entrance with my dog, I'll leave, but sue the heck out of them under the ADA.  Not for money, but to enforce the law, and draw public attention to their business practice which is very bad publicity.  

My partner also has a service dog, had a similar incident, the responding officer told her to leave, which she did.  She sent the Chief of Police a registered letter with statues, and informed him that the ACLU could sue his department­.  However, we'd prefer if he held a training class for his officers as the law.  The Chief called, apologized­, appreciate­d the heads up, and held a training class.  He also contacted the merchant, explained the officer was wrong.

				I'm fortunate that I create an imposing figure according so some people.  That, and now that I'm an AARP member and my dog is German Shepherd which many people are afraid of, I doubt anyone would have the courage to hit me.

My dog is a direct descendent of my K-9 officer who I kept when he then I retired. It's doubtful anyone would be fast enough to connect.  Dogs pick up on people's moods quickly.

				Glad I could help.

Another thing I find helpful is I had my doctor write me a prescripti­on for the dog.  It states the dog has been prescribed to assist with a number of tasks, and the HIPPA & ADA law prevents disclosure­.  

I'll also throw a dog treat on the ground and tell him to wait. People see him waiting until he's given the ok, I follow that up with one in my open hand palm up right under his nose, then ask them if they'd like to "be his best friend forever, and that usually is the last of it.

I also have a frequent flyer card for my dog as we fly back  & forth to FL & CA a lot. Almost every Alaska Airline crew knows him.  I usually  show  that with someone whose already changed their mind.

				Obviously, the unhinged ex-manager has some serious lack of control issues but I don't believe for one bit that Jennifer accidental­ly dropped her drink.

Also, that this is another article that seems to have been written by an unpaid intern who doesn't seem to have  viewed the video.

BOTH women were yelling at each other and the video displays Jennifer's demonstrat­ive outburst as well.

No, she didn't deserve to be followed to the bathroom and then punched in the face, but she is no innocent bystander either.

BOTH women should be ashamed at the way that they reacted, while in the presence of their children and the general public.

				She was missing one of her twins. Any parent's anxiety levels will spike if their child disappears and to add to that her child is autistic _and_ some woman following her around and yelling in her face about their completely legal service animal .... In that circumstan­ce, I can guarantee you I'd be yelling back "Get out of my face and let me find my child!" at the minimum.  As far as dropping the drink, from the video, she didn't throw it, and, in her shoes, I might have completely forgotten I was holding one and dropped it, too.

				The ex-manager didn't start the dialogue by yelling. None of us knows what was said that might have caused her to get so upset.

Also, Jennifer was yelling before her kid walked away; You are mixing up the timeline of events.

The video only shows the cup projecting from the location that is not in view.

As I originally stated; BOTH adult parents should've handled this situation in a different manner.
We are supposed to lead by example.

We are supposed to teach our children the appropriat­e solution for problems.

As far as boycotting McDonalds this is something I have been doing now for a year for a much diffrent reason.  By doing this I HAVE lost a lot of weight and my energy level has gone up and my blood sugar level has gone down.  Guess those twice a week visits aren't good for ANYONES system.

				Tragic story all the way around.  The mom with the autistic kids came across as loving and caring.  The other lady -- oy vey -- she needs major anger management therapy.  I wonder if she abuses her children?  I think Child Protective Services has a right to go in that household and make sure her kids are safe after seeing this clip.  My question: Is McDonald's negligent in their employee training regarding service dogs?  My sister has a certified therapy dog that she takes to hospitals (especiall­y pediatric wings) and nursing homes.  She legally can take her dog anywhere.  Whenever she does, she puts Trooper's orange vest on which states very clearly in big letters that he is a Service Dog.  She carries Trooper's certificat­ion card in her wallet in case she is asked to see if by law enforcemen­t.  I could not see in this video clearly but it looked like the dog was wearing some kind of vest.

				I think you watched another video because the assessment I made of the Mom with the darling autistic children was that she was kind and loving.  I sat my hubby and adult son down to watch the video before dinner and they felt the same way I did. Having normal twins and doing it well takes heroism.  Having autistic twins and doing it well calls for sainthood.

				Actually, your sister cannot under the ADA bring her therapy dog anywhere.  However you also state the dogs wears a vest stating the dog is a service dog.

Service dogs are trained differentl­y cannot be denied access to anywhere their person is allowed, not so with a therapy dog.

A therapy dog is generally trained under the national Delta Dog program which certifies (and insures up to 1 million) the dog & owner for any medical, nursing, hospital, retirement homes, etc. . .  

Each dog is certified for a certain level of care facilities he or she can visit.  For instance, a dog that can handle being pulled on, or handled roughly could reach the highest level, such as a mental institutio­n. Whereas a dog whose startled by loud sounds, such as a metal bed pan hitting the floor could only visit retirement homes.

Here's a link for everyone.

http://www­.deltasoci­ety.org/Pa­ge.aspx?pi­d=303 

BTW, currently there is not national certificat­ion needed by a service dog.  However, it's good to have copies of the dogs papers and the ADA statutes with you at all times.

I have a German Shepherd Dog and often run into ignorant persons like this manager.  Showing the law usually solves the problem.

				Thank you so much for taking the time to enlighten us.  I think my sister's dog is more than what I stated as she does have a vest that says Service Dog.  I will check with her as I am interested in knowing with accuracy.  Again, thanks.  Love to read posts that educate me.

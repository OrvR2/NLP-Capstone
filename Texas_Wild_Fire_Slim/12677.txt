Chicas Tecate voting ends Sunday

Voting for the 2012 “chicas Tecate” closes Sunday, with two Houston residents among the 10 finalists.
The top four vote-getters will represent the popular Mexican import at events. Tecate reports in a news release that arrived this morning:
This summer, adults who “liked” the Tecate Boxing Facebook page have  had the opportunity to meet – via photos and video – 50 candidates from Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Dallas and Houston, and vote up to five times per day for their favorite. The two chicas with the most votes from each of five cities moved on to make up the top 10 finalists …
An earlier Beer, TX post and photo slideshow about the Houston portion of that voting generated a lively discussion.
Today’s news release includes the following facts about the finalists, including Houston winners Cynthia Piña and Eliana Moreno:

  Lisa Garcia  (Los Angeles): Of Mexican descent, Lisa values her education, having already earned her Bachelors degree and currently pursuing her MBA.
  Paulina Borrero  (Los Angeles): Born in Medellin, Colombia, Paulina moved to the U.S. six years ago to pursue her dream of becoming a pediatrician.
  Karen Franco  (New York): Karen is originally from Queens, N.Y. and is a big fan of the pugilistic sport, appreciating the courage and determination that boxers show during every round.
  Monica Barco  (New York): Monica is a Colombian model and actress currently living in New York City.
  Mara Siqueiros  (San Francisco): Mara was born in Los Angeles, but was raised mostly in Mexico City. She loves to travel, workout, go to the beach and play with her dogs.
  Denisse Gonzalez  (San Francisco): Denisse is originally from Montebello, Calif., and celebrates boxing for the dedication, passion and adrenaline that athletes bring to the ring.
  Christina Salazar  (Dallas): This Texan beauty has  been a professional fine arts artist for 8 years. Christina is a big  sports fan who loves living by the beach.
  Thaly Andrea  (Dallas): Thaly hails from Cartagena, Colombia, and has been working as a model in Dallas during the last two years. She holds a Bachelors degree in Accounting, and considers Manny Pacquiao to be her favorite boxer.
  Cynthia Pina  (Houston):  Originally from Monterrey, Mexico, this Houston resident believes in hard work and pursuing your dreams.
  Eliana Moreno  (Houston): Elena, a proud  Colombian, holds a degree in Civil Engineering and is an active,  competitive, and professional volleyball player.

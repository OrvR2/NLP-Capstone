Learning From Last Year's Disappointment


												Published 09/08/2011 - 10:30 a.m. CDT 
											














																"There was one thing that was the same this year and last year. I came out of the arena with tears in my eyes but this year, they were the good kind," Farris said. 
															

 Last November, I had the opportunity to show my
horse, Lyles Al Lie, at the World Show in Amateur
Hunter Under Saddle. If you are short on
time, or donât dwell on the past, I can quickly
summarize it for you--I choked in the
finals. After the finals in 2010, I vowed to
myself, my family that I would learn from that
experience.

Multiple World Champion, Cool Assets, Sells to Emily
Cramer



												Published 09/07/2011 - 10:45 a.m. CDT 
											














																"Out of a situation I thought was a season ending disappoint, came one of the greatest opportunities and privileges Iâve ever had as an exhibitor and owner. Itâs truly a honor to be able to own and show this horse," Cramer said. Photo Â© The American Quarter Horse Journal 
															

 GoHorseShow would like to congratulate Emily
Cramer on the purchase of 
multiple World
Champion, Cool Assets, from Rebekah Kazakevicius
of Ocala, Florida. Cramer rides with Highpoint
Performance horses and 
will be showing in the
amateur all-around events. Emily's horse, Gotta
Get Some Sleep, injured his deep flexor tendon
this summer and
 Cramer decided she needed to
start looking for a new horse.

Texas wildfire destroys hundreds of homes 
A wildfire burning near Austin, Texas, destroyed about 300 homes, forced the evacuation of many others and was advancing unchecked on Monday through parched ranchland along a 16-mile front, authorities said.

The fire had blackened more than 17,500 acres since it started on Sunday and 
  was the largest of the dozens burning in the drought-stricken state. It was 
  headed away from the state capital, some 30 miles to the northwest, and 
  consuming the water-starved woods and brush with such ferocity that it was 
  deemed unsafe to fight from the ground, Texas Forest Service spokesman Jan 
  Amen said. 


"It's a monster and it's zero per cent contained," Ms Amen said. 


Instead, the state deployed its firefighting air fleet, including National 
  Guard helicopters and four heavy tanker planes. It also summoned a tanker 
  from South Dakota. 


Emergency shelters were set up for those forced to evacuate their homes. About 
  30 people spent the night at a Bastrop church, waiting to learn if they had 
  lost everything. 


Texas is enduring its worst drought since the 1950s, and the wildfire threat 
  has been exacerbated by powerful wind gusts cast off by Tropical Storm Lee, 
  hundreds of miles to the east. The blaze near Bastrop among at least 63 that 
  had started Sunday or Monday.

Gov. Rick Perry cut short a campaign visit to the key nominating state of 
  South Carolina on Monday and cancelled a planned trip to California in order 
  to return to Texas to oversee the firefighting efforts, Ray Sullivan, a 
  spokesman for the Republican's presidential campaign, said in a statement. 


Mr Perry said: "We will pick up the pieces, we will rebuild."


"I urge Texans to take extreme caution as we continue to see the devastating 
  effects of sweeping wildfires impacting both rural and urban areas of the 
  state," the governor added in a statement on his website.


There had been no reported injuries linked to the Bastrop County fire. But a 
  fast-moving blaze in the East Texas town of Gladewater on Sunday killed a 
  20-year-old woman and her 18-month-old daughter, trapping them in their 
  burning home. That fire was eventually extinguished. 


Nearly half of Bastrop State Park, a 6,000-acre preserve east of Bastrop, was 
  gone, KVUE-TV in Austin reported. 


The park and several major highways in the area were closed but a handful of 
  people whose RV's were left overnight in the popular park were being allowed 
  in to retrieve them, she said. 


Texas has experienced more than its share of destructive storms, including 
  Hurricane Ike three years ago. But the state's anxious farmers and ranchers 
  would have welcomed the rain that Tropical Storm Lee dumped instead on Gulf 
  Coast states further east. Instead of water, Texas got winds, which combined 
  with an advancing cold front to heighten the wildfire threat. 


All but three of the 254 counties in Texas were under outdoor burn bans.

As wildfires destroy homes in Central Texas, the Austin community gathers to give back the best way it knows how – with food, drinks and great music.  After you have given all you can, by donating clothes, food and supplies at any one of the drop off locations listed here on KUT's website, go out on the town to give a little more.
On Friday, Sept. 9, Citizen Generation will be hosting a happy hour at Molotov Lounge from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. The $20 cover will get you two complimentary cocktails and entertainment by Johnny Bravo. Watch your money multiply as the Calendar Club matches up to $1500 of donations.
The Sweet Relief bake sale will be held at the Community Renaissance Market on Saturday, Sept. 10. From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., local bakeries will be peddling cupcakes and cooki and donating the proceeds to help wildfire victims. Some of the participating bakeries include Objects of Confection, Sugar Pop Sweet Shop, Sugartooth Bakery, Cake Maker 3000 and Lemongrass Creations.
The Nutty Brown Cafe will host the Strings Attached Benefit Concert for Wildfire Victims on Saturday night at 9 p.m. A $10 suggested donation will go to Travis County Red Cross and the phenomenal line-up of musicians includes Jon Dee Graham, John Pointer, Tameca Jones, Los Texas Wranglers, Karen Mal, Robert Kraft, Strings Attached House of Wills Show, Steve Carter, Mark Utter, Jennifer Jackson, Mike Sailors and more.
Sunday night at 8 p.m. the Red Shed Tavern will have live music by Shelley King, Wendy Colona, John pointer, Mark Allen Atwood, the Chavelles, Ginger Leigh and Will Dunlop. The cover is $15 and donations of non-perishable food items are also encouraged.
Stay tuned. More benefits are sure to come as Austin rallies to support those who have lost their homes.

Killed Al Qaeda figure was key communications link for terrorist networkBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Mon, Aug 29, 2011

Atiyah abd al-Rahman. (State Department)When senior American officials confirmed Saturday that a senior al Qaeda operative, Atiyah abd al-Rahman, had been killed in Waziristan, Pakistan last week, familiar headlines proclaiming that "al Qaeda #2 official killed" flashed around the world. But Atiyah abd al-Rahman was not a figure of global notoriety, like Osama bin Laden, who was killed by U.S. commandos in May, and bin Laden's designated successor Ayman al-Zawahiri.
Nevertheless, counterterrorism analysts say that the significance of Atiyah's loss to al Qaeda has, if anything, been understated.
"While there is no doubt that bin Laden's death was the more significant blow politically, Atiyah's death may have a larger impact on how the al-Qaeda network functions," writes counterterrorism analyst Brian Fishman at Foreign Policy.com's AfPak channel.
Atiyah, who was born in Misrata, Libya around 1970 and served with bin Laden in Afghanistan in the 1980s, was a key communications link connecting al Qaeda cells hunkered down in Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and North Africa, Fishman explains. "Atiyah was not the ultimate decision-maker," Fishman writes, "but he was the information crossroads."
For example: In 2006, the U.S. military declassified a December 2005 letter written by Atiyah to the then leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi that it had obtained.
The letter "indicated not only that Atiyah had been an influential player in jihadi circles for years, but that he had a freedom of movement from Pakistan into Iran that was, if not unique, then very rare," Fishman, who works at the New America Foundation, writes. Indeed, the U.S. Treasury Department officially designated Atiyah as a terrorist only last month, classifying him as a member of an al Qaeda fundraising/logistical support cell whose chief, Ezedin Abdel Aziz Khalil, resides in Iran.
Given that al Qaeda cells were already hampered from using electronic communications, and their freedom of movement severely restricted by U.S. surveillance, drone strikes and other means, Atiyah's killing in a U.S. drone strike Aug. 22 is likely to make his al Qaeda interlocutors in the organization even more paranoid and concerned for their own security. "His contacts must nevertheless now wonder what U.S. intelligence personnel knew [of] his activities and communications that might now put them at risk," Fishman writes. "In a network reliant on trust, that suspicion creates a host of challenges for regenerating Atiyah's functional role."
The upshot? Less communication and coordination among the disparate al Qaeda offshoots operating in Africa, North Africa, the Middle East, and its "core" of fewer than 100 members operating in the tribal areas of Pakistan. "Atiyah's death will hasten al-Qaeda's inexorable shift into a social movement that shares strategic guidance overtly but operates in self-contained cells," Fishman writes. "Analysts have exaggerated this trend in al-Qaeda for years; in this case, however, life is imitating commentary."

Rahman was Bin Laden's emissary to Iran 
Press Release / July 11th 2011 / For Release immediately 

Candidate Spencer Zimmerman praised Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson in seeking a full investigation into whether Pakistan officials knew of Osama bin Laden’s location and offered him support during his years in hiding and urged the Senator to join Zimmerman in seeking an investigation into evidence that surfaced in a lawsuit by the families of the 9/11 victims suggesting that Iran had advance knowledge of the attacks and helped train the hijackers. 

"Shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden Senator Nelson rightly called for a full investigation into incriminating facts that Pakistan was harboring the terrorist mastermind for several years. Issues of vital national security should be devoid of partisan politics, and I commend the Senator for his actions and strongly urge him to pursue the truth in this matter. 

"Regardless of who becomes Nebraska's next Senator justice must be served against all who aided the 9/11 terrorists. For this reason I ask Senator Nelson to join me in calling for a full investigation into Iran's role in the 2001 attacks, specifically evidence that has emerged in a lawsuit by the families of the 9/11 victims suggesting that Iran had advance knowledge of the attacks and helped train the hijackers. This investigation should determine if Iran shared advance knowledge of the attacks with Russia which cooperates closely with Iran on their nuclear program," Zimmerman said. 

"On September 11th 2001 Russia was conducting the largest exercise of their Strategic Nuclear Forces since the end of the Cold War. Exercises which included mid air refueling for the first time in nearly a decade, I don't believe this was a co-incidence. At about the same time the 9/11 hijackers entered the country so did 10 deep cover Russian agents that were finally arrested in June 2010. These facts seem to point toward Iran sharing advance knowledge of the 9/11 terror attacks with Russia," said Zimmerman. 

Report by the Nuclear Threat Institute: 
9/14/2001: 37th AIR ARMY EXERCISE CUT SHORT 
Agentstvo voyennykh novostey reported on 14 September 2001 that an air exercise of the 37th Air Army was cut short due to the terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001. The original exercise plans included flights over the Arctic and the Atlantic Ocean and mid-air refueling. Training for mid-air refueling has not been carried out since 1993 due to budget constraints. Flights over the Arctic and the Atlantic were cancelled, however, reportedly at the request of the US State Department.
[1] The air exercise involved 2,000 personnel, including 24 crews of Tu-160 [NATO name 'Blackjack'], Tu-95MS [NATO name 'Bear-H'], Tu-22M3 [NATO name 'Backfire'], and Il-78 [NATO name 'Midas'] aircraft. It also involved 12 crews of Su-27 [NATO name 'Flanker'] fighters and 15 S-300 surface-to-air systems.[2] Sources: [1] NTV, 14 September 2001; in "Russian NTV reports on interrupted aviation exercise in northern Russia," FBIS Document CEP20010921000092. [2] Agentstvo voyennykh novostey, 14 September 2001; in "Russian Air Force chief praises strategic air force army exercise," FBIS Document CEP20010914000136. {Entered 5/6/02 RG} 

Information obtained at Spencer Zimmerman for Senate 2012 on Facebook.

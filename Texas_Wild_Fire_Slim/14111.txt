HOUSTON - Footage of the Texas wildfires can be terrifying to watch and difficult to understand in context. The Bastrop fire is the largest of several big fires burning across the Lone Star State, having already consumed an area almost the size of Washington, DC. In this video news report, FOX 26âs Ned Hibberd has the maps and the stats to give you some perspective on these fires.

Lacey the alpaca is friends with all of the adult cats on her farm, so it makes sense that she'd get excited upon seeing her first kitten. Whether or not the kitten wants to snuggle with her is another story. 
Watch a fresh-out-of-her-first-haircut Lacey try (and sort of succeed) to nuzzle a very confused kitten below. And be sure to check out her awesome manicure.

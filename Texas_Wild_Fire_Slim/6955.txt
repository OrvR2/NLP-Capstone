Cyndi Lauper’s rough 9/11 national anthem at U.S. OpenBy Chris Chase | The Upshot – 8 hrs ago

Cyndi Lauper's tribute to 9/11 before the U.S. Open semifinal between Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki started out with far greater gravity than you'd expect from the singer of the theme song to "The Goonies." The former pop star called for a moment of silence before breaking into an understated rendition of "The Spar Spangled Banner." It was all going well.
Then she pulled a Christina Aguilera and messed up the words. I'd tell you when the flub comes in but, don't worry, you'll know. (Fine, it's at the 0:48 mark of this clip.)
 
The biggest difference between Cyndi and Christina, besides relevance, is that Cyndi didn't cover her flub very well. If you watched the Super Bowl anthem and didn't know the words, you wouldn't have been able to tell Aguilera botched it. She covered it up like a pro. Lauper, on the other hand, mumbled her way through the line she messed up, like an elementary school student who forgets the lyrics to "Tomorrow."
Let's not be too hard on her for this, namely because the far greater patriotic insult was that Statue of Liberty dress.

They need to quit getting and paying these celebrities to sing the National Anthem. There are PLENTY of regular people in the world who can sing and have enough respect for this country to memorize the words and not flub them.

I'm so tired of Hollywood singing our National Anthem. How about our Military, Firemen, Police, EMT's, and their families? (Just to name a few) The true American Heroes.

@Server Error, you are an error my friend. You represent the hateful, biased, and racial bigots that give this counrty its name outside of our borders. No wonder they still have us so much. We should get rid of illegals and all that, but beyond that you are obviously a racist, probably IKA or skinhead or something.

The poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men's social club in London. "The Anacreontic Song" (or "To Anacreon in Heaven"), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. Set to Key's poem and renamed "The Star-Spangled Banner", it would soon become a well-known American patriotic song. With a range of one and a half octaves, it is known for being difficult to sing. Although the song has four stanzas, only the first is commonly sung today, with the fourth ("O! thus be it ever when free men shall stand...") added on more formal occasions

These so called singers sure have no problem remembering the words to rap crap like bit@h and Ho, do they. They can do me and a whole lot of people a big favor by sticking to their own hits. If they can't remember the words to our National Anthem, that's pretty disrespectful to get up there and slaughter it. Just sit it out next time girlie.

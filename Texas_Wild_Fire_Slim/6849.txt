SEC is ready for Texas A&M to join conference


Tweet














					By MATTHEW WATKINS

Southeastern Conference Commissioner Mike Slive said on Monday that the conference has already begun planning next year's athletic schedules with Texas A&M among its members. 
No official announcement about A&M joining the conference has been made, but the statement was the strongest public indication so far that the Aggies will be in the SEC next year. 
"In the 78-year history of the SEC, the conference had accepted the membership applications of only two institutions -- Arkansas and South Carolina," Slive said in a statement. "Texas A&M is now the third. We remain optimistic that Texas A&M will be a member of the SEC and have started to look at schedules for 2012-13 involving 13 teams."
Slive also said the SEC doesn't have immediate plans to add a 14th team. 
The SEC presidents planned to accept A&M's application into the conference on Sept. 6, but held back after A&M's current Big 12 competitor Baylor indicated that it might sue the SEC if the Aggies joined. Instead, the SEC accepted A&M under the condition that the conference receive assurance that none of the schools in the Big 12 would sue them. 
Baylor's action was widely perceived as a last-ditch effort to keep the Big 12 together. Two teams -- Nebraska and Colorado -- left last year and many have speculated that the conference would collapse if A&M became the third. 
Baylor, which is the Big 12's only private school and has a relatively small fan base, would likely have difficulty joining another major conference. Experts say the dissolution of the Big 12 could cost the school millions of dollars. Some of its fans have criticized A&M for seeking to leave, noting that the Aggies reaffirmed their commitment to the Big 12 just last year. Plus, they say, the Big 12 just recently signed a new television contract with Fox Sports. 
But A&M President R. Bowen Loftin disputed that argument Monday during a meeting of the A&M Faculty Senate. In response to a question from a professor who said that leaving the Big 12 would require A&M to break a contract it signed just last year, Loftin stressed that the Aggies have no contracts binding them to the Big 12. 
"There is no contract provision that requires us to be a member of the conference," he said in the firmest public explanation he had given to date. 
The only contract relevant to the situation, he said, are the Big 12's TV contracts, but those were signed by the conference, not A&M. 
"There is no contract provision that requires us to be a member of the conference," Loftin said. 
A&M is tied to the Big 12 by bylaws written in the 1990s, he said. Those, however, provide specific provisions for how the Aggies can leave. Loftin has indicated that A&M is trying to follow those as it tries to join the SEC. 
Loftin did acknowledge that he publicly expressed his commitment to the Big 12 in June 2010 with the following statement: "Texas A&M University is committed to the Big 12 Conference as it is today."
On Monday, Loftin stressed the importance of the phrase "as it is today."
"At that day, [the Big 12] had 12 members," he said. "It does not have 12 members today."
Neither Slive nor Loftin explained what needs to happen to make the move official. Many have speculated that both sides are waiting to see whether Big 12 member Oklahoma leaves for the Pac-12.
But both sides made it very clear Monday that the move will happen. 
"Texas A&M is an outstanding academic institution with an exceptional athletic program, passionate fans and wonderful traditions," Slive said. "While the SEC wasn't thinking about expansion, it was impossible not to be interested in Texas A&M."

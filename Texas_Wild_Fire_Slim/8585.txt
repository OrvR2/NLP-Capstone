   Doctor at Athenix Body Sculpting Institute Says New  Micro-Body Contouring May Replace "Regular" LiposuctionPRWeb – 50 mins ago





   Maurice Sherman, M.D. Comments on New Micro-Body Contouring saying, "This gentler and more precise body contouring process offers advantages over conventional liposuction."Pasadena, CA (PRWEB) September 08, 2011  “Conventional, classical liposuction may be obsolete,” says Dr. Maurice Sherman, Chief Medical Officer of Athenix Body Sculpting Institute. "It's a strong statement, but true,” he says. "Liposuction is the most popular cosmetic procedure in the world, but there is room for improvement - dramatic improvement." 
"Athenix Body Sculpting Institute has developed Micro-Body Contouring, a new process which delivers beautiful results with the benefits of being done under local anesthesia," says Dr. Sherman. "The process uses the Body-Jet® device and laser liposuction techniques to permanently remove fat with less downtime and without major surgery."  
"Conventional liposuction techniques and even the newer 'fat-melting' procedures still require aggressive and rapid back and forth motions, and fat must be aspirated or suctioned out," says Dr. Sherman. 
According to Dr.Sherman, the Micro-Body Contouring process allows Athenix’s surgeons to sculpt body areas more precisely, with more predictable results. "Micro-Body Contouring has an even wider appeal than conventional liposuction because it is done under local anesthesia, so downtime is kept to a minimum. Patients are able to return to work within days of their procedure," he says.

About Body-Jet®:
The Body-Jet® uses a fluid jet to navigate through tissue, a process that until now required manual force from the surgeon. This process allows the surgeon to use considerately less energy than typically required for fat removal, which provides a much gentler experience for the patient. The system allows the suction cannula to move freely without causing trauma to the fat or any of the surrounding structures, and the stream of water flushes out the fat cells after they have been loosened. With Micro-Body Contouring, recovery is minimal. The result is a more naturally tightened and contoured body.

It's pretty simple, try to tell the families of the victims who were aboard the plane that these people really didn't die or were not at all on that plane.  that would make a more interesting conspiracy don't you think?? or maybe these families are ALL in on the conspiracy?!!  Mindless conspirators!!!

Dogma of New World Order (NWO) conceived by Zionists and neo-cons Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz and Dick Cheney in 1990 presented Islam as the chief threat to western capitalist system and the US uni-polarism after the fall of Soviet inspired communism.

    If you do not believe that 9/11 was an inside job and you are convinced that 19 young arabs can out-smart and out-wit the most sophisticated intelligence in the world.... think again.

Does anyone see the stupidity in the headline???  "Did Pentagon surveillance tapes showing the impact of Flight 77 ever surface?

In 2006, three security camera videos were released in response to a December 2004 Freedom of Information Act lawsuit...."

So, FIVE YEARS later, a very fuzzy video of who-knows-whatthehell is shown hitting the Pentagon, (look it up on Youtube), the most heavily protected and surveilled building on the PLANET, and the Pentagon can show us no video that's any better...  AND they had to be FORCED to show the little that they did, due to a LAWSUIT FIVE YEARS later!  Nothing to hide?  My foot!  Did you know that the FBI went around confiscating every gas station and convenience store video that they could get ahold of?  How is that National Security???  If we were attacked by outside forces, the government would LOVE the chance to show us, not hide it!

Ummmm, I noticed in the picture where a HUGE 757 was to of hit the pentagon. There are many pieces of the pentagon building all over the place. Americans, please tell me a (CANADIAN) "WHERE" are all if any - the pieces of that "HUGE" 757 Airliner????? In every picture I've looked at there are many hundreds of pieces of the pentagon. But, None of the 757? I guess it vaporized at 500mph, or I guess they had to dispose of it right away like they had to do with bin laden's body! Yup, okkkkkkk like I'm a believer NOT!!!!

i seen the plane that hit the pentagon that day and still remember every detail also i lived in crystal city so not only did i witness this tragedy i also smelled the burning of fuels.
i was trapped on 95 as part of any morning commute into the city a low flying plane left Reagan airport this plane had a presidential seal on the tail end 2-5 minutes after that the commuter plane toppled along the grounds as it was breaking apart from striking the parking lot light's the the center section of the plane was still airborn from the momentum of being at full speed then colliding into the pentagon exploding its fuel stored in the belly of the aircraft no bull. got into the district to turn around men in full black fatigues appearing from hidden tunnels around the capital and white house along the green they appeared from nowhere.

Where's the engines, wings, body of the plane? In any plane crash there are RECOGNIZABLE pieces of plane debris. That was not the case at the Pentagon because there was no 757. It was an unmanned aerial vehicle (a Global Hawk to be precise) which took over the 2 planes (remember there were no hijack signals) that crashed into the twin towers and then Global Hawk was directed into the Pentagon to destroy the evidence. Watch Zero Investigation Into 9/11. Stop drinking your fluoridated water and wake up!

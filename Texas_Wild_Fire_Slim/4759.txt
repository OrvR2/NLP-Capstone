Kim Gillihan: Thanks to your brother and all other fighting these fires!Fookie: Darla - I don't know the circumstances surrounding the offer of assistance by these good men.  However, it is very unusual for anyone to walk on to the scene of an emergency without belonging to an organization such as a CERT group or emergency service provider.  I hope these men will take the opportunity to join up with a local fire department, EMS provider or disaster service like Red Cross so that their expertise can best be utilized.Fookie: Texas-Fire does its best to provide accurate information that we glean from various sources.  The above story comes from KLTV, KYTX and www.cbs19.tvFookie: Try these links.  Second one is a good map.

http://tfsweb.tamu.edu/main/article.aspx?id=12888Yvonne Boehm: This is an excellent opportunity for our students to get a head start on a very promising and community based career.
Not only will they develop team building skills that will benefit them all their lives but it gives them the opportunity to earn college credit and have a worthwhile career choice.

Wish there had been something like this in place when my son graduated.

the vision should always be....how will up and coming entreprenuers start a business and be able to sustain a living........unless everyone decides somehow to put all the sources in use toward one purpose at the same time.......for instance in education...would it be better to educate in a stadium ...reaching out in one swoop....that would be efficient...not much difference like with sports gatherings.....

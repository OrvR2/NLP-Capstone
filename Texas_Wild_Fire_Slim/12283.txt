June 10, 2011 — BOERNE, Texas — Residents interested in learning how to better protect themselves from wildfires are invited to a town hall meeting next week in Boerne.The Firewise Town Hall Meeting is designed to help residents learn how to protect their homes and families by becoming “Firewise.” Representatives from Texas Forest Service and the Boerne Fire Department will be on hand to answer questions and provide tips.The meeting is set for 7 p.m. Thursday, June 16, 2011, at the Boerne Fire Station. Wildfires are considered a community-wide problem. More than 80 percent of wildfires in Texas occur within two miles of a community. And 90 percent of wildfires in Texas are started by people acting carelessly.Implementing simple suggestions — such as moving firewood away from your home and clearing the surrounding dead and dense vegetation — could end up saving not just your home, but your community.“This workshop will provide folks with information that will give their homes a better chance of surviving a wildfire,” said Jerry Williams, wildland urban interface specialist with Texas Forest Service. “It will help teach them what to do when a wildfire is approaching their community.”For more information, visit www.texasfirestorm.org or www.texasfirewise.org, or view the Firewise Town Hall Meeting - Boerne flyer.Firewise Town Hall Meeting – BoerneDate: Thursday, June 16, 2011Time: 7 p.m.Location: Boerne Fire Station, 726 North Main St., Boerne, Texas###Contact:Boerne Fire Chief Doug Meckel830-249-3644, dmeckel@ci.boerne.tx.usWriter: Holly Huffman, Communications Specialist979-458-6605, hhuffman@tfs.tamu.edu

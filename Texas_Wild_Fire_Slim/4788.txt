‘Biggest Loser’ Star in Critical Condition After FallBy Mike KrumboltzYahoo! Buzz LogPostsBy Mike Krumboltz | Yahoo TV – 17 hours ago

(Yahoo! Buzz) — Gossip site TMZ is reporting that Sam Poueu, a contestant from the ninth season of "The Biggest Loser," is in critical condition in a San Francisco hospital after falling several stories from a building a few days ago.
Poueu, who didn't win on "Biggest Loser" but was a fan favorite and lost 142 pounds during his run, is currently recovering in an intensive-care unit. TMZ writes that, according to sources, Poueu "suffered a pelvic injury, torn ligaments, a punctured lung, and a broken leg during the accident." The circumstances behind the fall remain unclear.
Immediately following TMZ's report, Web searches on the reality star shot up more than 1,000 percent. Related lookups on "sam poueu accident" and "sam poueu in icu" also posted significant gains.
Less than a year ago, Poueu was in the news for much happier reasons when he became engaged to fellow "Biggest Loser" star Stephanie Anderson. Anderson lost nearly 100 pounds while on the show.
See Sam counsel Season 11 contestant Austin in this clip:
 
Ashley Johnson, another contestant on "The Biggest Loser," wrote an update on Sam's condition on Facebook. "Sam Poueu is making great improvements every day! God is answering our prayers and Sam is fighting! Please keep the prayers coming. He is still in critical condition, but is fighting like hell and is impressing the doctors like he impressed all of us on The Biggest Loser!"
Poueu's cousin, Koli Palu, who competed with him on the show, also gave a heartening update, according to The Hollywood Gossip. "Sam Poueu has made serious improvement in the last few hours. He has become very responsive to [fiancée] Stephanie Anderson and his mother, squeezing their hands and kicking his feet. The head trauma has pretty much stabilized. He still has a long way to go, but thank you so much for your love and prayers."

First of all, he is not Hispanic.  He is an AMERICAN of, I believe, French Polynesian descent.  But does it really matter?  He is seriously hurt and people should be more compassionate!

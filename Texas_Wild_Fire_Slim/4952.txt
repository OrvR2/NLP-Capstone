What does it mean to be poor in America?By Zachary RothSenior National Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Zachary Roth | The Lookout – 15 hrs ago

AP Photo/Joe MarquetteWe learned Tuesday that a record number of Americans are living in poverty, and that the poverty rate--15.1 percent--rose for the fourth straight year.
But those raw numbers leave out some key details that can help us understand the fuller implications of how poverty affects individual Americans. For instance, how is poverty defined? What specific hardships do the poor suffer? And what does it mean to be poor in America today?
The Census Bureau defines as poor any individual living on an income of less than $11,139, or any family of four living on less than $22,314. But that measure, developed over 40 years ago, is inexact at best. It doesn't include non-cash benefits--things such as food and housing subsidies--that can play a key role in supporting families. Nor does the Census definition take into account the large differences in the cost of living in different part of the country, or expenses such as child-care.
So from the outset, we lack a fully accurate way of gauging Americans' true economic well-being. That's why the Census Bureau said in its report that it plans to unveil preliminary findings next month, derived from a new measurement that addresses some of the shortcomings in the current system.
 
More fundamentally, some argue that in today's economy, the very term "poverty" can be misleading. A report by the conservative Heritage Foundation notes that when most Americans hear the word, they think of people who routinely can't afford the basic staples of life: nutritious food, shelter and clothing. In reality, data from other federal surveys suggests that's not the case for most poor people. And thanks to steadily increasing living standards, many or most poor Americans have things such as internet service, cable TV and dishwashers--not luxuries, to be sure, but not the picture of destitution that the word poverty often brings to mind.
As the report's authors, Robert Rector and Rachel Sheffield put it: "[T]he actual standard of living of America's poor—in terms of amenities in the home, housing, food consumption, and nutrition—is far higher than expected."
Advocates for a greater focus on poverty acknowledge that basic  accuracy of the claim advanced by the authors of the Heritage report--that  standards of living for the poor are much higher than they were a few  decades ago, and better than many people imagine. But they also say this qualified account of what it means to be poor the doesn't tell  the whole story, either.
"It's important, but there's a lot more to say," Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution told The Lookout.
There's certainly plenty of evidence to suggest that, in spite of poor families' ready access to some consumer amenities, they can face severe challenges in meeting basic needs. According to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released this month, 14.5 percent of American households--more than 17.2 million households, in all--were defined as "food insecure" last year. That means that poor households lacked sufficient money or other resources to obtain access to adequate food supplies. Among those with incomes near or below the poverty line, rates of food insecurity were said to be "substantially higher."
As Rector noted in an interview with The Lookout, food insecurity doesn't necessarily mean that poor familiers were malnourished, because the problem may only have lasted a short time. Still, it's a hardship most better-off Americans don't imagine facing.
And access to the basic necessities isn't the only issue. "The poor compared with other groups in the United States have a much more difficult day-to-day existence," Haskins said. "We know that things like having your electricity turned off, not being able to make your house or car payments, having to double up and live with other people, that is much more frequent among the poor." Poverty also correlates closely with school dropout rates and teen pregnancy, Haskins added.
"This is not Bangladesh, but there still is a lot of misery," he said.
Haskins also noted that an array of government programs have helped ensured that the proportion of Americans in poverty isn't larger still. "Public policy does a hell of a lot for poor people," he said. "The poverty rate would be much higher [without such programs]" According to the Census Bureau report, Social Security and unemployment benefits alone kept 23.5 million Americans out of poverty.
Some argue that even if poor Americans are doing OK by some standards, that's no reason not to be concerned by a rising poverty rate. "If you compare the U.S. with people in the developing word, even Americans living in poverty are well off," said Isabel Sawhill, also of Brookings. "But I think the standards of your country matter."

And these statistical findings are prepared by those who have more than they need...our government. They make poor people. There is a food shortage right now in America because we are exporting food to other countries that are having food shortages. Don't forget that if they control the food supply, they can control populations of poor people, this has no effect on the wealthy.

I am in shock as I type this....What a spin. You are not as bad off as you think you are. I actually read them say that subsidies make it not as bad as all that. But wait, isn't part of the rhetoric of most conservatives(who this is aimed at...make them feel not so bad while they are on their yachts)  that we need to cut all those programs that help those lazy, poor people and make them work more. Oh no, not this spin...really. I am totally confused. Wake up the spin doctors are out in full force.  NotpoliticallyCorrect...did you read that part...that the reason they are not really as poor as we think is because they receive those subsidies.

Okay...I get it....So, the poor aren't poor enough to be poor. Reminds me of a sarcastic remark an attorney once made: "We have the best system in the world so we don't need to improve it. I guess they should just feel lucky they have a system at all". Does anyone get what I'm saying here?

I never expected to find myself in this situation. I have a Masters Degree and BA. I can't work full time because I am a stay home parent. When others say stick your kids in school and WORK, please realize half the problems we have now are because of 'lack of parental' supervision. Our kids need us, but the government and society do not recognize that being a parent, a good parent, and raising an intelligent citizen is hard work. In previous generations, you could live on one income. Even a so so job provided GOOD income. Times have changed. Yes, we chose to have a child. But even if I WANTED a full time job, they are hard to come by now. I don't BLAME anyone. I don't get any government help, either.

But please recognize (selfish people out there) not every under employed or unemployed person is a lazy slob. Realize you are BLESSED if you have had a really decent job for years.

Family of 4 living on $22,000 a year?    Laughable.    Wouldn't even be able to make my house payment with $22,000 a year.    People need to get a grip on having kids.    50% of the lower income earners in this country have bred themselves into the poor house.    With a few exceptions out of every 100..... most people in dire straights put themselves there with poor decisions either with Education, Finance, or Kids.

In a traditional refinance, insist on a good-faith estimate of the costs up front, before you give the lender a penny, search the web for "123 Refinance" I would strongly recommend them. They got me 2.891% rate! It is good to learn more about refi before doing it.

So being poor in America means that you have a cell phone, internet and cable people just don't want to live without these items so that they can actually afford to pay for food, rent, electricity, they let the rest of the tax payers support them. 

The worst thing our government has done was to keep entitlement programs running infinitely. Breaking up families so that the person receiving the "benefits" could get their check. This is very sick and has weakend families all over our country therefore strengthening a corrupt government and keeping the weak, lazy and infirm dependent on the work of everyone else.

poor in america means owning an iPhone, driving a car instead of trains, wearing A&F instead of old navy and eating in TGI fridays instead of Mcdonalds and living in Los Angeles. that's the poor in america. americans complain they are so poor, then why not check poor asians who live under bridges, eat trashed fastfood foods and no education.

an acquaintance of mine noticed that "only in America are the poor, fat" and there is a bit of truth in that but i would imagine it  is like that in other countries that have "higher standards" as well, but i really like what Greg commented on about what Winston Churchill said about one's situation being self imposed, he really nailed it and at the same time, there are so many variables to consider in what leads to poverty that we can hardly pass judgment , but who am i kidding, i do it everyday, shame on me

The poor in America are not poor!  You wanna see real poor, go to a country that does not have the services America does for its poor/unfortnate. You wont see them in cars, in section 8 housing, soup kitchens, food stamps, or wearing new clean clothes, etc..  So even the American poor should feel blessed for what they have and be motivated to do something, anything to better there situation.

Always the people that didn't lose their jobs talking nonsense that think people are using the system, a lot of people are out of work because of Bush and his Admin. Lets see how one of you do with no employment for 2 years, bet you will shut up and become humble to people that are going through this.

The problem is the sense of entitlement. The illegals are atleast willing to work the menial jobs. It's the African Americans with a sense of entitlement that need to be deported. A fresh black immigrant from Africa will work, but the African American will keep whining about slavery.

How about the Dad who gratefully pays child support and has his kids half the time? That guy is living lean, he gets only his divided income to support himself and his kids. No food stamps, no housing benefits just go to work, pay the money and be grateful you get that much time with your kids. Big night out...Redbox here we come

if you can afford food, clothing, and shelter, you're not poor, no matter how little you make.

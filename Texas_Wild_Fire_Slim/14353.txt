PPP (D) Poll: Turner (R)/Welprin (D) 47/41 in NY-09.

Posted on September 12, 2011 by admin 

 PPP spells it out , and it’s excellent news for Republican Bob Turner . Turner’s winning in a heavily Democratic district for two reasons: a huge lead with independents and a large amount of crossover support.  He’s ahead by 32 points at 58-26 with voters unaffiliated with either major party.  And he’s winning 29% of the Democratic vote, holding Weprin under 60% with voters of his own party, while losing just 10% of Republican partisans. PPP goes on to blame the President for this one (both candidates have positive favorable ratings, although Bob Turner’s is notably better).  To give you an thought of how terrible things are for Obama in NY-09, check this out: “Obama trails Mitt Romney 46-42 in a hypothetical match up in the district and leads Rick Perry only 44-43.”  It would seem that President Obama is highly unpopular with orthodox Jewish voters (Turner leads 56/39) and people who care about Israel (Turner leads there 71/22 ) right now.  Go figure. So… I am going to go out on a limb, here: DOOM. Moe Lane PS: Bob Turner for NY-09 .  DOOM or not, no time to get cocky.

Democrats: PASS THE SCHRODINGER’S JOB BILL!

Posted on September 12, 2011 by admin 

 President Barack Obama : Pass this jobs bill — pass this jobs bill, and starting tomorrow, small businesses will get a tax cut if they hire new workers or if they raise workers’ wages. The bill has not been written yet . Valerie Jarrett , senior White House adviser: Congress should pass this bill right now. Again, the bill has not been written yet . Huffington Post : During a time of national crisis, the president has submitted an urgently-needed jobs bill that is well within the mainstream for Republicans as well as Democrats. What part of THE BILL HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN YET is so hard to know? Certainly the GOP leadership understands the concept that a speech is not a bill, which is why they’ve requested Obama’s plot in a form that can be scored by the CBO . They’d also like the White House to stop playing demagogic games with those three free trade treaties and really submit them to Congress, assuming that the Huge Labor stooges currently holding them up have managed to do enough featherbedding. But that’s probably going to take actual Divine Intervention. Or possibly another six months of 9+ unemployment; it’s hard to tell what can penetrate this administration’s Nigh-Impervious Force-Field of Smug these days. But I digress: THE BILL HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN YET . Moe Lane ( crosspost )

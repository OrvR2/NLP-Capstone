Barry Friedman Ltd's upcoming exhibition 'Heavy Metal,' featuring Ingrid Donat, Juan and Paloma Garrido, and Hervé Wahlen, explores the weight of modernity from three distinct perspectives. 
Ingrid Donat turns patio furniture from a relaxation receptacle into a canvas; the textural pieces become both tribal and reptilian. Spanish silversmiths Juan and Paloma Garrido puzzle viewers with aesthetic Rubik's Cubes of structure and material. The sleek and fragmented designs "reflect their own edges and the surrounding world," according to Barry Friedman Ltd. Hervé Wahlen's manually-shaped copper forms exude mystery as secret doors and removable parts define enigmatic shapes, denying use and demandingyed, and interacting with the arrangement of their environment."
'Heavy Metal' will show at Barry Friedman Ltd, 515 West 26th Street, NY, Y 10001, from September 15 until October 29, 2011.

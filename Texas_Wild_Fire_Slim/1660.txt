Jeff Tweedy and his band Wilco have a new album coming out soon, but it's a song very different from the indie rocker's traditional ouvre that is creating some major buzz.
The Grammy winner appeared at a book launch party for author Dan Sinker's "The F***ing Epic Twitter Quest of Mayor Emanuel," took the stage, and recited a very haunted, confused version of the Black Eyed Peas' hit, "My Humps." 
Rahm Emanuel himself was in attendance, but no word yet on whether he was a fan of the reconfigured groove. 
For more on the party, click here.

				I just listen to some of Jeff Tweedy on You Tube.I thought his singing "My Humps" by The Black Eyed Peas " was a joke but this is how he really sings. He just plain sucks. I thought the idea of singing was to get girls. He just plain sucks. Jeff Tweedy says Bon Jovi ruined music what a joke.

				Dear Jasmine D - One request, the next time you capture ANYTHING that's suppose to be funny, could you PLEASE try not to laugh directly into the device your holding. Try turning your head away but still holding the whatever it is your holding.  You ruined the whole thing for me with your laugh and to me, IMO, it's very annoying to watch something with constant interrupti­ons, like an annoying laugh. Then at about 4:00 you really belt it out at which point I had to stop the video. With all that said, and with the distractio­ns, I can't comment on what I'm supposed to be commenting on. Jus’ sayin’ - No hurt feelings, ok.

				Not at all true.  "Hot Pants" by James Brown, same amount of soul, different era. "Shaft" by Issac Hayes (performed the very same way as this guy by Tony Randall).  Many more examples.  Try listening to soul music sometime.

				You're romanticiz­ing soul music.  That's because you'd like to pretend its from a period long ago, never to return.  But the truth is that everyone the world over listens to it, and buys it.  Those people hear its unmistakab­le influence in everything Will.I.Am does - especially on the BEP collaborat­ion with James Brown (remember him - the Godfather of SOUL?).   C&W - that's mainly a US thing.  Doesn't get much play or considerat­ion in the rest of the world.

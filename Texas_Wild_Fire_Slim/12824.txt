April 12, 2011 – MERKEL, Texas – Texas Gov. Rick Perry visited Texas Forest Service’s Incident Command Post in Merkel on Tuesday after taking an aerial tour of West Texas wildfire damage. Joined by Texas Forest Service Incident Commander Gary Bennett, Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd and Commissioner of Agriculture Todd Staples, Perry told Texas Forest Service he was proud of their recent response. Since the current wildfire season began on Nov. 15, more than 1 million acres have burned across the state – and 425,000 of those burned in the last seven days. “My hat’s off to these firefighters,” Perry said. “Thank you with all my heart.”Kidd said he was honored to be standing among those who coordinate the response efforts and fight the fires. A former firefighter himself, Kidd added, “There are so many volunteer firefighters out there doing this for the love of the game.”Bennett thanked the numerous state agencies that have offered personnel and resources to assist Texas Forest Service. “We’re making every effort to suppress these fires and protect homes and citizens,” he said.

Own a piece of reality show history with this Hollywood Boulevard bachelorette pad.
The 1920s Spanish-style home, on the market for $2.25 million, has four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and boasts 3,000 square feet of living space. Other features include a heated pool, a guest house and a basement (uncommon in Los Angeles). But what puts this property ahead of the pack is the home's reality show pedigree. 
Owned by Lauren Conrad (that's "LC" to you), the home has been the immaculately staged backdrop for the gossip sessions, tearful confessions, and uncomfortably intimate moments that made up MTV's 'The Hills.' The reality show focused on Conrad and her friends (Whitney Port, Audrina Patridge, and Heidi Montag) as they navigated their way through work, life and love in Los Angeles. 
Realtor.com notes: Fans of “The Hills” will be interested to know that the property includes the guest house Audrina Partridge lived in during part of the show’s run and, of course, the pool in which Audrina and Justin Bobby famously swam together.
Conrad bought the home in the summer of 2008 -- right around the time filming for the fourth season of 'The Hills' began. At the time, she ponied up $2,360,000 for the home, according to Real Estalker, which means Conrad is prepared to lose at least $11,000 on this new deal. Don't weep for her though; life post-reality show has been good for LC. With three books (some of which are NY Times best sellers), a clothing collection at Kohl's department store, and too many endorsement deals to count, we're guessing she can take the hit.

				I blame every single person who watched that show for this. You all deserve to live in single run down apartments while this chick got this house. Stop watching these damn shows and watch cartoons for crying out loud. I say cartoon because I am sure you don't own a copy of War and Peace.

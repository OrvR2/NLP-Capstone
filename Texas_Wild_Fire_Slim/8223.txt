Clinton talks to Abbas over Palestinian UN bidAFP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke Tuesday with Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas ahead of a showdown over the Palestinians' controversial bid for UN membership, the State Department said.
The Palestinians are expected to make their bid later this month before the United Nations General Assembly -- a move Washington opposes. The US is seeking to set up a new round of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.
Clinton urged Abbas "to work hard with us to avoid a negative scenario in New York at the end of the month," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said.
Abbas will Wednesday meet with US Middle East envoy David Hale, and Clinton called on the Palestinian leadership to "hear him with open ears" as Washington hopes to avert a potentially rancorous UN meeting.
White House spokesman Jay Carney meanwhile said the Palestinian effort was "not productive or helpful," telling reporters that peace needed to be "negotiated directly by both parties."
Making the UN membership bid without a peace plan in place would "not bring the Palestinians any closer to statehood," he said.
Washington is said to be seeking to draft a proposal for peace talks that will be acceptable to Israel, as well as Russia, the European Union and the UN -- the other members of the international peacemaking Quartet.
"We are going to continue to work right up until the UN General Assembly, if necessary, to get these parties back to the table, and we'll continue to work afterwards," Nuland said of US efforts.
US diplomatic efforts are focused on including a number of countries in the region to help deter the Palestinians' move toward seeking unilateral statehood.
"We have been talking in diplomatic channels... to a much broader section of countries than we usually talk to about Middle East peace, because many of them who don't usually get confronted with decisions like this could be confronted with a decision in the General Assembly," she said.
Direct talks between Israel and Palestinians came to a halt shortly after they were relaunched in Washington last September over the issue of settlement construction.
The Palestinians refuse to resume talks while Israel builds in annexed Arab east Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied West Bank.

The Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini was later the notorious Nazi who mixed Nazi propaganda and Islam.  He was wanted for war crimes in Bosnia by Yugoslavia.  His mix of militant propagandizing Islam was an inspriation for both Yasser Arafat and Saddam Husein: He was also a close relative of Yasser Arafat and grandfather of the current Temple Mount Mufti. "Arafat's actual name was Abd al-Rahman abd al-Bauf Arafat al-Qud al-Husseini. He shortened it to obscure his kinship with the notorious Nazi and ex-Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Muhammed Amin al-Husseini..  The Bet Agron International Center in Jerusalem interviewed Arafat's brother and sister, who described the Mufti as a cousin (family member) with tremendous influence on young Yassir after the Mufti returned from Berlin to Cairo. Yasser Arafat himself keeps his exact lineage and birthplace secret.  Saddam Hussein was raised in the house of his uncle Khayrallah Tulfah, who was a leader in the Mufti's pro-Nazi coup in Iraq in May 1941.

Can't this conflict just end? As an American Jew, I find this to be simple, yes a simple solution. Israel, no more settlements in disputed territories. Palestinians, stop the God-Damn rockets every week or no, you will not look like a people ready for their own nation. Enough of choosing one side or another in this pointless conflict. Just learn to co-exist, jeez.

H. Clinton wants to avoid a "negative scenario in New York."  But when has there ever been a positive scenario for Palestinians in New York or anywhere else in the United States?  They have nothing to lose at this point.  Time to stand up and assert their identity.

Palestinian history fabricated 
 All Media  
    Video  




Rewriting history 
Rewriting the history of the Land of Israel in order to deny Israel's right to exist is central to Palestinian Authority (PA) policy. Long before it started the Terror War in 2000, the PA was fighting a history war – erasing Jewish history and replacing it with a fabricated Palestinian history. This rewriting has two central goals: 
1- Erase the Jewish nation's 3,000 year history in the Land of Israel;
2- Invent ancient Palestinian, Muslim and Arab histories in the land.

The goal of this historical revision as a political strategy was first expressed publicly at a conference of Palestinian historians in 1998, when rewriting history was linked to the political goal of denying Israel's right to exist: 
"Dr. Yussuf Alzamili [Chairman History Department, Khan Yunis Educational College] called on all universities and colleges to write the history of Palestine and to guard it, and not to enable the [foreign] implants and enemies to distort it or to legitimize the existence of Jews on this land... [History lecturer Abu Amar] clarified that there is no connection between the ancient generation of Jews and the new generation." [Al-Ayyam, Dec. 4, 1998].

Erasing Jewish history in the land of Israel is followed by the PA’s invention of ancient and modern histories that support its political ideology and claim to the land of Israel. The Holocaust and other aspects of Jewish history are alternately denied, downplayed or distorted. Another distortion is to hide from Palestinians that Jesus was a Jew who lived in the Land of Judea/Israel. PA leaders repeatedly define Jesus as a Palestinian who preached Islam, thus denying not only Jewish history, but also the history and legitimacy of Christianity.

Citing numerous examples, this section will document that these and other historical revisions are an integral part of Palestinian policy and are used to create political ideology.

Yiddish is a culmination of Hebrew, German, and Polish.  The Jews as you have pointed out are able to evolve.

It is not "Arab east Jerusalem". Jews also live in the eastern part of Jerusalem and there are sites important and holy to Jews as well in this part of the city.

The worst aspect of this bid for statehood is the bad publicity for Israel.  Israel is now held up to scrutiny.  Perhaps some of the lethargic, apathetic hoi polloi are even asking some pointed questions as to who are these "Pakistinians" and what do they mean by "occupation" and "settlements" and "checkpoints."  The Palestinians are behaving like diplomats.  They are not running around in turbans, wielding scimitars and screaming "Allahu akbar," like in the cartoons.  They are wearing suits.  They actually seem human.  Woe unto Israel!

@Caius, I'm still awaiting for your response for this post: 

The J2 Haplogroup is originated in the Fertile Crescent, and thus all the people belonging to this Y-DNA can be said to be the indigenous people of the Fertile Crescent. The frequency of this Haplogroup among the so-called Palestinians is, as far as I can remember, 13%. This does not mean that they are descendants of people living in Palestine. They can be from Iraq, Egypt, Syria, etc. The frequency of this very Haplogroup among Ashkenazic Jews is, as far as I can remember, 23%. Unlike the so-called Palestinians, we can safely say that those Jews are not only descendants of people from the Fertile Crescent, but most importantly that they are descendants of the ancient Israelites. Ashkenazic Jews born in Europe are more entitled to this land than those Arabs calling themselves in a name others coined.

@Paul, Israel's racism towards Palestinians includes institutionalised and systematic methods of racism. As regards Palestinians inside Israel, racism is prevalent in many institutions including the government, legislature, judiciary, army and religious bodies, and institutions that emphasise the State's national-religious character as being exclusively Jewish, to the exclusion of its non-Jewish inhabitants. Disciminatory laws and policies have been adopted encompassing issues such as land and housing, citizenship, political participation, culture, language, education, religious rights, and other social, economic and employment rights. It has involved the denial of crucial services to the so-called unrecognised villages.

yiddish did use the hebrew alphabet, but IT WAS A GERMANIC LANGUAGE...  further evidence of a mass conversion of a people with no written language.

no yiddish is a unique language, it is a germanic language, but it is not german... it is a unique language...

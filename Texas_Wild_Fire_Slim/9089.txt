NBC’s Andrea Mitchell: I have breast cancerBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – 8 hrs ago


Andrea Mitchell, NBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent and host of an eponymous MSNBC show, announced on Wednesday that she has breast cancer.
The 64-year-old Mitchell made the announcement at the end of her show, "Andrea Mitchell Reports."
"And now a personal note, or how I spent my summer vacation: I had planned to be hiking in Wyoming last week," Mitchell said, "but instead discovered that I am now among the one in eight women in this country--incredibly, one in eight--who've had breast cancer."
"Mine was discovered during my annual screening just a short time ago," she continued. "Luckily for me, I'm one of the fortunate ones. We discovered it in the earliest stage, it had not spread, and I'm already back at work with a terrific prognosis."
Mitchell urged female viewers to get screened.
"I'm looking at this as another of life's lessons," she said. "For you women out there and for the men who love you, screening matters. Do it."

My best friend ,she just has announced her wedding with a millionaire man! They met via SearchⱤichṢingles.CȯṀ ..it is the largest and best club for millionaires and their admirers to chat online. …You do not have to be rich or famous, but you may meet one. It's worth a try!

It is amazing how many ignorant people posted comments. They feel they own the road

and no one should be on it except them. These are the clowns that make our roads unsafe.

It is a very sad thing to see such a high rate of this cancer. To bad many who may have it will never know till its to late sure wish everyone one had health care or lots of money. What would be great is to urged female viewers to vote for better fordable health care then many more just may be so lucky. Free screenings are no good without health insurance

Wow there are some hateful people out there. She's using her position to raise awareness, such a bad thing to do huh.  So she's a liberal and she deserves cancer and so do others.  She must be the devil seeing she didn't thank god.  You are  people are the reason this country is in such bad shape. When did we stop caring about others????

I am sorry to hear about her cancer...however I am tired of hearing JUST about breast Cancer...My sister just finished cancer treatment for Tongue Cancer. The death rate for oral cancer is higher than that of cancers which we hear about routinely such as cervical cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, laryngeal cancer, cancer of the testes, and endocrine system cancers such as thyroid, or skin cancer (malignant melanoma). Lets not focus on just one cancer all the time..Lets make sure everyone is aware of all the different cancers that can affect us.

My mother is going through her second bout with breast cancer, and my grandmother has fought it twice as well. I just can't believe some of the posts on here that are turning this into a political thing. It's truly disgusting how people can act.

I knew it was some sorry human beings that walk this planet, but to wish bad things on a person who has Cancer, I don't care who they are is just plain mean. It is not one single thing funny about Ms. Mitchell situation. But you know what God has a way of bringing people to their knees, when they start making fun of sick people.  Whoever is making fun of this situation need to drop RIGHT NOW and ask God to forgive them. Now I know somebody is going to put a label on me, a right wing crazy, but you could not be more wrong.

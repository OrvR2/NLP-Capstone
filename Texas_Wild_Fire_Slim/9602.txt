10 Necessities For A Home Based Business

Posted on 11/09/2011 by admin 

When you make the decision to earn income from the internet you will need to go through a set up process to be ready for business.

Following are the basic steps in setting up for home business success.

1. Attitude

The key to your business success is your attitude.

Treat your business like a business.

This is critical whether you are working part-time or full-time. One of my colleagues is a mother who works from home around her family. She has always put her family first whilst at the same time developing her business. She says, “I work part-time, but I have a full-time attitude.”

Put another way, “If you have a hobby attitude you will have a hobby income, if you have a business attitude you will have a business income.”

You can be successful working part-time and you can be successful working full-time but it is highly unlikely that you will be successful working in your “spare time”.

2. Working Environment

A space that you can call your own, free from distractions for your scheduled time.

A comfortable chair and organized desk.
Stationery supplies as required. For example:

- pens
- highlighters
- stapler
- hole punch
- sticky tape
- note book(s)
- a simple filing system
- ring binders
- manilla folders

Consider the value of a broadband connection. Your time is valuable and a broadband connection can allow you to get more done in a given time frame.

3. Schedule

Develop a schedule that works for you, your family (or “significant others”) and your business. When you allot a block of time for work then use that time for work. Equally important is to schedule time for your other commitments – family time, self education ( reading, listening and viewing), “health time” (exercise, cooking and eating), and leisure time. During these other times don’t work. After all if one of the reasons to work from home is to spend more time with your family then you don’t want your working at home time to consume your family time.

You are working for yourself and your schedule (by your choice) is your “boss”. When you have people calling you or dropping around unexpectedly or maybe out-of-town visitors may want to catch up with you then you need to make a choice. Are you committed to your own business success? What will be your choice in these situations? Only you can decide what is important to you.

In a family environment you may need to negotiate with your partner and children to have your business time agreed upon, during which you will not be interrupted. Put this schedule prominently somewhere so all family members are aware of your work schedule.

4. Describe Your Business

Be able to describe your business concisely; a powerful one or two sentence description that someone can repeat in describing your business to others. A unique and memorable tag line can also be invaluable for promoting your business.

5. Know Your Product or Service

Once you have selected your product or service to sell, it may or may not be something that you use yourself but you need to know your product intimately. If you are selling ebooks then know the content and its value. If you are selling software then use it know it “inside out”. You will develop a reputation of providing quality information and because of your product knowledge you can become the preferred supplier.

It is not practical to use certain products (for example a woman may choose to sell man’s shoes or vice versa) in which case the seller won’t be a product user, however the seller can still know the benefits and features of the product intimately.

6. Administration

Use good record keeping practices.

This may involve a consultation with a tax advisor who can let you know about the optimal way to set up your financial records and what records need to be kept. Your advisor will also recommend record keeping systems and you can find out what software may simplify this aspect of your business. Additionally your obtain advice on the best arrangement for your bank accounts. You will most likely be advised to have a separate bank account.

You will also need to keep track of your various logins, usernames and passwords. A very handy little software tool for this is Treepad available as either the free Lite version (without password protection) or the commercial Plus or Biz versions. http://www.treepad.com

There are other useful tools for this also from a simple paper notebook to free and commercial password keepers. One popular solution is Roboform that will remember your login details and can automatically fill out your login and other registration forms. http://www.roboform.com

7. Computer Protection

Your computer is the lifeline to your business dealings and must be protected including the data that is stored.

You need a virus scanner, personal firewall, anti-spyware and anti-adware and preferably an email scanner with the ability to delete suspect of spam email from the server before it is downloaded to your computer.

Some suggestions are:

AVG Anti-Virus: http://www.grisoft.com
Spybot SD: http://www.safer-networking.org
Microsoft Anti-Spyware:
www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx
Adaware: http://www.lavasoft.com/
Mailwasher Email Scanner: http://www.mailwasher.net

8. A Domain Name

You will most likely need a domain name for your business and one cost effective registrar is GoDaddy, http://www.godaddy.com.

9. Payment Processing

You will need a way to process credit cards; that may be using services such as:
- PayPal https://www.paypal.com
- Storm Pay http://www.stormpay.com
- 2 Checkout http://www.2checkout.com
- Clickbank http://www.clickbank.com or others.

This is the most economical way to get started. Once your business picks up you may need to look into your own merchant account for credit card transactions.

Consideration may also be given to other forms of online currency such as eGold http://www.egold.com

10. Email accounts

Once you have your own domain you can use an associated email account. This can further assist in the promotion of your business and promotes a more professional business image.

As a final comment on continuing in your internet business, conduct your business ethically, provide extraordinary service and be proud to put your name to the products or services that you are selling and you will be on track to developing a sustainable long term internet business.

Following these tips, you can increase targeted website traffic for your business’s website. Good luck!

Strengthen the connection between your networks. Now that you have them on your side, make sure you’ll not lose them again. Send them emails about your product or service once a month to keep them in touch. This also calls for regular development on your product or service.

Update your website regularly. You know how people depend on the Internet. Make sure you add or update features in your website that will make your customers think your company is developing fast.

Involve your company with the current trends in your field. You can connect the importance of your product with the trending news and public affairs events. You can also share your opinion on current issues. Try everything to keep up with the events around your market. That will bring more traffic to website and will help you also in building your network.

Car Longevity: A Serious Car Matter

Posted on 11/09/2011 by admin 

Automobiles can cost a lot, especially luxury cars with advanced features that sell for millions of dollars. A car is considered by many to be a lifetime investment. Aside from the actual price of the vehicle, an owner will have to continuously shell out money for gas and maintenance as long as he or she is using it.

Because of a car’s operating costs, most owners go to great lengths to keep their units up and running for as long as possible. They do regular maintenance checks and at the first sign of trouble, they take their cars for repairs.

Car longevity is something that many car enthusiasts take very seriously. The service life of an automobile can be calculated in terms of the number of miles it has covered. Generally, the average lifespan of a car in miles is said to be between 165,000 to 200,000 miles. On the other hand, the average lifespan of a car in years is said to be 13 years. However, the mileage and age limits may vary from car to car.

There are many factors that affect the service life of an automobile. These include car usage, maintenance, traveled miles, and the normal wear and tear of the car body. These factors should be kept in mind by potential clients of the used car dealerships Chicago and other states have.

There are ways to increase a used car’s service years, and most of these methods fall in the hands of the new owner. One has to observe certain precautions, such as regularly monitoring the car fluids used. Oil should also be changed regularly. Rust is a major threat, so one has to keep corrosion problems from damaging the automobile. Although most used car dealers in Chicago and other areas first carefully inspect their pre-owned products before putting them up for sale, it is the buyer’s duty to keep his or her purchase in shape.

For those who are considering secondhand vehicles, it is essential to learn about the history of the car they want to buy. Reliable used car dealers in Chicago and other states will readily provide the necessary information. If a car has an excellent maintenance background, chances are it will last longer than a unit that does not.

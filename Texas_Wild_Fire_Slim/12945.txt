All celestial bodies are so far away, and it takes their light so long to reach us, that all we see are their old pictures! That supernova could already be gone, and we are still watching it's demise.

you can tell how old it is by examining where it originates and comparing that data to how bright or close it is. Light travels. fast, but it still travels. that is how measure the distance of EACH star. your seein lights that could actually be out by now but the light hasnt reached earth yet. Technically half the universe could be a bunch of exploded supernova stars and we wont know untill we can actuallt begin to see them. by which time it shall be too late unfortunatley.

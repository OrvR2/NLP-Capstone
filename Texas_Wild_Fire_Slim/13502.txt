Progress Made in Texas Wildfire, DC-10 Ready

 BASTROP, Texas --
A fire official said there was no immediate need early Friday for crews to launch the biggest aerial assault yet of a massive wildfire that has raged across Central Texas, destroying nearly 1,400 homes and tens of thousands of acres of drought-parched land.
Officials had planned to deploy a converted DC-10 jetliner capable of dropping 12,000 gallons of fire retardant on the blaze and smoldering hotspots across some 45 square miles in and around Bastrop. But Texas Forest Service incident manager Bob Koenig said doing so was not immediately necessary.
The plane is ready to fly, but "if there's no operational need it will stay where it's at," Koenig said.
Retardant is dropped to help make flames shorter and smaller, allowing firefighters on the ground to make headway. Crews have said they've made steady progress against the Bastrop-area blaze, have closed in around its biggest flames and are focusing on hotspots with ground crews.
Concern lingers, however, about wind sparking flare-ups or fanning flames outside the area. Koenig said the DC-10 could now be used anywhere in the state should the need arise.
Firefighters from the across the country, meanwhile, continue to poor into Bastrop. Koenig said there are 844 firefighters on the fire line with more arriving all the time.
The Bastrop-area fire has been the most catastrophic of nearly 180 wildfires the forest service says erupted across Texas this week. The outbreak has left nearly 1,700 homes statewide in charred ruins, killed four people and forced thousands of people to evacuate.
Federal forest service officials earlier this week contacted 10 Tanker Air Carrier LLC, of Victorville, Calif., which leases the DC-10 to the U.S. Forest Service and states as needed. The state asked that the company "ferry it as quickly as possible" to Texas, which also used the tanker in the spring, said CEO Rick Hatton.
The massive plane arrived Tuesday night in Austin, about 25 miles west of the blaze, but could not be used until Friday as crews worked to set a temporary plumbing system to funnel retardant into the plane, said Texas Forest Service spokeswoman Holly Huffman.
Huffman said Texas has retardant plants in place at airports other than Austin, but runways at those sites are neither approved to handle such a large aircraft nor as close to the Bastrop blaze. She said the DC-10 - which costs the state $12,000 per flight hour as well as a $45,000 per day availability fee - would have been used in addition to smaller aircraft that have been flying since the fire broke out Sunday.
"These tankers aren't magic tools, rather they help to slow down and cool down the fire," she said. "Ground resources still have to go in and contain and extinguish the fire."
Some of the 5,000 Bastrop-area residents forced to flee their homes amid the fire said they wished the state could have gotten more resources earlier in the week.
"Maybe it could have speeded the process up," said Bruce Anderson, a welder who left his home Sunday. "We definitely needed more help a few days ago."
Officials on Thursday allowed some of the evacuated residents to return to neighborhoods that are no longer considered threatened, including hundreds of homes in Tahitian Village. Most there appeared untouched, but the pockets of destruction were complete.
Mary Pierce, who for 22 years lived on a quiet street where pines push up into backyards, stared in disbelief Thursday at her foundation, where all that stood was a brick facade and a chimney. Lumped metal appliances suggested a kitchen or laundry room; a metal bed frame, a bedroom.
"When they say things burn to the ground, they really mean burn to the ground," said Pierce, who was one of only two residents to lose a home on her block.

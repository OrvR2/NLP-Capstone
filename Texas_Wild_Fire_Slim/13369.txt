Fourth-Place Medal 
Thu Sep 08 12:36pm EDT
Belarusian long jumper loses meet because of her ponytail By      Chris Chase




Nastassia Mironchyk-Ivanova literally lost the world championships by a hair.
The Belarusian long jumper would have won the gold medal in last week's competition in Daegu, South Korea, had it not been for her long ponytail that hit the pit and was used as her measurement. New photographic evidence (above) shows how close her hair was to missing the pit. Because the rear mark is used, the point where Mironchyk-Ivanova's ponytail hit the sand is where her measurement was made.
New photographic evidence shows how close the jumper came to winning gold.
That ended up being six inches behind the rest of her body. Mironchyk-Ivanova was credited with a 22-foot, 1 ½-inch jump, three inches behind the eventual winner, Britney Reese.
Mironchyk-Ivanova's hairstyle cost her one of the most prestigious gold medals in track and field. She also lost out on a $45,000 bonus for a victory.
It should be noted that Reese, the American who won gold, had her hair in a bun.
Thanks, Larry Brown Sports

1 users disliked this comment Truck 10 hours ago Report Abuse This competition, is after all, about who can jump the furthest, and the answer here is obvious to anyone with even half a brain kicking around up there. In other word if they were jumping across a cliff and the gap was 22ft 1 1/2" + the 6" in question, guess who would have made it across and guess who wouldn't have. Then, I can assure you, there would be no debate at all.

Thank you   :-)

1 users disliked this comment Truck 10 hours ago Report Abuse Considering this is a long jump competition, the question ultimately is...who jumped further? the answer is clear, regardless of how you wanna look at it. In other words if they were jumping across a cliff with gap of 22ft, 1 1/2" + the 6" in question....guess who would have made it and who would not have. Then there would be no debate at all :-)
 Thank you.

1 users disliked this comment rob 14 hours ago Report Abuse Some rules are questionable .... but if her hair made an "imprint" in the sand then that's the spot that the officials must   measure the distance to.   What a rotten way to lose a for sure Gold medal.

3 users disliked this comment Jim 17 hours ago Report Abuse Well, just read one on Serena Williams latest tantrum. There was no space for comments, so I'll do it here where hopefully American sports fans might spot it. Williams called the Aussie Line ump a hater, unattractive on the inside, called her the same one who penalized one of her other diatribes. This large, muscular female tennis player has a little too much testosterone in her system; causing her to lean towards intimidation, as if she may physically attack this official. She says "this is America", well if this is America, its pathetic. She has a sense of entitlement because officials have put up with her ugly and abusive nature before. She is unattractive, and she is the same idiot she was before. So daddy Williams, check out what constitutes civilized behaviour, and then pass it on to her, because she doesnt even recognize how egregious hers is.

4 users disliked this comment Sneaks 19 hours ago Report Abuse Absurd, she clearly outjumped the "Gold Medalist"

And of course, Chris Chase, behind yet another misleading Title, she lost by a ponytail you @#$%, not A hair.

Seriously, this guy is a joke. I'd love to meet him face to face, just to slap him for being so stupid.

YAHOO!!!! Get rid of Chris Chase

4 users disliked this comment duncan_wagner 20 hours ago Report Abuse This was the right call. Your hair is part of your body and as such should be included in the determination of distance in a long jump. Perhaps a bun would be better than a pony tail.

3 users disliked this comment Observer 20 hours ago Report Abuse The ponytail is attached to her body; no different to count that than it would be if her hand went back. Body is body. Unfortunate, but rules are rules. Shot putters' toes can't touch the circle at all; this isn't an argument either.

3 users disliked this comment gregpmorris 21 hours ago Report Abuse This is the right call for a number of reasons. The main reason being that the sand mark and the take off board provide accurate measurement making it fair and not open to interpretation like in figure skating. Rules are rules. The jumper knew this. In high jump or pole vault if the athlete knocks the bar off with their hair the jump still counts? No way. The comments below are ridiculous. Rules are rules as unfortunate as this situation is.

2 users disliked this comment TEAM_SARCASM 23 hours ago Report Abuse Lame call.. As frustrating as it must have been to lose this way, think if how the gold medal winner Britney Reese feels having won only by three inches after seeing the photo finish and realizing that the pony tail was at least 12" long.... Britney, you won purely on chance and based on a ridiculous rule.   It wasn't your athletic ability it was a bad hair day...

Top girls hoops prospect shot dead in NYC housing project By      Cameron Smith


In a tragic turn of events on the 10th anniversary of the most tragic day in New York City history, one of the top girls basketball prospects in the nation was gunned down in her Manhattan housing project in an incident that family members and friends contend was a horrific case of mistaken identity.

According to the New York Daily News, New York Post, ESPN New York and a variety of other sources, 18-year-old Tayshana Murphy (who was nicknamed Chicken), was shot and killed in Harlem's Grant Houses housing project around 4:10 a.m. on Sunday morning. The Daily News reported that friends and at least one witness told officials that she was attempting to out run a gunman in a hallway of her building when she was killed.
Murphy, a 5-foot-6 senior at New York (N.Y.) Murry Bergtraum High, was considered one of the top guard prospects in the nation and had received recruiting interest from a variety of collegiate programs. The teen planned to use her basketball talents to improve her future and help her family leave the projects which eventually claimed her life.
Yet the circumstances around her shooting are so tragic and troubling that they may threaten to overshadow many of the accomplishments of her bright life. According to the Daily News, Murphy was wearing a hooded sweatshirt at a party with friends from her project when she was chased by the gunman in question. According to some who were at the party, Murphy was mistaken by her assailant "for a boy from the group who had fought with young men from a nearby housing project," and she protested her innocence to the gunman.
"She was pleading for her life," Teka Taylor, one of Murphy's close friends, told the Daily News. "She was saying, 'No, please, I don't have nothing to do with it.'"

Murphy's mother, Tephanie Holston, was interviewed hours after her daughter's death wearing a shirt stained with blood from her daughter's wounds. Still coming to grips with the full gravity of her loss, Holston told the Daily News just how important basketball was to her daughter.
"She said, 'Mom, I'm going to get you out of the projects,' " said Murphy's mother, Tephanie Holston, whose shirt was stained with blood after she tried to save her daughter before emergency workers arrived. "She loved basketball, she lived and breathed basketball," Holston said.

Her coach said that his team would miss their would-be senior star even more than she could miss the game itself.
"It's very devastating, it's something you never want to deal with," Murry Bergtraum girls basketball coach Ed Grezinsky told ESPN New York. "You deal with all kinds of things and adversity as a coach, injuries and all kinds of family issues, but something like this is beyond comprehension.
"Somebody that is young like that and has everything to live for and has everything in front of her, she was very much looking forward to this season. She had [torn] her ACL last year and I spoke to her last week and I said 'Are you ready for this season?' and she said 'I can't wait.'"

When the day arrives that blacks...turn their backs on N-GG-ers and shun the N-gg-ers representatives...the Jacksons, The sharptons, the FarrakCONS...

That is the day when the rest of society lends a helping hand....till then like the muzzys...you will all be lumped into the same mold.

0 users disliked this comment agree66 5 minutes ago Report Abuse In a case such as that, I bet the maggot who did the killing will get a life sentence and get out in 10 to 12 years.   What is a life sentence anyway?   What needs to be done is put the SOB in prison and let the inmates pass judgement on him and kill him.   Why do tax paying citizens have to pay for food and shelter for skum like that anyway.

1 users disliked this comment Taylor13 10 minutes ago Report Abuse This is being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't see why people think they have the right to take someone else life away. For you to sit there point the gun at someone and then watch and listen to her beg right in front of you. Come on now. No one has that right. She was killed for no reason. She could have made it big time in this life. Rest In Peace   Tayshana "Chicken" Murphy may you play basketball on the clouds of heaven. Watch and pray over your family that they can get out of the projects.

2 users disliked this comment Tara 17 minutes ago Report Abuse When I read this story, I felt sadness.   I didn't think about the victims race, or sex, or where she was killed.   None of that matters.   Someone lost their child. That is the ONLY thing that matters.   Someone, a fellow human being and American is gone from this earth because some jerk decided that to take a life.
It saddens me even more that several of these comments speak in such a mean spirited, even racist way, about black people. It is almost as if   black people are a separate species or entity than non blacks.   It's so ridiculous!   

Part of the comment by 'letsgotrippin' said,   "...will blacks ever cultivate the moral courage to fix their broken culture?..."    Excuse me?   If you live in America, you can see that the entire culture is broken, not just one particular sub culture.   There are several things that happen everyday by non black Americans that are just as horrible as what happened to Tayshana.   We all need to work on fixint the country as a whole.   Comments like the one I quoted are part of the problem, not the solution.

"why was she out at 4 am" "look at the necklaces she wore" "look at the tattoo" who the hell cares? she was at a party, she was mistaken for someone else. the was shot in the hallway of her bldg. if she was white you morons would be yelling about the black animals and how they do this all the time..or if she was white it wouldn't make the news. how can you be so cold hearted to the killing of an innocent victim? it's a shame you were raised by mentalyy challenged inbred trailer dwellers who didn't get any where in life and blamed the blacks the jews the hispanics and anyone else that made an effort to suceed

10 users disliked this comment Please  1 hour ago Report Abuse Black people think life is a game. They think life is a joke. Blacks don't look out for each other, like they used to. Blacks are killing each other and thats what white people want. Whites want to be like us, listen to our music, dress like us and they think it's cool. In reality, whites are laughing at us and mocking us, because we act like idiots and animals. Blacks need to understand life is short.   Blacks need to understand, when blacks kill each other, white people laugh at us, because it shows how stupid and retarded we are.

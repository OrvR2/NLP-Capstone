Scandinavian food, dances at vineyard's Midsummer Fest
By Amy Starnes
Tehuacana Creek Vineyards is holding its 9th annual Midsummer Fest on Saturday, filled with Swedish folk dancers, Scandinavian music and traditional food to go along with, of course, the wine.

The event celebrates the Scandinavian holiday Midsummer, generally the summer solstice or longest day of the year.

The winery, 6826 E. Highway 6, is open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday, but will feature Swedish folk dances around a maypole at 1 p.m., performed by the Lindsborg Swedish Folk Dancers from Lindsborg, Kansas. 

Traditional Scandinavian food as well as Tehuacana Creek wine will be available for purchase. Entry into the event is free. For more information, see the vineyard's website.

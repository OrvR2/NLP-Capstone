Texas wildfires claim 700 homes, force evacuationsAFP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

Crews in Texas Tuesday battled dozens of wildfires that have destroyed more than 700 homes in just two days and forced thousands to flee thick smoke and flames.
"This is one of the meanest fires I've ever seen," Texas Governor Rick Perry told reporters after an aerial tour of the homes destroyed in the Steiner Ranch subdivision.
"The magnitudes of these losses are pretty stunning." 
The Republican White House hopeful had been campaigning in South Carolina ahead of a major debate on Wednesday night when the fires swept through subdivisions and towns near the state capitol of Austin.
He bowed out of several events so he could survey the damage and meet with evacuees.
The fires have been fanned by winds from a tropical depression that hit the southern United States over the weekend and have flared across ground left tinder dry by an intense summer drought, killing at least two people.
The worst blaze remains uncontrolled after devouring 30,000 acres (47 square miles or 121 square kilometers) and nearly 600 homes in Bastrop county, prompting mass evacuations as weather forecasts suggested the situation would get worse before it gets better.
More than 250 fire personnel battled the blaze in Bastrop, with planes and helicopters dumping water from above, but across the state the crews struggled to refill at lakes and rivers drained by the long, hot drought.
"There's practically a fleet of aircraft in the air," said Jan Amen, a Forest Service spokeswoman in Bastrop. "Problem is, we have to share them with other fires because there's so many burning in the area."
In East Texas, a fast-moving fire is believed to have killed a 20-year-old woman and her child, who failed to get out of their trailer home fast enough.
Gregg County Sheriff Maxey Cerliano told reporters the victims were found dead near Gladewater, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east of Fort Worth.
 Firefighters have responded to 181 blazes that have burned more than 118,000 acres in the past week, according to the latest situation report from the Texas Forest Service.
More than 3.5 million acres -- about the size of the state of Connecticut -- have been burned by 18,719 blazes since the wildfire season began in December.
Officials have ruled out arson as the cause of the fires and instead blame Tropical Depression Lee, which  was graded as a more serious tropical storm when it came ashore in southern Louisiana early Sunday.

It's funny how when the tables are turned and the conservatives get a taste of hardship, they turn around and start crying that libs are being mean to them... LOL!  Hypocrisy at its finest when they turn into the people that they were told to hate!

Unfortunately us Christians are stuck living in a sinful world with the rest of you non-believers if it rains on you we get wet also, But it won't be that way forever, The Lord Jesus Christ is coming back and went he does he will separate his lambs out and the rest of you are so screwed.

its funny how people are critical of Texas. while we burn you laugh and mock. when disasters occur elsewhere we send food, fuel, man power, boots and coots, red adair, wild well control, eqa-search, Texas utility workers, fire fighters, rescue sytems.
What does Texas get from our fine neighbors? redicule. Just remember we are #1 in refining, petrochemical, plastics. We do not need you. You need us. If Texas suceeded we would be the 5th Richest Country in the world. We do not need you. But a little compassion and less political redicule may be a start.
I say keep refined gas in Texas and ours will be $1.00 a gallon for gasoline and the rest of the country will be $8.00 a gallon. Then we would see who is still laughing.

It is nice to see all you left wing ignorant fools playing politics on this great disaster.  You need to be ashamed of yourselves.  People are suffering and all you can think about is politics, politics, and politics.  I want one you idiots to tell me how politics plays any part of this disaster.  Maybe it is because we are 30” short of rain this year.  I guess that wouldn’t make sense to you sorry excuses for human beings.

To all of the Texans who have bashed on ANYONE for being gay, black, mexican, or athiest, or for having the "serves you right" attidute towards being in an upsidedown mortgage, or the unemployed:  I hope your house BURNS TO THE GROUND so you can see first hand how the shoe feels on the other foot!  See how it feels to need help due to problems out of your control, but only get looked down upon by those around you who are more fortuntate.

To all of the Texans who SUPPORTED others in the time of their need:  I hope the very best for you and your family in these tough times... HANG IN THERE!

I was in Texas 5 years ago and bumped into a man who was so arrogant and condescending it was really repulsive. Guy held forth at great length about how Texas was a "Republic" and how the rest of the states were not. Very proud. He never once mentioned how the Texans stole Texas from Mexico. I always thought Texas was just another shyte hole and the people there ROBTHEPUBLICAN #$%$ I mean look, little georgie bush lives there! I will say, hope his place burns to the ground with him in it.

I am from Texas.. And i have one thing to say to everyone wishing bad upon my fellow Texans... F*** YOU! You have no idea what we are going through right now with this drought and fires. I can't even believe that other Americans are saying these horrible things about Texans.. I would never wish anything bad to happen to your house, so please dont wish it upon our homes. I'm usually not one to have hate towards another person, but this is crazy. Please show us some respect and at least give us kind words, not all of these bashing comments. It's bad enough our homes are burning, but now we get hateful comments from fellow "Americans". How pathetic.. people sicken me.

I am a native Texan and here are a few things about Rick Perry: 
Thanks to Perry the schools here are ranked 47th and there is a multi-billion dollar deficit (approximately $4-billion) in the state's educational system that his policies created. He was warned by the then Republican State Comptroller 5-years ago that his tax cuts were going to cause the problem that Texas schools are going through right now. Most local school districts are facing huge budget deficits some in the multi-million dollar range and are laying off staff and teachers just to cover these shortfalls. In addition many schools are increasing class sizes to unheard of levels, in many incidents there are 30 or more students to a single teacher. 
There is a looming $27-billion deficit due next year for the state's budget that is not being talked about nationally but we in Texas are painfully aware of it. Perry took $6.4-billion in stimulus money from the Federal Government to help pay this years state deficit. This allowed the $9.1-billion State Rainy Day Fund, that Rick Perry controls, to go untouched.
Please take the time to read the article “Perry Mines Texas System to Raise Cash for Campaigns” in the New York Times, published August 20, 2011. It makes for some very interesting reading. 
As for job creation here in Texas, take a long look at the types of jobs that Perry claims to have created. For the most part these hare minimum wage or lower jobs and many are part-time.
Also look at the number of communities appearing on the 100 poorest cities in the USA. Thirty-five of the 100 are located here in Texas.
He tried to take private land here through eminent domain so that a Spanish company, Cintra could build the Trans-Texas Corridor, a super transportation system that has since been canceled when a number if issues arose about the project. More and more of the new highways build here in Texas are toll-roads, one the latest is the State Highway 121 project in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area, another controversial tollroad project involving Cintra. Cintra would have the right to collect tolls on the road for 50-years. A lot of questions were raised when it came out that the North Texas Tollway Authority was preventing from bidding on this project. A number of unanswered questions about Perry's relationship with Cintra are surfacing now and I am sure will require answers during the presidential campaign.
He also signed an executive order that would have pushed a program to require 6th grade school girls be vaccinated with a very controversial drug (Gardasil) to protect against Human Papillomavirus or HPV created by Merck which is intended to prevent cervical cancer in sexually active females. A lot of questions were raised about his motives and he dropped his push for the program when those questions became too controversial. Again, a lot of these questions centered on his financial relationship with Merck.
These are just a few issues that will be raised during the vetting process and it is doubtful that he will be able to survive the scrutiny of the national press. As we in Texas have found out, Rick Perry is not who he purports to be. Please take the time to really learn about him before you make up your mind.
If you care to do your own research please check Google, Wikipedia, The Comptroller of the State of Texas, Forbes, The Austin American Statesman, The Dallas Morning News, The Forth Worth Star Telegram, The Houston Chronicle. The New York Times, The Washington Post, just to name a few of my sources.

I hope G.H.W.Bush's house burns. I hope G.W. Bush's house burns. I hope Rick Perry's House burns.
Do you see the reciprocal hatred that is being reaped upon you ignorant rednecks for the hatred you have for gays, Hollywood, liberals and the intelligent among us whom you have hated and persecuted for the last decade?
Good. If I had some extra gasoline (maybe Bush and Cheney would lend me some) I would add fuel to the fire that would burn your redneck hate filled state!

3 places in the Bible describe in so many words the stature of Jesus Christ being Rule of God's Creation. Psalm 8:3-6, John 1:1-5, and in the NIV Bible, Revelation 3:14 says this plainly. Acknowledge this about Him to start changing the World.

What a bunch of #$%$ mindless morons on this site.  Regardless of whether you're a democrat or republican, put yourself and your home,  in this fire situation.  How do you think you'd feel if it was happening to you....and you morons are putting a political spin to this???  And, don't be bashing Texans as ALL southerners, they've moved into Texas from other parts of the U.S.  You know the parts that don't have a good economy but Texas does.  And, if they want help for the federal government...so be it., they put in more than their fair share.  So grow up.  Quit sniffing your crappy underwear, you're getting #$%$ for brains.  Signed X-yankee living in Texas.

Hopefully those people fleeing the fires in Texas will be treated better than they themselves treated the people fleeing Katrina.

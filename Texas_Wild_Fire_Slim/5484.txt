From now until September 15th the public is invited to visit Sciame Construction in Lower Manhattan to view the Pen & Ink Exhibition of John Coburn's Healing Hearts. In the early days after Sept. 11, the Toronto based artist found himself drawn to New York City, a city whose architecture he found to be his muse. He began to sketch and didn't stop. The result was a limited edition book entitled Healing Hearts that was created totally with donations. Each family of the victims of Sept. 11 received a copy of the book.

In 2006, his Toronto studio caught fire destroying the entire building and its contents -- except for the Healing Heart drawings. "They were so soaked with emotion that they couldn't burn," Coburn said. Many of the the drawings in the exhibit are charred but the images remain alive with emotion.
Coburn hopes to complete his 10-year with a documentary film about the project including footage from the New York exhibit of his work. The film will tell many of the extraordinary stories illustrated in the book.


The exhibit is free and open to the public daily from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm at the Sciame Construction Offices at 14 Wall Street, 2nd floor. You must email rsvp@thehealingheartsproject.com to make a reservation.

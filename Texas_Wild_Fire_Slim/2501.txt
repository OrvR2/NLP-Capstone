PRESCOTT, Ariz. -- Police in Arizona say two Walmart employees burglarized the store where they worked to pay for a car and a sex change operation.
Police arrested 23-year-old Spencer Danger Cullen and 19-year-old Adriano Valdes Altiveros III on Friday.
Reinhardt says Altiveros reportedly told detectives he stole cash to buy a car. He says Cullen told police she stole the money to go forward with a sex change operation.
Cullen and Altiveros remain in custody. The Yavapai County public defender's office would not say Wednesday whether the pair had been appointed attorneys.
Prescott is about 80 miles north of Phoenix.

				I realize Walmart doesn't pay a lot but Cullen should have saved his money to get a car.  Now the only wheels he'll be seeing for a while will be the ones that control the prison gates and the door on his prison cell.  

Altiveros should not have made his reason known.  However, he's going to get his wish and be some man's beeotch in prison; no sex change operation required..

				I'm guessing these fellas didn't think of movin' outta state and gettin' hitched in a state that'll marry 'em. Then, they can continue to work for Walmart, save some money and bam! ya got yer sex change.

I'm not too bright, I admit. But, this sure doesn't make a whole lotta sense to me.

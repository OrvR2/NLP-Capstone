“Man on Wire” remembers twin towersBy Claudine ZapClaudine ZapPostsEmailBy Claudine Zap | The Upshot – Mon, Aug 15, 2011

Philippe PetitIn August 1974, the still unfinished twin towers, at some 1,350 feet, were the tallest buildings in the world. The architectural monument inspired one daring young man, Philippe Petit, to commit what he called the "artistic crime of the century." The tightrope artist stepped out onto an illegally rigged wire 110 stories up, stretching 200 feet long between the two towers -- and essentially danced high above the street for almost an hour.
The film "Man on Wire" tracks Petit as he recounts his audacious plans to walk between the two towers on a tightrope, and follows this highly dangerous, and highly illegal, feat. (The title is the description on the police report.) To Petit, the twin towers were his plaything. Ten years after the towers came down in the Sept. 11 attacks, the film is an homage to the buildings that became part of the New York City skyline years ago -- and that are now gone. Interviewed recently for his one-man show of his life story, Petit said that the towers still exist -- in his mind. "I don't see time begin and end. In my head, the twin towers are still alive."
"On the subject of the towers disappearing, of course it was an immense -- sadness is not the word -- it was something alive that was pulled out of me," he said. Years after the attack, he holds onto that 1974 memory. "Nothing can change that. The memory of this adventure is an intimate, romantic, poetic, joyful feeling that will continue...for the rest of my life."

The award-winning documentary, which does not reference the attacks, unfolds like a suspenseful thriller rather than a staid recounting of the facts. The high-wire act, which took six years to plan, was done in secret, the walk itself a crime. The performance was a once-in-a-lifetime event that stopped traffic around the World Trade Center and made headlines around the globe.
While essentially a benign act 37 years ago, it is hard not to watch the movie without thinking about how different the world is now. The Frenchman's team, as the Telegraph notes, "observes the buildings relentlessly, recruits assistants, builds models, collects documents, [and] notes security patrol routes and codes." These men on a mission were crazy, but they were artists, not madmen.
Still, with nothing but their wits, the group is easily able to walk into the north and south towers dressed as deliverymen and executives (using fake IDs), and somehow sneak in a disassembled balancing pole, wire for rigging, 250 feet of one-inch braided steel cable, and a bow and arrow. The comrades hide on the top floor. The all-night setup begins, which involves shooting the wire from one building to the other with the bow and arrow. Around 7 the next morning, Petit stepped off the south tower onto the wire.
After Petit finally came down from the tightrope (unharmed), he was arrested, jailed, taken for a psychological evaluation, and released. Journalists asked the performer why he did it. The then 24-year-old responded, "When I see three oranges, I juggle. When I see two towers, I walk."
Thanks to "Man on Wire," we can see the twin towers again, too.

This is a beautiful documentary....awesome!!  To think how much has changed in the world since then in regards to security is sad.....things were so free - but this feat was no easy feat and took brains and agility and a great mind.  I saw Petit doing it actually for I was working downtown just for a couple of years and thought "another interesting day in New York"....Wow!!  See it the movie!

For anyone who hasn't seem the film, see it right away. It's truly spectacular. You know how it's going to end, you know what will happen, but it still keeps your heart racing. Petit is an incredible storyteller, and it's eerie to see him speak about the towers- it really is like they still stand.

"Journalists asked the performer why he did it. The then 24-year-old responded, "When I see three oranges, I juggle. When I see two towers, I walk."

I live only 45 minutes away from NYC, visited there hundreds of times, yet I never visited the towers because I assumed that they would always be there and I would do it some day.  That day never came. Seize the moment.

1974. I was just getting ready to start high school. I read this in the paper and it gave me nightmares since I am afraid of heights. Now I read about his thoughts, and they are comforting in a way I can't describe. When I see a movie with the twin towers still on the skyline, I make a note of it. From our apartment in Brooklyn, I could see the Empire State, the Chrysler, and after a short walk, and trip to a buddy's roof, see the Pan Am building. (Back when it was the Pan Am building.) The twin towers did not have the art deco looks of most of NYC's buildings, but still were impressive as all get out to me at that age. My kudos to Petit, and my thanks for him sharing the memories of his walk and thoughts of afterwards.

This was, perhaps, the balls-iest stunt in the history of the universe...if not beyond.

I honestly recommend this film to anyone. A Documentary that's filled with excitement, sense of humor, and touchy character. Must watch! 
Also, I happen to visit the towers as a 8 year old boy and the view from up there was just heavenly like!

I'm so happy there was no mention of the attacks in this film.  Let us remember them for their beauty, not their tragedy.

A great film.  And a great opportunity.  It is impossible to truly grieve without an understanding of what was truly lost during 9/11.  Man on Wire shows a glimmer of that loss.

I'm surprised that in the comments I've read here no one has mentioned the fact Petit never tried to cash in on the fame this walk gave him. He had all kinds of offers to endorse this and that and never did any of it. He just wanted to do something beautiful.

Sometimes when bad things happen, even thou it may hurt at first and is hard to accept, but as we continue in this life we have to embrace the good, and the bad because ultimately it will make us strong.  To loose someone you love the feeling of hurt never completely goes away, they may become less painful but you carry that person all the time in your heart.  So I want to say to those who lost their loved ones in 911, don't let them go, cherish their memory in a way that reminds you of them and the things they enjoyed.

With the wind factor so high above and the fact that they shot the wire, this is still so unbelievable the courage and the risks that i still cannot believe he did it and so easily. I have to hold on and when i went to to the the observatory, my fists were crunched up into white knuckles. This feat is so amazing, setting asside of course the awful afterath of 911 which is also unbeievable, which goes to illustrate the best and highest feats of mankind; and the lowest, most despicable unthinkable acts of mankind, something that continues to happen all over the world form the horrors in Syria to Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Rawanda, and the horrible gang crimes and serial murders here in the USA.

We have this documentary and it is phenomenal. Do yourself a favor and get it if you can. The scenes of the WTC itself, not to mention this man's story, will make it worth the price.

I was 18 at the time and worked for a company name bowes & company my job was to make deliveries of stock reports to different companies, on this day was delivering some reports to Merryl Lynch which was located in one of the towers when i saw tons of people gathering and looking up between the towers, the truth is i got goose bumps when i looked up saw what seem to be a verry thin man on a wire. to this date i still have that image in my mind, ITS SAD TO SAY THAT A LOT OF ART AND MEMORIES WHENT DOWN WHEN THE TOWERS DID, BLESS DOES THAT WENT DOWN WITH THEM.............................D.G.

Canadian dollar seen barely firming in year ahead: Reuters pollBy Claire Sibonney | Reuters – 19 hrs ago






TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is expected to hold near or just above current levels in the coming year on Canada's healthier growth prospects and higher interest rates compared to the United States.
Median forecasts in a poll of 48 global foreign exchange strategists released on Wednesday showed the currency is seen at C$0.98 to the U.S. dollar, or $1.0204, in one month, three months and six months from now.
In a year's time, the currency is expected to edge back up to C$0.972 versus the U.S. dollar, or $1.0288.
"We probably will see a stronger environment over the medium term, I think from a fundamental perspective, the growth spreads will prove to be favorable, Canada over the U.S., and we don't foresee a double-dip (recession) scenario," said Jeremy Stretch, head of FX strategy at CIBC in London.
"Even if we have pushed out expectations for the Bank of Canada (tightening) until next year ... the expectations for the Fed are probably still the best part of a year behind that and I think that's clearly going to be an influence."
The currency stood around C$0.9870 to the U.S. dollar, or C$1.0132, early on Wednesday ahead of a Bank of Canada policy announcement that was expected to sound more dovish than it did in its July communique.
Canada's commodity-linked currency was hurt this week by fears about Europe's failure to tackle its debt crisis. Some analysts think the Canadian dollar could soon flirt with the other side of U.S.-dollar parity before eventually grinding higher.
"There's more downside risk not so much from the fundamental story but just from periods of risk aversion and the Canadian dollar doesn't tend to hold up all that well when we get to volatile environments," said Derek Burleton, deputy chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank.
Canada became the first of the Group of Seven advanced economies to raise interest rates following the global recession, hiking three times from June to September last year.
But the central bank has held steady since then, cautious about amid global threats such as a slowing U.S. economy and worsening European sovereign debt crisis.
Still, most forecasters believe the Bank of Canada will resume its monetary tightening campaign by the second quarter of 2012, well ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has pledged to keep rates near zero until mid-2013. 
"The implicit assumption is that once we get into 2012 that some of these risks will at least dissipate to some extent," added Burleton.
The near-term projections were weaker than the previous survey in August, which had forecast the currency would trade at C$0.95 in one month, C$0.96 in three months, and C$0.98 in six months.
The poll's longer term outlook was stronger compared to the median 12-month forecast of C$0.99 seen a month ago.

Debate Winners: Romney, Bachmann, Tea Party
Rick Perry-bashing pays off for rivals

(Newser) -
                                    It was "attack Rick Perry night" at last  night's GOP debate in Florida -—to the extent that even Jon Huntsman got in on the act—and the Texan's rivals succeeded in landing a few blows. Mitt Romney, who wisely ignored the Tea Party debate audience to...

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry drew feisty attacks on stage and a few boos from the crowd at tonight's GOP debate in Florida, which also saw Michele Bachmann step it up a notch after fading in the first debate,  Politico  reports. Tonight kicked off with a fiery exchange on Social Security, when...

And the Winner Is ... Mitt Romney (Mostly)
His steady performance seems to make him the consensus pick over Perry

(Newser) -
                                    A consensus is taking shape from last night's GOP debate, and Mitt Romney should be pleased. He won or at least held his own in the eyes of most (but certainly not all).

(Newser) -
                                    Sure, some of them have faced off before—but tonight’s Politico/NBC News debate marks the first time  new frontrunner Rick Perry  will join the fray, making it what  Politico  calls the “first Fall Classic” for 2012 GOP presidential hopefuls. And it’s the start of a busy month...

(Newser) -
                                    Michele Bachmann  likes to talk to crowds  about "the creator of the universe, our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ." Yet for some reason, some Jewish donors think she's ... Jewish. And what may be good for her campaign coffers is bad news for Romney's, according to the...

BASTROP, Texas - Firefighters trying to control a wind-fueled  wildfire that has destroyed nearly 600 homes in Central Texas were  looking for a few overnight hours of diminished winds as thousands of  evacuees spent the night away from their threatened homes.
There's been no significant rainfall over central Texas for a year,  said CBS News correspondent Dean Reynolds, and today the consequences of  that are being seen in Bastrop and other areas. 
Since December, wildfires have consumed 3.6 million acres of Texas - an area the size of the state of Connecticut. 
Unfortunately, there is no rainfall in the forecast for the foreseeable future. 
The Texas Forest Service put out statement saying, "This is  unprecedented fire behavior. No one on the face of this Earth has ever  fought fires in these extreme conditions." 
Tom Boggus, director of the Texas Forest Service, told CBS' "The  Early Show" that as of this morning "There's no containment right now." 
 "Historic" Texas wildfires       "We've been in a defensive mode for a couple of days now, and really  all you can do is get people out of the way, protect homes where you  can, and make sure our firefighters are safe," Boggus told anchor Erica  Hill. "But today, the winds have died down so we can probably be much  more aggressive, and we hopefully can get some containment on all these  fires in the Austin area." 
Texas wildfire destroys nearly 500 homes
Winds whip up Texas wildfires

Texas Gov. Rick Perry left the campaign trail Monday and returned  to Texas for the latest outbreak of blazes. He told "The Early Show"  Tuesday that he doesn't know whether he will participate in the first  Republican debate since he entered the raced for president while his  state continues to battle persistent wildfires.
Perry mum on GOP debate as Texas wildfires rage  Boggus said 90 percent of wildfires are caused by people - directly,  or through the electricity used by us. Texans are aware of the fire  dangers. "People get it, they understand it," he said. "Especially now  it's heightened with the news media ... people understand to be very,  very careful. And with the high winds people understood how dangerous  and how volatile this state is. 
"It's historic. We've never seen fire seasons like this. We've never  seen drought like this. This is an historic time that we're living in,  and so people know and understand they've got to be extremely careful,"  Boggus said. (To watch the interview click on the video player below.)

For Bastrop hotel owner Mona Patel, the wildfire left her no room to  maneuver: "They just gave us the final warning to leave right now," she  said. "It's scary. My mind's lost. I don't know what to do."
It was a sentiment shared by some 5,000 people who've been  forced from their homes, or what's left of them, and a wall of smoke and  fire 16 miles long blackened the croplands of central Texas dotted with  parched and highly combustible pine and cedar trees. 
"Didn't look like it was going to get to our house," said  resident Steve Conti. "But then the wind changed direction and came  through." 
"Five minutes is all we had, five minutes," said Josephina  Morales, one of the 400 people in emergency shelters right now. "I left  with my clothes on my back and that was it. 
"It was scary, when you go back to the driveway, it was just like two blocks, three blocks down the road," Morales said. 
Scary is how many Texans are describing the scene: "We were  just all scared, hoping that we have some kind of mercy if God sees us,"  said Mona Patel. 
The wind came from Tropical Storm Lee, but not the rains - no moisture at all to stem the wildfire's rapid advance. 
Boggus of the Texas Forest Service said he will continue to request  resources from out-of state to supplement the firefighters on the  ground, many of whom are volunteers. 
"In Texas the number one line of defense are volunteer  firemen," he said. "So we're there to support them. But all the  firefighters are fatigued. And that's really our concern right now is  getting replacements in here, making sure our firefighters are safe and  get rested, so we can attack this fire head-on."
Boggus said 12,000 individuals have come from across the  United States to help battle wildfires. But, he added, "We're not the  only crisis going on. The tropical storm still causes issues. Irene  causes issues in the northeast, and California and Arizona are having  fires. So we know we're not the only game in town, but we're going to  continue to request resources and we're going to use what we have  wisely."
 Slack winds were expected after midnight Tuesday, enabling  firefighters to make progress on the massive blaze racing through  rain-starved farm and ranchland.
"You have to be optimistic and at the same time prepared for the  worst," Texas Forest Service spokesman John Nichols said Monday night,  acknowledging the weather's unpredictability.

First  I would like to wish the people of Texas the best in this horrible  event. I drove through Texas years ago while on active duty in the  military and they are good people. I hope they put the fires out today,  as this has taken 2 lives and hundreds of homes. When they rebuild down  the road, Texans should demand fireproof shingles, roofs, exterior  materials. They are available and could save lives and homes. In Europe  were my Grandpa lived they have roof shingels made very similar to the  red clay flower pot we are familiar with here. They do not burn period.  Also deck and fencing material is now available that is made from  recycled plastic, which only burns at very high temps. Texas should also  look at their highway departments that have equipment to cut grass,  bushes, trees and buy more equipment like bush-hogs, machines that can  drive over rough terrain to cut the dry material near homes before they  become a danger to the good people of Texas.

I'm  just relieved that there is no such thing as climate change - just  "historic" conditions. It relieves us all of having to listen to all  those old, boring scientists. 

What astounds me is why do all  these erstwile geological experts decry what 99% of scientists agree on  and yet are the first ones at the hospital for some new cure we  discover? Hubris? Something their God has told them? Too much AM radio? 

I  have to laugh about the comment that carbon-based life forms require  C02. What did you study in school? Do you think we fix C02? Plants take  in CO2 and make sugars, that is the key part of photosynthesis for life  on earth. Then we eat plants. If it weren't for this, nothing you can  see would exist, except rocks. Plants have mechanisms for accumulating  and storing C02, so they don't need the higher levels that we are seeing  to do just fine, thanks. Reply to this comment

Where  will Barack find the money for FEMA and the U.S. Fire Administration  for these rampant wild fires? Obama insists that American Forces will  invade Syria to remove Assad. He spent trillions of dollars fighting  throughout the Middle East. Reply to this comment

Obama insists that American Forces will NOT invade Syria. He could have invaded Libya but chose not to.

I  feel sorry for the Democrats in Texas and hope they get Federal aid if  needed......however I sincerely hope the rest of Texas don't get a dime  from the Federal Government......the same Government they detest. What  goes around ....comes around. Reply to this comment

Maybe if Governor Perry hires more firefighters and teachers he might save his state. Reply to this comment 
 


 by reality_sanity September 6, 2011 4:30 PM EDT 
He  cannot because he and the state legislature have concurred reduced  Texas's budget for firefighters and equipment AFTER THE FIRES STARTED.  Republicans CHOSE to create this issue in Texas WHEN THEY voluntarily  chose to eliminate significant funding for fire fighting services. I  guess the general welfare does not include protecting one's home,  property or person from fire as far as the State of Texas and the  Republicans are concerned.  


 by tjcrew1 September 6, 2011 5:48 PM EDT 
If Gov. Perry can't see the light, maybe he can smell the smoke.

1,000 homes destroyed already! 

Two fires near our house now - each one mile away Reply to this comment

This is certainly not a year to date figure with over a million acres of Texas BURNED on Governor Perry's watch is it?  


 by retm-w September 6, 2011 4:34 PM EDT 
Stay safe Zann.

We  will be able to settle any more debate over man made global climate  change in the next 3-5 years I predict. By then of course it may be too  late but one can always hope. Reply to this comment 



 by noloyalisti September 6, 2011 3:57 PM EDT 
Some  of the evidence for man made global climate changed has been the RATE  at which the observed changes are occurring. While there have been  natural periods of cooling and warming, the cycles are on the order of  100s of years as bugs pointed out.

We are seeing radical changes  in less than 10 years and some on a year to year basis. This is  predicted by the global climate change model based on increasing burning  of fossil fuels. We are seeing unprecedented storms, droughts and ice  cap retreat.

If you read opinions on this keep in mind RATES:  rates of normal geological cycles vs. current observations. I think you  will see more rapid changes that will support the model in a very short  time (less than 3-5 years). Reply to this comment 
 


 by bugwhips September 6, 2011 4:04 PM EDT 
None of the changes are "unprecedented" and can be found since the planet was formed.  


 by noloyalisti September 6, 2011 4:09 PM EDT 
You  mean billions of years ago. I think you knew unprecedented since the  evidence for the effect of man's activities starting 150 years ago or  so.

As you said we were in a cooling period 150 years ago that was abruptly terminated due to the Industrial Revolution.

The plant (bugwhips) requiring CO2 as he emits O2 for the HUMANS to survive to speaks again.

by bugwhips September 6, 2011 3:35 PM EDT
...
Oh and US carbon based lifeforms require CO2 to exist, or do you want to kill us all off?  


 by bugwhips September 6, 2011 4:00 PM EDT 
So are you saying because plants "fix" carbon into cellulose (that we eat) and release O2 we are NOT carbon based lifeforms?

Must be true according to silicon crystal based reality_sanity.  1

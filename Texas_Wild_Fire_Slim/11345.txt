May 8, 2011 – MERKEL, Texas – More than 200 federal, state and local resources are working on the 65,000-acre Dickens County Complex burning approximately 73 miles east of Lubbock. The complex fire began as two separate wildfires - Edwards and Batch Camp - but burned together late Saturday night. It was determined that a lightning strike from a thunderstorm Friday caused the wildfires. Two homes and an oil pipeline are threatened.  “The weather will be a challenge to our fire crews,” said Gary Bennett, Incident Commander, Texas Lone Star State Incident Management Team. “We have extremely critical fire weather conditions for the next several days and that will hamper containment efforts.”  Beginning Sunday, May 8 and lasting through Wednesday, May 11, critical fire weather conditions are expected to be widespread across an area west of a line from Wichita Falls to Abilene to San Angelo to Del Rio. High winds moving across record-dry fuels will result in fire intensities very difficult to control. Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above normal and relative humidity will fall to the single digits. “Evacuations are common under these conditions,” said Texas Forest Service Fire Operations Chief Mark Stanford. “Responders, emergency planners and residents should be prepared to leave.” Residents may protect their homes, stay abreast of current wildfire dangers and evacuate safely if a wildfire is bearing down on the community.

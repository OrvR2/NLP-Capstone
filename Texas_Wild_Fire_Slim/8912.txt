   TrekDesk Treadmill Desk appears along side Richard Dreyfuss in the television series “Weeds”.Phoenix, AZ (PRWEB) September 07, 2011  Unique products often pique the interest of television and movie producers designing sets for their productions reflective of current cultural trends. TrekDesk treadmill desks have been used behind the scenes by writers and producers for its health benefits but never made it on screen for the general public, until recently. The popular ShoTime series “Weeds” brought the TrekDesk Treadmill Desk out of the shadows and into the homes of millions in a recent episode.

We are just hoping that art really does imitate life and more people get the message of movement,” stated Steve Bordley, CEO of TrekDesk Treadmill Desks.

Mich. governor signs 48-month welfare limitBy KATHY BARKS HOFFMAN - Associated Press | AP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Gov. Rick Snyder on Tuesday signed into law a stricter, four-year lifetime limit on cash welfare benefits, prompting advocates for the poor to warn that tens of thousands of residents will find themselves without cash assistance on Oct. 1.Michigan's first-year Republican chief executive said the state will offer exemptions to the limit for those with a disability who can't work, those who care for a disabled spouse or child and those who are 65 or older and don't qualify for Social Security benefits or receive very low benefits.Some recipients who are the victims of domestic violence also may be temporarily exempted."We are returning cash assistance to its original intent as a transitional program to help families while they work toward self-sufficiency," Snyder said in a statement. He noted that the state still will help the poor by offering food stamps, health care coverage through Medicaid, child care and emergency services.Then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, signed a bill that created a four-year limit starting in 2007. But that law exempted many welfare recipients, including those whose caseworkers said they were making progress toward finding employment.The 2010 election of Snyder and the simultaneous Republican takeover of the Michigan House gave the GOP a free hand to set its own course on public assistance.The change gives Michigan the Midwest's toughest welfare time limit, according to a survey by The Detroit News. It said there are five-year limits in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin. Indiana has a two-year limit for adults — but none for children.Gilda Jacobs of the Michigan League for Human Services said she expects about 41,000 people to lose their cash assistance payments on Oct. 1 when the state's new budget year begins. That includes 29,700 children, according to the Michigan Department of Human Services."We're very, very concerned," Jacobs said. "As the days go by, new people will be meeting the 48-month limit.  ...  More will be falling off that cliff."The new law will reduce the number of children and adults receiving cash assistance by nearly a fifth, from more than 221,000 to around 180,000. Enforcing a four-year limit will save the state more than $60 million annually, according to a House Fiscal Agency analysis.Jacobs said it's hard to see how 11,000 adults will find a job when Michigan's July unemployment rate was 10.9 percent, tied with South Carolina for third-highest in the nation."We still have to preserve a safety net for people who, through no fault of their own, can't find a job," she said, noting that most cash assistance goes to help poor residents pay their rent. "There's obviously a lot of anxiety out there. Folks aren't sure exactly what this means to them."State officials say they're working with nonprofit organizations to direct welfare recipients to other services and provide a "soft landing" as they lose benefits. Recipients will be connected with other resources, given housing and job placement assistance for up to three months beyond October and mentored by trained job navigators."Michigan continues to face financial challenges, and the fiscal reality is that we cannot afford to provide lifetime cash assistance to recipients who are able to work," Health and Human Services director Maura Corrigan said in a statement. "Enforcing lifetime limits for cash assistance ensures that available funds are targeted toward those recipients who need a helping hand while they find employment."Michigan ranked 38th in child poverty for 2009, defined as income below $21,756 for a family of two adults and two children. About 23 percent of Michigan's children lived in poverty in 2009, compared with 20 percent nationally. In 2000, only 14 percent of Michigan children lived in poverty. The average age of a child in a family receiving cash assistance is around 7 years old.Snyder, a Republican, has said reducing the number of children living in poverty is a priority of his administration.The Michigan Catholic Conference has objected to the four-year limit. The conference said the effect will be felt for years by society and by children who lose services.___Kathy Barks Hoffman can be reached at http://twitter.com/kathybhoffman.

Look how many women on state assistance has a cell phone, get their hair and nails done, and buy $100 tennis shoes.  I KNOW, I have 25 family members doing the same thing !!!!!!!

I see SO many poor poor people on Welfare mind you that drive an Escalade, wear designer clothing, have Timberland boots and have their hair and nails "did" all the time. Now can you tell me how much a brand new Escalade costs? If someone can afford that they don't need MY taxes to pay for it!

My idea for welfare reform in Vermont is that each town is allocated a certain amount of money each year to provide welfare for its citizens, and every year on Town Meeting Day the residents who wish to receive benefits must stand in front of their neighbors and explain why they need welfare.  If the townsfolk feel the case merits welfare then they can vote for it, otherwise the town must return any surplus money.  Is that the entire idea?  No! But the rest involves checks and balances to ensure a corruption free welfare system.

Make welfare recipients drug test on a regular basis and cut them off when they fail. THAT will save millions more than setting a 4 yr cap. I once lived next to a lady who had been on welfare since she got pregnant with her first kid (16+yrs)...she didn't drive a Caddy or dressed fancy but she spent hundreds on getting/staying high all day every day! So while I was putting in an honest 40 and going to school, part of my check was going to this pill popping, weed and crack smoking, alcoholic mother that didn't even bother to spend any of her food stamps on nutritious food for her kids (hello Ramen!) nor any of that SSI money that she collected for her kids being complete spazzes (yep, that sure aided the purchase of many illegal drugs while her kids were walking around in clothes that were too small and sleeping on a mattress with the springs sticking out, without sheets...I really could go on but I won't). Yes, there are people that NEED assistance. But the drug testing would "weed" (pun intended) out the mooching masses that just refuse to put down the pipe/straw/bong/needle/pills in order to find and keep a job.

To those who gave a "thumbs down" on this article: How many of you are on welfare? How many of you are able bodied? I will bet at least 90% of the "thumbs down" are sitting on their lazy butts with $600 computers and posting these comments!!! There are HABITUAL welfare people who spend the whole day just trying to milk the system. It is about time the States are getting the ba11s to do something about this problem. DEMOCRATS=WELFARE=OBAMA=ILLEGALS (he has at least 2 relatives who are in this country illegally)=UNIONS=SOCIALISM=OBAMA/DEMOCRATS!!!

In my county in NY we have 47 human services agencies where people can go and get"help".
My taxes are now 2 times the amount of my mortgage payment.   Our city (Ithaca, NY) has become as cess pool of people on every form of welfare you can imagine!  What used to be a  safe, beautiful, prosperous  place to live is now a gettho full of druggies, drunks, murderers, black and white trash, transients and garbage.

I always tried to kind of like Snyder; I meet so many who claim to be American and aren't. Snyder is. And upon that note, "What a GENEROUS guy!" I'll bet it starts now, the limit, after you people in his State have "been at the teat" for so long already. As I recall, you're ALL Canadian and, be that as it may, it isn't as if the Governor is "Tryin' to kill 'ya". Suck it up, and be glad you didn't try your sh*tty little liar's act in Oregon. You're a nice guy, Snyder! With who's money? Oh, well -- You'll be alright, maybe.

I'm sick of working 70 hours a week (and away from home over 100) just to have the fed and state take 35% of my pay and give it to lazy a$$e$ that will not work if they can get a check for free. I know several people that are able bodied and don't work because "they don't have to". I'm about ready to quit legit work and just work "under the table" so the gov't can't steal my money anymore.

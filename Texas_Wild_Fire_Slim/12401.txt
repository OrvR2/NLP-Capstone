The nation will pay tribute to the victims who died in the tragic incident. It will be a ceremony to reflect on the decade since the terrorists toppled the Twin Towers, damaged the Pentagon and crashed a jetliner in rural Pennsylvania. While most of the attention will focus on New York’s ceremony, there will also be events at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania. Different ceremonies will also be observed in communities across the country, from a stair climb in Seattle to a 9/11 memorial dedication in Sarasota, Florida.Dignitaries Attending The 9/11 10th AnniversaryPresident Barack Obama and his predecessor, former President George W. Bush, will be among the eight current and former elected officials to deliver readings at the ceremony. The ceremony is set to begin at 8:35 a.m. with the sound of bagpipes and drummers. Mr. Obama, the first sitting president to attend the annual ceremony, gave the green light earlier this year for the military mission that killed Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the deadliest foreign attack on American soil.United Flight 93 PassengersOn Saturday in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the 40 passengers and crew who fought back against their hijackers aboard Flight 93 before it crashed on Sept. 11 were honored for their heroism. A ceremony was being dedicated to them as the first phase of a memorial at the nation’s newest national park, the Associated Press reported. The hijackers who intended to crash the plane in Washington  “never made it because of the determination and valor of the passengers and crew of United Flight 93. The plane crashed in Pennsylvania field, less than 20 minutes by air” from the target, said Jon Jarvis, director of the National Park Service, according to the AP. Vice President Joe Biden and former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton were among those attending the Shanksville event, the AP said.Opening Of The One World Trade CenterThe 10th anniversary of 9/11 also marks the official opening of the National September 11 Memorial—twin reflecting pools that sit within the footprints of the Twin Towers and feature bronze panels on which the names of the dead are inscribed. A 9/11 museum is scheduled to open at the World Trade Center site next September. For many families, it will be the first time they see the twin reflecting pools, each nearly an acre in size and featuring the largest man-made waterfalls in North America. Family members undoubtedly will be looking for their loved ones’ names around the pools. The names of every person who died in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and the 2001 attacks are etched in bronze.In this article you learned that Americans are commemorating the 10th anniversary of September 11.

      NASA Unveils New Detailed Photos of Apollo Moon Landing Sites

This story was updated at 10:31 p.m. EDT.

	New photos of several Apollo moon landing sites were released today (Sept. 6), showing extraordinary new details about three areas on the lunar surface that were visited by humans. The images include the sharpest views yet of tracks left by the astronauts and their lunar rovers.

	"The images look very spectacular, as you can see for yourself," Mark Robinson, an Arizona State University, Tempe scientist, who is the principal investigator of LRO's camera, said in a news briefing today.

	The pictures were taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), a robotic probe in orbit around the moon. The new views from the spacecraft's narrow angle camera are only the third time that close-up pictures of the landing sites have been snapped and resolved by the unmanned spacecraft around the moon.

	In one image of the Apollo 17 landing site, the last tracks left by astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt on the moon are visible. The crisscrossing footprints can be easily distinguished from the tracks left by the astronauts' lunar rover.

	And, since Robinson is well aware of what the lunar rovers look like, he said he "can actually see, if you squint really hard – can begin to resolve the seats and the left wheels that are slightly turned to the left."

Revisiting the Apollo missions

	The new batch of images released today represent three different lunar landing sites: Apollo 12, Apollo 14 and Apollo 17. Scientists and historians alike are hoping they will help paint a clearer and more detailed picture of the Apollo missions.

	In particular, being able to clearly see tracks and equipment on the moon – and their relative brightness or darkness on the moon's surface – can reveal important clues about the lunar environment.

	"From a science standpoint, [the images] are important for two reasons," Robinson said. "They tell us something about the photometric properties of the moon – why are they darker? Scientists are working to investigate that question. In a more practical sense, it allows us to find the exact spot where samples were collected."



	The sharper views also allow scientists to more accurately identify objects and pieces of hardware that were left on the moon. Robinson himself compared the new pictures with images taken from the missions to help pinpoint some of the bright objects on the surface, such as experiments, thermal blankets, and life support backpacks used on moonwalks that were discarded by astronauts before they blasted off from the moon.

	And for those interested in whether the planted American flags from the Apollo missions are still standing, Robinson said it's difficult to know for sure. [Top 10 Apollo Hoax Theories]

	"I've looked around, and all I really see are the spots where the flag was planted," Robinson said.

	With the moon's extreme hot and cold temperatures and ultraviolet environment, Robinson said it's highly unlikely that anything is left of the nylon flags after so many decades.

	"If the flags are still there, they're probably in pretty rough shape," he said.

Circling the moon

	The new images were taken over the course of a month-long period when the LRO spacecraft entered into a low altitude orbit that dipped to within 14 miles (22 kilometers) of the moon's surface at times. LRO normally circles the moon at an altitude of about 31 miles (50 km) above the lunar surface.

	As the spacecraft zeroed in on the three Apollo landing sites, the probe was also able to collect valuable observations using its other instruments.

	"We were able to make new measurements of radiation environments close to the lunar surface," said Richard Vondrak, an LRO project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.

	Today, the probe returns to a more circular orbit, Vondrak said. In mid-December, LRO will shift into an elliptical orbit with its lowest altitude at 19 miles (30 km) over the south pole, and its highest point at 124 miles (200 km) over the north pole.

	The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been in orbit around the moon since June 2009. The $504 million car-sized spacecraft first captured close-up images of the Apollo landing sites in July 2009, which revealed new details about the sites and even spotted hardware that was left behind on the lunar surface.

	The LRO probe is currently on an extended mission through at least September 2012.

	On Thursday (Sept. 8), NASA will launch a new mission to measure the moon's gravity field in unprecedented detail. The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission is made up of twin spacecraft that will orbit the moon in tandem.

NASA's budget was huge with 200,000 employees by 1966. The cost of the Vietnam war and the accident that killed Grissom, White and Chaffee in 1967 both factors contributed to congress cutting funds to the space program. The huge contract work for parts and technology was obviously also cut when NASA cancelled Appolos 18, 19 and 20. Thus NASA was cash strapped and the industrial complex that built craft and systems supporting these missions all but melted away. At first the shuttle and support systems used were far less expensive but also ballooned exponentially in costs as wages continued to rise. Scrapped mission Appollo18 - 30 included a manned Lunar base with launchings of manned flights to Mars and Venus by 1980 became completely financially unrealistic. Today, NASA's congressionally funded budget is $15 Billion with approximately 2,000 employees. However, the Dept of Defense space program has a funded budget of $27 billion most of which is spent secretly. Look at everything you buy and compare it to 1965 prices and how much it has increased and you will find the answer why we only did three moon landing missions. Those of you who are old enough (Especially if you lived in FLA or CA) can easily recall the tens of thousands of laid off space industry employees with rampant forclosures and the severe economis impact on many communities around the US. . Elected in 1968, it was Nixon that directed our space program to change course and do the Apollo - Soyez missions with the USSR. The last Lunar landing was in 1972. Currently, the Chinese are vowing to land astronauts on the moon in the future. The cancelled Apollo 18 mission never happened. However, a science fiction hollywood movie to be released in the near future will be about a supposedly secret Apollo 18 mission that encountered hostile lunar aliens and so on. That's all I will reveal about it which is sure to be a major box office success. I can only imagine all the conspiracy talk it will generate! lol. The movie will be loaded with actual NASA film footage (Purchased from NASA) and the movie footage will be so real that many viewers will have a hard time distinguishing what is real from fiction. Thanks for reading this post.

is this the best we can do after 40 years? pictures of where we were from an orbiting satellite? some new measurements  for $504 million taxpayer dollars?

SSOOOOOOO, how come we can see the "Footprints of the astronauts" around the LEM, we can see the dual tracks of the rover and we can see how far it is from the LEM. Whyzit we cannot see the tracks of the astronaut who "parked the rover there" and had to walk back to the LEM to depart the moon??? Aaaannnnndd, Whyzit the rover left no dual tire marks,discernable, from its point of origin to where it was finally "parked". Just observing is all, see if you can find the missing tracks,everything else shows up so plainly..........

There would be no reason to put out these additional photos after all these years....if the original photos and video where not so suspious...in the first place.....The American people are sick of all of the fishy...obviously contrived explainations ...and prearranged scripts put out by the government past and current......PLEASE do us the favor and just stop trying to cover .....it is 40 years ago now.................

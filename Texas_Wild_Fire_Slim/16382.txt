We are collecting anonymous customer data to understand how we can better serve 
  our customers. This data will help us to develop new product and service offerings 
  and provide more value to our online community.
Additionally, we are an advertising supported site. This means that in order 
  for us to continue to offer access to the site free of charge to you, we need 
  to be able to better serve our advertisers. We are able to deliver more relevant advertisements from advertisers when they want to reach a particular zip code, age groups or gender.

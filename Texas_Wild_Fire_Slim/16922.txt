The Tribune-Democrat:
SHANKSVILLE —  	As the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks approaches, a video  shot just minutes after the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 has  surfaced.
While the video does not show the moment of impact, it clearly shows a  mushroom cloud rising from the site of the crash at an abandoned strip  mine near Shanksville.


The voice of Berlin resident Dave Berkebile, now deceased, can be heard speaking calmly in the background.
“This is the remains of an airplane crash over on Lambertsville Road,”  he said. “Probably a terrorist bomb on board that blew up.”
Berkebile said the crash “shook the heck out of the house … A great, big, black cloud just mushroomed right up into the air.”
Then he added: “I wonder if there is anything left of Lambertsville.”
Donna Glessner, who is collecting oral histories for the National  Park Service, saw the video and said she believes it is the earliest  known video of the crash.

If you listen to the mainstream media – the plane “crashed”. 
However, if you actually research – and listen to the eye witnesses,
and look at the photographs – you should be able to determine that
the plane was blown up in midair.  
A plane crashing on the ground would leave  plane parts, body parts, etc.
There was NOTHING there but a crater sized hole. 
U.s. Mil. doesn’t want to have people know they shot down their own people –
hence the story spin.  The passengers on that flight may have attempted to
take the muslims by force – but a plane crashing would leave a ……. plane – or
some parts of it.  There was NOTHING left – 
N-O-T-H-I-N-G.

There would be much more “parts” and pieces scattered farther if it blew up in flight than crashing in one piece.

You are correct, the plane was shot down.  Why were “they” recovering debris from Indian Lake and the surrounding area?  Indian lake is a couple of miles from the crash site..

your logic is flawed. if it was blown up in the air, pieces would break away and be recovered. if it hit the ground intact, the ensuing flames would consume everything. but you keep on keeping on truther…

if the plane was shot down there would have been debris on the ground maybe for miles. when a plane is blown up in flight it rains parts and bodies. look at the plane that was blown up over ireland, the parts on the ground. and the mans video says noting about fighter jets flying overhead if they were there he would have heard and seen them. stop with the nonsence already.

Look at the Lockerbie bombing and compare that to the valu jet crash.  Pieces from a blown up plane versus big hole in the swamp from an impact.  Sounds like a good conspiracy theory though because if the flight had continued much longer it almost certainly would have been blown up.  Rather than let another plane taken over by terrorists crash into another building.

Did it go boom in the air or get sent into the ground?
Answer — Lockerbeed, Scottland. The terror bombing that took down the plane was IN THE AIR and debris was scattered everywhere for miles, large and small parts, along with bodies and the rest.
Look to the other crashes where the plane has gone into the ground, there are parts found all around the sight. Just look through the newspapers since planes first came about and you will see the fact is clear, this flight WAS NOT SHOT DOWN OR BLOWN UP IN THE AIR.

Dear Via,  I for one respect conspiracy theorists, a name the left applies to people who seek the truth. I was in the Army 23 years and a cop, so it’s in my nature to question that which is questionable. But you need to do som research not just listen to one side. If thplane went straight down into the ground, that was reonably soft (not rock) then the momentum will drive most of the debris into the ground. I was not involved in any part of that investigation, but there was some debris at the site localized tp the impact crater. If it was shot down, there would have been numerous eye and ear witnesses. The sound of the multiple jets, the launch of the missile, the impact and the plane would have come down, depending on how much missile damage, over a large swath of real-estate. It’s like the wing nuts who said they saw explosions as the buildings collapsed. Yes you could see windows blowing out, but it was from the pressure of the buildings co lazing on enclosed offices. We need you to question that which seems suspicious, but refer to science not anti government lunatics for answers. And keep on questioning!

I think this video actually helps put that theory to rest. Watch it again, this guy witnessed it and says the plane crashed and a huge mushroom cloud came up. The only thing he says about a bomb is “that‘s what they’re saying on TV” but his actual account of what he saw does not sound like a bomb blowing up or planes shooting it down. He doesn‘t mention fighter jets anywhere in the area and he doesn’t mention the plane blowing up mid- air.

Cut it out with the truther BS.  Most plane crashes are not nose dives into the ground, so your understanding of what a normal plane crash would leave behind doesn’t really apply here.  Also, your claim that NOTHING was found is absolutely wrong.  That’s based on a deliberate misquote from Loose Change from the coroner who arrived at the scene.  Loose Change claims that he said that he stopped being a coroner because there were no bodies.  However, the coroner has addressed the issue himself.  What he actually said was that he stopped being a coroner because the cause of death was obvious.  There were no complete bodies, but they did find enough body parts and DNA to identify all of the passengers.  For a movement of “truthers,” you all ironically base your inane theories on half-truths and lies.

TroyBray Posted on September 5, 2011 at 11:35am
Really? I suppose you’ve done a lot of research on the effects of a plane nosediving into the ground, and the type of “wound” it would leave. In my opinion, a crater with debris spread over a wide area (similar to what an artillery shell would produce) is what you should expect in the “official” version, and that is what I saw in pictures of the crash site.
   And so what if the Air Force shot down the plane? Three planes had already crashed into buildings, causing more deaths than just the people on the plane. The people on the plane were dead anyway, no matter what the Air Force did, but people on the ground were in danger.
Idiot conspiracy theorists. Spend some time fixing problems, instead of inventing plots and conspiracies that don’t exist.

NOTHING, because it exploded on impact with tanks full of jet fuel.
President Bush has said he gave the order to shoot down any aircraft that did not respond to orders to land. If they had they would have said so.

Some here say the video puts conspiracy to rest. They say the videographer “witnessed it” but they don’t realize he was not outside pointing his camera towards a plane going down. No, he was INSIDE his house and he said the explosion complete rocked his house. So he grabs a camera, and maybe MINUTES later he sees a plume of black smoke coming up.  In other words, he SAW NOTHING.
The video is useless really, and proves absolutely nothing.  The doubters need not glob on to such nonsense conclusions. Boy, there are a lot of nonsense globbers here…
You need to lighten up and believe in more conspiracy. Its all around us. Wake up.  Governments generally are evil and do evil things.  Look around the world and WITNESS that.

He says “bomb” because that’s what was being said on the scanner. They were saying it on the scanner because that’s what Ziad Jarrah told ATC when he hijacked the plane. If the plane was blown to pieces in the sky, it would have left a debris field over dozens of miles… not a crater-sized hole.

If the plane was shot down it oddly enough is not all bad news. There is little question that the flight was headed back to DC with the target probably being the White House or the Hill. As horrible as the consequence of shooting our own citizens out of the air may be, at least it says something about our ability to intercept with deadly force. Horrible choice but speaks to our abilities.

There wouldn’t be a creator in the ground unless the plan took a nose dive into the ground thus crashing. If it blew up in mid-air there will be millions of pieces spread out over miles. It wasn’t shot down it crashed into the ground nose first. You can also hear it on the cockpit recorders.

M 4 Colt Posted on September 5, 2011 at 4:55pm
Those of you who said it blown in in mid air are wrong, when a plane hits the ground at 600 knots (thats 690 MPH) it leaves nothing but a hole in the ground, if you don’t believe me look up some of the photos on line of high speed military airplane crashes. One more point if you think i am wrong look up the Florida Air crash that crashed into the swamps about 20 years ago all it left was a hole in the ground and very little came out of it. The NTSB was lucky with that crash because they were able to find some body parts and a little of the plane like the landing gear ( by the way they found the landing gear at this crash site and the black box flight recorder) this was due to the fact that the plane crashed into water so there was no fire after the crash other then the fire that was on board that caused the crash in the first place. People seem to thing that airplanes are these big indestructible things THEY ARE NOT, they are made out of THIN aluminum, some steel and its all held together by lots and lots of rivets and a few bolts, so when you add speed into the mix and the fact that the plane hit the ground at an 80 degree nose down angle and the FIRE AFTER IMPACT remember now this plane was fully loaded with fuel to make a trip clear across the United States so thats a WHOLE LOT OF FUEL and it had used very little of that fuel because it had just taken off so what your left with is a smoking hole in the ground. End of story.

M 4 Colt, What are the serial numbers on the flight recorders found at “flight 93′s crash site”?  Oh, you don’t know.  Weird that nobody knows, isn’t it?  Maybe the government is keeping it secret for our safety.  Maybe not.  IF it’s not for our safety, then why would they need to keep it secret?  National security perhaps?  I don’t think so.  Not ten years after the deed.  In fact, the only facts that we know about flight 93 is, well, it’s missing.  There is no connection to the “wreckage” and flight 93.  Oh, maybe it was the driver’s licenses.  I mean, no one could have printed those out.  They’ve never done that before.  Everything you want to know about this happened before with Vietnam.  Look it up.  “Enlighten” yourselves.  Do what Mr. Beck suggested and get out there and investigate.

Jedi i don’t need to look up anything because I have family members who live close by the crash site, they sent me photos on line from the aftermath of the crash site, in the photos they sent me were shots of the engines being taken away by truck from the crash site or what was left of them along  with the landing gear and as far as the S/N from the flight recorder you ask about i am sure its listed on the NTSB file for this crash but i have to say i have never tried to look it up. I am a pilot and have almost 30 years flight time in high performance aircraft and every so often the FAA sends out a flyer to all pilots that list‘s all the accidents and list’s the out come of the NTSB investigation for that crash, what they listed as the cause of this crash was the controlled flight of the aircraft at a steep nose down attitude into the terrain, the reason for that was the take over of the aircraft from the flight crew by terrorist. There was no bomb, no mid air shoot down by fighter jet, no government cover up, this was just some middle east nut jobs that were trying to make a statement but in the last few minutes of their lives they found out what real Americans are made of, they knew they were going to get their ass’s kicked by the passengers on that plane so they crashed that plane like the cowards they are.

The Monk, i am sorry to disagree with you about the crash of value jet but if you read the NTSB report you will see the information i am about to give is correct. Yes the pilot did lose control of the aircraft but it was not of his own doing.
 The fire that started in the baggage compartment was caused by O2 canister that did not have their safety’s installed right and were being sent back to Value Jet, the O2 canisters had just been inspected by a company called Saber tech, the repair tech that inspected them did not install the safety’s on the cans right, how i know this information is correct is because i use to work for Saber Techs overhaul center in Phoenix when this crash happened.
  One of the cans caught fire and started the rest of the cans in the case on fire, the fire was VERY HOT and it burned through the control cables that move the control surfaces on the aircraft so once they were burned through the pilots could no longer control the plane so then they were just spectators to the crash, but hay they at least had a front row seat to the crash, right. As for the passengers the NTSB report stated that they had all been overcome by the smoke and heat in the cabin, so at least they were not awake when they hit the ground.

M 4 Colt Posted on September 6, 2011 at 7:13am
Just an fyi the O2 cans are used to generate oxygen for the passengers in the event of lost of cabin pressure. When you go on a flight the flight attended tells you that in the event of the lost of cabin pressure that a mask will drop down in front of you the O2 can uses heat to generate oxygen through a chemical reaction part of the reaction causes the can to get VERY HOT. Oh ya Monk, one more thing they did find parts of the plane after the crash how else do you think they were able to find out what caused the crash in the first place.

So  i will just remind those on both sides that even this little debate forum is a fount of info. for those who have for the first time been confronted with ANY info at all on this subject. This will cause many,not all ,to check out the unearthed details of 9-11 .

A decade later, my tears of pride and gratitude still flow easily, but there is also anger that this administration has turned legitimate political debate about this country’s security and prosperity into racial and class warfare. America‘s promise and survival depend on Obama’s defeat in 2012.

Jedipatriot, yes Van Jones is a truther. Not sure what you mean when you suggest we look at his past. I looked at it and it is clear he is a communist. But I only say that because he said he was and because he associated himself with communists and communist organizations and sympathizers. 
By the way, his followers are also communists, marxists, far left radicals and assorted mental cases. But they are probably nice people, so there is that…

He is a conniving, manipulative usurper and only uses things/people that he thinks he can.  His only contribution to the truth movement is making us look like (State) communists or Sotero lovers.

As we approach the 10th anniversary of the largest attack on American soil, let us not forget the Heroes that valiantly sacrificed their lives in order to save others, or forget the Heroes that drove that plane into the ground, or the Heroes that rushed into burning buildings to save our neighbors, or Our Men and Women in uniform, fighting to keep this nation free. Let us not forget how we felt as we watched those towers fall, how we felt when we gathered with strangers to pray, what we heard as the world remained silent. Let us not forget the emotions, the anger, the hurt, the fear, the compassion, the brotherly love. Let us not forget how we turned to God in hopes that he would hear our prayers. Let us remember! God bless the families that suffered great loss and God Bless America!

@MERRITTG    Thanks for saying it all. I sat last night at the computer and watched a couple of hours of video from that horrendous day and everything you wrote … all of those emotions … came rushing back. I watched the videos by some of the “truthers”, too. Interesting theories. Pure bunk.
The History Channel has an enlightening perspective on 9/11 in New York as it allows you to interact and see and hear from nine who were there that day with video cameras in hand at various locations throughout the New York City area. http://www.history.com/interactives/witness-to-911
Should someone desire to know what evil looks like they need only to spend time watching 9/11 home videos and see evil’s destructive powers. Those jumping from the Towers = ultimate, understandable desperation. Those brave rescuers rushing into the Towers = all that is good and righteous about this great nation. Never forget the hurt and sacrifice. Never forget the resolve that day to confront those who strive to destroy us. God Bless the United States of America, this world’s last great hope for triumph over evil.

Yes, and as you remember the heroes, also remember the real struggle for freedom, and how men and women in all ages past have sought for power over their fellow man, and continue to fight wars and do treachery to gain power and monies, and yes, they do murder too.  Let’s not forget that the official theories do NOT add up, there is plenty of plausible doubt in that, and there are also some GLARING inconsistencies like the most obvious WT7, the third and relatively untalked about building that came down at demolition speed, and no plane hit it at all. Amazing inconsistency.
Remember that even in America we have had previous civil wars.  Remember that sometimes there are really bad people in charge, calling the shots. Remember that, and don’t be stoopid in the end.

I don’t know how you can criticize the videographer witness, at this point, when the crash was still burning, no one in the media had reported that some of the passengers, having spoken to relatives by cell phone, knew of the attacks and had decided to rush the cockpit and attempt to stop the hijackers, or bring the plane down if the only option. Had the plane been shot down by American armed forces perhaps the witness would have seen other jets flying in the area.

Kickagranma,
I have always liked reading your comments here on the blaze, and I agree our main focus is what is happening (or not happening) in Washington.
Like all Americans during the time immediately following 9/11, I was 100%on board with Bush, and the war in Afghanistan to “get the terrorists”. I separated all loyalty with Bush when I found out he and his administration lied about wmd in Iraq.  Those lies were the catalyst for my re-education regarding our Constitution and and our American Heritage. I am still learning.
The first time I saw the towers collapse, I gasped and said to my husband, “That was a demolition”.
There are so many unanswered questions surrounding that day.  The main piece of truth that I learned over the past 10 years is that fire did  not cause those towers to pancake…nor did fire cause building 7 to pancake.  
As we near the 10th anniversary of 9/11, my thoughts and pryers are with the families who lost loved ones and also with all those heroic first responders who lost their lives or were hurt trying to save others.  God bless them all.

I completely agree KG.  Bush did have his faults obviously, but I do feel he was the right man for the job during those moments.  For those who still believe that the towers, along with building 7, went down because of “an” explosion are so ignorant!  Go look at actual demolition videos of buildings and you’ll see that even for the smallest sky rise buildings that it took a lot of explosions to take the building down and those explosion were so obvious and noticeable!  All you here with from those people who try to claim that a coordinated demolition was the cause ALWAYS refer to the “one or few” explosions that can be heard.  How is one explosion or two or five going to take down structures like that of the twin towers and building 7?  GO TO YOUTUBE…. SEARCH BUILDING DEMOLITIONS VIDEOS.. and you will see how these types of buildings are TRULLY demolished.. here’s a perfect example…

Demolition charges are routinely built into massive skyscrapers.  It was decided in the early 40′s that if a large building in a downtown metropolitain area were to topple sideways during a fire, the damage to adjacent areas would be devastating.  Engineers and architects were worrid about this for decades.  In the mid-1960′s technology was to the point where buildings were routinely being brought down with explosives in controlled implosions.  It was decided that the twin towers needed to be outfitted with controlled demo charges built into them so they could be dropped into their own footprint if the need arose, to avoid collateral damage.  The charges were never armed until they were needed and could be detonated from a remote location. This ain’t fiction boys and girls it is engineering fact.  Deal with it!

His father was CIA head, his father started all the big wars in the middle east there starting at Kuwait, his father tried to usher in the NEW WORLD ORDER four times on national TV when he said, verbatim, “We are entering into a NEW WORLD ORDER” and he did that in 1990 when I witnessed it myself on national TV.

When demo experts want to take down a building, they can rig the explosives to make the building fall in the manner they want. If they need it to fall left, they can do that. They can make it fall to the right or just collapse and come straight down.
They don’t build explosives into buildings with some sort of secret trigger that can suddenly cause the building to collapse. There are no explosives built into buildings. None. You are an idiot for even suggesting that.

If George Bush was involved, don’t you think Obama would be yelling the proof from the rooftops?  He’s got access now.  Even Van Jones had access.  The more likely scenario is that the terrorists made double sure of the devestation by putting a bomb on board as well as aiming towards targets.  I researched a bit and any really hot fire (including forest fires) can cause a mushroom cloud, not just atomic weapons.  they said atomic weapons that hit the ground, don’t cause a mushroom cloud, only those detonated above the ground.

It saddens me that the Muslim propaganda machine is so effective. Folks, Islam is the most evil force ever unleashed on humanity. If Islam is not destroyed, Islam will destroy human consciousness FOREVER. In the search for truth, in the search for contact with God, there are two approaches, one, to set men free to perceive the truth, two, to condition the brain through repetition of thought, to set nerve cells in unalterable pathways through repetition of the same thoughts, complete robotic behavior in the path of repetition of religious dogma, the path of Islam.  Everything that can be done, must be done, to DESTROY Islam once and for all.  It is that serious.

I was in the military on 9/11 and then I volunteered for my 1st deployment at the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom and went back 2 more times before retiring.  I do not agree in any way with the Patriot Act, nor do I think that George Bush was both the dumbest President on the planet, yet somehow smart enough to have pulled this off.  9/11 was a terrorist attack that I do believe the Gov’t probably screwed some things up on and has probably hidden somethings to cover up their screw ups.  But yes….Jihadists planned and committed these attacks and they will do it again at some point.  The Government probably won’t be able to stop them, just react to them and probably make more mistakes that they will again, have to cover up…
However, don’t get so frustrated with the “Truthers”.  Its people like them, even the, “Birthers” that keep this Government in check.

2-Spet. 11, 2001 AA Flight 77 crashed: Pentagon, Washington D.C. (official story)
The FAA collected the 757 debris from the Buga, Co crash site. I would like to see the metal from the Buga crash tested against the metal from the Pentagon crash to determine if the metal parts came from the same aircraft. Pieces of the 757 Buga crash could have been used to sage the crash at the Pentagon on 9/11.

The USGS maps from 1994 show that.
The only thing at Shanksville was a large hole, most likely made by an MK-84 2000 lb. aircraft bomb.

Where were the TWO (2) holes from the impact of the Boeing 757 in the side of the Pentagon? There were NONE there!

I can see why they would be confiscated to bring someone to justice, but that’s over now for many years.  If there was a plane that hit the Pentagon, then show us the footage.  If a Ryder truck did that much damage to the OKC building with no bombs in the building, show us the footage.  I’m betting they cannot.

While workmen are putting the finishing touches on the Flight 93 memorial itself, funding for it is very much a work in progress. Congress has allocated about $14 million, but the memorial is still $10 million short of its $62 million price tag. And that‘s before you add on the cost of a visitor’s center and other design features that are planned for the site.
“The main challenge has perhaps more to do with geography than anything else,” says King Laughlin with the National Park Foundation, which is helping to raise private donations for the memorial. “Washington and New York are obviously large metropolitan areas. There‘s a large corporate presence in particular that’s very different than what you see in Shanksville. That’s a town of around 200 people.”

All I see is a puff of smoke. It looks like smoke from a MK 84 2000lb. bomb that I used to see dropped all the time in desert storm/shield.
Take a look at this aerial view of the same spot at Shankville, PA….before 9/11 and after 9/11.
Do you remember that crease/crater from what looked like the impact of the wings of the aircraft?
Well that crease/crater was NOT made by the aircraft’s wings. That crease/crater was there years before 9/11.
So the truth of it all is there was only one large hole made in the ground….NO wing makes were made.
Here’s the video proof of the pre existing marks (thought to be of the wings) on the ground back in 1994 from a USGS map of Shanksville, PA.

@naturesgod, Learn how to do some research and investigation on your own instead of looking at a video that claims to show what all plane crash sites look like. Planes crash at different speeds and angles, and one that is going straight down is going to look very different after it crashes than one where the pilot was trying to save the plane or even land it in a clearing, but failed.
Do you recall Jet Blue crash years ago…crashed into the ocean shortly after takeoff? Straight down and disintgrated upon hitting the water, because it was going so fast. Water caused it to disintegrate. 
You do not understand the physics, but you are willing to watch a couple minutes of propaganda video and come to a conclusion. Well, it looks like propaganda still works with some people.

That is the airplane crash where the plane supposedly “vaporized.”  There was literally not one piece of evidence that a plane hit there.  There was only a great big hole in the ground.  Makes you wonder what really happened.  Look at Lockerbie, Scotland where that 747 crashed and half the plane was still in tact.  You could see the cockpit and everything.  This crash, however, was literally vaporized where there was not once piece of a plane left.  It really makes no sense how this crash could have made an entire jet disappear.  I wouldn’t put it past our government to have blown it up with a missile and then deny it.  I‘m not saying that’s what happened, but it sure seems strange how a plan crashes and the only thing to show for it, at the time, was a big hole in the ground.  I don‘t think that’s ever happened before in the history of aviation where a giant aluminum jet is turned into dust hitting the ground.  Look up the video of the crash site moments after it happened and you‘ll see what I’m talking about.   http://stj911.org/evidence/flight93.html#photos

I see science is not your first job. A plane exploding in air will produce odd shaped pieces many of which which will lose their forward velocity due to wind resistance and fall to the ground at relatively low velocities. Only the larger sections would retain some of their forward velocity. What you would find on the ground looks like what they did find on the ground. An aluminum airframe is so fragile if you really knew you would be hesitant to fly. You can melt it on your stove top to **** and bend it to pieces. Flight 93 nosed over 600 MPH directly into the ground which would disintegrate it. What you would see on the ground amazingly would look like what they saw. The left ignores science over global warming. The right ignores science over conspiracy theories. Intelligent people do not spend their time thinking in nothing but extremes. Example: WTC flash just as aircraft hit is used to promote conspiracy. The hundreds of pounds of Depleted Uranium (DU) used in aircraft as ballast would vaporize the nose section upon impact the same way the DU in the tail section would. It would look like exactly what is seen on the videos yet so called ‘scientists’ use this flash to say bombs were planted. DU burns in air quite easily and in large amounts quite violently. If you did not know about the Uranium ballast no surprise, the public‘s 50’s B movie mindset about radiation precludes airlines wanting you to know of it’s existence on the airliners you fly.

Phantom II Posted on September 5, 2011 at 2:00pm
@Dr. Vel. They haven’t used that stuff since 85 in the US. It was not used as ballast. It was used for balancing control surfaces.  Aircraft that contain depleted uranium trim weights (Boeing 747–100 for example) may contain between 400 to 1,500 kg of DU.  It is not used any more because of environmental concerns if the aircraft were to crash. The metal oxidizes to a fine powder in a fire.  Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas discontinued using DU counterweights in the 1987. There Are aerodynamic solutions for flutter now in some applications. DU is recovered at crash sits if possible. DU Counterweights manufactured with cadmium plating are considered non-hazardous while the plating is intact. This too will be fazed when older designs are replaced.
There is always something left at a crash site, no matter the velocity and angle of the impact and the quantity of fuel on board. I’ve seen many crash sites with not a trace of debris, albeit at 500kts at 1000ft. Many recovered parts of a fighter taken down by a SAM or an AA missile will  remain intact. Rumsfeld has a piece of landing gear on his desk from the plane that hit the Pentagon.

A big crater with no debris in it implies a really big explosion on impact, and is more consistent with the official theory of a plane in a power dive with intact fuel tanks, than with the alternate theory of a midair explosion which would cause the plane to be in a slower free fall with much of its fuel already burned up.  Think of it this way – if you drop a garbage can off a fifty story building, you get a flat garbage can pretty close to where it hit.  If you blow up the same garbage can with a stick off dynamite, you get little pieces of garbage can all over the place.  If you could propel the garbage can toward the ground from the top of the fifty story building at several times its free fall velocity and with a stick of dynamite in it that would blow up on impact, you would find very little of it in the crater, and you would probably never find all of the pieces.  This looks different from all other crashes, because it is different from all other crashes.  In other crashes the plane is either in free fall, or under the control of a pilot who is trying not to crash.

Wow, amazing video. It helps you realize how real it truly was and how people didn’t know what it meant in the moment

A fresh perspective from a terrible moment.  This video shows the power of the explosion of the Twin Towers.

Will this be forbidden to be shown by the networks (as was footage of the planes striking the twin towers).

Your Legend of 9/11 video starts out with the definition of ‘legend’.  This film is only a legend … a myth – not fact.  You truthers need to give up on your mythical rhetoric, because it‘s all merely a figment of someone’s imagination on steroids, intended to be used by the radical lefts’ useful idiots.
You may also recall that when Obama was elected, the Democrats were out for blood.  One of the first things on his administration’s agenda was to charge Bush and Cheney with war crimes.  They were determined to prove the ‘myth’ and anything else that was connected to the myth.  Obviously, nothing happened, because they couldn’t find anything to prove their accusations.  It turned out to be a lie … like most everything else you hear from the radical lefts these days.

Bush and Cheney WERE guilty of war crimes. Multiple offenses against the Constitution of the United States. You can lump me with the Huffington Post if you want to ignorantly do so, but I am as conservative as they get, very libertarian, against all things global warming theory, I do not believe in evolution, and I am against social welfare. In other words, I am not a lib t a rd.
I am a realist.  I am a common senser.  I believe history repeats itself. I believe America is corrupting itself, and there ARE evil people in our borders.  Its just common sense, man.

@ Look4DBigPicture,   The candidates for the presidency will say anything to get into power.  For instance, anyone remember hearing Bush 1 say “no new taxes”?  Didn‘t we have the highest tax hike in ALL of our nation’s history while he was in?  We can’t believe anything politicians tell us.  All they are after is more terms and more money.
Peace

@thinkinghuman     You claim to be thinking and human, so if Bush and Cheney are guilty of war crimes, are Clinton and Obama also guilty of war crimes?
Clinton started rendition (shipping a prisoner to another country for torture– far worse than waterboarding) and Obama continues it. Obama kills civilians with drones in Pakistan…that is OK under the Geneva convention ? How is it anything other than a war crime to kill civilians with missiles shot from drones? We are not even in a military action against the country of Pakistan.
Bush and Cheney committed no war crimes. The left claims no war was declared, blah, blah, but Bush went to Congress. Obama did not go to Congress for Libya–  any issues with that?  You are just babbling the HuffPo nonsense, and just because you claim to be conservative or libertarian does not mean you have a clue. Your previous comment on Islam and the Constitution proves you don’t understand either, and now you add this to your list of things you don’t understand.

looseyloo, this is not about left or right.  Yes, both Sotero and Clinton are war criminals, just like Bush 2.  Left/Right, Black/White, Rich/Poor, Christian/Muslim, Thin/Fat, Young/Old.  All of these are distractions to keep your attention away from the fact that since 1913 our government has been in control of a devious group of people.
Look around us at the deteriorating conditions of our country.  We are slowly, now quickly, becoming a third world country.  Put down the game controller.  Turn off dancing with the stars.  Get out and look at what we have become.  (This last part was not directed at you specifically, looseyloo)
Peace

Magnolia Apostolic Tabernacle has already given away thousands of items since last Friday and will continue to reach out to help residents of this community who have lost much of their belongings due to this incredible fire. Contact Stacey Lynn, Church Administrator, or Steve Wehrle, Pastor of Magnolia Apostolic Tabernacle, at 281-252-8502 with any questions.

09/12/11 8 p.m.
UPDATE: 1486 and all roads off of 1486 are currently open, please use caution when traveling this road due to weakened trees and down powerlines. There are still many firefighters on scene in this area, please use extreme caution and drive safely and slowly. There is a possibility that 1486 could be closed tonight if smoke conditions increase and cause limited visibility. No evacuations will take place if this happens.

09/12/11 9 a.m.
UPDATE ... from Texas Forest Service and reporter Ford Atkinson ... The fires are 85 percent contained with 18,946 acres burned ... The City of Magnolia is having a community fire update meeting at 7 p.m. Monday at Unity Park on 19450 Unity Park Drive. The command center at Magnolia West High School will close sometime Monday.

09/12/11 10 a.m.
ROAD CLOSURES UPDATE ... from Montgomery County Sheriff's Office ...
Throughout the night fire fighters identified hot spots and worked to extinguish those. Early morning cooler temperatures can keep smoke close to the ground. Driving conditions in some areas were affected and visibility was greatly reduced. Extra driving caution is advised.

It appears that eight (8) homes were lost in Montgomery County and over twelve (12) exterior buildings. What was lost compared to what was saved and what could have been destroyed speaks of the enormous effort by the team that worked so hard to bring this fire into submission.
Without the cooperation, support, and determination by so many, not only the fire departments and law enforcements agencies, but the school district, state, surrounding counties, and the local communities this incident would have been more devastating.

09/11/11 11 a.m.
UPDATE ... from Texas Forest Service ...
Location: Montgomery, Waller and Grimes Counties, Texas
Date of Fire Start: September 5, 2011
Cause: Under Investigation
Size: 18,468 acres - acreage has been dropped due to more accurate G.P.S. measurements of the fire perimeter.
Containment: 65%- this number is based on the percentage of the fire perimeter that has secure lines around it. It is also a measure of confidence that fire supervisors have on the ability of these lines to hold the fire.
Management: Unified Command (Texas Forest Service, Grimes County, Waller County, Montgomery County, and California Incident Management Team 4).
Fire Status: The Riley Road Fire activity was moderate on Saturday thanks to the significant progress made in line improvements during the Friday night shift. Fire activity did pick up in the afternoon, as the temperatures increased and the relative humidity decreased. Several small spotovers ignited across the lines on Saturday, but were quickly contained by the unified front of air and ground resources. Black Hawk Helicopters, air tankers and volunteer engines doused spotovers as soon as they occurred. Activity along the western edge of the fire was light throughout the day. Overall fire crews had a very successful day. Overnight fire intensity was again reduced due to increasing moisture from the southerly sea breeze allowing night operations to continue make significant progress on line improvement and mop up operations.
Firefighters will continue to improve fire lines today and mop up any hot spots along the fire edge, focusing on the 100 feet into the fire interior. Firefighters will also be fireproofing around existing homes inside of the burned area protect them from any unburned fuels. With westerly winds predicted for the afternoon, the eastern edge of the fire will be the most critical area for firefighters to work. Total Aircraft resources on the fire include: 4 Single Engine Air tankers (SEATS), 4 C-130 air tankers, 4 Black Hawk Helicopters, 1 Type One Helitanker, one DC-10 Air Tanker, 1 Type Two Helicopter, and 1 Type Three Helicopter.
Resources: Total Personnel: 698
Structures Damaged or Destroyed: 23 damaged / 60 destroyed

09/11/11 10:30 a.m.
UPDATE ... from Grimes County Sheriff's Office Facebook page ... The Texas Forest Service now shows the Riley Road Fire to be the #3 priority fire in Texas and the Nation. The total acreage burned for the Tri-County area is shown at 21,619. According the TFS report, no additional acreage was lost in the past 24 hours. The overall containment for the Riley Road fire is currently listed at 40 percent.

09/11/11 10:30 a.m.
 ROAD CLOSURES UPDATE ... from Montgomery County Office of Emergency Management ...
The roadways and evacuated areas in Montgomery County remain closed. Bull dozers are being used to create fire breaks and many areas are showing signs of progress. Any increase in wind velocity greatly enhances the possibilities of fire flare-ups and hampers extinguishing measures. Afternoon fire containment and/or expansion will affect the time frame to open evacuated areas.
Utility companies are being allowed access to these areas to begin assessments to restore those services.

09/10/11 3:43 p.m.
EVACUATION/ROAD CLOSURES UPDATE ... from from Montgomery County Fire Marshal's Office Facebook page ...

FIRE STATUS UPDATE... from FOX 26's Isiah Carey: Thousands of acres of land destroyed, 75 houses gutted, and now people are waiting to get back into their properties after that huge fire in a three county area just north of Houston. The fire began Monday afternoon scorching at least 7500 acres of land in Montgomery, Grimes, and Waller counties. At least 4,000 homes were under a mandatory evacuation order where there was a threat of grass fires. Wes Suggs walked his horses across 16 miles of Montgomery couny because he had no trailer. Like thousands of others he's trying to stay one step ahead of the fire. But he's already lost one round no trailer and home. Sbuggs says, "my house burned down at about 5....it's black over there." " I walked into my yard...they can't force me to leave," said Montgomery, Texas resident Paula Dowries. She's defiant to the end with motivation some may or may not understand.

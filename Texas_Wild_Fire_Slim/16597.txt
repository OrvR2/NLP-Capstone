Help Central Texas Wildfire Victims--2 dollars per sale--Be Thankful Bird in Yellow
From teachergurrl
 









 

            I'm a native Texan, have lived here all my life, and we've never experienced such a devastating drought and wildfire season.  Areas throughout the state are burning, and thousands of people have lost everything they own.  ON Wednesday, SEPTEMBER 14, 2011, I will donate 50% of all sales of this print to the American Red Cross of Central Texas.  This effort is being coordinated by Bri at Homespun Houston (http://www.homespunhouston.com/2011/09/call-to-action/)--read more about her effort here.Furthermore, THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, I'll donate $2 from every sale of this print to the effort.  Now--more about the print itself!This 8" x 10" print features a funky little bird that I painted long-ago, digitally enhanced and combined with a wonderful saying that embodies the spirit and courage that the fire victims (along with everyone else) need to keep in mind: "Be thankful for one thing every day."I'll print it just for you on my groovy Epson Stylus Photo R2000 printer using awesome archival inks.  It'll be packaged in a cello bag and mailed in a stay-flat mailer.  The print image will be 8" x 10" with a white border on 8.5" x 11" art paper.Choose from several colors: Camel Yellow, Mint Green, Snow White, Bubblegum Pink, or Lovely Lavender.  (You can either choose a specific listing in my shop, or let me know your color choice in the notes to seller.)Thank you SO MUCH for your support, and for blessing the Heart of Texas!

Enjoying his music is one thing, but knowing all he did to improve techniques for guitar and recording music, spending his life innovating, inventing and succeeding - our top guitar people have the utmost respect for this music genius.  RIP music man!

Les Paul is turning in his grave right now at the Obama administration and the EPA as a total disgrace for the restrictions they are putting on importing the wood for their guitars.

....meanwhile back at the factory in Memphis....
The Feds are seizing wood for some obscure foreign law to kill more American jobs.
I bet old Les is turing over in his grave as we speak.

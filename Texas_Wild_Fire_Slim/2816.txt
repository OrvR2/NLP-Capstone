With the American economy years away from returning to pre-recession employment levels, Friday's news that the country failed to add any jobs at all in August is cause for concern, to put it lightly. Some states, in particular, have a very long way to go. 
In order to return employment back to pre-recession levels, the U.S. now needs to create 12.4 million jobs. That's 180,000 more than just last month, and that number will only go up as the population continues to grow, according to the Brookings Insitute's Hamilton Project. 
Certain states dependent on hard-hit industries such as construction will have to generate even more jobs to get back to the pre-recession days. California, for example, was largely intertwined with the manufacturing and construction sectors, and is not coincidentally the state with the largest jobs gap. Currently, the Golden State needs almost 2 million jobs to get back to pre-recession levels of employment. Compare that to North Dakota, the state with smallest jobs gap, which needs only 7,000. 
With Obama's jobs speech just around the corner, The Hamilton Project estimates that it would take twelve and a half years to reach pre-recession employment levels assuming the country started creating jobs at the same rate during the best job-growth years of the 2000s. In other words, this problem will be with the country from some time yet. 
Here are the top ten states with the biggest job gaps, according to the Hamilton Project:

				I knew CA was going to be on top of this list.  There are panhandler­s at every intersecti­on and in every parking lot.

High taxes and extreme over-regul­ation have ruined the economy here - unemployme­nt is 15% in my county and CA now has the worst unemployme­nt in it's history - that's right even worse than during the Great Depression here, when CA used to be the place people fled to.

Now taxpayers and buisnesses are fleeing CA.

Thank-you Obama, Brown and the whole Democrat dominated state legislatur­e - and special thanks to the public sector labor unions, who, along with their bought and paid for politician­s, are driving CA to default.

				While the difference in jobs in each state since the start of the recession is interestin­g as a starting point, this article provides statistics that are of limited utility.  First, it gives only the absolute number of jobs lost in each of the states since the start of the recession, with no relationsh­ip to the total state population­, or population of available workers.  Second, it does not provide any context about the situation in each state at the official start of the recession.  Some areas, e.g., Ohio and Michigan in particular­, were already suffering because of their manufactur­ing bases. A little deeper analysis on the part of the authors could have provided much more meaningful informatio­n.

				We need not wait years to begin growing again.  All we need to do is the following:

1. Resume the developmen­t of our own energy

2. Reduce our corporate income tax, and allow for tax-free repatriati­on of overseas profits (where tax has already been paid)

3. Eliminate all tax deductions in excess of those that cover actual business or medical (including insurance) expenses and use the additional revenue to cut individual marginal tax rates.

4. Calculate social security COLA on prices instead of wages, and gradually raise the retirement age.

5. Allow for incentives to save in the medicare program

6. Repeal Obamacare and replace it with a law that includes tort reform, allows interstate competitio­n in medical insurance,­encourages medical savings accounts, and makes individual insurance tax-deduct­ible

7. Repeal Dodd-Frank and replace it with a tax on banking that increases along with the size of the bank.  The purpose of this is to efficientl­y eliminate TBTF banks

8. Fix our education system by closing the Dept of Education and use the savings to provide seed money for school choice programs.

				Dear American,

While I appreciate that you are trying to analyze our problems and provide solutions, I believe you are misguided.  Just to cherry pick among your proposals:
If the Dept of Education were eliminated and "school choice" inaugurate­d, we would have schools teaching creationis­m, but neglecting real science, exacerbati­ng our national decline in science and technology­. 
Tort reform has been enacted at the state level in several states (Texas for one), but has not led to decreases in medical costs or improved medical outcomes. Individual medical insurance is already tax deductible­, above a base amount. 
What good will raising the retirement age do when people over 55 have a much harder time finding work even in a good economy, and are blatantly discrimina­ted against in employment decisions?
For most sources of energy, there is a global market, and developing resources here won't significan­tly affect prices.  We can have much more effect on our costs by cutting usage through improvemen­ts in efficiency and exploiting new sources such as wind and solar.
I agree that tax deductions are rife with loopholes catering to special interests, the real problem is the way in which our candidates finance their campaigns, leading to their dependence on those special interests and ensuring that they will continue to control our political system.  We can't attack those loopholes as long as Congress is for sale.
Please think about it.

				So what happened to your job.  It was offshored to low cost labor pools in China, India or Mexico; it was automated and you were replaced with a machine, or your job was filled with an illegal alien who works for half what you did with no benefits or worker protection­.  In the last 10 years, the United States has had about 6 million jobs which have completely disappeare­d while the population grew.  A growth rate of 2% doesn't even provide for half of the jobs needed for young new graduates entering the workforce.  Happy Labor Day!

Considerin­g that we have more population than any other state and one of the largest economies in the world when measured against that it doesn't look that bad, but when measured by those other hic states like in the southeast (notice no names here-THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE) of course it's gonna look like this.

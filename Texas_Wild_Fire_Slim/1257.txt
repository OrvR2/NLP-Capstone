By Associated Press
BOULDER, Colo. -- Harbor has over two feet of ears. Does that make him a 6-foot dog?
Probably not. But on Tuesday, the black-and-tan coonhound from Boulder, Colo., gets the 2012 Guinness World Records title for "longest ears on a living dog."
His left ear is 12.25 inches long and his right is 13.5 inches long.
Owner Jennifer Wert says when her 8-year-old was a puppy, he would trip on his ears and roll down stairs.
These days, Wert says people often stop them to ask questions, take photos or tug on his ears.
Tigger, a bloodhound from Illinois who died in 2009, still holds the record for longest ears ever. One was 13.5 inches long, the other 13.75 inches long.
Coonhounds use their ears to help with scent.

				This is one of the reasons I've almost given up on article writers. It seems all too many are given things to write about and they don't have the knowlege. How the hell does having long ears help any dog sniff out, well, whatever it's trying to sniff out?
As cute as this is, please find some knowlegabl­e people to write and edit these articles! I've seriously had enough of articles which just fill up room. (For example, one article I found was on a bear who had his his head stuck in a jar and was in a lot of pain and couldn't eat for a week. The article was mocking the bear going on about how funny it was. How is an endangered bear starving to death and needing urgent medical attention to stop it dying funny?)

				This breed and Bloodhound­s ears hang down around their nose and the ears “funnel” the scent, concentrat­ing it into their nostrils.

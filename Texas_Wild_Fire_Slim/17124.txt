	The flu often comes on suddenly, and may include the following symptoms:


		Fever

		Headache

		Fatigue

		Cough

		Sore throat

		Runny or stuffy nose

		Body aches

		Stomach ailments (nausea and diarrhea), more common in children than adults


	Having some of these flu symptoms does not necessarily mean you have been infected
	with the flu, as these can also be related to other illnesses.

	How do I know if I have the flu?


	If you have a sudden appearance of some or all of the flu symptoms listed above
	during the typical flu season,
	you may have the flu. However, symptoms alone are not enough to diagnose the flu.
	Doctors do have diagnostic tests that can identify influenza, but the tests must
	be administered in the first few days of your illness.

Courtesy: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

	How can I protect my children from getting the flu?


	To protect your children from getting influenza, teach them to:


		Cover their nose and mouth when coughing and/or sneezing. If a tissue is used, it
		should be thrown away.

		Wash their hands often with soap and water, especially after coughing or sneezing
		into them.

		Keep hands away from their eyes, nose, and mouth to prevent the spread of germs.


	The best method of flu prevention
	is to have your children get the flu vaccine.

	If your child (including teenagers) has flu-like symptoms, do not give him/her aspirin
	to treat those symptoms (especially a fever), as influenza and aspirin can be associated
	with a a rare but serious disease, Reye syndrome. Children with the flu should get
	lots of rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take medicines that do not contain aspirin.

	How should I treat the flu?


	If you get the flu, you should get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, avoid the
	use of tobacco and alcohol, and take medications to treat your symptoms.

	Doctors can prescribe antiviral
	drugs to help treat the disease.

It was a long haul weekend what with FYF on Saturday, (YACHT was epic, DFA was epically loud), the Identity Festival on Sunday, (that Steve Aoki has major stage presence), and whatever you did on Monday to celebrate Labor Day, (and I sincerely hope it involved resting your tired feet while eating something prepared on a grill). You thus have permission to take Tuesday off to adjust back into work mode and organize yourself for another week of sonic adventures in the city of angels.

		  		Wednesday, September 7: The Muddy Reds @ Central S.A.P.C.

What excites you more, hearing the booze-soaked raucous Americana roots rock of LA's own Muddy Reds, or the fact that in Central S.A.P.C., Santa Monica finally has a venue to support this brand of loud, local indie rock? If you're answer is "both dummy," get yourself to Central on hump day for a shot of whiskey and a hell of a good time.
9pm, $7
Central S.A.P.C., 1348 14th Street, at Santa Monica Boulevard, Santa Monica (310-451-5040 or centralsapc.com)

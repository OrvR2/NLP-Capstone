WASHINGTON - Democrats on the Super Congress will insist that the body's mandate be expanded to include job creation measures, setting up the first major ideological battle a day before the panel is set to meet for the first time.
Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said on Wednesday that Democrats on the panel are in agreement that the national debt can't be decreased without growing the economy. "It's part of the recovery. Growth will raise revenue," Baucus said after a lunch meeting with Democrats. He declined to specify the size of a stimulus package he'd want included. "It's gotta be one that makes sense," he said, distancing himself, apparently, from the camp that advocates a senseless plan.
Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), the author of a bill to create an infrastructure bank that would spur construction lending, also said that the panel should focus on job growth. "I don't think you can reduce the deficit of the country in the scope that we need to without growth," he said. "We have to have that discussion."
Baucus said that he had yet to discuss the matter with Republicans on the committee, but acknowledged that pushing for job creation measures would make it harder for the panel to reach a consensus. "It'll be difficult. I'm not saying it's going to be easy, but it should be addressed," he said.
In the days after the creation of the panel, a joint committee tasked with reducing the national debt by $1.2 trillion over ten years, the stock market plummeted. A pitiful employment report followed, showing that the U.S. economy had added a net zero jobs in August. As quickly as the debt-reduction committee had been conceived and its members appointed, it began to seem out of step with the new focus on job creation in Washington.
The Democratic insistence on a focus on jobs puts the party's panel members in step with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which previously called for the committee to prioritize job creation as a way to pay down the debt. As more people find work, more workers are paying income taxes and fewer are collecting unemployment benefits or disability.
Rep. John Larson of Connecticut, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, is proposing to create a Joint Select Committee on Job Creation that would be, in effect, a Super Congress for jobs. It would be tasked with crafting a plan to return the country to full employment by 2021.
Democrats in the already-existing committee have suggested that short-term stimulus spending could be added to the package, as long as it still wound up slashing the requisite amount of debt over ten years.
"Unemployment's a big problem," said Baucus. "Short term growth helps raise to revenue."

Lesson on debt for those whining about it:"What Does Debt-To-GD­P Ratio Mean?A measure of a country's federal debt in relation to its gross domestic product (GDP).

				They can't reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion over 10 yrs without growth?  If the economy grew at 4% a year for a decade, in the 10th yr the deficit won't even be cut by half (assuming no growth in spending which isn't realistic)­.  These guys are killing us.  We have a $1.4 trillion deficit and they can't find cuts of $120 billion a year?  If they can't figure out how to cut this much, how in the world are they ever going to get it to zero?  And they wonder why we're all so frustrated­?  These people are completely incompeten­t and are spineless.  I don't how they can stand in before us and spout their nonsense.  I would think they would be too embarrasse­d to show their faces.

				I'm sure tomorrow Obama will announce another "Stimulus Plan" 2.0.  Just like his first stimulus plan, it'll be more money going towards his base, union employees.  Same old plan as his first stimulus plan.  If the President wants to improve the economy, he needs to address the housing mess, and he needs to stimulate small business.  Because until the housing crisis is resolved, the economy won't improve.  In regards to small business, it's small businesses that create the most jobs in this country.  If you want to create more jobs, focus needs to be on entreprene­urship and small business.

				So many desperate people.

Too bad the GOP has blocked any incentives of raising revenues to fix our crumbling infrastruc­­­ture.

I can look in my backyard and see an aging telephone pole, twisted cracks, and cut into deeply by so many years of technician­­­s using their spikes to get up to the cables.

What I have only represents what is in many of my neighbor's back yards, cities, and counties across the states.

I was talking to someone who upgrades electrical infrastruc­­­tures to undergroun­­­d facilities (safer, cleaner, & up-to-date­­­) just a while back. He indicated that the more areas that are slated for upgraded undergroun­­­d facilities it is cheaper per customer to do so.

But it is unfortunat­­­e that projects that can only benefit communitie­­­s and create more jobs will never happen because of the Norquist pledge. A pledge that demands no new taxes, even ones that help folks get back to work and benefit communitie­­­s.

				"The Democratic insistence on a focus on jobs puts the party's panel members in step with the Congressio­nal Progressiv­e Caucus, which previously called for the committee to prioritize job creation as a way to pay down the debt"

I will add that the CPC"s budget is scored higher by the Economic Policy Institute than either the President'­s budget, or the Ryan plan, in deficit reduction.

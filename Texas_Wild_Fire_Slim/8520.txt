The Gadhafi family in focusBy Mike KrumboltzMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz | The Envoy – Tue, Aug 30, 2011This split image shows Gadhafi's daughters, Aisha in 2011, left, and Hana in 1996, right. (AP/Pier Paolo/Lino …Ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi remains in hiding and continues to draw massive online interest. Also huge on the Web over the past several weeks: his family.
According to Algerian diplomats, Gadhafi's wife, three of his children, and several of his grandchildren have fled to Algeria, west of Libya. And while official news is understandably scant regarding the Gadhafi clan's specific movements and activities, some bits of information have found their way to the Web.
Drawing the most online interest are two of Gadhafi's daughters. Aisha Gadhafi, Moammar's only biological daughter, gave birth to a baby girl on Tuesday, shortly after crossing over to Algeria. According to an article from CNN, Aisha had been expected to deliver in September, making the baby a bit early.
Unlike some of her siblings, Aisha largely stayed out of the public eye during her father's reign as leader of Libya. A lawyer, she ran a charitable foundation in Libya and assisted in the defense of Saddam Hussein, during his trial in 2004. She also defended the man accused of throwing his shoe at President George W. Bush.

The announcement came as the brother of a prominent Washington,  D.C.-based Syrian opposition activist and scholar, Radwan Ziadeh, was  arrested by the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and a day after a video appeared on  YouTube showing Robert Ford, the American ambassador to Syria, being manhandled while on an Aug. 23 visit to the Syrian city of Jassem by two pro-Assad demonstrators, as first reported Monday by Foreign Policy. (You can see the YouTube video below.)

The Treasury Department announced Tuesday that it is sanctioning the Damascus regime's foreign minister, as well as Syria's ambassador to Lebanon, Ali Abdul Karim Ali, and Assad's presidential and media adviser, Bouthaina Shaaban.
Under the sanctions, Americans "are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with any of the designees and any assets they may have subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen," the Treasury Department said. The sanctions also restrict the foreign minister's opportunities to travel to the United States outside of United Nations business in New York.
"Building on our sanctions targeting the entire Government of Syria, we are bringing additional pressure to bear today directly on three senior Asad regime officials who are principal defenders of the regime's activities," the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, David S. Cohen, said in a press release Tuesday.
Syrian pro-democracy activist Radwan Ziadeh, a Syrian scholar based at George Washington University, confirmed in an email to the Envoy Tuesday that his brother was taken into custody by Syrian Air Force security personnel Tuesday.Read More »Obama kicks off 9/11 anniversary commemorations by honoring veteransBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Tue, Aug 30, 2011(Carolyn Kaster/AP)In Minneapolis today, President Barack Obama gave the first in a series of speeches marking the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The president spoke before a crowd of 6,000 veterans at the American Legion's national convention.
In his remarks, Obama called for Americans to honor the solemn anniversary by performing national service, and repeatedly praised the nobility of the 5 million Americans who have served in the U.S. military since 9/11. He called these soldiers and their families members of the "9/11 generation." Obama also expressed humble gratitude for the sacrifice of more than 6,200 American servicemen and women who have been killed in conflict since 9/11.
"In a decade of war, they have borne an extraordinary burden, with more than two million of our service members deploying to the warzones," Obama said in his speech at the Minneapolis Convention Center.  "Hundreds of thousands have deployed again and again, year after year.  Never before has our nation asked so much of our all-volunteer force—that 1 percent of Americans who wears the uniform."
Watch highlights from the speech via ABC News here:

Obama also expressed the need for the United States to shift its focus from war-fighting abroad to nation-building at home.Read More »With 66 killed, August becomes deadliest month in 10-year Afghanistan warBy Phoebe Connelly | The Envoy – Tue, Aug 30, 2011(Brennan Linsley/AP)
August has been the deadliest month in the nearly 10-year long war in Afghanistan: Sixty-six  U.S. troops have been killed so far this month, according to the Associated Press.
Killed Al Qaeda figure was key communications link for terrorist networkBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Mon, Aug 29, 2011Atiyah abd al-Rahman. (State Department)When senior American officials confirmed Saturday that a senior al Qaeda operative, Atiyah abd al-Rahman, had been killed in Waziristan, Pakistan last week, familiar headlines proclaiming that "al Qaeda #2 official killed" flashed around the world. But Atiyah abd al-Rahman was not a figure of global notoriety, like Osama bin Laden, who was killed by U.S. commandos in May, and bin Laden's designated successor Ayman al-Zawahiri.
Nevertheless, counterterrorism analysts say that the significance of Atiyah's loss to al Qaeda has, if anything, been understated.
"While there is no doubt that bin Laden's death was the more significant blow politically, Atiyah's death may have a larger impact on how the al-Qaeda network functions," writes counterterrorism analyst Brian Fishman at Foreign Policy.com's AfPak channel.
Atiyah, who was born in Misrata, Libya around 1970 and served with bin Laden in Afghanistan in the 1980s, was a key communications link connecting al Qaeda cells hunkered down in Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and North Africa, Fishman explains. "Atiyah was not the ultimate decision-maker," Fishman writes, "but he was the information crossroads."Read More »

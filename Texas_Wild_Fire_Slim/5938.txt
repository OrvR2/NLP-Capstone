JERUSALEM — Rising tensions with some of its closest and most important allies have left Israel increasingly isolated ahead of a momentous vote on Palestinian independence at the United Nations.
Troubles with Turkey, Egypt and even the U.S. are adding to Israel's headaches ahead of the vote, which is shaping up to be a global expression of discontent against the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The Palestinians plan to ask the United Nations this month to recognize their independence in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem – areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war – probably by embracing them as a "nonmember observer state." The measure is expected to pass overwhelmingly in the U.N. General Assembly.
The assembly's decisions are not legally binding, so the vote will be largely symbolic. But the Palestinians hope the measure will increase the already considerable pressure on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories, and add leverage should peace talks resume. The Palestinians refuse to negotiate while Israel continues to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.
Ghassan Khatib, a spokesman for the Palestinian government in the West Bank, said Israeli isolation is playing right into Palestinian hands. "We are seeing that result in increased support for us in the United Nations," he said.
On Wednesday, China announced it would support the Palestinian bid. And a French Mideast envoy, Valerie Hoffenberg, said she had been fired after publicly arguing against the Palestinian initiative. France has not publicly said how it will vote, but her comments signaled that the government favors the Palestinians.
The vote is seen by many not only as a message of sympathy with the Palestinians, but also a barometer of discontent with Israel's settlement policies. Some 500,000 Israelis now live in territories claimed by the Palestinians.
"There's no question that had Israel been seen as a country doing its utmost to promote peace, no such vote would be taking place," said Yossi Beilin, Israel's former deputy foreign minister.
Beilin cited Netanyahu's refusal to extend a freeze on new settlement construction a year ago as the "mother of all sins" that put him at odds with the international community. The decision, made over the very public objections of President Barack Obama, caused a brief round of peace talks to collapse.
Since then, relations with Obama have been further strained. In May, Netanyahu paid a tense visit to Washington, where he objected before cameras to Obama's call that the 1967 boundaries be the basis of a future agreement with the Palestinians. American officials privately express deep frustration with Netanyahu.
Even so, Washington has been trying to pressure the Palestinians to give up the U.N. bid, saying peace can only be achieved through negotiations.
Closer to home, Israel has watched Egypt, perhaps its most critical regional ally, cool relations since the ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak in February. Mubarak was seen by many of his people as too sympathetic to Israel, negotiating an unpopular deal to supply it with natural gas, for example.
Israel-Egypt relations took a hit last month when five Egyptian police were killed during a firefight between Israeli forces and fleeing militants. Egypt was outraged, and mass demonstrations against Israel erupted in Cairo. Israel later apologized. But there have been calls in Egypt to cancel the 30-year-old peace agreement with Israel – which is an absolutely critical element of Israel's regional strategy.
Another key regional ally, Turkey, has greatly curbed diplomatic and trade ties with Israel following Israel's deadly raid on a protest flotilla that tried to breach the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip last year. Nine Turks, one of them an American citizen, were killed in clashes with Israeli naval commandos.
Israeli officials have tried to play down the tensions, saying that Israel has long faced hostility on the diplomatic stage. They also say that Israel has enjoyed some key victories recently, such as last week's U.N. report on the flotilla incident that defended its blockade of Gaza. Yet one official acknowledged the "new challenges" are a source of concern. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing sensitive internal discussions.
Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the U.N. who is close to Netanyahu, said it is "a mistake to judge Israel's international standing by recent events."
He said Turkey's animosity toward Israel is part of a broader shift by the country's Islamist government that "is troubling not just for the Jewish state but for many of Turkey's neighbors."
And any anti-Israel resolution at the U.N. passes automatically, thanks to the dominance by developing nations that are sympathetic to the Palestinians, he said. "It's conventional wisdom that if there was a resolution whose first clause was anti-Israel and whose second clause was that the earth was flat, it would pass," Gold said.
Israeli opposition leader Tzipi Livni, however, accused Netanyahu of weakening the nation's interests. "Israel's isolation is affecting its security and its economy," she told a conference Wednesday.

				There are reports about Hamas denying students the right to study abroad and people with medical conditions the right to seek treatment if they don't bribe the right Hamas official.  It has always been said that PLO big shots had expensive cars and their kids went to prestigiou­s western universiti­es.  The PLO wouldn't take care of the garbage, and lived in luxorious villas.  Has Hamas turned corrupt?  Hamas seems to be worse than the Egyptians.

				I'm sorry but until people admit that there is no Palestine there cannot truly be movement forward.  Palestine and Israel both were destroyed years ago, and after World War II, Israel was recreated.  Kind of like AT&T was Cingular and not it is AT&T.  Palestine doesn't exist.  There are a group of people who maybe descendent­s of Palestine who live in a piece of land that is where Palestine may have been, but there is no Palestine to speak of now.

				Sounds like Israel's stubbornne­ss and arrogance has gotten it into deep doodoo. 

In exchange for some sort of release from liability, if I were Israel I'd sit down with the Palestinia­ns and work out a deal immediatel­y where their proposed state is recognized and welcomed and I'd come up with some realistic borders. 

As far as the settlers go, if they don't want to return to Israel and they want to live in what they call "Eretz Yisrael", (the biblical Land of Israel), let them stay where they are in Palestine. Israel has about 1.5 million Arabs. Palestine can have a half a million Jews. No one ever said that Eretz Yisrael needs to be governed by Israel. 

Israel has got to get back to where it used to be when it was a democracy before they ceded power to their religious and their soviets.

This is not happening; witness the French firing. We followed their lead in Libya; do you think they would not reciprocat­e if really pressured by the Obama Administra­tion?
Obama is not lifting a finger to help Israel after they had the temerity to defy his order to halt building.

				I agree that the Palestinia­ns should have a state of their own, but what happens the first time a rock.et comes out of Gaza and strikes Israel? Or do you believe once Hamas has its own state they will cease all at.tacks on Israel? How about the other radical factions in Gaza, will they stop their at.tacks too? Who will you blame then? Will it still be Israel's fault?

What happens then? Israel retaliates­, more rock.ets come in and on and on. Nothing will change until the Palestinia­ns recognize Israel's right to exist. Once that is done, everyhting else can be worked out. So far Hamas refuses to do that, and Israel refuses to deal with Hamas.

We can play the blame game all day, but the bottom line is that both sides lose if they don't come to an agreement.

				Well, Ban K. Moon stacked the deck on the Libya assault, stacked the commission on the Flotilla Report and how should it have been otherwise when he’s nothing more than a western stooge or lackey… just about in the same boat as Obama who also sold out to AIPAC and Wall Street… “one in the same.” I just hope Turkey does not fall into the same trap and back away eating crow in return for economic or other material compensati­on. The world does not need another wider war that could easily come about as a result of Israel’s attitude and behavior. I cannot think of any nation of the last century that has cried “wolf” any time another nation has spoken of the deeds of Israel against the Palestinia­ns. Israel has only been able to do this because of U.S. backing. Egyptians should keep their eyes on their revolution that it’s not taken from them while they’re dancing in the street’s adn taking in soccer games. Hillary Clinton is about to make another pitch…

				This is news? The spoiled brat of the middle east will finally get its nose rapped in the UN for its awful behavior toward the Palestinia­ns. End the occupation already and stop being a thorn in America's butt.

				The issue, unfortunat­ely, has been that the Palestinia­ns have had this policy of destroying Israel and haven't, other than Messrs. Abbaas and Fayyad, agreed to give up the project.

				Finally, since the 1960's they have had more than 67 resolution­s against them at the UN.  And they have vocally ignored each and every one of them. Saddam on had what, 12, and we invaded and took over the whole country.

				Imagine growing up in a city that has forever had foreign tanks and military people with guns occupying your city. Imagine never being free to travel from city to city or state to state for as long as you could remember.  Imaging having electricit­y never fully on.  What would you do.  Throwing rocks at tanks has not worked.  The most effective weapon you have is your life ... in a vest.  Yes, they kill themselves much like the Buddists did in Viet Nam.

It's time for a military pull-out and begin to right this wrong.

				If there is a "God," he would undoubtedl­y smile upon whatever country is able to reign in that odious little country of Israel and force them to return to respectabl­e borders, as in pre-'67, consequent­ly allowing the Palestinia­ns to finally have their own country. Until then, expect nothing but worldwide turmoil, Islamo-ter­rorism, and endless American involvemen­t in Middle-Eas­tern wars resulting from our interminab­le support for Israel. How depressing is that?

				"If there is a "God," he would undoubtedl­­y smile upon whatever country is able to reign in that odious little country of Israel..."

On account of Him not being able to do so Himself?

"and force them to return to respectabl­­e borders...­."

Which borders are those?  Hamas seems to have some ideas about that.  Do you agree with theirs?

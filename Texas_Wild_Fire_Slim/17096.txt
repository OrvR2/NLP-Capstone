@tarara666 ...This is the worst﻿ one year drought and heat wave in Texas history. Fifty days in a row above 100 degrees with NO rain. Thousands of Volunteer firefighters but they are stretched thin fighting all the different fires. They say blame the weather pattern 'el nina.' The Jet Stream in Northern U.S. causing flooding there and heat wave here in Texas. Thanks for your reply.

@tarara666
It's Texas, hot weather isn't uncommon here. Hot weather isn't what causes the fires though.This year we've had the worst drought(in Texas history) ever, so everything is very very dry/dead, which﻿ is a perfect breeding ground for fire if somebody were to accidentally flick a cigarette onto the ground or simply cause a small spark that hits the ground.

@tarara666 ....That is 20 miles by 25 miles of 200 foot tall flames in thick forest. The fire is so hot that the trees are exploding. One of my favorite﻿ Parks in Texas. Gone :, (

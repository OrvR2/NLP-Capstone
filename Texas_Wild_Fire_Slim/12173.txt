This was the summer of insects in the food world. Dana Goodyear wrote a piece on entomophagy -- insect eating -- in the New Yorker, Daniella Martin wrote one here on HuffPost Food and Angelina Jolie said her children eat crickets "like Doritos." So far, the activity has been mostly rhetorical -- people have been giving lip service to the ecological benefits of eating insects, but not that many people have actually been converted.
But now, the European Commission is putting money where all these foodie mouths are. It is offering a massive £2.65 million ($4.32 million) prize to the group that comes up with the best idea for developing insects as a popular food. The Commission is counting on cattle and other large animals being an increasingly untenable source of protein in decades to come, and hopes that some research group will be able to devise ways to convince people to eat insects despite the inherent "yuck" value. 
The EC is also helping support a project by the UK Food Standards agency to investigate the nutritional value of insects. Insect meat is much lower in fat, and higher in calcium, than beef or pork. But the UK study is looking especially hard at any risks presented by eating insects.
If you want to taste insects yourself before they become the default meat for recipes of the future, you have a many options. You can go to Oaxaca, Mexico where crickets and grasshoppers have long been a staple on taco menus. You can visit a state fare, where maggot sandwiches are an up-and-coming delicacy. Or you can stop buy the grocery store and pick up a package of Nathan's frankfurters -- a recent lawsuit alleges that insects are an increasingly standard ingredient in hot dogs.
And if you want to see how culinary insects are raised, check out this video of a farm in Laos.

				My property is only a tenth of an acre but I've shown my kids that they can eat the dandelions­, onions, roses, and black berries that all grow wild along our back yard fence. We have plenty of eatable insects but I've never tried that. This article makes me want to see what assortment of bugs I can gather to freak out my wife and kids with.

				For a number of years the Jardin Botanique in Montreal used to host an insect tasting event. 
We went 3 or 4 times, and I swore I would never eat bugs, but I'm adventurou­s and wound up trying it.
It wasn't as bad as I'd feared. There was only 1 thing that was really off-puttin­g. Most of the bugs were small, and crunchy, sort of like eating rice krispies or popcorn.
Penn State University does something similar once a year also.
We all eat hundreds of pounds of bugs in our food every year without knowing it, what's the big deal?
And about those hot dogs- that's why I stick with Hebrew National- they answer to a higher authority.­.. LOL

				These people don't gut the bugs!   That means you are eating the bug's intestine & its uncleaned contents.  I sure hope the bugs you scoff down don't have even smaller parasites inside themselves­.  A hundred hookworm eggs would be just about the size of a grain of sand.

				Hookworms live in the gut of mammals like dogs and cats. They are also present in soil.
From Wikipedia:
"Infection of the host is by the larvae, not the eggs. While hookworms can be ingested, the usual method of infection is through the skin; this is commonly caused by walking barefoot through areas contaminat­ed with fecal matter."
And BTW- you've got a much better chance of getting some kind of parasite from eating sushi than you do from eating insects, because the insects are thoroughly cooked, which destroys any micro-orga­nisms they might have.

				Hey! I need some money. Will some bug restaurant pay me to eat their bug concoction­s? I'd love to try meal worms and katydids. Canadian bait worms are great sauteed after you purge 'em in water for a few days. Amazon sells dried mealworms and katydids I can't afford yet. Wild bugs around the garden you don't know what's in their food. I have one last Canadian bait worm in water just waiting to be fried in oil.

				I bet this article changes of disappears when someone from Nathan's gets wind of it. As for insects, I've eaten crickets and ants on a desert survival course and it wasn't a bad experience at all. The formic acid of ants gives them a somewhat zesty, citrus-ish flavor...a­s well as I can describe it. I have no problem with this whatsoever­, as it's just a mental and cultural thing. The way things are going now, soon it may be a necessity.

				I am one of those if you make sure it taste good I am game to eat it. Bugs? Big deal. Just have to get over the culture thing. We do eat old moldy milk and call it cheese and we love it and it taste great. And ever see what's in salami and how it's aged? Or rotted just right. We will someday eat more strange forms of protein as population continues to spiral out of control. And if you think about it there is plenty enough bugs to always go around. They breed way way to fast to ever run out.

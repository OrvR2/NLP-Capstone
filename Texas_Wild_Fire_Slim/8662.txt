Obama jobs package won't bust debt ceiling: White HouseBy Alister Bull, Matt Spetalnick and Laura MacInnis | Reuters – 15 hrs ago






WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A package of job-creation and economic growth proposals that President Barack Obama will put before Congress will be paid for and will not breach the legal U.S. borrowing limit, the White House said on Wednesday.
"We're not going to bust the debt ceiling," White House press secretary Jay Carney told a news briefing.
The president will deliver a major jobs speech to a joint session of Congress on Thursday.
Carney declined to confirm reports Obama would lay out a $300 billion package before lawmakers, who last month backed a $2.1 trillion increase in the U.S. debt ceiling in three steps, after agreeing to seek spending cuts of at least that amount.
Obama "will put forward, both in his speech and supporting material, a very detailed set of proposals to grow the economy and create jobs," Carney said. "They will be specific, they will be measurable, they will be paid for," he said.
Job creating proposals that lead to an increase in government spending could potentially lift U.S. borrowing toward the legal limit if they are large enough and not paid for fast enough by other measures to boost revenue or curb spending elsewhere.

Nothing against Obama, but all of the racist posts are ridiculous. I'm voting for Kevin Kline in 2012. He fixed the budget in 1 day. Go KEV!!!!!!

Three things will restore the economy and create abundant jobs:
Abolish the Fed, and stop printing free money.
Abolish the EPA.
Establish a flat tax, and downsize the IRS. 
Do these three things and the real economy will instantly start booming!

A $300 billion stimulus is the best that Obama can come up with after a year of focus like a laser on fixing the economy? Incredible.

I hope Obama has his lies together.  He needs all the stupid voters in America to vote for him.

Obama couldn't drop a penny in a bathtub without screwing it up.

He already busted the budget. Where is this 300 Billion coming from? Off the back of over worked and over tax middle American workers.

'Obama to propose $300 billion to jump-start jobs'

Another 'Stimulus Package' and 'Shovel Ready Jobs'???
...Just more and more taxes AND more and more b*lls**t!

'Hope and Change' has become 'Ignorance and Arrogance'.

A Balance Budget Amendment FIRST or SHUT IT DOWN! Otherwise my friends we are toast.

Reganomics won't work without a Balanced Budget Amendment and Obamunism won't work period.

It won't create jobs either.  Lets look at some of his ideas:
Infrastructure: If more of the first stimulus had gone to infrastructure, the country would be working now. Yes, fix our deteriorating bridges, roads and dams; upgrade our ports; and harden our communications. Don't forget municipal water systems either. Some are a century old, contain lead, and leak more than they deliver. It's bad for the consumer, the economy, and the environment. Unfortunately, these things don't happen fast enough to stimulate the current economy.
Payroll tax cuts: Social Security is dying so let's hasten it's demise. It's a bad idea. Remember, seniors paid for this insurance plan, and seniors vote.
Aid for teachers: It's just another Democrat payback to the unions for their support. Business tax cuts: The only real way to promote hiring is to stimulate demand, which this doesn't do. Businesses don't hire people to stand around. Try tax reform for real long term benefits in this area.
Job training: It's a long term program, so it's not stimulative. It should be separate legislation. A 33% success rate isn't all that impressive either but it might improve with a better economy.
Unemployment benefits: There isn't much choice, is there?
Homeowner aid: Taxpayers, including renters who get no homeowner perks, shouldn't continue to subsidize the irresponsible decisions made by banks with their liar loans, ratings agencies that called junk mortgages investment grade, and buyers who knew they couldn't afford what they bought. Limit aid to those who bought homes within their means and have lost jobs through no fault of their own.
Conclusion: Demand for products and services is what creates jobs, and nothing here stimulates demand. Sorry, there's no stimulus in the stimulus.

Is this a statement like the jobs are "shovel ready" or that Biden will be accounting for all of the stimulus money.  No reason for us to doubt the WH on this one.  (eyes rolling).

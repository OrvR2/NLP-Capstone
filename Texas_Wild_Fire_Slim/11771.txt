As Congressman Paul Ryan cracked a joke about him, Tom Nielsen found himself face down on the floor being handcuffed by police. The 71-year-old retired plumber from Kenosha was thrown to the ground, placed in handcuffs, and arrested for trespassing and resisting arrest after objecting to Ryan's plans to gut Social Security and Medicare during his congressman's only public appearance scheduled during the August recess -- a $15 Rotary Club luncheon in West Allis on Tuesday. Nielsen repeatedly told police that he wasn't fighting them and that he didn't want to make any trouble.  He also told them several times that he had a broken shoulder. Police officers ignored his comments as they wrestled him to the ground despite his howls of pain. Nielsen's comment to Ryan at the luncheon, his arrest, and Ryan's joke are all captured on video available here.

Ryan: "Ha Ha aren't old people funny? I mean what's the deal with them? They work for 30 years and pay my salary but think they deserve some kinda 'socialist' entitlement for their hard work? Why weren't they﻿ just born rich and spoiled like I was? Or at the very least why don't they just exploit everyone under them and receive huge bribes from Lobbyists? What's up with that huh?"

This is what's in store for america if the tea﻿ baggers get to capture power absolute in this country. I believe is a wake up call, that questioning this gang of nazis, won't be tolerated.

Funny when it is something that benefits the middle class its called "entitlement" but when it benefits the top tier it is called "good for the economy" The old guy is right. If I work for DECADES putting my own money into something, don't you think﻿ I should have access to it once I am retired?

@launcheverything I would have liked to the 71 year and floppy ears get into a fight. My bet would﻿ be on the 71 year old coming out the winner.

these old﻿ republicans are letting their bigotry be manipulated by these assholes and they just don't know that they'll sell you out without hesitation.

The real﻿ joke - besides your floppy ears - is that the old man paid into the system which you hate - and you will get the best retirement as an elected official. My bet is that the 71 year old would kick your butt in a street fight because you sir are a coward.

Robinson ISD seeks $39 million bond for new school

Robinson school district is asking voters to approve a new junior high and several other renovations for the district through a $39 million bond issue.The Robinson Independent School District board of trustees voted unanimously this week to call a bond election to be held Nov. 8. The $39 million bond package will increase the tax rate by  35 cents. The new tax rate would be about $1.67 per $100 valuation. A resident with a $100,000 home would see a tax increase of about $25.15 a month.Robinson ISD held an election in 2009 that raised its tax rate by  13 cents.The $39 million would build a new junior high school with a capacity of 800 students. There now are 550 students in sixth through eighth grades.The existing junior high, built in 1969, lacks electrical capacity to support current technology needs, Robinson Superintendent Michael Hope said in a statement. The building also has classrooms that don’t meet the standards set by the Americans With Disabilities Act and don’t meet current state standards for size.The bond package also includes improvements throughout the district, including additions at Robinson elementary and primary schools. The additions will allow the district to eliminate Robinson Intermediate School altogether, moving the fourth and fifth grades into the elementary school. Hope said adding the two grades to the elementary school will help align curriculum at that level.The current intermediate school, built in 1963, has problems similar to those at the junior high and shows signs of foundation movement. A facilities study done in 2006 rate both the junior high and intermediate schools as “borderline.”Hope said the bond issue, which reduces the number of student-use buildings from 16 to six, will improve security and reduce maintenance costs.Additional projects funded by the bond would be a locker room and weight room addition to the high school; upgrades to the agricultural science department; technology and security upgrades; and relocating maintenance, transportation and administrative offices.Robinson ISD formed a facilities committee of about  20 community members to work on the bond.Steve Ostrom, chairman of the facilities committee, said he knows money is tight, but hopes the community can get behind the bond issue.“There’s not ever a good time to spend money,” Ostrom said. “We’ve just got to convince the citizens of Robinson and the school district that this is a need that can’t be overlooked.”Ostrom said the facilities committee will meet next week to set a schedule of town hall-type meetings to inform voters about the bond issue.“This proposal meets our current needs and creates space for future growth in the most efficient way possible. With interest rates and construction prices at historic lows, it seems like the best time for our community to consider making this investment,” Ostrom said in a statement. The district’s last bond election was in 1999.wgragg@wacotrib.com757-6901

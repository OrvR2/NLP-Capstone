Latest artificial heart has no pulse… hold on a second.

(Via Instapundit) We have artificial hearts now?
That WORK?
(pause)
Is there a news feed that everybody else subscribes to, and I don’t?

Death blimp.

My wife reminded me of this:
I always knew this was going to happen. I always knew that skepticism and science were mere psychological decorations and vanities. Deep in our alligator brains we all know that the world is just chock full of evil and monsters and sinister forces aligned against us, and it is only a matter of time until they show up. Evolution know this, too. It knows what to do when the silent terror comes at you from out of the dark.
…and it’s six years old, which makes it retro by the Internet’s standards.  Enjoy.
Moe Lane
PS: You know that you want this..

Movie of the Week: The Wizard of Oz.

It was going to be Taken, but I did that one already.  So it being Wednesday: farewell to Village of the Damned, and hello to the 70 year old The Wizard of Oz.

Quit while you’re behind, Anne Applebaum.

Far, far, far behind.  Patterico has you dead to rights, and pounding the table and shouting won’t do you a darn bit of good.
I don’t want to really get into the Roman Polanski matter further – I’ve been catching myself indulging in a certain bloodthirsty attitude regarding the child-rapist that I probably shouldn’t be indulging into – so here’s a video of a puppy fighting a robot.

Relax.  The puppy wins.

Palin’s upcoming book already #3 on Amazon?

Going Rogue: An American Life doesn’t even have an Amazon picture yet, and it’s already selling like hotcakes.  Is that normal?

Also, I like Glenn Reynold’s alternate suggestion better, too.  Maybe as a subtitle…

Abraham Lincoln… didn’t survive the Civil War, Gore Vidal.

He was assassinated just after Lee’s surrender, which is not quite the same thing.  And if there’s a reference besides you for this quote:
“I am President of the United States. I have full overall power and never forget it, because I will exercise it.”
…I have yet to find it.  Source?
Moe Lane
PS: Like Hot Air, I agree: stop smoking crack on the upcoming military dictatorship thing, Gore Vidal.  You too, John Perry.
PPS: Seriously, I can’t find it at all.

R.S. McCain in Kentucky already finding media bias in Sparkman killing.

Oh, you’re going to just love this one.  Robert Stacy McCain went down to the site of the Sparkman murder in Kentucky to do some on-the-scene reporting, and he’s already found a situation where an Obama supporter and Democrat who was skeptical of the media treatment of this story got turned into a stereotypical government-hater by a reporter.
Oops.
He’s got video of that interview, so click on over to check it out.

Cheesy YouTube Video Watch: Anything For Love, Literal Video Version

As I mentioned last night on Twitter, the embarrassing thing is that I like the original song just fine.  
Because I’m a philistine, that’s why.

Last day of the fiscal quarter, folks.

Just to add to Kevin Jennings’ bad day.

So, by Jennings’ formula Mary Cheney is a conscientious objector and he’s collaborating with the occupying government.  Wait, what?
I was emailed a link to this 2007 article by getting-to-be-beleaguered ‘safe schools czar’ Kevin Jennings:
This isn’t a fight where neutrality is an option, Mary. As Nobel Prize winner  Elie Wiesel has said, “Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence  encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.” Whether you like it or not,  politics does play a role here. So get with the  program.
I wish Mary’s fantasy, that we could ignore  politics, were true. But her baby will find out that  her Mom is just deluded soon enough. Children of the “Greatest Generation”  routinely asked their Dads “What did you do during the war?” As Antonin Scalia  and Pat Buchanan are so fond of pointing out, we’re in a cultural war right now  over whether or not LGBT people are entitled to the same level of dignity and  respect as other Americans. Some day little Cheney is going to ask, “What did  you do during the war, Mom?” Mary (to date) has sat on the sidelines – helping  the oppressor. Too bad some day little Cheney will realize her Mom could have  been part of the solution, but instead obstinately stuck her head in the sand  over and over and thus was just part of the problem. I hope little Cheney can  some day forgive her.
Smug fellow, isn’t he?  Since then, of course, Mary Cheney’s father former Vice President Dick Cheney has forthrightly and openly repeated* his support for same-sex marriage; while Kevin Jennings went on to serve a man who’s too much of a coward to follow suit.  The term ‘irony’ is often misused in this culture, but I believe that we have a legitimate opportunity here to use it.’
Also ‘hypocrisy,’ but that’s common with the Democrats on this issue.  Right down the line.

This is the greatest alarm clock in the history of humanity.

I must possess one.
If your entire nervous system is governed by your awareness of cooking food, or put another way, if you are male, you will love this clock perhaps even more than life itself. The Wake’n’Bacon is fitted with two halogen lamps that turn on ten minutes before it’s time to wake – cooking a slice of bacon you have put on the recessed grill-tray. Who could sleep through the smell of cooking bacon? Who would want to?
The email that sent this to me H/T’ed somebody called Jeff Quinton.  Jeff, whoever you are: I hope somebody buys you one.

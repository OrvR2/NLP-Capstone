Wow, there are some really hateful people in this world. ﻿ Judgement day is coming, might want to start reading a Bible. All of this (droughts, floods, earthquakes, volcanic erruptions, disease, starvation, etc..) is in it.

I can't stand Rick Perry. However, this is a natural disaster. When the wind is blowing 30 miles and hour, and a fire starts in a drought-stricken area full of pine trees, there is hardly a way of stopping it. Democrats didn't start the fire, republicans didn't start the fire. Even﻿ if the Bastrop Co. firefighters had all the money in the world, it would not have stopped this from happening. Please.

@grantwp3
No, Karma would be if the fire burned down everything belonging to Governor Goodhair, and﻿ nothing else. ;)

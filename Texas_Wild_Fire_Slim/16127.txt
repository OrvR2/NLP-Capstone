			ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

Submission must be primarily in English.
The person uploading the Submission will be deemed the entrant ("Entrant"). The
				Entrant is the one (1) person who owns the email address associated with the Improv.com
				profile. If any group elects to collaborate on a Submission, they are required to
				designate one (1) person as the agent of the group to enter the Contest, agree to
				these rules and accept the prize on behalf of the group. Neither Company nor any
				of the Contest Parties are liable for any disputes between collaborators arising
				under or related to the Contest.
Each Submission must comply with the Web Site's Terms of Service, as well as these
				Official Rules. In the event of any inconsistency between these Official Rules and
				the Terms of Service, the terms in these Official Rules shall prevail.
Each Submission must be the original work of the Entrant produced for this Contest;
				it may not have been entered in or won previous contests or awards; it may not have
				been published previously in any medium; it must not infringe any party's intellectual
				property or other rights; it must not contain obscene or pornographic material,
				it must not contain defamatory statements (including but not limited to words or
				symbols that are widely considered offensive to individuals of a certain race, ethnicity,
				religion, sexual orientation or socioeconomic group), it must not include threats
				to any person, place, business, group or world peace, it must not invade privacy
				or other rights of any person, firm or entity, and it must not in any other way
				violate applicable laws and regulations or network standards.
Each Submission must not feature or refer to any comedy club other than IMPROV™
				Clubs; it must not feature or reference any IMPROV™ Marks or any other third party
				trademarks (with the exclusion of any IMPROV™ brand assets specifically provided
				on the Web Site for this Content), and it must not feature or reference any names
				or third party logos (other than the IMPROV™ logo).
Each Submission must not utilize live animals unless the Entrant has obtained the
				consent of the animal's owner and an affidavit from the animal owner or wrangler
				that the animal was not harmed in the making of the Submission. Entrants are encouraged
				to contact the local Humane Society prior to filming the Submission to verify appropriate
				animal safeguards during filming.
Each Submission must not contain any copyrighted works (other than as owned by the
				Entrant). You may not include any music except for the pre-approved music provided
				on the Web Site. Approved music provided on the Web may not be altered. Use of any
				unauthorized music may result in disqualification of Submission, in Company's sole
				discretion.
Company reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove or blur or to ask the
				applicable Entrant to remove or blur any non-material elements (e.g. small logos
				on clothing, artwork hanging in the background, etc.) rather than disqualify an
				otherwise compliant Submission.


			All Submissions will be reviewed for content before being published or judged; however,
			such review does not relieve Entrant from responsibility for compliance with all
			of the Terms of Service and these Official Rules. Submissions that do not comply
			in all material respects with the Terms of Services or these Official Rules or that
			otherwise contain prohibited, or inappropriate content as determined by the Company,
			in its sole discretion, will be disqualified and will not be considered for prizes.
			Company makes the final determination as to which Submissions are eligible to take
			part in this Contest and be considered for a prize. Certain Submissions may be featured
			from time to time on the Web Site during the Contest Period, in Company's sole discretion;
			being selected as a featured Submission is unrelated to the Judging Criteria and
			does not guarantee selection as a winner in the Contest.

			BY ENTERING THIS CONTEST AND UPLOADING YOUR SUBMISSION, YOU IRREVOCABLY GRANT TO
			COMPANY AND ITS AGENTS THE UNCONDITIONAL AND PERPETUAL RIGHT TO POST, DISPLAY, PUBLISH,
			USE, ADAPT, EDIT AND/OR MODIFY SUCH SUBMISSION IN ANY WAY, ON IMPROV.COM AND AFFILIATED
			WEBSITES, FOR ANY PURPOSE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, AND WITHOUT CONSIDERATION TO YOU.
			ALL CONTEST ENTRANTS FURTHER AGREE TO RELEASE AND INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE
			COMPANY AND THE CONTEST PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS THAT ANY ADVERTISING, PRESENTATION,
			WEB CONTENT OR ANY OTHER MATERIAL SUBSEQUENTLY PRODUCED, PRESENTED, AND/OR PREPARED
			BY OR ON BEHALF OF COMPANY INFRINGES ON THE RIGHTS OF ENTRANT'S WORK AS CONTAINED
			IN ANY SUBMISSION.

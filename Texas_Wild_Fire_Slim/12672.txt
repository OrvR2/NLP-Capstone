This could put Mahmoud Abbas at odds with Washington. Earlier, the United States has expressed its objection to a Palestinian statehood, saying it will veto any UN resolution recognizing Palestinian statehood.Mahmoud Abbas Wants To Avoid ConfrontationThe Palestinian Authority leader hopes to avoid confrontation with U.S. officials over the statehood bid. He told reporters that he does not want to create tension with the U.S. official, who have talked about some sort of confrontation with Palestine if it pushes through with statehood. Mahmoud Abbas made an appeal to let Palestinians express their ideas and hope. The Palestinians, Mahmoud said, are a people without hope now.Palestinian State Under OccupationEven if last ditch efforts produced a formula to resume peace talks with the Israelis are found and if it meets the Palestinians’ demands, Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinians would still go to the United Nations to push their bid for a Palestinian state. They would return to resume talks with the State of Israel. If Palestine wins U.N. recognition, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Palestine will be a state under occupation. They will talk and negotiate with the Israelis with U.N. support.Freeze on Israeli Building SettlementFor the peace talks with Israel to resume, Mahmoud Abbas said Israelis should suspend construction in West Bank and in East Jerusalem. He also added that the basis of the negotiations would be Israel’s 1967 boundaries. The Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejects a freeze on building settlement. He demands Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state, which Palestinians refuse to do so. Talks between the two parties were re-launched a year ago, but it quickly broke down in a dispute about the Israeli building settlement in Palestinian-held territories.In this article you learned that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will push for a Palestinian statehood bid at the United Nations next month.

The United States will veto any U.N. resolution recognizing a Palestinian state.Other Related Articles:Part of West Bank Barrier Removed by Israeli ...

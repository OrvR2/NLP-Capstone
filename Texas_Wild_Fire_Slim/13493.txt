Bastrop County Fire Complex
FACT SHEET
Acres: 34,068 Total
Start date of fire: September 4, 2011
Cause: Under investigation
Location: 6 miles northeast of Bastrop, Texas
Containment: 50% (Bastrop Fire); 90 percent (Union Chapel Fire)
Fuels: Timber/residential area
Total personnel: 1093
Resources: 16 crews, 126 engines, 8 water tenders, 26 dozers
UPDATE-Firefighters are working diligently to contain the Bastrop County Complex which consists of the Bastrop Fire (33,349 acres) and the Union Chapel Fire (719 acres), reinforcing containment lines with help from dozers and conducting suppression operations searching out and extinguishing flames from hot spots around existing homes in efforts to prevent any more homes from burning. The Union Chapel Fire is 90 percent contained as of Friday morning. Re-entry for residents to this area occurred today at 10 am. State Highway 71 was also re-opened today.
CURRENT CONDITION OF BASTROP FIRE AREA-After a fire burns through a residential area, many hazards may still exist because of the disruption of the infrastructure in place such as affected electrical, water, gas, telephone lines, crude oil wells, roads, dead trees and limbs and stump holes that may still be smoldering. Re-construction and re-charging of live electrical power lines are also taking place in order to restore power so residents may return home. Firefighters are also cutting and removing hazard trees that may fall at any time-even from light wind gusts. A night shift of firefighters is patrolling the perimeter of the fire to ensure hot spots are extinguished so that fire does not flare up. An infrared flight has been conducted for the last three nights to detect hot spots within and around the fire perimeter so firefighters can be directed to these specific areas.
County and city cooperators such as utility companies are also working to re-establish utilities for residents as quickly and efficiently as possible within this hazardous area. Some roads have been temporarily closed for public safety. The fire area and subdivisions under evacuations are being patrolled by law enforcement 24 hours a day to prevent looting.
ASSISTANCE: 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or www.DisasterAssistance.gov or dial 211 for local information and statewide public services (housing, food, clothing, health care, support groups, disaster information, etc.).
SAFETY MESSAGE-The safety of the public and firefighters is first priority. For the safety of residents, the Bastrop Fire area is being assessed by emergency personnel for hazards that need to be mitigated before local residents can safely re-enter these areas.

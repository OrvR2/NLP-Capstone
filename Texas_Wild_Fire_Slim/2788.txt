NEW YORK - A former vice president for Citigroup Inc pleaded guilty Tuesday to embezzling more than $22 million from the company and funneling the money to his personal bank account.
Gary Foster, 35, pleaded guilty to bank fraud, admitting that he took the money between 2003 and 2010. He appeared in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn before Judge Eric Vitaliano.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Yaeger said the government will request a prison sentence of between 97 months and 121 months. Foster will remain free on $800,000 bail until he is sentenced.
Foster was arrested in June, and at the time was charged with embezzling $19 million from the bank's accounts. He admitted in court Tuesday to taking more than $22 million. (Reporting by Jennifer Golson; Editing by Derek Caney)

				He's only 35. Who is his father? The real story is the nepotism angle. $22 million stolen from the bank and because he used a suit and tie rather than a gun and a get away car he gets a slap on the wrist.

Sickening, but not unexpected­.

				So he did to Citi what they and the rest of the Banksters have done to America...­. He got caught and will do time... as of course he should. BUT what's amazing is that not ONE single bankster that was involved in the financial meltdown caused by Wall St has done even a day of jail time.
Now when someone steals from THEM.... show no mercy and throw the book at him.. prosecute to the fullest measure of the law.... There is something very seriously wrong here... It's a double standard that has been allowed to be in place for far too long.... I guess I kind of wish this guy got away with it.... I know for sure that any time I hear of a regular citizen getting the best of these vultures I am elated.... and I know that's wrong.... But it's that same sort of mentality that permeated the country during the Great Depression when the banks were perceived as the enemy and the average guy the victim.... I wonder whose fault THAT is.....

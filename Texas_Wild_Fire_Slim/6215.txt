There's no question -- Americans are the coolest. That's according to a new poll, which ranked nationalities by how 'cool' they are perceived to be. 
The social networking site company Badoo.com surveyed 30,000 people over 15 countries to find out which nationalities were considered 'cool.' Americans came in as the coolest nationality in the world.
Among the findings -- Spanish are considered the coolest Europeans, while Brazilians are ranked the coolest Latin Americans. 
What were the most uncool nationalities? Read the whole Reuters article to find out. 
CORRECTION: A previous version of this post misstated that the Badoo.com survey profiled 30,000 people over five countries.

Woman Dies Hours After Injecting Beef Fat Into Face
Heated beef fat, no less

(Newser) -
                                    Add this to the list of really awful ways to go: An Illinois woman injected heated beef fat into her face Thursday, and died shortly thereafter. Janet Hardt, 63, had done it several times before, says a source, but after injecting the substance around her mouth and chin this time,...

'We thought it would never happen,' notes NPR

(Newser) -
                                    It  seemed like it had to be a joke , but it turns out it's just based on one: Ben & Jerry's is indeed making a flavor in tribute to Alec Baldwin's raunchy "Schweddy Balls" skit on SNL, reports  NPR,  which was itself skewered for its famously...

Woman Calls Ex 65K Times
...in a single year

(Newser) -
                                    Fatal Attraction, much? A 42-year-old Dutch woman apparently had a very, very hard time letting go of her former boyfriend ... or his phone number. Prosecutors claim she called him 65,000 times in the last year, and are charging her with stalking. Spaced over 365 days, that's 178 calls...

Cops: Walmart Workers Steal $45K for Sex Change
Pair also hoped for a car

(Newser) -
                                    One wanted a Supra; the other, a sex change. So two Walmart workers allegedly teamed up to steal $45,000 from the Arizona store that employed them—money that would purchase surgery for one and a car for the other, they told police. One of the employees distracted the cashiers...

(Newser) -
                                    A British man has conquered the 2,300-plus miles of the Mississippi, with only a stand-up paddleboard to keep him moving.

And fails, hilariously

                                    One for the Legendary Fail Department: A person dressed in a Gumby costume attempted to rob a San Diego 7-Eleven on Monday.

(Newser) -
                                    Marijuana users are less likely to be obese, according to a new study that would seem to fly in the face of the legendary munchies that are almost synonymous with pot. Researchers were so surprised by the results that they examined a second sample, only to come up with the...

                                    It’s tough to get a decent pizza in space—so tough that astronauts at the International Space Station once  received a delivery  from an earthbound Pizza Hut. Now, Domino’s Japanese operation is going a step further in the publicity wars: The chain swears it plans to open a...

(Newser) -
                                    Seeing this health worker could literally cost you an arm and a leg.

Scammers Sell Woman iPad Made of ... Wood
Imagine her surprise when it turned out to be a wood block

(Newser) -
                                    Ashley McDowell probably should have been suspicious when two guys approached her in a South Carolina McDonald’s parking lot and offered to sell her an iPad for $300. She almost certainly should have gotten suspicious when, after she explained she only had $180, the pair still agreed to the...

At VMAs, Gaga Had a Penis
A prosthetic one, at least

(Newser) -
                                    You already knew Lady Gaga’s dedication to her drag performance at the VMAs was so intense that she didn’t drop character,  even backstage . But apparently it was even more intense than we all presumed: so much so that she wore a prosthetic penis, which  Us  cutely refers to...

Yes, that's a pair of garden shears in his skull

(Newser) -
                                    Take a gander at that X-ray. What you’re looking at is the skull of a man who’d just accidentally impaled himself with the dull end of a pair of gardening shears—and lived to tell the tale. Leroy Luetscher, 86, dropped his pruner point-down while doing yard work,...

Man Charged With Stealing Ribs in His Pants ... Again
Apparently when Donald Noone gets drunk, he wants ribs

(Newser) -
                                    It’s weird enough that Donald Noone, 65, was arrested for attempting to smuggle a rack of ribs out of a grocery store in his pants yesterday. What’s weirder is that the central Pennsylvania man had already been arrested for attempting the same stunt in May, the  Sentinel  reports....

Bend over backwards to avoid offending Afghans

(Newser) -
                                    US military leaders, sensitive to winning hearts and minds in Afghanistan, have instituted several unloved regulations on troops there—no swearing, no talking about volatile subjects like politics or girls. But now leaders apparently want to win ears and noses, too, as they have introduced an unusual no-no—no farting,...

Humanity's rapid expansion could scare extra-terrestrials

(Newser) -
                                    If there is extraterrestrial life out there, and it's watching us, it might just as soon blow us to kingdom come as look at us,  LiveScience  reports—and all because of global warming. If ETs notice our greenhouse gas emissions and conclude we're expanding too rapidly, they may...

New Craze for New Moms: Eat the Placenta
Cooked or in smoothies, it has high iron levels and vitamin B-12

(Newser) -
                                    More mothers are turning to a healthy diet after giving birth, including fruit, veggies ... and a nice plate of placenta. As in, their own.

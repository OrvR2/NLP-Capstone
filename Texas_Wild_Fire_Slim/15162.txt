Answers Amid the Ashes





Red Cross disaster worker Felicia Adams comforts shelter resident Shannon Shine after she learns her house has been destroyed in the wildfires. (Photo by Dennis Drenner/American Red Cross)"I don't know what to do," sobbed Shannon Shine, a resident of Bastrop, Texas whose house was destroyed by the recent wildfires. Last week alone, wildfires burned more than 170,000 acres.Unfortunately her grief is not unique. Thousands of people were forced to flee from their homes, and many now find they will never be able to return. They don't know what to do, but with the help of the American Red Cross, they have a place to start.Overwhelmed after learning her house had been engulfed by flames, Shine met with veteran Red Cross disaster worker, Felicia Adams.Adams is no stranger to destruction, having worked in a shelter following Hurricane Katrina. Adams offered a shoulder to cry on and an answer to each question. More than 200 disaster workers like Adams are working in Texas, using not only their expertise in disaster relief and recovery, but their compassion to bring comfort to residents who have lost everything.Not Done YetConditions could not be worse for firefighters desperately trying to quell the flames and save communities. Texas is currently experiencing its worst drought since 1895 and this summer has been the second warmest on record, helping sustain the fires that first responders have battled since December. Strong winds from Tropical Storm Lee literally fanned the flames, helping the fire to spread. Today, there are 180 different wildfires burning in Texas.One of the worst affected areas is Bastrop County, where more than 34,000 acres have burned and the fire is only 60 percent contained. Of growing concern are Cass and Marion counties in northern Texas along the Arkansas and Louisiana border, where thousands of homes are threatened.In response to the growing wildfires, the Red Cross has opened seven shelters, hosting more than 800 overnight stays. We've provided more than 2,000 health and mental health consultations. Many people have reported breathing problems from inhaling smoke in the air, and the Red Cross is providing care for them.American Red Cross workers assist at a community run shelter at Bastrop  Middle School after wildfires sweep the region, driving thousands of  people from endangered neighborhoods and burning hundreds of houses to  the ground.

Many  Bastrop residents, both young and old, were having respiratory problems  due to the large amount of smoke in the air from the wildfires. (Photo by Dennis Drenner/American Red Cross)We're distributed nearly 1,000 comfort kits providing hygiene items such as toothbrushes, soap and shampoo, and 17,000 additional relief items like cleaning supplies. As residents are allowed back into their neighborhoods, Red Cross disaster workers are assisting residents, providing emotional support as well as water and snacks as they survey the damage.Support for Military FamiliesThe Red Cross is providing special assistance to military families affected by the wildfires near Fort Hood. Many families are struggling through this disaster without the support of spouses, parents and other important family members who are currently deployed. Beyond comfort and care the Red Cross is also helping verify damages and sending emergency notifications to deployed service members on behalf of family members.Our verification services help military authorities make critical decisions about granting leave to service members so they can return home to support their families. The local chapters in Waco and Austin are helping identify needs and facilitate the communications between service members and their loved ones at home. Trained caseworkers follow up with military families to make sure they are aware of additional programs and services outside of traditional disaster referrals. Such partnerships exist with the National Guard Foundation, Military OneSource and other organizations like those that provide military-specific mental health support.This is also a part of the Red Cross mission year-round. From the earliest days of Red Cross work on the battlefields of the Civil War, our organization continues to provide assistance to our military members today. We have Service to the Armed Forces staff and volunteers on 58 U.S. military installations and deployment sites including Afghanistan and Kuwait. Each year, the Red Cross delivers more than 600,000 emergency communications. The Red Cross also assists military families as well as wounded service members both at home and abroad by offering services such as hospital visits, courses on coping with deployment and financial assistance. The Red Cross briefs service members when they enter the military, at pre-deployment events and almost every week at military bases across the country to ensure military members and their families are aware of available resources.The Red Cross will continue to help all those affected in Texas. As firefighters continue to battle the blaze, we will expand our response to assist new communities, while continuing to meet the recovery needs of those in existing operations. With the generosity of American donors, we can answer the call for help whenever we are needed.American Red Cross workers visit the Tahitian Village neighborhood of Bastrop soon after homeowners are allowed to return.

American Red Cross Worker Remembers 9/11





Rescue workers amid the rubble of the World Trade Center collapse turn to the American Red Cross for a drink of cold water. Photo: Daniel Cima/American Red CrossThis story was written by Anita Foster just a few short weeks after she returned from Ground Zero. Anita seldom shares her Ground Zero experience so we're glad to have this glimpse. Today, Anita continues to work for the American Red Cross as the Chief Communications Officer for the North Texas Region.“On that day, 6,000 people did not die. On that day, 1 person died 6,000 times. We must understand this and all catastrophes in such a way, for big numbers only numb us to the true measure of mass murder,” said Rabbi Marc Gellman from the pulpit at the Yankee Stadium prayer service following the worst terrorist attack on American soil.I’m Anita Foster. I don’t expect you to know me. I am just one of 45,000 Red Cross disaster relief workers who had the privilege of serving my organization and humanity for nearly a month in New York City following the terrorist attacks on September 11. Since I returned from New York, seeing sights I could not even imagine, I have been asked to share my experiences at community groups, on television, at corporations and with friends and family. Honestly, it has been a struggle. The emotions and the right words seemed to escape me. I would sit down at my keyboard night after night trying to paint pictures with words that would describe the scenes of utter terror. But the words failed me each time. There was so much destruction, so much pain, and so many stories.As a writer for the Red Cross, I usually tell stories from the third person. I try to give you the big-picture perspective on how a particular disaster has impacted lives and how your help has made a difference. As I tried to apply that principle to this act of terrorism, I found it impossible. There is no big-picture. There is only one picture at a time. And they are lined up on a wall with the word “MISSING” above each one.The stories I am going to share with you are personal, and some are difficult to hear. They don’t represent what every Red Cross worker experienced while on assignment in New York, Washington DC, Pennsylvania or any other affected city. We were all, and will continue to be, affected in a variety of personal ways. The best I can hope for here is to share with you my journey and try to bring understanding as to the enormous amount of pain this act of terror has created, and how it has changed so many lives. There is pain for the families and friends of those lost, for those who lost their jobs and their sense of security. There is pain for the emergency workers at Ground Zero, for all relief workers and indeed, our entire nation. I suffered personal pains that I will share with you as well. As emergency workers, we are trained to be tough in difficult times. It was not possible in New York. We were all walking wounds open to the world.September 11, 2001My alarm went off at 6:30am signaling the beginning of another workday. The television was on in the background as I got ready for work and reviewed my calendar. I was about to walk out the door when a breaking news story was announced. A plane has crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City. I watched for a while and like many of you, I thought it was a terrible accident. The pilot must have had engine trouble or a heart attack. I stayed glued to the television for a few minutes, looked at my watch and decided to go ahead and go to work so as not to be late. I turned on the radio in the car and a reporter from New York was screaming, “The other tower is on fire! Huge orange flames are shooting into the sky and debris is falling from the building!” I could not believe what I was hearing. And I have to tell you honestly; an act of terrorism had not even crossed my mind. It wasn’t until the reporter said that America was being attacked that it even began to dawn on me what that meant. I drove down the highway in shock. I called a girlfriend of mine, who is originally from New York, and told her to turn the television on. Then the buildings fell. A plane crashed into the Pentagon. Another plummeted into a field in Pennsylvania. All planes were ordered grounded. News stations were reporting that hijackers had overtaken the planes and purposely caused these violent acts. I was actually shocked to hear that passengers were on those planes. I know that sounds crazy, but it never occurred to me that someone would crash planes into buildings with innocent passengers aboard. I kept thinking ‘who could do such a thing, and why? What has gone wrong in the world?’At the Red Cross, we slept very little that night. Into the early morning hours and throughout the next day, we were establishing toll-free numbers for family members who were missing their loved ones in the affected cities. We were taking thousands of phone calls at the local chapter from all of you who wanted to help and we were holding blood drives.Personally, this day, September 11, shattered all previous notions I had about our country and myself. Suddenly, we were no longer safe. In the blink of an eye, my world changed dramatically. I was working hard like every other Red Crosser, but I was just going through the motions.The Call to ActionOn September 13, the Red Cross was out at the Ballpark in Arlington raising funds for the relief operation in partnership with WBAP, KSCS and ESPN radio, as well as NBC5 and Tom Thumb. I arrived at the Ballpark at 5:00am not knowing what to expect. As the day wore on, I was overwhelmed by the generosity of people right here in our own community. Cars were wrapped around the Ballpark as people waited patiently to make their contributions and receive their red, white and blue antennae ribbons. Some just came by to talk. Others showed up to volunteer. It was truly amazing. It was also the first time I felt hopeful since the early morning hours of September 11. Around 4:00 that afternoon, my pager went off. It was our national disaster coordinator. I knew that could only mean one thing. My heart pounded and my hand shook as I dialed her number. “Anita, you are needed in New York. Make your travel plans and get on a plane as soon as possible.” Get on a plane. Travel to New York. Respond to a terrorist attack. Suddenly, I didn’t know if I was up to the challenge. I got in my car and drove to the chapter to get my instructions for travel. I cried the entire way from Arlington to Fort Worth. I was fearful of many things. The thought of boarding an aircraft so soon after such an unspeakable act of terror was overwhelming. Knowing that I was traveling to an area that thousands of people were fleeing was frightening. Thinking of all those families I had seen on the news holding up the posters of their missing both inspired me and terrified me. I knew I would not return the same person that I was before I left. After a number of cancelled flights on Friday, I finally got one on Saturday. My flight left at 4:00pm from DFW to Philadelphia. From there, I took an Amtrak train into New York where I caught a taxicab to my hotel, which would be “home” for the next three weeks. I arrived in my hotel room at 1:00 in the morning.Ground ZeroIt was dark outside when I reported for my first shift inside of Ground Zero. We went through three security checks before we could even get near the site. From a distance, I could see those sharp, jagged pentacles protruding toward the sky. I knew it was World Trade One. I walked with my team through the streets of lower Manhattan. We donned our respirator masks and packed extra Visine. With each step closer to the site, a tear came closer to escaping. Once the first one fell, it was impossible to stop the rest. A firefighter friend told me before I left that I would have to operate in third person in order to get through this ordeal. I would have to detach myself from the reality. He was right. But in those first moments, it felt like being in an altered state. I could not breathe. I could not stand. I was overcome with raw human emotion which I can’t compare to anything else I’ve ever experienced in life. My instinct was to just wail as loudly as possible—to shout toward the heavens with unanswerable questions like, “WHY? And HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN.” But I couldn’t make a sound so I just prayed silently in front of the site. There were no sounds at Ground Zero other than the machinery. No idle chatter. No words of inspiration. All around us, hundreds of workers were doing everything possible to find people alive. I couldn’t understand how they could emotionally handle looking at those buildings and know what was inside. I would look at the site, and then look away. It was too much to bear. Couldn’t they feel the spirits of the dead all around as I could? I knew in those first moments at Ground Zero that no one would be found alive. The ground I was standing on had become sacred. And then I remembered. They were working in third person. I would have to do the same. I began my shift and worked through the night.The appearance of Ground Zero would change every day. Nightly news reports would detail how many tons of wreckage was removed on a particular day. The hope of finding survivors had faded by the end of the second week. Not only were there not any survivors expected, the fear was becoming that the bodies of the missing would not be recovered. Only a small number had been found, and only a few of those were in tact. When a body, or a body part, was recovered, the work at the scene would come to a halt. Everyone would stand silently or pray as firefighters draped the temporary casket in the American flag and prepared the remains for delivery to the morgue. In these rare instances, we all knew that a family would have a small sense of peace.Family Assistance CenterMost of my time in New York was spent in between Ground Zero and the Family Assistance Center. I truly believed that Ground Zero would be the most horrifying site in New York City. But I was wrong. It was the Family Assistance Center. This is where the faces of the disaster would gather each day. In the first week, there was a pattern to the behavior of the group. Thousands would arrive each morning at 8:00am. They would check in through security, review the list of the injured who had been taken to area hospitals, and when their loved one didn’t show up there, they would check the coroners list. No new information. So they would make their way around the building. They would speak to city officials about the work at the site. They would beg for speed in removing the debris, certain their loved ones were waiting to be rescued. They would come by the Red Cross and pick up aspirin and teddy bears. Occasionally, they would visit the Red Cross Family Dining Area and try to eat. Hundreds of families sat silently, while others kneeled down in prayer asking for a miracle. Only a small number of families could be found at the Victim’s Crime Board, the place to officially list your loved one as missing. A smaller number visited the area where DNA samples were being collected. In that first week, the families were not ready to accept that their precious loved ones were not coming home. It was a sobering sight. So much suffering had never surrounded me. I truly felt trapped in between the best and the worst of humanity at exactly the same moment. It was like being on a tightrope. If you fell to the left, you were thrust into evil. If you fell to the right, you would land in the arms of a caring humanitarian. It was a balancing act for every family and every worker. There was so much suffering in the Assistance Center, and so much caring at the same time.As the weeks went by, the process shifted. There were no longer lines to read the list of injured at area hospitals. The lines were long to give DNA samples and to register loved ones as missing at the Crime Victim’s Board. On many occasions, I would hear someone across the room just scream in agony. I knew that the body of their loved one had been identified.The day the death certificates were issued was one of the hardest. Thousands of people were in the building that day. The faces looked the same—stoic. They were just going through the motions.The VisitorsCelebrities came from everywhere to visit the families at the Assistance Center or shake hands with rescue workers at Ground Zero. Everyone felt compelled to reach out in whatever way they could to lend a comforting ear. Here are just a few of the rich and famous who visited the Family Assistance Center:Bill, Hilary and Chelsea ClintonThe cast of The SopranosBette MidlerMohamad AliDon KingJoan OsbornKim FieldsKevin CostnerJohn TravoltaLance ArmstrongPaul O’Neil, New York YankeesNew York Jets Football teamCandice BergenOprah WinfreyThere were hundreds more; these are just the ones I can remember. Some broke down and cried with the families, while others found themselves speechless. They were no different from the rest of us.The WallOutside the entrance to the Family Assistance Center was the wall of photos. The smiling faces of the missing halted me in my steps day after day. There were so many. Some showed a parent with a child on their lap. Some young girls were in their party dresses, while others were in graduation caps. Many wore the uniforms of the New York Fire and Police Departments. Missing brothers and sisters were pictured together, as well as husbands and wives. Row after row of never-ending photos. I worked at this center every day while I was in New York, which meant I had to pass by the wall numerous times. It was impossible not to stop and look. Each and every time, I had to stop and look. After a while, I knew the names of the people on the posters without even looking. I could tell you what company they worked for and what floor they were last known to be on. The wall was ever evolving. Flowers and candles would change daily and loved ones would write messages on the posters for the world to read. I broke down and cried in front of the wall many times. Everyone did.Inside the center was the same wall of photos, however, this is where the families wrote their most heartfelt thoughts. It took days to read all the messages from loved ones. And the messages changed over time. You knew when reality was beginning to set in, evidenced by the "You are at peace" messages next to the photos. Lining the wall were thousands of Teddy Bears that were sent from Oklahoma City. Each had a special message or a drawing from a child attached. The words and colorful drawings of our nation's youth could be seen throughout the center. Every square inch was covered with a picture, banner or card from someone in the world sending their heartfelt condolences.The People I’ve already mentioned a number of celebrities who visited with the families. But these weren’t the people that will live in, or haunt, my memories. It’s the ones that you’ve never heard of that impacted me the most. Those that poured their hearts out and shared their pain so openly. Here are just a few of hundreds that I could share:BlancheI met Blanche eight days after the attacks when she walked in the door at the Family Assistance Center. She just looked dazed and confused and I knew immediately that she had lost someone she loved. I talked with her for a bit and she inquired as to where the Crime Victim’s Board was located. Through our conversation, I learned that her 32-year-old son, Eric, had not been heard from since September 11. She spoke with him after Tower One was hit. He was in Tower Two. He told her everything was fine and they were evacuating the building. She said "Okay honey, be careful. I love you." She showed me pictures of her son and told me about him and how he was a caring person. Tears were welling up in my eyes as I walked her to the Crime Victim’s Board so that she could begin the process of reporting Eric as “missing”. It was eight days after the attacks and she was just beginning to believe that he might not come home. I hugged her and she thanked me for listening to her stories. I walked outside to try to compose myself. I found myself in front of the wall of the missing when I saw Eric's photo. His mom wrote a note on his poster that said, "Come home soon honey. We miss you. Love, Mom.” I cried a lot on this day.Missing HusbandTwelve days after the attacks, I met a woman who was still waiting for her husband to come home. She had visited the center every day since it opened. September 11 was her husband's birthday. She remains hopeful and believes that his birthday gift will be his safe return to their family.Cantor FitzgeraldAnother woman I met had a friend who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald, but was not listed on the "safe list" or the missing list. The “safe” list meant that an employee had been accounted for. We all knew what the missing list meant. The Cantor Fitzgerald space in the Family Assistance Center was beyond words. The people working with the families of this company were all volunteers—the sad reality being that so few of their employees survived. I sat with this woman for almost an hour as the volunteers with Cantor Fitzgerald methodically checked databases and pulled files. Unfortunately, there was no news. Throughout this meeting, my job was to hand Kleenex to this sobbing person in utter pain. She left the center to go sit on the stoop of his apartment building and wait to see if he came home.JohnI met a gentleman, John, working for the Red Cross at the Family Assistance Center. His son attended the daycare just two blocks from the World Trade Center, and his wife worked in Tower One. She was dropping their four year old off at the daycare just as the first plane hit the building. John did not know if his wife was in the building, or if his son was safe. The daycare was shut down and the 35 children and handful of adults was ordered to stay put. John was frantically calling his wife on the cell phone as he raced toward his son's daycare center. He got no answer on the phone. When he neared the area, police and fire officials ordered him out. Everyone else was running through the streets in the opposite direction from John. He bolted around the barricades until he reached the daycare. By this time, the first tower had already fallen. He entered the daycare and found the children huddled together in a back room, terrified. He also found his wife. He ran into the street to summon help. Debris was falling all around when he heard the second tower begin to collapse. They remained huddled together and survived that collapse, but John knew they had to get out of there. A city bus bringing fresh firefighters to the scene approached. John told the bus driver they had to get the kids out of there. Together, they loaded the children onto the bus and headed for the Pier. They put the kids on tugboats and took them to New Jersey. John stayed with the kids throughout the night because their parents could not get to them. The infrastructure of the city was closed and no one could travel over bridges. John was so moved by what the Red Cross was doing that he immediately became a volunteer and continues to work every day at the Family Assistance Center. Now, that's a hero my friends.The HurtingI was reporting for duty one night at the Family Assistance Center. As always, I was slowly making my way in front of the wall, looking at the photos when this woman passed by me. I cannot describe in words the look on her face. She was walking and breathing, but she was not there. As I continued walking down the long row of photos, her face haunted me. I was wondering about her story. She was obviously traumatized. A man stopped me in front of the entrance and asked if mental health counseling was available if they didn’t directly lose a loved one. I said of course and offered to walk him into the building. He said he needed to call his wife. The same woman who had just passed by me returned. I spoke to her, but she did not answer. She could not hear or see me. This was common. The husband shared with me how she had been at their apartment on the morning of the attacks. They lived across the street from the World Trade Center. Through their windows, she watched in horror as flames shot out of the towers, and bodies fell to the ground. Many bodies. She believed that the explosions forced some out while others leapt to their deaths. Nonetheless, lives were ending literally before her eyes.There were countless faces of pain that I witnessed. I’ll never know their names. In subway stations, people sat and cried. Tears streamed down the faces of thousands of New Yorkers as they made their way about the city. In front of every fire station that we passed, people were knelt in prayer. There was no way to escape the magnitude of the tragedy, no matter how hard we tried.Ken and DianeKen and Diane arrived for Red Cross duty at the Family Assistance Center just a few short days after the attack. While talking with them, I discovered that they had traveled from Oklahoma City. Both had lost loved ones in the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building. Diane is the wife of a Secret Service agent whose body was never recovered. Ken is the son of the woman whose body was the last recovered, 40 days after the explosion. I watched them every day holding hands with the families and sharing tears. It really helped the families to talk to these two. They truly understood as none of us could.The OutpouringThrough all of this suffering, there were so many moments where I found myself having more faith in humanity that I ever had before. I would call back to my chapter and they would tell me that our community was responding with such compassion. All across America, sleeves were being rolled up to give blood, fundraising drives were being held, children were drawing pictures for the firefighters and police officers and prayer services were being attended. While I was in New York, I visited a fire station that had lost 18 firefighters. There was an impromptu memorial established in front of the station. Flowers were piled four feet high all around the building. Statues were delivered. Photos were posted. Strangers would stop by to greet the workers and share their sympathies for those they never met. Taxicab drivers would give me free rides as their way of saying thanks. Never once did I have to pay for the subway. A little girl stopped me on the street, tugged on my sleeve and said, “thank you Red Cross for helping the people.” I received email from people I’ve never met simply because they knew I was there and wanted to share their words of thanks. I could literally feel the prayers from my family, friends, coworkers and strangers. It is the only thing that sustained me day after day. It is the positive reaction of the people of the world that I tried to focus on while in New York. Focusing on the reality of the situation simply wasn’t possible. But with all things, reality does eventually set in.The Emotional Ground ZeroReturning from New York was almost as difficult as leaving. When the plane left LaGuardia, I could still see the smoke from Ground Zero in the air. Tears streamed down my face as I looked out the small window at a world I could no longer understand. I had been operating on pure adrenaline for three weeks. I had no idea what would happen once I got home. It has not been pleasant. For the first few days, I could barely move. I was extremely tired, emotionally and physically. Slowly, I started getting out of the house and trying to socialize. It wasn’t easy though. I found talking to be a challenge and talking about New York an even greater one. I returned to work at the local chapter and for the first week, could barely concentrate on anything. All the while, I’m only managing about two to three hours of sleep a night. When I was sleeping, my dreams were riddled with violence. I knew this would be normal, but they were still disturbing. The second week I was home, I went into denial. I threw myself into my job, working long hours and saying I could handle everything, no problem. By the third week I was sleeping better, but had completely shut down emotionally. I was having trouble just making small talk with the gas station attendant, much less with the people close to me. My behavior had changed and not for the better. I was short tempered with the people I really care about. This was not fair to them. The fourth week brought the loss of an important relationship in my life. The same week, I received a letter from the Disaster Operation Center at Red Cross National Headquarters. They were acknowledging the amount of time that I had served on the job and the amount of time that I’d been home. It listed possible symptoms that we might be experiencing as a result of witnessing such trauma and urged us to get in touch with our local Red Cross mental health team if we were having any emotional problems. I knew I was in trouble so I reached out to one of our Red Cross disaster mental health workers. I felt like my life was totally falling apart. The transition back to “normal life” was not going according to plan. The counselor was wonderful in helping me to understand that my feelings of despair were okay and that I had to accept them. Partly, I felt guilty for having these feelings of despair. After all, I didn’t lose a loved one personally. I didn’t lose my job. I just lost what we all did—our sense of security. For me, I had lost some of my faith in humanity. I am a believer in peace and being surrounded by so much agony caused by hatred took its toll. I will not be alone in these feelings, that’s for sure. There will be thousands of workers who will need help in dealing with this tragedy. The families who lost loved ones will need ongoing mental health care for years. But in America, these services are available for us whenever we need them. As I enter my fifth week following Ground Zero, I will continue to work with my mental health counselor. I will focus on the acts of compassion around our nation that truly touched my heart. I will look at this experience as a great teacher. I will not mourn the loss of the old me, but rather accept the new me. The one who has seen the worst of humanity and still has faith that people are inherently good. I hope we can all do that. I will not try to forget the horrifying scenes that are etched in my mind. Or the scenes of great compassion.On behalf of everyone at the American Red Cross, thank you for your contribution. However you chose to help, it made a difference. Thank you for supporting the important humanitarian work of the American Red Cross. We are stronger because of your help. We will give that strength to the affected families. Thank you for trusting us, as you always have, to wrap our hearts around those who need us most. We will continue working on your behalf in New York, Washington DC and other areas for years to come.Rabbi Marc Gellman stated at that prayer service in New York: “On that day, 6,000 people did not die. On that day, one person died 6,000 times.” I say… On that day, millions of people did not give to help our world. On that day, one person gave millions of times.” Peace to you and God Bless America.

American Red Cross Responds Across the Country to Wildfires, Floods and Tornadoes





The American Red Cross provided food and shelter for more than 1,000 people around the country Monday night from multiple disasters, including residents impacted by wildfires in Texas and Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee, which left severe weather in its wake over the Labor Day weekend.In Texas, more than 450 residents spent Monday night in 10 Red Cross shelters as wildfires burned hundreds of homes and forced residents to evacuate. The Red Cross disaster response in Texas now joins multiple other Red Cross operations underway across the U.S. in response to floods, other wildfires and tornadoes.Tornadoes spawned by remnants of Lee damaged homes and caused evacuations in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee on Monday, leading the Red Cross to open shelters in all three states. Red Cross shelters were also opened in Louisiana and Mississippi as Lee dumped torrential rain on the Gulf Coast. Heavy rains and extensive flooding are expected to continue as Lee’s remnants expand northeast into the Tennessee Valley and central Appalachian mountains through Tuesday.   The Red Cross is also continuing to help people impacted by Hurricane Irene. To date, the Red Cross has served more than 1.6 million meals and snacks and provided approximately 58,000 overnight shelter stays since the storm made landfall on August 27. The Red Cross is also distributing supplies to help residents who are cleaning up homes damaged by Irene’s wind, rain and floods. So far, the Red Cross has given out more than 516,000 relief items such as hygiene kits, mops, brooms, tarps, work gloves and coolers.“Right now our focus is making sure people forced from their homes by floods and wildfires have a safe place to stay and a good meal,” said Charley Shimanski, Red Cross senior vice president of disaster services. “The Red Cross works year-round to be prepared to help people affected by emergencies, and that’s why we’re able to respond to so many disasters at one time.”The Red Cross currently has disaster relief operations active in more than a dozen states, and current estimates for Red Cross relief for Hurricane Irene alone are from $10 million to $15 million.Those who want to help can make a donation to support American Red Cross Disaster Relief. This gift enables the Red Cross to prepare for and provide shelter, food, emotional support and other assistance in response to disasters. Visit www.redcross.org or call 1-800-RED-CROSS; you can also text the word “REDCROSS” to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Contributions may also be sent to local American Red Cross chapters or to the American Red Cross, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, DC 20013.

Red Cross Responds to Fires Across Texas





Photo: AP Photo/Austin American-Statesman, Jay JannerDestructive wildfires have taken their toll across the state of Texas. Far and wide, the fires have scorched thousands of acres and forced the evacuations of hundreds of families.In North Texas, Red Cross teams spent the day yesterday ensuring that no families had lost their homes, while also providing hydration support to area firefighters. As of this time, no families have needed Red Cross assistance in the North Texas area. Today, teams remain on standby in the event of another fire outbreak.Further south, the picture is much more grim. The American Red Cross chapter in Austin is reporting some 300 families impacted by yesterday's fast moving fire. They have opened up three shelters with an overnight population of 250 people.Red Cross teams remain in touch with families affected by the Possum Kingdom Lake fire and at fire scenes in East Texas.Right now, the Red Cross is urging those who are unaffected by recent disasters to support not just Texans, but the people on the east coast as they clear debris left by Hurricane Irene, to help the folks in Louisiana as they contend with Tropical Storm Lee and to help the next unknown disaster victim. The best way to help is to make a financial contribution at www.redcrossdallas.org or to text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to donate $10. Donations will be used where the need is greatest.

Red Cross Water Wells Replenished





The Red Cross is known world-wide for helping families with food, clothing and shelter after disasters. But we also provide unknown and lifesaving service in communities across the Metroplex every day; and that's making sure that area firefighters working on disaster scenes have plenty of bottled water and Gatorade to keep them hydrated.
 With this year's extreme temperatures, the Red Cross plowed through an entire summer's worth of bottled water and Gatorade in just a few short weeks. We saw an increase of 132% in the amount of hydration supplies distributed over this time last year, and a 46% increase in disaster responses. The Dallas Area Chapter was facing a critical water shortage, but citizens and businesses across North Texas and around the country stepped up to help us restock our shelves.
 Today, our water wells are replenished and your American Red Cross is responding to numerous wildfires across North Texas. Our disaster relief volunteers are fanned across North Texas to ensure firefighters and emergency response workers are hydrated. This would not be possible without the outpouring of financial support we received to help us restock our shelves. Thank you to everyone who made a financial gift and to our corporate partners Nestle, Quaker Oats, Pepsi and Grainger for their generous donations. Special thanks also go out to Dr Pepper Snapple Group for their in-kind donation, as well and for their continued support of the national Annual Disaster Giving Program and the North Texas Mass Care Task Force.

Hurricane Irene Expected to Unleash Her Fury along the Eastern Seaboard





With Hurricane Irene’s eye glaring at some of America’s most populated urban areas along the eastern seaboard, the American Red Cross is mobilizing people and resources in force. Today, two Red Cross teams and two Emergency Response Vehicles left from North Texas to support local chapters in various states who have been working around the clock sheltering evacuees and prepping for landfall.
 Any hurricane is serious business, but Irene has the potential to wreak havoc. With some 65 million people in her path, the American Red Cross is asking people who are not in her path, or who haven’t been affected by other recent storms, to support the relief effort by making a financial contribution to the American Red Cross. Already, the organization has expended tremendous resources just to get into position, but the hardest work still lies ahead.
 Financial contributions help the Red Cross purchase needed items in bulk, such as pallets of bottled water, thousands of meals and snacks, toothbrushes, toothpaste, shovels, rakes, and other relief supplies. Those funds also help to put gas in response vehicles and make it possible for a volunteer to make it from Texas to New York to help out after the storm.
 To make a donation to the American Red Cross, click on www.redcrossdallas.org, text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to give $10 or call 1-800-RED-CROSS. No gift is too small or too large.

Facebook DC Live: The Red Cross and FEMA Discuss Natural Disaster Relief





The number of Americans who turn to the Internet, social media and mobile technologies during disasters is on the rise, a new American Red Cross study shows. And while people should still rely on 9-1-1 in emergency situations, researchers found that the majority of Americans feel they should also be able to receive timely assistance from local and national response agencies when they post messages in social media.
 WHAT:  A Facebook Live event to announce the results of the second Red Cross survey of Americans' use of social media and other technologies during disasters. Officials from the Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Facebook will also discuss the implications of the study and how both individuals and responders can make use of the Internet, social media and mobile technology in emergency situations.  Media are welcome to view the Facebook Live event and submit questions on the Facebook platform.
 WHO: Trevor Riggen, Senior Director of Disaster Services, American Red Cross
	Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency
	Brooke Oberwetter, Associate Manager, Policy Communications
 WHY: These two new surveys show that the vast majority of Americans believe that response organizations should be monitoring social media during disasters and acting quickly to help those in need. Emergency response organizations like the Red Cross, FEMA and others now face both new challenges to harness the power of these technologies as well as opportunities to engage with people during times of disaster.
 WHEN: Wednesday, August 24, 2011, 3:30 p.m. CDT
 WHERE: http://on.fb.me/FBDCLive  RSVP: http://on.fb.me/okyVWQ  About the Speakers  William Fugate: Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Mr. Fugate was appointed by President  Obama and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on May 13, 2009 to serve as  the Administrator of FEMA. In his role, Mr. Fugate is in charge of 7,603  employees across the country working to support citizens in the event  of a natural disaster. Prior to coming to FEMA, Mr. Fugate served as  Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM).
 Trevor  Riggen: Director of Mass Care for the American Red Cross. Mr. Riggen  serves as the Red Cross lead for feeding, sheltering, and bulk  distribution in response to a manmade or natural disaster. A central  Illinois native, he previously worked at Habitat for Humanity  International, where he managed a nationwide congressional recruitment  program and led local Habitat affiliates in government relations and  housing advocacy development. He also has several years’ experience in  local nonprofit program management, including early childhood literacy,  after-school programming, and emergency planning for public school  districts.

So Far, 2011 A Costly Disaster Year





Damaged homes in Tuscaloosa, Alabama after a devastating tornado.  Photo: Dennis Drenner/American Red Cross  Experts estimate disasters caused more than $35 billion in losses  It’s been a costly year for disasters in the United States and the American Red Cross has been responding all over the country to help the thousands of people affected by flooding, tornadoes, drought and extreme heat, wildfires and other emergencies.
 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates the country’s economic loss attributable to disasters at more than $35 billion so far with several disasters each adding up to losses of $1 billion or more. The country is in the midst of hurricane season, which experts predict could be very active, so these numbers could grow.
 The disasters in the NOAA report include:
 flooding in the upper Midwest (Montana, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Missouri)
  flooding along the Mississippi River, especially in Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri and Louisiana
  extreme drought and heat combined with wildfires in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Kansas, Arkansas and Louisiana
  deadly tornadoes in the Midwest and southeast (Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, Iowa, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Tennessee)Nearly 14,000 Red Cross disaster workers from across the country supported 46 relief operations spread over more than half of the country this spring. They opened 287 shelters, served 3.5 million meals and snacks, distributed 1.7 million relief items, and provided 81,000 mental health and health consultations.
 Their work is not over. More than 100 people in North Dakota remain in shelters after the disastrous flooding in the Minot area. Every day chapters respond to smaller disasters such as home fires. One fire involving multiple families in Montgomery County, MD, resulted in 85 residents coming to a Red Cross shelter.
 Every year, the Red Cross spends an average of approximately $450 million preparing for and responding to nearly 70,000 disasters across the country and around the world. This includes both large disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes and smaller disasters such as house fires.
 If you would like to help, please consider making a donation today by visiting www.redcross.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) or texting the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Contributions may also be sent to your local Red Cross chapter or to the American Red Cross, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, DC 20013.

Red Cross Provides Comfort in Darkest Hours





American Red Cross volunteer Martha Crosby receives a warm hug from Jean Farmer, 85, who survived the devastating tornado that left her home in ruins. Tuscaloosa, AL. (Photo: Talia Frenkel/American Red Cross)  Recent tragic events—such as the stage collapse at the Indiana State Fair—remind us how important emotional support is after a disaster. In the days and weeks following a crisis, attention to mental health becomes important for survivors and emergency responders alike.
 The American Red Cross of Greater Indianapolis sent more than a dozen volunteers and employees to the scene of the collapse in Indianapolis to help support emergency workers searching for missing people. The local Red Cross also kept their chapter office open for friends and family searching for loved ones.
 The Red Cross Disaster Mental Health program began in 1992, prompted in part by the crash landing of United Airlines Flight 232 at the Sioux City, Iowa, airport in July 1989. The deadly accident took more than 100 lives, but 184 passengers and crew survived.  
 After the Sioux City crash, the local Red Cross chapter partnered with Jerry Jacobs and Randy Quevillon, licensed psychologists from the nearby University of South Dakota, to provide mental health support to survivors and disaster responders. 
 Jane Morgan, then Red Cross lead for Disaster Health Services in the Midwest, took away from that experience the knowledge that the Red Cross Disaster Mental Health program needed to be structured so that all disaster survivors and responders would have access to emotional support.
 Today, the Disaster Mental Health cadre stands at approximately 4,000 people, and represents the largest and most highly credentialed disaster mental health response force in the nation. These workers respond during some of the country’s most difficult times, including this spring’s devastating tornadoes and floods.
 You can find information on taking care of emotional health after a disaster on Redcross.org. If you’re interested in becoming a disaster volunteer, please contact the American Red Cross-Dallas Area Chapter.

Red Cross Connects Cousins – 76 Years Later





Elizabeth "Lily" Farkas was one of millions of people separated from her family amid the chaos and confusion of World War II. But thanks to a Red Cross search across international borders, she and a cousin connected after many decades.
 Lily, who now lives in Sarasota, was a teenager in Hungary during the war, and recalled those as "God awful" times.
 In 1945, the Russians came in to liberate Hungary from the Nazis, but when the Communists took over in 1949, liberation became domination and the Hungarian government was subordinate to Soviet control.
 Hungarian students began demonstrating against the Communist government in 1956 but the Soviets sent in tanks and troops and defeated the Hungarian freedom fighters.Thousands of people died, more than 26,000 were put on trial, about 13,000 were imprisoned and about 300 were executed. Nearly 200,000 refugees escaped into Austria or Yugoslavia and eventually started new lives in other parts of the world.
 Lily participated in the Hungarian Revolution and worked underground. She served 2 1/2 years as a political prisoner in Budapest and a prison in northeastern Hungary. Her husband, Imre, was sentenced to death but his sentence was later commuted to life in prison.
 In 1956 Imre and other prisoners broke out of an infamous political prison in Vac, Hungary, three days after the revolution started. Imre and Lily were reunited in Budapest and arrived in the United States on Christmas Eve 1956. They have since had two daughters and three grandchildren who live in Holland.
 Although Mrs. Farkas lost touch with her family in Hungary, a second cousin – Judit Bojthy Hajda – contacted the Red Cross to help locate her long lost relative after 76 years.
 Cindy Desmond, Director of Volunteers, Client Services and Training for the Southwest Florida Chapter of the American Red Cross, spoke with Lily to inform her that her second cousin wanted to connect with her. Red Cross family tracing services help reconnect families who have been separated internationally by war and natural disasters.
 "At first, Lily was hesitant," said Cindy. "Then the memories started to come back." 
 Now Lily corresponds with her second cousin, talking on the phone and sending photos to each other over the internet.
 There are American Red Cross caseworkers at local chapters around the United States helping families locate missing relatives by working with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations in nearly every country around the world.
 Once a family member is found, the Red Cross helps them reconnect. In the past year, the American Red Cross helped reconnect more than 4,200 families – bridging years of separation to renew critical links between new communities in the U.S. and their families around the world.

Red Cross Tips Help Kids Stay Safe When Home Alone





As children around the nation are returning to school, many of them will be spending time home alone after school until their parents get home from work.
 The American Red Cross has steps parents and children can take to make these after-school hours safer and less stressful.
 “The first thing parents need to decide is if their child is old enough to stay home alone,” said Dr. David Markenson, chair of the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council and pediatric expert. “If not, other options include after-school child care, programs at schools and youth clubs, or enrolling the child in youth sports programs.”
 “When a child is old enough will vary from child to child based on their individual development, comfort and maturity. Parents and guardians should consider their child’s maturity level and ask if he or she would be comfortable being left alone for an extended period of time,” Markenson added. “If so, parents and guardians should develop a home safety plan and discuss it and practice it with their children.”
 The Red Cross recommends that parents and guardians take the following steps if a child will be home alone after school.
 If the child is going to go home after school, it’s a good idea to have them call to check in when they get home. For an older child, set ground rules about whether other kids can come over when the parents are absent, whether cooking is an option, whether they can leave the home.
 Other steps that parents and guardians can include in their home safety plans:
   Post an emergency phone list where the children can see it. Include 9-1-1, the parents work and cell numbers, numbers for neighbors, and the numbers for anyone else who is close and trusted.   Identify neighbors whose home your child can go to in case of an emergency that requires your child to leave your home.   Practice an emergency plan with the child so they know what to do in case of fire, injury, or other emergencies. Write the plan down and make sure the child knows where it is.   Make sure the first aid kit is stocked and stored where your children can find it; keep it out of reach of young children.   Let children know where the flashlights are kept. Make sure that the batteries are fresh, and that the child knows how to use them.   Remove or safely store in locked areas dangerous items like guns, ammunition, knives, hand tools, power tools, razor blades, scissors, and other objects that can cause injury.   Make sure potential poisons like detergents, polishes, pesticides, car-care fluids, lighter fluid and lamp oils are stored in locked cabinets or out of the reach of children.   Make sure medicine is kept in a locked storage place or out of the reach of children.   Install safety covers on all unused electrical outlets.   Limit any cooking a young child can do. Make sure at least one approved smoke alarm is installed and operating on each level of the home.   Limit the time the child spends in front of the television or computer. Activate parental controls. Use programs that limit the sites children can visit, restrict chat sites and allow parents to monitor online activity.Safety Steps for Children  When talking to kids about being at home alone, parents should stress the following steps, and post them somewhere to remind the child about what they should, or shouldn’t, do until mom, dad or caregiver get home:
   Lock the door and make sure all the windows are closed and locked.   If the home has an electronic security system, children should learn how to turn it on and have it on when home alone.   Never open the door to strangers. Always check before opening the door to anyone, looking out through a peephole or window first. Only open the door for people that parents and guardians have given you permission to let in the house. If unsure, contact your caregiver.   Never open the door to delivery people or service representatives. Ask delivery people to leave the package at the door or tell them to come back at another time. Service representatives, such as a TV cable installer, should have an appointment when an adult is home.   Never tell someone on the telephone that the parents are not at home. Say something like “He or she is busy right now. Can I take a message?”   Do not talk about being home alone on public websites. Kids should be cautious about sharing information about their location when using chat rooms or posting on social networks.   Never leave the house without permission. If it’s okay to go outside, children should contact their parents and tell them where they are going, when they are leaving, and when they will return. If mom and dad are still at work, children should call them when they leave and when they return home.   Do not go outside to check out an unusual noise. If the noise worries the child, they should call their parents, an adult, or the police.   Don’t talk to strangers.   Do not have friends over to visit when your parents aren’t at home. Do not let anyone inside who is using drugs or alcohol, even if you know them.   If the child smells smoke or hears a fire or smoke alarm, they should get outside and ask a neighbor to call the fire department.Consider Babysitter’s Training for Youth Taking Care of Others  Many tweens and teens are responsible for watching younger siblings. The Red Cross Babysitter’s Training course provides 11 to 15 year-olds with the knowledge and skills necessary to safely and responsibly provide care for children and infants. Participants learn basic child care and first aid, develop leadership skills and learn how to develop a babysitting business. Contact the American Red Cross-Dallas Area Chapter or visit www.redcross.org/babysitting for more information.

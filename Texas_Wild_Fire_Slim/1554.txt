Did media coverage of the stock market crash help fuel it?By Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – Fri, Aug 5, 2011

Watching CNBC, but not listening. (AP)
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 500 points on Thursday, wiping out all of Wall Street's 2011 gains in the worst single-day sell-off since the 2008 financial crisis.
Cable and network news channels scrambled to cover the historic drop, with ABC, NBC and CBS breaking into their afternoon programming to air brief reports after the markets closed, and CNBC and Fox Business--which went commercial-free to cover the close--planning special primetime coverage.
Analysts attributed the plunge to investor fear about the U.S. economy stemming from the congressional debt deal, Europe's debt problems and troubling economic data--such as the Aug. 5 jobs report.
But how much of Thursday's slide can be attributed to the media--particularly cable news, which treated the market's fall-off  as breaking news throughout the afternoon, potentially fueling fear among investors?
Not much, media and financial vets say.
"These investors are way too sophisticated," Charlie Gasparino, senior correspondent for the Fox Business network, told The Cutline. "The markets are pretty smart, investors are pretty smart. They can see through the bull----."
Dan Gross, economics editor at Yahoo! Finance, agreed.
"A huge chunk of volume--and hence momentum--is now driven  by machines, computers and algorithmic trading," Gross said. "And the computers  definitely aren't watching cable news."
"Market activity driven largely by professionals, who are watching their data screens and usually have CNBC on with the sound off," Gross said. "They're not listening to what the hosts are saying."
If they were, they'd be hearing noise.
"I turned on CNBC at one point to find no fewer than [eight] faces in little squares, like a panicky Brady Bunch," Heidi N. Moore, who covers Wall street for Marketplace radio, wrote on her Tumblr. "Their theories to explain the drop--and oh boy, were they theories--were innovative. It was hard to follow, but at least two contributors were making a compelling case that German bunds and Swiss francs had conspired with the Japanese yen to create a whisper of QE3 in the U.S. I wondered how Colonel Mustard had escaped suspicion, what with his candlestick in the library."
Moore continued:
My theory: yesterday the Onion published a story with the headline "Drunk Bernanke Tells Bar Patrons How Screwed Up the American Economy Really Is." Obviously that's a "sell!sell!sell!" moment. It was hardly just CNBC. Other news outlets suggested that the problem was that investors had lost faith in policymakers to handle sovereign affairs. This was amusing. That's been going on for 3 years at least, people. The truth behind this blind-men-and-the-elephant farce is that people need to hear voices and theories to comfort themselves. And naturally, you can't have dead air or blank space when people want some insight into the markets freaking out.
Gasparino, who was live on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, did concede that there may have been a "herd mentality" that contributed to the sell-off during the last few minutes of trading. "You don't want to be the last one out," he said.
"But here's what none of those people will tell you," Moore added. "They don't know."

To say that the media tends to exaggerate and sensationalize all events as they unfold, is an understatement.  This is no exception!

The "media" has become cheap entertainment. It has an ideology, a cultural bias, a personal slant. It can't be trusted with 'just-the-facts'.. it spins to its agenda.

The media is a cause of many issues especially gas prices.....  There is no need to report that gas prices are on their way up according to analyst.  When they do prices increase immediately. just report what is important when it happens, not what some ANALyst thinks.

of course media coverage helped fuel the stock market crash, does the media care? of course not. for the media it's all about ratings and nothing else matters, the media can easily make or brake a person, or company, or whatever business....so the question is does the media have power? hell yes they do, and alot of it.

"Did media coverage of the stock market crash help fuel it?"    this is a trick question right?

They helped cause the 08 crash too...trying to make the markets look as bad as they could.  Every day in 08, there were references to the Great Depression and each day's drop was presented with speculation of how bad this drop could make things tomorrow.  And on, and on, and on.  The author of this piece should be fired for general stupidity.

The media doesn't sink the market in a situation like this.  It sinks the market by engaging in constantly apocalyptic coverage over longer periods of time, which it did here, as it does on every issue.

If you control the News you can bend it any way you want. Who is " The Money Masters - Full " google.com. The news does not cover the Poor, Homeless, to this degree. What more is how the News is Censored when Our Soldiers are returned with the American Flag Draped accross the Casket 
 When all is out of mind there is no real feel for the Pain that others Sacrifice for the Super Rich who gives little thought other than their Rich Lifestyles.

funny this article doesnt mention yahoo! as part of the problem, I remember seeing a breaking news update on the front page like we just had another earthquake in japan or something

One thing to remember folks.  The media is there to make money, NOT inform us. In most cases you'll find that they sell two things, fear and rumours.  It's an old investment saying that the market drops like a rock on rumour, and only gradually fights it's way up on fact.

Yes, it panicked the retired Americans who don't rely on just on Social Security for their retirement or the middle tier who are saving for their retirement.

I've always been convinced that media coverage of the depression/recession not only deepened it but encouraged it to continue longer than it should have.

Media coverage fuels everything, its their bread & butter. and could it be that it helps those who control the market swings. Oh me, do you suppose one international giant corporation helps another.

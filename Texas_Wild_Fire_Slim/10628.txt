TEXAS LUMBER AND PANEL PRODUCT MARKET STUDY, 1998









[ Print | 

 ]



See the Lumber Market Study report
Executive Summary 

This study was designed to offer a more complete picture of the lumber and panel products market in Texas. It was undertaken because the consumption growth outpaced the production growth of lumber and panel products in Texas, and Texas producers are rapidly losing their domestic market share to competitors from other states and foreign countries. The results of this study show some of the dynamics of the lumber and panel products marketplace that producers and distributors of Texas wood products can use to improve their position in that marketplace. Data on production, importing, exporting, and consumption of these products was collected, analyzed and synthesized.
Two surveys were conducted for the study. The first of two surveys targeted building products wholesalers and retailers. It was designed to collect information about suppliers of lumber and panel products, their market shares, the rationale behind purchasing from those suppliers and regional differences within Texas. The second survey tallied the destination of lumber and panel products produced by Texas manufacturers.


Lumber

Texas produced 1,485 million board feet (mmbf) and consumed 2,978 mmbf lumber in 1998. Texas was a net importer of lumber in the year. It exported 400 mmbf to and imported 1,893 mmbf from other states and foreign markets.
More than 70% of the lumber consumed in Texas was dimension lumber (2” thickness), followed by boards (1” thickness) at 24.2%, then timber (3” thickness or greater) at 2.8% and engineered lumber (parallel strand lumber/laminated veneer lumber) at 2.9%.
Southern Yellow Pine (SYP) accounted for 52.7% of all lumber consumption in Texas in 1998. Various western softwood species had 36.1% of lumber market share in Texas.
Texas lumber wholesalers and retailers purchased 72.9% of their lumber directly from sawmills, 26.2% from brokers or wholesalers and 0.9% from other sources.
Texas producers had 36.4% of the market share in Texas in 1998 compared to the Southern States (other than Texas) at 25.1%. International sources (mostly Canadian) produced 22% of the lumber consumed in Texas. The Pacific Northwest contributed 9.5%, followed by Intermountain West, Central, Northeastern states at 3.8%, 1.8% and 1.4% respectively.
While Texas had a substantial market share in all Texas regions, four regions (North Central, East, Central and West Central Texas) received more than 20% of their lumber from the Southern States (other than Texas). Canada supplied from 10.2% in the Panhandle/Plains region to 42.1% to the Gulf Coast/Golden Triangle region. The Pacific Northwest shipped 24.8% of the lumber consumed in the West Central Texas region.


Panel Products

Hardwood plywood comprised 32.9% of the total panel products purchased for the Texas market, followed by OSB at 22%, Medium Density Fiberboard at 14.1%, softwood plywood at 13.1% and particleboard at 10.1%. Insulation board (3.4%), wood/cement board (1.9%), and hardboard (1.6%) made up a small portion of the market.
Texas produced 3,170 million square feet (mmsf) and consumed 3,337 mmsf of structural panel products (plywood and OSB) in 1998. Texas exported 1,075 mmsf to and imported 1,243 mmsf from other states and foreign markets.
Texas panel product distributors purchased 87.3% of the panel products they carried in 1998 from manufacturers, 8.1% from brokers or wholesalers and 4.6% from other sources.
Texas producers of panel products had 62.8% of the market share in Texas in 1998, compared to the Southern States (other than Texas) at 26.7%, the Pacific Northwest at 5.7%, and International sources (mostly Canadian) at 3.2%. The North Central region of Texas consumed the most panel products in 1998, 28.1% of Texas’ total consumption. The Southern States (other than Texas) shipped 55.4% of those panel products to the North Central region compared to 27.2% from Texas.
Four product related factors (Price, Quality, Availability and Logistics), which were rated most important, and four service and marketing related factors (Contacted by Seller, Contact Ease, Requested by Customers and Other), of lesser importance, contributed to decisions to purchase from non-Texas lumber and panel products producers. This was consistent for hardwood lumber, softwood lumber, and plywood and OSB.
Texas consumed 71% of the softwood lumber, 86.9% of the hardwood lumber and 66.1% of the plywood and OSB produced in Texas. The Southern States (other than Texas) consumed 15.3%, 6.8% and 10.4% respectively. The Central States accounted for 6.2% of the softwood lumber, 5.6% of the hardwood lumber and 4.6% of the plywood and OSB consumption. The Southwest and Other States consumed 1.8% and 5.3% of the softwood lumber produced in Texas, respectively. No hardwood lumber was reportedly shipped from Texas to the Southwest and Other States regions. The Southwest states received 2.3% of the plywood and OSB from Texas, while Other States consumed 16.4% of the plywood and OSB produced in Texas. Less than one percent of these products were sold to international customers.

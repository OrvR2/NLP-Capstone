SANTA ANA, Calif. — Prosecutors on Wednesday argued that 10 Muslim university students broke the law when they shouted down a speech by the Israeli ambassador on a Southern California campus in a case that has stoked an impassioned public debate about freedom of speech.
The basic facts of the case were laid out in opening statements before the jury and an audience of several dozen community members: A group of Muslim students carefully planned a protest and, one by one, stood up and shouted scripted statements at the ambassador at the University of California, Irvine in 2010.
Jurors will be asked to decide whether students' actions that night violated the law in a case where some community members have alleged that the defendants are being singled out because they are Muslim.
The case has also raised questions about prosecutorial discretion as some members of the public – including some who disapproved of the Muslim students' actions – say student protests are nothing new and the case is a waste of taxpayers' money.
The students face misdemeanor charges of conspiring to disrupt a meeting and disrupting a meeting. If convicted, they could face a sentence ranging from probation with community service and fines to up to a year in jail.
In opening statements Wednesday, Assistant District Attorney Dan Wagner said emails from the leader of UC Irvine's Muslim Student Union show that students drafted a detailed game plan to disrupt Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren's talk on U.S.-Israel relations.
They followed the plan to the letter by reading scripted statements before being escorted out of the event by authorities, Wagner said.
The students later tried to make it appear as if each student acted on his own, when they had coordinated the demonstration at a publicized event attended by hundreds of students and community members, he said.
"What their intention was, make no mistake, was to shut him down," Wagner told the jury.
But defense attorneys said the students planned their protest within the boundaries of the law and their combined statements lasted no longer than five minutes.
They also noted that Oren was able to finish his speech and argued that delays in the event entitled "U.S. Israel Relations from a Political and Personal Perspective" stemmed from organizers' introductory remarks and a private reception that ran late.
"Each statement is for roughly five seconds. Some of the longest ones go 8 seconds – no more," Dan Mayfield, who represents two of the defendants, said in his opening statement. "The evidence will show the interruption by the defendants – all of them together_ lasts roughly a minute."
The students, many who have since graduated from college, claim they had a right to protest. But Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas contends that right ended when it infringed on the wishes of hundreds of members of the public who had come to hear Oren.
Authorities say the students shouted out phrases such as "you are a war criminal" and "propagating murder is not an expression of free speech." The students were cited and released and disciplined at the university, which revoked the Muslim Student Union's charter for a quarter during the academic year and placed it on two years of probation.
Nearly a year later, Rackauckas filed criminal charges against 11 students, which prompted an outcry from the American Civil Liberties Union and a host of Jewish, Muslim and campus groups.
The filing sparked a media frenzy and Superior Court Judge Peter J. Wilson eventually issued a gag order to prevent prosecutors and defense attorneys from arguing the case outside the courtroom.
Since then, the charges against one defendant have been dropped, but 10 students – some who attended UC Irvine and others who attended the nearby University of California, Riverside – still face prosecution.
The case has split residents of affluent Orange County, a traditionally Republican-stronghold that is home to sizable Jewish and Muslim populations. Residents have written vociferous letters to the editor of the local newspaper, the Orange County Register, on both sides of the debate.
Salam Al-Marayati, executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, told reporters outside the courthouse on Wednesday that he believes the students are being singled out for protesting against the Israeli government's actions in Gaza, noting that President Barack Obama is frequently heckled by protesters who aren't criminally charged.
Moutaz Herzallah, whose son is one of the defendants, said he has never heard of American students being tried over protests.
"I decided to immigrate to this country with my family so we could have peace, freedom of speech, dignity and honor," said Herzallah, a Palestinian who came here from Bahrain several decades ago. "Apparently, the district attorney of Orange County threw the American Constitution in the trash."
That isn't how everyone sees it. Michael Shapiro, a law professor at the University of Southern California, said charging the students with conspiracy isn't necessary to uphold free speech rights in this case since campus authorities already did so by enabling Oren to give his talk and by disciplining students who participated in the outburst.
But the students don't have a constitutional right to shout down a speaker, he said.
"It is just maddening and outrageous that they think they have a free speech right to shut everybody else up," Shapiro said. "That's not the way the First Amendment works."

				Let me start by saying that I think the kind of protest exhibited by these California students is utterly deplorable­.  These students want to exercise their freedom of speech - that is all too clear.  But there's a funny thing about free speech: it doesn't just apply to one group of people.  Oren is just as entitled to freedom of speech as the students are.  There's an ugly double standard there that's perpetuate­d all of the time at some of these more radical colleges (and elsewhere)­.

The fact of the matter is that they wholly obstructed a speaker from, well, speaking.  A very similar incident occurred recently at Western MA's Hampshire College.  A member of the IDF came to speak and was eventually totally drowned out by the ineffably barbaric behavior of Hampshire students.  Here's the clincher: the administra­tion really did nothing of consequenc­e in response.

I commend UC Irvine for doing what Hampshire did not have the willingnes­s or the basic courage to do: stand up to a very vocal and left-wing extremist minority by telling them: "Guess what?  Your radical beliefs do NOT give you the right to act in a reprehensi­ble manner with impunity."

				It is definitely free speech. Why the question?
Even if they protest the President of America, it is the freedom to disagree peacefully that makes us such a great nation. Not to mention the good that goes out of unbridled free and open expression of college students.
I repeat, peaceful, non-violen­t expression­.

				I would make the argument that acting in a verbally obstructiv­e and borderline abusive manner is really not peaceful.

Here's the problem with unbridled free and open expression in this manner: The real world just doesn't take that kind of BS.  Say one of these protesting students is someday an attorney.  If he/she doesn't like the opposing argument, he/she could try his/her darndest to just keep preventing the other attorney from speaking.  But that's obstructin­g the proceeding­s.  It just wouldn't fly.

				There is no free speech issue. No one says they didn't have the right to say what they wanted to. The way they choose to do it by interrupti­ng a speech was wrong though. Just like you really don't have the freedom to yell "Fire" you don't really have to freedom to interrupt whoever you want at anytime. That being said, criminal charges is way too much. The university could have discipline­d them in many ways short of criminal charges and they did by putting them on probation.

				The students approach certainly was not an acedemic approach though perhaps more of the home approach.
It was the Authority symbol perhaps which they were in reality enraged with and which they obviously felt powerless against and used the only weapon powerless people have, raw force and in this case screaming so loud authority could not be heard and they could be recognized­.

They want to be seen, heard and listened to with dignity and respect.

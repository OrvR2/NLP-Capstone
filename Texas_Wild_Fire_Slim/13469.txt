Frustration Grows For Texas Wildfire Evacuees

Reported by: WROC-TV


    Residents left homeless by a massive Central
 Texas wildfire turned their attention Friday to what they need to move 
forward, with some voicing frustration over a perceived delay in federal
 response even as early signs of recovery appeared in reopened 
neighborhoods.

Firefighters focused on extinguishing 
hotspots and had isolated remaining flames from the blaze that has 
burned for almost a week in and around the city of Bastrop, destroying 
nearly 1,400 homes and sweeping across about 45 square miles of 
rain-starved landscape.


Still, thousands of evacuees were prevented 
from returning to their homes for a sixth day because trees continued to
 burn underground, loose power lines hung from scorched poles and more 
than 800 firefighters were working to tamp down the remainder of the 
fire 25 miles east of Austin.
FEMA
 spokeswoman Rachel Racusen said on Friday the agency "received the 
first request from the governor for individual aid to help Texas 
residents whose homes were damaged or destroyed in the fires, or who 
suffered other personal losses."
The move allows federal funding to be made 
available to individuals in Bastrop County. Assistance can include 
grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover 
uninsured property losses and other programs.



Texas is in the midst of its worst wildfire 
outbreak in state history. A perilous mix of hot temperatures, strong 
winds and a historic drought spawned the Bastrop-area fire, the largest 
of the nearly 190 wildfires the state forest service says erupted this 
week, killing four people, destroying more than 1,700 homes and forcing 
thousands to evacuate.
The Texas Forest Service said Friday that 
the Bastrop fire had racked up a bill of at least $1.2 million so far. 
But the agency cautioned the figure was an early estimate and was 
expected to climb. The early price tag includes firefighting costs but 
not damage caused by the blaze.
A DC-10 jet originally meant to dump fire 
retardant on the Central Texas wildfires was diverted Friday to help 
firefighters with a stubborn 22,000-acre blaze straddling three rural 
counties northwest of Houston. The fire in Montgomery, Grimes and Waller
 counties forced some people in the area to leave their homes, but was 
not threatening any towns or cities.
In Bastrop, tables set up at the entrance to
 a neighborhood that had reopened a day earlier filled up with donated 
clothing and toiletries. A first aid station was assembled and streets 
began to buzz with tree-trimming crews and building contractors.
Officials also announced that schools would 
reopen Monday. But Bastrop Independent School District superintendent 
Steve Murray said, "We anticipate the homeless student count in Bastrop 
ISD to triple, quadruple or even more."
To deal with that, school officials were developing plans to pick up students at hotels, shelters and other locations.

Lillie Pride BrownI am writing to praise the interviewing skills of Ms. Jamie Gangel. She did a masterful job of interviewing former vie-president Cheney last week. I don't even like him, but I watched intently because for the first time in a long time, I saw an interviewer who did not impose herself on the story and asked short, to the point questions that allowed the guest to express himself. How refreshing! She could give the Today Show crew lessons.
#1 - Wed Sep 7, 2011 11:05 AM EDTjackierawlingsWell Brian you will be seeing the next US President during the Republican/Tea Party debate.  Charles and David Koch said proudly the following
During Secret Retreat With Billionaires, Koch Lobbyist Admits Tea Party Group ‘Designed’ To Elect Republicans In 2010
Now the same is being done for the Presidential election.  Everything is in place and if necessary the 5 paid US Supreme Court Justices will appoint a Republican/Tea Party President.   Just think as the World watches citizens remove Dictators and take their country back, the Americans set back and watch Corporations take over the United States.  Can't blame the Koch Bros because it's just to easy and all they had to do was buy law makers, Judges and Justices to do it.
This is can't come fast enough for the corrupt Banks who got caught in their 8 years of crime and illegal foreclosures.  The DOJ has charged 15 banks with corruption and the Banks will try to stall the cases until a new President and Attorney General can drop all the charges.   Finally the reason China kicked Hank Paulson out of the Economic meeting as China said they would wait for the new US President.  Well it seems China learned of the illegal subprime and called Paulson on it.  Yes China knew the corruption done by the US Banks before anyone ever reported it as the scam worked well.   That was the rush for the 700 bailout aka bonus money because the World Economist knew about their crimes. Now President Obama  and his Administration are getting indictments and the Banks need a Republican/Tea Party President to get all this dismissed. 
see you same time same place#2 - Wed Sep 7, 2011 12:17 PM EDTjustBfairAnd you do not think George Soros helped bank roll our current president. After three years, I am convinced Obama is not smart enough to engineer it by himself.#2.1 - Wed Sep 7, 2011 7:18 PM EDTjackierawlingsyou might be right but at lease we don't have to vote for President this time.  What has to stop is the 15 Banks indicted for criminal acts and poor CEO of Goldman Sachs has to get a criminal attorney because of his corruption charges.  We need the Corporation and Koch Bros to take over this country and get people to get  back to knowing their place and doing as their told.  Perry has his 50/50 the haves and have nots.  The have nots have no health care, educations and the lowest paid jobs but the people accept what their told.#2.2 - Wed Sep 7, 2011 8:34 PM EDTDrew DavidsonMr. Williams,
Please give more questions and airtime to Mr. Huntsman during this debate. He seems to be the only candidate that is willing to work with both sides of the political spectrum in our country to bring growth and reason back to our great nation. Since when has compromise been such a dirty word? I'm a Republican, and I HATE the Tea Party for hijacking my party and being so extreme and unwilling to work with other parts of our government to create viable solutions. Mr. Huntsman needs to be seen and heard by the majority of Americans who are not blinded by the extreme left or extreme right.  If the GOP fails to nominate a more centrist candidate, I will refuse to support my party's nominee, and I believe that there is a large population of reasonable Republicans that feel likewise.
Thank you.#3 - Wed Sep 7, 2011 1:51 PM EDTPhyllis KunzMr Davidson
You said it for me, good post comment.
Phyllis Kunz#4 - Wed Sep 7, 2011 2:16 PM EDTGinny SunderlandI would not expect too much of Brian Williams.  He is more of a political commentator than a newsman.  His biases are so extreme he is incapable of any kind of reasoned or fair questioning. #5 - Wed Sep 7, 2011 3:28 PM EDTDave, Tn-1853132Drudge has a link to some online video game where you can slaughter Tea Party characters. Go have some fun before the goonions take all the SOBs out.#6 - Wed Sep 7, 2011 3:29 PM EDTjustBfairUnited States has fallen to 5th place in Global Competitiveness. This must be what President Obama meant when he said "we are 5 days away from the fundamental transformation of America". Maybe now, he will not have to apologize for America anymore.#7 - Wed Sep 7, 2011 7:28 PM EDTjackierawlingsBrian the Debate was so embarrassing to watch.  Bachmann said gas prices were one dollar when Obama took office. Fake Perry has 50/50 the haves and the have nots. Texas has the highest rate of uneducated kids and 50 per cent of Texas citizens have no health care. Perry wants to make that the same way for the USA.  Romney is brought and sold by Corporate America.  Ron Paul is to funny as he's living in 1900.  Not one candidate said what they would do and only attack the President.  Tonight the World got to see the worse of the candidates we have to choose from.  Republicans need their own candidate enter the race as for those today their clearly not qualified to lead our country.  Make a call to Chuck Hagel before it's to late.  Republicans have no representation right now in the race for President.#8 - Wed Sep 7, 2011 9:32 PM EDTLeave a Comment:Name: Email Address (will be verified, but never shown): You're in Easy Mode.

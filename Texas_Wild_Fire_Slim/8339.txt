Mutharika shrinks Malawi cabinet in nod to criticsAFP – 19 hrs ago

Malawi President Bingu wa Mutharika on Wednesday announced a downsized cabinet that includes his wife and his brother, but trims 14 portfolios in a nod to demands from civic society.
Mutharika in August had dissolved his 42-member cabinet, one month after deadly anti-government riots that killed 19 people in July.
With his new line-up, Mutharika sacked finance minister Ken Kandodo, who had championed a "zero-deficit budget" seeking to use local resources to replace aid money lost when several donor nations cut their financial support over concerns about poor governance.
Kandodo, a grand nephew of the late dictator Kamuzu Banda, was replaced by former tourism minister Ken Lipenga.
Mutharika, who also serves as commander-in-chief of the police and the armed services, kept three minor portfolios for himself and named his wife Callista as national coordinator for women and children's health.
Her $7,500 monthly salary as first lady had angered rights activists who charged that she should not be paid for doing charity work as the president's wife.
His brother Arthur Peter Mutharika, who has already been endorsed as presidential candidate for the ruling party in 2014, was moved from education to foreign affairs.
The president is under fire over chronic fuel and foreign exchange shortages and is also accused of infringing democratic freedoms in the impoverished southern African country.
Demands for a smaller Cabinet were included in a petition handed to authorities by activists on July 20, when deadly riots erupted after police moved to put down demonstrations criticising Mutharika's governance.
Worsening donor ties and a spat with former colonial power Britain triggered twin expulsions of envoys, followed by London's cutting of direct aid in July over concerns over economic management and governance.
Since the unprecedented riots, the central bank has devalued the local kwacha currency, which the government had resisted despite the International Monetary Fund arguing it was over-valued.

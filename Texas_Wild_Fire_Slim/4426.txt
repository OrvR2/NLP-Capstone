No one can tell Tim Lincecum and Clayton Kershaw that nothing's at stake in the National League West.
They pitch for the second- and third-place teams in a race that's all but wrapped up, but neither was close to surrendering a thing Friday night. In fact, it was just the opposite. Each approached the game as the biggest of the year, and their desire and drive to outduel one another served as a splendid story line for the opener of a late-season series between the Giants and Dodgers.
In the end, the Giants (in particular, Santiago Casilla) flinched.
Eugenio Velez (remember him?) scored the deciding run in the top of the ninth inning, and the Giants were 2-1 losers. They dropped another game in the standings and sit 8 1/2 games behind first-place Arizona with 18 to play.
"I definitely wanted to beat that guy because of what he's done against us," Lincecum said of Kershaw, who's 3-0 with a 0.00 ERA at the Giants' park this year and hasn't allowed an earned run there in 32 2/3 innings dating to August 2010. "I've managed to go head-to-head against him a lot."
Considering no team in history overcame a deficit as big as 7 1/2 games with 19 to play - the Giants' predicament coming in - perhaps it's time for the eternal optimists to face reality and tip their caps to the Diamondbacks.
The Dodgers, 12 games out of first place, have a purpose over the final 2 1/2 weeks to catch the fading Giants, whom they trail by just 3 1/2 games. As Lincecum said, the teams are playing "for a different cause."
Friday, the Dodgers won for the 14th time in 17 games since Aug. 23, and only the Diamondbacks (at 15-2) own a better record in that stretch. The Giants led 1-0 through seven innings, and the only run off Lincecum came in an eighth-inning rally that started when Matt Kemp hit a ball about 20 feet down the third-base line, seemingly making contact at dirt level.
Kemp stole second and scored on Juan Rivera's single past Lincecum. Rivera swung and missed a 3-0 changeup before connecting on a 92-mph fastball. 
"Biggest pitch of the game," said Lincecum, who is 0-2 with a 1.66 ERA in four 2011 starts versus the Dodgers. The Giants' offense gave him five runs of support total. 
Lincecum was replaced in the bottom of the eighth for pinch-hitter Mark DeRosa, who popped out with Chris Stewart on first base. Stewart eventually exited with a right ankle injury, and pinch-runner Darren Ford stole second, but Justin Christian struck out to end the inning.
In the Dodgers' half of the ninth, with one away and the infield playing in, pinch-hitter Jamey Carroll hit a grounder to second baseman Jeff Keppinger, whose throw home was on the wrong side of the plate. 
Velez, running for Rod Barajas, who opened the inning with a single, advanced on a sacrifice and wild pitch.
Christian scored the Giants' only run on Pablo Sandoval's first-inning single, one of three hits surrendered by Kershaw. Christian reached on shortstop Dee Gordon's error and stole second.
"Just trying to match him," Kershaw said of Lincecum, "He's an awesome pitcher, obviously. You know it's going to be a low-scoring game."

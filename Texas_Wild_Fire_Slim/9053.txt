Perry, Romney Tee Off
Texas governor makes his presidential debate debut

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry made his debate debut tonight, and it's clear the new frontrunner is happy to mix it up. He and Mitt Romney went after each other with gusto, notes  AP , as evidenced by an early exchange: After Perry criticized Romney's record of creating jobs in Massachusetts, Romney...

Ann Coulter: Palin Is 'the Obama of the Tea Party'
And she should 'just run so we can get this over with'

(Newser) -
                                    Ann Coulter is the latest pundit to jump into the “will she or won’t she?” discussion about Sarah Palin’s potential presidential run, and she has a message for Palin: “Fish or cut bait, because you are ginning up this group of Americans who will not even...

What to Watch for in Tonight's Debate
Will Perry make a good impression? Can Bachmann survive?

(Newser) -
                                    Sure, some of them have faced off before—but tonight’s Politico/NBC News debate marks the first time  new frontrunner Rick Perry  will join the fray, making it what  Politico  calls the “first Fall Classic” for 2012 GOP presidential hopefuls. And it’s the start of a busy month...

Bachmann's Campaign Manager Steps Down
Ed Rollins said Bachmann was losing momentum before stepping down

(Newser) -
                                    Trouble in political paradise? Senior Republican strategist Ed Rollins, who helped Michele Bachmann win the Iowa straw poll last month, is stepping down as Bachmann's campaign manager, citing health issues, reports  Politico . "I wish I was 40 years old, but I'm not," he said. "I'...

Romney Boasts His Health-Care Law Is 'Big Asset'
Romney seeks middle as other GOP candidates vie for right

(Newser) -
                                    With the GOP presidential candidates vying to be the rightest-of-the-right at yesterday's Freedom Forum in South Carolina, Mitt Romney kept focused on the general election, where wooing moderates is key, reports  Politico . For example, he defended the need for federal regulations. “Regulation is necessary to make a free...

WSJ: Huntsman Tax Plan Shows the Way
His proposal is best of any GOP candidate, says editorial

(Newser) -
                                    Jon Huntsman may be languishing in the polls, but his  newly released plan  to overhaul the tax code and shrink the government is winning high praise from an influential voice—the editorial page of the  Wall Street Journal . His "proposal is as impressive as any to date in the...

Bachmann Gives Up on NH
Campaign confirms she's focusing on Iowa, South Carolina

(Newser) -
                                    Where’s Michele Bachmann? Well, she’s certainly not in New Hampshire. She hasn’t visited the state since two months ago, and she canceled her last planned visit, after the Ames straw poll. In fact, every single 2012 GOP candidate other than Bachmann has been to New Hampshire since...

George Bush's Failure Paved Way for Rick Perry
GOP wants a pure conservative, not a 'compassionate' one: Steve Kornacki

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry is sitting at or near the top of the GOP field mainly because of George W. Bush, writes Steve Kornacki in  Salon . But it's not just because of the obvious— that Perry became governor of Texas when Bush defeated Al Gore. "It has to do with...

After Iowa Stop, Palin Heads Straight to NH
Probably just a coincidence...

(Newser) -
                                    In her continued bid to do absolutely nothing to quell speculation about a run for the Oval Office, Sarah Palin has decided to take a little getaway following her much ballyhooed Sept. 3 appearance in Iowa: to scenic New Hampshire, reports the  Iowa Republican . "High-level Iowa Republicans" tell the...

Jewish Donors Think Bachmann Is ... Jewish
And that's bad news for Mitt Romney's quest for cash

(Newser) -
                                    Michele Bachmann  likes to talk to crowds  about "the creator of the universe, our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ." Yet for some reason, some Jewish donors think she's ... Jewish. And what may be good for her campaign coffers is bad news for Romney's, according to the...

                                    Joe McQuaid, publisher of New Hampshire’s  Union Leader , was at the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester during a recent visit from Mitt Romney, and he got a bit of much-needed clarification on an issue that’s been bothering some people: Why in the world is Romney giving his foes...

Also, he explains how a napkin relates to gay marriage

(Newser) -
                                    You may have heard that certain members of the gay community  are not huge fans  of presidential contender Rick Santorum. Well, Santorum himself is well aware of that fact, and during a South Carolina campaign stop Friday, he accused the gay community of having "gone out on a, I...

To make Washington spend less

(Newser) -
                                    Michele Bachmann is the latest candidate to make the risky political move of “attributing political motive to natural disasters,” as Alexander Burns writes for  Politico . The  St. Petersburg Times  reports that this weekend at a campaign event in Florida, while praising the Tea Party for its focus on...

Perry Calls Social Security a 'Ponzi Scheme'—Again
But, he insists, he has never said it's unconstitutional

(Newser) -
                                    Though Rick Perry’s aides have been  disavowing some of the views  expressed in his nine-month-old book Fed Up!, the presidential candidate himself doesn’t seem to be doing the same. In Iowa on Saturday, Perry reiterated the opinion stated in his book that Social Security “is a Ponzi...

...as long as it's done 'responsibly'

(Newser) -
                                    Speaking in Florida yesterday, Michele Bachmann supported drilling for oil and natural gas wherever we can find them, even in the Everglades—as long as we do it “responsibly,” the  AP  reports. “The United States needs to be less dependent on foreign sources of energy and more...

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry's presidential campaign comes with a large security detail provided by Texas state police, but its costs are going to secret for the next 18 months, thanks to a provision added to a school finance bill, reports the  Washington Post .

Tea Party Favorite: Rick Perry
And 58% of Republicans and right-leaning independents like the Tea Party

(Newser) -
                                    Turns out that Rick Perry holds a substantial lead among Tea Party supporters. Here's the new  Gallup  breakdown: Perry holds the same 21-point advantage, 35% to 14%, over Mitt Romney and Michele Bachmann among Tea Party backers. Also, 58% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents back the Tea Party. That...

She also advocates reducing corporate taxes

                                    Michele Bachmann says everything would be on the table in her administration when it came to trying to boost employment—including dropping the federal minimum wage. Asked yesterday if she would consider changing the minimum wage to make US labor costs more competitive with overseas costs, she replied, "I'...

Perry Backed Billions in Tax Hikes
Tea Party favorite not always on Norquist's good side

(Newser) -
                                    He may be an anti-tax champion now, but Rick Perry has supported billions of dollars in tax hikes throughout his political career—among them the biggest increase that ever occurred in Texas history, the  Texas Tribune  reports. Just weeks ago, the governor signed an online sales tax provision aimed at...

To Win This, Rick Perry Needs to Look Less Angry
Conservatives can't afford to be painted as radicals, Peggy Noonan writes

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry appears to be a “natural conservative, Texas Division,” and that’s awfully appealing for the Republican base, but he’s also got a glaring flaw, writes Peggy Noonan of the  Wall Street Journal . Perry has “a chesty, quick-draw machismo that might be right for an...

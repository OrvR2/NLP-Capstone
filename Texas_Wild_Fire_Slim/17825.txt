The fire between Bastrop and Paige in Texas has burned approximately 600 homes and 30,000 acres, according to the Texas Forest Service. The fire has set a record for the highest number of homes lost in a single fire in Texas history.
As you can see from the map, the west flank of the fire is threatening Bastrop and is within two miles of the city limits. The strong winds blowing out of tropical storm Lee have abated somewhat, but the predicted 11 mph north-northeast winds and a relative humidity of 14% today will continue to challenge firefighters charged with protecting the town of Bastrop.
The Boise National Incident Management Organization team, Incident Commander Steve Gage, has assisted with the management of the fire. A type 1 team has been ordered. Numerous subdivisions, approximately 5,000 residents, have been evacuated.
Author and photographer Deanna Roy took a very impressive photo of the Bastrop fire with the city of Austin in the foreground.

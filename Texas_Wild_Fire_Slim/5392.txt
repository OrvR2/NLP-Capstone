Gadhafi wife, children flee to AlgeriaBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Mon, Aug 29, 2011

Moammar Gadhafi's children Aisha, Hannibal and Mohammed, and wife Safia entered Algeria. …As Libyan rebels continue to hunt for Moammar Gadhafi near his hometown of Sirte, the one-time Libyan strongman's wife and three of his children have entered Algeria, the official Algerian Press Agency reported Monday, citing an Algerian foreign ministry press release.
Gadhafi's second wife "Safia, daughter Aisha,  sons Hannibal and Mohamed, accompanied by their children entered Algeria  at 08h45 AM [Monday] via the Algerian-Libyan border," the news agency reported. The "UN secretary general, UN Security Council and Mahmoud Jibril,  head of Executive Council of Libyan National Transition Council were  informed, the release added."
The Algerian Embassy did not immediately respond to a query from The Envoy about the report.
An American analyst on North Africa issues who blogs pseudonymously under the handle "the Moor Next Door" told The Envoy in a telephone interview Monday that it's not so surprising Gadhafi relatives would seek refuge in Algeria. Two of Gadhafi's sons already live there, the analyst noted; one son is married to an Algerian, while the other lives in Algiers.
Furthermore, he said, Algeria has maintained a more studiously neutral posture toward Gadhafi's regime than other regional powers have. Many Arab nations have long been hostile to Gadhafi and the Arab League voted to approve the NATO-led no-fly zone against Gadhafi; Algeria, meanwhile, has pursued the African model of nonalignment in the Libya crisis.  The African Union has not approved of the international intervention in Libya and has still not recognized the Libyan opposition National Transition Council, as the United States, Europe and most Arab nations have.
"To sort of understand where Algeria is coming from, the Algerians have repeatedly claimed that they were in contact with both sides of the conflict," the analyst said.
Meanwhile, Gadhafi's own whereabouts remain a mystery. Reports over the weekend suggested rebels were getting some NATO help in their bid to take his hometown of Sirte, Libya.
Separately, the State Department announced Monday that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will go to Paris for a meeting later this week of the international Contact Group on Libya--the coalition of powers involved in the Libyan intervention.

If Algeria is neutral, it should review the backgrounds of each of the Qaddafis. If any Qaddafi made decisions to kill or harm Libyan civilians, Algeria should turn them over to the International Criminal Court for trial and inform the Libyan NTC.  If a Qaddafi was not involved in government or other criminal decisions against the Libyan people, Algeria can grant that Qaddafi political asylum.  If Algeria has any Libyan money or other assets, the money and assets should be turned over to the Libyan NTC.  Algeria would be wise to follow the Arab League lead and recognise Libya's NTC.  Moammar Qaddafi should be tried in the ICC.

History is repeating itself. Just like after the fall of Ottoman Empire, the then big powers France and England discussed how to share the booty between themselves. Except this time around, there is an extra mouth to feed which is the U.S. to share the ill gotten Libyan oil reserves.

They might want to check Pakistan especially if Pakistani leaders denied it. Rumor has it that a mansion compound just came on the market there, just cleaned, had most of the blood stains from the last terrorist removed from the carpets. The beautiful grounds around this compound have been cleaned, the wrecked helicopter was just removed by the Chinese as a favor to their Pakistani friends due to the fact Pakistan could not afford to move it from the property due to funding cuts made to them by The United States so now the view is perfect once again of the large military located right up the street. Has a huge sandbox in the yard put there by a Libyan leader who stayed there in the 1980's and 1990's when staying in Pakistan for meetings with it's leaders so he could practice drawing his " Lines of Death " he and a couple other rouge terrorist dictators came up with to scare western Nations with. LOL  You never know, Gadhafi' could be there ????   Hey Washington, if he
is found in Pakistan do you think we can finally stop giving out our funds that we can't afford
to Nations that 1. Don't like us, 2. Who lie to us, and 3. Don't appreciate the help.

just another stupid move on obamas part.So after the rebels take over and squabble about who will lead.America will send money to help them get on their feet.Unfortunately the money wont be spent on books and food ratther ak 47s and rocket proppelled grenades.Then our young men will be asked to go in and root out the insurgents.Sound familiar ?

O if only the Middle Eastern communities could understand that Jesus alone is the way,the truth and the life,and that no one come to the FATHER JEHOVAH but through Him.   Check the grave of Mohamit and you will find that his remains are still there, Jesus' grave is empty,because He is now in Heaven,seated at the right hand of GOD.  There is still time to have a great Spiritual awakaning and have the entire muslim worl turn to Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour and live a life of peace and love and not of violence.  There will always be the few criminal who practice hate and violence but the nations will seek peace!!!

I would not be surprise if Momar is right now eating steak and egg in one of his underground palaces.  His family are tired of living underground so they demanded to go to their next door neighbour who are friendly with them.  Or  he may have already taken his flight underground and is enjoying the good life in Algeria.  Think about it!!!!!!!

					A&M has crazy off week

It was supposed to be a perfect off week. The Aggies would correct mistakes from a 46-14 victory over Southern Methodist, and off the field Texas A&M would join the Southeastern Conference.
We'll see if the A&M football team made any improvement, if not this week against lowly Idaho then certainly in two weeks against eighth-ranked Oklahoma State. But when A&M will officially be in the SEC is debatable, and it's frustrating all Aggies.
A&M's move to the SEC went off without a hitch right up until the SEC board of directors voted unanimously Tuesday night to accept the Aggies -- provided all Big 12 schools give up their right to litigation. That didn't seem like an obstacle since the Big 12 previously had said it wouldn't challenge A&M's exit. But Baylor said it wasn't giving up its right to sue and it was supported by others, creating a full-blown mess.
It's a foregone conclusion that A&M will join the SEC. But when and at what cost, especially from an emotional standpoint? And a bigger concern is what happens to the Big 12, which effects all of college football.
The development that turned things upside down was Oklahoma president David Boren saying the Sooners would explore their options, following the lead established by A&M president R. Bowen Loftin. OU is a marquee program, but the Sooners have only two options -- join the Pac-12 or stay in the Big 12. That's because the Sooners don't want to be in the SEC, and the Big Ten doesn't want the Sooners.
So what should OU do?
I'd say stay in the Big 12, which is the same thing Texas is saying along with Baylor and its buddies. And that's exactly why OU might head west.
A program the stature of OU doesn't want to play second fiddle, which the Aggies can understand. That's in part why the Aggies are leaving the Big 12. They want to get away from Texas. They might fall on their face, but it also might be the best thing to happen at A&M since they started admitting women.
OU has never had problems with Texas the magnitude of wanting to change conferences, until now. The Sooners, like the Aggies, aren't too thrilled about the Longhorn Network. Then there's the perception (or reality) that Texas is running the Big 12 which is why Nebraska left last year and has to be so happy it left when it did.
The Sooners have no fear of the Longhorns on the playing field, but what happens off the field in the Big 12 seemingly is being dictated by Texas. 
OU has enough swagger to say enough is enough. The Sooners could force Texas' hand by jumping to the Pac-12, taking Oklahoma State and Texas Tech with it. If Texas opted to follow, the Longhorn Network would have to become one of the Pac-12's regional networks. The Longhorns would still be a national power, but have only one vote in part because the Pac-10 has equal distribution of revenue.
What a novel concept: equal treatment of everyone off the field. Equal revenue sharing is why the SEC, Big Ten and Pac-12 are on the verge of becoming super conferences. Meanwhile the Big 12 has lost Colorado, Nebraska and Texas A&M, yet the league is trying to convince OU the future is bright.
Oklahoma State billionaire booster Boone Pickens said on Thursday night's Oklahoma State-Arizona nationally televised game that the Big 12 would survive, adding that equal revenue sharing has to be a must. Pickens, though, said last week that the Big 12 wouldn't be around much longer. Such is life in the Big 12.
Pickens' thoughts, though, don't count. Everyone is waiting on Boren and Oklahoma, a sequel to Loftin and A&M that has been much more watched and still running.
Boren said on Sept. 2 that it could take OU three days or three weeks to decide its future. We're still waiting, and Boren could opt to take more time since top-ranked Oklahoma has to play at fifth-ranked Florida State next week. And as we saw last week, more time is not necessarily a good thing with so much maneuvering.
That's when Baylor president Ken Starr realized that if OU leaves, the Big 12 is history and the Bears' future wouldn't be too bright. The same goes for Iowa State, Kansas and Kansas State. So he decided to act, setting off all kinds of possibilities.
The Pac-12 would love to have OU with or without Texas. Some who cover the Big Ten have reported that Texas and Notre Dame could join that conference if the Big 12 implodes. Meanwhile the Big 12, believe it or not, is examining its expansion options. 
And the Aggies? They just want to go to the SEC, which patiently waits. Most people agree that Baylor probably isn't going to sue A&M and the SEC, but just mentioning litigation makes presidents and chancellors uneasy. Administrators have discovered the best way to handle negative publicity is not to have it.
The SEC, the nation's best football conference, wants A&M. But you can't blame it for waiting. If OU recommits to the Big 12, it's a moot point. And if the Sooners leave, Baylor will be too concerned with finding a conference to sue another one.
This has been a lot to digest even for Aggies who didn't have a game to worry about. Then again, this is a game, a dangerous one that maybe is the biggest the sport has seen. And to think it started in College Station and could end in Norman after a stop in Waco is rather amazing.

PIC: Jonathan Taylor Thomas Turns 30US Magazine – Thu, 8 Sep, 2011 4:00 PM EDT


Welcome back, JTT!
Jonathan Taylor Thomas has stayed out of the public eye in recent years. But the former child star -- who turns 30 on Thursday -- recently reunited with the cast of the '90s sitcom Home Improvement!
PHOTOS: Child stars, all grown up!
Perez Hilton uncovered a photo of the show's reassembled cast tweeted by actress Patricia Richardson. Richardson, who played matriarch Jill Taylor on the show, confirmed that the Home Improvement cast reunited for an Entertainment Weekly shoot. "Missing Earl," she noted. (Earl Hindman, who played neighbor Wilson, passed away in 2003.)

Clad in a button-down shirt and jeans, Thomas was all smiles in the pic, sandwiched between Tim Allen and Zachery Ty Bryan, who played his brother Brad.

Thomas played the role of Randy on Home Improvement from 1991 to 1998. He also voiced the role of young Simba in the 1994 Disney film The Lion King. Other notable roles included Tom Sawyer in the 1995 film Tom and Huck, and Jake Wilkinson in 1998's I'll Be Home for Christmas, costarring Jessica Biel.
The former teen idol attended Harvard University in 2000 and later attended Columbia University.  Get more Us! Follow us on Twitter, Friend us on Facebook, Subscribe to Us Weekly

Home Improvement was one of those shows that was completely predicable but like an comfortable old sweater, you could put it on and just relax.

What is wrong people? Why are looks everything? God gave everyone beauty whether inside or out. "YOUR jealousy is showing."  Best wishes to all of them. I loved that show and still watch the reruns.

Talk about a childhood flashback. I was a little saddened on reading that "Wilson" passed away -- he was my favourite characters. =(
T.v. just isn't what it used to be.

I'm 24 and I used to be in love with JTT!  He is not at all handsome anymore and hasn't grown an inch!  In fact all three of the show's "sons" turned out to be ugly adults, despite being handsome boys. No wonder they are no longer getting acting work!   Oh well, hopefuly they've been successful in other ventures. Gotta say though, the years have treated the two women well, they look beautiful!

How long do cell phones stay in stores?








Ok so my phone is ready for an upgrade November 1st (2011) and i really want the HP Veer (AT&T). I was just wondering if they will still be selling them at best Buy in November. I'm not exactly sure how long they sell a certain cell phone. thank you for answering  
If the phone is very popular, they can stay on shelve for about a year. most phones stay on for a year-year and a half, but if the phone fails in sales, it could be gone very soon. if you still want the phone in November and no one is selling it (AT&T, best Buy) you can always buy that phone off of amazon, ebay, or your local (used) phone dealer. Amazon would be the best bet, cause you can use your upgrade and get the upgrade price + new phone. Ebay it will prob be used, and it would of course be used at a used phone store.
Cell phones stay on shelves for some days up to a few weeks. the market for phones especially smart-phones is rapidly growing you will be seeing deals coming everyday just a strategy for stores to get rid of the inventory. Visit an AT&T store and speak to a sales representative for more details. it is likely that he/she will not tell you the duration of a sale.
Usually a year, whenever they get out dated. Sometimes walmart sells old phones for cheap if they have some still in stock. Like the walmart by me sells droid x1s from last year for $50 but I bet they only have 5 in stock when that runs out then you cant buy any.

Fulham draw with Blackburn





Latest News - Blackburn remained rooted to the bottom of the table after Bobby Zamora's equaliser gave Fulham a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage.Steve Kean's struggling side had taken the lead through a fine strike from Ruben Rochina in the first half, but Zamora equalised soon after to leave Blackburn still waiting for their first league win this season.There was more bad news for Kean as midfielder David Hoilett was stretchered off in stoppage time wearing a neck brace after a nasty collision with Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer.Fulham are also without a victory in their first four league games and, like Blackburn, they were unable to climb out of the bottom three after a scrappy encounter in west London."He's got three or four stitches in the side of his head and a bang on his eye," Kean said of Hoilett's injury."It's not a great challenge and he'll have some concussion. It's a bad one."He was out for a little bit of time and it might affect him for the next game, but he'll be fine."

Reflect on Sept. 11 anniversary





Latest News - For all the journalistic firepower gathered to mark the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on Sunday, the small moments captured by cameras resonated most deeply.A 21-year-old boy regretted that his father wasn't there to help him learn how to drive a car. Young hands grasped at a name etched in a memorial as if they could touch the person himself. A young woman asked a mother no longer there if she is proud of her family.Live coverage of somber ceremonies memorializing the attack's victims dominated television networks on Sunday, the climax of two weeks of attention paid to the historical marker. Newspapers published special sections and websites offered their own content — Yahoo even observing a digital moment of silence.The television coverage was centered on the annual memorial service at New York's World Trade Center. CNN kept a timeline, occasionally flashing mileposts of what happened 10 years ago at their precise moments: as former President George W. Bush read a letter from Abraham Lincoln to the mother of five men killed in the Civil War, the screen noted that exactly 10 years ago Bush's chief of staff was whispering to his boss that "America is under attack.""The images still shock, the heartbreak still hurts," CNN's Anderson Cooper said as the network showed pictures from 2001.Sunday's coverage offered dozens of heart-rending moments, perhaps none more so than when Peter Negron, 21, recalled his father Pete, a project manager for environmental issues for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who died at the World Trade Center. He noted that he tried to teach his brother, aged 2 when their father died, things like throwing a baseball that dad had showed him. He regretted that his father wasn't there to teach him how to drive, or ask a girl out on a date.Tom Brokaw, who anchored NBC News' coverage 10 years ago and worked as a commentator with Brian Williams on Sunday, briefly struggled for composure after watching a red-eyed Paul Simon sing "The Sounds of Silence.""Music is such a critical part of these kinds of ceremonies," he said. "It evokes memories, speaks to us in a way that our everyday language cannot."Most of the networks covered the beginning of the reading of names of World Trade Center victims by family members, but cut away for other things, including ceremonies where planes hit that day at the Pentagon and Shanksville, Penn.That made for some discordant moments, such as when ABC's George Stephanopoulos asked Robin Roberts to describe what the screen already had shown."Can you just give us a sense of what it is like where the names are being read?" Stephanopoulos asked."I'm trying to keep my voice down," Roberts replied. "Everyone is being very respectful in listening to the names being read."Fox introduced a reporter by injecting an odd sense of competition, saying he had been the first to report that the towers had fallen down — a picture seen live by millions 10 years ago.Perhaps most powerfully, CBS News stuck with the list of names longer than its rivals, each reader ending with an often heartbreaking personal tribute. Still, the network ended its three-hour coverage without even reaching the halfway point through the alphabetical list."It takes a very long time to read 3,000 names," CBS' Scott Pelley said. "It's a reminder of the enormity of what happened."New York affiliates of the broadcast networks, as has been their tradition, stuck with the readings after network coverage went off the air. Fox and CNN ran lists of victims' names on the bottom of their screens throughout the morning.The Associated Press provided live video from the memorial service. It also produced a running moment to moment timeline, contrasting what was happening Sunday to what was happening in those moments 10 years earlier.The New York Times published a 40-page special section, "The Reckoning," on Sunday, with a cover picture of the reflecting pool at ground zero. An interactive package with the same name includes a graphic tally of the cost of 9/11 to the United States, an estimated $3.3 trillion. The Times is also collecting comments about where people were on that day and how they feel now.A web package put together by The Wall Street Journal contained graphics showing how lower Manhattan around ground zero has become a more residential community. Cameras from different vantage points give online visitors views of rebuilding at the World Trade Center.Yahoo halted service on its website for a minute at 8:46 a.m. ET, 10 years after the first plane hit the North Tower, a digital moment of silence. Facebook added ways for users to dedicate profile photos and status updates to 9/11 victims. Google's home site had a black ribbon and the phrase, "Remembering September 11th."YouTube started a specific 9/11 channel, asking viewers to submit videos with their thoughts.Advertisers in special newspaper sections tailored their messages to the occasion. The New York Daily News' 80-page special section contained memorial ads from Macy's, the utility Con Edison, Emblem Health, Key Food, the New York Jets and the Eye Bank of New York. Some tried to do business: The Bradford Exchange offered commemorative plaques, pendants and sculptures for sale.

Galaxy to clinch a playoff berth





Latest News - The Galaxy made official Friday night what they have known for weeks.Landon Donovan's goal gave Los Angeles a 1-0 victory over the Colorado Rapids and made the Galaxy the first Major League Soccer team to clinch a playoff berth."I think that was a bit of a foregone conclusion," Galaxy defender Todd Dunivant said.Los Angeles moved seven points clear of Seattle in the race for the Supporters' Shield, awarded to the team that finishes with the best regular-season record. Los Angeles captured the prize last season and is eyeing a repeat."It would be nice to win the Supporters' Shield," Galaxy coach Bruce Arena said. "That's the next objective for us."Donovan scored his league high-tying 12th goal in the 36th minute off a feed from Sean Franklin to help the Galaxy (15-3-10) remain unbeaten in 14 home matches.After a handful of strong chances in the first half went for naught, the Galaxy managed to convert one before the break.David Beckham started the goal-scoring sequence near the right sideline, playing a short pass to Chad Barrett, who knocked it to a streaking Franklin. Following a dribble, Franklin beat the Rapids' last line of defense with a pass to Donovan, who was left unguarded and finished with a low strike that goalie Matt Pickens was unable to reach.Donovan matched New York's Thierry Henry for most goals in the league."Landon's finish was critical," Dunivant said. "Nobody is going to save that."The defending champion Rapids (10-8-11) lost their second straight following a six-game unbeaten streak.Colorado had won the previous two games in the series at the Home Depot Center."In a stadium where we have had good fortune in the past, tonight was not to be for us," Colorado coach Gary Smith said.Galaxy goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts started in net for the first time since fracturing his left ulna against San Jose on June 25. Ricketts, who missed eight league matches following surgery, wasn't called into action often.The Rapids' best chance at an equalizer was negated by an offside call in the 57th minute. Ricketts made a diving deflection of Sanna Nyassi's shot, sending the ball loose in the box. Wells Thompson cleaned up the rebound but was a step behind the defense while putting the ball into the net.Former U.S. national team coach Bob Bradley was in attendance watching as a spectator. Bradley, who was fired from his post in July after a nearly five-year stint, has been in discussions with Egypt about its coaching vacancy.

Old Trafford horror for Arsenal





Latest News - Arsenal will aim to bounce back from their Old Trafford horror show on Saturday as they make a fresh start to their Premier League campaign against newly promoted Swansea.A miserable month of August which began with the departure of Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri culminated with the club's 8-2 humiliation at Manchester United, the heaviest defeat suffered by the Gunners in 115 years.Since then Arsene Wenger has bolstered his squad with a slew of signings, including South Korea captain Park Chu-Young, Mikel Arteta from Everton and German international Per Mertesacker.Whether the arrival of Park, Arteta and Mertesacker, along with the recruitment of Brazilian defender Andre Santos and Yossi Benayoun, will transform Arsenal's season remains to be seen.But midfielder Aaron Ramsey revealed the Gunners are determined to stop the rot following their traumatic outing in Manchester."We want to put things right after our last result," said Ramsey. "Hopefully we put in a really good performance and get back to winning ways."We have had a good think about things and it will be a fresh start now.""We have brought in some quality players, Arteta and Benayoun are two creative midfielders who are really comfortable on the ball and they will be great additions to the squad."Ramsey however warned his team-mates against complacency, having had first-hand experience of Swansea last season during a loan spell with Cardiff."I saw last season, when I played against Swansea for Cardiff, that they are a good footballing team and like to pass the ball," Ramsey said."It will be a good footballing game but hopefully we come out on top and get all three points."While Arsenal are chasing their first league win of the season, leaders United will attempt to maintain their 100 percent start to the season at Bolton.United goalkeeper David de Gea is likely to be face another testing afternoon as he continues to acclimatise to the physicality of the Premier League.However United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is confident that de Gea, who has already conceded soft goals against Manchester City and West Bromwich Albion this season, has the talent to be a success."David made a couple of mistakes in his first games, which we didn't expect and nor did he," Ferguson said."There is no doubt we have a player of great potential. Our job at this club is to realise that potential and make sure he becomes a top goalkeeper," Ferguson added."He'll do that once he gains experience and adapt to the physical nature of the league."It is a different game here compared to Spain - there are more crosses to deal with and there is more contact. Bit by bit, we will get there with him."United's cross-town rivals Manchester City meanwhile are expected to hand a home debut to new signing Nasri -- exceptional in the club's 5-1 away win at Tottenham -- as they face Wigan at Eastlands.Wigan manager Roberto Martinez admits City, who like United have maximum points after three games, have the look of potential champions."You are always looking at what you are doing rather than the opposition but you look at Manchester City, and you feel it's only a matter of time before they are competing to win the Premier League," Martinez said."You just hope that we are playing them at a time when we can disrupt them and not allow them to be themselves."They have assembled probably the best squad of 20 footballers anywhere in the world, and that's obviously a fantastic position to be in."It's only a matter of time before they click, and they are going to be challenging for the title very soon - there`s no two ways about that."Chelsea meanwhile will welcome back goalkeeper Petr Cech and defender David Luiz from injury for their trip to Sunderland.Stoke will attempt to extend their unbeaten Premier League record against Liverpool at the Britannia, where new Potters signing Peter Crouch is expected to line up against his former club.

Expert excluded from EU-China





Latest News - Expert excluded from EU-China, The European Union says it deeply regrets China's exclusion of a human rights expert from a forum held in Beijing this week.
The EU office in Beijing said in a statement Thursday that it communicated its disappointment to the Chinese side, but it did not name the individual involved.
New York-based Human Rights in China said one of its experts who had been invited to represent the International Federation of Human Rights had been refused a visa to attend at the last minute.
It said it was told the Chinese Foreign Ministry regarded HRIC as an "anti-China" group whose participation in the seminar was "totally unacceptable."
China has sought to deflect criticisms of its human rights record by holding such closed-door forums.

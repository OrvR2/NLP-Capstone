Texas Gov. Rick Perry's request denied



 
By: CNN's Rebecca Stewart 


(CNN)- Gov. Rick Perry continued his tirade against President Obama late Tuesday, when the administration's decision to deny his request for a disaster declaration for the state of Texas was finalized.
Perry requested a declaration from the president in mid-April to clear the way for federal funding and assist in state efforts to fight wildfires that have burned over 2.2 million acres of land.

"I am dismayed that this administration has denied Texans the much needed assistance they deserve," Perry said, in a statement. "It is not only the obligation of the federal government, but its responsibility under law to help its citizens in times of emergency."
And for Perry, the issue may not be settled.
"We will immediately look at all of our options, including appealing the denial, so Texans can receive the resources and support they need as wildfires continue to threaten life and property across our state," he continued.
The Republican governor, who's made no secret of his displeasure with President Obama in the past, went on to list actions that state government has taken to aid residents in distress including deploying Texas Forest Service personnel to assist with multiple fires, Texas Military Forces to help with fire suppression, and the Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid System.
Perry sought additional federal assistance through a Major Disaster Declaration which must be approved by the president.
But, while the request was being reviewed, the state wasn't exactly left in the lurch.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved 25 fire management assistance grants in April, specifically designed to support firefighting efforts. They cover 75 percent of the state's emergency response work for each fire, according to FEMA spokeswoman Rachel Racusen who objected to Perry's claims of neglect in a statement Wednesday.
"This administration, through FEMA, has been working closely with the state throughout the duration of these fires, and we are supporting the firefighting efforts," she said.
"Based on the information the state provided to FEMA through this process, it was determined that there was not a need for additional support at this time as the federal assistance is already being provided to Texas for response activities in the form of the Fire Management Assistance Grants."
By federal law, requests for disaster declarations are reviewed based on whether needs of the state are beyond what state and local governments can handle. But Perry insists a disaster declaration is imperative to his state's ability to battle wildfires. And according to FEMA, it is not.
With Perry's threat to appeal, the fight could be prolonged. But Racusen promised, "We will continue to work closely with the state and local emergency management officials as their efforts to contain these fires continue."

Use your rainy day fund moron! Where were you when US THE UNEMPOLYED IN TEXAS needed a continuation of unemployment benefits? You turned down the federal money!

Bill
You wanted to secede from the United States Bozo, so figure it out without the federal government's help.

	May 4, 2011 06:00 pm at 6:00 pm |

Ya-Hoo Perry, you gave the U.S. your middle finger salute and we give it back to you, full force.  So when are you succeeding from the Union, sooner than later I hope.   All you want is our money, then vilify us,  check it at the door loser.

Spending cuts + smaller government = less to go around. This is what you wanted Ricky. Now be a man, stop whining, and cope with it.

	May 4, 2011 06:01 pm at 6:01 pm | 





Bob Texas
Perry should not get Federal Funds for this state.  He has done nothing but bash the Federal Government and its spending.

	May 4, 2011 06:02 pm at 6:02 pm | 





Dave
Isn't this the same Texas governor who proposed seceding from the union?  Now he wants help.  I wonder if he can spell and knows the definition of hypocrit?

	May 4, 2011 06:06 pm at 6:06 pm | 





Davis Todd
Ha ha ha... losing that government check kinda hurts, huh?

	May 4, 2011 06:07 pm at 6:07 pm |

Obama didn't win Texas and he knows he never will so he refuses to help them.  So many of you idiots think he's great and the other half of us thinkhe is dumb. i can' wait for 2012. Get rid of Obama. He can't see past anything that doesn't go his way.

	May 4, 2011 06:08 pm at 6:08 pm | 





vet in texas
Perry, you've already been re-elected based on your lies to our faithful blind following convservatives, why keep lying.  last week I looked on the FEMA site and saw your lies....all 25 of them.  Stop it please and continue to hid the billions you've already stolen from my beloved state.

	May 4, 2011 06:09 pm at 6:09 pm | 





Pat
I thought Governor Perry thought all federal funds were bad and states should take care of their own business?

	May 4, 2011 06:11 pm at 6:11 pm | 





Beverly - NYC
Rick Perryt he Governor of Texas, wants aid from the federal government, surely this story is an error.   It's this the same governor who vowed to succeed.  After a long day I needed a good laugh.  Maybe the Koch brothers will help you out Rick.
Perfect picture,pouting like a 2year old not used to hearing NO!!

	May 4, 2011 06:11 pm at 6:11 pm | 





peggysue
I live in TX and we have received a lot of help from the Feds to fight the fires. It seems to me help for the victims of the tornados is much greater than any additional help we need to fight fires. Where I live we have gotten a lot of rain and the risk of additional fires is low.

	May 4, 2011 06:11 pm at 6:11 pm | 





Jake
hypocrisy and double standards!!

	May 4, 2011 06:12 pm at 6:12 pm |

C'mon Rick, man up. Sounds like the Feds say you can handle it so handle it you secessionist whiner.
Burned grass, barns and some dead cattle pale in comparison to what's happening in other neighboring states.

	May 4, 2011 06:12 pm at 6:12 pm | 





Neil
I agree with the Obama administration! For months I have listened to Gov. Perry complain about how Texas would be better off if it left the union. Well... now he wants federal help. Let him stew for a time. Don't mess with Texas didn't work so well this time.

	May 4, 2011 06:13 pm at 6:13 pm | 





Republicans Are The American Taliban
"I am dismayed that this administration has denied Texans the much needed assistance they deserve," 
They got exactly what they deserved...

	May 4, 2011 06:14 pm at 6:14 pm | 





rhumba
So, Governor Perry, how you gonna spin this one?  The president's giving you lots of federal help, but you want more, more, more.  Looks like President Obama's been listening to you and doesn't want you to feel like the federal government's stomping on your state's rights.  Too much federal money might make Texans lazy.

	May 4, 2011 06:14 pm at 6:14 pm | 





Jo Jo
How does the saying go, "You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar".  After all the negative comments made against President Obama and his administration, he now expect a handout?  I thought he was against BIG government interference?  Wow, he's fighting for government assistance.  How ironic, laughable and hypocritical.

	May 4, 2011 06:15 pm at 6:15 pm | 





Russ
Hey Rick, maybe you get the point. We don't like Texas. Go ahead and proceed with your withdrawal from the Union. That's what you wanted. Why should you get help for Obama the way you bad mouth the government. Wouldn't taking their money be "more government control" and be socialistic?  You can't have it both ways. You only want their help when it effects you and the hell with everyone else.

	May 4, 2011 06:15 pm at 6:15 pm | 





Ex-GOP Con
Really? There's an irony that a GOP is asking for federal assistance after decrying that government is too big!
Bill White should have been governor. White knew how to govern and make government work. He certainly also would have tried alot harder and lobbied harder to get us the shuttle. Perry...you suck! Pray on that!

	May 4, 2011 06:17 pm at 6:17 pm |

This goofball didn't want federal stimulus funds but now cries wolf about disaster relief.  Hypocrite plain and simple.

AAHHHH . . . . .  POOR PERRY
Is this the same jerk that used the threat of Texas seceding from the Union as part of his campaign for governorship?  Is this the same idiot who did not know that the last state that seceded from the Union caused a civil war that led to 625,000 total dead and 412,000 wounded or permanently maimed?

	May 4, 2011 06:19 pm at 6:19 pm | 





Ken from San Antonio
Mr. Smartypants Perry is getting to sow what he reaped!!
In the past he diverted federal education funding to the general coffers of texas, he has a $9 billion "rainy day fund" which he has refused to use for state emergencies, but 2 years ago he took moeny out to fund his Rick Perry slush fund to invest in pet projects proposed by his campaign donors.
Do I feel sorry for Rickie?  Not one bit.  I do feel sorry for my fellow Texans that we have to tolerate his mis-governorship for another 2 years!

	May 4, 2011 06:19 pm at 6:19 pm | 





Claudia, Houston, Tx
The Texas legislature has appropriated $22 million in general revenue funds as requested by Perry to restore the Governors Mansion, which was previously damaged from fire,  in addition private citizens have contributed  $3.5 million.  Plus, Perry and his family, cooks, maids, etc. are renting a property(mansion) and the State is paying for that.  Perry found the money then, let him find it now or maybe he can get it from the Koch Brothers.  This Governor is a spoiled brat so when things don't go his way his answer is for Texas to sucede and he used that "in your face Mr. President" to decline previous funding which he has now taken.  P.S. There is no loss of life from fires here in Texas.

	May 4, 2011 06:20 pm at 6:20 pm | 





Laverne
Oh Mr. Perry you are again trying to pull a fast one on the people of Texas and America.  You are deliberately missleading your state into believing government help is not being provided to the people when in fact federal help is received when a disaster can't be managed from on a state and local level.  Relax it is not time for re-election yet!

	May 4, 2011 06:20 pm at 6:20 pm | 





D-NICE
So Perry is still begging for that sweet federal money. Wasn't it too long ago that Perry was talking about secesssion. Come on Perry, make up your mind. Do you think you can hack it as your own country or not? Apparently not, the state is already getting federal assistance and still wants more. Obama just showed Perry some bootstraps and told him to get to pulling. Freaking hypocrit.

	May 4, 2011 06:21 pm at 6:21 pm | 





New Age Independant
Obama should be ashamed of playing politics when it comes to disasters. Denying this type of request is nothing more then petty politics, but it has become commonplace in the Democrat quid pro quo politics. If this request came from a Democrat voting state, would there be any doubt of support?

What a hypocrite. Perry hates America (he wants Texas to secede), and he hates big government, and here he is crying that our American government money isn't flowing to he and his state.
Pathetic.

MORE REPUBLICAN HIPOCRISY
Texas Governor Rick Perry is about as hypocritical as they come.  He rant and raged against the economic stimulus package in 2009 and blocked Texas unemployed from receiving unemployment support; while secretly telling Texasâs HHSC and Education Commission to publicly discuss their plans for the stimulus support.
Now this hypocrite knows full well that Alabama is a far poorer state than Texas and by established rules, will get the support they need faster than Texas.  In addition, the cost of the disaster in the southern states (including Alabama) is estimated to be in the $billions; while Texas fire may only top $100-million.  Rick is a hypocrite.

	May 4, 2011 06:44 pm at 6:44 pm | 





GOP = Greed Over People
So, pouting Pompadour Perry is pissed, 'cuz the "socialist" will not use the power of "big gubmint" to give his state money for the fires?
Not now, no way, not ever, said Perry, should the Feds intrude on state's rights.  
Well, you "welfare and drama queen", that includes any state that has 9 billion in state funds for emergencies and you have your hand out for  big Fed bucks for free!
We have 9 billion in the "rainy day" fund Pomp, either keep praying for rain or use money from the fund to reimburse the farmers and ranchers to replace the 500 dead cows and the 100 burned homes.  Of course, if you would not allow 3 billion to be used from the fund to prevent cuts to Medicaid and the closing of 800+ plus nursing homes and tossing the patients, into the street, what is a few head of cattle and 100 homes right?
Remember, this is the "pull yourself up by the bootstraps" state all 9 billion of 'em!
And we should not be asking the United States for foreign aid, remember, we seceded!  Perhaps you can bargain with Mexico for a loan.
But all is not lost, pull up a burnt log, slice off a piece of 200 million dollar barbeque and invite Willie for concert to help raise the 200 million!
You hypocritical hyena, big government is bad until YOU need it, then seems "socialism" is nothing but good!

R.Williams
Gov. Perry spent quite a bit of time telling everyone how Texas didn't need or want Federal assistance in many areas, but now is clamoring for it. So what can a Disaster Declaration provide that the 25 grants which already are paying for 75% of the response can not give?

	May 4, 2011 06:53 pm at 6:53 pm | 





Mike Dallas
I am glad President Obama is dissin' Dallas and the environs!
Perry has been a grade A, number 1 choice a-hole towards this administration, and has been given full throated support by all the right wing "christuns".  Even suggesting to the tea baggers secession is a good thing, of course, who knows what the 15% of our state populace that needs Federal food stamps to survive would do, but you think any of these "christians" care? Nope, that is why they are cutting Medicaid and killing both the poor young and the poor elderly.
Elections do have consequences, so stop whining and deal with it!  You voted for him, I certainly did not!
Of course, Perry could take the fire money out of the political slush fund he claims to use to "bring big bidness" to Texass!
P.S. That secession speech is what cost us a shuttle in Houston, you moron, it is an AMERICAN icon, and the citizens of the United States wanted it to remain in ONE of the UNITED states!

I live in Texas and I am totally embarrassed by Perry.  Everytime he opens his mouth he sticks his foot in it.  He is out for Perry and no one else.  In one breath he doesn't believe in government handouts and the next he has his hands stuck out.  Knowing him he would probably spend the money on something that it wasn't originally intended for.

time for Texas to start the chain of events, succeed from the union and lets fly a new flag over free NON-obama America, tell obamapig to stuff his bacon.

sally
Wait! I thought Gov. Rick Perry said he opposed FEMA and federal aid and the government feeling responsible for the hurts to the citizens. I thought he said that costs too much.He even wants to secede from the US and not be part of it at all. I guess he just changed his mind when his state needed the money.

	May 4, 2011 07:08 pm at 7:08 pm |

Sure thing Perry,.. first you decimate your fire fighting capabilities,.. and now when it comes back to bite you in the arse,.. you expect the other 51 states to bail you out.

Texans don't want or need no money from the Fed.  It was wrong for Perry to ask.  The greatest State in the Union will do it by ourselves like we've done since the lone star first flied.

8 Years of "Trickle Down" economics has only left a dribbling wet spot on working Americans's shoes!
Perhaps, Perry the prick, should tell us all just how that whole "trickle down" thingy is supposed to work?
Or, you could keep declaring a day of "praying for rain", that is ALWAYS so very pro-active.

Hey Rick, why don't ya use some of that money that your state uses from its tax revenue to fight the fires. Wait...You gave it away in Oil Subsidies to the big corporations...How is that $25 Billion Dollar Hole working for you?

I thought Texas is in good shape financially per the last election that he won.  The federal government sholld stay out of state's business is what this governer advocates.  Were you not calling for seccession from the good old USA not very long ago.  The federal government can't just be called on to relieve your financial mess Governer Perry, it has it;s own deficit to worry about, remember you are one of the main ones pointing this out.  The federal government has already given financial assistance on these fires through the fire mgmt assistance grants.  Enough is enough.  I have sympathy for all the homeowners but this is the time for Governer Perry to step up and handle his emergency, it's what he gets paid for.

So now Mr. Perry wants federal funds!  Not that I don't care for the people of Texas, but I find it ironic that the man who rails against Washington is now begging for its support.  Can we say, Ironic!

Typically Confederate hypocrite.  First he talks about leaving the Union and not wanting any federal $. Then he complains about not getting enough.  Perry need to first fund his OWN state for fire-fighters so Texans won't see their homes go up in flame and watch in horror as their livestock or pets dies...if someone doesn't pay their "fee" aka tax.

OK Gov Perry, I get it now.  It is irresponsible for government to be spending money it doesn't have unless it involves your state!?!  If you are given this money that you are "entitiled" to, does that mean that you will promise to refrain from critizing "big wasteful spending" by the US Government?    By the way, are you still considering forming your own little country?  Guess you can do everything yourself until a disaster happens.

As a Texan, I'm embarrassed because of Perry. In one hand he constantly gives the middle finger to Obama and the Federal Govt for assistance (such as education – which now he's firing thens of thousands) and in the other he asks for handouts and blames the Fed Govt. when he doesn't get them... he's a spoiled brat.

	May 4, 2011 08:00 pm at 8:00 pm | 





nintex
I live in Texas, and this is embarrassing.  Perry makes a lot of noise about keeping the federal government out of our business, and then whines when he doesn't get what he said he wouldn't take (although the government has provided money for the fires).   By the way, there are a lot of smart, progressive people in Texas, although you wouldn't know it by the politicians we elect.

	May 4, 2011 08:03 pm at 8:03 pm |

I can't remember California's wild fires ever getting federal disaster relief – even when Barbra Streisand's house was threatened! Poor, poor Texas. Why don't you ask all those oil companies that have been raping your state for the last 100 years to help you out? Remember all those tax breaks you gave them? Time to pony up, cowboys. Besides, no one but texans care about their state. The rest of the country just tries to ignore them.

GonzoinHouston
The irony, or maybe the hypocrisy, is just overwhelming.  The local news did not report about the FMAG's, or I just missed it.   Never mind the partisan aspects of the politics; Perry has a long history of taking federal money for specific areas and using it to prop up the state budget, which Perry deliberately under-funded.

	May 4, 2011 08:32 pm at 8:32 pm |

Well, it's obvious what Perry should do: secede!

Hey, if you don't like it you can always secede!!  Don't you look the FOOL now.  Too bad the good people of Texas have to suffer for your foolishness.  I guess that's what they get for voting you into office again.  Don't know about you, but my daddy taught me not to bite the hand that feeds you!  If you can't handle this as a state, imagine what it would be like as an independent country?  LOL.  Next time, thik before you open your suck.

Thinks2010
It sounds like FEMA's paying the bulk of the firefighting costs.  What more does Perry want?  Texas is a state that regularly experiences large scale wildfires.  As such, I would expect the state government would have made provisions for firefighting and handling post fire issues in it's budget and agencies.  I would think this would be particularly true of Perry's administration given his stated opposition to federal government participation in the affairs of the states, his claims that Texas would be just fine without the federal government, his Texas secessionist talk, and the republican bootstrap philosophy.  I am happy the Obama administration via FEMA is helping out the people of Texas already.  If FEMA has determined the state of Texas has made sufficient preparations and provisions to handle the rest, I don't believe any further assistance or federal interference with the State's system or funding should take place.  In these tough economic times, I'm glad we could help out with funding and that over thirty states have sent firefighters to help, and I'm sorry we can't do it all.  God bless the fine people of Texas and keep them safe.

Now he wants to be part of the USA! You can't have it both ways Gov Perry! You are already getting Federal assistance plus we have to cut spending...right?

If you secede from the Union you can form your own federal government, then declare the country of Texas a disaster area. That way you can bail yourself out. Or, you can cut taxes, since that increases revenue. But, no you can't do that because you don't have an income tax and you're opposed to government spending and that might lead to BIG government.

Beyond their means? Could it because the good Governor has slashed spending to the very agencies he now needs to combat the fires, in order to give the needy millionaires in TX another few dollars for their overpriced mansions? Now he comes to the very Federal government he has accused of being intrusive, and screams they won't help when he fails to meet their criteria? Too bad, Ricky, burn. Next time, don't ask hard-working people in Blue states to make up for your budget shortfalls and lousy planning. You wanted to secede: now you know the cost. Deal with it.

Didn't Perry turn down federal assistance during the recession?  Didn't he say he didn't want any kind of interference from the federal government?  Hasn't he rejected ties to the federal government for some time?  Didn't he threaten some kind of  withdrawal from the union at one time?  He has gotten assistance through FEMA and other grants.  He has gotten as much as many other states such as California get during fires and others during floods.  He wants his cake and eat it too.  He speaks through both sides of his mouth.

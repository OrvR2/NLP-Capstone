Jan. 5, 2009--COLLEGE STATION, Texas--Cleveland landowner Christine Browning did a double take when she got a glimpse of her property tax appraisal last year and saw the amount she soon would owe had nearly tripled.Browning purchased her first 60 acres in 1992 and the land already had been filed as timber exempt. But when she added 47 acres a decade later, the property didn’t carry the same distinction She always intended to have the land re-classified, but she simply hadn’t gotten around to it. And with the additional acreage boosting her yearly bill by just $200, she said, it wasn’t really worth worrying about.That changed last year when she got a notice indicating her upcoming tax bill would be $1,500.“That made me go the very next day. I almost hyperventilated,” Browning said animatedly, recalling how she immediately sought help from a Texas Forest Service forester, who went out to her property and helped her get the status changed. “Honey, when it came back $1,500 that was worth worrying about.”Texas Forest Service hopes to help landowners like Browning with two upcoming timber tax workshops that will focus on significant tax incentives created last year to encourage land conservation.The 2009 East Texas Timber Income and Property Tax Workshops will focus on federal tax laws related to timber and recent changes in the law. The sessions will explain lump-sum timber sale regulations, as well as writing off equipment costs and deducting losses from Hurricane Ike. The first workshop is scheduled for Jan. 27 in Lufkin. The second is scheduled for Jan. 28 in Overton. Both will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.“It really does impact people from across the disciplines from landowners to tax experts to attorneys,” said John Warner, district forester with Texas Forest Service in Conroe. “I’ve seen an array of people at the workshops that benefit and come back year after year because the information they receive from us is timely and comes from the leaders in forestry.”The workshops generally are packed, Warner said. He attributed the high attendance to the speakers’ abilities to relate information to participants from different backgrounds. “They break it down for the novice landowner all the way to the tax expert,” he said.New tax breaks and increased deductions for timber farmers are among the benefits participants will learn about during the upcoming workshops. Couples who file jointly and have a total income under $65,100 — or $32,550 for individuals — now won’t have to pay tax on long-term capital gains earned from timber sales between 2008 and 2010. For corporations, long-term capital gains from timber sales will be subject to a 15 percent tax rate for one year, beginning May 22, 2008 and lasting through May 22, 2009. For timber business, deduction limits ($250,000) almost doubled and additional 50 percent bonus depreciation now is available for new equipment purchased and placed in service during 2008. Electricity producers also will reap rewards from the new legislation. Producers that use biomass as feedstock to produce electricity can earn income tax credit. Qualified biomass fuel producers can earn a temporary tax credit of $1.01 per gallon, according to the 2008 Farm Bill. An additional 50 percent depreciation deduction is available for qualified cellulosic biomass ethanol plant property.What: The 2009 East Texas Timber Income and Property Tax WorkshopsWhen: Jan. 27, 2009: Lufkin Pitser Garrison Civic Center, 601 N.

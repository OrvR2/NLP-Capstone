Dallas, TX (September 5, 2011) – Four Salvation Army mobile feeding units are providing 24/7 assistance to firefighters battling wildfires that are estimated to have torched more than 25,000 acres in Bastrop County, about 30 miles east of Austin, Texas. Since Sunday, 476 homes have been destroyed by the raging wildfires and 5,000 area residents evacuated, as conditions continue to worsen.

	Salvation Army staff and disaster volunteers from Temple, Kerrville, and Austin have been supporting firefighters as they struggle to contain the wildfires. More Salvation Army units are expected to be called to Bastrop County in the coming days to assist in the growing response.

	Another wildfire, in and around Possom Kingdom, only 90 miles West of Fort Worth, is now under control. Salvation Army units from Sherman, Fort Worth, Dallas and McKinney returned home on Sunday, having served since Friday.

	Since the start of the wildfire season, Texas fire crews have responded to a record 20,900 fires that have destroyed more than 1,000 homes and burned 3.6 million acres. The Salvation Army is committed to providing refreshment, relief and counseling both to responders, and those directly affected by the devastating wildfires.

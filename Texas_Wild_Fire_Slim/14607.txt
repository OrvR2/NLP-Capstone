Four Join Astronaut Hall of Fame

			June 7, 2010 · Posted in Video News  
		
NASA Administrator and former astronaut Charles Bolden joined with other well-wishers at the US Astronaut Hall of Fame on Saturday,  June 5, to welcome four new honorees: Guy Bluford, the first African-American to fly in space, on STS-8 in 1993; Ken Bowersox, shuttle Endeavour’s pilot on the first mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope; Frank Culbertson Jr., commander of the first space shuttle night landing at Kennedy in 1993; and Kathy Thornton, a veteran of three shuttle missions and more than 975 hours in space. Hosting the event at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex was Jon Cryer, Emmy Award-winning comedian of TV’s “Two and a Half Men.” The four new inductees bring to 77 the number of those enshrined in the US Astronaut Hall of Fame.

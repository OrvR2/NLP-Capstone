(AP) 
LOS ANGELES – Andy Whitfield, the 39-year-old star of the cable series “Spartacus: Blood and Sand,” has died.
Manager Sam Maydew says Whitfield died Sunday of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Sydney, Australia.
Whitfield’s wife Vashti in a statement called her husband a “beautiful young warrior” who died on a “sunny Sydney morning” in the “arms of his loving wife.”
Whitfield — who was born in Wales and lived in Australia — was a virtual unknown when he was cast as the title hero in “Spartacus,” a hit original series for the Starz network that made waves with its graphic violence and sexuality.
Whitfield was preparing for the second season when he was diagnosed 18 months ago.
In January the network announced that another Australian actor, Liam McIntyre, would take over the role.

Andy Whitfield in 2010 (Alberto E. Rodriguez – Getty Images) Andy Whitfield, a British actor who played the title character on Starz’s “Spartacus,” died Sunday after battling cancer. He was 39.
“On a beautiful sunny Sydney spring morning, surrounded by his family, in the arms of his loving wife, our beautiful young warrior … lost his 18 month battle with lymphoma cancer,” the actor’s wife, Vashti, said in a statement. “He passed peacefully surrounded by love.”
“Thank you to all his fans whose love and support have help carry him to this point. He will be remembered as the inspiring, courageous and gentle man, father and husband he was,” the statement said.
Whitfield had only a few acting credits to his name before he was cast as the lead character in Starz’s “Spartacus: Blood and Sand,” which turned out to be a hit for the cable network. Post TV critic Hank Stuever praised Whitfield’s “sturdy, steely performance” in the show.
The actor was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in May 2010 and was treated in New Zealand. In July of that year at Comic-Con, the actor told Zap2It he was feeling “better than ever” and hoped to return for the show’s second season. But a recurrence of the cancer forced him to leave permanently in September.

“We are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend and colleague,” Starz President and CEO Chris Albrecht said in a statement. “We were fortunate to have worked with Andy in ‘Spartacus’ and came to know that the man who played a champion on-screen was also a champion in his own life.”
“Spartacus” creator Steven DeKnight said in a tweet, “No words to express the depth of such a loss. You will be deeply missed, my brother.”

Andy Whitfield, here, as Spartacus, died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma at the young age of 39.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Andy Whitfield, who played the title role in the hit cable series “Spartacus: Blood and Sand,” has died at age 39, according to representatives and family.
Whitfield died Sunday in Sydney, Australia, 18 months after he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, manager Sam Maydew told the Associated Press.
“On a beautiful sunny Sydney spring morning, surrounded by his family, in the arms of his loving wife, our beautiful young warrior Andy Whitfield lost his 18 month battle with lymphoma cancer,” Whitfield’s wife Vashti said in a statement. “He passed peacefully surrounded by love. Thank you to all his fans whose love and support have help carry him to this point. He will be remembered as the inspiring, courageous and gentle man, father and husband he was.”
Andy Whitfield — who was born in Wales and moved to Australia in 1999 — was a virtual unknown when he was cast as the legendary Thracian slave in “Spartacus,” a role made famous by Kirk Douglas in the 1960 Stanley Kubrick film.
The series proved a breakout hit for the Starz network and made waves with its graphic violence and sexuality.
Whitfield appeared in all 13 episodes of the first season that aired in 2010, and was preparing to shoot the second when he was diagnosed with cancer.
While waiting for Whitfield’s treatment and expected recovery, the network produced a six-part prequel, “Spartacus: Gods of the Arena,” that aired earlier this year with only a brief voiceover from the actor.
But in January after Whitfield’s condition grew worse, the network announced that another Australian actor, Liam McIntyre, would take over the role.
“We are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Andy Whitfield,” Starz President and CEO Chris Albrecht said in a statement Sunday night. “We were fortunate to have worked with Andy in ‘Spartacus’ and came to know that the man who played a champion on-screen was also a champion in his own life.”
Whitfield’s previous credits included appearances on the Australian TV shows “Packed to the Rafters” and “McLeod’s Daughters.”

Excluding the Buffalo Bills first Super Bowl loss where Kelly, Thurman Thomas and a couple of other “players” were a wee bit hungover.Who needs the frat rat childish behavior. It does not build character, it builds resentment. Yes, to answer your question, I was in a frat in college and my one tormenter had an accident after I got in.
Just what we need.  Another prima donna athlete.  The Cowboys finally got rid of T.O., and now it looks like they might have another, but with less  skills and more mouth.  Good job.

http://hottrendsnews.net/hotnews/kelly-rowland-takes-a-chance-on-an-x-factor-hopeful%e2%80%a6-mr-paparazzi/

As each week goes by we’re liking Kelly Rowland more and more; she seems like a genuine person and her opinion is always on the mark.
She also seems to be really interested in scouting out talent, as last night’s show proved.
She singled out Charissie from girlband Twisted and convinced her to audition again by herself after her group received four no’s from the judges. Charissie had actually auditioned and made it to the boot camp stage of the show last year, but Kelly convinced her to give it another shot.
Following the singer’s encouraging words Charissie is now through to the next round of the show. But can imagine how gutted she’ll be if she flounders at the next hurdle again?
Watch her audition here.

12 September 2011 Last updated at 04:13 ET
Andy Whitfield, the British star of US TV drama, Spartacus: Blood and Sand, has died at the age of 39.
Whitfield died on Sunday in Sydney, Australia, 18 months after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, his family and manager said.
His wife, Vashti, described him as “our beautiful young warrior”.
Whitfield was born in Wales and moved to Australia in 1999. Actor Liam McIntyre took over Whitfield’s role in the TV series when he became ill.
“On a beautiful sunny Sydney spring morning, surrounded by his family, in the arms of his loving wife, our beautiful young warrior Andy Whitfield lost his 18-month battle with lymphoma cancer,” his wife said in a statement.
‘Courage and strength’
“He passed peacefully surrounded by love. Thank you to all his fans whose love and support have helped carry him to this point. He will be remembered as the inspiring, courageous and gentle man, father and husband he was.”
Chris Albrecht, president and chief operating officer of US TV network Starz, said he was “deeply saddened” by Whitfield’s loss.
“We were fortunate to have worked with Andy in Spartacus and came to know that the man who played a champion on-screen was also a champion in his own life,” Albrecht said in a statement.
“Andy was an inspiration to all of us as he faced this very personal battle with courage, strength and grace,” he added.
Whitfield played the title role in all 13 episodes of the first series, screened in 2010, and was about to shoot the second series when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Spartacus, which attracted media attention in the US for its graphic scenes of sex and violence, was first seen in the UK on the now defunct Bravo channel before moving to Sky One.
In an interview with the Deadline Hollywood website last year, Whitfield said having cancer had taught him some important lessons.
“After the initial shock – I was a healthy young man and had no idea this could happen – it was frustrating that the first season was ending on such a high note.”
But he added he then found “time to heal, figure things out and spend time with my family. Stay in the now and enjoy every moment.”
Whitfield’s Spartacus co-star Lucy Lawless also paid tribute to the actor in a statement to EW:
“Andy Whitfield left an indelible mark on all of us in the Spartacus family,” she said. “He was a gentle man who never said a bad word about anyone, a gifted photographer, engineer (no really!) and a brilliant actor.
“How lucky we were to have him grace all our lives. Godspeed, Andy!”

Tony Romo On Cowboys Loss To Jets: We Lost Because Of Me

http://hottrendsnews.net/hotnews/tony-romo-on-cowboys-loss-to-jets-we-lost-because-of-me/

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Tony Romo didn’t have to look far to lay the blame for the Dallas Cowboys’ late collapse in a 27-24 season-opening loss to the New York Jets.
He simply needed a mirror.
“We win that football game if I don’t do what I did. It’s hard to swallow,” the Dallas quarterback said Sunday night after his fumble at the New York 3, then his interception to Darrelle Revis led to a bitter loss. “This game really came down to one of two plays, and those plays are ones I gave them the ball.”
The Cowboys led 24-10 just 10 seconds into the fourth quarter and Romo was performing well in his first real game since breaking his left collarbone last season and missing the final 10 weeks of the season. Then, it all fell apart, with former Cowboys kicker Nick Folk winning the game with a 50-yard field goal with 27 seconds remaining.
First came the fumble with Dallas ahead 24-17 and about 9 minutes remaining. Romo scrambled on third down, then headed to the end zone and was hit by Mike DeVito. That jarred loose the ball, and Sione Pouha recovered.
“I was trying to protect the ball and not squeeze it in because it would be a risky throw to try to get it to the end zone,” Romo said.
New York didn’t get any points then, but did tie it on a blocked punt – hardly Romo’s responsibility.
Then came the decisive error.
The Cowboys had a chance for a winning drive with 59 seconds left, but Romo was intercepted on the first play by Darrelle Revis, who returned it 20 yards to Dallas’ 34. Four plays later, Folk kicked the deciding field goal.
“It was a comeback route,” said Romo, who was throwing to Dez Bryant. “The coverage dictated what Dez did and he kept going. It was a dumb decision by me.”
But a brilliant decision in Revis’ eyes.
“As long as I keep playing, people are going to test me,” the All-Pro cornerback said. “They feel confident in their game plan and what they want to do. When the ball comes to my side, I’m not shocked.”
The Jets’ comeback – the Cowboys’ collapse – was somewhat shocking given how Dallas performed for three quarters. And that the Cowboys were 246-0-1 when they had a 14-point lead in the fourth period, according to STATS LLC.
Jason Garrett, in his first game as full-time coach, said such a defeat must not be crushing.
“We played through the success and adversities of football and kept competing,” Garrett said. “We clearly need to play better at the end to win the ballgame.”
The Jets’ win came in the final game of the NFL’s first full Sunday with the commemoration of the 10-year anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks as an emotional backdrop.
New York tied it with 5 minutes left when Isaiah Trufant, promoted from the practice squad Saturday, ran in a blocked punt from 18 yards for a touchdown. Joe McKnight charged up the middle unblocked and got his hands on Mat McBriar’s kick, which bounced right into Trufant’s hands.
It appeared the Cowboys were going to take a two-touchdown lead midway through the fourth quarter when Jason Witten’s 64-yard catch put the ball at the Jets 3. Three plays later, Romo fumbled.
The Jets turned over the ball a few minutes later when a blitzing Danny McCray sacked Mark Sanchez, hitting him from behind and knocking the ball loose. But the Cowboys couldn’t take advantage when they had two penalties and were forced to punt – the play that swung the momentum in the Jets’ favor.
Early in the week, Jets coach Rex Ryan said he felt a responsibility to the New York area to win on opening night, especially with the team honoring the victims of the attacks and their families before the game and at halftime. He also wanted to get the better of his twin brother, Rob, with their father Buddy in the crowd.
Sanchez was 26 of 44 for 335 yards and touchdown tosses to Dustin Keller and Plaxico Burress, who played in a regular-season game for the first time in nearly three years. He last played in 2008 for the Giants before he spent 20 months in prison on a gun charge.
The Jets also played a clean game with no penalties, compared to seven for the Cowboys, who went 5-3 last season when Garrett was the interim head coach.
A few plays after putting a bone-crunching hit on Cowboys defensive back Michael Jenkins while blocking on a 28-yard catch by Santonio Holmes, Burress had a 26-yard catch as he spun into the end zone to make it 24-17 with 11:56 left. The play was reviewed by officials and upheld.
Burress put both arms out with the ball in one hand, bowed and yelled to the crowd in celebration, and then gave the ball to his 4-year-old son Elijah in the stands.
Romo was 23 of 36 for 342 yards and two touchdowns, picking on Antonio Cromartie on both to help give Dallas a 24-10 lead early in the fourth quarter.
Romo threw for a 3-yard touchdown to Bryant on the Cowboys’ opening drive. Miles Austin also outwrestled Cromartie for a 36-yard TD in the third period.
Witten finished with six catches for 110 yards, Austin had five for 90, and Bryant caught three passes for 71 yards.
New York responded after Austin’s score with a 33-yard pass to Jeff Cumberland that sparked a 64-yard drive. Folk capped it with a 34-yard field goal that made it 17-10.
Burress got his first reception with 44 seconds to go in the third quarter, an 18-yarder, but Sanchez’s next pass was intercepted by Sean Lee. The Jets missed several tackles as Lee scurried down the right sideline for 37 yards to the New York 1 as the period ended.
But after an incompletion to Witten, Felix Jones went off left end to make it 24-10.
The game was played before a full MetLife Stadium, with most fans in their seats before the game for an emotionally charged pregame show featuring an a capella version of the “Star Spangled Banner” by Lady Antebellum that had a crowd of nearly 80,000 silently listening, many of the fans saluting, some crying.
Players from both sides held an American flag that blanketed the field while the anthem was sung.
At halftime, the stadium lights were turned off, with dozens gathering at midfield and forming two huge human squares – in honor of the Twin Towers. The squares were made visible by those involved holding up lights, along with three spotlights in the middle of each formation.
Five For Fighting’s John Ondrasik then sat at a piano on the field and performed his song, “Superman (It’s Not Easy),” which became an anthem for many after the attacks with its lyrics about heroes.

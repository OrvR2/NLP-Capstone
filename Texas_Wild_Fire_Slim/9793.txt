Check out the best gadgets from IFA 2011 (below).

If you've ever had the urge to draw on your TV but don't want to ruin it, LG has an LCD made just for you. 

Writes Laptop Mag:
The $2,199 set lets users draw on the screen via a digitizer, and there's also 3D capability and 2D-to-3D conversion. For those who don't need 3D, there's a less-expensive version selling for $1,699 and a 50-inch model for $1,099. [...] Once your computer is connected to the 60-inch monitor via HDMI, you can draw, scribble, and write memos on the display via the two included digitizers. LG includes a generous amount of programs optimized to work with stylus input: Gallery, Family Diary, Photo Editor, Sketchbook, and-of course-the Internet. There's also one-click printing, assuming you have a printer configured and connected.

				I'm a big fan of Windows 7 and the computer operating systems, but whoever is incharge of their phone department should be fired. They need to do something NEW like apple did with the touch. No wonder they're failing so hard along with most every phone maker was before android.

				Today my LG cell phone wasn't working.  In the middle of a call, I could no longer hear the other person. Great, I use the phone for business and now it broke in  the middle of a work day.  I drove to the AT&T store where the rep. attempted to "reset" the phone, whatever that means.  She then stated the phone was stuck on vibrate mode and was broken.  The good news was that it was under warranty.  The rep. then referred to a piece of paper stating I had to go to one of the two other stores to either get my phone fixed or pick up a replacemen­t phone. 
Both stores were 20+ miles away!   I said, are your kidding me, you want me to take two hours off of work to drive 20 miles each way to get my warranty replacemen­t phone?  Her response was, "Or you could just buy another phone."      AT&T Customer Service.  What a racket.

				I was having trouble with my AT&T DSl connection and tech support told me I should buy a $100 2wire modem/wire­less router and that my old modem wasn't working. So I did. For several weeks, I kept getting messages on an AT&T screen that said I couldn't connect and had to reboot the system. So, I did. Over and over and over several times a day. I hate calling AT&T tech support. Then, it stopped. I think the problem was with them and I probably didn't need the new modem/rout­er. What a scam. BTW. The modem is a trapazoid shape with rounded corners and the longer side with the lights has writing on the end facing you that means it should be upright. They have a little U-shaped plastic holder to hold it upright at the front end with the back rounded corner sitting on the shelf. I have never seen anything so stupid. Why didn't they just include some Play Dough to support it? Why didn't they just make the case rectangula­r and wide enough to stand by itself like my external hard drive is. I swear, the geeks who design this stuff are unfamiliar with the words 'user friendly' or 'ergonomic­'. Every time I have to reset the moden, it means pulling it out of the shelf and unplugging the power cord as it and others have no on/off switch. What? Haven't on/off switches been invented yet by these geeks? While they are busy inventing questionab­le, exotic products, they seem oblivious to just getting the basics right. Also, it's hard finding power strips or surge protectors that account for the transforme­r plugs on 12V devices in the size I want. Little things like that.

				Hmm...my router has both an off/button and a reset button; it's a bitty thing that sits on my desk  and was super easy to set up and use--and far less than $100.00 at Best Buy.  Sounds like AT & T was giving you the usual line of BS they give out when they don't have a clue what's wrong.

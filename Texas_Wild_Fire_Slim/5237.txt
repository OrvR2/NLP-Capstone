Someone please tell me why this guy who appears to be a Chinese policeman is wearing a U. S. Army shirt (in China police free girl from bus hijackers)? How does that even coincidentally happen? If you pause it on second 32 of 42 it is perfectly clear. Someone please give me some help on this.

He's an undercover cop.    Who would suspect a guy wearing such a shirt as being a cop?

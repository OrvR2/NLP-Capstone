FacebookPosted: 10:17 pm PDT September 7, 2011Updated: 12:20 am PDT September 8, 2011MENLO PARK, Calif.  -- Most of us watched television helplessly as the country came under attack on September 11th, 2001. But local first responders answering the call of duty went to ground zero in New York City.Now ten years later, many are still suffering from the effects of that rescue effort. A few Bay Area residents have images, sounds and smells of 9/11 seared into their memories unlike the rest of us."You sit down even when you're on the site. When you're done with your shift, at the end of the day and look at it and go 'My God. It's overwhelming,'" reflected Rex Ianson, manager of the Menlo Park search and rescue team."The places we were they were picking up pieces of body parts. Sometimes there would be like a finger or... sometimes there would just be a glob of... of um..." said dog handler for the team Shirley Hammond before trailing off.They worked at the site of the collapsed World Trade Center for two weeks. Ten years later, some of them have health problems."Unfortunately, I ended up with some respiratory illnesses because of it. Shortness of breath," said Menlo Park Fire Department Division Chief Frank Fraone. "I coughed for nine months straight when I returned. And I currently have been on medications for the past ten years.""When I got sick, I would get a sinus infection. I never got that before 9/11. I had sinus infections. I didn't get better for months," Menlo Park Fire Department Chief Harold Schapelhouman said.Schapelhouman said the federal government didn't give first responders the right information about the dangers at ground zero."It's known now that the Environmental Protection Agency essentially falsified on the premise that the American public should not know how bad it was, the health conditions and the air quality conditions at the site," said Schapelhouman.Because of all the toxins and asbestos in the air, tens of thousands of first responders have developed respiratory problems, gastro-intestinal issues, and -- many people argue -- virulent forms of cancer."We lost more than just the 343 firefighters and the other people at that site," said Schapelhouman. "We've lost a whole generation of people who are now in the response community that don't have their health."Last year, Congress passed the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. The bill was named for a New York police officer who died from health problems related to working at the collapsed buildings..It provides $4.3 billion to compensate and treat 9/11 responders.But those with cancer have been denied because federal officials concluded there's not enough evidence to tie cancer to ground zero exposure."Some of these people are not going to be around. And they're not going to be around because of what happened. The things they couldn't see are what got them at the Trade Center," Schapelhouman said.Yet, even among responders with health problems, there remains an unwavering dedication to the job."If they called today, I'd go back in a moment's notice," volunteered Fraone.A reassuring thought for Americans in need.

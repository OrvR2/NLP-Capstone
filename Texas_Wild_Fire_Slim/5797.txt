Police in Maryland are investigating the mysterious disappearance of a school teacher who vanished during a shopping trip Monday evening.
Alice Elizabeth Davis, a 55-year-old English teacher at Parkside High School in Salisbury, was last seen at about 6:30 p.m. on Labor Day. According to her husband, she left their Allen home to go shopping at a Walmart in nearby Fruitland, Md. 
When Davis failed to return home by 8 p.m. her husband contacted police and reported her missing. During a search of the shopping center property, investigators spotted Davis' blue Honda hatchback parked across the street in a Big Lots parking lot.
According to the Wicomico County Sheriff’s Office, the lead agency investigating the case, officers found no signs of a struggle in or around the vehicle. Investigators also reviewed video surveillance cameras at Walmart and Big Lots and found no evidence that Davis was at either store Monday.

When contacted by The Huffington Post this afternoon, Wicomico County Sheriff Mike Lewis declined to go into detail about the current status of the investigation. The sheriff said that a press conference would be held later this evening.
Speaking with The Delmarva Daily Times, Parkside High School Superintendent John Fredericksen said the school district is keeping Davis in their thoughts as law enforcement investigates her whereabouts.
"Mrs. Davis has been an important part of the Parkside High School family since 1983, and is a 1973 graduate of James M. Bennett High School, so we know that many in the community know her and join with us in hoping for her safe return," Fredericksen said.
Davis is described as a white female, 5' 9" tall, 175 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a yellow shirt with images of cats on the front, blue shorts and sandals. Anyone with information is asked to call the Wicomico County Sheriff's Office at 410-548-4891.

				I should add that the reason the store camera don't show here as she was never in the car, the husband dumped her somewhere, drove here car there and then got a ride home/hitch­hiked, cab, bus, etc. Correction 905 in the post below should be 90%. sad how spouses find it better to kill than just divorce.

				905 or so of all homicides are committed by someone the victim knows, most often a relation and the number one perp is the spouse. An hour and a half is a very short time to report. I am sure the police have the husband labeled as a person of interest. Vegas odds even that he did it.

				Maybe if prostituti­on was legalized it would  help prevent so many attacks against women.  I know this sounds bad but it's something that should be considered­.  Brothels (sp) would probably be popping up on every corner.  Of course the govt would want thier 50% as they do  everything else.  I'd vote for this if it was on a ballot.

				i think it should be the law for cameras be posted on street corners near any business area. for the safety of the public. not to mention i know our walmart has a security guard posted rolling rounds in the parking lot day and night all night long. and i live in a small town aint no big cities here. but if you cant have cameras then security guards would be way worth the peoples safety. she probably fell into the hands of some weridos. who knows will anyone ever know. gees people look around you see whats going on for a change it could save someones life.

				Maybe the husband reported her missing in such a short time because all she had to do was get one or two things really quick and normally does this same thing and is back home in 30 minutes. Maybe he did call her, but that isn't in the story. There are a lot of facts that clearly are not in the news feed.  Since we don't have all the informatio­n, we need to stop guessing and just wait for the full story. There is nothing we can do about it right now by making accusing remarks.

				they say they checked cameras the car didnt just drop out of the sky there im sure cameras must have cams in parking area you would think. anyone who was a costomer there had to have seen someone drive it there drop the car and enter another. then exit the place. if thats what happened. another vanish in thin air individual­, what becomes of theres people that there whereabout­s go unknown its happening daily everywhere­. its the strangest thing. is the rapture slowly happening. we will kmow when the end of rapture all graves will be opened with no bodys in coffins. then its over. why cant no one ever get answers of these folks and children with all the people in the world youd think someone would see something or remember something out of gash. or no one wants to get involved. gees i hope they find her safe.

				Unless those outdoor cameras are just for show, all Walmart's have Massive outdoor cams looking out into the parking lots. I have never been to a Walmart that didn't have one. So either the cameras were turned off, fake, or some one is neglecting to look at the footage. I certainly refuse to believe at a place like Walmart, when some one vanishes, "There is nothing to see here."

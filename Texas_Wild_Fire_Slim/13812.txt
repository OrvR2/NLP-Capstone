How to Choose a Mover
Posted by admin on  June 17th, 2011 


Moving can be very exciting. you are about to enter a new chapter in your life. you are looking forward to customizing your new place of residence, but there is a lot of work to sort through along the way. you are going to have to get all of your myriad possessions packed up and transported over a great distance.
Many people choose to take advantage of professional movers. this involves a lot of trust. you put a lot of effort into shopping for all of your items, and choosing unscrupulous movers could undo all of that hard work. Moving companies could destroy your precious belongings or overcharge. There is a lot at stake. whether you need global relocation services for your business or a residential moving company, careful shopping is important.
How does one choose a mover? on the most basic level, it is crucial to compare their available services and price against other companies. It is probably smart to use one that a friend or family member found helpful. if you are using a service that has not been used by friends, check and see if there is feedback on low barrier of entry websites like social networks about the company. if you see lots of negative information, it is not the company for you. you want to get the best range of services at the lowest price from the residential moving company with the best reputation. These three metrics must work in harmony.
You can use the yellow pages and the internet to find movers as well. Referral companies and brokers can also help you choose a mover. Regardless of which of these methods you might choose, be sure to double check the references of the movers. Even brokers might use unlicensed movers. The better Business Bureau should have records if there are consumer complaints. see if they are members of any state, local, or national moving organizations like the American Moving & Storage Association. find out if the movers are licensed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. if they publish their Department of Transportation license number, you can use that to take a closer look at their reputation. Generally, the more of this type of information that a mover feels comfortable telling you, the more reliable they probably are. The company should offer a free moving estimate to compare with others.
The American Moving and Storage Association has a lot of information about reliable movers on their website. Check out their ProMover program; it is a well-known program of movers who have agreed to compliance with rules of fair play set by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Moving is very exciting. However, don’t let your excitement about your new home blind you from making smart consumer choices about moving companies. Corporations in need of global relocation services also need to shop carefully to keep a trim bottom line. you want a fair price from a company that will keep your precious belongings safe. There are moving scams out there. Smart and careful shopping is the best consumer watchdog available. Ask for a free moving estimate and check the reputations of movers. you will be glad that you did.

For many, Sept, 11, 2001, was a test of faith.                                                 But some area religious leaders describe the aftermath of the terrorist attacks 10 years ago as an awakening that led to stronger ties to the church and a better understanding of other faiths.
The Rev. Kip Gilts, pastor of A&M United Methodist Church in College Station, said 9/11 was one of those moments that makes people realize that life and its challenges are bigger than we are.
During those times, he said, he thinks of Psalm 46, which begins, "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble."
"A huge part of faith," Gilts said, "is that it holds us steady and provides some guidance."
Chris Osborne, pastor at Central Baptist Church, said people looked for solace from the church after 9/11.
"I think there was a great fear," he said. "Church is where you come to get the antidote to the bad. You need to know that there is some good to come out of this."
Gilts said the attacks united the religious community in an effort to embrace the diversity of other faiths and prevent terrorists from hiding behind religion.
 "My hope is that 9/11 alerted us to the necessity to understand one another better, to dialogue and to appreciate people of other faith groups," he said. "The only way to defuse some of those stereotypes and caricatures is to be engaged in conversations with others."
Yunus Zeytuncu, a Muslim who teaches at Texas A&M University, said those conversations have led to significant progress over the past 10 years.
"The faith might be different," he said, "but faithful people, when they get together and start talking about how they see things, they have so much in common. We see that we're not just strangers, but maybe we can get along and do things together that relate to the entire community."
Zeytuncu, a volunteer with the Institute for Interfaith Dialog in College Station, said the group was formed in part because of the need for better communication between the faiths.
"One of the services that we provide to the community is getting accurate information from firsthand sources," he said. "We wanted to start that communication and be that information exchange."
The group organizes regular dinners, lunches and events and, in October, will participate in its first Habitat for Humanity project with members of various faiths in an effort to build fellowship among the groups.
The result, he said, has been a better understanding that Islam doesn't promote violence.
"People are doing terrible, terrible things in the name of our faith," Zeytuncu said. "We have to make ourselves available to other people to show them these people they see aren't really representing what we believe in."
Osborne said the Sept. 11 attacks helped people recognize the difference among religions.
"I think there are some distinctions that have to be looked at and have to be addressed and talked about," he said. "I certainly think having that dialogue is valuable."
Gilts said the immediate response to the 9/11 attacks was a "very deep grief."
"It was a tragedy, and there is no silver lining that would make the darkest of that cloud any less devastating," he said. 
But Gilts does note two things that came from the aftermath.
"The American people and the people around the world really responded in such a way that it did provide a wakeup call to appreciate those who are ready to put their lives on the line for the sake of the community," he said.
"And, second of all, it provided a wakeup call that we must not be content being around people who look like us and talk like us. There has to be a hospitality that extends beyond our familiar group."
Sept. 11 services

The NFL issued a $50,000 fine to San Francisco 49ers receiver Braylon Edwards for a DUI incident that happened while he was a member of the New York Jets in 2010. He will not be suspended. 
Although this tweet was not present on Edwards' account by Wednesday morning, ESPN reported that the 28-year-old later shared the following statement about the punishment via Twitter. 
"I guess the good news is out 49er faithfuls, no suspension. I did get fined but I am in agreement and happy to move on." 
Edwards was arrested for drunk driving on Sept. 21, 2010 in New York City at 5:15 a.m. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor driving while intoxicated charge in July. 
The former Michigan Wolverine, who recently signed a one-year deal with the 49ers, again found himself in vehicular trouble  deep into the evening when he was involved in a minor car accident in Detroit earlier this summer.

				Dos anyone who follows the NFL besides me, see into the future say 15 years from now, and see a Braylon Edwards who never lived up to his promise and is now broke and owing tons of back child support? Maybe it's just me but I would put money on it we will be reading something like that in 2026

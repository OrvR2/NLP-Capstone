LOS ANGELES — Coroner's officials found no drugs or alcohol in the system of Russell Armstrong, who appeared with his wife on "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" and killed himself three weeks before the show's second season premiered.
A report on Armstrong's death released Wednesday provided no new details about why the venture capitalist hung himself. He left behind no note, but the report notes that Armstrong had been depressed about financial issues and problems with his estranged wife, Taylor.
There were no signs of foul play, the report states.
Armstrong, 47, made no mention of killing himself on Aug. 12 when he was last seen by his roommate after dinner. Armstrong's body was found Aug. 15 in his bedroom and he had been dead for some time, according to the report.
Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said toxicology tests completely ruled out that Armstrong had been drinking or taken any drugs before he died. Winter said it "takes a long time" for alcohol and other substances to break down once a person dies.
The new season of the Beverly Hills edition of "Real Housewives" premiered Monday. The marital problems between Russell and Taylor Armstrong were expected to be a major plot point before the businessman's suicide, but the show has been re-edited.
Taylor Armstrong did not attend a scene that was aired in the premiere in which the other "Housewives" expressed shock and some guilt about Russell Armstrong's suicide.
Bravo, which airs the "Real Housewives" franchise, has not said how it will use footage of the businessman in future episodes.

				Two separate suicides in two days by a very small firm that is being sued and has lost people a lot of money. Just a little suspicious to me. Someone could have strangled Russell first and then hung him to a rope or they could have held him at gunpoint to get on the rope. I'm just not buying it as a suicide. This could have been done by someone Russell could have been ready to tesify against or a mad client out for revenge.

				I'm in agreement with Heidi, where's the compassion for his family and ALL his children who have  now lost a father?  Perhaps some of you don't care, fine - some of us do.  Keep the insensitiv­e comments to yourselves or have you never heard, "there but for the grace of God go I".

				No one knows what goes through the mind of a person who chooses death over life. I can tell you, however, that when a person commits suicide out of desperatio­n or illness, the last thing on their mind is who they're leaving behind and the consequenc­es of their actions.  Their only goal is to stop the emotional pain.  I had a father and brother who committed suicide and while the pain of their leaving was great, for me at least, the pain that caused them to do such an act was far worse than my own.  And please do not make any insensitiv­e remark to me - although it will be your choice.  Suicide is a very sensitive topic for me and, as you can read, very, very personal.  Thank you.

				who cares about this guy?  many people kill themselves­.  he was no star, he abused his insecure wife and she was divorcing him anyway.  whats the big deal about all of this?  now shes grieving? well, maybe shes grieving over the $50,000 (i think thats the absurd number) birthday party for her 5 year old and instead of living with one of her cast mates, she could be renting an apartment with her daughter as most people would.  she already has a job, so taylor. and cast mates, get over it.  no one cares.

				Yes they do, I watched the birthday episode that showed Taylor and Russell at their daughter's birthday party.  I remember thinking then, Russell looking stressed out, and then he commented that he only made the money, it was Taylor who spent it.  It turned my stomach and I haven't watched it since.

Update September 11, 2011 at 10:45 AM on Riley Road provided by Texas Forest Service.
Location: Montgomery, Waller and Grimes Counties, Texas
Date of Fire Start: Sept. 5, 2011
Cause: Under Investigation
Size: 18,468 acres -acreage has been dropped due to more accurate G.P.S. measurements of the fire perimeter.
Containment: 65 percent – this number is based on the percentage of the fire perimeter that has secure lines around it. It is also a measure of confidence that fire supervisors have on the ability of these lines to hold the fire.
Management: Unified Command (Texas Forest Service, Grimes County, Waller County, Montgomery County, and California Incident Management Team 4).
Fire Status: The Riley Road Fire activity was moderate on Saturday thanks to the significant progress made in line improvements during the Friday night shift. Fire activity did pick up in the afternoon, as the temperatures increased and the relative humidity decreased. Several small spotovers ignited across the lines on Saturday, but were quickly contained by the unified front of air and ground resources. Black Hawk Helicopters, air tankers and volunteer engines doused spotovers as soon as they occurred. Activity along the western edge of the fire was light throughout the day. Overall fire crews had a very successful day. Overnight fire intensity was again reduced due to increasing moisture from the southerly sea breeze allowing night operations to continue make significant progress on line improvement and mop up operations.
Firefighters will continue to improve fire lines today and mop up any hot spots along the fire edge, focusing on the 100 feet into the fire interior. Firefighters will also be fireproofing around existing homes inside of the burned area protect them from any unburned fuels. With westerly winds predicted for the afternoon, the eastern edge of the fire will be the most critical area for firefighters to work. Total Aircraft resources on the fire include: 4 Single Engine Air tankers (SEATS), 4 C-130 air tankers, 4 Black Hawk Helicopters, 1 Type One Helitanker, one DC-10 Air Tanker, 1 Type Two Helicopter, and 1 Type Three Helicopter.
Resources: Total Personnel: 698
Structures Damaged or Destroyed: 23 damaged / 60 destroyed

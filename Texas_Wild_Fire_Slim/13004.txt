Police in Leander, Texas, said they are looking for four teenagers who are suspects in a fire that destroyed 11 homes Monday evening. The four include two boys and two girls, police said.
That fire destroyed homes in the Mason Creek North subdivision.Â  Authorities estimate the damage at $1.4 million, said Connie Watson, spokeswoman for Williamson County.
For nearly 300 days, wildfires have been taking a toll on drought-stricken Texas, scorching communities and creating dangerous conditions.

It always kills me when they do this. I guess we're just left to think cops know what they are doing. Not always the case.

@Banasy-I do not believe I have seen you so upset(trish).
@gung hoe-Drakorex and Buzzkill have been looking for you, I think they want to apologize to you or explain. I spoke with Drako last night.
gung I know you want to find the trolls, I did not understand until Banasy, Philip and Joey explained it. While it is annoying, the name change thing is what hides them. I am constantly jacked and don't know b/c I am not regularly on here.

These are the kind of blogs that let me visit my blog peeps, so hey to banasy, gung ho, s kel, bobcat2u, leeintulsa, & the others whom I haven't made acquaintance with yet! How y'all doin'? Hope police in Leander get the people responsible for setting that fire! It's so dry in Tx. now, you can just look at vegetation wrong & set a blaze! It is getting cooler though, 97 compared to 107!                    Any of y'all feeling autumn in the air? In any case, the people responsible, teens or not, need to face serious charges, reprecussions & punishment! Arson is bad at any time, under current conditions it's liable to burn a whole county, which it has & is doing again, to Bastrop, right now!!

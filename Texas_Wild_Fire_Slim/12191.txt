[ Print | 

 ]



The Best Management Practices (BMP) Implementation Monitoring Program was started in 1991 in order to measure the degree of implementation with BMP guidelines by the forestry community, evaluate the effectiveness of BMPs as applied in the field, and identify any weaknesses in the guidelines.  Randomly chosen, “normal silvicultural” operations are evaluated, with the landowner’s consent, for the presence and functionality of BMPs.   Operations that are selected include both public and private lands.  This cooperative, non-regulatory program is completely voluntary.  The current BMP implementation rate is 91.7%.  Since 1991, the Texas Forest Service has completed six BMP implementation surveys. A History of Forestry BMP Implementation Monitoring in Texas - Results from the past 15 years (1990-2005)Round 1 - Voluntary Compliance with Forestry Best Management Practices in East Texas (1992).(Executive Summary)Round 2 - Voluntary Compliance with Forestry Best Management Practices in East Texas (1996).(Executive Summary)Round 3 - Voluntary Compliance with Forestry Best Management Practices in East Texas (1998).(Executive Summary)Round 4 - Voluntary Compliance with Forestry Best Management Practices in East Texas (2000).(Executive Summary)Round 5 - Voluntary Implementation with Forestry Best Management Practices in East Texas (2002).(Executive Summary)Round 6 - Voluntary Implementation with Forestry Best Management Practices in East Texas (2005).(Executive Summary)Round 7 - Voluntary Implementation with Forestry Best Management Practices in East Texas (2008).(Executive Summary)For any questions or comments regarding past or future BMP Implementation reports please contact the Texas Forest Service’s Best Management Practices Office at (936) 639-8180.

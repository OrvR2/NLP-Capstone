					I'm EIC of a movie/tv/gaming site called Unreality and I'm a movie news editor at JoBlo.com. I'm new to this business, and I think I'm a part of the first generation of journalists to skip print media entirely. When I started out, I had no idea blogging could be a career, but three years out of college and here I am. I love all things media, and I'm honored that other people actually seem to want to hear my thoughts on issues in the industry. It's particularly nice to see gaming moving out of the fringe and into the mainstream, and I'm excited that I get to chronicle the transition and the constant expansion of the industry for Forbes.

Last week I wrote an rather controversial article saying that newfound social network Google Plus was essentially a bust, and I was flooded by responses from fans saying that I had gone about experiencing the site the “wrong way” to be able to make that sort of judgment call. Wait for your friends to show up? Please. Post things privately? How silly! Google Plus is about contribution, and unless you’re putting in the work to be social and interesting, you’ll get nothing out of it, I was told.
I wrote a more reasoned response to the criticism of my initial argument, where I admitted that saying the site was “dead” was perhaps the wrong choice of words, but I maintained my point that for the average user migrating over from Facebook, it was going to be exceptionally hard to get involved in yet another social network, especially one that on the surface, appeared to serve a duplicate purpose to Facebook or Twitter.
But I’m not so set in my ways that I’m unwilling to listen to a chorus of devout converts. This past week I set out to use Google plus the “right” way, to see how exactly the experience would change my opinion of the site. I had a flood of new followers who had circled me after my original critique, and I was posting publicly for the first time, something I was told was an absolute must in order to “be somebody” on the site.
What I’ve found over the past week is that if Facebook is for connecting friends, then Google Plus is for connecting strangers. It sounds weird to say, and it’s actually even weirder in practice at times.
I found it rather funny when people were saying I was using Google Plus “wrong” by only trying to connect with friends and posting items privately the way I would on Facebook. That seems like a perfectly legitimate attempt to use a social network, but the blank chasm that presented itself to me was an indication that the site was a failure for those purposes.
The fact is you could use Google Plus exactly like Facebook if you wanted to, if all your friends were there. But they’re not, and with some rather steep perceived barriers to entry, I can’t see them coming any time soon.
But not necessarily wrong
Rather Google Plus has now moved onto a new purpose, one that I’ve been told its creators didn’t quite envision. It has much more in common with Twitter, where certain accounts of famous thinkers, bloggers, actors and journalists are recommended for you to follow, and if you do so, that blank newsfeed will immediately populate itself with a flood of information. Follow more than 50 or 100 highly active people, and it’s almost unmanageable, and you have to start sorting your feed by differently labeled circles.

Thank you for taking the time to try Google+ again and post your new thoughts. You make very valid points.
Most notably, the fact that this is not a place for people who are not comfortable venturing off into the internet to meet new people and learn new things.
For me, I love to learn and to share and I love discussions (http://tinyurl.com/42tc527). I try to convince people of how enlightening that experience can be if they just step out of the Facebook shell, but they just don’t get it. Farmville and mundane status updates are still the rule of the day.

Wish I had it so I could comment more intelligently, but it does not sound so much like “a more involved version of Twitter” as a re-purposed and more organized version of Blogger. Twogger? Blitter?

Paul is not entirely wrong in his comments but then he is not entirely right either (cue: ‘intelligent’, engaging, thoughtful and polite response from Google+ early adopter).
Google+ is still new. While its entry in the social network world has admittedly raised the bar, expectations and hype and has made it possible for journalists everywhere to leap on the easy ‘love it/hate it’ bandwagon, those who are checking it out are still finding out how to use it.
As Paul has pointed out, for journalists in search of an audience and self-promoters looking to engage and connect, it is a boon. Those looking for their buddies to hang out with will have a harder time, principally because their buddies are not yet there.
Neither of these two reasons are indicative enough yet of the network’s success or failure. The crunch will come as we roll into the run-up to Christmas, business pages are rolled out and businesses take up residence there and begin to promote their presence.
With thousands (hundreds of thousands?) of brands aggressively promoting their wares and driving clients there the network’s true uptake (and eventual use by ‘average Joes’ will soon become apparent and it at that stage that we will see if Google’s take on how we socially use the web, is better than Facebook’s or, at least, good enough to provide a viable, alternative social network platform.

really great article – I just wrote about it (and you) here this morning – http://plusforgoogle.com/2011/08/23/google-some-excitement-please/
good that you gave it a second chance. I was all for it and slowly, the novelty is wearing thin for me.

After finding this post on G+ I took a look at your previous one first. Now after reading this, I can’t help but feel that you’ve developed a serious case of tunnel vision (and you may even admit this).
G+ is not about getting as many followers as possible. G+ is about accommodating ANY member to use a social network however they wish. Some people may have 10 people on there, a few close friends and their family – they can update their family with holiday photos or post privately to close friends.
This idea that you’re a ‘nobody’ unless you have xxx+ followers is ridiculous. Your articles are focusing purely on what it’s like to be a journalist on G+ and not what it’s like to be an every day person on G+.
You cannot initially call G+ dead because it doesn’t cater to journalists and then call G+ slightly dead because you’ve realised it caters more towards journalists than you originally thought.
It also seems that you’ve made the wild assumption of Facebook being the pinnacle of G+ and that improvements in G+ will not attract new members (like your analogy of better drinks and food at a party). Critical mass is a big thing, yes, but when you have the infrastructure on the web that Google has it’s very clear to see why G+ is almost certainly going to innovate in a way that Facebook would find impossible.
I agree with some of your points, but these articles just seem so closed out from the bigger picture.

It’s an interesting though that G+ is for networking and *making* friends while FB is for maintaining your existing circle of friends. I’d venture it’s a vast meet-and-greet for the tech and media elite and will never replace FB. Nor will we want it to.
The target market is enough for G+ to succeed- it merely has to be part of the social media ecosystem, not dominate it.

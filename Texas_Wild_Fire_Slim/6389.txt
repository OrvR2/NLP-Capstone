Billy Chamberlain came to virtually every Giants home game for decades.
Since the construction of AT&T Park, the 43-year old San Francisco resident stood near the gate at 2nd and King streets to chat with the players, coaches and sportswriters. Every game, like clockwork, Chamberlain was there.
But for the past month, Chamberlain hasn't been showing up, and that's got the team worried.
The five-foot-six inch, 170-pound Giants fan is, according to police, disabled and taking medication.
"We're hopeful the police can try to find him," Giants spokeswoman Staci Slaughter told Bay City News. "I think there's a lot of members of the Giants organization who are very concerned about him." 
The San Francisco Chronicle reports:
"Everybody's been worried about him," said manager Bruce Bochy, who chatted with Billy after most games and periodically provided tickets for him. "The fans who wait outside (to see players) have been asking about him."

His absence became conspicuous because Billy was always, always there for the Giants. He'd found a home in front of that parking lot, in more ways than one. A security guard stationed there, Orlando Green, offered him a place to stay whenever he wanted.
Those with any information on Chamberlain's whereabouts should contact SFPD at (415) 558-5508

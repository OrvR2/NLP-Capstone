Pope names Baltimore archbishop to new postAP – Mon, Aug 29, 2011





VATICAN CITY (AP) — The pope has tapped Baltimore's archbishop to take over leadership of the ancient Catholic order that works to protect the rights of Christians in the Holy Land.The Vatican said Monday that Monsignor Edwin O'Brien will replace retiring U.S. Cardinal John Foley as grand master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem.The job has previously carried with it the rank of cardinal, meaning 72-year-old O'Brien might get a red hat when the pope next appoints cardinals. A replacement for O'Brien in Baltimore wasn't announced.

And in other news..........The pope anounced today that he has just completed his newDeath Star, and the rebel alliance will soon be crushed. Soon his Pedo-Priests will wreck havoc with children everywhere.As lightning shot from his #$%$ he screamed, "If you only knewthe power of the dark side".

Catholics, The Pope loves his pedophile priests more than he does your children.
We know this to be TRUE because he has done nothing to get rid of them. 
Rebel, STOP GOING TO CHURCH.

Catholics are all responsible as those that fund and protect child rapists are as guilty as the rapists themselves.

Is this better than the Royal Order of the Raccoons? A bunch of syphilitic old men dressed in silk robes defending the "holy land"? They can barely pull up their over-sized pants. The 'one true church'? You've got to be kidding. A sick joke.

He might enter Jerulselem to a hearty rounds of boos like Jesus did. When Jesus entered Jerulselem the people yelled at him to leave, pelting him with palm leaves and fruit. Jesus pointed his finger at them and screamed; worhip me!!! Listen to me!!! I am your GOD!!! 
When th Romans heard about this they chased Christ down, leaving no stone unturned, they found him hiding in a hole in the ground at the garden of Gethsemenie almost exactly like how our troops found Sadaam Huisain. Jesus was killed too, much like Sadaam.

IEA sees no more releases of emergency oil stocksBy SARAH DiLORENZO - AP Business Writer | AP – 12 hrs ago





PARIS (AP) — The new chief of the International Energy Agency said Wednesday that she didn't foresee any more oil stock releases despite continuing uncertainty in Libya and other parts of the Arab world.The United States and more than two dozen other countries that make up the IEA put 60 million barrels of oil into the market this summer in an effort to drive down skyrocketing oil prices. Supplies were particularly tight because Libyan exports had slowed to a trickle during the uprising against strongman Moammar Gadhafi at the same time that demand was ramping up in the warmer summer months.Maria van der Hoeven, who began her tenure last week, said in an interview Wednesday that the release was a success but there would be no more."What we did with this collective action was adequate, we did it at the right moment, and it met its objectives," she said.Falling prices indicate that it did achieve its goal, at least somewhat.Benchmark oil peaked at nearly $114 in late April, and it is now trading around $90. Brent crude has given up around 13 percent since the beginning of May.While 60 million gallons covers only what the world uses roughly every 16 hours, the release — which was staggered throughout the summer — was credited with at least some of that drop in price. Concerns that the global economy could sink back into recession and thus tank demand has also played a role.It was the largest sale of crude ever from world strategic reserves, and only the third since the IEA was formed in 1974 after the Arab oil embargo. The IEA released oil in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina and in 1990 and 1991 after Iraq invaded Kuwait.Though she doesn't see the need for more strategic releases, Van der Hoeven, who was previously the Dutch finance minister, said that supplies continue to be tight because of unrest in Libya.Europe has been particularly affected, since it mostly relies on the kind of oil found in the North African country, which produced about 1.6 million barrels per day before the uprising that overthrew Gadhafi. That supply has all but dried up."Everything has been affected. We're talking about wells, we're talking about transport, we're talking about ports, we're talking about refining capacity," said Van der Hoeven about Libya's production capacity.The IEA doesn't expect the country to be back up to its pre-conflict production levels until at least 2013, she said, holding out the possibility that the world could have to wait even longer.Still, Van der Hoeven said she thinks the market is "workable" since slow growth is tempering demand.The Paris-based agency recently cut its global oil demand forecast for this year, saying it will be 89.5 million barrels a day on average. That's 60,000 barrels a day fewer than originally predicted.Van der Hoeven replaces Japan's Nobuo Tanaka.

60 million barrels of oil is less than one day's worth of the world's oil consumption.  Do the oil companies think we are stupid enough to believe we are stupid enough to buy into that small of an amount made any difference to the oil price?

The fact is that between 2015 and 2040 the world..The ENTIRE world...will pass peak.   Most of the easy to get at oil will be gone.   Demand will far outstrip supply, and countries like the United States will suffer complete collapse as economies based on driving 40 to 100 miles per day for your job, and shipping in food from 1000 miles away, will fail.   Imagine how stupid we will all look for ignorantly thinking that oil can keep going.

The oil companies need to go.  Period.   We need new innovations to salvage an economy built on arrogance and stupidity.

The only way to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil is to begin the process of converting our vehicles to CNG/propane and mandate all new vehicles come with dual fuel options. We have plenty of CNG and the American hating countries would soon blow away in their own dust bowls.......

Until you ban all individuals or corporations that are not able to take delivery of the product they purchase on the commodities exchange, for all commodities including good and livestock, you will forever have high energy and food prices.

Waving the BS flag here. Big business on Wall Street controls the price of oil (and controls the governments and UN). It's a known fact that Libia only accounted for less than 10% of the worlds oil production, and that the Saudis had already assured the world that they could and would up their production to offset any production losses from Libia. The price spike was driven by speculators and backed by greed. The release of reserve oil was only to allow them to make more money as it was sold on the market at the going price, without having to pay transport fees for bringing it from the middle east. Pure profit at over 100 bucks a barrel. Now they want more money, so they will speculate it up higher. Congress or the IEA do anything about this illegal price fixing and gouging???  Surely you jest, for both are mearly puppets of the string-pullers on Wall Street. Wake-up and smell the coffee people, we are but slaves of the big business rulers of the world.

London's Brent crude is the benchmark for 70% of the World's crude and its $115/barrel.  Unless we replace Oil with CNG / LPG / Ethanol / Electricity and ofcourse conservation,  we cannot stop the price of Oil.  Asia will keep on consuming more and more to feed their big population.

When oil prices are high, oil and government profit. A higher cost for same volume of oil, same for collected taxes. It is same as raising taxes.
The US government (The taxpayers) own the Strategic Oil Reserve. It exists only to protect  American emergencies. If oil is taken from the taxpayers reserve, it needs to be replaced. That schedule is not published anywhere.

Oil is money. It can be sold anywhere on earth like gold. The US provided 30 million barrels of oil in June 2011, administration says to alleviate AMERICAN oil shortage, (even though supply was plentiful). The US does not import a drop of oil from Libya. Closed Libyan oil supply, (if that is so), has no impact on US taxpayer/consumers. Where is the money from that sale of 30 million barrels of US taxpayer owned oil?  News agencies fail to mention it.

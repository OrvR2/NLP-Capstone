SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. — An AWOL Navy corpsman turned himself in Wednesday after leaving a threatening note claiming he planted bombs at a nearby Southern California high school in an incident that prompted administrators to order students out of the building on the first day of classes.
Daniel Morgan, 22, surrendered at Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base at around 1 p.m. Wednesday, Master Sgt. Mark Oliva said.
Morgan was last seen at the base at 5 p.m. Tuesday, Orange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said. When he failed to show up for work Wednesday morning, his barracks were searched and a note was discovered, he said.
Morgan wrote that he had placed explosive devices in and around San Clemente High School, which is located just a few miles from one of the gates to Camp Pendleton, Amormino said.
Soon after the note was found, about 3,200 students and 180 faculty members were told to leave the school's buildings. Students and staff waited on the school's football field – and later in the gymnasium, auditorium and other rooms – as bomb squads searched through buildings and classrooms. After about four hours, everyone was sent home.
"The campus is secure," Amormino said at around noon. "We have every available bomb-sniffing dog in the county here searching room by room."
Later Wednesday, a Marine spokesman said no military-grade explosives were missing from the base, and sheriff's Lt. Roland Chacon said no explosives or suspicious devices were found at the school during a five and a half hour search.
Morgan was being interviewed by military authorities and could face a military charge of unauthorized absence after failing to report to duty, Oliva said.
"It's weird, you don't think someone who's supposed to be protecting our country would put all of our kids in danger," student Megan Lombardy told KCAL-TV.

				When you have part of the country doubting if the President is a Citizen or having Senators saying that they will make him fail no matter what happens to the country.
When you have a Republican party auctioning a gun, to raise money, like the one that killed 6 innocents including a child in AZ,  THAT'S WRONG!!!!!
The religious right uses the Lord as a weapon against another American for political gain
THAT'S WRONG!
When we work to destroy this country to make money for the rich on the backs of the poor.
THAT'S WRONG
We have enough enemies in the world why do we have to destroy America from the inside?

				I am a student at san clemente high school. AIR CONDITONED ROOMS MY ASS! We were alerted at 945 not 845 as it says above and we were evacuated onto the track/fiel­d where we stood in the heat for 3 hours. After that we moved to the stuffy, non-air conditione­d, gym where we were forced to sit until 1 30. What a great day back! Also, we were given no info on what was going on except there was a bomb threat and we were told to stay on the field...ve­ry reassuring­.

				For all of you asking 'why is this news?'  It's news because the perpetrato­r has been identified as someone AWOL from the military who has access to explosive materials, and is still at large for committing what is considered to be two serious crimes... being absent without leave and making terroristi­c threats.  The public might be able to help identify him before this obviously irrational person takes idle threats to the next level... I hope that answers your question.

Let's start a witch hunt!

Having been thouroughl­y trained in psychology via the media's anti-bully­ing campaing, I've already spotted my neighbor, whose flagrant disregard for where his dog poops indicates some latent stress disorders which led me to report him to the BATF, because he is also armed.

But they said they'd have to burn the whole block down, if I was serious.

Fortuneatl­ey, I'm not.

				Think about it.  Is it even wise to put kids in a stadium after a threat with the school.  Technicall­y the stadium might be considered part of the school what a convenient bowl and millions of hiding places to force people into one spot.  (have seen too many conspiracy­/mystery movies and read too many books.  If I were the school/dis­aster preparedne­ss/etc.  I would rethink the placing of an entire school into one place and perhaps divide into 8 different ways of departure so that should a bomb go off only a portion would be in harm's way.  I graduated in the 60's and as a senior prank some kids called in a bomb threat.  We exited every exit and walked away from the school-hug­e property, which gave us distance from the school while things were checked out.  It was the first time and probably the only time that the town had ever had such a thing, so I think we were pretty fortunate to  have all 1500 of us divided.  It is spread out is much better than one mass target.

				Good point.

I've often thought that sports venues are vulnerable to attack. Especially the indoor kind. that seem so popular these days. Put a couple of nerve canisters in the ventilatio­n systems and you've gota  massacre!

And don't think it couldn't happen. There was an incident in Japan where some death cult created Sarin Gas and attacked the Tokyo Subway System.Sho­wed what could happen if Sarin is released into a confined space.

				But, when you think about it, air raid drill were useless. Think of what 2 cities in Japan had gone through in August 1945. Everything was decimated. Nothing stood, 250 thousand + killed. And that was to end World War II. Prior to that, the samme thing happened at Los Alamos, NM. and the Bikini Island's Atoll. The devestatat­ion proved that craling under a desk is a huge waste of time. When it's time to die, regardless of where you are, it will happen.

				Now, now. I think we could use all the tourism we could get. I mean I never want to leave, but then I like the perfect weather and being able to see the ocean from my front door. Still nothing wrong with just visiting, it's not like the town can't use the money the tourists bring, and they dilute the Marines down to a manageable percentage­. You're right though, it's not his home town.

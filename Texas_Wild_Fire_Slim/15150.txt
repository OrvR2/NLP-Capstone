The Best “Dilbert” Collection in the Last Few Years, December 16, 2010

This review is from: I’m Tempted to Stop Acting Randomly: A DilbertÂŽ Book (Paperback)

America’s favorite cubicle-dweller, Dilbert, is back in I’M TEMPTED TO STOP ACTING RANDOMLY, a collection of “Dilbert” comic strips from July 26, 2009-May 2, 2010.  The previous two or three collections of “Dilbert” strips before I’M TEMPTED TO STOP ACTING RANDOMLY have been a bit of a let down.  Comics in general use some of the same jokes over and over.  It’s the nature of the game and in a more narrowly focused strip, such as “Dilbert”, the same jokes will be seen more often because the world of the strip is smaller.  However, the past several “Dilbert” collections have been overly repetitive.  There were no memorable storylines and hardly anything interesting happened to the characters.
I’M TEMPTED TO STOP ACTING RANDOMLY steps outside of the box.  The characters are the same and some of the jokes are the same, but overall things are more fresh and original.  The Pointy-haired Boss hires a foodie to work for the company, Dilbert grows wings, Alice is sent to cultural sensitivity training, Asok looses his soul to the company’s new ombudsman, Dilbert is forced to complete an unfinished project (left by an employee who quit) that ends up turning people into goat-headed hybrids, and Aosk gets a weird disease that causes his nose to grow whenever someone lies at a business meeting which causes him to get a nose transplant from a veterinarian.  There are also a few visits with the Elbonians and Dilbert goes on more dates in this collection than I can remember him being on for years.
However, the best story in the entire collection and, perhaps the best story in the history of Dilbert is when Carol messes up the Pointy-haired Boss’s security clearance and he has to go into hiding. He gets stuck in the ductwork and eventually ends up dying and going to the afterlife. He’s eventually evicted but brings back a demon to be the company’s new ombudsman. It is that demon that steals Aosk’s soul which leads into an entirely other storyline.
Fans of “Dilbert” will want to own I’M TEMPTED TO STOP ACTING RANDOMLY.  It’s not as repetitive as the last few “Dilbert” collections have been and it’s worth owning for the Pointy-haired Boss duct work storyline alone.

Dilbert and friends are as funny as ever in this latest book by Scott Adams. I have enjoyed it thoroughly. All new stuff, no repeats from previous works. Highly recommend.

This review is from: I’m Tempted to Stop Acting Randomly: A DilbertÂŽ Book (Paperback)

Contains the daily Dilbert strips from 7/26/2009 to 5/2/2010. 
Themes include more failed dating attempts by Dilbert, some of Wally’s finest non-work, biting satire about technology trends, evil and outrageous (but mildly plausible) plots by Dogbert, and other classic Dilbert topics. Frankly, this is one of my more favorite time period-based collections.
Oh, and at some point before this book Scott Adams switched his e-mail from @aol to @gmail. Hope that doesn’t rock anyone’s boat.

The Best of Dilbert, October 29, 2008

This review is from: Dilbert 2.0: 20 Years of Dilbert (Hardcover)

Dilbert 2.0 is a wonderful selection of Dilbert comics with annotations by the author, Scott Adams.  I enjoyed both his selections and his comments.  The introduction to the book is well written and interesting – I particularly liked the “pre-history” Dilbert cartoons.  
Best of all, the back of the book has a CD with a collection of all the Dilbert cartoons!  I had no idea that I couldn’t live without a Dilbert CD, but now that I’ve tried it, I can’t!  
I should mention that the book, in a classy slip case, weighs about 9 pounds and is, therefore, a poor candidate for reading in bed – unless your bed happens to have a desk attachment suitable for holding large, heavy books.  Although I was, for my own political reasons, sorry to see that the book was printed in China, I must say that the production values are very high and that the packaging is very attractive.  
All in all, a book you’ll be happy to have on your coffee table with a CD that you’ll be happy to keep by your PC.

Not the collection I was hoping for, December 27, 2008

This review is from: Dilbert 2.0: 20 Years of Dilbert (Hardcover)

While I’ve loved Dilbert for years, I’m generally disappointed in this collection.  While it was modeled after the excellent Far Side and Calvin & Hobbes complete collections, Dilbert 2.0: 20 Years of Dilbert is not a complete dead-tree edition by any means.  Note the description: “Adams personally selected…”
Entire weeks of strips are excluded from the pages, and storylines are often missing strips, making them harder to follow and leaving out punchlines.  The missing strips detract greatly from the collection.
I simply don’t see why Dilbert 2.0 wasn’t done as a two-volume collection with every strip for $150.

Dilbert 2.0, a must for every Dilbert fan!!, February 17, 2009


ByÂ 
Jeez-O-Pete  – 




This review is from: Dilbert 2.0: 20 Years of Dilbert (Hardcover)

Scott Adams has put together an almost ultimate collection of Dilbert for the twentieth anniversary of his workplace cartoon. The set contains a large hardcover book and a DVD. The book contains a history of Scott Adams’ cartooning career from his earliest doodlings to early Dilbert cartoons to current panels. It includes feedback he received from publishers along with some personal notes he received early in his cartooning career. His history is interesting and touching. The stips are laid out logically from beginning to present. Along with the strips, the book contains commentaries detailing why Adams found the subject funny or what inspired him to draw/say what he did. (Adams did a similar take in the book “Seven Years Of Highly Defective People.” It is a good companion to this, so don’t toss it thinking you have the information in Dilbert 2.0.)
Why I say “an almost ultimate collection” is because the *book* does not contain all the published strips. There are entire weeks missing and several of the series are missing strips either making the story incomplete or cutting off part that makes that series funny. Though you’d have to read from beginning to end to notice this, it does detract from a collection that could–and should–have contained all the strips.
What will allow me to toss most of my old paperbacks is the included DVD containing all the strips to present day (“present day” being May 2008). They’re sorted by date and in yearly folders. (A simple searchable database by business subject would have been helpful for quickly finding relevant items, but beggars can’t be choosers.)
This is a good collection for all who like Dilbert and a great gift for any fan. It is well worth the (discounted) price I paid.

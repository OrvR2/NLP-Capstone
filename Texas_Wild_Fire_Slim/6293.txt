By Rachel Metz, Associated Press
SAN FRANCISCO -- Jonathan Kaplan made it easy for consumers to shoot cheesy home movies when he founded the company behind the Flip Video camcorder. Now, he's hoping to popularize something cheesier - and gooier - by starting a chain of grilled cheese restaurants that combine fast food with high tech.
(SCROLL DOWN FOR PHOTOS)
Kaplan's latest creation, The Melt, opens its first location Tuesday in San Francisco's SoMa neighborhood. Plans are in the works for two more restaurants in San Francisco and one in nearby Palo Alto by Thanksgiving. With financial backing from a venture-capital heavyweight, Sequoia Capital, Kaplan hopes to open 25 to 50 restaurants within the next year and about 500 across the country within five years.
No matter how much people like grilled cheese, Kaplan's plan is audacious, considering the state of the economy. Still, he believes building this kind of business makes sense, particularly during a time of uncertainty.
"Economically, it's a good time right now because people want comfort food," he says, seated on a stool at one of the bar-height tables at his bright white-and-orange-hued eatery.
Kaplan was flipping around the idea for The Melt even before the creation of the Flip Video, which the company he co-founded, Pure Digital, began selling in 2007. About 10 years ago, Kaplan says, he started researching grilled cheese to see if it could become the main food attraction for a national chain. As part of his research, he solicited customers' opinions about the sandwich at the giant Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn. He was buoyed by their responses.
Kaplan was convinced a grilled cheese chain could succeed, but there was one big sticking point: How do you make the sandwiches consistent when you have hourly employees - who aren't professional chefs - behind the counter?
Not sure how to solve this problem at the time, he put his plan on the back burner. In the meantime, he started Pure Digital. The company's Flip Video, a simple, low-cost, pocket-sized video camera, paved the way for an entire market. In 2009, Cisco Systems Inc. bought Pure Digital for $590 million as part of an effort to branch out from its core business of making computer networking equipment. Kaplan became general manager of Cisco's consumer products division.
But Kaplan left Cisco in February. Two months later, Cisco discontinued Flip Video and shut down Pure Digital as it gave up in part on its goals for the consumer market. Kaplan decided it was time to give grilled cheese a go.
With a small group of advisers - including chef and restaurateur Michael Mina - Kaplan approached Swedish home appliance maker Electrolux about making a special contraption that would create uniform grilled cheese sandwiches. They came up with a machine that combines two induction burners, a microwave and non-stick pads, which allow the bread to toast while the cheese melts - without squishing the sandwich as a panini press might do.
Not surprisingly, given Kaplan's background, technology also comes into play in the way visitors can order their meals. If you don't want to wait in line, you can order on a smartphone using The Melt's website. After placing an order, you receive a QR code - a cousin to the traditional bar code, but with more data encoded in a smaller space. You bring that to a code reader in the restaurant for scanning, and an employee then gathers up your order.
When The Melt has more locations up and running, customers will be able to choose where to redeem their codes, Kaplan says.
He believes the technology in use at The Melt will improve the customer experience, "rather than technology that is just there for marketing reasons or technology for technology's sake."
Besides the traditional grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup, The Melt's menu, at launch, features such variations as aged Gruyere on white wheat and smoked Gouda on eight-grain bread. Soup options include spicy black bean and creamy wild mushroom. Prices run $3.95 or $5.95 for a cup or bowl of soup, respectively, $5.95 for a sandwich. The restaurant offers soup and sandwich combos for $8.95.
In a sampling of some sandwiches, the cheese was flavorful and gooey, while the bread was somewhat crisp and airy. Soups, meanwhile, tasted rich, but not too thick.
NPD Group restaurant analyst Bonnie Riggs says Kaplan's idea sounds interesting, but he warns that the restaurant industry overall has just gone through "the most prolonged period of weakness we've ever experienced" with eight straight quarters of declining customer traffic.
Kaplan, however, is confident that hungry consumers will catch on to The Melt.
"Grilled cheese makes people happy," he says.
Take a look at some of The Melt's menu items below:

				How about I take my $6-$8 dollars and go to the grocery store instead? I could buy enough to make about 6 grilled cheese sandwiches WITH SOUP and still have a bit of money left. And I bet it would taste better. Yeah this smells of ripe off. But I'm sure there are plenty of people out there willing to pay anyway...

				That's not the point. I cook for myself and my partner very nearly every day. Once in a while, it's nice to eat something that I didn't have to cook. And yes, I'd pay $9 for soup and a grilled cheese sandwich I didn't have to make myself and clean up after. The same applies to any restaurant­, really -- I've rarely eaten anything in any restaurant that I couldn't have made myself at home -- that's just not the point of going out to eat.

				Wow, really? 

I understand the point of eating out (as I am sure most functionin­g adults do). I'm not saying you can't or shouldn't. You are free to eat out everyday if that was your choice. But I was speaking about me, not you.  And for that price, I think I should be getting more than just a grilled cheese sandwich. THAT was MY point - not that it wasn't homemade but that it was overpriced­. There are places that can make a good grilled cheese and not charge you $6 for it. Some places are worth paying the extra money to go out & eat. This, IMO, is not one of them. This is about a gimmick and not about good food. And nothing in this article has convinced me otherwise. Sorry.

				For the same reason anyone ever goes to any restaurant -- for the pleasure of eating something you didn't have to shop for and cook yourself and didn't have to clean up afterward. Dining out isn't always just about the money.

				Sandwich shops that have the ability to toast will just add this.  Togos, Subway, Erik's, etc.  May not be quite the same, but it's an easy add because they already have bread, cheese, and quick toasting or gilling.  And most of these sandwich shops already offer soup.

				Everything is overpriced in San Francisco. It's an expensive city to live in. About the only restaurant I've seen that's held their prices down is the Tennessee Grill on Taravel Street. The food isn't fabulous, but you can eat there relatively cheaply if you're determined not to cook. :)

				So, an average meal there (with a drink) will be about $10-- about what I just paid for lunch at Togo's (and I had meat, and a lot more choices, but I digress...­).   Togo's and its ilk tend to locate in relatively low rent locations. The Melt will be opening soon at Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, one of the priciest addresses in the country.   I assume that is part of their model

I guess that they're assuming much higher volume than competing lunch choices, but their QR code checkout system doesnt sound like the answer-- when was the last time that you ordered take-out food, and had your wait extended not because of food-prep time, but by the wait to check out at the register?  Some benefit to the customer but I dont see how that increases their volume by any huge magnitude of order.

				Actually living near this restaurant­, and loving grilled cheese sandwiches­, I honestly lost interest when I read they're $6 or $9 with soup. Really? I can get a loaf of bread for $1, a pound of real cheddar for $4, and a stick of butter for $1. I'd probably be able to buy 2 loaves, and make about 24  sandwiches for the price of 1. It's nice to have premium options but if the whole menu is premium, how is this going to fly outside of extremely dense metro areas. 500 locations? No. Get 6 Jumbo Jacks or 3 double cheeseburg­ers from every other fast food restaurant­, tell them to hold the beef and you're still coming out ahead. Yeah I sound cheap. I'm a college student, and America will be cheaper than me.

				Oh please, you don't live anywhere near this place. (not to mention the article doesn't give the location)  There is no where in SoMa, or San Francisco for that matter, where you can buy a loaf of bread for a $1, or a pound of good real cheddar for $4. Congrats to you for being frugal but why the BS?

				Ok, this place will open in the Financial District of San Francisco, therefore, I suspect that those office workers will go for this type of place. Also IT./Tech. workers might totally go for this novel idea.  I saw this idea cheese restaurant idea on a food competitio­n reality show last year.  The judges said the idea was not novel enough and was limited in scope.  The guy was kicked off the show after loosing to some contestant­s came up with better themed restaurant­s.

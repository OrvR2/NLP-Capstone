Chicago theatre fans received exciting news Wednesday as Broadway in Chicago announced that the Tony Award-winning, "South Park" creators-penned "The Book of Mormon" musical will launch a new company in Chicago beginning December 2012.
As Playbill reports, the show is slated to play a 12-week Chicago engagement at the Bank of America Theatre in the Loop late next year. The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, reportedly plan to play an active role in the production.
"We plan to be involved every step of the way just as we were on the Broadway production," Parker and Stone said in a statement. "We're incredibly excited about doing everything we can to deliver a great show for the Chicago audience."
As the Chicago Tribune points out, tickets for the Broadway production in New York is perpetually sold out months in advance, with resold (and occasionally counterfeit) tickets often going for at least $500 a pop. In addition to carrying Parker and Stone's much-acclaimed names, Robert Lopez, composer and lyricist responsible for "Avenue Q" among other works, also contributed to the production.
Broadway in Chicago president Lou Razin reports that the production's Windy City stint has been in the works for some time, as the company's patrons have long been nagging his company about when the show would finally arrive in their town, as NBC Chicago reports.
"Producers understand what Chicago is, and the benefit of Chicago to a show, but nothing good like this comes easy," Raizin told the Tribune.
Telling the story of two Mormon missionaries who are sent to a tiny Ugandan village to share their faith, "Mormon" has won nine Tony Awards, among a slew of other honors. Its original Broadway cast recording was the highest-charting Broadway cast album since "Hair" -- over four decades ago.
Individual tickets to the production are not yet on sale, but group tickets are already available. Season subscribers will be able to purchase tickets Sept. 18, while an on-sale date for the general public has not yet been released.

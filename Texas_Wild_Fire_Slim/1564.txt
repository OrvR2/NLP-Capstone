President Obama is Naturally Out of Touch with Black IssuesBy Sevastian WintersPostsWebsiteBy Sevastian Winters | Yahoo! Contributor Network – Mon, Aug 22, 2011






COMMENTARY | Members of the Congressional Black Caucus are fed up with the inattentiveness of President Barack Obama to black issues. Said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md, to CNN's Candy Crowley: "We are totally frustrated, and people need to know that the president feels their pain. Almost every African-American person I spoke to said he needs to fight, and fight harder."


  This isn't the first time the president has come under fire for ignoring black issues. Last week, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., speaking to a group of people in Detroit, took the president to task for ignoring the black community during his recent bus tour. "We don't know why on this trip that ... he's not in any black communities."
  

  Congressman John Conyers, D-Mich., had this to say: "African-Americans are fed up waiting for the president to take forceful action to address the jobs crisis in the black community. We want him to know from this day forward that we've had it. We want him to come out on our side not to watch and wait. We're suffering."


  What did the Black Caucus expect? Obama, despite the color of his skin, is not black. There has been in recent years an inexplicable melding together of the terms "African-American" and "black." One doesn't have to be a sociologist to see that there is a difference between the two.
  

  Being black in America is about a shared and uniquely American heritage, melded together by more than just a commonality of skin tone but rather, regardless of socioeconomic class, or education level, a common struggle for equality in both law and in practice. Truth be told, there has been precious little that is African among American blacks for close to 400 years.


  The son of an educated Kenyan national, the president was raised by white people in a state where people of various ethnic backgrounds have long outnumbered Caucasians; a safe-haven free of many of the sorts of discrimination and struggles faced by black people in mainstream America. His understanding of self, as it relates to his skin tone, is more closely aligned with stories of his African father than the heritage of others who share his skin tone in America, his homeland. He is American, with African influence, making him African-American.


  American blacks can trace their family history through the civil rights era. While most American blacks, contrary to popular misconception, cannot trace their ancestry to slavery, most can still pick up the phone and talk to family members who were shaped by the civil rights era, and the segregation that preceded it.


  Black leaders shouldn't be surprised that President Obama, like other presidents whose heritage and history did not match their own, would ignore their issues. The color of our skin doesn't shape the content of our character, or world view.
  

  I spent my formative years as one of very few white kids in a black neighborhood, where my mother's black boyfriend and his friends called me "Lil White Jive." That doesn't make me black. I lack the requisite skin tone (part, but not all of being black), but that, I dare say, qualifies me as much as the president, to refer to myself as a black man. I never would, and nor should the president. Being black in America is comprised of more than just a skin tone.


  Congressmen, of course the president hasn't been any more attentive to your issues than his predecessors. His skin color didn't make him black, any more than a quality education, and greater opportunity in career advancement made you white. I don't know why you thought it would be any different.

President Obama is Naturally Out of Touch with Black Issues
==============================================
the screeching from the CBC translates as follows:  "our constituents expect more stuff, like WE promised YOU would provide, like WE'VE been telling them that only WASHINGTON can provide-God help us when they figure out we've been playing them for suckers all these years, telling them that they can't succeed on their own

0baMao is as 'black' as he needs to be, depending on the audience in front of him, (as Harry Reid observed) in order to win elections

People truly amaze me, now we are to believe that President Obama is not black.  I would bet he has experienced the same level of discrimination as other African-Americans in this country.  He can not because of the racism that exist in America single out African-Americans and have a special plan because he would be equally critized. He is as much black as he is white and no other president in the history of this country has ever shared that uniqueness.  The evils of racism in America are what is holding back a very intelligent, compassionate, and capable leader from making America a better place.

OMG! I can't believe they are serious about this.

"Congressman John Conyers, D-Mich., had this to say: "African-Americans are fed up waiting for the president to take forceful action to address the jobs crisis in the black community. We want him to know from this day forward that we've had it. We want him to come out on our side not to watch and wait. We're suffering." 

- How about Whites,  The White people do not have an organization to represent them to get what we want. You have a Black Caucus, and the NAACP and you cry race this, and race that at every turn. 

Whites, Indians, Blacks, Jewish, Hispanics, Japanese, and every other race living in America are also FED UP Waiting for the president to "Take Forceful Action?  I was not aware that the Black Caucus was the only people involved in voting him into office, then I guess you got what you deserved and took a lot if innocent bystanders down with you.   It was my understanding that when he entered the office as president that he was "Supposed" to represent everyone regardless of race.

He seems to have a particular favorite color, and it is not white. He allow funding for $105 Million Taxpayer dollars to be sent to Africa less than 2 weeks after threatening to cut Social Security & Veteran Benefits. He allowed funding of $10 Million Taxpayer dollars to go toward the MLK monstrosity that in now sitting in the National Mall instead of being on private land where it belongs. The National Mall is Supposed to be reserved for Presidents and Veterans - MLk was neither.  

He said that he wants to make sure that children get a better education - especially the Black children. For some reason everyone believes that they do not have the same education that white children do, even though we all sit in the same classrooms and read the same books. And with todays technology there is an internet practically everwhere. If not at one child's house then at a friends or at a library. We can't help it if they won't do the work and would rather hang out on a street corner.

You have a Black President that isn't Black enough for you and you still can't be satisfied, what else do you want? To me all that matters if you are black and out of work, and I am white and out of work - we both need a job right? What difference does it make what color someone's skin is? RACE has Nothing At All to Do With This. Stop Playing The RACE CARD!!!!

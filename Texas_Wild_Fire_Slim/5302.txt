Blog Posts by Joe PompeoWe’ll be back shortly …By Joe PompeoMedia ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Joe Pompeo | The Cutline – Thu, Sep 1, 2011(ThinkStock)The Cutline--along with what seems like half the media world this week!--will be on vacation until after Labor Day. If any big news breaks, the blog may be updated, but otherwise, you can expect posting to resume as usual on Tuesday, Sept. 6.
In the meantime, we leave you with some reading to catch up on in between your end-of-summer barbecues and beach trips (warning: much of it is pretty somber fare!), beginning with the following profiles contributed by members of the Upshot blog team as part of the Yahoo! News "9/11 Remembered" series:

Case in point: last summer, when the church produced an entire magazine devoted to blasting Anderson Cooper, and then handed the rag out in front of CNN headquarters.
The church's latest target is the New Yorker, which published a 25,000-word profile by Lawrence Wright of celebrity Scientology defector Paul Haggis back in February. The piece depicted alleged widespread corruption and otherwise bizarre behavior within the institutional hierarchy of the screenwriter's former religion.
Six months later, Scientologists are now milling about outside the Conde Nast building distributing a 51-page parody issue of their in-house magazine, Freedom, called "The New Yorker: What a Load of Balderdash," as well as a three-part DVD series attacking the venerable weekly.
The New York Times reports: "The church goes to surprising lengths in attempting to discredit The New  Yorker and its staff, naming editors, fact-checkers and others who  worked on the Scientology article by name . . . . The church mocks The New Yorker as no better than a supermarket tabloid  and even created a fake New Yorker cover with the headline 'Remnick  Denies Alien Baby Claim,' a dig at the magazine's editor, David Remnick."

As part of the Yahoo! News "9/11 Remembered"  series marking the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, I  profiled Richard Drew, the AP photographer who captured the famous  "Falling Man" shot that became the subject of 2003 Esquire piece by Tom Junod.
Earlier this summer, I accompanied Drew to the spot where he took the  "Falling Man" photo a block from Ground Zero. He retraced his steps  from that day for the first time in 10 years, telling me of his  experience: "I get so caught up in the adrenaline of doing this job. So,  looking  back on it, I think a lot about being able to go home to my  family every  night. Whether I decide to think about it daily or not,  it's always in  the back of my mind."
Here's an excerpt from the piece:
Richard Drew put down  his camera bag and looked up at the colossal  skyscraper that seemed to  be racing toward the clouds at an accelerated  clip.
"I don't like coming down here," he admitted.
"I'm really surprised  how fast this building's gone Read More »The latest in Gawker vs. Fox News: Report claims Bill O’Reilly retaliated against wife’s detective boyfriendBy Joe PompeoMedia ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Joe Pompeo | The Cutline – Tue, Aug 30, 2011(image via Gawker)The war between Gawker and Fox News just got a little uglier.
After months of digging up dirt on Roger Ailes, the chairman and CEO of the top-rated cable news network, Gawker sleuth John Cook has unearthed some potentially damaging dish on Fox News primetime stalwart Bill O'Reilly.
In Cook's latest investigative report, he writes: "Last summer, Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly came to believe that his wife  was romantically involved with another man. Not just any man, but a  police detective in the Long Island community they call home. So  O'Reilly did what any concerned husband would do: He pulled strings to  get the police department's internal affairs unit to investigate one of  their own for messing with the wrong man's lady."
The piece is sourced to "someone who has a longstanding personal relationship with [the detective who was allegedly tapped to probe his fellow officer], and  who heard the account directly from [that detective] himself. The source provided  contemporaneous e-mail traffic to support his account."
All the relevant parties were contacted for comment, including Fox News, which fired back with a vigorous dismissal of Cook's story. (Disclosure: Cook used to be a reporter at Yahoo!, where he worked with the team that produces the blog you are now reading.)

The company had already been forced to shutter its 168-year-old Sunday tabloid, the News of the World, when it was buffetted by damaging disclosures about the illegal practice of breaking into sources' voicemail accounts.
"As is widely known, a review of journalistic standards is under way at News International with [London law firm] Linklaters assisting in the process," a News International spokesman said in a statement provided to The Cutline. "This is part of a process that started a number of weeks ago and is under the ultimate control of the News Corp board through the independent director Viet Dinh, [former New York City schools chancellor] Joel Klein and the Management and Standards Committee."
The years-long phone-hacking scandal exploded in July after it was revealed that journalists at News of the World allegedly tapped into the voicemails of a murdered 13-year-old girl, while also bribing police and committing other transgressions in the pursuit of scoops.

After WikiLeaks pushed a new cache of diplomatic cables into the public domain, the group promptly lashed out at the New York Times for an article published in the paper of record's Tuesday print edition.
The Times piece, "WikiLeaks Leaves Names of Diplomatic Sources in Cables," takes WikiLeaks to task for its largest-yet leak of U.S. diplomatic cables, 134,000 of which have been published on the web in recent days.
Some of the documents, according to the Times' Scott Shane, reveal the names of sources who had spoken to American envoys on a confidential basis--a "shift of tactics that has alarmed American officials," Shane writes. "State Department officials and human rights activists have been  concerned that such diplomatic sources, including activists, journalists  and academics in authoritarian countries, could face reprisals,  including dismissal from their jobs, prosecution or violence."
Shane adds: "Since late 2010, The New York Times and several other news organizations  have had access to more than 250,000 State Department cables originally  obtained by WikiLeaks, citing them in news articles and publishing a  relatively small number of cables deemed newsworthy. But The Times and  other publications that had access to the documents removed the names of  people judged vulnerable to retaliation."

When covering a hurricane live amid the torrential rains and skin-stinging wind, there is one crucial item no TV news crew member should be without: a condom.
A handy latex prophylactic, it turns out, is just the thing for keeping a battery pack dry, as an audio engineer from the Weather Channel learned in the mad media scrum to cover Hurricane Irene this past weekend. The engineer in question was working on the coverage of Mike Seidel, who is profiled in today's New York Times. (You can watch Seidel in action in the video above.)
But aside from stocking up on barrier-style birth control, the extreme-weather beat comes with some key tricks of the trade, as Seidel and his team will attest. A useful list of them follows after the jump below.

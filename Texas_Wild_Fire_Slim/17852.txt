French Man Forced to Pay Ex-Wife a Settlement for Lack of Sex

The payoff in this case: an award of nearly $14,000 to the ex-wife whose needs were apparently not met. It just goes to show that it never hurts to try. 
Under France's civil code, married couples are supposed to live a "shared communal life." A judge has now ruled that this implies that "sexual relations must form part of a marriage."

The woman filed for divorce two years ago, citing lack of bedroom activity as the reason. A judge in Nice, France, agreed with her argument, granting the split and placing the husband solely at fault.
The 47-year-old ex-wife then sued him for not having enough sex over 21 years of marriage. Not surprisingly, her former husband, 51, said it was because of "tiredness and health problems." A judge in the south of France's highest court again sided with the woman in this case.
The judge ruled that "a sexual relationship between husband and wife is the expression of affection they have for each other, and in this case it was absent. By getting married, couples agree to sharing their life and this clearly implies they will have sex with each other." (via Telegraph)

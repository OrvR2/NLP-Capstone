Fresh and Local
JUN
23
2011
Now in its fourth season, the Fredericksburg Farmers Market offers local residents and visitors the opportunity to buy and eat local. Each Thursday in the summer from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. farmers and purveyors of local food products gather at the Kinderhalle at Marktplatz to sell their wares. Each week a local chef is sampling some recipe using local, fresh products, and a local winery offers tastings. Vegetables and fruits vary from week to week. Grass-fed beef and lamb are also available.
The summer Fredericksburg Farmers Market continues through the end of August, but watch for information on a new fall Farmers Market coming to the grounds of the Pioneer Museum on West Main Street.

Maricopa County Republican Committee Issues Resolution Denouncing State Bar prosecution of Andrew Thomas, Lisa Aubuchon and Rachel Alexander



Resolution passed by MCRC EGC September 1, 2011

WHEREAS, former Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas and Sheriff Joe Arpaio have been leaders in the fight to crack down on illegal immigration, taking on activist judges who tried to thwart Proposition 100 (no bail for illegal immigrants who commit serious crimes), and investigating corruption at the county level;

WHEREAS, in a politically motivated move due to its opposition to Arpaio’s and Thomas’s policies, the State Bar of Arizona, which is under the control of liberal attorneys and criminal defense attorneys, is attempting to take the license to practice law from Andrew Thomas, one of his former prosecutors Lisa Aubuchon, and discipline a third former prosecutor, Rachel Alexander;

WHEREAS, even a columnist for the liberal Arizona Republic, Robert Robb, has denounced the Bar’s investigation, writing about the Bar’s investigation, “Many of the alleged ethical violations are grounded in the claim that Thomas acted in bad faith for political retaliation. I doubt the evidence will clearly establish that.”

WHEREAS, the State Bar of Arizona has a history of refusing to take action against those who agree with their political philosophy;

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Maricopa County Republican Executive Guidance Committee that it demand the State Bar drop the baseless and politically motivated investigation into Andrew Thomas, Lisa Aubuchon and Rachel Alexander.

FURTHER, we, the members of the Maricopa County Republican Executive Guidance Committee, commend Andrew Thomas for his efforts as County Attorney combating illegal immigration and corruption;

ADDITIONALLY, we, the members of the Maricopa County Republican Executive Guidance Committee, demand that the State Bar refrain from any future politically motivated investigations of attorneys due to its inherent left wing bias.

Photos from Phoenix City Council candidate Eric Frederick fundraiser



The fundraiser for Eric Frederick went well last night. Eric made it through the runoff election and will face liberal Thelda Williams in the general election this fall. Williams plans for Phoenix? "Expanding financial resources to grow the budget." I am not kidding she really said that. Williams is all about big, liberal government. This is a stark contrast with Eric, who wants to shrink and streamline government. Tired of your high water bill? Tired of the food tax? Then Eric is your candidate. He is running neck and neck with Williams. He received about 35% of the vote in the primary to Williams' 49%, and since the third candidate who received 15% of the vote was conservative like Eric, those votes should go to Eric. Go to ElectFrederick.com to contribute. He needs volunteers on Saturdays. Early ballots go out on Oct. 15, and since most voters will vote early ballot in this election since the choices are so different, it is IMPERATIVE we help Eric NOW.

Senator Russell Pearce and Speaker Andy Tobin hosting 911 event tonight at the Capitol



Dear Patriots: What a day to remember. I woke up the morning of 9-11 in the hospital having suffered a stroke the night before.  I was in bed and as I watched, I shed tears of disbelief and added my prayers for those victims, their families and America.

I wanted to ensure that you were aware of a commemoration ceremony that will take place at the Capitol on Sunday, September 11th at 6:30 p.m.  My self and Speaker Andy Tobin  would like to take time to remember this day and reflect on the significant mark that it left on our nation.  Obviously I know this is late notice for scheduling purposes, but I felt it was appropriate and necessary to extend an invitation to you all, as you are important members of the Capitol family and our citizens.  I work very close with Peter Gadiel of families of 9-11 and have their full support.  We would love to see you there, but understand if it is not possible.

Please feel free to pass along this event information to anyone who may be interested.

With  kind regards,

Senator Russell Pearce, President of the Arizona State Senate.

Cocktail reception at my house for conservative candidate for Phoenix City Council Eric Frederick



Conservative Phoenix City Council candidate Eric Frederick has made it past the runoff in District 1, and will now be facing liberal incumbent Thelda Willams in the general election. He is within striking distance, having received almost 35% of the vote to Williams' 49%. The third candidate's 15% of the vote is now up for grabs. Eric is the conservative choice in the race, and received a great score on the Center for Arizona Policy's candidate questionnaire.

Valley beverage distributor Steve Nickolas launches Healthy Food Project



I'd like to share a really neat project one of my good friends, Steve Nickolas, recently launched, the Healthy Food Project. Steve Nickolas, a 35-year veteran of the beverage and food science industries, started this project in order to provide better food to schoolchildren. 90% of the food we eat currently is processed, and too much of it is being fed to our kids. Steve is working with local Valley schools to see that the food being served contains significant nutritional value. Better diets will reduce the obesity epidemic and the spike in diabetes 2.

Steve has founded and developed multiple beverage companies, and in 1998, became the first bottled water company licensed by all major Hollywood studios, including Sony, Universal, Disney, DreamWorks, Warner Brothers and Marvel Comics. Between 1981 and 1990 he developed bottled water companies globally including in Hawaii, Micronesia, Indonesia, Philippines, Israel, Egypt and Germany as well as several companies in North America.
 

Watch his interview with ABC-15 below.

Is this a new paid consultant website, slamming conservatives and others?



I've been in the social media and blogging business long enough to smell a rat when I see one. A new anonymous political site popped up this year called "Politics Arizona." Most of the posts seem to consist of promoting Jeff Flake and Kirk Adams and bashing conservative Matt Salmon. There is also a keen interest in the Phoenix Mayoral race, the posts appear to be supporting Wes Gullett. I suspect the site is run by a political consultant who is getting paid either as an independent expenditure or directly on those two races - the US Senate race that Flake is in, the CD-6 Congressional race that Salmon is in, and possibly the Mayor's race. The site pretends to look conservative, but what tipped me off were the articles bashing conservative Salmon. Salmon has been endorsed by conservatives like Sheriff Arpaio and Rep. Trent Franks. Nice try consultants! It's unfortunate when a site that purports to be conservative is likely getting paid to bash other conservatives.

How to get your website to the top of google search engine results





One request we frequently get from clients at Right Now Social Media, my consulting company, is how they can appear higher in search engine results for potential customers searching on their products and services. Search engines are looking for very specific criteria when they rank websites. When I first began doing Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for clients, I spent hours reading free website FAQs about SEO, hoping to figure out how to do it myself. I didn't get very far. There were a couple of things the FAQs either left out or did not explain well enough so I wasn't even coming close to getting on Google's radar. Finally, after investing a LOT more time and getting lucky, I discovered the few key things search engines are looking for. When you find out, you will say "duh some of that makes sense." But it is not intuitive and a lot of it came through trial and error. The big SEO companies out there know the secrets are difficult to figure out and so they will charge you an arm and a leg. The cheapest company we found charges $500/mth with a minimum 6-month contract. Most SEO companies that are any good charge upwards of $1000/mth.  If you don't have that kind of money, and can spare a little extra time, buy our secret and do it yourself. The good news is once you have spent 10-20 or more hours setting up the SEO secrets, there is very little ongoing work needed after that (unless the search engines decide to make some radical changes). After spending 10-20 hours implementing the correct kind of SEO for my new Alexander Bankruptcy Law Firm, I was able to move it up to the third (unpaid) result on Google for a typical search potential clients would do, "File Chapter 7 bankruptcy in Arizona." Now I'm able to reel in clients without an ongoing advertising expense. Buy our SEO secrets and you can do the same. There is no additional cost besides the $500, virtually all of the SEO I did for my website cost me nothing. You do not need to be very internet/computer/website savvy to implement most of this SEO, other than access to the HTML on your website.

"I am sincerely honored to endorse Charlie Ellis for Phoenix City Council in District 5. Charlie is solidly prolife, fiscally conservative and supports taxpayers and a smaller government, both locally and nationally. Charlie Ellis is an honest and committed American who deserves our support."

Charlie has also been endorsed by JD Hayworth and Russell Pearce.

Government Destroying Free Markets With Public-Private Partnerships




We are hearing more and more lately about Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) as the ideal way to administer the areas of healthcare, transportation, public buildings, water and the environment. President Obama and other politicians are proudly announcing the launch of new partnerships with the private sector. What are PPPs? They are contracts between government and private entities where both share in providing a good or service to the public, while divvying up assets, risks and profits. The average American city now employs PPPs in 23 out of 65 municipal services. In some countries, the majority of civil infrastructure projects are contracted as PPPs. Sounds good, right, for government to assign more areas to the private sector? In theory it seems like less government. In reality it works out to be government granting monopolies to favored corporations which no longer act like free market entities and are controlled substantially by government.Cash-strapped governments maxed out on taxes and spending have figured out that PPPs are a sneaky way around being forced to cut costs. Government officials deceptively describe PPPs as a way to “overcome budgetary constraints,” using the promise of more private sector involvement to make their junk science ideas of “sustainability” projects more acceptable. PPPs allow governments to continue launching large ambitious expensive projects by using a private entity to put up the initial cost in exchange for guaranteed returns. Unfortunately, government ends up in more debt in the long-term because the private entity no longer acts like a private entity in a PPP.There are a myriad of problems with PPPs. Some or all of the risk is transferred from the private sector to taxpayers, diminishing the incentive for the private entity to perform well. Optimally, the risk should instead be on private financiers who have a direct stake in the outcome. With government guaranteeing payment, there is less motivation for the private entity to cut costs. The private partner has little risk of going under since government will bail it out. Of PPPs that reach the implementation stage, at least 50% end up in renegotiations of the contract due to unexpected circumstances such as less revenue than projected.

Should you file Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy in Arizona?



A common question I hear as a bankruptcy attorney is whether someone considering personal bankruptcy should file under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. Usually, Chapter 7 is more desirable, since it wipes out all of your dischargeable debt; Chapter 13 merely reorganizes your debt into smaller amounts payable over 3-5 years. However, occasionally Chapter 13 is a better deal, and sometimes clients simply do not qualify for a Chapter 7 or do not want to give up an asset they would lose in a Chapter 7.

Chapter 13 can be a better deal if you have a second mortgage on your home. Generally you can keep your house when you file bankruptcy, unless you have more than $150,000 equity in it (the amount varies by state). But if you have a second mortgage, the best you can do is get it reorganized and reduced in a Chapter 13. If you owe $100,000 on a second mortgage, and have $75,000 in dischargeable debt, it is probably better to file Chapter 13. (There are some nuances to this, if you would like to set up a free consultation with us you can contact us at AlexanderBankruptcyLawFirm.com)

There are income caps to filing Chapter 7. In Arizona, you cannot make more than $55,000 per year in order to qualify. There are exceptions to this, and a married couple has a higher threshold.

In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you are permitted to keep one car per adult filing as long as the equity you own in the car does not exceed $5000 (the amount varies by state). You cannot own extra recreational vehicles or toys like a boat. Someone who does not want to give up their car that has over $5000 in equity or extra toys might want to file Chapter 13 instead for that reason. In a Chapter 13, you can keep all your property. 

Alexander Bankruptcy Law Firm provides low cost Chapter 7 and 13 personal bankruptcies. $995 Chapter 7 and $2500 Chapter 13 plus court filing fee. Free consultation with a compassionate attorney who will handle your case personally. Call 24/7, available to meet with you around your schedule.

Latest news for people considering filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy in Arizona



As a bankruptcy attorney, I am seeing a lot of interesting developments going on in the field of bankruptcy, foreclosures, credit and mortgages. 20% of people filing bankruptcy are doing so due to medical debt, an increase from the past, according to credit counselors. Many people do not realize that most medical debt is dischargeable. 

Home foreclosures are incredibly high right now, with almost one-third of home sales due to foreclosure. Last year, only 24% were foreclosures. 

Homeowners Associations are now suing banks to get at delinquent properties faster, not content to wait until the banks foreclose. 

California leads the nation now for bankruptcies per capita.

Brad Zinn lectures on Communism - August 27th, 2011 Sun City Grand Republican Club



Brad Zinn's lecture on communism is one of the best lectures I have ever heard in my life. He is right up there with Newt Gingrich and the leading top conservative speakers (he really should be on the national speaking circuit, we're lucky to have him here locally practically free).
 
  
 
Join us August 27th, 2011 at Sun  City Grand Republican Club, 9:00 am to 11:00 am, at the Hopi  Room in the SCG Chaparral Center, 19781 N. Remington Drive, Surprise,  Arizona
MAP   To those concerned with the direction of our  country,Please pass this invitation along to family,  friends, and other Tea Party, GOP, and church members. The response to  this seminar has been overwhelmingly positive. Here are a couple of recent endorsements: 
 
Mirel wrote:  "Last night I saw Brad Zinn speaking about "Communism, the Deadliest  Disease" at Arizona Mainstream Project. It was the best presentation I ever  heard! Complex, accurate, logical, very well documented. Brad is amazing, he  should talk about communism at Harvard."Mirel survived Romanian communism  and now lives in the U.S.
Brad, Having seen your presentation  at the West Valley Tea Party Patriots, I
would like to give my endorsement of  your presentation, Diagnosis:
Communism, for any American who hasn't seen  it.

Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, many have assumed Communism went  the
way of the Dodo.  Not so, as you have made clear to me during a  most
thorough and informative session, exploring the hallmarks, philosophy,  and
methods of growth used by the Communists and Socialists in  their
subversion.

This is information sorely needed by anyone who  seeks to safeguard the
Constitution and fight for the return of genuine  liberty in the United
States. The additional materials provided by Mr. Zinn  are valuable tools to carry
on the fight, armed with that certain knowledge  which is certain power,
the knowledge of the truth. Michael Bailey, Director of Legislation
Greater Phoenix Tea  Party Patriots
Have you ever been invited to a meeting or  event that you felt you needed to go to but tried to find every reason not to  go?  In October I was invited to the Rio Verde Foothills Tea Party meeting  by leader Ray Wallage. I wanted to go to support my neighboring Tea Party but I  had a long day and I was tired so my instinct was to find an excuse and stay  home. However, guilt took me to the car and up the hill I went. Afterwards as I  left the meeting I thought how happy I was that I had come and listened to Brad  Zinn and his message about the history of Communism and how it affects the very  core of our society today.  Brad’s presentation was so well done that I was  somewhat mesmerized.

I now invite all of you to come and hear this man  who has taken a huge amount of time to organize an incredible amount of  information to share with all of us.Sheila Muehling, Greater Scottsdale Tea Party  Patriots
Just finished up  the best North Valley 912 Project meeting to date. All thanks to Brad Zinn. I  HIGHLY recommend Brad  Zinn's "DIAGNOSIS: COMMUNISM!" seminar. If your AZ area Tea Party/912 Org hasn't  hosted him as of yet -- you not only 'should', you MUST!  Arizona Luke, North Valley 912  ProjectFor those of you who missed the last meeting of the Rio Verde Foothills  Tea Party, Brad Zinn is presenting his educational speech on Communism again as  below. It is so educational, and so relevant to today's political atmosphere in  the US, I cannot emphasize strongly enough how important the information in  Brad's speech is. It clearly shows why our fight will not end with this year's  election or even the election in 2012, but only when the progressives are  removed from both parties. See below for information. 
Ray Wallage, Rio Verde  Foothills Tea PartyI  enthusiastically recommend Brad   Zinn’s “Diagnosis Communism” as primer or refresher for all American  citizens, and students of the Constitution.  Brad’s command and delivery of Dr. Schwartz’ material is brilliant, and  a direct “hit” as it clearly explains what is going on in this  country.  Crystal clarity is just  one of the gifts you’ll give yourself by attending this blockbuster event!  Don’t hesitate! Annie  Hodgkins, Rio Verde Foothills Tea Party 
As a  leader of Peoria South Tea Party Patriots, I had the pleasure of seeing Brad  Zinn and his presentation on Diagnosis: Communism. I found it very informative  and certainly correct with respect to my knowledge of communism. A  close friend of mine, who grew up in the former Soviet Union, attended one of  his programs with me, leaned in at one point, and said they definitely do "eat  their own." She had found the program very much what she experienced while  growing up. I highly recommend this program to everyone. It  has many real world applications today as I noted above. You will learn a  lot.John A. Rosado, Peoria South Tea Party  Patriots
I highly recommend  every U.S. citizen take the opportunity to watch Mr. Brad Zinn’s presentation of  “Diagnosis: Communism”!His  insightful and well-researched analysis of Communism serves as a much needed  reminder that we are seeing Communism already being implemented within U.S.  society and the inherent dangers of this form of government is in direct  opposition to the purpose and reasoning for our Founding Father’s vision for the  role of government in the U.S.Generations of children now have grown up and taken for granted the  individual freedoms and rights granted to us through our U.S. Constitution. Many  of us are guilty of taking these freedoms for granted and have ignored political  policies which have put our country on a direct path toward Communism. Mr.  Zinn’s presentation serves as an ‘awakening’ for us, our children, and our  grandchildren to recognize Communism for what it truly is: erasure of individual  freedoms and rights. Our children need to become aware of how socialism and  Communism will dramatically and negatively impact their lives. Thank God for Mr.  Zinn’s educational message and passion to inform us and remind us that we are  truly engaged in a political battle to protect and sustain the checks and  balances of governmental power which have made our country the greatest nation  on earth.Annette McHugh,  Founder, Tea Party Patriots of  Glendale, AZ 
 Brad Zinn is a lifelong student of Dr. Fred C. Schwarz, one of the  most influential anti-communist writers and speakers of the 20th Century. Brad  began his studies in 1966 and started speaking out in the late 1960's and  throughout the 1970's, winning an award for his efforts.He has now resurrected his educational speeches and brought them up  to date with today's technology to produce a fast moving, information packed,  well documented and researched educational experience on the subject of the true  nature of Marxism. This will be one meeting you will not want to miss, and one  you will long remember.Brad is on the Advisory  Board of AnyStreet.org, as well as Arizona Mainstream Project.org, and you can  see his journalistic efforts on Western Free Press.com. He founded and co-chairs  Verify The Vote, Arizona Elections Task Force. He is a frequent guest on radio  as an expert on communism and vote fraud issues.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Our nation today is faced with a showdown between  the forces of Liberty and the forces of Tyranny. Americans  across the political spectrum have begun to take notice and take action.  Americans instinctively desire freedom and reject totalitarianism. Few, however,  have been schooled in the history of Marxism-Leninism. This is to our detriment.  To combat the ideas, tactics, objectives and goals of communism, we must make an  effort to understand its nature. Only with knowledge can we design effective  programs to defeat the false and deadly promises it makes.Please join us for a crash course  seminar on the true nature of Communism. The seminar is based on the works of  Dr. Fred C. Schwarz. Dr. Schwarz is sadly little known to the majority of  Americans today, but he was a seminal figure in the fight against communism from  the 1950s to the 1990s. His research, writings and influence has been felt  throughout the 20th Century and now his educational research is needed more than  ever.

Dr.  Schwarz genius was his ability to take complex and confusing ideas and break  them down into easily understood concepts. His books have been translated into  dozens of languages and millions of copies have been distributed around the  world. He was highly regarded by Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp, William F. Buckley,  Jr., and many other leaders in the fight for freedom during his  time.

Diagnosis: Communism! is a free 90+ minute educational  seminar that is a must see for ALL Liberty-loving Americans. 

In the  first half you will learn the history of Marxism, the features of Marxism that  make it distinctive, and the organization and goals of communism. You will also  meet the key players in the formation of its deadly philosophy. 

~ Is  Communism dead?
~ Why do so many embrace this vision? 
~ Why isn't  communism a discredited theory? 
~ What is the difference between Communism  and Socialism? 
~ What do they have planned for the United States, and  specifically for you and your family? These questions and more will be  addressed directly.

In the second half you will hear a DETAILED  PLAN for the Tea Parties and other conservative groups to focus on in the  near term and the long term to recapture the momentum and protect Liberty for  the next generation. These ideas are not being discussed by nearly anyone else  on the scene today. The section on vote fraud, and the upcoming Presidential  Primary, is grounded in facts with an eye-opening and shocking  analysis. 
This lecture is being offered free of charge to all interested groups  within a short traveling distance of Phoenix.Study materials will be available after the lecture for a free  will offering.

Goldwater Institute issues legislative report card



Congrats to top scorers Senator Ron Gould and Representative Judy Burges!


Nick DraniasGoldwater Institute Policy ReportAugust 24, 2011Engaged citizens make for good governments. That’s the central idea behind the ninth annual Goldwater Institute Legislative Report Card, which takes into account 375 votes during the first session of Arizona’s fiftieth legislature. The result is a citizen-friendly tool for evaluating legislators’ votes against a simple, important standard: their impact on liberty.Each of the 375 votes taken by the Legislature was classified into one of four categories: education, constitutional government, regulations, and tax and budget. Each bill was then further assessed on its impact, with bills receiving “high impact,” “moderate impact,” and “incremental impact” scores. The results are tallied into percentage scores with letter grades.Both the House of Representatives and the Senate averaged the same scores as last year, with a House average of 53% and a Senate average of 56%. Unlike past report cards, no legislator received an overall score of A or higher. Individual report cards for each of the 90 members were also compiled.Top scorers in the Senate included Ron Gould with 75, Scott Bundgaard with 74; and Andy Biggs, Rick Murphy and Russell Pearce, tied at 73. In the House, top scorers included Judy Burges, with 76; Eddie Farnsworth, with 75; and Jack Harper, with 73.Among the freshman class, nine legislators received an A-, while 12 received an F or F-.The report card also compared citizen-funded candidates and government-funded candidates. As in past years, the data shows no discernable connection between the source of campaign financing and scores received.Read the 2011 Legislative Report Card hereRead the Appendix of bills studied hereClick here to look up your lawmakers' scores

Iran's President has nutty theory about 9-11





Arab News:

The Iranian president said on Sunday the United States used the Sept. 11 attacks as an excuse for launching wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the attacks were a “complicated, designed game” to affect people’s emotions and pave way for the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.

He also said US launched those wars to solve its own economic problems. Ahmadinejad’s remarks appeared on Iranian state TV’s website on Sunday.

...The man lives in a fantasy world of his own creation.

Liberals, Conservatives oppose cut in Social Security taxes





The Hill:

President Obama’s push to extend a payroll tax cut has united a rare combination of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats in opposition.

When Obama first pushed to include the proposal in a tax package in December, House liberals said the tax holiday would threaten the Social Security trust fund, which is maintained through the payroll levy. Now that he wants to extend and deepen the tax cut, a number of House Republicans are making the same argument.

“It is a horrible idea,” said Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. He said it was wrong to diminish the amount Americans pay into Social Security at a time when the program is at risk of insolvency.

...

While the moves add to the deficit, the administration has said the trust fund would not be affected because the money would be shifted from the general fund and because the change is temporary.

...If there is no net increase in the deficit, is seems unlikely the proposal would stimulate the economy anymore than what was cut

Navy wants to replace F-35 with X-47B drone





Strategy Page:

Six months after the U.S. Navy’s first full size combat UAV made its first flight, the U.S. Navy leadership has ordered naval aviation leaders to examine the possibility of reducing orders for the new F-35B and F-35C, and use that money to buy the new X-47B, and similar robotic combat aircraft. That move was probably helped along by DARPA (the Department of Defense’s research organization), which earlier this year decided to explore development of robotic ground support aircraft. This program involves two separate efforts. In one, DARPA will turn F-16s, F-18s and A-10s into unmanned ground support aircraft, to see if they can perform as well as the manned versions. In addition, DARPA will seek designs that improve on the performance of the current MQ-9 Reaper. DARPA wants its experimental aircraft operating within two years. The navy currently plans to buy 680 F-35B and F-35C aircraft, for (on average) $100 million each. A UCAS (Unmanned Combat Aerial System) costs less than half that, and provides most of the same capabilities.
For the last few years, the navy was already hustling to ready its X-47B UCAS, for carrier operations and combat use. Within five years, the navy plans to have the X-47B demonstrating the ability to regularly operate from a carrier, and perform combat (including reconnaissance and surveillance) operations. The new efforts aim to have UCAS aircraft perform ground attack missions as well, something the Predators have been doing for over a decade. The larger Reaper UAV was designed to expand this combat capability, and is being built as quickly as possible to replace F-16s and other bombers in the combat zone.

The X-47B weighs the same as the F-18, and has two internal bays holding two tons of smart bombs. Once it can operate off a carrier, the X-47B will be used for a lot of bombing. Sort of a super-Reaper. The navy has been impressed with the success of the Predator and Reaper. But the Reaper weighs only 4.7 tons. The much larger, 15 ton, X-47B uses a F100-PW-220 engine, which is currently used in the F-16 and F-15.

...The X-47B is an impressive aircraft cobbled together from parts on existing aircraft such as the engines described above.  I think the landing gear came from the F-18.  They are a much heavier lift drone than anything in the existing fleet and have the potential to be much more lethal.  The Navy seems to have a good grasp of the future of naval aviation.  The Air Force will need to catch up.

Turks want Predator drone base for attacks on Kurds





Washington Post:

The Obama administration is considering a request from Turkey to base a fleet of Predator drones on Turkish soil for counterterrorism operations in northern Iraq, a decision that could strengthen a diplomatic alliance but drag the United States deeper into a regional conflict.

The U.S. military has flown the unarmed Predators from Iraqi bases since 2007 and shared the planes’ surveillance video with Turkey as part of a secretive joint crackdown against fighters from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. Unless a new home for the Predators is found, however, the counterterrorism partnership could cease by Dec. 31, when all U.S. forces are scheduled to withdraw from Iraq.

The Obama administration has not yet made a decision on the Turkish request, according to senior U.S. military officials.

Previously undisclosed diplomatic cables show Turkey has become highly dependent on the Predators, U-2 spy aircraft and other U.S. intelligence sources in its conflict with the PKK. The Kurdish group, which is fighting to create an autonomous enclave in Turkey, has launched cross-border attacks from its hideouts in northern Iraq for years. Turkey has responded with airstrikes and artillery attacks but has also sent ground troops into Iraq, further destabilizing an already volatile area.

Turkey’s request to host the Predators on its territory is an unexamined consequence of the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq, which some countries fear could leave a power vacuum in an unstable region. It also underscores how U.S. unmanned aircraft have swiftly become the leading tactical weapon against terrorist groups around the world, as well as a favored instrument of foreign policy.

...There is no material difference between what the Kurds are trying to do to Turkey and what Hamas is trying to do to Israel.  Yet the Turks support the Hamas death cult.  I think they should get no drones as long as they are trying to break the Israel blockade of Gaza.  Their support of Hamas should be considered a deal; killer on getting drones.

9-11 was a crisis liberals wanted to exploit





Kyle Smith:

...

Liberals have never forgiven Bush for letting this crisis go to waste. During the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama said, “A lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country. And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, ‘Go out and shop.’ That wasn’t the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.”

Columnist Thomas Friedman says that on 9/12 Bush should have announced a “Patriot Tax” of $1 per gallon of gas. In The New Yorker last week, George Packer said Bush’s call to continue living our lives was “unreality . . . Wasn’t there anything else? Should Americans enlist in the armed forces, join the foreign service, pay more taxes, do volunteer work, study foreign languages, travel to Muslim countries?” Packer calls Bush’s policies “a malignant persistence,” speaks favorably of a draft and calls for a solution to income inequality and (perhaps most of all) a balm for what he calls liberals’ feelings of being “marginalized, misrepresented, ridiculed, scapegoated and worst of all, ignored.”

In other words, liberals desire from 9/11 what they always desire: raising taxes. More citizens joyously marching off to serve the state. Spreading the wealth. Hitting energy companies. And the fuzzy internationalism that hustles to confront terrorist fanatics with the dewy undergraduate’s weapons of understanding and compassion — via vacations in Damascus and Berlitz lessons. As for joining the armed forces, Packer must have noticed while he was in Iraq that many Americans did exactly that, and not a few of them cited Bush as an inspiration.

...And that is only when they were being honest.  They also wanted to make it difficult to intercept enemy communications about future attacks and make it more difficult to trace their funding.  They wanted to make it more difficult to trace enemy cell phones, especially if the calls were routed through the US.  It is hard to have any respect for liberalism as a political philosophy after the last 10 years.

Obama, Democrat agenda getting in the way of growth





Douglas Holtz-Eakin:

The weak underbelly of President Obama’s economic philosophy has been apparent for quite some time now. When faced with a choice between a social agenda and economic growth, choose ObamaCare. 

When given the option of unions or economic growth, sit on trade agreements and empower the National Labor Relations Board. 

Espouse the need to soak the rich and attack successful corporations – even if your own party blanches at raising taxes on American small business. 

Let the green agenda at the Environmental Protection Agency undercut growth imperatives.

In short, make the wrong call on policy tradeoffs consistently. But when the chickens come home to roost – years of substandard growth and chronic high unemployment – argue that what is really needed is a “jobs bill” or “American Jobs Act”. As if economic growth was a government program.
For all these reasons, I did not expect the president's speech Thursday evening to be a policy home run. After all, the specifics – nearly all of which were leaked in advance – were warmed-over retreads from previous “jobs” speeches. 

Of the initiatives:

• Temporary payroll tax reduction, plus an extension to new businesses
• A new hires tax break
• Extended unemployment insurance with a new training for the long-term unemployed
• Extending the expensing of small business expensing
• Supposed “quick acting” infrastructure spending, especially in schools
• Checks to states to hold on to favored employees

Only the notion that it would be “paid for” was held back from the media and saved for the speech itself. Of course that is just another promise, the president made it a problem for the so-called “super committee” to tackle. No big surprise there. 

The president has ducked entitlement reform and believes that government spending is growth, so there was no chance of spending offsets. That means that to provide the offsets would mean he had to come clean with the fact that this is just another tax and spend effort.

...This is a pretty good summary of everything that is wrong with Obama policies and why they have not worked.  It is one Republican candidates might want to post on their to do list of what not to do.  It also exposes the fundamentally laziness of Obama.  Give someone else the tough job of finding spending cuts and have them take responsibility for the anger of the losers in the bargain.

We have a guy demanding that Congress pass a bill he has not written and trade agreements he has not submitted.  What we have is political posturing by an incompetent "leader."

Iraqis have misgivings about US departure





NY Times:

Sheik Kamal Maamouri, the leader of one of the largest Shiite-dominated tribes in Iraq, used to call the United States troops here occupiers, demanding that they withdraw because he said they killed and imprisoned innocent members of his tribe.

But now he is not so sure he wants the Americans to go, at least not yet. Like many others across Iraq, he felt conflicted, and a bit frightened, after it was revealed last week that the United States may keep 3,000 to 4,000 troops in Iraq next year.

“The political changes that have occurred here and the security problems have led a lot of Iraqis, including me, to change our minds about the withdrawal of U.S. forces,” Mr. Maamouri said. That was a view that few Shiites, empowered by the fall of Saddam Hussein’s Sunni government, would ever have spoken — when it seemed the United States was never going to go.

“They bring a balance to Iraqi society,” he said.

...There is much more.

The Americans are seen as fair arbiters between factions.  There is still a lack of trust about the current government and probably with good reason.  Some of the Iraqis have to same concern I do about the size of the reduced US presence.  They are too small to be an effective fighting force.  Keeping a larger reaction force in Kuwait maybe one answer and they would probably cause Iran to think twice about an invasion.

Christian ministers a factor in 2012 election





LA Times:

For most of his two decades as a preacher, Iowa pastor Mike Demastus eschewed partisanship, telling colleagues and congregants that "religion and politics don't mix."

But there he was last month in Ames, making his way across the festive grounds of the Republican presidential straw poll, mingling with political operatives and candidates as he spoke openly about his preference for Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota.

He wasn't alone. The straw poll drew a slew of previously apolitical Iowa pastors — a constituency increasingly heeding a call to speak out on politics.

"There is a concerted assault on everything that we consider sacred — and we pastors need to move to the forefront of the battle," said Demastus, wearing a T-shirt and shorts for the Saturday event.

Demastus is part of a growing movement of evangelical pastors who are jumping into the electoral fray as never before, preaching political engagement from the pulpit as they mobilize for the 2012 election.

This new activism has substantial muscle behind it: a cadre of experienced Christian organizers and some of the conservative movement's most generous donors, who are setting up technologically sophisticated operations to reach pastors and their congregations in battleground states.

The passion for politics stems from a collision of historic forces, including heightened local organizing around the issues of abortion and gay marriage and a view of the country's debt as a moral crisis that violates biblical instruction. Another major factor: Both Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Bachmann, contenders for the GOP nomination, are openly appealing to evangelical Christian voters as they blast President Obama's leadership.

Both Republican and Democratic strategists say that pastors have already helped unleash an army of voters to shape the GOP primary contests in Iowa and South Carolina, two states with large numbers of conservative Christians. They are making plans to do the same in states that are even more important to next year's general election. Those include Ohio, Florida, Iowa, Virginia and Colorado, where evangelical voters make up about a quarter of the electorate and their participation could greatly aid Republicans.

"The Christian activist right is the largest, best-organized and, I believe, the most powerful force in American politics today," said Rob Stein, a Democratic strategist who recently provided briefings on the constituency to wealthy donors on the left. "No other political group comes even close."

...

But the current awakening is different. It springs from the grass roots — small and independent churches — and is fueled by emails and YouTube videos. And it is driven less by personality than by the biblical teaching to be the "salt" and "light" of society — in other words, to have a beneficial influence on the world.

"This is the congregational version of the 'tea party,'" says Richard Land, president of the conservative Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission. "Pastors who in the past would dodge my calls are calling me saying, 'How can we be involved?' "

...There is more.

This is not a Democrat Party movement where candidates are invited to speak in mostly black churches.  These guys are discussing the issues with their members and making their positions known.  It is a movement that candidates like Perry can probably tap into for support in the primary and in the general election.  When paired with the Tea Party it can be a very dynamic force.

The Tea Party audition this week





Fort Worth Star-Telegram:

Republican presidential candidates will audition for the support of one of the nation's most formidable political movements - the Tea Party - when they meet on Monday in a nationally televised debate that is also expected to intensify differences between front running Texas Gov. Rick Perry and chief rival Mitt Romney.

Co-hosted by CNN and the Tea Party Express, the two-hour event in Tampa, Florida, will focus heavily on economic themes and other issues championed by conservative voters, said Sal Russo, co-founder of the conservative group. Many of the questions that will be thrown at the eight candidates evolved from concerns raised by local organizations that comprise the Tea Party movement, Russo said.

Perry, the Republican front-runner, made his inaugural appearance in a national debate last week in Simi Valley, California, and will be looking to strengthen his lead in the polls. The race is shaping up as a two-way scramble between Perry and Romney, the former frontrunner who is now number two in the polls, but experts say it is far too early to reach conclusions before voters begin making decisions in state caucuses and primaries early next year.

Rallying behind demands for less government and lower taxes, Tea Party activists began emerging as a conservative force more than two years ago and have shaped the outcome in a host of state and federal races. Tea Party voters contributed to an avalanche of GOP victories in 2010, enabling Republicans to regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives and broaden their power in Texas and other states.

As Texas' longest serving governor, and now as a presidential candidate, Perry has espoused an anti-Washington message that embraces many of the themes that helped give rise to the Tea Party. But Romney has also stressed that he supports "a lot of what the Tea Party believes in," including smaller government, less taxes and more jobs.

Other candidates will use the debate to try to wrest the spotlight away from the two dominant contenders. Several candidates, including Texas Congressman Ron Paul and Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, also have support among Tea Party voters and will be competing to strengthen their appeal within the grassroots movement.

But at this early stage of the race, say Russo and other Tea Party leaders, no candidate has a lock on the Tea Party vote. "It's a wide open field," said Russo, a Sacramento consultant. "It's a two-man race right at the moment but I think things can change."

Adrian Murray of Fort Worth, the founder of a new organization called Common Ground America, said the number one qualification Tea Party activists want in a candidate is the ability to beat President Obama. Members of the Tea Party and related groups are "sick to death" of Obama's policies, said Murray, and have been accelerating their activities in recent months to prepare for next year's election.

...Perry has injected the continuing viability of Social Security into the race.  Romney has taken the Democrat side of that argument.  That should make for an interesting confrontation this week.  Perry probably has a better sense of his audience when it comes to the Tea Party.

Perry tough talk win supports in California





San Francisco chronicle/Houston Chronicle:

Texas Gov. Rick Perry attracted new supporters during his first presidential campaign road trip through California with the provocative talk that enrages his opponents, such as his description of Social Security as a Ponzi scheme.

Perry’s blunt language on Social Security is “absolutely part of his appeal,” Floyd Kvamme, a venture capitalist and former adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said Friday outside an East Palo Alto fundraiser. “It’s plain-spokenness. It’s his realism. The fact of the matter is … it’s broken.”

Kvamme echoed the view of many Republicans interviewed during Perry’s three-day visit to California this week. Stops included Wednesday’s GOP debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, six fundraisers – including the one Friday at the Four Seasons Hotel in East Palo Alto – and a handful of public events.

Perry is connecting with a growing number of Republicans because of his uncompromising rhetoric and his back-slapping, guy-who-married “the first girl I dated” persona. The man who has presided over 234 executions as governor signs campaign placards with a small heart above “Rick.”

Supporters love how Perry refused to back down at Wednesday’s debate when confronted with his “Ponzi scheme” description, which he first used in his 2010 book, “Fed Up.” After addressing the East Palo Alto fundraiser, where 150 business leaders paid between $1,000 and $5,000 to be photographed with him, Perry remained steadfast, telling The Chronicle that while people already receiving Social Security shouldn’t worry about their benefits, Americans in their 20s should.

“Why are we trying to kid our kids, and say, keep paying into this thing, it’s going to work out all right for you,” Perry said Friday. “It’s not. It is broken. It’s not going to be there for them. We’re trying to be political gamesmen. Be leaders. Leaders stand up and say we got a broken system, here’s how we fix it.”

Unlike the more tightly scripted GOP candidate Mitt Romney, who has done few retail political events during his California fundraising trips, supporters see in Perry a personable straight-talker, unencumbered by political niceties.

As Romney-backer-turned-Perry supporter John Warner, a retired Orange County surf clothing CEO said, Romney’s “campaign seems too nervous about everything.”

Perry’s approach seems to be working: He’s drawing big crowds and big donations – $500,000 at a single Orange County fundraiser – in California.

And polls show his support is solid: A USC/Dornsife Poll of California GOP voters taken days after Perry entered the race in August and released this week found him tied with Romney at 22 percent. Nationwide, Perry has 29 percent of the support compared with 18 percent for Romney, according a Real Clear Politics average of major polls.

Few of Perry’s supporters seem concerned that his characterization of Social Security is inaccurate. A Ponzi scheme is a crime, a financial swindle where the swindlers aren’t obligated to pay benefits and the participants don’t know the stakes.

Social Security is a form of social insurance. The benefits aren’t expected to run out until 2037, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Numerous independent fact-checkers, including the nonpartisan Politifact, have called Perry’s statement false.

“Some inflammatory rhetoric – sometimes it proves your point,” Orange County Supervisor Shawn Nelson said Thursday in introducing Perry at an event in Corona del Mar. “When an organization promises to give away more than what we mathematically know it takes in, what do you call it?”

While Perry’s bluntness may resonate with grassroots activists, top Republicans are warning that it may have political repercussions. This week, Perry’s former political adviser, Karl Rove, called his Ponzi scheme description “toxic,” and former Vice President Dick Cheney said he doesn’t “believe it is a Ponzi scheme.”

...I think Perry's fearless rhetoric can put the Democrats on teh defensive about their failure to make the program actuarialy sound.  They may attack him, but they will get a blistering counter attack that will probably surprise them.  Perry is not a threat to current beneficiaries and is raising the point that we are being unfair to young people who are paying into the system.  

He is right about that regardless of how partisan left wing groups like Politifacts try to skew it.  To describe this group as non partisan is misleading.  They are mainly a left wing group trying to cover their political slant with a veneer of non-partisanship.  Rove reflects the cautiousness of a political consultant in dealing with the issue.

Perry maybe exaggerating to make a point, but it is a fair point that voters understand.

South Carolina voters agree with Perry description of Social Security





MSNBC:

South Carolina retirees and Social Security recipients who support the Tea Party seem to agree with Texas Gov. Rick Perry that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.

A number of participants at a Tea Party Rally today in Bluffton, South Carolina – a town near Hilton Head – moved to the Palmetto State from the northeast to escape the cold winters.
And while most of them might be several years into their Social Security checks, many said they agreed with Perry’s assertion at the NBC/Politico debate on Wednesday that the program is a “Ponzi scheme to tell our kids that are 25 or 30 years old today, you’re paying into a program that’s going to be there.” 

“I think he’s probably right,” said Larry Vazzana, a Maryland native who retired in Bluffton. Vazzana, who said he thinks former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is the more electable candidate, said he fears Perry’s strong language may handicap the Texas governor but that his assertion is accurate.

“That’s an example of what I’m saying – he’s a bit outspoken and he shoots from the hip,” Vazzana added. “But I think if you look at it, he’s probably right. It’s a Ponzi scheme.”
Northern migrants like Vazzana make up a growing portion of South Carolina’s electorate. Beaufort County, home to Bluffton and Hilton Head, had one of the state’s biggest population surges, growing 34 percent according to the 2010 census. The area is also rich in primary voters, with 24.75 percent voter turnout in the 2008 Republican presidential primary, above the state’s 19.52 percent average.

...There is more.

I sense these Tea Party voters want to support Perry and want to see him do a better job of explaining his position.  They are probably right, but I think a lot of voters who have thought about the issue get it.  I also think Romney is making a mistake attacking Perry on the issue.  He is righting off the young voters who are paying the freight with little likelihood of getting much back.  The people on Social Security, like myself understand that Perry is not threatening our current payments.

Democrats getting worried





NY Times:

Democrats are expressing growing alarm about President Obama’s re-election prospects and, in interviews, are openly acknowledging anxiety about the White House’s ability to strengthen the president’s standing over the next 14 months.

Elected officials and party leaders at all levels said their worries have intensified as the economy has displayed new signs of weakness. They said the likelihood of a highly competitive 2012 race is increasing as the Republican field, once dismissed by many Democrats as too inexperienced and conservative to pose a serious threat, has started narrowing to two leading candidates, Mitt Romney and Rick Perry, who have executive experience and messages built around job creation.

And in a campaign cycle in which Democrats had entertained hopes of reversing losses from last year’s midterm elections, some in the party fear that Mr. Obama’s troubles could reverberate down the ballot into Congressional, state and local races.

...

But a survey of two dozen Democratic officials found a palpable sense of concern that transcended a single week of ups and downs. The conversations signaled a change in mood from only a few months ago, when Democrats widely believed that Mr. Obama’s path to re-election, while challenging, was secure.

...

There is little cause for immediate optimism, with polls showing Mr. Obama at one of the lowest points of his presidency.

His own economic advisers concede that the unemployment rate, currently 9.1 percent, is unlikely to drop substantially over the next year, creating a daunting obstacle to re-election.

Liberals have grown frustrated by some of his actions, like the decision this month to drop tougher air-quality standards.

And polling suggests that the president’s yearlong effort to reclaim the political center has so far yielded little in the way of additional support from the moderates and independents who tend to decide presidential elections.

“The alarms have already gone off in the Democratic grass roots,” said Robert Zimmerman, a member of the Democratic National Committee from New York, who hopes the president’s jobs plan can be a turning point. “If the Obama administration hasn’t heard them, they should check the wiring of their alarm system.”

...Their advice to Obama is a mistake.  

Anger is not a strategy and it is not appealing to voters.  Their fundamental problem is that the liberal policies they have pushed have not been effective and in many cases have been counterproductive.  The new regulations have caused so much uncertainty that employers do not know how much it will actually cost them to add additional employees.

Their health care law is still despised by over half the country and is being challenged in court by over half the states.  Dodd-Frank was a massive cover up of the Democrats' housing policy fiasco which forced lenders to make bad loans.

The NLRB looks like a job killer in South Carolina and the Justice Department is killing jobs in Tennessee with is case against Gibson Guitars pursuant to a law that seems to lack common sense or due process.  Making businesses responsible for knowing the laws of foreign countries just does not seem fair or reasonable.  

The Democrats seem oblivious to the effect of their policies and their regulations.

Saudis to try 'Lady al Qaeda'





Arab News:

A special criminal court will try Haila Al-Qaseer this month for allegedly joining Al-Qaeda, providing shelter to wanted terror suspects and funding terrorism.

According to the charges leveled by the public prosecutor, 47-year-old Al-Qaseer, nicknamed Um Al-Rabab, is also accused of recruiting militants for the terrorist organization and possessing weapons to use them for terrorist operations.

The Saudi woman is also accused of traveling to places of violence and battlegrounds without the permission of the ruler. Other charges include forging of ID cards for those who intend to go abroad to fight alongside militants in countries hit by civil wars.

During the trial Al-Qaseer will be given a chance to reply to the charges. According to a judicial source, the trial will take place within two weeks.

“The judge will ask the woman to read out her reply to him and the public prosecutor in the presence of her lawyers,” the source said. In the next session, the prosecutor will present evidence to try to prove the charges against the woman.

Al-Qaseer was arrested in the central city of Buraidah in March 2010 along with other wanted militants belonging to the same family. She is considered one of the principal financiers of Al-Qaeda.

“She was on the verge of having a marital relationship with the No. 2 of Al-Qaeda organization in Yemen, Saeed Al-Shahri,” the source said, adding that her main objective was collecting money for the organization. She had allegedly transferred $650,000 to terrorists.

...I am curious about what she will say when she is compelled to give her side.  She appears to be an important cog in the al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula franchise.  The trial may reveal some details about the organization that is fighting to control Yemen at this time.

British intelligence send family to Qaddafi prison





Observer/Guardian:

A Libyan Islamist has told how he and his family were imprisoned after being "rendered" in an operation MI6 hatched in co-operation with Muammar Gaddafi's intelligence services. The rendition occurred shortly before Tony Blair paid his first visit to the dictator.

Sami al-Saadi, his wife and four children, the youngest a girl aged six, were flown from Hong Kong to Tripoli, where they were taken straight to prison. Saadi was interrogated under torture while his family were held in a nearby cell.

"They handcuffed me and my wife on the plane, my kids and wife were crying all the way," he told the Guardian. "It was a very bad situation. My wife and children were held for two months, and psychologically punished. The Libyans told me that the British were very happy."

Saadi says he is now considering whether to sue the British government, making him the second Libyan rendition victim to threaten legal proceedings in less than a week.

The evidence that the family were victims of a British-led rendition operation is contained in a secret CIA document found in the abandoned office of Moussa Koussa, Gaddafi's former intelligence chief, in Tripoli last week.

In London, meanwhile, an official inquiry into Britain's role in torture and rendition since 9/11 says the government has provided information about the UK's role in the affair, and Whitehall sources defended intelligence agencies' actions by saying they were following "ministerially authorised government policy".

It is the first time evidence has emerged that the British intelligence agencies ran their own rendition operation, as opposed to co-operating with those that were mounted by the CIA.

Saadi was held for more than six years, during which time he says he was regularly beaten and subjected to electric shocks. Shortly after his arrival in Tripoli, he says, Moussa Koussa visited in person to explain how Gaddafi's new friends in the west were helping him track down the regime's opponents around the world. "He told me: 'You've been running from us, but since 9/11 I can pick up the phone and call MI6 or the CIA and they give us all the information we want on you. You've nowhere to hide.'"

...This sounds worse that Gitmo.  What is worse is that it appears to be part of a corrupt bargain with Qaddafi and not a real intelligence operation or anti terror operation.

Perry pokes for higher education reform





He has been pushing for reform since he was first elected, but is now starting to get some traction, at least with the people he appointed.  Andrew Ferguson provides the back ground.  I think this could be an issue for Perry in the Presidential race.

Perry responds to questions about jobs, Social Security







I think he gave some pretty good answers that will probably confound his critics.  He comes across as reasonable and thoughtful in dealing with a jobs agenda and how to fix Social Security.

New York, Washington forced to play their own version of '24'





NY Times:

Bomb-sniffing dogs were deployed in the Washington subway, and the police searched vehicles at the Brooklyn Bridge on Friday as counterterrorism officials with frustratingly imprecise clues hunted for at least two men reportedly dispatched by Al Qaeda to set off a car or truck bomb in New York or Washington.

Two senior American law enforcement officials said an informer in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region passed word of the plot, intended to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, to American intelligence officers on Wednesday. The informer said two American citizens of Arab ancestry had left Afghanistan, traveled through one or more other countries and reached the United States as recently as last week.

But the informer’s information on the plot was second- or third-hand, another official said. It included only a vague physical description of the two men — one described as 5 feet tall, the other 5-foot-8 — and a first name for one, Suliman, that is common in the Middle East. The tipster also described a third conspirator, but he appeared to have traveled to Europe. “All this information is very, very sketchy,” one of the law enforcement officials said.

While the informer was not specific about targets, officials in both New York and Washington increased scrutiny of bridges and tunnels, long considered potential targets for vehicle bombs.

...I am skeptical, but it would be foolish not to take the threat as serious as Jack Bauer would.  One reason for my skepticism is the difficulty of a couple of Muslim men to acquire the materials needed for a car bomb.  It is not like they have the same logistical pipeline they had in Afghanistan or Pakistan.  They may go for a gas canister bomb like the one that failed in Times square, but it is hard to conceal something like that.

It is possible that the enemy is just jacking with us hoping to put us on an expensive and disruptive alert.  That is something they can do.

CBS New York reports police are looking for a possible dirty bomb.  I think it would be difficult for them to acquire the ingredients in the US or ship them here.

Social Security is actuarialy unsound





Ed Driscoll:

...


On his personal blog, Jonathan Last of the Weekly Standard adds, “What has amazed me over the last week or so is the silliness of those who treat the argument as if it’s somehow out of bounds just because Rick Perry is making it. Believe it or not, Rick Perry is not the first person to view Social Security as a ‘Ponzi scheme’”:The first person I’ve found drawing the parallel is economist Paul A. Samuelson. In the November 13, 1967 Newsweek Samuelson defended Social Security by pointing out that it was linked to population growth and that “A growing nation is the greatest Ponzi scheme ever devised. And that is a fact, not a paradox.” (I found this quote in Phillip Longman’s excellent essay “Missing Children,” in the latest issue of the journal The Family in America. I can’t find the original Newsweek cite to provide full context, but Longman says that Samuelson was defending Social Security and I’m happy to trust him because Phillip Longman is stone-cold awesome.)Now, Samuelson is not a crank. He won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1970. The New York Timescalls him ”the foremost academic economist of the 20th century.” If you majored in econ during the last 30 years, there’s a good chance that you used his textbook, Economics.Nor is Samuelson a conservative. Remember, his likening of the underpinnings of Social Security to a Ponzi scheme were meant as a defense of the institution. And in 2003 he was one of a group of economists to sign a letter inveighing against the Bush tax cuts.Actually the full quote, as found via Google Books,  is memorable for its rosy mid-century Galbraithianassumptions about America’s future, which even in 1967 was beginning to fracture, through a series of dramatic technological, demographic, and societal changes.One of those changes was abortion which took over 50 million payers out of the system.  This meant that payments to baby boomers would be even more unsustainable.   The Roe v. Wade effect has had a profound effect on Social Security payments at this point.  Some will argue that it took recipients out of the picture later when the aborted would have come of age, but that misses the compounding effect of lost babies that they would have generated.  What it tells you is that at a certain point the scheme devised by FDR has a logical end like any Ponzi scheme.

Romney changing tactics and strategy





Houston Chronicle:

Rick Perry entered the Republican presidential race like a jackrabbit out of the West Texas prairie. He quickly hopped past longtime leader Mitt Romney, who was deliberately, step by step, inching his way toward the nomination he felt was his to win.

Now, Romney’s strategists are hoping that the former Massachusetts governor plays the tortoise to Perry’s hare, slowly and steadily working to win the long race while Perry zips into first and fades in the stretch.

But presidential contests are not fairy tales, and it’ll take a lot more than hope to make Romney win. That’s why the former Winter Olympics CEO and Bain Capital executive has adjusted his campaign’s business plan to take into account the unexpectedly strong challenge from a candidate they had not expected to enter the race.

With Perry leading Romney in the last nine national polls by margins ranging from 6 percentage points to 19, the former front-runner has overhauled his above-the-fray campaign persona. Over the past week, and during Perry’s first GOP presidential debate on Wednesday, Romney has begun to engage with his most serious challenger.

Some of the contrasts are direct: Romney has chosen to make the future of Social Security a key issue by declaring his strong support for the retirement program while Perry calls it a “monstrous lie” and a “Ponzi scheme.”

Some are indirect: Romney says the nation needs a hard-headed businessman (him) rather than a career politician (Perry) to guide it through hard times.

Some are tactical: Romney has intensified his efforts to court Tea Party Republicans in an attempt to compensate for Perry’s early successes among establishment conservatives.

Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said Romney needs to “show some life and fight” when challenging Perry.

“The whole point is to try to show himself as an adult at a very serious time,” Mann said. “And with Perry being more reckless, being a cowboy, Romney’s going to convey these times are too perilous to take a chance with that.”

For Romney to regain the lead, political analysts say, he needs to convince Republican primary voters who desperately want to defeat Barack Obama that he, not Perry, offers the Grand Old Party its best chance.

“What Romney has to do to beat back Perry is argue that Perry can’t be elected in the general election,” said Drake University political scientist Dennis Goldford. “Romney can argue that you need somebody who does more than make you feel good (with red-hot rhetoric), someone who won’t take the Republican Party off a cliff.”

...Romney's attack on Perry's Social Security position is disingenuous and is careless about the plight of young people paying into the system.  Many of the traditional reactionaries to change in the Social Security system recognize Perry has a point and I am sure that if Romney was doing a buy out he would be concerned about an under funding pension fund liability which is basically what we have with social Security.  I say this as a current recipient who is worried about what my children and grand children will have to do with the system.  Before this campaign is over with Perry will convince people that Romney and Obama have the irresponsible position of Social Security.

The Tea Party and many mainstream Republicans have always been suspicious of Romney and his passion for the ideas of the group.  He has done little to ease their minds on that score.  I do not see him taking votes from Perry.  The best that he can hope for is to be seen as an acceptable alternative should Perry's campaign fade.  I think the chances of Perry's Campaign fading are remote at this point.

You can't accused the Chronicle of having a home state bias in this race.  Since Perry announced they have been running more negative pieces than the NY Times and Washington Post.  Don't expect to waste his time meeting with their editorial board.

Feds delaying offshore drilling for study





Houston Chronicle:

The government is about to kick-start a long process for setting new offshore drilling safety standards — but only after a joint federal investigation into the Deepwater Horizon disaster is complete, a top Obama administration official told the Houston Chronicle.

At issue is the joint Coast Guard and Interior Department probe of the oil spill. Although the joint investigation team held its final public hearings in April, the panel has not yet issued its conclusions about the root causes of the disaster.

That final report is set to be released “in the very near future,” said Michael Bromwich, the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement.

The document is expected to identify failures at BP’s doomed Macondo well that may have contributed to its lethal blowout on April 20 last year and the resulting oil spill.

The panel’s report may provide the foundation for bolstering mandates on the blowout preventers used as a last line of defense against unexpected surges of oil and gas at wells. The joint investigation team’s conclusions about well design also could spur regulatory changes.

“Even though it is going to be a very broad rulemaking process and there will be plenty of time to get input, we thought we would be better served by seeing where the JIT came out on a variety of issues before we (began),” Bromwich said. “We have quite explicitly been waiting for the conclusion of the JIT process and the release of the JIT report before we go out with the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking.”

That advanced notice will kick off a long process of creating the new drilling safety regulation. Bromwich has stressed that the slower timetable will allow more people to weigh in on the measure’s content.

...Things would probably move quicker if we had better people in charge.  Bromwich has been a bigger disaster for US energy than the BP blowout.  I think we already largely know what went wrong and how to avoid it.  People who are invested billions of dollars in deep offshore drilling want to avoid BP type disasters more than anyone and they do not need Bromwich's foot dragging rule making to do their job.  It is just another job killing regulatory move by the Obama administration.

Obama's plan does not move employers





NY Times:

Employers Say Jobs Plan Won’t Lead to Spur in Hiring
They cay the economy is the reason they are not hiring and the incentives will not make a difference.  I have seen some complain about Apple's cash position and ask why they are not hiring.  The answer is simple.  The purpose of business is not to hire people but to sell goods and services.  When there is a business opportunity that requires more employees they usually find a way to hire them.    Spurring that activity in the current environment will require reducing regulations and programs that make the cost of long term hiring too risky.  Those who pushed Obamacare and Dodd-Frank just do not seem to comprehend the uncertainties they have forced on the market place.

Large crowd turns out for Perry at Corona del Mar, CA





Coronal del Mar Patch:

Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry made his first stop in California on Thursday morning, holding a GOP rally at Roger’s Gardens in Corona del Mar.

Texas Gov. Perry, fresh off of Wednesday night’s Republican debate, spoke to the crowd for close to 10 minutes, most of which was spent addressing the economy and jobs.

“With all due respect to my opponents, no one has a record like me when it comes to the economy and creating jobs in America,” Perry said, maintaining his position that Texas is one of the strongest states economically in the U.S.

Shouts of “I want my country back!” and “Obama must go!” rang out throughout Perry’s speech, but the rally was not without Perry detractors.

...

A small group from MoveOn.org, a national political action group, protested outside of the Perry event.

However, inside the rally, Perry supporters were exuberant.

“I just like his resolve,” said Todd Spitzer, former state Assemblyman and Orange County assistant district attorney. “He has an opinion, but it doesn’t appear like he’s not open-minded. You want presidents that make decisions and then have the confidence in the public to carry out the decisions.”

Larry Andre, 56, came from Lakewood to the rally. “I’m excited about Mr. Perry,” Andre said. “I’m excited that he wants to bring us back to the basics of our nation. I loved the speech. He’s a great man, and I think he’ll make a great president.”

Patricia Evans, who was also at the rally, said she has experienced the direct effects of the economy during her own job hunt.

“I’m a single mom, and I’m still out of a job,” Evans said. “I have a master’s degree, and I can’t seem to get a job.”

...California has a high unemployment rate.  Perry's message on jobs should resonate with that group.  The MoveOn crowd obviously senses Perry as a threat to the liberalism they push.  I am sure he will see more of them on the campaign trail.  Perry has to be pleased with the large enthusiastic crowds he is attracting.

Social Security talk gives Perry the edge with youth vote





Katie Pavlich:

Hey working young people, the government is stealing your money and not just once, every two weeks. We should applaud Rick Perry for being open and honest about the real situation of Social Security and youth voters should take note that Perry is looking out for them.

...

Well Mr. Romney, Social Security may be working, but it’s working on the backs of young people who are being lied to and scammed out of hundreds of dollars every two weeks when they get their paycheck.

“In the book Fed Up! Governor [Perry] you say that by any measure Social Security is a failure. You can’t say that to tens of millions of Americans who live on Social Security and those who have lived on it. The Governor [Perry] says states ought to be able to opt-out o f Social Security,” Romney said. “Under no circumstances, under any measure would I say it’s a failure.”

Texas Governor Rick Perry on the other hand, declared Social Security was a “Ponzi scheme,” because at minimum, that’s what it is, and was the only candidate in the Reagan debate to mention and address the 25-30 year-old demographic.

“You cannot keep the status quo in place and not call it anything other than a Ponzi scheme, it is, that is what it is, Americans know that and regardless of what anyone says, ‘oh it’s not,’ and that’s provocative language, maybe it’s time we have some provocative language in this country,” Rick Perry replied. “It is a Ponzi scheme to tell our kids that are 25 or 30 years today you're paying into a program that's going to be there,” adding, “Anybody that's for the status quo with Social Security today is involved with a monstrous lie to our kids, and it's not right.”

...Is Romney willing to write off the youth vote on the Social Security issue?  It is a question that at least young people will be asking.  As for the seniors, Perry's position is no threat to them and their Social Security payments despite the Romney and Democrat demagoguery.  The political consultant like Karl Rove are uncomfortable in taking on the unsustainable aspects of Social Security, but I think it is because they have been too timid in the past in dealing with the problem and they have not focused enough on the youth vote.

Obama continues to pull government levers hoping for different results





Opinion Journal:

If President Obama's economic policies have had a signature flaw, it is the conceit that by pulling this or that policy lever, by spending more on this program or cutting that tax for a year, Washington can manipulate the $15 trillion U.S. economy to grow. With his speech last night to Congress, the President is giving that strategy one more government try.

This is not to say that Mr. Obama hasn't made any intellectual progress across his 32 months in office. He now admits the damage that overregulation can do, though he can't do much to stop it without repealing his own legislative achievements. He now acts as if he believes that taxes matter to investment and hiring, at least for the next year. And he now sees the wisdom of fiscal discipline, albeit starting only in 2013.

Yet the underlying theory and practice of the familiar ideas that the President proposed last night are those of the government conjurer. More targeted, temporary tax cuts; more spending now with promises of restraint later; the fifth (or is it sixth?) plan to reduce housing foreclosures; and more public works spending, though this time we're told the projects really will be shovel-ready.

We'd like to support a plan to spur the economy, which is certainly struggling. Had Mr. Obama proposed a permanent cut in tax rates, or a major tax reform, or a moratorium on all new regulations for three years, he'd have our support. But you have to really, really believe in hope and change to think that another $300-$400 billion in new deficit spending and temporary tax cuts will do any better than the $4 trillion in debt that the Obama years have already piled up.

...Obama continues to prove that liberalism does not work but the liberal media chorus was rapturous in its approval of a speech full of magical thinking and ideas.  It was a political set up for blaming Republicans for the failure of his policies.  They could cross him up by giving him what he asked for.  If they did that, he would have even less to run on in 2012, and Rick Perry could run against his failed stimulus plan.

Mitt's malleable core convictions





Washington Times:

Already dogged by a reputation for political shifts on the campaign trail, Mitt Romney is once again honing a new sales pitch to voters, with the former Massachusetts governor now casting himself as a real-world “conservative businessman” who is in sync with the tea party while eager to slap sense into the “career politicians” he blames for the nation’s problems.

Despite some positive early reviews from his first face-off with chief rival Gov. Rick Perry of Texas at Wednesday’s GOP debate, the new pitch is a calculated gamble for Mr. Romney — a bet that he can carve out new territory in the crowded Republican field while battling the stereotype that he lacks core convictions.

“He’s a politician who would be perfectly comfortable in the 1960s when the media was controlled by a half-a-dozen political reporters and you could say one thing in one place and another thing in another place,” said Michael McKenna, a GOP strategist.

“But in this era, which is marked by lots of information and a real craving for authenticity, a guy like Romney has real trouble because I’m not really sure that he has any core beliefs except for two: He is mostly a free-market guy and he thinks he should be president of the United States.”

...He realized he could not win without the Tea Party vote and they just were not that in to him.  I do iteration will persuade them.  He was already suffering from a perception that he changed his pitch for his audience.  That is something Perry is rarely accused of.

Defeating al Qaeda





Charles Krauthammer:

...

What turned the strong horse into the weak horse? Precisely the massive and unrelenting American war on terror, a systematic worldwide campaign carried out with increasing sophistication, efficiency and lethality — now so cheaply denigrated as an “overreaction.”

First came the Afghan campaign, once so universally supported that Democrats for years complained that President Bush was not investing enough blood and treasure there. Now, it is reduced to a talking point as one of “the two wars” that bankrupted us. Yet Afghanistan was utterly indispensable in defeating the jihadis then and now. We think of Pakistan as the terrorist sanctuary. We fail to see that Afghanistan is our sanctuary, the base from which we have freedom of action to strike Jihad Central in Pakistan and the border regions.

Iraq, too, was decisive, though not in the way we intended. We no more chose it to be the central campaign in the crushing of al-Qaeda than Eisenhower chose the Battle of the Bulge as the locus for the final destruction of the German war machine.

Al-Qaeda, uninvited, came out to fight us in Iraq, and it was not just defeated but humiliated. The local population — Arab, Muslim, Sunni, under the supposed heel of the invader — joined the infidel and rose up against the jihadi in its midst. It was a singular defeat from which al-Qaeda never recovered.

True, in both wars there was much trial, error and tragic loss. In Afghanistan, too much emphasis on nation-building. In Iraq, the bloody middle years before we found our general and our strategy. But cannot the same be said of, for example, the Civil War, the terrible years before Lincoln found his general? Or the Pacific campaign of World War II, with its myriad miscalculations, its often questionable island-hopping, that cost infinitely more American lives?

...More than anything, Iraq discredited the al Qaeda mass murder for Allah strategy once it was turned onto other Muslims.  Iraq became a major distraction for al Qaeda that sapped their strategic energy and caused them to lose their souls.  It was why bin Laden was desperately trying to relabel his movement before he was killed.

Iraq was also where the Democrats completely lost any strategic sense in dealing with the war effort.  The first backed it and then when things were not going well the opposed it and wanted desperately to lose it.  They opposed the winning strategy and then when Obama was elected decided to take credit for winning it.  If cynicism was a strategy, the Democrats were all for it.

SEC cutting a deal with Fannie and Freddie





NY Times:

Regulators are nearing a settlement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over whether the mortgage finance giants adequately disclosed their exposure to risky subprime loans, bringing to a close a three-year investigation.

The proposed agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the terms being discussed, would include no monetary penalty or admission of fraud, according to several people briefed on the case. But a settlement would represent the most significant acknowledgement yet by the mortgage companies that they played a central role in the housing boom and bust.

And the action, however limited, may help refurbish the S.E.C.’s reputation as an aggressive regulator, particularly as the country struggles with the aftereffects of the financial crisis that the housing bubble fueled.

But the potential settlement — even it if it is little more than a rebuke — comes at an awkward time for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Last week, the government overseer of the two companies sued 17 large financial firms, blaming them for luring the mortgage giants into buying troubled loans. That is a similar accusation to the one the S.E.C. is leveling at Fannie and Freddie — that the two entities misled their own investors. The case against the financial firms could be complicated should Fannie and Freddie sound a note of contrition for their own role in the implosion of the mortgage market in settling with the S.E.C.

...That is a very subtle way of saying just how screwed up the case against the banks is.  It is just one part of the screw up since the government was the one requiring the banks to make the bad loans to begin with.  The Community Reinvestment Act and the Clinton approach to enforcing it lays behind the housing crisis and all the bad loans lies behind the financial debacle.  In fact the government should be suing itself and HUD for pushing this mess on the country.  Instead, we have had a massive cover up under the guise of regulation through the Dodd-Frank law and ridiculous law suits like the one against the victims of the CRA.

Obama's terrible ideas for the economy





Michael Barone:

Barack Obama looked and sounded angry in his speech to the joint session of Congress. He bitterly assailed one straw man after another and made reference to a grab bag of proposals which would cost something on the order of $450 billion—assuring us on the one hand that they all had been supported by Republicans as well as Democrats in the past and suggesting that somehow they are going to turn the economy around. He called for further cuts in the payroll tax (which if continued indefinitely would undermine the case of Social Security as something people have earned rather than a form of welfare) and for a further extension of unemployment insurance (perhaps justifiable on humanitarian grounds, but sure to at least marginally raise the unemployment rate over what it would otherwise be). He called for a tax credit for hiring the long-term unemployed (unfortunately, these things can be gamed). He gave a veiled plug for his pet project of high-speed rail (a real dud) and for infrastructure spending generally (but didn’t he learn that there aren’t really any shovel-ready projects?). He called for a school modernization program (will it result in more jobs than the Seattle weatherization program that cost $22 million and produced 14 jobs?) and for funding more teacher jobs (a political payoff to the teacher unions which together with other unions gave Democrats $400 million in the 2008 campaign cycle). “We’ll set up an independent fund to attract private dollars and issue loans based on two criteria: how badly a construction project is needed and how much good it would do for the country.” Yeah, sure. Like the screening process that produced that $535,000,000 loan guarantee to now-bankrupt Solyndra. And Congress should pass the free trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea. Except that Congress can’t, because Obama hasn’t sent them up there yet in his 961 days as president.

...There is more.  Barone notes that the President says these bad ideas are paid for, but does not say how.  It was a speech that liberals mostly loved.  that tells you how misguided it was from the get go.  Obama has a toxic tough when it comes to the economy.  We need to keep his hands off of it.

Liberal strawmen





Jonah Goldberg:

...

The ad is funny because nobody thinks liberals such as Maddow would support anything like the Hoover Dam today. The Hoover Dam is a marvel. But by today’s green standards, it is a crime against nature. If you tried to build it, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Greenpeace would be in court blocking it.

Look at all the activists attacking the proposed oil pipeline from Canada to the Texas coast. It would create thousands of construction jobs, yet liberals oppose it for the usual petrophobic reasons. Ironically, liberals love building highways and bridges, but loathe making it affordable to drive on them.

This is just a small example of the Catch-22 liberalism has found itself in. The left yearns to “go big,” but it wants to do so through the narrow routes it has created for itself. It says government must rush into this economic crisis like firemen into a burning building. But it also doesn’t want to lighten the useless baggage the firemen must carry or remove the Byzantine obstacle course it has decreed the figurative firefighters must run through before getting to work.

...And, that is what we got again from Obama.  Spend more on education and infrastructure and, BTW, take more money out of Social Security  to make it even less solvent.  He is asking us to make more sink hole investments in pot holes.

Cartels go after Mexico's teachers





Houston Chronicle:

Fewer people every day are spared the gangland violence besieging Mexico and now even poorly paid educators - charged with the tenuous future of the country's children - find themselves in corruption's cross hairs.

Hundreds of teachers stayed off the job in the troubled Pacific beach resort of Acapulco this week after receiving extortion demands and death threats circulated via handouts and the internet. Teachers earning more than $175 a week were warned to cough up 50 percent of their salaries and bonuses beginning Oct. 1 or face the consequences.

"Those who don't agree have the chance to leave," explained a note sent to a finance officer of the local school district, which ordered a detailed list of teachers and their salaries. "If they don't, they know we're not fooling around.

"Advise the principals that we are aware of the high charges they ask of parents," the note said. "They will receive a special visit."

The note was not signed, but widely assumed to be from local gangsters who are warring for control of illegal drug sales, smuggling and other criminal rackets in Acapulco.

The walkout shut down at least 53 elementary schools and threatened to close hundreds more in and near Acapulco. Most of the schools reopened Wednesday after state and federal officials vowed to provide adequate security.

"The schools have returned to normal," Jesus Nava, a spokesman for the Guerrero state government, said by phone Wednesday.

Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre vowed in announcing the enhanced security Tuesday that "the teaching community, the students and their parents can be assured that the vigilance operations will be working at all times."

It remains to be seen if more police and army patrols will quash the extortion attempts. But the Acapulco walkout was but the latest incident involving threats to children.

...I suspect the extortion attempt reflects a sense of desperation in the cartels as they see the crack downs effecting their mail line of business.  This kind of extortion is much more difficult to manage that transporting dope to dealers.

Perry says Obama's latest stimulus plan not the answer





Houston Chronicle:

...

“President Obama’s call for nearly a half-trillion dollars in more government stimulus when America has more than $14 trillion in debt is guided by his mistaken belief that we can spend our way to prosperity,” Perry said in a written statement Thursday night. “America needs jobs, smaller government, less spending and a president with the courage to offer more than yet another speech.”

...There are a lot of voters who agree with Perry's statement.  I am not sure just how serious Obama is about what he said.  It looks like a campaign set up for the next 14 months to shift blame for the mess he has made to his opponents.

Romney's Social Security blunder





Moe Lane:

You’ve probably read by now Mitt Romney adviser Stuart Stevens’ gleeful email to Ben Smith – and might I add that there is something unseemly about an ostensible Republican using Politico for what is essentially an internal debate? – crowing over Governor Rick Perry’s rather sensible observation that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme:He has lost. No federal candidate has ever won on the Perry program to kill Social Security. Never has. never will.A few things: first off, note that what Perry said is not what Romney had his minion accuse Perry of saying.  Just to get that out of the way.  Second – and much more importantly – federal candidates can in fact say in public that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and still win elections.  Just ask Senator Ron Johnson (R, WI): 

This could turn into a health discussion about the future of Social Security if the media and the politicians will just be honest about it rather than treating it as a taboo subject for behind closed doors Washington.

The case for calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme





Kyle-Anne Shiver:


According to the commentariat, Governor Rick Perry has stepped into a pile of electoral cow manure. Perry had the unrivaled gall to tell the truth about Social Security — that the program is, by design, a Ponzi scheme. As President Eloquent might say, the talking heads are “all wee-weed up.”Personally, I’d like to give Rick Perry a medal for courage and a laurel wreath for leadership. He has signaled his intention to speak truth boldly in terms real people can understand.Of course, Social Security is essentially a Ponzi scheme, fully dependent upon adequate numbers of new “investors” (workers) to pay off prior “investors” (retirees). But this week, Reason delineated three major Social Security facts that make it far worse than a Ponzi scheme, and audaciously added that Rick Perry was “soft-pedaling” his rhetoric on the subject. From Reason:One, a Ponzi scheme collects money from new investors and uses it to pay previous investors — minus a fee. But Social Security collects money from new investors, uses some of it to pay previous investors, and spends the surplus on programs for politically favored groups — minus the cost of supporting a massive bureaucracy. Over the years, trillions of dollars have been spent on these groups and bureaucrats.Two, participation in Ponzi schemes is voluntary. Not so with Social Security. The government automatically withholds payroll taxes and “invests” them for you.Three: When a Ponzi scheme can’t con new investors in sufficient numbers to pay the previous investors, it collapses. But when Social Security runs low on investors — also called poor working stiffs — it raises taxes.In fact, the Ponzi scheme/Social Security comparison was first made by the neo-Keynesian Nobel laureate Paul A. Samuelson. Writing in defense of Social Security in a 1967 Newsweek column, Samuelson opined:A growing nation is the greatest Ponzi scheme ever devised. And that is a fact, not a paradox.Unfortunately, Samuelson wrote this Social Security defense when America was just entering the huge baby-bust (1965 onward) that followed the post-war baby-boom (1946-1964). The rapidly declining birthrate was in 1967 still completely off the radar of the most astute demographers, which is probably why LBJ was able to sell the nation on the addition of Medicare to “the greatest Ponzi scheme ever devised.”

...I think this makes the argument that Perry put forward.  It adds focus to the claim.

Perry's opponents are making the bogus suggestion that by pointing this out he will alienate seniors.  As a new member of that demographic, I beg to differ.  My concern is not for my social Security payment, but for the payments my grand children will have to make to make payments for my children's generation.  If nothing is done you could confiscate all their earnings and still not make the payments.  That is a concern that needs to be addressed.

By attacking Perry, Romney and other detractors are demonstrating a lack of concern for those young people who are just starting to pay into the scheme.

US looking at staging troops in Kuwait  after Iraq withdrawal





AP:

The Obama administration is considering staging American troops in Kuwait next year as a backup or rotational training force for Iraq, after the Pentagon completes the scheduled withdrawal of its current 45,000-strong force from Iraq in December, U.S. officials said.

The proposal, not yet announced, is among a number of options the administration is considering for extending its military training role in still-violent Iraq, whose divided government has been reluctant to ask Washington directly to keep troops on its soil beyond this year.

...

The Obama administration favors a proposal that would leave 3,000 to 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq next year to train Iraqi forces, U.S. officials said this week. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because Iraq has not yet asked for any extension of forces.

It has not previously been reported that staging U.S. forces in Kuwait as a part of that training mission, or possibly along with that mission, is being considered. One of the U.S. officials said the administration would foresee the Kuwait arrangement lasting for three years, starting in 2012, with troops rotating into Iraq for six-month stints. No decisions have been made, and it was not clear whether direct talks with the Kuwaiti government have begun.

...I think the 3000 troop level is too small to be effective in a country the size of Iraq.  The story does not indicate how many troops would be based in Kuwait. but since the military wanted between 25,000 and 30,000 it might allow a force of sufficient size to lead with many Iraqi contingencies and it would give Kuwait and other Gulf states so assurance against an Iranian invasion.

Obama waste more federal loan guarantees on another solar venture





IBD:

...

Learning nothing from the Solyndra crackup and the many other green-energy failures, the White House, also last week, handed out an $852 million loan guarantee to the Genesis Solar Project in California. This 1,950-acre slice of federal land in Riverside County filled with parabolic solar panels is supposed to produce enough power — 250 megawatts — to light, heat and cool more than 48,000 homes.

Energy Secretary Steven Chu, who apparently has yet to meet a fossil fuel he can like, no matter how cheap and efficient it might be, stands fully behind the Genesis Solar Project. He wants the public to believe that it "will enable the deployment of clean, renewable sources at scale, which will help bring down the cost of solar power in the years to come."

Chu can be as blindly optimistic as he is blind to the facts about energy. Standing behind yet another poor government choice won't tarnish his professional reputation or ruin his career. But the hard lesson to be learned is that the Genesis Solar Project is bound to be another boondoggle.

How can it not be? If it were a viable project, it would be a magnet for private-sector investment. That it needs government help is an indicator that the market knows it's a venture not worth capitalizing.

...It is a point I make often, but apparently Chu and the Obama administration are committed to make the same mistakes Spain made in subsidizing losers.  Congress needs to stop funding these boondoggles.

Drunk elk gets stuck in apple tree





Apparently she over served herself on fermented apples then while under the influence lost her balance and got stuck in the tree. No charges were filed and the elk eventually went into the woods to recover.  The story indicate that Sweden has a lot of drunk elk this time of the year.

Perry tests whether voters can handle the truth about Social Security





Douglad MacKinnon:

...

Certain Republican candidates continue to put their fingers in the air to gauge the political winds and then give insulting non-answer answers that disgust a growing segment of voters. But Perry decided to take the Texas steer by its famous horns and speak directly and honestly to anyone who actually cared to listen.

During the debate that aired Wednesday night, moderators Brian Williams of NBC and John Harris of Politico let loose with a prepared question designed to put Perry on the spot and paint him in a corner as "too conservative" for the country.

Surprise! Their rhetorical trap backfired.

The liberal moderators basically challenged Gov. Perry to defend his accurate charge that Social Security in its current form is a "Ponzi scheme." In reality, they were hoping Perry would cower before them and back off his characterization of the failing program.

He did not.

Instead, with fire in his eyes after Mitt Romney tried to pile on by offering a transparent kiss-up to senior citizens, Perry said: "You cannot keep the status quo in place and not call it anything other than a Ponzi scheme. ... That's provocative language — maybe it's time to have some provocative language in this country."

It wasn't exactly "the shot heard 'round the world," but it will be a statement heard, pondered and deeply appreciated by conservative and independent voters who recognize that the "status-quo" and its many defenders in politics is what has gotten us in so much trouble in the first place.

In the post-debate analysis by the liberal mainstream media — with virtually all the far-left commentators curiously singing the praises of Mitt Romney — it is interesting to note that the Washington Post felt Perry "badly fumbled" on climate change. Really?

First, all who pay attention to this "Holy Grail of the Liberal-elite" subject understand that it was originally called "global warming" by the far left and mainstream media. But after being embarrassed time and again with temperatures that were not rising as alarmingly as predicted or were in fact falling , the far left decided to cover their bets and save face by defaulting to the name "climate change." This is similar to what they did when they decided to call themselves "progressives" instead of "liberals."

No matter what the far left calls itself or how much they scream and insult about the subject, Gov. Perry is right to say the "science" on "climate change" is far from settled.

In fact, much of the "science" is driven purely by a liberal agenda. Perry also rightfully noted that the "solutions" to "climate change" as put forth by the Obama White House and its media enablers would cripple the economy of our nation and wipe out millions of American jobs.

...Perry is not willing to play to their tune.  Time will tell whether people will punish him for being so frank about the problems of Social Security and the global warming hysteria from the left.  They are not used to be challenged on their own orthodoxy so they probably will not handle it well.

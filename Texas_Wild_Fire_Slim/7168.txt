Rustic Poet Review
Sep 2, 2011 | Der BĂ¤nkelsĂ¤nger (The Balladeer) | Album Reviews | Share
Rustic Poet. (Translated via multiple sources from the original German text)Well aged alt-country that's carried with a voice as hard as coffin nails. No one has a more hard-edged vocal and even though it's mumbled and grumbled it's Truely nothing short of a balladeer. "Rustic Poet" by Huke Green is full of earthen luck and misfortune. You can hear Greens distinctive guitar style in the opening "Backwoods" as it hangs involuntarily in the air. This is just the begining of an album that moves up and down in mournful streaks. "I've seen trouble fall like rain," Green sings in "Downtrodden Prayer," which is easlily a gem of the collection. These ten songs paint a perfect picture... a sonic landscape which must be listened to. The Texas songwriter seems like an outlaw sprung from a gritty Western. Long dark brown hair and a cowboy hat pulled low over his face. A pity, because behind it are hidden wanderlust devouring eyes. It's as if Green would not allow his thoughts to become far removed from himself. In "Praying For Rain" a violin motif is also only a few inches away, fawning to the prayerful voice. In "Devil's Shout" the violin will be even more intimate, prominantly in the foreground of the haunting lyrics.Sometimes, however, a joyful nature can not be uprooted by anger. Such is the case in the roots rocking "Next To Me". Then, even if subliminaly, we are brought back down into the melancholy "Letter to A Son", only to be followed by the directly positve, when elated again he sings of friends, sunshine, and the beatiful quirks of life.in "Front Porch" the harmonica at the ready, the banjo under his arm, Green is redeemed unto himself, and his world seems at peace. Then the album comes full circle when the plaintive violin and rusty strings in the final "Peggy" put things right again. Huke has managed a rare instance where the album title not only reflects himself, but also his music. Gawain

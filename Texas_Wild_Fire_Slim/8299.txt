Colombian president shakes up military commandAP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011





BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — President Juan Manuel Santos has replaced Colombia's military chief and also named new army, navy and air force commanders after announcing a new injection of $800 million in defense spending.The replacement of Adm. Edgar Cely as armed forces chief comes amid stepped up attacks by leftist rebels and rising violence by drug-trafficking right-wing gangs.The new military chief is Gen. Alejandro Navas, promoted from army chief. Navas is a counterinsurgency expert who previously commanded a U.S.-trained rapid reaction force and hunted down FARC rebels in their traditional stronghold.The changes a year after Santos took office follow his naming last week of new Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon.

The governments are playing the game of satin by allowing evil to flourish, while they manipulate the media too propagate their evil agenda!! they promote hate!! as they prepare for most of our demises. I do not understand there thought pattern on how there going to survive in there bunkers. because its all been written in plane English right there in the bible! a generation will not pass after Israel becomes a nation!! and those who love unto the end will be saved.
 It also says every knee will bow and tong confess the Jesus is lord of lords i suspect there listening too the other guy and not God but they will not escape judgment!!! i assure everyone!!

We have sprays, parasite bugs and worms to drop and bread on the coke crops. We could erradicate the coke crops in South Americaand the heroin poppys of Afghanistan merely by spraying them or dropping bugs that eat those plants. Since the invasion of Afghanistan 60% of the heroin in the USA comes from there compared to 7% before the war. Talaban get their revenue from the heroin and the leftists FARC from the coke. Anyone care to guess why we don't erradicate those crops (which would be cheaper than current anti-drug efforts or building foreign armys)instead of using our current methods? Too many politicians worldwide, including our own, are involved in the drug trade. They spend hundreds of biliions of the people's money as show, but really do nothing. Meantime their payoffs and profits keep coming in. Same thing with illegal aliens...politicians make money off it.

The last few years the world has gone from one Earth-shaking crisis to another. While some say that we are on the threshold of a Brave New World Order, others warn that humanity now totters on the brink of unprecedented disaster & chaos!

Reading the news nowadays is not the most cheerful way to start the day! Day by day the world's problems grow more desperate & insurmountable. The question which plagues every thinking person is...What lies ahead?

But has any mortal man ever been able to transcend the bounds of time & peer into the future? Throughout history there have been many who have claimed such powers, and some like Nostradamus, the Fatima Children, Edgar Cayce and Jeane Dixon are widely accepted as having predicted various future events.

And the world stage is now being set for the fulfillment of one awesome vision that many of these seers had in common: an event so cataclysmic that it will change the World as we now know it for ever...the final apocalypse, Armageddon!

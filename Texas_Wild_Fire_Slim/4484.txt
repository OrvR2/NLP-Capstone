2011-09-06: 
                     BASTROP, Texas (AP) — Firefighters trying to control a wind-fueled wildfire that has destroyed nearly 500 homes in Central Texas were looking for a few overnight hours of diminished winds as thousands of evacuees spent the night away from their threatened homes. Slack winds were expected after midnight Tuesday and could enable firefighters to make progress on the massive blaze racing through rain-starved farm and ranchland, authorities said. Fanned in part by howling winds from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee, the blaze rapidly grew Monday to at least 25,000 acres. "You have to be optimistic and at the...

September 28, 2010 www.infowars.com www.prisonplanet.tv www.infowars.net www.prisonplanet.com Update: UT Law has canceled John Lott's talk. Infowars.com has learned that an open carry event was scheduled on the UT campus today, the scene of a shooting earlier today. From the Students for Liberty website: On Tuesday, September 28 at 6:00pm, a coalition of student organizations on the University of Texas Austin campus, including the Libertarian Longhorns, the UT Students for Concealed Carry on Campus, the UT Objectivism Society and the UT Federalist Society, will be hosting John Lott, famed defender of gun rights and author of the book "More Guns, Less Crime". Lott's work in "More Guns, Less Crime" is commonly cited by many liberty-minded people when arguing against gun control laws, and Lott will be sharing some of his expertise in this field to the audience of students and members of the community of Austin. Austin has been a hot-bed of debate over the potential of state laws being passed that would make it legal for a person to carry a concealed handgun on college campuses. If you are in the Austin area on the 28th, stop by the UT Law School and hear John Lott discuss the negatives of gun control and the positives of a free society! The fact that the shooting occurred prior to the talk is, to say the least, highly suspicious. www.infowars.com

July 14, 2011 — (DALLAS, TX) At least eight people were hurt Thursday morning while scrambling to line up for a limited number of Dallas County rental vouchers — after waiting for hours in their cars. People lined up Thursday morning to apply for Dallas County Section 8 housing vouchers. Dallas County sheriff's spokesman Kim Leach estimated the crowd at about 5000. The office at the Jesse Owens Memorial Complex wasn't supposed to open until 8 am, but some applicants started lining up at 10 o'clock Wednesday night. Police kept people off school district property until the gates opened at 6 am That resulted in a long string of cars lined up on the streets. Doors were opened early. Hundreds of people rushed the line, causing moments of unruliness. "I started running and I slipped and fell," said applicant Jordan Spivey, who suffered cuts and scrapes as she was caught up in the crowd. But she said she feels lucky that she wasn't trampled. "It was a madhouse," said applicant Ada McKinsey, who was injured as the crowd closed in around the door. "People pushing, fighting." But authorities eventually gained control. Seven people were treated by paramedics. None were taken to the hospital. The question is: Why didn't organizers plan for more people and have more security in place to keep the crowds under control? Organizers of the event said they didn't plan for people to start arriving until Thursday morning. But people who started showing up as early as Wednesday afternoon were <b>...</b>

Tracing the long, convoluted history of UFO encounters and research, this unique series opens new windows into the controversial field. In April 1897--50 years before the alleged UFO crash in Roswell, New Mexico--a mysterious airship crash rocked the small town of Aurora, Texas...or at least, that's how the legend goes! The tale includes the wreckage from the ship, a funeral for the dead "alien" pilot, and thousands of witnesses from across the country. And the Aurora crash allegedly took place five years before the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk, so whatever was in the air was not manmade. Eyewitness accounts of the crash, mysterious metal found at the site, and the hunt for the only known alien graveyard are all combined into a story that has even the most adamant debunkers baffled.

Police Brutality: CNN reports that police are accused of having robbed at least 150 drivers in Tenaha, Texas. The amount stolen is close to $3 million, says a lawyer who has filed a class action suit against the town and police department there. Some of the victims (who are mostly African American) said that when they complained to the police about the police, the police threatened to take the victims' children away. In one case, the district attorney sent a couple who'd been robbed a form letter to sign that said, in exchange for forfeiting the $6000 that had been stolen from them, "...no criminal charges shall be filed...and our children shall not be turned over to [child protective services]." The video is loaded with lots of other tragicomically sordid details.

Author: minnesotachris


paul.house.gov http Last week we once again heard numerous voices calling for intervention in Libya. Most say the US should establish a "no-fly" zone over Libya, pretending that it is a benign, virtually cost-free action, and the least we could do to assist those trying to oust the Gaddaffi regime. Let us be clear about one thing: for the US to establish a "no fly" zone over all or part of Libya would constitute an act of war against Libya. Establishing any kind of military presence in the sovereign territory of Libya will require committing troops to engage in combat against the Libyan air force, as well as anti-aircraft systems. The administration has stated that nothing is off the table as they discuss US responses to the unrest. This sort of talk is alarming on so many levels. Does this mean a nuclear strike is on the table? Apparently so. In this case, I would like to make sure we actually follow the black letter of the law provided in the Constitution that explicitly grants Congress the sole authority to declare war. This week I will introduce a concurrent resolution in the House to remind my colleagues and the administration that Congress alone, not the president, decides when to go to war. It is alarming how casually the administration talks about initiating acts of war, as though Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution does not exist. Frankly, it is not up to the President whether or not we intervene in Libya, or set up "no-fly" zones, or send troops. At least <b>...</b>

Author: RussiaToday


As fire crews gain ground against one of the most destructive wildfires in Texas history, some residents of Bastrop county, who lost their houses to the flames, were gearing up on Wednesday to rebuild their homes. The blaze has left at least two people dead, blackened about 45 square miles (116.55 square kilometres) around Bastrop and cast a haze over Austin, 25 miles (40 kilometres) to the west. Firefighters report that the flames are at least 30 percent contained after burning uncontrolled for three days. Thousands of Texans have been evacuated from Central Texas and forced to put their lives on hold, as they wait find out if their homes are still standing. The wildfire is the most catastrophic of more than 170 blazes that have erupted in the past week across the Lone Star State, which is perilously dry because of one of the state's most severe droughts on record.

If you want to know more about this angel contact her on facebook and send her a message here: www.facebook.com Marilyn Mock Says 'People Need to Help Each Other' By JONANN BRADY Tracy Pottsboro lost her job and then her home when she couldn't make mortgage payments. On Saturday, she watched as her home was auctioned off in Dallas. "The final farewell to my house," Pottsboro said. "It means so much to all of us. It's not just a house." Auctions on foreclosed houses are an opportunity for some and agony for those who've lost their homes. From July through September of this year, more than 2700 Americans lost their homes to foreclosure every day, according to The Associated Press. In Texas, almost 9200 homes entered the foreclosure process in September. On Saturday, Pottsboro took her seat among the crowd, waiting for house No. 73 to be called. Marilyn Mock, a small-business owner from Rockwall, Texas, had accompanied her son, who was interested in buying a house, to the auction that day. Mock was sitting near Pottsboro and noticed that she was upset. "She was crying, and I asked her what is she upset about, and you know, she lost her house," Mock said. When the No. 73 came up and the auction began, Mock said she asked Pottsboro, "Is it worth it?" "She said yes. & I just kept taking her word," Mock said. Mock ended up winning the auction, with a bid of about $30000. And just like that <b>...</b>

A JetBlue flight from Boston was canceled Tuesday morning after a suspicious powder was found on the plane. 
The flight was set to leave Boston Logan airport at 6:40 a.m. Tuesday, bound for Fort Myers, Fla. But, before takeoff, a flight attendant found white powder in a tissue box, Massport spokesman Phil Orlandella told FOX 25 News.
The attendant notified authorities and was taken to a hospital as a precaution. The passengers, none of which were on the plane, were moved to another flight, reports CBS Boston.
Tests revealed the powder was not hazardous, but the jet has been quarantined for inspection.
Last month, another suspicious powder scare turned out to be marijuana. And, in July, a JetBlue plane originating at Boston Logan had an incident with a stun gun onboard one of its flights.

																Watching Slater's rant got me to thinking: it's a shame things like this don't happen more often.   Sometimes people need to rip off their masks of social nicety and express normal feelings of frustration.

																Saturday night, my flight from West Palm Beach to JFK was delayed 8 hours. The terminal was ripe with activity and gave me plenty of fruit to feed on, and some bad seeds to learn from.

				Oh my god, a suspicious powder! People if it is anthrax, which is the most dangerous substance it can be, it has to be aerated to cause issues. Unless you are stupid enough to snort it! Most of the time the powder is just a powder, some of Aunt Mable's dusting powder perhaps.

				Suspicious powder? Lol, yeah right. I wonder when Americans will wake up . . the rest of the world seems to be able to see that we are imprisoned­, and brainwashe­d. People need to ask questions! I tried to warn people that scanners were coming. In no less than 1 year, every single airport had them. These are coming next: http://www­.youtube.c­om/watch?v­=ejxhRG3gp­MY
When will we fight back as a people, without thinking about nationalit­y, without being jealous of one another, without being greedy, just joining in love and fighting back.

				hum, lets see.   White powder in a tissue box.   Suspicious­?    Perhaps it's a bit of baby powder that mommy spilled while using a tissue to wipe baby's bum????    But whatever, lets scare the hell out of the passengers since we have nothing better to do.    Damn, I'm glad I'm not a reporter trying to seek out every little happenings to keep my job.

				I'm not sure how these findings reflect on Jet Blue. On one hand, it sounds like the security is really good because the found these things, but on the other, you have to wonder how they got on the plane in the first place.

Obama kicks off 9/11 anniversary commemorations by honoring veteransBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Tue, Aug 30, 2011

(Carolyn Kaster/AP)In Minneapolis today, President Barack Obama gave the first in a series of speeches marking the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The president spoke before a crowd of 6,000 veterans at the American Legion's national convention.
In his remarks, Obama called for Americans to honor the solemn anniversary by performing national service, and repeatedly praised the nobility of the 5 million Americans who have served in the U.S. military since 9/11. He called these soldiers and their families members of the "9/11 generation." Obama also expressed humble gratitude for the sacrifice of more than 6,200 American servicemen and women who have been killed in conflict since 9/11.
"In a decade of war, they have borne an extraordinary burden, with more than two million of our service members deploying to the warzones," Obama said in his speech at the Minneapolis Convention Center.  "Hundreds of thousands have deployed again and again, year after year.  Never before has our nation asked so much of our all-volunteer force—that 1 percent of Americans who wears the uniform."
Watch highlights from the speech via ABC News here:

Obama also expressed the need for the United States to shift its focus from war-fighting abroad to nation-building at home. The president has echoed the same theme in several other recent high-profile addresses, including the speech announcing the decision to draw down surged U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the announcement authorizing only a limited U.S. military role in the NATO intervention in Libya, and in a White House awards ceremony to honor a living veteran of the war in Afghanistan.
He also reprised his call for a restored sense of national unity--a major theme of his breakout keynote address to the 2004 Democratic National Convention. And since presidential appeals for unity almost always include a  swipe at the sowers of dissension on the other side of the aisle, Obama also obliquely evoked the lingering bitterness in Washington over last month's debt ceiling battle, and vowed that future confrontations over federal budget cuts will not be fought on the backs of American veterans.
The president then circled around to what is certain to be a key theme of his 2012 re-election bid: the effort to jumpstart the U.S. economy. This marks, he argued, "the final area where America must meet its obligations to our veterans, indeed, where we need each other: ... the task of renewing our nation's economic strength." After praising the accomplishment of U.S. troops in killing Osama bin Laden in May, the president announced that "it's time to focus on nation building here at home.  And our veterans, especially our 9/11 generation veterans, have the skills and the dedication to help lead the way."
To that end, Obama announced programs to help unemployed veterans find jobs in the private sector and to mandate the Veterans Administration to make it easier for veterans to get medical coverage for ailments attributed to their service, including post-traumatic stress syndrome, traumatic brain injury, and once-stigmatized post-combat psychological ailments that have led to an epidemic of military suicides.
Obama will be spending the bulk of the days leading up to the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks making a series of similarly themed remarks. But that's not the only way that his administration is marking the occasion. As the New York Times notes today, the White House has also promulgated detailed guidelines for commemorating the occasion to U.S. federal officials and embassies abroad.
The White House guidelines instruct U.S. government offices "to honor the memory of those who died on American soil but also to recall that Al Qaeda and other extremist groups have since carried out attacks elsewhere in the world, from Mumbai to Manila," the New York Times' Thom Shanker and Eric Schmitt wrote.
One set of White House guidelines "is framed for overseas allies and their citizens and was sent to American embassies and consulates around the globe," their report continues. "The other includes themes for Americans here and underscores the importance of national service and what the government has done to prevent another major attack in the United States. That single-page document was issued to all federal agencies, officials said."

Obama doesn't care about veterans.  We haven't received a cost of living increase since he took office.  Services from the V.A. are curtailed and a lot of veterans are homeless and hang out at V.A. hospitals during the while illegals live for free.  He is counterfeit.

Barrack Obama walks into the Bank of America to cash a check. As he approaches the cashier he says "Good morning Ma'am, could you please cash this check for me"?

Cashier: "It would be my pleasure sir. Could you please show me your ID"?

Obama: "Truthfully, I did not bring my ID with me as I didn't think there was any need to. I am President Barrack Obama, the president of the United States of America!!!!"

Cashier: "Yes sir, I know who you are, but with all the regulations, monitoring, of the banks because of imposters and forgers, etc I must insist on seeing ID"

Obama: "Just ask anyone here at the bank who I am and they will tell you. Everybody knows who I am"

Cashier: "I am sorry Mr. President but these are the bank rules and I must follow them."

Obama: "I am urging you please to cash this check. "

Cashier: "Look Mr. President this is what we can do: One day Tiger Woods came into the bank without ID. To prove he was Tiger Woods he pulled out his putting iron and made a beautiful shot across the bank into a cup. With that shot we knew him to be Tiger Woods and cashed his check. Another time, Andre Agassi came in without ID. He pulled out his tennis racquet and made a fabulous shot whereas the tennis ball landed in my cup. With that spectacular shot we cashed his check So, Mr. President, what can you do to prove that it is you, and only you, as the President of the United States?"

Obama stood there thinking, and thinking and finally says: "Honestly, there is nothing that comes to my mind. I don't have a clue. I can't think of a single thing."

Cashier: "Will that be large or small bills, Mr. President?"

lol, ohhhh this is soooo perfect - now the whackos will trash him for remembering and honoring the victims of 9/11 with veterans. I swear, he could turn fecal matter to gold  and use it to pay off the national debt and the whackos would crying foul because he didn't give i to them or because he used un-Godly powers or because he paid the debt too fast or blah blah blah.........
DO THESE PEOPLE REALIZE HOW DUMB THEY SOUND AND THEN HOW MANY VOTERS THEY DRIVE INTO OBAMAS CAMP!?!?!?
Nobody likes to follow idiots and losers so if you talk like an idiot and trash talk the winner what does that make you?

Bush sent our troops (including me) into a war with a country that had nothing to do with 9/11 and Obama is working on bringing us home...And you hate him for it? Really?

"Obama will be spending the bulk of the days leading up to the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks making a series of similarly themed remarks"  So in other words, business as usual, just campaigning and forgetting about trying to run the country, THE JOB HE IS PAID TO DO!!!!

I guess the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, should not give awards to heros? What a strange line of thinking some of you have. Who cares that it's Obama, he's our President. Would you be whining if it was Romney? Bachman? Perry? I don't remember any of them serving in the armed forces either.

are we sure he is going to honor the American veterans or is he going to honor the muslim so called veterans that made us all stand still  that day and hold are families close. as we all know he had something to do with 9/11. he is the biggest mistake the country could have ever made. we as American's need to stand up for our freedom and love for this country. you don't see other countrys putting up with there bad presidents they go in and take them by the back of the shirt and paints and kick them to the curb.

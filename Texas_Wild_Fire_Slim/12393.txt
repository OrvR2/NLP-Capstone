Texas wildfires claim 700 homes, force evacuationsAFP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

Crews in Texas Tuesday battled dozens of wildfires that have destroyed more than 700 homes in just two days and forced thousands to flee thick smoke and flames.
"This is one of the meanest fires I've ever seen," Texas Governor Rick Perry told reporters after an aerial tour of the homes destroyed in the Steiner Ranch subdivision.
"The magnitudes of these losses are pretty stunning." 
The Republican White House hopeful had been campaigning in South Carolina ahead of a major debate on Wednesday night when the fires swept through subdivisions and towns near the state capitol of Austin.
He bowed out of several events so he could survey the damage and meet with evacuees.
The fires have been fanned by winds from a tropical depression that hit the southern United States over the weekend and have flared across ground left tinder dry by an intense summer drought, killing at least two people.
The worst blaze remains uncontrolled after devouring 30,000 acres (47 square miles or 121 square kilometers) and nearly 600 homes in Bastrop county, prompting mass evacuations as weather forecasts suggested the situation would get worse before it gets better.
More than 250 fire personnel battled the blaze in Bastrop, with planes and helicopters dumping water from above, but across the state the crews struggled to refill at lakes and rivers drained by the long, hot drought.
"There's practically a fleet of aircraft in the air," said Jan Amen, a Forest Service spokeswoman in Bastrop. "Problem is, we have to share them with other fires because there's so many burning in the area."
In East Texas, a fast-moving fire is believed to have killed a 20-year-old woman and her child, who failed to get out of their trailer home fast enough.
Gregg County Sheriff Maxey Cerliano told reporters the victims were found dead near Gladewater, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east of Fort Worth.
 Firefighters have responded to 181 blazes that have burned more than 118,000 acres in the past week, according to the latest situation report from the Texas Forest Service.
More than 3.5 million acres -- about the size of the state of Connecticut -- have been burned by 18,719 blazes since the wildfire season began in December.
Officials have ruled out arson as the cause of the fires and instead blame Tropical Depression Lee, which  was graded as a more serious tropical storm when it came ashore in southern Louisiana early Sunday.

I'm from the Dallas area and my father has been a firefighter in the North Texas area for over twenty-five years.  He has been in Possum Kingdom off and on for several weeks fighting the areas second wildfire this year.  I'm currently living in Austin (near Bastrop) and the smoke and flames are relentless.  I have extended family staying in our living room because their community is in ashes.  The wages of firefighters has always been something I was made aware of, and it is disgusting the way Perry runs my state.   As a Texan I want it to be clear that not everyone voted for Perry, and many who did no longer want him in Austin and definitely don't want him in the White House.  However, right now I think we should focus positive energy, prayers, and whatever recourses you may have to those being affected.  I think we can rise above Perry's ignorance and come together as a community, state, and nation to help each other in times of need instead of making petty comments about political ideology.

It is really sad for Texas, especially because Republicans are not going to help those in need, they never do . Republicans don't believe in helping their neighbor in need, just in doing what Jesus wants, making more money.

Some Texans explained that their firemen are all volunteers. Bravo for their good hearts (the firemen) but nothing like tons of well trained and paid professionals. THAT is an area one should not be cheap about.

Stupid people, again putting politics in the middle of a total tragedy. These are humans-black, white, brown, short, tall, Jewish, Christian, Catholic...conservative, liberal, rich poor- but all still human beings!!! So what if it is an earthquake in Japan, the northern US flooding, the midwestern tornadoes, the eastern US hurricane, or the Texas fires... Every one of these people is going through a horrible catostrophe. No wonder this country is so messed up- hateful idiots like you are allowed to vote!!! God bless all of those everywhere who are enduring disasters and hardships.

Fire would probably be out by now had Rick Perry not went on a cutting spree and fired half of Texas's firemen.

Hopefully those people fleeing the fires in Texas will be treated better than they themselves treated the people fleeing Katrina.

What a bunch of #$%$ mindless morons on this site.  Regardless of whether you're a democrat or republican, put yourself and your home,  in this fire situation.  How do you think you'd feel if it was happening to you....and you morons are putting a political spin to this???  And, don't be bashing Texans as ALL southerners, they've moved into Texas from other parts of the U.S.  You know the parts that don't have a good economy but Texas does.  And, if they want help for the federal government...so be it., they put in more than their fair share.  So grow up.  Quit sniffing your crappy underwear, you're getting #$%$ for brains.  Signed X-yankee living in Texas.

Attention satan followers... Your comments are offensive and wayyyyy outta line. people are losing their homes/lives out here due to these wildfires and you find it funny? you are blessed and you dont even realize it, obviously you still have your homes, family, and whatever else you cherish. How could you have so much hate in your hearts that you wish this upon another human being? Well, I believe in GOD and Im sure he doesnt tolerate your ignorant behavior but I will do what's best and pray for you all! God bless you!

Throw Wet Teabags on the fire and then vote conservatives into oblivion. Firefighters should be reserved to the people who want to pay their fair share of taxes without whining.

Conservatives do not want to fund fire fighters or their health care or the resources to fight these fires. It would be great if we could leave them to god and putting out fires with Wet teabaggers.

I feel empathy for Texans caught up in this nightmare.
Prayer isn't going to get 'em out of harm's way though. Hard work, sacrifice, and charitable offerings from around the country along with a some good luck for a change would do a lot of good.
Best Wishes from Arizona, we know a few things about wildfires.

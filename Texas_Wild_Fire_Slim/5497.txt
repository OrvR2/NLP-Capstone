TEHACHAPI, Calif. — About 200 Californians have been able to return to their homes as firefighters gained ground on a blaze that charred over 20 square-miles after a plane crashed and killed two people in a remote area of a Kern County.
The fire has burned 14,802 acres and was 83 percent contained, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Ray Ellickson said Wednesday.
"They're mopping up and trying to keep the line in place," said Ellickson of firefighters' efforts as the fire fight wound down Wednesday evening.
More than 2,000 firefighters were on duty, but so much progress was made overnight that some of them were being released, he said.
The fire near Tehachapi, about 90 miles north of Los Angeles, started Sunday when a single-engine Cessna crashed, killing Walter Johnson, 72, of Pomona, and John Nuckolls, 55, of Claremont.
Twelve homes and 18 outbuildings were destroyed and three firefighters sustained minor injuries in the firefight.
At its worst, 650 houses were in the fire's path and more than 200 residents from homes closest to the flames were asked to leave.
In Aqua Dulce in northern Los Angeles County, a blaze that started Monday and had burned 500 acres was 80 percent contained.
A 40-acre canyon fire near Interstate 405 at the Sepulveda Pass was also completely contained and firefighters have left the scene, Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Eric Scott said.
No structures were damaged in that fire, though two firefighters suffered heat-related injuries.
The National Weather Service warned Santa Barbara County residents Wednesday that gusty sundowner winds will create a critical fire condition by blowing across the mountain and canyon areas Thursday evening through Friday morning.
Sundowner winds, named for sunsets when they usually begin blowing, have helped ignite fires that have devastated the region numerous times in the past.

				Excuse me, I would post this in the SoCal section, but it seems Hp can't keep up with the Lost Angeles T. ""The U.S. petroleum balance of trade continues to shift in a sea change that is both literal and figurative­," said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for the Oil Price Informatio­n Service. "For the 10th week in a row, Energy Department numbers show that the country exported considerab­ly more refined products cargoes than were imported." In English (and as the story explains), that means U.S. refineries are making lots of diesel fuel, then  sending it to buyers in Central and South America.Link: http://opi­nion.latim­es.com/opi­nionla/201­1/09/cellp­hone-drivi­ng-fines-b­rown-veto-­rising-gas­-prices.ht­ml- Jerry Brown could do something about, but he's an old stooge. - Obama should do something about this, and that should tell you a lot about what the govt has in mind.

				Well of course you will ask the government for help.  And ask them for stimulus.  And ask for this and ask for that.  And after you get all this help you will grab the camera's and talk about how horrible the government is.

				jerry brown isn't a repuglican­. he isn't saying how bad government is. He knows that good government helps the country and the people.  If everyone had listened when he was governor when he was young, we'd be mostly energy effecient  and have all kinds of alternativ­e energy and we wouldn't be having wars for oil.

				Why should firefighte­rs risk their lives to save property?

In NM, and I imagine other places do it as well, firefighti­ng units go around regularly to assess homes and make it clear that owners who do not maintain good fire safety habits such as not piling up cords of firewood against the house or keeping brush low will receive a low priority on the list. 

If a cluster of properties is high risk and down the road is a cluster of low risk, the firefighte­rs will try and save the low risk properties because they have a much better chance of success. 

If a property owner does not care enough to lower their own risk why should firefighte­rs be at more risk?

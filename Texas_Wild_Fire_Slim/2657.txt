Turkey says Israel not keeping to defense dealsBy SUZAN FRASER - Associated Press | AP – 18 hrs ago

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey's prime minister accused Israel on Wednesday of failing to meet its obligations in defense deals, adding to tensions with Israel which have escalated since an Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla killed nine people last year.Turkey last week expelled top Israeli diplomats, suspended all military deals and vowed to step up Turkish navy patrols in the eastern Mediterranean, angered over its former ally's refusal to apologize for the raid that killed eight Turks and one Turkish-American.Turkey also promised to lobby for support for the Palestinians' bid for state recognition at the United Nations and warned that more sanctions against Israel could follow.Asked to comment on Turkey's decision to suspend defense industry deals, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters Israel wasn't keeping to the terms of defense agreements, accusing it of not returning drones that Turkey had bought from Israel and sent back for maintenance."They are not loyal to agreements between us in the defense industry," Erdogan said. "There might be problems, you may not be speaking to each other, but you have to fulfill your responsibility under international agreements."Turkey has purchased 10 Heron drones from Israel, following the lease of a number of unmanned spy planes from the country. It was not clear how many of the drones are in Israel for maintenance.Turkey uses the drones to spy on Kurdish rebels, who maintain bases in northern Iraq, and have escalated their attacks on Turkish troops and police officers lately.Turkey's sanctions against Israel — once a top military trading partner — follows a U.N. report into the flotilla raid, which accuses Israel of using excessive force, but also describes Israel's blockade of Gaza as legitimate.Turkey has rejected the report, while Israel accepted it with some reservations.Israel has expressed regret for the loss of lives aboard the flotilla but has refused to apologize saying its forces acted in self-defense. It has also said it was time for the two countries to restore their former close ties.But Erdogan said Wednesday Turkey was determined to keep up its stance toward Israel at any cost."We don't care if it costs $15 million or $150 million," Erdogan said. "We will not allow anyone to walk all over our honor."Erdogan reiterated that Turkey was planning possible new sanctions against Israel, but refused to disclose what they could entail. He said Turkey intended to increase the Turkish navy's surveillance of the eastern Mediterranean, adding that parts of it were Turkey's "exclusive economic zones.""Until now, they were running wild in (the eastern Mediterranean). From now on, we will see Turkish ships more often especially in our exclusive economic zones," Erdogan said. "All the pros and cons of this have been calculated. We were present in these waters in the past, we are present today and we will continue to be present tomorrow."Turkey's main opposition has criticized Turkey's plans to increase navy patrols in the eastern Mediterranean, saying it could lead to a confrontation between Turkey and Israel.___Selcan Hacaoglu contributed to this report.

Funny how the Turks are complaining about Israel and something that happened over a year ago. But yet it seems as if all they want to do about their buddies to the south killing their own countrymen, (women and children included) is flap their gums.....

WTG Turkey! PM Erdogan is the ONLY world leader with balls big enough to stand up to the terrorist zionist entity. Netanyahu is going get a swift kick in his if he messes with Turkey.

How about Turkey apologizing to all the Kurds they slaughter off on a regular basis? All these Muslims do all day is accuse Israel and the US of all there problems as they shoot each other dead by the score.  Keep blaming your favorite scapegoats, Islamic fascist, and keep killing each other.

Why Isra.ill can't keep any deal to that matter; nothing new Mr.Erdogan!

Ask the Palestinian negotiators; for 20 yrs they've been trying to reach a deal with the "Jewish" state to no avail.

"We don't care if it costs $15 million or $150 million," Erdogan said. "We will not allow anyone to walk all over our honor." What does this fool mean arabs dont have any honor anyway, their whole existance is built on lying, cheeting, and stealing all that they can from anyone including their muslem brouthers! The usless UN should close up shop and get out of the business of starting trouble!

Get your money back for the drones.  They probably have micro-chips that allow Israel to see whatever they want and to control the drones however THEY want.

Could it really be that difficult to make your own drone anyway?

'Turkey's sanctions against Israel — once a top military trading partner — follows a U.N. report into the flotilla raid, which accuses Israel of using excessive force, but also describes Israel's blockade of Gaza as legitimate.'

Follow the money trail. Turkey is guilty of aiding an illegal operation in the Mediterranean. That means they are culpable, and can be sued for the wrongful deaths.
They are standing up and frothing at the mouth because they don't want to fork over money for those deaths. Therefore they blame Israel for the fiasco of the flotilla. They hope that the UN changes the report so that Israel is totally to blame, so that they don't need to pay out.

But the timing is suspect. The flotilla debacle did not blow up until Turkey started bombing the Kurds IN IRAQ. They have killed Iraqi civilians in their incursions.

I believe that they are trying to draw attention away from their attacks on the Kurds, by raising a fuss about Israel.

Turkey is behaving like a rogue nation. Ever since they were given the snub by the EU and not allowed to join they've been demonstrating their true Muslim colors on full display with their saber rattling against Israel the only non-muslim nation in the Middle-East.

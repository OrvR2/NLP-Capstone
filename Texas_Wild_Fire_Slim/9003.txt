Spicewood fire is 90% contained

 | 

By Jacqueline Ingles and Dustin Blanchard at KXAN News, Austin
Officials said Wednesday morning that  the Spicewood fire is 90 percent contained, but assessment of the burned area is only 70 percent complete and still considered to be an active fire. The fire has burned for three nights and deputies continue to block access to Paleface Ranch Road and the Fall Creek subdivision, which is testing the emotions of area residents who want back in.
No cause of the fire has yet been determined, officials said.
Fire officials said Wednesday morning that a time has not been set for residents to return to their homes. The assessment must be 100 percent complete before they will be allowed in.
Pedernales Fire Department spokeswoman Mary Christopher said because the area has such rough terrain, firefighters cannot drive vehicles but must walk as much as one mile to assess the burn, which covers 6,400 acres and measures about two miles by five miles in size. She said they are “trying their hardest to complete the assessment today, but it will take time.”
Residents must go to Bee Creek Methodist Church, 3000 Bee Creek Road, to register and get wristbands which prove they live in the area. Residents must show identification and proof of residency to get the wristbands at the church. While wristbands are being issued Wednesday, officials want the public to be aware a time has not been announced for when residents will be allowed in.
Christopher said the most current updates will first be posted on the Pedernales Fire Department website and that residents should refer to it. The fire was formerly known as the Pedernales fire.
Dozens of folks drove up to the roadblock early Wednesday, only to be turned away. Many more picked up wristbands and car tags for when the neighborhoods eventually reopen.
In another area of the city, Ray Johnson came home to find his yard completely blackened, but his home untouched. “Embers didn’t jump up on the house and start the roof on fire or anything. We got really lucky. honestly, we got really lucky,” said Johnson.
Tracks from a fire truck could be seen across his scorched lawn. He said he is extremely thankful for their efforts. “They’ve worked their tails off. They’ve done great,” he said. “With all they’ve had to do, you can’t ask any more of them.”
The fire damaged or destroyed 67 structures in Fall Creek and off of Paleface Ranch Road. Firefighters do not know how many of those structures are houses.

Mookie: Amazing.  Hat's off to y'all!  Stay safe....Kim Gillihan: Thanks to your brother and all other fighting these fires!Fookie: Darla - I don't know the circumstances surrounding the offer of assistance by these good men.  However, it is very unusual for anyone to walk on to the scene of an emergency without belonging to an organization such as a CERT group or emergency service provider.  I hope these men will take the opportunity to join up with a local fire department, EMS provider or disaster service like Red Cross so that their expertise can best be utilized.Fookie: Texas-Fire does its best to provide accurate information that we glean from various sources.  The above story comes from KLTV, KYTX and www.cbs19.tvFookie: Try these links.  Second one is a good map.

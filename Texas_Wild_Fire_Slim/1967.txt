Chicago Catholic church to expose abusive priests: attorneyBy Andrew Stern | Reuters – Mon, Aug 29, 2011






CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago's Catholic archdiocese will allow dozens of former priests accused of child sexual abuse to be identified as part of a settlement that moves the church closer to naming all offending clergy, a lawyer for abuse victims said on Monday.
The undisclosed financial settlement with the nation's third-largest diocese on behalf of 12 abuse victims promises to identify as many as 35 former diocesan priests as offenders, a significant advance in the protection of children, attorney Jeff Anderson said.
"This establishes a strict protocol for the review of every file" the diocese has on abusive priests, said Anderson, who has worked on more than a hundred abuse cases involving the Chicago archdiocese and collected some $50 million in settlements.
"This protocol, if implemented, is on the front end of the child protection movement," Anderson said.
Boston's archdiocese, where the priest abuse scandal broke a decade ago, set a new standard for transparency last week when it published the names of 159 accused clergy.
The Chicago archdiocese already lists 65 former clergy credibly accused of sexual abuse. Anderson said he has brought cases involving roughly half of them.
Among those identified as part of the settlement was former priest Joseph Fitzharris, who was defrocked in 1991 but still lives in Chicago. Like many accused clergy, he has not been criminally charged in part because the abuses occurred long ago and the statute of limitations has expired, Anderson said.
Angel Santiago, a father of two who still wears a cross around his neck, told reporters he was abused by Fitzharris when he was 12 and 13 but suffered in silence until after his father and sister died.
Santiago's father loved his job as custodian at Fitzharris' church though the priest fired him in a move Santiago said he believes was punishment for his own absence from the church to avoid the priest.
"I'm here to protect kids," Santiago said of the importance to him of naming offending priests. "I'm not afraid anymore."
Fitzharris could not be reached for comment.

Yeahright, believe me I am not defending them.  I want the real monsters put under the jail.  I want, no, I demand that ALL  molesters be exposed and prosecuted. But condemning the innocent along with the guilty is useing Hitler's methods.  It is everywhere not just in religious institutions.  When you get as close to death as I have been you know that there is a God, but God doesn't run the religious places, people do and people are flawed.  Don't blame God for what people do.

I'm so sick of seeing religious sexual abusers in our headlines! Warren Jeffs- baby raper and mass manipulator, SC Baptist Preacher- raping women behind the church, Catholic priest- obsessed with raping little boys and then covering it all up! It's in ALL religions and it's disgusting! I dont see how anyone could bring their children to listen to these men who profess to be "god-like"!

OK,  we all know that anyone who molests children  sholud be boiled in oil, but did you know that of all the priests accused of these crimes,only a small percent of the charges have been proved to be true ?  Jerks want to get on the money bandwagon and cash in.  Let's get the real offenders and stop wasting time condemming the entire institution .  There are perverts in every single institution and profession. Do you throw out the good with the bad ? Use your anger to get laws passed  that stop this abuse.  If you can find an honest politician, get a movement going that stops the pay off and send these guys to jail.  Spending millions of dollars to pay off the abused does not solve the problem.

WTF? "Catholic archdiocese will ALLOW dozens of former priests accused of child sexual abuse to be identified". They shouldnt have EVER had a say so on if they are ALLOWED to be identified or not! SICKO RELIGIOUS BABY RAPERS! It should be tatooed on their foreheads while they rot in prison!

We can only file charges to guilty priests but not the Roman Empire Vatican. Now tell what happened to that case about charging the Vatican -- mwaaa none. Guilty priests should be sentence to the full extent of the law. Electrocution or lethal injection i suggests. A more brutal punishment is to be crucified or stoned to death. I told you before to mark my words. You can never bring down the greatest empire on earth - especially that the Mother Church is very much have changed to something good... but i think the bible is still mythical...mwahahahha.. hear that?!!!!

Funny how people from other religions make believe it doesn't happen in their church, synagogue or mosque. 
Maybe religion is the root of all evil.

The bottom line (no pun intended) is the Vatican thinks child rape is quite normal.

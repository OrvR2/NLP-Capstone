Religion News Service
WASHINGTON (RNS) Americans consider religious freedom a cornerstone of society, but fall short in their tolerance of Muslims, according to a poll released Tuesday (Sept. 6) that probes Americans' attitudes toward immigrants and the nation's safety 10 years after 9/11.
The "What It Means to Be American" poll found that a small majority (53 percent) say the country is safer now than before the 9/11 attacks. Attitudes toward Muslims, however, are far less straightforward.
More than 8 in 10 Americans say that self-proclaimed Christians who commit violence in the name of Christianity are not really Christians. By contrast, less than half (48 percent) say that self-proclaimed Muslims who commit acts of violence in the name of Islam are not really
Muslims.
"Interestingly, we find that Americans basically have a double standard when it comes to evaluating religious violence," said Robert P. Jones of the Public Religion Research Institute, which produced the survey with the Brookings Institution.
On the same question, disparities arose among political and religious groups.
Republicans (55 percent) were more likely to call the perpetrator of a violent crime in the name of Islam a Muslim than were Democrats (40 percent). At 57 percent, white evangelicals were far more likely to consider the perpetrator a Muslim than were Catholics (39 percent) or black Protestants (36 percent).
In general, the survey of 2,450 adults paints Americans' attitudes toward Muslims as a complex picture of acceptance and wariness.
Nearly nine in 10 Americans agree that "America was founded on the idea of religious freedom for everyone, including religious groups that are unpopular." And by a 2-to-1 margin, Americans reject the idea that Muslims want to establish Islamic law, or Shariah, in the United States.
But they are divided as to whether Islam is at odds with American values, with 47 percent agreeing and 48 percent disagreeing.
The poll's authors likened this ambivalence about American Muslims to the evolution of attitudes toward Catholics, who were once widely suspected for their loyalty to the pope, and Mormons, once widely reviled for their religious practices.
Brookings scholar William A. Galston said Muslims are now testing the nation's tolerance, particularly as they try to build mosques.
"The siting of Muslim houses of worship has become the object of great controversy, which really goes right at the heart of religious free exercise," he said.
The survey also notes differing attitudes toward Muslims between generations, with more than 6 in 10 young Americans (ages 18 to 29) reporting comfort with several expressions of Muslim religious practice, compared to fewer than 4 in 10 senior citizens.
The report uncovered more ambivalence on immigration, and concluded that prospects for immigration reform face steep obstacles.
A slim majority (53 percent) takes a positive view of the influence of immigrants on American society; 42 percent said the growing number of newcomers threatens American values.
And while 51 percent of Americans said the nation should make a serious effort to deport all illegal immigrants, when asked a more nuanced question, a majority seemed to oppose such a policy.
Asked whether they favor an immigration plan that combines enforcement with deportation, or a plan that combines enforcement with a path to citizenship, 62 percent preferred to combine enforcement with a path to citizenship.
On race, nearly half of Americans (including 51 percent of whites) believe that discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against minority groups. About 3 in ten blacks and Hispanics agree.
The biggest differences in perceptions about discrimination emerged between those who most trust Fox News and those who most trust public television, with nearly seven in 10 Fox News fans saying that so-called reverse discrimination is as big a problem as traditional discrimination, compared to less than one in four public television viewers.
Among the poll's other findings:
Ninety-five percent of Americans believe all religious books should be treated with respect, no matter the religion.
Acceptance of Mormons continues to lag behind other minorities, with 67 percent expressing favorable views of Mormons, compared to 84 percent for Jews and 83 percent for Catholics.
16 percent of Americans believe that people in Muslim countries have a favorable view of the United States.
The survey of 2,450 adults had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

																Is our top priority trying to do away with religion altogether, or is it trying to make the world a better place? If it is the latter, then we must change our approach, reach out to religious liberals and moderates and work together.

				Iran just executed three men for homosexual activity. Honor killings are encouraged­, women are treated like farm animals, stoning and whipping is common and in Gaza, children are born specifical­ly to become a suicide bombers. While the world condems and vilifies Hitler for what he did to the Jews, no one seems to remember Islam has vowed to finish what he started or that they were his Middle Eastern buddies during WW2, and all done in the name of their religion.  
What part of tolerence are they displaying­? Why should anyone be tolerant when they are judge, jury and literal executione­r to anyone who disagrees with them? There is more than "religion" and "tolerance­" going on here. Tolerance is a two way street. If they can not give it, they can not expect it. Only a fool will believe in something standing in front of the mountain of contrary evidence.

				People living in glass houses! The society we live in isn’t exactly a model for others to follow. No more, if it ever was. This despite the fact that it has never had to live under occupation by a foreign power since it became a nation.

Others can and do present facts about America in a non flattering perspectiv­e. Domestic violence is common. Rapes happen once every few seconds. There have been several serial killers. 3% of the entire population is in the prison system. Education is shambling along. Corporate greed has nearly destroyed the economy. Infrastruc­ture has been neglected. Roads are in disrepair and bridges are crumbling.

Should we be sending soldiers abroad and spending billions to spread “democracy­” abroad when the political system back home is so polarized and deadlocked that it seems unable to discern the needs of the people.

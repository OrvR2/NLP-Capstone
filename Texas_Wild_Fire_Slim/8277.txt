Uribe accused of paramilitary tiesBy CAMILO HERNANDEZ - Associated Press | AP – 6 hrs ago





BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — A leftist Colombian congressman presented video testimony Wednesday from a jailed far-right militia chief who accuses former President Alvaro Uribe of sponsoring his illegal armed group in the mid-1990s.In the video, Pablo Hernan Sierra says he organized a militia that operated from the Guacharacas ranch owned by Uribe's family in the northwestern state of Antioquia in 1996 when Uribe was the state's governor.Rep. Ivan Cepeda said the video was recorded last month when he visited the prison where Sierra is imprisoned for murder. Cepeda's aides said Sierra was convicted of killing an indigenous leader but they could not immediately provide details.Uribe is widely hailed for major security gains against leftist rebels during his 2002-10 presidency, and Sierra is the first former paramilitary leader to directly accuse him of sponsoring the illegal militias responsible for most killings in Colombia's long-running dirty war.Uribe has long denied any links to paramilitaries and on Wednesday accused Cepeda via Twitter of "desperately seeking more calumnies" against him.In the video, Sierra does not say whether he personally spoke with Uribe or saw the former president give orders to militiamen.He does give an explanation, however, for why the paramilitary band was allegedly created: A leftist rebel leader had stolen 600 head of cattle from the ranch as well as mules and horses including one "paso fino" horse prized by Uribe, which incensed him.Cepeda, who said he turned the video over to Colombia's chief prosecutor, Viviane Morales, acknowledged that Sierra is seeking a reduced sentence."I believe the time has come that the country launches an investigation into former President Alvaro Uribe for the presumed creation of paramilitary groups and for criminal acts that these groups committed in Antioquia and in many other places across the nation," Cepeda said at a news conference.Colombia's paramilitary groups were first formed in the 1980s to protect ranchers and drug traffickers from leftist rebel extortion. They later evolved into murderous criminal gangs that prosecutors estimate committed more than 50,000 killings.This is not the first time allegations have been made that a right-wing death squad operated from Guacharacas.Another leftist lawmaker, then-Sen. Gustavo Petro, made a similar accusation in 2007. And last year, a former police major who worked in the region in 1994 told The Associated Press that Uribe's younger brother, Santiago, ran a death squad from Guacharacas during that time.The former police officer, Juan Carlos Meneses, said Santiago Uribe paid him to allow the death squad to operate and estimated it killed at least 50 people.Santiago Uribe denied the accusations, and Meneses said he had no evidence that Alvaro Uribe had any knowledge of the illegal militia.When Alvaro Uribe was governor he openly supported civilian self-defense groups known as "Convivir" that human rights groups accused of death squad activity.Uribe's father was slain by rebels in 1983.Cepeda's father, a communist senator, was assassinated a decade later by a death squad that included two soldiers.___Associated Press writer Frank Bajak in Lima, Peru, contributed to this report.

This accusation has been made against Uribe for years, but, the accusers have never have come up with concrete, reliable evidence or trustworthy sources.  The fact is that the LA Times had an article in which they interviewed the spokespersons for the white house, defense department and prior ambassadors from the US to Colombia during the governments of Bush Sr, Clinton, Bush Jr and Obama and all of them rejected the accusations against Uribe.  They said that if they had found one shred of evidence that Uribe had ties with criminal elements, the US will rejected his US Visa.  Samper, prior president of Colombia was rejected his visa for entering the US, for his obvious ties to drug cartels, while still president.  Clinton, Bush Sr, Bush Jr and Obama, at one time or another have praised Uribe for his great achievements in bring Colombia out of the abysm where it was. The US government gave Uribe the most prestigious medal that the US can give "the medal of freedom."  Of course, I will trust the opinions of these US representatives over that of a comunist and guerilla sympathizer and or a convicted member of the militia.

The credibility and trustworthyness  of both this congressman  Cepeda and the rightwing milital leader is like believing a pedophile when he says he is not.  Cepeda, has been a long time enemy of Uribe.  He is a comunist and his father was a member of the FART terrorist group.  Even today, the FART has named one of their fronts after Manuel Cepeda, father of ivan cepeda. Uribe sent over 30 rightwing militia leaders to jail.  Of course, they are upset at Uribe, they want revenge.  They are looking for a reduction in jail term and even exile in Europe in exchange for making false accusations.  Cepeda's credibility went really bad, when he tried to say that the Macarena site was a mass grave for which he was blaming Uribe.  He even went so far as to include photos of the mass graves in Serbia as if they were Macarena.  The UN did an invetigation and found it to be all totally false.  Cepeda, to date has refused to apologize for lying and fabricating Macarena mass grave.  Uribe, still enjoys 85% approval from Colombians while Cepeda is one of the most disliked among Colombians.

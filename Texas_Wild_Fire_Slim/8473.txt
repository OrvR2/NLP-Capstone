U.S. sets ultimatum in Swiss bank tax dispute: reportsBy Emma Thomasson | Reuters – Sun, Sep 4, 2011

ZURICH (Reuters) - The United States has written to Switzerland to demand it hands over detailed information this week on its citizens using Swiss accounts to dodge tax or see Credit Suisse and nine other banks face charges, newspapers reported on Sunday.
The letter, quoted by two Swiss Sunday papers, was sent by U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 31 and demands detailed figures on tax evasion at Credit Suisse by Tuesday and also seeks information from nine other smaller Swiss banks.
In the letter, Cole demands that Switzerland quickly deliver a significant number of client accounts, the SonntagsZeitung reported, adding that U.S. authorities are also ready to examine a Swiss offer to settle the dispute.
Mario Tuor, a spokesman for the Swiss department for international financial affairs, would only say that Switzerland was in contact with the United States but declined to comment on the letter.
"We are seeking a solution on the basis of existing laws," he said.
Switzerland last month made a proposal to try to kickstart talks to settle its impasse with U.S. authorities, offering to hand over data on groups of clients under a pending new bilateral tax treaty despite strict bank secrecy.
A long tradition of bank secrecy has helped Switzerland build up a $2 trillion offshore financial industry, but the country has agreed in recent years to do more to help hunt tax cheats amid a global crackdown on tax havens.
US SEEKS THOUSANDS OF CLIENT NAMES
The United States is pushing for Switzerland to hand over thousands more bank client names as it did last year when it allowed UBS to bend bank secrecy and reveal the details of around 4,450 clients to avoid criminal charges.
"They won't be contented with less than in the UBS case," former U.S. Justice Department investigator Peter Henning told the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper.
He added that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service felt betrayed because many UBS clients had shifted their assets to smaller Swiss banks rather than declaring them.
The SonntagsZeitung quoted Swiss sources close to the talks as saying Washington is seeking details of all U.S. clients with accounts worth at least $50,000 between 2002 and 2010 at banks including Credit Suisse, private banks Julius Baer and Wegelin as well as the Zurich and Basel cantonal banks.
That could imply tens of thousands of accounts, the paper said, far more than Switzerland could deliver under a double taxation agreement with the United States that it approved in 2009 but is still awaiting ratification by the U.S. Senate.
Switzerland is keen to find a solution that would not need approval from parliament, seen as likely to block any new breach of bank secrecy after only reluctantly agreeing to the UBS treaty under emergency law last year.
If Switzerland does not comply, the United States could issue a subpoena against the banks to force them to hand over data, as it did in the case of UBS, the SonntagsZeitung and NZZ am Sonntag reported.
"This will be much more expensive as with UBS that had to pay a fine of $780 million," one banking source told the SonntagsZeitung. "We expect that the Swiss banks will have to pay a fine of up to 2 billion Swiss francs ($2.6 billion) and deliver much more client data than in the UBS case."
Henning said the United States would probably launch criminal charges against a smaller Swiss bank rather than Credit Suisse as it was too critical to the global financial system.
Last month, Switzerland struck deals with Germany and Britain to tax money kept by their residents in secret Swiss accounts and also introduce a withholding tax on future interest earned, a proposal rejected by Washington.

The message: Loud and Clear.

Successful people: The USA hates you.

The ONLY country in the world to claim WORLD WIDE taxation of their citizens money is the USA.  Any other country only taxes you on money you make or possess in the country.  The arrogance of the US govt. to try to take their citizens money, via taxes, no matter what country they live in or make their money in.  Talk about BIG BROTHER trying to grab you from beyond the border.

Hey, have you heard Obama's latest decree??  every time anyone  any bank does a transaction, a fee of 1% must be charged against the account doing the transaction.  That means if you are banked, every deposit, withdrawal, card charge, debit card purchase, tax payment, or anything else must pay a 1% fee.  That means that if you get a direct deposit of $1000,00 from Social Security every month, you have to pay $10.00, then every time you use that money to pay bills, you have to pay 1%.  That means that if you use that entire $1,000.00 to pay bills with you wind up paying $20.00 to the federal government as a tax every month.  Congress voted this down but Obama did an "executive decree" (basically a ROYAL DECREE) and now it is a law.  

Now you history buffs,  What was the reason for the American Revolution??  could it be, NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION??   Mr. President, you need to understand that you are a president and NOT A KING!!  Hell, most kings that I ever heard about have some class, you have none.

The lesson here is, if you want to keep your money safe from a greedy fat govt. you should pick a country like China and park your money in the Bank Of China. Then see if the good ole USSAA can bully the Chinese. Heh heh..

This makes me sick.  I wonder what would happen if say any of our "allies" decided to sue the U.S. Government for freezing the assets and money they have on deposit in the United States??  One of these days, the IRS and the United States Treasury, in their Progressive and Liberal GREED will place the United States in the position of being a pariah nation IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY!!  There is no more freedom here!!  No wonder there is a brain drain and a monetary drain from this country.  It is Political greed pure and simple.  The only way to fix it is to replace Congress, The Senate and the Executive branch entirely,  to begin with and then do away with at least half of the bureaucracy and re write the tax code down to a point where it takes less than two months to read and less than two years to understand.

Can you blame a person for cheating on his taxes when he knows the government will take it away form him and give it to illegals, welfarites, and cheating politicians? Paying taxes for the necessary function of government is one thing, but paying people to sit on their arses and letting the politicians rob us is another thing

And if the banks dont comply?  Are we going to go in and seize them?  Are we gonna sneak in kidnap and extradite the bankers to the US for trial?  Are we gonna start another war?  How much of a bully do we get to become before the entire world (not just the middle east) starts to HATE us? 
Threatening a friendly nation is not diplomacy.  It is a precurser of war.  Maybe Switzerland will let us get away with it because they are a small country, but the rest of the world is watching.  And they see how we treat our enemies and our allies.

Taxation is done coercively! Just try to evade them! The government takes from us, is stingy about giving it out, except for war and elections, politician's pay, and other money wasting research and porkbarreling!!  They have the gall to think that the money they TAKE from us, is theirs!!!!!!!!!!!!

The operative word is "confiscatory". Now that the politicians have squandered the country into a black hole of debt, they will strip away as many assets of the citizens as they possibly can get their hands on, piece by piece. They are already eyeing ways to REQUIRE pension funds to purchase government Treasury Bonds, so they can get their hands on pension fund money. And check out the laws on "civil forfeiture" -- the government can take your house, your car, and everything you own without even bringing charges against you, let alone convicting you of a crime. Inflation -- called "the hidden tax" -- gives the government more money while leaving the citizens with debased currency that buys less and less. The whole system is a gigantic criminal enterprise which would leave the Founding Fathers of this country aghast with horror. Read "The Creature From Jekyll Island".

Funny all these Liberals pretend that the "Rich" are all Republicans. Actually quite the opposite. People like Bill Gates, Lee Scott, George Soros, Peter Lewis, John Stryker and ohh yea Barack Obama to name a small few. Nice try Libs. One more lie debunked.

If the Swiss don't cooperate we should cut off their foreign aid!  Oh ..., well then, close all of our military bases there and cancel our military defense treaties with them.  Oh ..., well, refuse to send them any hurricane or earthquake relief.  OK, if they don't enforce US laws we should treat them the same as we do Mexico for not protecting our borders.   Uhhh - naval blockade?
Ok, ok - outlaw swiss cheese; it is defective anyway (full of holes).

The answer is not suing Swiss Banks. It is in adopting a national sales tax or a simple flat tax.

This really gets me. The United States Attorney Generals office "DEMANDING" that the Swiss give up these accounts. This is almost laughable. If I were the Swiss I would tell the USA to go shove its head where the sun don't shine. What a Crock

Who ever these rich maggots are that dodge their taxes should be published in ever news paper in the USA. Then tried and found guilty. Then sent to prision. Our country is at war.

Guess I am pretty dumb, but I wonder how the US government can force the banks of another country to do anything....Not that I disagree with the plan, but there is room for wondering. If Switzerland was Russia or China, would they still pursue those private accounts with this much energy.....Probably not, as the US would be told to stick it up where the sun doesn't shine.

BRC, DJ, P2A.
Honestly, I already answered your questions through my previous posts. But it seems that you've give too much leverage on writing and speech that there's less or nothing left for reading and listening comprehension/understanding.
I'm sorry to tell you that I'm strict with my students and I don't sp-o-on-fe-ed them but since you're not my students, I could be a little lenient by giving you a clue.
BRC- Try to focus on the 1st paragraph 2nd sentence and 3rd paragraph last line.
DJ- The entire first paragraph
P2A- Do the same with BRC
Kindly read again (and this time) using the little amount of ozzing thing inside left inside your craniums.
Just in case that thing at the end of your neck lacks the capability to decipher it still.  Just do what Hooviles did that maybe I would become lil bit more generous to scoop it into your mouths that you may feast some knowledge.
@Hoorviles...
There are a lot of things that you need to consider in conceptualizing the context of the bible.
Let me give at least 3 things to consider:
First- if the words and commandment really came from God OR only from prophets and other characters in the bible
Second- if the things that happened are commanded by or will of God, OR just by human's stupidity.
Third- Also consider the the chronological order of events.
To address your concern:
"God sends angels down to save Lott (the righteous) from destruction."
"Lott (the righteous) offers his two v-i-r-g-i-n daughters to the unruly crowd"
Let me ask you two two things here: 
1.)Which of the two events occured first? The act was absolutely immoral and unrighteous. Should the act occured first, apparently, God would rather send the two angels to gather sticks and play swords man than saving Lot.
2.)Did God commanded Lot to offer his two virgins? You should be the one provide the answer and the verses if there is.
To answer your question:
The answer is NO, it wasn't "OKAY", there's nowhere in the Bible that God himself says it was. Lot as chosen by God as the most moral man lived (at least in Sodom and Gomorrah) doesn't necessarily mean that anything he do or say is "OKAY" for God.
As to lot's morality is concern, you should take into consideration that Lot lived in the place where wh-o-re-do-ms,wi-ckedne-ss and all sort of abomination reigns. 
If it surprised you that Lot was chosen as the most moral and righteous person in that place, you better watch the movie "Idiocracy" to see the connection.
"Since you are such a biblical scholar, here is your chance to shine."
Thanks for the compliment but I far way off of becoming one. To truly comprehend what really the Bible is; what it say; and what it's purpose doesn't require much of intellect.  It only takes belief, faith, humility, prayers (for enlightenment to find the truth though its hard) and a dash of common sense that most (if not all) of you atheist lack of.
And I didn't come in this blog to shine nor to convince people but to share the knowledge revealed unto me. Should you believe it or not, I simply could care less. 
PS. to DJ...Sorry but I also could care less to those "38,000" spoiled brats if they couldn't meet in the park for a group date. I have an awesome date of my own.

The fact that you don't care that your bible is worthless as a guide to your god's will, should be important to you.  Your thoughts on the bible being the word of god or containing the word of god is just your opinion.  The 38,000 other denominations all have opinions based on the same bible.  Worthless.
But, I bet you feel your god, in your heart!  As I pointed out to Herbie, it is just brain chemistry. All the other believers – even believers in other gods –  experience the same feelings.
What is your proof that you are correct and everyone else who does not share your beliefs are wrong?  What is your proof that your Christian god is the one true god?
Cheers!
Cheers!

Hoovervilles,
Congrats for persevering - good post.
p.s. From a quick look, I think it was probably alt.itudes that was kicking it out.

Yes it was. I completely missed it, so much so that I was trying several even though they seemed pretty innocuous. 
Thanks for the hints.

I have a puzzler for you. You donât have to answer, just think about it.
Regarding Noahâs Ark,
1)	How did the m-a-r-s-u-p-i-a-l-s on the isolated island continent of Australia make it to the ark? How about the flightless Kiwi?
2)	How did the Silver Sword plants that inhabit high a-l-t-i-t-u-d-e-s on Mt Haleakala make it to the ark? Since these plants cannot survive at sea level, how was their environment controlled? Were there air conditioners?
3)	How were the dinosaurs herded, fed and stalls cleaned?
4)	How were the salt water and fresh water fish simultaneously saved?
5)	In D-e-a-t-h Valley CA, there are P-u-p Fish that only survive in highly saline water and hot temperatures. How did they make it to the ark and how was their environment maintained? Maybe they had their own air conditioner.
6)	Since the flood was a new covenant erasing all past sins, why were all the forms of pestilence saved?
7)	How were the T â s â e â t â s – e fly, mosquitos, etc. maintained and separated from the rest of the animals.  I guess they were in glass containers; Oooo wait, glass was not around then.  How were nasty biological things like E-b-o-l-a, A-n-t-h-r-a-x, E-c-o-l-i, etc contained? What kind of biological protection suit was used to protect the people from these?
As one can imagine this is but a small list of puzzlers regarding the Ark.

The emoticon came from your 8 + right-parenthesis  in your numbering system.
Now you can be cool anytime you want to

Penguins and polar bears would have been interesting, as well.  How long did it take the British Navy to sail to the Falklands?  Imagine how long it would take a polar bear to swim from the North Pole!  Longer than 40 days.  LOL!

Another good one is Jonah and the Sea Serpent (later changed to Whale). In either case, I find it all hilariously entertaining.

I tried posting this already, but apparently the filter is tripping on something. I am trying hyphenating some words. We will see.
Hopefully this makes it and the other attempts do not.
Here goes.

I give up. I do not know what is tripping this up. Will seek someone who has much more experience than I.
Thanks for you patience with this post.

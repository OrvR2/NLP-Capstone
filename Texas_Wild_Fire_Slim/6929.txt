Debate Winners: Romney, Bachmann, Tea Party
Rick Perry-bashing pays off for rivals

(Newser) -
                                    It was "attack Rick Perry night" at last  night's GOP debate in Florida -—to the extent that even Jon Huntsman got in on the act—and the Texan's rivals succeeded in landing a few blows. Mitt Romney, who wisely ignored the Tea Party debate audience to...

Romney Energy Aide Linked to Coal Industry
Jim Talent runs lobbying firm paid by Big Coal

(Newser) -
                                    An energy advisor who helped craft Mitt Romney's pro-coal policy also runs a lobbying firm that's paid by, you guessed it, a big coal company. Ex-Missouri senator Jim Talent co-chairs the lobbying firm Mercury Public Affairs, which receives $125,000 a year from Peabody Energy to promote its...

(Newser) -
                                    Tim Pawlenty didn’t wait long to throw his weight behind a candidate in the GOP primary race. The former Minnesota governor told  Fox News  today that he is endorsing Mitt Romney, adding, “I think he’s going to be a transformational and great president for this country.”...

Social security and Tea Party topics likely to be big issues

(Newser) -
                                    Yes, it’s debate time again.

And the Winner Is ... Mitt Romney (Mostly)
His steady performance seems to make him the consensus pick over Perry

(Newser) -
                                    A consensus is taking shape from last night's GOP debate, and Mitt Romney should be pleased. He won or at least held his own in the eyes of most (but certainly not all). Chris Cillizza of the  Washington Post  pronounces him the winner for his "slow and steady"...

Texas governor makes his presidential debate debut

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry made his debate debut tonight, and it's clear the new frontrunner is happy to mix it up.

Wall Street Journal Pans Romney's Job Plan
It's too timid, not conservative enough, editorial argues

(Newser) -
                                    Mitt Romney’s big list of  59 economic policy prescriptions  is a swing and a miss, as far as the famously conservative editors of the  Wall Street Journal  are concerned. “We’ll say this for it: His ideas are better than President Obama’s,” the editors write. But...

What to Watch for in Tonight's Debate
Will Perry make a good impression? Can Bachmann survive?

(Newser) -
                                    Sure, some of them have faced off before—but tonight’s Politico/NBC News debate marks the first time  new frontrunner Rick Perry  will join the fray, making it what  Politico  calls the “first Fall Classic” for 2012 GOP presidential hopefuls. And it’s the start of a busy month...

(Newser) -
                                    New poll results from the  Washington Post  and ABC have a familiar ring—Rick Perry is the frontrunner.

                                    With the GOP presidential candidates vying to be the rightest-of-the-right at yesterday's Freedom Forum in South Carolina, Mitt Romney kept focused on the general election, where wooing moderates is key, reports  Politico .

Jewish Donors Think Bachmann Is ... Jewish
And that's bad news for Mitt Romney's quest for cash

(Newser) -
                                    Michele Bachmann  likes to talk to crowds  about "the creator of the universe, our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ." Yet for some reason, some Jewish donors think she's ... Jewish. And what may be good for her campaign coffers is bad news for Romney's, according to the...

Group accuses President Obama of snub

                                    The VFW is not happy with President Obama: In what it's calling a first, the group’s annual convention this week will not feature a top-tier official from his administration. Obama himself addressed the VFW two years ago, and Joe Biden did so last year. This year the president...

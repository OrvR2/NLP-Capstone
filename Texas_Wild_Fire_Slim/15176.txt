News Corp. executive James Murdoch must have known that illegal phone hacking at the News of the World newspaper was not confined to the single journalist who was imprisoned for it, a former lawyer for the newspaper testified Tuesday.
Tom Crone, who was legal manager of the paper, said Murdoch would only have given Crone authority to settle a lawsuit against News of the World if he had understood that there had been more illegal eavesdropping.
Crone was one of four former executives grilled by British lawmakers as they try to determine whether Murdoch misled them about the scale of illegal eavesdropping at News of the World.

The paid contributors on Fox News have made this a mess of a country for profit.  I have never seen such disrespect heaped upon Democracy.  They have helped turn dialogue into the sewer.

The mere fact that no charges have been filed is proof of the power corporations hold over government.

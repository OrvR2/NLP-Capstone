Kate Gosselin




Kate Gosselin recently purchased herself an Audi TT sports car. Think it's an odd choice for a single mom of eight?

                 For most new parents, trading in the car they had pre-kids for something more reliable, spacious, practical, and less, well, cool, usually comes with the territory just like diaper changes and sleep deprivation. A zippy little sports car usually isn't an option again until junior is off to college and said parents become empty nesters.Except, that is, if you're mom of eight Kate Gosselin.The 36-year-old reality star (make that former reality star) recently went out and bought herself a brand new Audi TT. It's got leather seats, a turbo-charged engine, and can go up to 130 miles per hour. What it can't do is hold even a fraction of Kate's big brood in its miniscule back seat. Kind of an unusual choice for a single mom of 7-year-old sextuplets and 10-year-old twins, no?Photos: Hot Mamas


Kate's reality show, "Kate Plus 8" was recently canceled, and she's expressed concerns about finances.

You might be thinking, "Hey, if she's got the money, let her get whatever extra car she wants." Thing is, Kate's reality show "Kate Plus 8" (the spinoff of the TLC monster hit "Jon and Kate Plus 8" that began airing after she and Jon Gosselin divorced in 2009) was recently canceled. Since then, she's lamented to the media about financial woes. "People think we made gazillions of dollars, and we didn't," she said in a recent cover interview with People. "After the show was canceled, I said, 'I'll go back to my old nursing job.' If nothing comes up I'll do it. But the scary reality is, 12-hour nursing shifts every day wouldn't let me continue to provide well for eight kids essentially on my own. When you think about it that way, it gets really scary."Scary enough to go out and buy a small-but-gorgeous ride that averages in the $50,000 range? Our sympathy's waning, Kate ...More Celebrity Features on Yahoo!:Kate Gosselin Takes Kids to Get CutsFirst Kate, Now Kat: TLC CancellationsKate Vows to Ensure Kids' LifestyleFollow omg! on Twitter

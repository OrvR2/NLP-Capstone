CHICAGO, Sept. 2 (UPI) -- An Illinois woman carrying conjoined twins declines an abortion and says their fate is in God's hands.
Amanda Schulten of Marengo, a small town near the Wisconsin line, is a devout Catholic and refused to end her pregnancy, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. She has named the unborn girls Faith and Hope and is tracking her pregnancy in a blog, amanda-faithhopelove.blogspot.com. 
"He has a plan for me, and for them," she said. "We never know when our last day will be. We have to enjoy it, and appreciate health while we have it."
Schulten, who is single, learned on April 1 that she was carrying twins. A few days later she was told the twins were joined at the heart and had little chance of survival. Her doctor advised abortion.
The twins share most of their internal organs. One has not developed a lower body so they only have two legs between them. 
Schulten was hospitalized Monday and will remain at the University of Chicago Medical Center until her delivery.
She said the reaction she is getting to her blog is similar to the reaction from her family and friends when she first told them the facts of her pregnancy. Some support her decision, while others say she should terminate the pregnancy.

			Scientists tread carefully through a seemingly endless landscape of ice, sea, and meltwater in the Canada Basin of the Arctic on July 22, 2005. The blanket of ice coating Earth's northernmost seas was thin and ragged in July, setting a record low for sea ice extent for the month. Sea ice stretched across only 3.06 million square miles whereas the long-term July average is 3.9 million. Scientist note that this breakup of ice is a result of global warming.

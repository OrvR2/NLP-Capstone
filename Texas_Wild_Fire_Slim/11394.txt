A recent visit to NYC triggers memoriesPhotos from the 9/11 Memorial at Ground ZeroUpdated: Saturday, 10 Sep 2011, 4:58 PM CDTPublished : Sunday, 11 Sep 2011, 6:00 AM CDT
Josh Hinkle 

New York (KXAN) - When the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 happened, I was still asleep. As a sophomore at Oklahoma State University, I was taking advantage of the fact that my first class wasn’t until noon. One of my fraternity brothers shook me awake, spouting something about airplanes flying into buildings in New York City. I grabbed my cell phone to check the time and noticed I had several missed calls from my mom. Getting out of bed, I noticed several of my other fraternity brothers heading to the main room of the house where our television sat. Before I saw what was shown on the screen, I looked at their faces, some of them crying, all of them in shock. Last week – a decade later - another good college friend and I took a trip to New York City and visited the World Trade Center site. I took these photos  you can see in the this link , remembering that day and the emotion felt 1,500 miles away in my fraternity house. As a journalist, I’ve come close to many of the things others only see on television. For me, this view was truly one of the most humbling things I could ever experience.

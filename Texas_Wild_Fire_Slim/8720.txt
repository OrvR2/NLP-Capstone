Conn's revenue, earnings fall, but shares soarBy CHRISTINA REXRODE - AP Business Writer | AP – 15 hrs ago





NEW YORK (AP) — A quarterly net loss and declining revenue failed to stop a rally in shares of Conn's Inc., as investors snapped up shares of the electronics retailer after it announced it is taking steps to position itself for future profits.Beaumont, Texas-based Conn's said Wednesday it lost $3.4 million, or 11 cents per share, in the second quarter, which covered May to July, compared to net income of $1.6 million, or 6 cents per share, the year before.And revenue fell 13 percent to $184.4 million as the company sold fewer TVs and computers.However, the company, which caters to lower-income customers, emphasized that the loss was due to one-time charges. Those charges included $3.7 million for closing three stores and $11.1 million for repaying a loan earlier than expected.Without those items, the company would have earned $5.5 million, or 17 cents per share. That beat analysts' estimates for 4 cents per share.The company has also said that repaying the loan early will save it about $12 million a year in interest expenses.Conn's, with 71 locations in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, said it could still close more stores in the near future. The recently-shuttered stores were in areas where the average household income was nearly $100,000 per year, executives said, and Conn's targets households that make less than $50,000.The company had already announced last month that its retail sales would be lower in the second quarter, so investors were prepared for that bad news. Conn's has said that higher prices for electronics had scared away some customers. It has said that dry weather crimped sales of lawn and garden equipment such as tractors and mowers, and that it didn't have sufficient money for promotions and sales during the critical Memorial Day and July Fourth weekends.The company also detailed some of its plans for returning to profitability. It expects to open five to seven locations in new markets in 2012. It is devoting more floor space to better-selling — and higher-margin — furniture and mattresses. It's remodeling stores, and bringing more sales associates to the floor to boost revenue.Unlike most retailers, Conn's emphasizes rent-to-own programs and in-store financing, which usually appeal to lower-income customers or customers who can't qualify for credit from traditional sources. In the past three years, the company has financed about 60 percent of its retail sales.By some measures, that credit segment actually improved as customers repaid loans on time. For example, the percentage of loans that were between two and seven months late fell to 6.1 percent from 7.5 percent.But Conn's also noted that the improvement in charge-offs could actually hurt its interest income and servicing income. Executives said they're trying to attract more applications for credit through the Internet, though that could prove a risky proposition. The company acknowledged that those applicants tend to have lower credit scores.Conn's said it expects earnings per share of 65 to 75 cents this year, after excluding one-time items. That would handily beat analysts' current estimates for 45 cents per share.However, Conn's also said it expects revenue at stores open at least a year to be roughly flat through the end of January. That metric is a key indicator of a retailer's health because it excludes results from stores recently opened or closed.Conn's shares were up more than 35 percent in afternoon trading, to $7.35, making the company the second-biggest gainer on the Nasdaq by percentage. Wednesday's boost also means shares are up 57 percent since the beginning of the year.

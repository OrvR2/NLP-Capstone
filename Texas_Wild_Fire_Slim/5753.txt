Jon Stewart finally returned to "The Daily Show" after a two-week hiatus Tuesday night, and of all the juicy stories he missed out on mocking, he chose the one-day battle between President Obama and Congress known to some as "Speechgate" first.
In case you haven't heard, there's a big Republican debate being held tonight, Wednesday, the same night President Obama had originally planned to address both houses of Congress about the nation's biggest worry: jobs. The scheduling conflict was resolved, and the President will make his address on Thursday instead, but not before a huge blowout from 24-hour news networks across the board.
Thus, "Speechgate" was born. In the segment below Jon Stewart talks about the "manufactured controversy" and chides MSNBC's Ed Schultz and CNN's Wolf Blitzer particularly hard for discussing whether or not Obama "lost" by moving his speech (Stewart to Blitzer: "Are you f*cking insane?"). And don't even get him started on the questions asked by the White House Press Corps.
You can also hear about it from John Oliver's perspective in the second video below.

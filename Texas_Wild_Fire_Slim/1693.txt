Robo-signing practices have wreaked havoc across the housing market for some time now, allegedly even leading to wrongful foreclosures.
In Hawaii, though, a recent bank-related incident could best be described as robo-dialing. 
Bank of America reportedly pestered a grieving widow with up to 48 calls per day over a missed mortgage payment after her husband died, according to the Daily Mail. 
Deborah Crabtree of Honolulu, Hawaii, is now suing Bank of America for what she says were computer-generated calls from the bank as often as every 15 minutes, including during her husband's wake, according to the report. That despite her explaining that she would make the payment once she received her husband's life insurance pay out, according to paperwork filed in the lawsuit.
Crabtree's complaint is only the most recent automated mess in the financial industry. Take, for instance, the case of one man who was threatened with foreclosure for failing to pay an overdue balance of $0.00. Also common is confusion over the mortgage modification process, with  some being foreclosed on even while they were in the process of negotiating one.
Outside of the mortgage industry, banks have gotten themselves into trouble for technical errors, such as when Bank of America sent $30,000 worth of Social Security payments to the wrong person. Or consider that Chase reportedly had a man arrested for a check that they themselves had issued him. 
The automated phone calls for Crabtree remind of the aforementioned robo-signing practices, shorthand for a number of ways in which banks expedite the foreclosure-filing process. It's recently been made aware that the robo-signing practices date as far back as 1998, causing more than a few errors along the way. 
 Goldman Sachs, for one, recently agreed with a federal regulator to end robo-signing practices all together, on top of compensating some homeowners for wrongful foreclosures. 
On Tuesday, it was reported that major banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, have been offered a liability-limiting deal to settle claims of wrongful foreclosure practices -- specifically robo-signing -- in an exchange for an undetermined multi-billion dollar settlement.

				I can really relate to this article.  My husband passed in March. I closed our joint account, two months  later BOA credited the closed account $.03 in interest. Next month I was charged $12 for a too low account. I have gone to the bank each month since because now I am getting dunned for insufficie­nt funds. Each time I get one of these notificati­ons it opens the wounds all over again.

				I first was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2008, my mortgage was with the then Countrywid­e, I ask for and got a forbearanc­e. When the forbearanc­e was up I was told By Countrywid­e that I qualified for a Loan Modificati­on, which I agreed to. I was told not to make any payment until the loan modificati­on was compete, I was told it would take 30 to 45 days. 300 phone calls latter. BOA purchased Countrywid­e and everything Then took 3 years to complete loan modificati­on. I started and stop payments Twice, made over 11000.00 in payment which were not credited untill the closing... Needless to say they credited the money to Principal and Insurance and Then tacked the remaining to Principal which was 20000.00. So now I am paying interest on interest unless I can pay off my mortgage before then...We bought the home for 224000.00 put 48000.00 down with our principal balance of 180000.00. I now have a principal balance of 200000.00 .

				This woman must be going through a lot of pain, the loss of a loved one, and then the endless harassment by BoA. I remember about a year ago, when I was laid off from my prior job, and couldn't pay my expensive student loan debt for a few months. I remember getting calls almost every 15 minutes of the day, for 6 to 8 hours a day, by my student loan company (think female name for the first name, and last name is a month in spring/sum­mer). It was automated at first, and then they would actually have real call center workers call me. I explained to them my situation and told them to lay off of the calling, because they can't get blood from a rock, so to speak. I told them that I was laid off from my job where I actually worked at a call center handling Credit Cards Services for a very large Insurance company, that also does banking, and I told them to have some profession­al respect. Eventually they stopped calling. When I got my current job a few months after that, I paid off and am still paying off large amounts of my debt. I never sued them, and never wanted to sue them, I'm not a suing type of guy. I know it was my debt and my responsibi­lity, but some of these companies can be a little tactless.

				My wife has a mortgage with Wells Fargo...    they bought the mortgage from her previous bank.  Her rates were suddenly increased and we started getting threatenin­g phone calls.  She several times made the mistake of sending several mortgage payments in advance... with a note stipulatin­g what the payments were for. We got forclosure threats shortly after that.  They said that the extra money was applied to her principal rather than to the payments they were intended for... so she was still behind in her payments.   They really want to forclose, cuz similar condos in her area are selling for 350K... and she owes 70K.   They really work hard at trying to push you over the edge..  Not only that.. we gett assessed for legal fees   That's about 5K for every time their lawyer sends us a letter.  It's the American Dream, people!

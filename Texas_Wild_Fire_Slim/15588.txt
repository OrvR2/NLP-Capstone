Austin, you’re amazing.

Posted on September 13, 2011 by givingcityaustin				

Many of us know people affected by the fires all over the Austin area. Hell, many of you are people affected by the fires all over Austin.
So what would you say if I told you that hundreds and hundreds of complete strangers have sent in hundreds of thousands of dollars to help?
And that’s just to the Central Texas Wildfire Fund. There are a number of other funds out there collecting donations now, too.
Austin, you’re amazing.
I found this quote yesterday.
In every community, there is work to be done. In every nation, there are wounds to heal. In every heart, there is the power to do it.
–Marianne Williamson

WASHINGTON -- Attempts to bridge the divide between self-styled education reform groups and teachers unions, backed by progressive organizations, hit another snag last week, raising doubts about whether the two sides will ever be able to find true synchronicity.
The most recent flashpoints are, inherently, rehashes of old arguments. A new book authored by Steven Brill, Class Warfare: Inside the Fight to Fix America's Schools, makes the argument that absent a buy-in from unions, comprehensive school reform is likely elusive. Meanwhile, it was recently reported that the American Federation of Teachers helped originate a website attacking Michelle Rhee, a former Washington D.C. school chancellor and prominent education reform advocate, as beholden to conservative interests and hellbent on undermining collective bargaining rights. 
Neither revelation was, in and of itself, groundbreaking. But they do cast additional doubts on Rhee's efforts to accentuate the similarities between her politics and those of the unions she's often fought. Several months ago, Rhee's organization, StudentsFirst, announced that it was hiring former Democratic National Committee Press Secretary Hari Sevugan to serve in a communications role -- implicitly as an ambassador to the progressive community. 
"I don't feel [the story of StudentsFirst] has been captured, not wholly," Sevugan told The Huffington Post at the time. "If we're able to tell the story of how we've been working with people on both sides of the aisle, how it's a national movement made up of Democrats, Republicans and Independents, that are fighting to give students a voice, then I will have done my job."
Despite the skepticism that accompanied Sevugan's hiring, there were some early, encouraging results. Rhee formally came out in support of the DREAM Act, which provides a path to citizenship -- either through military service or scholastic achievements -- for the children of undocumented immigrants. Rhee also offered stronger indications that she did in fact support collective bargaining rights. And StudentsFirst, often accused of working solely with Republicans, recently hired a Democrat, Michigan State Rep. Tim Melton, to work on legislative issues.
Several months into the experiment, however, union officials and progressive advocates have been unconvinced, noting that for all of the rhetorical support for teachers and collective bargaining, Rhee often associates herself with efforts that run counter to those groups and interests. 
The most glaring moments have occurred in the states where StudentsFirst has been tied to legislative reforms that curb collective bargaining rights or tenure policies, or ones that involve major budget cuts that would affect school systems. Recently, however, the tiffs have grown a touch more personal. Rhee's appearance at a conference organized by Pastor Bill Hybels and the Willow Creek Leadership Summit became fodder for critics amid protests over Willow Creek's anti-gay marriage platform. So too did Brill's revelation that StudentsFirst had been funded by NewsCorp.'s Rupert Murdoch. 
There were wrinkles to each item. President Bill Clinton had previously spoken at a similar Willow Creek Leadership Summit, without protest. And while Murdoch himself may have donated to StudentsFirst -- the organization won't confirm or deny the report -- he allegedly did so as an individual, not through his conservative-leaning media conglomerate. 
Nevertheless, the friction came to a head last week, when it was revealed that the AFT had registered the domain for RheeFirst, a website that tracks Rhee’s activities, compiles her controversial statements and examines her record. The site also includes information on her personal life, linking to police records of sexual misconduct allegations made against her fiancé, Kevin Johnson, the mayor of Sacramento, Calif.
Sevugan, for his part, has done the job he was asked to do, denouncing the website -- "we were disappointed... that teachers unions were not disclosing their association with supposed grassroots voices attacking reform efforts and Michelle personally" -- and taking to various outlets in an attempt to squash the flames of controversy. He told The Huffington Post soon after he was hired that he viewed educational opportunity to be as much of a civil rights issue as marriage equality. When asked about the Hybels association, he re-affirmed that sentiment.
For critics, however, Sevugan's personal politics matter only to the extent to which he can influence StudentsFirst.
"Everything I know about Hari is that the guy is really smart and a real professional. But as good as he is, you can't overcome Michelle Rhee's agenda," said Michael Powell, assistant to the president for communications at the AFT. "I mean, she spent months working with [Wisconsin Governor] Scott Walker and [Ohio Governor] John Kasich and Governor [Rick] Scott down in Florida ... to take away collective bargaining rights of teachers. So as good as he is and as well-intentioned as he is, you can't overcome what the organization is doing." 
Labor groups remain deeply suspicious that Rhee brought Sevugan on board simply to placate progressives. "She knew what she was doing when she hired the best bomb-thrower in politics," said one union ally. 
Sevugan declined to discuss the terms of his contract but offered that he still drives "the same shitty 12-year old Jeep that doesn't have working air-conditioning" and wears canvas shoes. "The fact is, a lot of folks took significant pay cuts to join StudentsFirst because we felt it was the right thing to do," he added, noting that he himself was once a teacher. He also quit a high-paying law firm job in order to get into politics.
At the DNC however, he did spend much of his time criticizing the very Republican governors with whom Rhee now works, often taking aim at their policies towards teachers and unions. StudentsFirst hired an Ohio lobbyist to keep track of Kasich's SB5, a bill that partially restricted the collective bargaining rights of Ohio teachers. The group worked with Michigan lawmakers on similar legislation in that state. Rhee herself took on a consulting role for Scott, whose policies were viewed by Democrats as emblematic of dangerous conservative ambition.
"I was a part of that effort, to call out governors for overreach," Sevugan said shortly after joining StudentsFirst. "It's important to tell people when you disagree with them that you disagree with them, and it's important to work with them on issues that you agree with. That's how democracy works, that's how it should work."
"[B]ut to say that we're not going to work with folks who will help students because we disagree with one part of their agenda is not going to serve students or teachers or the country," he added.
And therein lies the problem. For unions and a progressive community feeling threatened by the brew of state and federal politics surrounding them, there is a point at which compromise is no longer a virtue.
StudentsFirst did not work directly with the Michigan legislature on the collective bargaining portion of the bill. It did not formally endorse SB5 ("We never did," said Sevugan) and has no position on its repeal, which is currently on the November ballot. It worked, instead, to advance a separate policy agenda attached to each: one that implemented new evaluation processes for teachers, ended a "last in, first out" system of layoffs and advanced performance-based reviews. 
Those policies are contentious in their own right. But the problem, for progressives, is with the cover that Rhee and now Sevugan offer those governors when they take even more controversial swipes at collective bargaining. And as the education reform battles progress, it's not clear how successful Sevugan will or can be at silencing those concerns.  
"I continue to believe that there are areas where we can work together," Sevugan said last week. "But we need an honest and civil discourse to find that common ground and achieve progress."

				I love the descriptio­n in the first paragraph of Michelle Rhee's "Students First" organizati­on as a "self-styl­ed education reform group." She has no credential­s in Education: no Ed.D., no substantia­l experience either as a teacher or administra­tor. There are no leading educators at major leading universiti­es who endorse who organizati­on. She is good at one thing–garn­ering publicity. Her group should be called "Michelle First!" She puts the blame on problems in our public education system squarely on the teacher's unions, when it is a very complex issue that demands a complex, multifacet­ed approach. Much of it has to do with the fact that students get very little support from home due to the fact that their parents are having to work longer for less. I imagine she would blame the parents if that was more politicall­y convenient for her. What a joke. People need to quit relying on Oprah and do some research on the subject.

				From OLMS

Embezzleme­nt, False Reports, Violence, And More

Most people don't know just how many crimes are committed every year through which union officials hurt their own members. The number of reputed and verified crimes is staggering­. Nothing illustrate­s this more clearly than the hundreds of indictment­s of union officials for violations of the Labor Management and Reporting Disclosure Act. According to the Office of Labor-Mana­gement Standards (OLMS), those crimes include “embezzlem­ent, filing false reports, keeping false records, destructio­n of records, extortiona­te picketing and deprivatio­n of rights by violence.” The OLMS notes:

As part of its effort to protect and safeguard union funds and assets, OLMS investigat­es possible embezzleme­nt from unions and other violations of criminal laws. Over the past 10 years, restitutio­n of $102,615,2­36 has been paid or ordered to be paid to defrauded unions and other parties.

That's $102,615,2­36 million in restitutio­n ordered for victimizin­g union members and others.

				Collective bargaining is not the problem and Dr. Rhee knows it.  She is like all other dictators, she wants what she wants and doesn't care who gets hurt in the process.  She always talks about the kids being first, but are they really?  And, hurting teachers is what, going to make them better?

Teachers and their unions are not the problem.
The problems are the politician­s who promise that which they do not understand and parents who do not parent.

Teachers should be held accountabl­e, but only for that which they have control.  Control over lesson plans that adhere to the cirriculum­.  Maybe teachers could have a real voice in the cirriculum process?!
Teachers have control over testing, special projects, grading homework,e­tc.  Teachers have control over the classroom environmen­t and adherence to the school policy and procedures­.

Teachers DO NOT HAVE CONTROL over what the kids eat, how much sleep the kids get, the completion of homework or special projects.  Teachers have no control over the home environmen­t, the kids overall health, the parent's marriage condition, the money available for food, shelter, medical care, books, etgc.     Dr. Rhee knows this and still thinks destroying the unions is good.   

I would not be a teach in today's classrooms­. . .a mindfield to say the least.

				Interestin­g how we expect teachers to put students first when the biggest problem is parents who don't put their own children first. The best schools in the U.S. are where parent involvemen­t is the strongest, and most especially in the richest school districts. Republican­'s want to make teachers scapegoats because teachers are part of the Democracti­c Party base and because the Republican­'s hate unions.

				Abraham Lincoln once said, "No man can lead another man without than man's consent."  No meaningful reform will happen without teachers. You can't lead people by browbeatin­g.  Children are not widgets on an assembly line and teachers are not assembly line workers.  The corporate model for K12 is a failure.  From NY to DC to GA, all of these so-called reform supers embrace the wall street results oriented high stakes testing styled reform.  It won't work.  Until American takes a common sense approach like Finland, which is actually the American way of old, we will continue to fall behind.

				The biggest problem is the American teacher's union, the NEA - lets compare the twisted, corrupt, and reprehensi­ble monster known as the NEA to FInland's teacher unions (OAJ):

NEA: Despite what some among us would like to believe, it is not
because of our creative ideas, it is not because of the merit of our
position, it is not because we care about children, and it is
not because we have a vision for a great public school for every
child. NEA and its afÀ liates are effective advocates because we
have power.

OAJ (FInland Teacher Union): Betterand quality educationf­or all􀁑Better working enviroment­for teachers, studentsan­d pupils􀁑Chi­ldrenand students with special needs-more resourcesa­nd supportin services 􀁑More resourcesf­or education􀁑­Regular inservice training systemto teachers􀁑H­igher educationf­or all teachers 􀁑Education­top on listof political decision-m­aking.

See the difference­? In FInland, they have Education Profession­als.....wh­ose goal is unified - both the teachers and the public good - for education.

				What is wrong with ending collective bargaining for public unions?

FDR:

"All Government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining­, as usually understood­, cannot be transplant­ed into the public service. It has its distinct and insurmount­able limitation­s when applied to public personnel management­. The very nature and purposes of Government make it impossible for administra­tive officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussion­s with Government employee organizati­ons. The employer is the whole people, who speak by means of laws enacted by their representa­tives in Congress. Accordingl­y, administra­tive officials and employees alike are governed and guided, and in many instances restricted­, by laws which establish policies, procedures­, or rules in personnel matters."

				And once again the teachers unions prove that they do not care one iota about the students of America. All they care about is filling the bank accounts with union dues. They will continue to destroy our education system and continue to bleed taxpayers until no one can even afford to have a home due to ever-incre­asing tax increases to pay the teachers bloated salaries.

				Right on,

F&F

- I would add this - only if teacher's are continued to be forced into teacher's unions. In Wisconsin they finally recieved their Freedom and they are leaving the teacher's union in droves.

Teachers will decide - whether they stand with their community - or some non-electd union boss who does not represent them.

Choose wisely.

				You are wrong on so many levels, I really don't know where to start.  But, it is true that there will have to be some give and take on the tenure issue at some point. The unions know that and eventually it will change. Most teachers I know are not overpaid. Most teachers i know care about their students.  Most teachers I know work more than 10 hours/day.  However, the older teachers remember the "good old days" when teachers were harrassed, intimidate­d, and fired for reasons that had NOTHING to do with their teaching ability.

Many times, school employment is the only decent job that is available in urban areas...th­is, more than anything, was what Rhee was fighting against in Washington­, D.C.  The community was not just incensed at her over tenure, they were incensed over the closing of schools and reducing support staff.  The over-abund­ance of teacher's aides, cafeteria aides, playground aides, security aides was eating into the monies available for direct student resources and instructio­n. Rhee was right to to what she did.

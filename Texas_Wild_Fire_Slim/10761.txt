We're open in Bastrop CountyBusiness leaders encourage tourismUpdated: Tuesday, 13 Sep 2011, 11:24 PM CDTPublished : Tuesday, 13 Sep 2011, 9:29 PM CDT

BASTROP COUNTY (KXAN) - Rebuilding in Bastrop will take time, community support and most of all money. That's why having a healthy economy will be an important step in the process. So, Chamber of Commerce leaders are asking people to keep spending locally and asking visitors to keep coming.  At  Cripple Creek & Company  on Main Street in Bastrop Dee Dee Peddy has built a business selling products made mostly in the Lone Star State - from wines to salsa to clothes.  "Texas products--we need to promote from within, yeah, absolutely," said Peddy. But sales have been slow since the fires.  "A lot of my customer base lost their homes," said Peddy. Only one customer stopped by during the first six hours her doors were open Tuesday and sidewalks on both sides of Main Street were empty.  "It would be heartbreaking to see us lose our downtown because we get visitors from all over the world and they come in and they just love to see this little historic district so vibrant, so alive and hopping with people," said Peddy. Chamber of Commerce Presidents from Bastrop, Elgin and Smithville worry about the fires economic impact. That's why the business leaders remind people around the state, nation and world Bastrop businesses are open! "We want everybody to understand although Bastrop County has been greatly impacted most of Bastrop county is ready for you to come and see us," said  Smithville Chamber of Commerce  President Adena Lewis. Downtown Bastrop is known as the heart of history and hospitality.  Those who live and work there hope it will also be known as a town of recovery and resiliency.  "If you're trying to find something that you can do to help, because people call all the time and say what can I do to help, come by and see us, shop in our local shops, that will be a great thing," said  Bastrop Chamber of Commerce  President Susan Wendel. Sarah and Kit Nash came to Bastrop from England. "We thought, oh my goodness, it's going to be too close to the fires, but, in fact, we rang ahead and they said absolutely fine, and when we've come here--it's just beautiful.  The skies are clear, there's no smell of smoke," said Sarah Nash.  "We want to support these folk, if we can, in our own little way," said Kit Nash.  Customers will keep businesses alive and Peddy's livelihood is counting on it.  "It needs to continue," said Peddy. Restaurants are faring pretty well right now because they are crowded with a lot of the emergency workers who are in Bastrop County working on the fire. The Nash couple is staying at the  Hyatt Lost Pines  and they say everything seems normal--just like it would on a nice vacation.

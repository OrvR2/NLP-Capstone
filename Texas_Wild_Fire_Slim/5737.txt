 Also, Heathcliff is NOT a person to be liked. He is vicious and cruel. In today's world he would be imprisoned. In this "politically correct" world we live in, how do you criticize a black Heathcliff? I will have to see the film to﻿ determine if Ms Arnold has made Heathcliff a persecuted figure.

I have not seen this﻿ film yet but I think I may be correct in assuming that Bronte aficionados will not be happy with this version. Overt sexual situations are not present in the original novels and Bronte purists may shy away.

Winn-Dixie's Q4 Earnings Cut in HalfBy MarketNewsVideo | Forbes – Tue, Aug 30, 2011




Related ContentWinn-Dixie's Q4 Earnings Cut in Half


Grocery store chain Winn-Dixie (WINN) posted fourth quarter earnings after the close of trading yesterday that were nearly cut in half.
Profits fell to $7.3 million, or $0.13 per share, from $14 million, or $0.25 per share, in last year’s fourth quarter. Net sales fell 3.8%, to $1.6 billion, although Winn-Dixie blamed the decline on a this year’s fourth quarter being a week shorter than last year’s.
Same-store sales rose 3.2%. Per-share results were just ahead of analyst expectations, while revenue met analyst forecasts. Winn-Dixie is looking for same-store sales growth of more than 3% in the first two quarter of the new fiscal year.
Other companies operating in Winn-Dixie’s space include SuperValu (SVU), Safeway (SWY), and Kroger (KR).

Well, Winn-  Dixie I bet is really  feeling the efffects of the economy I reckon. Ma and I went there and it was empty. We here down South just have no money any more. We can't sell the farm. Pa sold his teeth to pay the taxes and I have not washed my hair in a month or gone to Darla May's Beatuy shop in year. I'm sick of cooking the same corn meal day after day. Pa is getting contipated.
This Obama character has to go because we are not rich folk down here in Albama. I'm typing this on the Library computer and they even are only open 1 day a week. We had to down size our book inventory to 2 books in the library so layoffs began. We orginally only had 10 books.

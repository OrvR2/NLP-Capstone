A New Jersey welfare case worker has pleaded guilty to attempting to extort welfare recipients by threatening to terminate their benefits, according to U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman.
Walter Payton, 54, of Bayonne, N.J., appeared before U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark federal court Tuesday and pleaded guilty to "attempted extortion induced by wrongful use of fear of economic harm and under color of official right." 
Payton was employed as a welfare case worker by the Hudson County Department of Family Services, Division of Welfare and Workforce Development for approximately nine years. Payton’s duties included processing applications for food stamps, Medicaid, and cash assistance.
In August 2010, an individual identified only in court documents as "the Victim," began receiving welfare benefits of $280 per month in monetary payments and $330 per month in food stamps. The following month, Payton demanded payment of $200 from the Victim and said that if the Victim failed to pay, he would terminate the Victim’s benefits, according to court documents.

On September 27, 2010, Payton met the Victim near the Hudson County Department of Family Services office building where he accepted payment of $200 from the Victim. After accepting the money, Payton indicated there would be no need for additional payments, the court documents state.
According to Fishman, Payton has also admitted that he demanded similar extortion payments from four other Hudson County welfare recipients while working as a Hudson County welfare case worker.
Payton faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced on December 19.
County spokesman Jim Kennelly told The Jersey Journal that a review hearing will be held in the next two weeks, after which Payton will likely be terminated.
"His disgraceful, criminal acts were carried out against our most vulnerable residents, poor mothers with children," Kennelly told the Journal. "He deserves the fullest punishment available under law."

				This is a LOSE-LOSE situation for us the taxpayers. When we lock him up, we are going to provide food and shelter for him. IF he is the sole wage earner for his family, his family is going to become a case rather than the family of a case worker and WE WILL END UP PAYING THEM with FOOD STAMP and HOUSING ALLOWANCE.

				Let's see...this guy extorts $200 and faces 20 years in prison and a quarter of a million dollar fine...Wal­l Street extorts $1.2 trillion and so far no criminal charges have been filed (nor does it look like any ever will be).  Ah, the American justice system.

				This guy had a job of trust and ripped off people who had nothing, this was very wrong.. All the right wing comments about public unions wont change that . I have seen more good people helped by unions then hurt by them. A few people abuse the system but that happens in any system even the corporate systems. Especially at the top.

				Okay, I did.  The only public workers in prison drawing salaries that came up were the prison workers.

Of course, you were just told to do this by some other Tea Party member, neither one of you really knowing what "google it" means.  Just saying "google it" does not make a false statement true.

So, why don't you try providing a link to some reputable website with actual informatio­n supporting your claim?  Could it be because you can't?

				FYI, any journalist with a shred of decency and profession­alism HAS to use those sorts of terms and situation structures in regards to any kind of future event of a legal nature in which the outcome hasn't been cast in stone. It doesn't matter if we all know he's going to be found guilty or that he's going to get shitcanned­, news outlets cannot refer to anything of this type with any kind of absolute certainty without opening themselves up for some kind of an attack.

People keep making this stupid sodding complaint every time something like this gets reported, never realizing that outlets HAVE to use that wording for legal reasons.

      On the Moon, Flags & Footprints of Apollo Astronauts Won't Last Forever
    By

	When a NASA probe in orbit around the moon captured close-up photographs of several Apollo landing sites, relics of the lunar visits — like human tracks and discarded hardware — could clearly be seen on the dusty surface.

	But, while the artifacts seem well preserved on the lunar surface, scientists don't expect that to be the case in the long run.

	NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) snapped the high-resolution images of the Apollo landing sites from above  that are the sharpest views yet of where the Apollo 12, Apollo 14 and Apollo 17 astronauts touched down on the moon. The space agency released the new photos today (Sept. 6). [See the new Apollo moon landing site photos]

	The Apollo landing site photos zero in on the paths made by the visiting astronauts and their lunar rovers. They also show where the explorers left experiments and discarded unnecessary hardware before returning to Earth.  

	"They won't be there forever," Mark Robinson, an Arizona State University scientist and the principal investigator of LRO's camera, said in a news briefing today. "The moon is constantly bombarded with micrometeorites. These are very, very small particles that impact at very high velocities."

Erosion on the moon

	Robinson estimates that these impacts occur at more than 33,000 mph (53,000 kph). These collisions will eventually wear down the tracks and objects left at the landing sites, he explained.

	"Slowly over time, first the tracks will disappear — they will all be ground into and mixed into the soil," Robinson said. "And then, the smaller pieces of equipment will disappear, and eventually the descent stages will get probably blasted with a larger asteroid."

	From past studies of moon rocks collected by astronauts during the Apollo missions, researchers have learned that the rocks erode at a rate of about 0.04 inches every 1 million years.

	"In human terms, it may seem like forever, but in geologic terms, probably there will be no traces of the Apollo exploration in, let's say, ten to a hundred million years," Robinson said.

	The eventual disappearance of human traces on the moon could be incentive to somehow protect the sites where the Apollo astronauts landed and explored.

	"The moon doesn't have an atmosphere, so that makes it such that features seem more permanent because you don't have erosion, either by wind or water, to make those features disappear as quickly as they would on Earth," said Robert Pearlman, an expert on space history and collectibles, and editor of collectSPACE.com, a SPACE.com partner site. "But it's a dynamic environment, so nothing is forever. So, unless we take action to protect those sites, then natural forces will have their way."



American flags still standing?

	In 2009, LRO previously took photographs of the Apollo landing sites from a higher altitude, and curiosity arose about whether the American flags that were planted in the ground during the missions were still standing.

	Based on the new images, that mystery may remain unsolved, but Robinson is skeptical that the flags are intact, if they are still there. The moon's extreme heat and ultraviolet conditions would probably destroy the nylon flags over time, he explained.

	"Personally, I would be surprised if there's anything left on them," Robinson said. "You know how [if] you leave a flag out over summer, how it starts to fade. Now, imagine the extreme UV environment on the moon, and the hot and cold cycling, and it's been 40 years — so if the flags are still there, they're probably in pretty rough shape." [Top 10 Apollo Hoax Theories]

	Yet it is possible to detect where the flags are planted in the new LRO photos, Robinson added, because the "astronauts tramped down the ground an extra amount there."

	Unanswered questions about the American flags on the moon could fuel conspiracy theorists even more, but Pearlman thinks they represent further proof against supposed hoaxes.

	"I think it actually bolsters the idea that we actually did go," he said. "We didn't design a special American flag to go to the moon to last thousands of years. They literally sent out a secretary to the nearby Sears and bought an off-the-shelf flag and modified it."

	The natural disintegration of the flag's material in the harsh conditions on the moon's surface is to be expected, Pearlman said. Still, the new LRO images will do little to sway firm believers in the Apollo conspiracy theories, he added.

	"If they believe we actually faked going to the moon, then the idea of taking an image like this and adding a couple of dark pixels is way too easy," Pearlman said. "They're not going to be swayed. But, for everyone else, it's a new view of a great accomplishment."

Yes yea by asll means preserve this site .. so when future generations see it they can remember... America is just a bunch of white trash hillbillys...I at least hope they put the rovers up on blocks..I think they should be fined for littering.I think Cavers have they best Idea..Leave nothing behind,but footprints

Ooookayyyyy... so what you're saying is that the flag faded out and now all that's left is a white flag that humanity planted on the moon? Oh great! We've surrendered before any aliens have even gotten here!

I believe we did land men on the moon, but this lunar orbiter taking pictures of the moon's surface is just a hoax.

The hoaxers will just help the smear campaign when China goes, so they can claim to be first.

"The eventual disappearance of human traces on the moon could be incentive to somehow protect the sites where the Apollo astronauts landed and explored."
Okay, we're talking about multi-million years before the traces are gone and someone even has the temerity to think about somehow preserving these sites now?  If we haven't made a regular presence on the moon and beyond in the next ONE million years then most likely we're all dead and gone in any case so let's just give it a few hundred thousand years say before we worry about this okay?

I was thinking, Even though this is just more proof of the proven moon landings, some people will still claim it a hoax.  even if they saw the footprints with there own two eyes, they still would not believe

If we can't go to the moon and set up a permanent station there just how in the world does Obama think we could do a one year round trip to Mars and survive the mission? The expense of just going there to say we went is insane unless we go there to set up a permanent base. Sorry Obama, but first we need to go back to the moon and set up a permanent base there to learn what we need to learn to even think about going to some place as far away and as dangerous as Mars. Or for that matter even an astroid.

In the future, people will look back at this part of human history when our instinctive drive to solve problems ran open loop. Humans have evolved the ability to identifiy problems and solve them like bees make behives and honeycombs.

It may have been usefull in getting humanity out of the stone age, buts its totally out of control now. And the weird part is we pride ourselves on our problem solving ability.

But here is the thing? WHAT problem did we solve by sending people to the moon? WHY was it a problem that needed billions of dollars in human resources? HOW are we any better off now that 12 humans have scampered across the face of the moon.

DONT come back and tell me NASA invented velcro and tang and personal computers, that was not the objective of sending people to the moon. That would be like saying we fought WW2 in order to invent penecillin.

Who cares?  People won't last forever, either.  If we make it through the next 5000 years, it will be purely accidental.  Get off this "space wonders" crap, and study the world's oceans you nitwits!

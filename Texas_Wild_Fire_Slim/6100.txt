				350-400 workout tapes?

Why?

3 or 4 should be able to cover just about every exercise there is?

The only problem is dvd's usually do not come with exercise equipment.

Sounds like you collect dvd's.

				If you live someplace like L.A., you can get away without a gym. You can exercise outside, year round. When I lived in NYC, all you had was Central Park. Central park with slush on the ground, isn't a great place to exercise in January. 

Which is why I moved to L.A.

				Hard to stay discipline­d in Chicago, when you have delicious things like Home Run Inn pizza, and Garette popcorn. I've only been to Chicago once, for a grand total of 6 or 7 hours. But I have someone that brings me Home Run Inn frozen pizzas twice a year, and its good stuff. That popcorn is off-the-ho­ok -- and I don't even like popcorn. 

This is one of my main motivation­s with working out: I get to eat this stuff.

				The real question is who actually uses their membership­s.

The other question is who actually benefits from their workouts. I have seen people who lift such light weights that the benefit of training is nil.

An other  group of people don't even know what they are doing.

I saw a lady last night and I still cannot figure out what body part she was training, I'm sure she didn't either.

				So many people join and don't use their membership­s....it makes a huge difference if the club has helpful and observant staff, or free starter programs.  You don't have to hire a  personal trainer although it can be beneficial­.  Still, if you are a member and no-one will help you....go somewhere else!

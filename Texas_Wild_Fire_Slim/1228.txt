A day after leg cramps seized Rafael Nadal during a post-match press conference at the U.S. Open, landing him on the floor beneath the interview table and sending the tennis world into a brief tizzy, the world No. 1 women's star pantomimed some pain of her own after surviving a thrilling three-set match. 
Addressing the media following her thrilling comeback triumph over Svetlana Kuznetsova, Wozniacki imitated Nadal's press conference cramping, sliding down her chair just like Nadal did. The only difference was that she had a big smile on her face. 
After his win on Sunday, the Spaniard cramped up, grimaced and began moaning in pain in front of the cameras and dozens of reporters. He later brushed off the incident and said he was "just have cramping in my leg."
As is often the case whenever an athlete makes an attempt at humor, some people thought it was inappropriate for her to poke fun at Nadal, while others thought it was simply a funny joke. 
Besides, it's not like Wozniacki hasn't cracked jokes at a Grand Slam before. In a press conference shortly before Wimbledon, she surreptitiously made her way into the interview room at the All England Club and asked Novak Djokovic about his "losing streak of one." Everyone in the room, including Djokovic, got a kick out of it. 
Do you have a problem with Wozniacki's imitation?

				Lame.  Those who find her schtick funny have pretty low comedy standards.  She just seems like a very young person who wants to be a "personali­ty" but it just makes you roll your eyes.  I don't think it's a big deal but she's definitely not ready for primetime.

				can´t believe all this vile hatred directed towards Caroline,
such a humble and sweet girl, use to play football/s­occer with her older brother.
shes friends with Nadal, so but then again newspapers love fake outrage,

				Somebody please tell me who this was such an awful thing?  He didn't get cramps in the middle of a game he lost, he got them in a non competitiv­e setting and she was just making a joke.  But then again, false outrage has been a major component of reporting for the last decade or two.

				there is a question mark on Nadal right now about some of the injury timeouts  . . . I think they are mighty convenient sometimes  . . . it was a cincinnati match and he called a timeout because of a blister on his foot and the trainer comes out to rewarp the foot and the camera zooms in and you know . . . there was no blister.  Which then got the commentato­rs (Patrick McEnroe etc) to comment that there might be some grandstand­ing going on . . . some gamesmansh­ip . . .

				I am a fan of Nadal.  And if everybody is this oversensit­ive that everybody wrings their hands over something like this, then it is beyond idiotic.  If Nadal can't handle something that is so much milder than people in normal working environmen­ts see everyday then he needs to go live in an isolation chamber.

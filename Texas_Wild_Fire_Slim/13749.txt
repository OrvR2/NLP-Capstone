The state of Texas, under Gov. Rick Perry, cut state funding for the volunteer fire departments that protect most of the state from wildfires. Firefighters have actually been dipping into their own pockets to fight fires. Oh yeah, in Rick Perrys America, there no longer is an America. Just smaller government with death and destruction everywhere.

That does not matter marine corps pat like Obama is under orders from Rahm Emanuel, you never can let a serious crisis go to waste. Use the 1554 homeless family's loss to make a political point.

Volunteer fire departments are supported by individual communities. This lie has been shot down days ago, you're way behind on your bullshit fabrications. Try to keep up, boy.

Item - it's not a union dispute, the cpmany's NAME is Aero UnionItem - The TEA Party doesn't hate government. They hate improper government interferance. The Feds SHOULD take care of National Defense, external and internal (which widfires would come under), but the Feds should not be dabbling in every facet of life, life health insurance and education (a local and State issue). Nor should the Feds be taking money from investors to give to unions, especially monolopistic unions like the UAW. Each level of government has it's proper place. But when a level of government exceeds its authority, it is correct to say it is wrong.Item - Try getting information about the TEA Party (and the Right, in general) from over-the-top biased Leftwing sources - they lie. When I want to find out about the Left's point of view, I look to the Left, and sort out the B$ from the Truth.

And my bestto Corporal Punishment.What Perry should do is secede Texas from the Unionand see if that does any good. He said he'd like toand now is the time to find out if it works.Bye, bye, Texas.

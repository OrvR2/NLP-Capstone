The International Space Station passed over Texas at 11:07 a.m. Tuesday, giving a first look at the smoke plumes from space."It is a sad sight with all the fires burning in Texas right now," said astronaut Mike Fossum who was shooting the video from the ISS. "One very major one and three smaller ones."Cameras on the space station clearly showed several large plumes near Bastrop and another in the northeast part of the state near Texarkana.The ISS travels at 17,500 mph, and gave a view of the Texas landscape for about two minutes.Another view of the fires came from an exterior mounted camera on the left side of the vehicle.

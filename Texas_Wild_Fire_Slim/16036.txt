Locals share Sept. 11 stories




  
Kamal Ahmad Rahman wants back the smile he used to receive walking down the street. 
"After September 11th, that smile vanished," said Rahman, a 2001 Texas A&M agriculture business graduate. 
His wife, who wears a hijab -- or Muslim head covering -- received more, but less friendly, glances. His children were taunted in school as terrorists, he said
But since that day, the former captain in the Pakistani army, who has carved out a life for his family in Aggieland, has been on a mission to change hearts and attitudes. 
After the Sept. 11 attacks, his dad and other family members went to radio stations and schools to educate the community about Muslims and denounce terrorism. 
Now and then, Rahman speaks with classes at A&M. "I tell my fellow Aggies about Pakistanis and Muslims, and the world outside Texas and America," he said. 
And just last week, outside an Exxon station owned by the family off F.M. 2818, he held a blood drive. It was symbolic: Muslims in the media are often portrayed as life takers, but he wanted to save lives wtih the drive. 
The local community -- his community -- is a tolerant one, he said. And the treatment has been more positive than negative, he said, noting the many phone calls and well wishes from customers checking in to see if the family was OK after the attacks.
Rahman bleeds maroon. He even tried to join the Corps of Cadets when he started as a student in 1998, feeling a former Pakistani army captain could have a lot to teach the cadets. 
But the commandant told him that, being nearly twice the age of many of the cadets, the environment wouldn't be the best for him. Even today, he shakes his head at the thought. He's convinced he would have made a fantastic cadet. 
Growing up Muslim post 9/11
Rahman's four children have had a harder time than he has. But growing up is tough, he said. "Kids will be kids," he says to explain the taunting. "I tell my children, 'Smile, and ignore them.'"
Such a relaxed attitude comes natural for Rahman, a hardened soldier who spent the late 1980s crossing into Afghanistan to scope out routes for a potential Russian tank foray into Pakistan. Based on data he collected, he said, Pakistan deployed anti-tank missiles to the area. 
His sense of himself is secure. But his children struggled being kids in a post-Sept. 11 world. 
Raza, 13, attends A&M Consolidated Middle School. He's a die-hard wannabe Aggie, a walking trove of A&M football statistics. 
"When Osama bin Laden was killed, people came up to me and said, 'I'm sorry for your loss,'" he said. 
In addition to the pain that all Americans felt because of the attacks, that's the added burden that Muslims have to bear, said daughter Sana Rahman, a Blinn student. 
Only age 8 during the attacks, Sept. 11 shaped her generation. She can't hold back tears during documentaries of the day, and the screen on her cellphone is an image of New York. 
Sana Rahman, who wears a hijab and is now 18, wanted the taunting to stop so bad that she didn't want to wear the head covering anymore. 
"I didn't want to be perceived the wrong way and wanted people to know me for me," she said. "When people got to know me, it was OK ... It was a minor speed bump." 
And even Rahman himself has had moments where he tried to hide himself. Shortly after Sept. 11, he was working for a beer company and had to attend Chilifest, one of Aggieland's rowdier, whiter, drunker festivals. 
He said he wore a sombrero, kept a low profile and greeted people with, "Hey, amigo!"
A life in Aggieland 
These days, he struggles the same as other Americans. In addition to working at the store, he's a commercial real estate broker. 
"Mostly, I'm just broke," he quips.
But happy. On Friday evening, as he spoke with a reporter, Sana and Raza tossed a football back and forth. Family gathered at the home -- siblings, parents, nephews and others -- as they do every Friday evening for prayer and camaraderie. 
Kamal Ahmad Rahman lives a few minutes away from his store, and his parents live walking distance from it. He goes to his parents' home each day at 5 p.m. for tea. It's a simple life, complete with a dog named Casper. 
"We never came to America for money, honest to God," he said. "My dad was making more money in Saudi Arabia than we make over here. We came here for better living standards for my children, and a better, more secure future. I don't have any money in the bank, but I am very content." 
Rahman's father, Tasweer Rahman, said he's never had a reason to feel unwelcome in his 25 years or so in Bryan-College Station. 
"We were at home before 9/11," said the elder Rahman, who, before coming to America, was a manager at an oil company in Saudi Arabia. "And we're at home now. After the attack, the community openly expressed love for us."

Our View: We get a breather  lets put it to good use



 
 Local politicos can breathe a little bit easier, even in the heart of the Treasure Valleys ozone pollution season.President Barack Obama has backed away from tougher air quality rules, for the time being, ordering the federal Environmental Protection Agency to keep a Bush administration ozone rule intact until 2013.Whether Obamas decision represents a bow to reason or a cave-in to industry is fodder for debate back in D.C. But heres the key. Do the Valleys elected officials and civic leaders view his decision as a reprieve or as an opportunity?It should be the latter  a chance for the Valley to address its ozone problem proactively, on its own terms.The only thing that changed Friday was the feds yardstick. The Treasure Valleys air quality didnt improve a bit. And the fact remains that the Valley has a lingering ozone problem, triggered by traffic and midsummer heat. When sunlight cooks the nitrogen oxide gas found in exhausts, the chemical reaction produces ozone, an oxygen gas. Ozone then can irritate the eyes and lead to heart and breathing problems.Ozone pollution could also affect economic health, since EPA sanctions could restrict business activity and road construction. Thats why Fridays decision was a big deal; the Valley was on the cusp of violating the tougher ozone standards abruptly tabled by Obama.But 2013 isnt that far away, and affords little time for complacency.The state took a good step to address the problem with a law requiring emissions tests in Ada and Canyon counties. Canyon County commissioners continue to squawk about the tests, but their objections are both ideological and parochial. Since ozone is caused primarily by vehicle exhausts, the tailpipe tests are a logical part of a regionwide fight against this pollutant.The tests are also a good step to take while trying to change habits  by encouraging car pools or telecommuting  and while trying to build momentum for an upgrade in public transportation, which would require a big front-end commitment in tax dollars.Its unlikely that Fridays shift  imposed by Obama upon the EPA  will do much to change the public image of an agency Westerners love to hate. In pushing to cut $1.5 billion from the EPAs budget for 2011-12, Idaho Republican Rep. Mike Simpson placed much of the current economic malaise at the foot of the agency. Said Simpson, a House Appropriations Committee member, Wherever I go, the biggest complaint I hear about the federal government is how the EPA is creating economic uncertainty and killing jobs. Viewed from that perspective, tougher ozone regulations could kill jobs and create more economic uncertainty. Valley leaders have the next two years to take strong steps to head off federal sanctions.Our View is the editorial position of the Idaho Statesman. It is an unsigned opinion expressing the consensus of the Statesmans editorial board.

Kardashian sisters Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney stopped by the "Late Show" Tuesday night to clear David Letterman's confusion about their large, blended family.
"I saw the other night you were sitting around at Bruce Jenner's house. Why were you at Bruce Jenner's house?" Letterman asked.
"That's our stepdad, and my mom is married to him and has been married to him for 20 years," Khloe explained.
Newlywed Kim broke it down even further: "He has four kids, my mom had four kids before they got married, so that was eight, and they have two together. It’s like the Brady Bunch on crack." 
Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner, who recently joined the cast of "The Talk," was married to O.J. Simpson's lawyer Robert Kardashian Sr. for twelve years before they split in 1990. She married former Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991.

BASTROP, Texas (AP) — Gov. Rick Perry says a 100-member search team will comb an area of Texas near Austin for more possible victims from a massive wildfire already blamed for two deaths.Perry said the search of Bastrop will begin Wednesday morning. The blaze has destroyed more than 600 homes in and around Bastrop. Authorities said Tuesday that two people have died in one of the most destructive Texas wildfires in history.Perry said late Tuesday he deployed Texas Task Force 1, the state's elite search team, to help local authorities. The team includes a dozen search dogs.Texas Task Force 1 was also sent to New York following the Sept. 11 attacks and to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.Wildfires have scorched more than 45 square miles around Bastrop.

Maybe Perry shouldn't have cut funding for the volunteer fire departments since 80% of the fire fighters in Texas are volunteers. Typical republican!

there is no search team for the firefighters Perry laid off  in his Texas for the answer to the federal budget problem.Not a good leader for Texas,nor for America.He would let another state burn and not rehire firefighters.

What I'm hearing from Texans if i'm reading it correctly is; He laidoff 75% of the volunteer fire dept right? Evidently he(Perry) has not called on FEMA or any others for help outside his state. According to what I read,over one thousand homes were destroyed throughout the state with four deaths. I did hear Ron Paul say they(Texans fight disasters on there own without help from others(his statement on T.V. News from last week) is that fact? Someone help me out here please. If this is fact then the state was short of manpower to defeat such large and so many fires and in high winds. If the manpower would have been met they could have saved many acres of destroyed trees wild life,homes and human life. In my state if a large fire is sounded by alarms every local Fire dept. responds,Forestry fire depts respond,spotters respond,national guards if need. Also if needed other reponders from further areas of our state and or other surrounding states. We are totally surrounded by forestation,trees,brush. I have no idea how Texas responds to these type of fires in numbers fighting them. Give me a clue from a true blue Texan.

How many times is Obama going to pour money we can't afford into the same
plan that was a failure. It really doesn't matter what he does, some people are   
a glutten for punishment and will vote for him again.  As long as they get money
from the government they don't care how high the unemployment gets. In Nevada
it is called "Gaming The System".
As far as Rick Perry is concerned, Obama can only dream of what Gov. Perry
has accomplished with job growth in Texas. 
OK I'm ready for all the nasty replies that  you Democrats are so famous
for. I have to say they don't phase me. I have heard it all and then some.
Being married to a Marine that taught me how to handle people who
don't have my best interest at heart.

I think these fires are an indication of what happens when you use God's name in vane,
like Perry did when he tried to look so righteous with his praying, just to attract voters.

If things weren't so bad in Texas, I'd label the " hair pear" a really bad joke. Ya'll are stuck with him and all that will get him out of Texas is road tour so he can see why he doesn't need to waste his donors big bucks.

You can always expect the politicians to take advantage of a good backdrop while shanking volunteer FF's in the back. Reminds me of fighting the lightning complex fires a few years back. 11days on the line and half the resources were sent to fight other fires since the one I was on was for the most part under control.

Then in comes the national guard in their brand new nomex and shiny new boots to walk around on a fire that's a non-issue while the head of another fire 5 miles away made a really good run against a deliriously exhausted crew making a last ditch backfiring operation to try and save a small community. Good for pictures, though. Community is too small to not notice them leaving in their nice clean turnouts.

The next time the Governator showed up on a fire for a photoshoot down in Santa Cruz right after he signed budget cuts that would pull funding for a medical tent on large fires. No more of that sooper dooper anesthetic poison oak goo for us I guess. I heard the incident commander refused to shake his hand on camera.

I wish politicians would ask what is needed, do what they can, and stay OUT OF THE WAY. Go give orders somewhere else since most of them have not a CLUE what they are doing in a disaster scenario.

You can wear cowboy boots and a Stetson...but you're not a cowboy. If you take the boots and hat off Perry all you have left is a neocon politician pandering for votes. Rick, seriously, can you give us ONE detailed plan for how you're going to move America forward that doesn't involve turning our backs on the elderly, infirm, veterans and children? We'd like to know

Hey Rick.. you might have had a better chance at stopping these fires if you hadn't have cut volunteer fire fighters by 75% in order to save money. Now, you'll have to have FEMA bail you out.

Why is no one telling the truth about these wild fires.
The budget for the volunteer fire departments in Texas have
been cut by 75%.  The fire fighters are paying for equipment
with their own money. 
Rick Perry is the cause of all this suffering and destruction and
he is covering it up like a cat on a hot tin roof.

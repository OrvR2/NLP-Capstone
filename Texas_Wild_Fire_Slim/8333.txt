2 more opposition candidates file for Congo's pollAP – 16 hrs ago





KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — Two more opposition leaders have formally filed to become candidates in Congo's elections this year.Vital Kamerhe, the 52-year-old president for the UNC party and former parliament speaker, submitted his candidacy Wednesday, but said he was confident the opposition parties may unite behind one candidate before the November elections. Kamerhe had earlier called for the opposition to back a communal candidate, which would put more pressure on President Joseph Kabila.Kamerhe ran Kabila's campaign in 2006, when the constitution was changed so that he could run at 35 years old, the youngest president in the world.The second opposition leader to file on Wednesday was Nzangag Mobutu, the son of the longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko whose corruption is blamed for the economic ruin of the country.

"Fox and Friends" anchor Gretchen Carlson and Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz had a heated clash on Tuesday morning over comments a union leader made at President Obama's Labor Day rally.
Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa got a lot of applause in Detroit when he said of the Tea Party, "let's take these son-of-a-bitches out and give America back to America where we belong." President Obama was not present for Hoffa's comments, but conservatives quickly pounced, asking the White House to condemn Hoffa. The White House has so far refused to issue any statement on the controversy, and Wasserman Schultz followed the same playbook when she spoke to Carlson.
Her appearance was ostensibly about Obama's upcoming jobs announcement, but Carlson steered the conversation towards Hoffa.
"Some people are saying that that's violent language, Congresswoman," she said. Wasserman Schultz declined to comment.
"We need to make sure that we focus on the middle class and working families," she said. "But wait a minute," Carlson said. "[Hoffa said] 'let's take these sons of bitches out'...and that's your response?"
"My response is that we should be working together," Wasserman Schultz said, beginning to talk about jobs. Carlson cut her off. 
"I'm talking about what Jimmy Hoffa said yesterday," she said. "I know you'd like to focus on language--" Wasserman-Schultz replied.
"it was very serious language!" Carlson said. Wasserman Schultz actually laughed at this.
"Are you kidding me?" she said. "You take a walk with me through Tea Party rallies." After more crosstalk, Wasserman Schultz turned her aim on Carlson.
"How many times have you called out coarse language at Tea Party rallies on this network. Almost never," she said. "Plenty," Carlson shot back. "I sit in the middle of the couch. I'm fair and balanced, Debbie. What is your response?"

SUPPORT THE RESISTANCE http://www.wearechange.org/?page_id=9453http://www.facebook.com/LukeWeAreChangehttp://www.twitter.com/LukeRudkowskihttp://www.WeAreChange.orgLuke Rudkowski finds the Chairman of the 9/11 Commission Report Thomas Kean and won't leave him alone until the unanswered questions about 9/11 are answered. Of course Kean run's away, dodges questions and calls over security during the questioning when asked about  Philip Zelikow's 9/11 Commission outline, that was written before the investigation started. If this video shows anything, it shows how there was a massive cover up of the events of 9/11 by the Bush Administration. Please share this video with your friends and family as the 10th anniversary of 9/11 approaches to demand a REAL 9/11 INVESTIGATION. Sorry for the audio problems the $10 microphone we use acts up sometimes. More surprises still to come, subscribe to the WeAreChange channel to see more in the upcoming days.Special Thanks to Bob McIlvaine for being an amazing human being and Dustin D editorhttp://rememberbuilding7.org/10/

You see how he keeps one ear to the guy with the camera, but tries to look like hes ignoring him.
That means he is being watched by someone else.
That means he is "listening" that means he has 2nd thoughts about what he did, but hes﻿ looking for a way out.
If you get that guy in a safe house, he will talk.

He was Proud at first.
Then when he was asked a real incitefull question , he got angry.
Then , you actually see him seem guild ridden.
This man knows people were murdered and his silence is makes him a traitor.
Not﻿ sure if he fears jail more or his family being murdered.

By staging 911 the military industrial complex and the banksters stole trillions from the hard working taxpaying slaves in America. Elites are like false prophets. They preach you to do things they won't do themselves. if you support their war they would label that as patriotism. you will be called a hero if you die to make them rich. Ask not what﻿ your country can do for you but what you can do for your country. so, sign up to join the army while the "elites" send their kids to private schools.

I guess semantically we need to ask a "criminal investigation" take place. That way, anyone who hinders prosecution is subject to criminal charges. Once these guys like Kean are under oath, they will be forced to keep their MAFIA oaths. Then the investigation proceeds so they all hang together. These guys﻿ doing the cover up have had nothing to lose. Only a criminal investigation raises the ante.

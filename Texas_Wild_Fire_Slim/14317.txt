Wildfire Smoke in Fort Bend County: Smoke from wildfires throughout Texas affecting air quality
				
				Posted by: admin on: September 8 2011 • Categorized in: 1. News, Announcements, Events 
Message from:
Fort Bend County
Office of Emergency Management
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
The smoke and haze you see in the air over Fort Bend County is from the wildfires elsewhere in the state. There are currently no immediately threatening wildfires in Fort Bend County.
Citizens of Fort Bend County should not be alarmed by the smoke or haze; however, at the same time, citizens should be cognizant of the extreme fire danger that exists in our area at this time.
Precautionary/Preparedness Actions
State health officials urge people to reduce their risk from wildfire smoke by taking the following precautions:

Stay indoors or limit outdoor activities as much as      possible.
Avoid physical exertion.
Keep windows and doors of your home shut.
If you have air conditioning, run it with the fresh-air      intake closed. Set wall units to “re-circulate.”
Reduce other sources of indoor air pollution, such as      cigarette smoking, burning candles, frying food and using aerosol products      or fireplaces.
Do not use vacuum cleaners which can stir up dust      already inside your home.
Keep your airways moist by drinking plenty of water.
Consider leaving the area or going to a shelter until      smoke conditions improve.
Common symptoms of smoke exposure include coughing,      scratchy throat, irritated sinuses, shortness of breath, chest pain,      headaches, stinging eyes and runny nose.

People should seek medical help if they have symptoms that worsen or become severe. Those without air conditioning should watch for signs of heat exhaustion such as fatigue, nausea, headache and vomiting.

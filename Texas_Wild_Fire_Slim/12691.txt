Burned classic cars... painThe fires that recently turned Texas into apocalypse land have left many in physical or emotional pain and it seems like the issue has found		

 

		 a way to affect every aspect of one’s personality. We’re not here to talk about how you suffer when you see other human beings being killed, hurt or left in misery, as we’ve already experienced those feelings. Unfortunately,   there’s a new part of our brain that is now being damaged by this  - the automotive enthusiast one.

We are here to look at a particular case, which implies one man in Texas who was supposed to be happy these days, as his house was only superficially touched by the flames and his family was untouched by the disaster. However, the fire didn’t entirely pass by what belonged to John Chapman (70). Oh no. 

The man was the owner of an impressive collection of classic cars, with around 175 sweet rides sitting in his garage. According to Jalopnik, the lot was destroyed by the fire, with what was was once a mighty dream-garage-come-true now being reduce to burned metal.

Want a few examples of what was destroyed? a 1966 Pontiac GTO, as well as multiple 1950s Chevys are just a small part of the classic car population that was murdered by the flames.

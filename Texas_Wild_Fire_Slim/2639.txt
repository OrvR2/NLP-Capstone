Peru court cuts sentence of president's brotherAP – 8 hrs ago





LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peru's Supreme Court on Wednesday reduced to 19 years the prison sentence of a brother of President Ollanta Humala who was convicted of leading a 2005 military uprising that killed four police officers.Former army Maj. Antauro Humala was initially sentenced to 25 years for aggravated homicide for leading 100 army reservists in the New Year's Day takeover of a police station the Andean city of Andahuaylas to demand the resignation of then-President Alejandro Toledo.Four police officers were killed in the failed uprising, as were two army reservists.On Wednesday, Peru's judiciary said in a statement that following an appeal, the Supreme Court had changed the charge against Antauro Humala to simple homicide and reduced his sentence.Under the new sentence, the president's brother will remain in prison until Jan. 2, 2024.His lawyer, Rosario Montero, objected to the ruling. The defense had asked for the sentence to be annulled and Humala to be retried for sedition.The defense argued he could not be tried for murder because the author of the gunshots that killed the four officers have not been identified.In declarations to local media, Antauro Humala has said his brother's election to the presidency has created the conditions for his release.Asked about a possible pardon for his brother, the president responded that a pardon was not on the government's agenda.

I was specting that some like that happen.
Humala promised fight against corruption and this is one act of corruption.
Is well known that Peruvian Justice is deeply corrupted, each supreme judge has a piramid of corruption in the lower levels, no one is promote to the next level if doesn't belong to one of those and pay for it.
Many of Peruvian people has been migrating to other countries because of deeply corruption in whole country, that's include goverment institutions, military (all), and big private companies.
who's try to stay out of chain of corruption promptly they are involve in false charges and fire.

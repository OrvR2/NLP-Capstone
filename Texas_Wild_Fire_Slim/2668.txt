UN chief calls for urgent action on climate changeBy KRISTEN GELINEAU - Associated Press | AP – 5 hrs ago





SYDNEY (AP) — United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Thursday that urgent action was needed on climate change, pointing to the famine in the Horn of Africa and devastating floods in northern Australia as examples of the suffering caused by global warming.Ban lashed out at climate change skeptics during a speech at the University of Sydney, arguing that science has proven climate change is real.Ban is in Australia for a series of meetings following his attendance at an annual forum of South Pacific island leaders in New Zealand earlier this week. He also made stops in the Solomon Islands and Kiribati, low-lying South Pacific island nations threatened by rising sea levels."Watching this high tide standing on the shore of Kiribati, I said, 'High tide shows it's high time to act,'" Ban said. "We are running out of time."Ban has repeatedly highlighted the issue of climate change during his South Pacific tour, which comes ahead of a major climate summit in Durban, South Africa, in November. Delegates from 193 nations will try to hammer out a global agreement to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists say are behind climate change.Ban dismissed accusations that previous summits haven't resulted in any measurable changes, pointing to the 2010 meeting in Cancun, Mexico, where countries agreed to try to keep the global average temperature from rising 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Scientists say there could be a severe impact on agriculture, sea levels, water resources and human health were the temperature to rise more than that.Drought and conflict in the Horn of Africa have left millions of lives at risk, and extreme weather events such as severe flooding that devastated northern Australia earlier this year will only grow more frequent as climate change accelerates, Ban warned."This is a global race to save the planet," he said.

I Love to See TEXAS is having a Honkey Tonk BBQ. Serves them right for 8 years of Bush and denying Global Warming. They couldn't even figure out how to use the back flush valve on Pool as their illegal Mexican Pool service man fled early! Not a FireHydrant in sight. Just 40,000 gallons of water 12 feet in backyard! Ah hahaha.

But Texans can always move to Arizona where they can get 12 inches a year. Of DUST.

God made us the perfect planet. It is has the perfect orbit, wobble, rotation, axial tilt, sun, moon, atmosphere, gravity and magnetic field to sustain life. There are cycles in temperature but within our survivability.

Read up about the mini ice age and solar activity. There were several in the past 400 years or so. They lasted about 70 years I think. Instead of the sun following the predictable 11 year solar cycle, it almost completely goes dormant for some reason. One of them is called the Maunder Minimum. Look it up. These minimums are easy to verify by counting solar spots on a daily basis.

People speculate that the warm weather we have is just part of a weather cycle. If that is true, we should be having colder weather as we are heading towards an ice age, not leaving one. There is really no controversy with main stream scientist. Most of the problem is false information put out by the business community because they may have to spend millions on pollution equipment.

One thing people are confused about is the fact that there has been climate change before in the history of the planet.  What is different now is that Human effects are causing a much more rapid change than has ever happened before.  Climate change now is progressing at a breakneck pace as planets measure speed.  It is obvious if you simply observe how many species are moving to higher altitudes and further north.  Also it is obvious if you simply note the accelerating changes in Greenland's ice cap, and the south polar ice.  We are in a crisis, and only propaganda is preventing more people from understanding it.

For example, the internet is being flooded with ads stating that natural gas fracking is safe.  It is not.  They also say that tar sands in Canada can be used for energy safely.  That is a lie.  Even though natural gas is less polluting than coal, it also contributes to global warming.  Other ads say that CO2 can be sequestered from coal or other plants.  That is another lie.  These ads are sponsored by ExxonMobile and other such companies, and they are so ignorant that they are placing profit above truth and above the survival of Earth.

Much propaganda against Nuclear Energy has resulted from the disaster in Japan, but right in Fukushima is proof that Nuclear Energy can be safe.  The plants that melted down were designs from the 1970's.  Near to them is another plant that was hit by the same quake and tsunami, but shut down automatically and with no problems.  That design was from the 1980's.  Just in that ten years there was that much improvement in safety, and the most recent designs are entirely safe, and can burn the stockpiles of Nuclear waste as fuel.

We must stop burning coal.  There is no economic or safe way to sequester the CO2 from coal or oil or natural gas plants.  Coal is the worst.  If we replace coal plants with modern Nuclear plants as quickly as possible that will help a great deal.  Then any combination of renewables (solar, wind, tide and wave, etc) plus more nuclear plants can replace the rest of the fossil fuels.  We must do this as soon as possible.

We should definitely ignore global warming. The Earth is having a fever to try to rid itself of the human infection and the sooner it succeeds the better.

Forbes – Wed, Jul 27, 2011 New NASA Data Blow Gaping Hole In Global Warming Alarmism

NASA satellite data from the years 2000 through 2011 show the Earth's atmosphere is allowing far more heat to be released into space than alarmist computer models have predicted, reports a new study in the peer-reviewed science journal Remote Sensing. The study indicates far less future global warming will occur than United Nations computer models have predicted, and supports prior studies indicating increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide trap far less heat than alarmists have claimed.

@bobbybenjamin
He made the Ad praising Reagan for what﻿ he stood for at the start, when almost no other suported him.
When Reagan changed his positions Ron left because Ron does NOT change positions. Opportunistic politician? There were 4 other people supporting Reagan at that time, what in the world are you talking about?

@madest LOL! Oh u pathetic insensate sap. Been cordial so far, but now logic is wearing u down, so u resort to kindergarten-namecalling? THAT alone should make self-evident who the REAL "dummy" is.
Then again, it's fruitless to introduce cognitive logic to u, a delusional troglodyte who moronically swallows MSM propaganda w/out any examination & rationalizes supporting a murderous WARCRIMINAL oBUSHma as being more sanctified,﻿ than actually researching a candidate w/100% Const.record. Why bother

Why is this video unlisted? Youtube must be in bed with the fed.. Shows how scared the establishment is. Someone upload this video﻿ on their account, spread the word.

@keekie5 like i﻿ said not the brain power to debate. You want PC? sorry not my thing. If I cannot call a dumbfounded idiot with no insight or intellect a moron just that....Welp go cry about it I need not care. You should probably do what you said and stop commenting. I am by far your superior in all aspects of life. More money, more brains and way better looking. So that's 3 for 3. You cannot compete.

@AllKnowingCreator I'm not an anything "bot". I didn't even vote for Obama. I just have found you particularly entertaining to aggravate. Again, I appreciate your passion for the political status in America, but you take yourself too seriously. You'll have﻿ a heart attack at a young age. Nobody wants to pay for that. Are you ready to hug it out? Think it over. I'll be here when you're ready.

@techservant so my attitude is going to make up ur mind who to vote for. Hmmmm im not in here to MAKE you worship Ron Paul, I thought I was debating and asking you a few questions, never once have I put u down.﻿ Im sorry if I came across that way, I just like people to vote, its up to u WHO u vote for not me. But I do like to stick up for Ron Paul when sooo many and media bash him is all. Take care :)

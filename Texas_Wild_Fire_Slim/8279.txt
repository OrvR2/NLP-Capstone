Venezuela poll: Chavez's popularity unchangedBy FABIOLA SANCHEZ - Associated Press | AP – 11 hrs ago





CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — President Hugo Chavez's approval ratings remain in the 50 percent range, but a majority of Venezuelans disapprove of the government's performance on key issues such as crime, corruption and the economy, according to a poll released Wednesday.The survey by the Caracas-based polling firm Datanalisis said Chavez's popularity stood at about 49 percent in late July, similar to his 50 percent rating the previous month. The poll consulted 1,300 Venezuelans and had a margin of error of nearly three percentage points.Chavez has scaled back his televised appearances recently while undergoing cancer treatment. He had a tumor removed from his pelvic region in June and says chemotherapy aims to prevent any reappearance of cancerous cells.The 57-year-old president's popularity hasn't been affected by his illness, said Luis Vicente Leon, president of Datanalisis.Leon said, however, that for the first time in the monthly poll, Venezuelans evaluated the government's performance negatively in a majority of areas."That could have to do with the fact that Chavez isn't as present as he was before, and so people may perceive that the country is a bit paralyzed," Leon told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.The monthly survey asked Venezuelans' views about the government's performance in 14 areas. While nearly 53 percent evaluated the government's social programs for the poor positively, for other areas those disapproving outnumbered those with favorable views.A large majority were dissatisfied with the government's performance in areas including jobs, housing, "your economic situation," ''personal security," and "ending corruption."Chavez, who has been in office since 1999, plans to run for re-election in late 2012.The survey said nearly 33 percent of those polled said they would vote for an opposition candidate if the presidential election were held immediately, while 31 percent would support Chavez. Others said they didn't know, didn't answer or wouldn't vote for any candidate.Chavez said Wednesday that he expects his cancer treatment to conclude later this year."I should be finishing this whole process at the end of October, November," Chavez said, addressing a televised rally of supporters by telephone.As for next year's election, he said, "we're going to give the counterrevolutionary opposition a beautiful knockout."

I appauld the fact that he is trying to fight poverty but not by taking away from people like landowners who worked, sweated, and produced for the country. Since when is being born into poverty an entitlement? What did those people do to be given land that was worked by someone else? I do not believe that his popularity is that strong. I believe that his armies "strong hold" and intimidate the general public. Someone said it best, "they're hoping the cancer will win." The biggest gripe that I have with Chavez, because I can put all this to the side-it simply doesn't involve me. Yes, my biggest peeve is how he defended his good friend Gadoffi or Kadaffi-whatever. He praised him and blamed the US for Gadaffi's downfall. Now we are finding out about all the autracities Gadaffit inflicted on his own people, the abuse of power and money, the sadistic treatment of people by his family members, etc.  Is this what Chavez, the benevolent, praises? I couldn't trust him after he supported Gadaffi.

I'd like to open up a discussion as to why America hates Hugo Chavez so much. Let's move beyond the ignorant rhetoric of "He's a communist" or "he's a fascist", and really take a look at what he's done for the Venezuelan people. 

First of all, Hugo Chavez was democratically elected, and then democratically re-elected, as such he is not a dictator in any way shape or form.

Immediatly after being elected, he enacted the Plan Bolivar 2000: 

The plan involved around 40,000 Venezuelan soldiers involved in door-to-door anti-poverty activities, including mass vaccinations, food distribution in slum areas, and education. The program also transported thousands of poor and ill Venezuelans at cost by military cargo planes and helicopters, as a means of alleviating their domestic travel expenses. 

Under his presidency in Venezuela, crime has gone down, poverty has gone down, the unemployment rate has gone down, Venezuala's GDP is at a twenty year all time high, inflation is down. 

People in the United States have said we should stop buying oil from Citgo, because it is owned by Venezuela which has nationalized their oil industry. It isn't very advertised however, that a portion of the profits from Citgo gasoline goes to homeless shelters in the United States, and that both Citgo and Venezuela provide discount heating oil to families in the U.S.

And yet, many of you hate him.

I would be willing to bet many Venezuelans don't like or dislike Chavez.. many simply don't care. It's the same with government in America as long as people can eat and make their little pay they don't really care what's happening or who's president. (Actually a startling number of Americans can't even name the VP, lol) 
I'm sure Chavez has genuine support amongst the people though. American media simply doesn't like any leader who are bad for business interests. Teodoro Obiang, King Hamad Al Khalifa, Islam Karimov, King Abdullah.. the list goes on of dictators who the media doesn't care about and American politicians embrace with open arms.

Sooner or later the business class will run out of money to give the poor and the infrastructure will collapse.  All of this is the ruling classes fault for not raising the standard of living of its lower working class.  The same is true of many other Latin American countries where racism dictates how well a person will do in life.  Obama is on the same track with Chavez, Morales, Correa, the Castros, and Ortega.  If we don´t vote obama out in November 2012 we will be another banana republic with a socialist government that will change America for the worse.  P

What's with AP, and Yahoo, and their fascination with Chavez?!  
Why don't they report that Chavez is allowing the Iranians to build a ballistic missile launcher down in Venezuela with the help of the Russian?  Don't they know that Putin recently said that Americans are like Parasites (Hinting that we needed to be exterminated)?  Doesn't Yahoo &  AP know that the Russians are also helping Iran & Venezuela build nuclear reactors, and both countries have called for our destruction?  So why all the positive, sympathetic new on Chavez?  Are the two Media outlets purposely keeping us in the dark, and if so, why?

If you believe any poll taken by Venezuelans is accurate, I've got a bridge for sale to you in Brooklyn --  these polls are only designed to bolster the half-dead  dictator's ego and his waning supporters spirits.........

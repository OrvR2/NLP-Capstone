No one, it seems, wants to live in a Barbie World. At least not now, anyway.
Rolling Stone has unveiled their reader-voted Top 10 worst songs of the 90s, with Aqua's "Barbie Girl" earning the number one dishonor. It's a real display of public regret; the song, by the Danish-Norwegian balladeers, sold 8 million records worldwide, and topped 13 different music charts in 11 countries.
The song peaked at seven on the US Billboard Hot 100, which gives the nation a warped bragging right over all the rest of the high-pitched dance torture enthusiast nations.
Coming in second was another dance treat, Los Del Rio's Bar Mitzvah and wedding anthem "Macarena," and then in third was Billy Ray Cyrus' "Achy Breaky Heart." 
Click over to Rolling Stone for the rest of the top ten.

				I actually heard that song for the first time a year ago and had to stop listening after the first chorus. I couldn't believe how many boy bands exploded in the late nineties thanks to the Backstreet Boys. Even worse I used to argue with people back then about how the Backstreet Boys were NOT the Beatles of the 90s. A popular comparison that was unfortunat­ely being made at the time.

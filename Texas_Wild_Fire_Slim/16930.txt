253.11 Bike Tour of Austin CowParade


Posted: Mon, 12 Sep 2011 05:00:54 +0000
I have an odd fascination with the Austin CowParade. I’m just so inspired and impressed by the artwork. All of the cows just immediately grab my attention whenever I see one, and it’s nice to know that some of them will be auctioned off to benefit the Dell Children’s Hospital in October.

Here’s your chance to check out the cows on one of Austin’s preferred methods of transportation, by bike. Austin Cycling Association has put together a cool bike tour of the artwork. They’ll meet at the pavilion level at Whole Foods to socialize before hitting the pavement.
The plan is to be back by 8:30 where dessert (think cookies and milk) will follow, along with a mobile upload session of photos to the ACA Facebook page. The ride will be less than 10 miles and will be at an easy pace, one that’s suitable for cruiser bikes. Lights and a helmets are required to participate in the ride.
Don’t forget your camera and some cash for snacks, and remember that I’m hosting a CowParade photo contest, so make sure to upload any great shots you get to my Facebook page too!
When: Tonight
Time: 6-9 p.m.
Location Start:
Whole Foods
525 North Lamar Boulevard
Austin, Texas 78701

252.11  Visit Austin 9/11 Memorial


Posted: Sun, 11 Sep 2011 05:00:16 +0000
Today marks the 10 year anniversary of September 11th. I still cannot believe that it  was ten years ago today, I still remember exactly what I was wearing that day and where I was. Thank you to all those that showed valiant acts of bravery on that day and since as our country has continued to fight to maintain its freedom.

I think that most appropriate thing to do today to honor the lives the events and the lives that were lost that day would be to visit Austin’s 9/11 memorial.
The 9/11 monument is dedicated to all the Texans who were lost on September 11th. After several designs for the exhibit were submitted the final design included two steel columns from Ground Zero. The columns stand in the exact state that they were recovered, you are encouraged to touch and examine them.
May God Bless America and Austin, Texas.

251.11 The Hound Hunt


Posted: Sat, 10 Sep 2011 05:00:49 +0000
I love a good scavenger hunt, so add your dog into the mix and it just gets better! On top of that, this-city wide scavenger hunt will benefit the Austin Humane Society.

You can have up to four humans and four dogs per team. You don’t need to have a dog on your team, but that might take away from some of the excitement.
Starting at 3 p.m. “pawsports” will be given out and the hunt will commence. You’ll have to make stops throughout the city and solve clues, complete activities and take pictures (don’t forget your camera!)
The hunt will end at metrodog where points will be tallied and an after party will follow. You don’t need to participate in the hunt to join the party. The party is free and open to the public, and it lasts from 6-8 p.m.
Happy hunting!
Registration: $15
When: today
Time: 2 p.m. –  8 p.m.
Location Start:
Jo’s Coffee on South Congress
1300 South Congress Ave.

247.11 Crepes Mille


Posted: Tue, 06 Sep 2011 13:47:07 +0000
My thoughts are with everyone’s lives have been affected by the fires. I am working on compiling a list that has what donation centers are seeking and where you can drop off. Feel free to leave comments on today’s post with donation centers you would like included.

My mind always does this rather bizarre thing where it thinks it doesn’t like crepes, but then every time I have one I really like it.
I was on South Congress a few weeks ago and thought I would give them a try and discovered, yet again, that I love crepes!
Crepes Mille has a sweet and a savory side to the menu, so you can have the best of both worlds. And if you order two savories, you can get one from the sweet side for free. My sister and I got a few random items, like a pepperoni pizza crepe, that ended up being great. I definitely want to go back and try the shrimp scampi and the rotisserie chicken crepes, but those will have to wait for my next visit.

On the sweet side, you can’t go wrong. Order the “easy crepe” and put your favorites on top. Milk chocolate and Oreo cookie do the trick for me. Their menu is huge, so you can keep going back and trying new things, which is cool.
Let me caution you, they are made fresh, so expect a little bit of a wait.
Hours:
Monday: 11 a.m.- 4 p.m.
Thursday & Friday: 11 a.m. – 3 p.m.
Thursday & Friday:  6 p.m. – 10 p.m.
Saturday: 10 a.m. – 10 p.m.
Sunday: 11 a.m. – 4 p.m.
Location:
1318 South Congress Ave.
Austin, Texas 78704

246.11 Austin Free Day of Yoga


Posted: Mon, 05 Sep 2011 05:00:58 +0000
Happy Labor Day! I’m sure many of us are relaxing and enjoying our extra day of rest this weekend. Today is the official Free Day of Yoga in Austin. That means that all day and into the evening local studios (and parks!) all over Austin will be offering free classes!

The classes will be suitable for all levels. You can use this as an opportunity to try a new studio or a new style of yoga. I can already tell you that bikrim yoga is not for me, but I think everyone should take a bunch of classes and find out what they like.
The Free Day of Yoga has been an annual event in Austin since 1999 and has now spread to other cities, so find your center and enjoy a day off work.
Class Schedule: http://www.freedayofyoga.com/schedule-2011.php

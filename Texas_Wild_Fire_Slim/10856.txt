Randall Hopley arrested on kidnapping, child abduction chargesBy Bill Graveland, The Canadian Press | The Canadian Press – 7 hours ago

SPARWOOD, B.C. - The man arrested Tuesday on kidnapping and child abduction charges in the disappearance of three-year-old Kienan Hebert was found hiding in an old mining cabin in southwestern Alberta, his scent picked up by an astute police dog.Randall Hopley, 46, was arrested in a remote area near Crowsnest Pass, a short drive away from Kienan's home in Sparwood, B.C."It doesn't get any better than this," a smiling Insp. Brendan Fitzpatrick told a news conference.Kienan vanished nearly a week ago from his two-storey house, and it was there that he mysteriously reappeared this past Sunday.The boy's disappearance prompted a massive search around the home, an Amber Alert that eventually spanned two provinces and days of breathless headlines across the country as the public and Kienan's family hoped he would be found safe.Fitzpatrick said a tip led police to an area near Crowsnest Lake, not far from a local bible camp. Fitzpatrick said the Mounties arrived Monday night, a perimeter was set up and police dogs began combing the area.By Tuesday morning, the dogs had reached a set of abandoned mining cabins."As one (of the dog handlers) knocked on the door, the dog indicated that there was possibly some activity, and the dog master and the police dog pursued that and it resulted in Mr. Hopley being arrested in a short chase," said Fitzpatrick.Hopley was arrested for kidnapping and abducting a child under 14, said Fitzpatrick.He was being held in Cranbrook, located about 70 kilometres southwest of Sparwood, and was to make his first court appearance Wednesday morning. Hopley has also been charged with two counts of breach of probation during the past week, court records indicate.The arrest marked the end of a long week for the more than 150 officers involved in the case, many of whom have been working 20-hour days since it began, said Fitzpatrick."I can tell you that this is one of the best days that these investigators out here have seen," he said."To have that child found in the middle of the night on Sunday was absolutely exhilarating, and now to tell the community that we have this man in jail and they can go back to their normal course of business is a very proud moment for the RCMP."Police have said Kienan's parents put him to bed last Tuesday night, only to discover he was missing the following morning. The family reported his disappearance to police, who immediately launched a search from the ground and air. The Amber Alert naming Hopley as a suspect was issued Wednesday evening.Kienan's father, Paul Hebert, said he was relieved when he heard of the arrest and has already forgiven Hopley."There's two ways that you can look at it: You can feed hate or you can feed love. They're both characters. Hate is a very hungry animal and I just don't choose to feed that animal," Hebert told reporters earlier in the day."He's a man that needs help."Hebert has been critical of the justice system for failing to intervene as Hopley amassed a lengthy criminal record, including one case that included allegations involving a child.In 2008, Hopley pleaded guilty to break and enter and was sentenced to 18 months in jail. A Crown spokesman has confirmed Hopley admitted in court that he attempted to take a 10-year-old boy from a home in Sparwood, although charges of unlawful confinement and attempted abduction were stayed.In the 1980s, Hopley was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to two years in federal prison, though few public records are available to confirm the nature of those allegations.The RCMP also used Tuesday's news conference to respond to critical news coverage about how the force handled the case, specifically the timing of the Amber Alert and how someone was able to enter the Hebert's empty home undetected when Kienan was returned.Much of the news coverage of the case has focused on the Amber Alert, with reporters questioning why it wasn't issued sooner and why it took several days before it was expanded into Alberta.When Kienan was reported missing, Fitzpatrick said police immediately examined the possibility of issuing an Amber Alert while search teams combed the area around the family's home.Fitzpatrick explained the case did not yet meet the threshold to activate the system — a set of criteria that wasn't met until police identified Hopley as a suspect.And while the Amber Alert was extended into Alberta on Saturday, Fitzpatrick insisted the media coverage of the case had already achieved the same effect."At our earliest opportunity, when the threshold had been met, the Amber Alert was activated," said Fitzpatrick."The minute that Amber Alert was activated, I was monitoring the Internet and the news, the coverage was extensive in Alberta — it had arguably as good coverage or better than we saw in British Columbia."He acknowledged police weren't watching the Hebert home when Kienan was returned, but he said there was no reason to believe that would happen."I will say that the probability that Kienan be returned to his residence is extremely low. It's a virtually unprecedented situation," he said.Hebert has said he left the home unlocked hoping Kienan would be returned there, though he hasn't said whether he did so on the advice of police.Sharon Fraser, Sparwood's acting mayor, said she hopes news of the arrest helps her community move on after what she described as "the longest week in Sparwood.""My God, maybe now we can get back to some reality and normality, you know?"Still, Fraser said Kienan's disappearance taught Sparwood residents some difficult lessons and she suggested life may never return completely to normal."This is one of the hardest lessons all of us have had to learn, that we can't leave our doors unlocked and we can't let our children just run."— With files from James Keller and Keven Drews in Vancouver

This all seems really fishy, how do they know it was him? I would like to know what the kids account of what happened is.

this clearly was a mistake by the Canadian justice system (as the father of the abducted stated) to release a sick man, is not fair on the man, nor on the people he happened across (society)

This guy looks terribly crazy. Hurting innocent kids or anyone for that matter is so terrible.  If he was not guilty then why was he hiding.  Hope they lock him up for life. If they don't, then he will do worse the next time

I was abducted from school, when I was 6 years old, by a stranger. The only reason I'm here is because of the knowledge that there were people that know me and care for me and that he had been seen. We saw my brother along the way of a very scary ride. "Did he see you?" he asked several times. I am a survivor. I think often of this event in my life. I remember the tire iron in the front seat. I know that Kienan's chances were very slim. This is the worst kind of abduction. As far as watching your children 24 / 7 its impossible. Theses are crimes of opportunity. Your best defense is knowledge. Eyes and ears. Start watching and asking questions. Make your children, their friends, your friends & neighbors aware. Who fits and who doesn't. I would like to tell you this was the only time in my life where something like this happened. I block a lot of it. I just remember the number of times then the circumstances. Walking home from school, walking home from the store with a friend age 12 attempted sexual disfigurement with a knife by a stranger, at camp age 15, family friends age 7, 8. Sexual touching, sexual assault, interference, sexual advances by adults and other children. They recruit with other kids. The threat is always there. Be aware and be less of a target and be safe. I let my kids walk to school. Get out of the car and talk to other parents.

Well, predictably, the conspiracy nut jobs are weaving their fantasies again.
Yep, just about the the whole town was 'in on it'.  You betcha.  
The parents of the abducted boy, and the RCMP, and the people who were out there pretending to look for him, etc, etc.
Good grief what tripe!  Just what is it that you people smoke or pump into your veins that gives you these delusions?

My Opinion

Why would a man guilty of child abduction risk coming back to the scene of the crime to return the child? Why would he believe that the fathers request as not a set up? What criminal would ever do such a thing? It makes no sense. Then on top of it that their is 150 police working 20 hour days looking for this man and boy plus hundreds of volunteers to not notice him come back regardless of the time there is way too many people looking for them for him to think he could sneak back to the house to drop off the boy.

@Christian, Grow up!  Just because you and your whole town appear to have been taken in by an implausible story, no need to make stupid threats.....Either you have a town filled with incredibly gullable/incompetent RCMP, that allowed a suspect to flee to another Province within 24 hours of returning to a crime scene or there is some serious BS stenching from your town....I'll say it's a bit of both.

There is no way he was abducted.  Give my a historic example in the last 10 years where this has occured.  No way!  Not saying Hopley doen't have a past of bad, but no way is he the guy.  People - think about this logically!  There is just no way!




 








Peace be unto you.

I too think it is odd that the doors were left unlocked that a sleep walking child might exit.  Especially when the children are homeschooled because the parents don't feel school is safe for their kids.  If you are of afraid of school in the day, surely you would be afraid of the dark?
Something seems fishy about the whole situation.  Before this, did anyone have a clue that the child was a sleep walker... is there any proir documented walk?

If Mr. Hopley did it, are we certain there was no accomplice?    Anyone might have taken him back.  Who made the call?  Was the child not returned clothed, fed, watered etc.  This just doesn't add up.

I'm glad this guy is off the streets and just baffled by many comments made including some of my own.  The young boy is home, safe I'm hoping and a thieving, woman beater with a long record that cost tax payers a load of money is off the streets to cost tax payers a few more bucks.{ If you insist on keeping people like him around, at least make use of them and use them for blood cows (monitored blood supply) and lab rats to find cures for diseases and stop testing on animals.....}

All you people screaming conspiracy and saying the family set this up or whatever nonsense that comes out of your idiot minds, I would like to extend an invitation to you all to come to the Elk Valley where this boy was abducted and we'll see what you have to say to our faces!!!! They may have found Hopley but they'll never find you:)

As despicable as his crime was, please, let's not forget, that he was one in a million, in that he returned the little boy, safe and sound.  And by the looks of him playing, not too worse the wear.  He doesn't look like he was abused. He's smiling etc.  So,,a bit of compassion please.  This guy, looks, well, like he's not playing with a full deck.  And did you see his mother?  sighs,,,,

I don't trust the father and I have a horrible feeling that this obvious mental retard Hopley has been set up for a fall on this one.....DNA on the child or the lack of DNA on the child should reveal the truth.  The RCMP have been lead by the nose on this one.  Child psychologists and intense sessions with the child should reveal the truth.

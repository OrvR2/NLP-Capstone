Still looking for the good old free press release distribution express-press-release.net (formerly express-press-release.com), now part of  EPR Network, used to offer in the past? Relax, we are back!!! Having received thousands of emails (literally) over the past 2 years, since we have discontinued our free distribution (Nov 2008), asking for the popular free Express Press Release Distribution from the past we have finally made our mind and decided on bringing it back! You can again have your press releases distributed for free via EPR Network over here: http://express-press-release.net/free.  Try it out for yourself – it’s free.
Care to read more?
Many of you may not know that express-press-release.com used to be one of the busiest free press release distribution services in the not so distant past (circa 2008) until we had to discontinue our free web based wire service due to the growth we had experienced at the time.
At the time express-press-release.com, part of EPR Network, had experienced a tremendous increase of the number of free press release submissions (in excess of 10,000 per month), which resulted in our inability to catch it up with the growth having them distributed in timely manner, which literally undermined our company’s motto “express press release”. Bringing no economical benefits to the company from releasing such a massive number of free PR materials across the Web each month has effectively left us with little to no room to properly scale our system up and catch up with the rapidly growing demand for our free PR service. On the other hand heavily relying on human editors (due to the increased number of abusive users) for personal review of each single PR material received for free at EPR Network prior to sending it out to the public did effectively increase our business expenditures leaving us with no choice, but to discontinue our free service.
At the time we just realized that we wanted to shift the focus from our free distribution service and relocate some more human and other resources to our already growing number of paying clients in order to keep it up with the quality of service those clients were already getting used to. It also reflected our belief that $29 per release is fair enough taking into consideration the quality of the featured press release distribution service, the personal touch, the dedicated customer service provided, the number of sites and places the client’s PR is published on and released via, the relevant blog coverage, the social media submissions and much more EPR Network offers.
Today, the situation is quite different already. Having grown significantly from the times we had to stop our free wire service, we have meanwhile managed to scale up both our system and operational capabilities and we believe we are again ready to accomodate the massive number of users looking for quality yet free press releases distribution service online. And here we go, welcome to EPR Network’s free press release distribution service @ http://express-press-release.net/free

						The Diner is Closed. Again.

It’s official. I weaned Zoe.
For months I’ve wondered when this day would come, but I wasn’t in any hurry. We’ve talked about it for months, and it was my recent 5 day trip to Iowa that sealed the deal.
I don’t have anything profound to say about it, and I know that those who haven’t or haven’t been able to nurse their babies may not understand how much I’ll miss that special time with her, how much I loved when she fell asleep on my lap.
Rachel and Claire pretty much weaned themselves at a little over a year old. Here’s a little piece I wrote for them back in April 2009.
The diner is closed.  Well, it actually closed a few weeks ago.  We did it very gradually, with our favorite customers slowly decreasing the amount of time spent in the diner.  Then they started coming fewer times during the day, maybe only hanging around long enough for a quick cup of coffee as opposed to a full meal.  From time to time they misbehaved, resulting in their getting kicked out of the diner. Eventually they were just coming in for the comfort of the booths, maybe grabbing a handful of peanuts before heading back out the door to their busy lives.
The diner’s history was bumpy and difficult in the beginning, but once the owner and the customers got to know each other, things began to run like a well oiled machine.  Then one day the customers just didn’t need to come back.  They found another regular spot with a much more extensive menu, and it seems much more fun to eat there.  At the new place you can even throw your food on the floor (a little — don’t go crazy or anything).
So eventually the diner had to let go its faithful staff.  It turned off the neon sign one last time and closed its doors for good with a resounding click of the lock.
It was a challenge, but I’m really going to miss running the diner.

Weaning my son over the months afte he turned one went very gradually and very naturally. The last 2 feedings went away as a result of simply not having the opportunity to nurse him at the particular time. So I just said, well, I guess we’re done with that feeding.
It really is odd when it’s over.  Luckily for me, my little man was still very cuddly, so it wasn’t like going cold turkey.

Yes, luckily it’s been very gradual for her too. Just pre nap and bedtime. Unfortunately since I got back in town she thinks the diner’s open again!

I’m glad the weaning went off without a hitch. I weaned my son at 18 months, and really, it was easier than I thought it would be. It was harder on me than him!!

I’ve been ready, but not. She’s having kind of a hard time since I got back, but she’ll get through it.

It’s a strange thing to miss but I know exactly what you mean. And find myself completely incapable of describing it to others.

i thought I would miss running “the diner” when Monkey weaned, but it was such a natural process that we just moved on and I never looked back. It was funny how uninterested he was in the two things that used to be his favorite in the world!

The “turning off its neon sign” part made me say, “Awww!”

GAH… that got me!
I’m a sappy mess over here.
How bittersweet my friend. I know how much you loved it and how hard this chapter is for you to close.
If it helps… my toddler TRIED to breast feed last night (WTF???)

Awww.  I was only able to nurse my son for 2 months so I understand how hard it is to let it go. 
But just think, now you can have your wine without worrying about it!

I miss nursing sometimes, even now. Not actually nursing, because it kind of sucked (pun completely intended) but the closeness with the little guys. Yeah, I miss that.

I wasn’t able to breastfeed my girls for very long and it was always with an SNS system. I only had 3-6 months each time but I do know that bond. It was the best thing about BFing. It is the reason I endured that damn SNS contraption for as long as I did. It’s the same reason that if I had another,I;d do it again. It;s Ok to be a little sad about the special time. I love the post putting it in the perspective a if it were a restaurant, so cute.

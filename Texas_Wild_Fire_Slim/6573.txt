By Bruce Nolan
c. 2011 Religion News Service
(RNS) It's not news that young people are more liberal on issues like same-sex marriage, but a new poll charts just how deeply that split has been carved into the white evangelical community, one of the most socially conservative groups on the American religious landscape.

The poll, released in late August by the Washington-based Public Religion Research Institute, found that nearly half (44 percent) of young evangelicals between the ages of 18 to 29 favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry.

By contrast, the white evangelical community as a whole (even counting those relatively liberal young adults) is solidly opposed to same-sex marriage, by slightly more than 80 percent.

More broadly, the poll found "at least a 20-point generation gap between millennials (age 18-29) and seniors (65 and over) on every public policy measure in the survey concerning rights for gay and lesbian people."

The poll also found that a slight majority of all Catholics (52 percent) favor same-sex marriage, despite the energetic teaching of
their church to the contrary.

The PRRI poll confirmed findings from other polls over the last five years that Americans have come to a tipping point on the issue of same-sex marriage: either equally divided (47 percent, according to the PRRI poll) or slightly in favor.

"This is the first year that support for allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry is not a minority position," said Robert P. Jones, CEO of Public Religion Research Institute.

The survey of 3,000 U.S. adults has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points; the margin for young adult responses is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

(Bruce Nolan writes for The Times-Picayune in New Orleans.)

				Slightly off topic, but this is not a rhetorical question and I figured somebody who frequents these boards would have an idea:
Why the push for "gay marriage" vs. "domestic partnershi­p" (or similar) with equivalent rights?
It seems like if the push had been for partnershi­p, this whole debate would've been settled 10 years ago (at least); it doesn't raise religious hackles (or less, anyway), DOMA would be a non-issue, and, if crafted properly, would give all the rights of marrieds (inheritan­ce, community property, custody, etc.).  Additional­ly, it avoids the criticisms I've heard (from gays, mostly!) that state recognitio­n of "gay marriage" betrays a sort of inferiorit­y complex: if I have to get the state to recognize my union, or I feel like a "2nd class citizen", then maybe I'm a little insecure in my identity or relationsh­ips.  It's one thing to push for rights, another to push for a word.  Why has domestic partnershi­p disappeare­d off the radar?

				Fanned and faved. Amazing, isn't it? They want us to be content with a second-cla­ss status and selfishly keep the world marriage to themselves­. When I went to Canada, I contracted a MARRIAGE. That is what it is and what it remains. I refuse to use another word for my marriage simply to keep the bigoted happy. I am a law-abidin­g, tax-paying US citizen and there is no reason to give my committed relationsh­ip some separate but equal term. I, like you, am an adult and claim the right to call my marriage what it is--a MARRIAGE.

				Actually I advocate that the government get out of the marriage business entirely. The right wing says that gays can't be married because marriage is a religious institutio­n and is a sacrement. If that is true, then why is our secular government even involved in granting marriages at all.

I think that the only thing the state grants and recognizes is a civil union. Go to the county courthouse­, swear an oath, and pay a fee of course, and you are done as far as the state is concerned. If anybody then want to go to their house of worship, or nature preserve, or their own backyard, or on the 50 yard line during half time at the Super Bowl and have a marriage ceremony, that is entirely their personal decision. 

Of course on the flip side people, could get a religious marriage in their homophobic church and eshue getting a civil union from the state that recognizes civil unions for any two people and that would be just fine. They would just be married in the eyes of God and single in the eyes of the State.

				Because those other unions DON'T come with "equivalen­t rights". Check out the wording of some of the States' legislatio­ns that outlawed them - some specifical­ly banning ANY of "the effects that flow from marriage" to any other union "resemblin­g marriage". THAT'S why. (And of course, this doesn't even begin to address the 1,176 Federal benefits. So you myth of this being settled 10 years ago is a false assertion. They don't want us to HAVE equal rights/fre­edoms/bene­fits/respo­nsibilitie­s.

Why should I give a hoot who's "religious hackles" are raised? What about MINE? (Not all the 'religious­' are anti-gay or anti-equal­ity. My church is fine with same-gende­r marriage.) Doesn't Amreica 'promise' freedom of religion to ALL citizens anymore?

DOMA will ALWAYS remain "an issue" since it EXEMPTS ITSELF from provisions of the Constituti­on (thus rendering it UN-Constit­utional). Or shouldn't the Constituti­on apply to gay citizens?

Since your preferred version of "domestic partnershi­ps" DOESN'T "give all the rights of marrieds", why create a whole 'new' institutio­n when MARRIAGE does that already?

I've never heard a single gay person say what you say you've "heard" - NOT ONE!

				I love hearing all this talk of civil unions from the right since even when civil unions have been on the ballot, they have fought those just as vociferous­ly as marriage equality. I reject civil unions as a matter of principle but find the lies of the right interestin­g. "Oh, well, if you would call them civil unions I would be fine with that" (as if it should be up to them what I call my marriage) and then when civil unions are up for a vote, they get just as bigoted about those as about marriage.

				That younger generation watched the older generation (including their own parents and grandparen­ts) divorce, remarry, repeat, use contracept­ives and disregard church teachings whenever they found it convenient to do so.

Now, that younger generation is seeing the older generation cruelly deny marriage for gay couples, many of whom are in loving and committed relationsh­ips. The younger generation is smart and more socially-c­onscious than their predecesso­rs; they are not fans of the hypocrisy and double-sta­ndards...t­hey want to see progress.

				Any man that cautiously and warmly receives the issue of Spiritual Salvation for His Soul, he battles and succeeds, he flourishes and bears fruit, and he feeds on Spirituali­ty and is full of Angelic Happiness. I am very happy when I see souls battle the many demons that have accumulate­d into society, God that is Just and Fair has given all of us the tools to succeed. No one climes a latter into the sky without Spiritual Awareness, if we humble ourselves, we walk with security; we walk with guarantees and never fall. As much as we are able, we should uproot all the unattracti­ve earthly desires that lead to Spiritual failure. We should be disgusted with unjust human desires and immorality­, this way we can sincerely and honestly love our Savoir, our Lord Jesus will a complete heart.  The more we correct our self’s and relate with God, and commit to the Will of God, the more we become Hid children and receive the endless fountain of Salvation.

Vanguard finally joins the Friday night football party

Duane A. Laverty / Waco Tribune-Herald
Vanguard coach Joe Beard (right) said he has had to focus on the most basic fundamentals as the Vikings prepare for their first season.

 
For what seems like forever, Vanguard students have been saddled with their own unique identifier.
Whenever they’d encounter other students around Waco and get asked where they went to school, they were prepared for the inevitable response.
“Oh, Vanguard? You’re the school with no football team, right?”
Not anymore, pal. Beginning this fall, a new era dawns at Vanguard — an era accompanied by the grunts of trench warfare and the crack of shoulder pads colliding with helmets.
Football has arrived at Vanguard, all right, and the students couldn’t be more grateful.
“People look at Vanguard more of an academic school than a sports school,” said junior David Copeland, who will play offensive lineman and linebacker for the Vikings. “I think that’s changed a bit now.”
Just in time
Clay Herbort’s last football action played out at McGregor High School three years ago. The next year, he transferred to Vanguard, and had to hang up the pads.
Until now.
“It’s been rumored for two years now, and it’s relieving to finally have it,” said Herbort, the team’s lone senior. “I can’t wait to get out there for the first game and to be able to play our first year. Growing up in Texas, it’s such a big deal to play football.”
Since its launch in 1973, Vanguard College Preparatory School has sought to stretch and challenge its students to prepare them for their eventual university experience. The school has also fielded some successful athletic teams in sports like basketball, baseball and golf, but always left football to its public and private school rivals around McLennan County.
Sensing a growing interest from students and parents, Vanguard administrators voted to add football to the school’s athletic program last year. In April, Vanguard hired Joe Beard, a Waco native who played football for Richfield High and SMU, as its inaugural head coach.
Of course, there are numerous challenges when you’re building from the ground floor. Beard said Vanguard is “baking from scratch,” and as any chef knows, that process is bound to get a little messy.
“There are a handful of kids who have played before at other schools or who have had youth football experience,” Beard said. “But it’s still going to take a while to get the mentality right. They don’t understand the pace of the game, every aspect of it.
‘Not a video game’
“It’s not a video game. It’s not a correspondence course. It doesn’t work that way.”
Because many of the players are rookies to the gridiron, Vanguard’s preseason practices have provided a crash course in Football 101. Beard and his two assistants, his son Jody Beard and Zach Seifert, demonstrate every aspect of the game’s fundamentals, from blocking and tackling techniques to footwork and even sideline etiquette.
During one recent postpractice meeting, Beard stopped his speech to gently chastise a player who was sitting on his helmet.
“We never sit on our helmet, son. Always a knee,” the coach said.
“It’s very much like youth football, starting out with the absolute basics,” Beard said. “Our goal is, first of all, to teach the basics to these kids and have that solid football background or base. And then we want to be physical when we get onto the field.”
The physicality of football is something Vanguard’s players are growing to anticipate and appreciate. It’s been suggested that football isn’t a contact sport, it’s a collision sport, and like most teams the Vikings have plenty of players who are willing to butt heads.
“The most fun part of football? Probably just the hitting,” said Copeland, who played football at Live Oak in junior high. “Everybody says that, but it’s true.”
For now, Vanguard is playing six-man football in TAPPS Division I, in a district that includes Round Rock Christian, Austin Hill Country and Temple Holy Trinity.
Beard said eventually the school, which has an annual enrollment of around 180 students in grades 7-12, would prefer to shift to 11-man football, but that move is down the road.
The Vikings will play their home games at Parkview Christian Academy’s field, typically on Saturday afternoons.
Yet even a bunch of football newbies playing on a borrowed field are prone to big dreams.
“We have a lot of high expectations for ourselves,” Herbort said. “A lot of start-up programs don’t have much success from the get-go, just because they’re inexperienced or because of other things. But we’re good athletes who really want to get to the next level as quickly as possible. We’re going to try to be competitive instantly.”
Tough opponents
It won’t be easy. Vanguard’s schedule includes games against the likes of Live Oak, a third-year varsity program that went 11-1 in 2010, and Aquilla, a UIL state semifinalist and rabid six-man haven.
“The kids are going to learn from experience,” Beard said. “When we go play Aquilla here in a few weeks and they run into one of these country boy teams where the guys have been out all summer throwing hay and all that, they’re going to learn. That’s part of it.”
The Vikings may have much to learn, but at least they’re willing students. Beard said that partially because of the blank canvas with which the team started, visible progress is made daily. The coach is also enthusiastic about the number of players who have turned out for the junior high team, the nucleus of Vanguard’s varsity teams of tomorrow.
Even Vikings can’t conquer the world overnight. This bunch probably won’t, either.
But they can’t say Vanguard is not a football school anymore.
“It’s not just the football team, it’s getting the whole school involved,” Beard said. “It’s getting the administration behind us, the teachers behind us, the other kids behind us. It’s having those games on the weekends in the fall that they haven’t had before. Something the school can rally around, that takes on a bit of prestige.”

Years of public appeals, pleas of innocence and international support have yet to prevent what may be Troy Davis' fate: Prison officials in Georgia have set the date of execution for Davis, one of the highest-profile inmates on the state's death row. 
It is the fourth time in as many years that officials have set such a date. This time the date is September 21.
Davis, convicted of the 1989 killing of an off-duty Savannah police officer, has steadfastly maintained his innocence. In the decades since his conviction, his case has become somewhat of a cause célèbre, with former President Jimmy Carter, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and even Pope Benedict XVI, among others, having urged the courts to grant Davis a new trial. Family members have poured their hearts and souls into Davis' case. Advocacy groups rallied. Letter-writing campaigns were launched. 
Earlier this year the U.S. Supreme Court turned down what likely was Davis' last set of appeals. In 2009, Davis, by filing an original writ of habeas corpus to the Supreme Court, convinced the justices to order a federal court in Georgia to look into new evidence that he said would establish his innocence. By then, according to reports, several of the witnesses had recanted their earlier testimony that Davis had gunned down officer Mark MacPhail in a Burger King parking lot that night 20 years earlier.
The new hearing in June of 2010 gave Davis a chance to present new evidence that might help his case. He chose not to take the stand or call on witnesses who had given statements on his behalf.
Journalist Patrick Rodgers, who covered the trial for Connect Savannah, an alternative newspaper, wrote at the time:
[I]f the gauge of success was establishing clarity, the results were less than satisfactory. Even with all the preparation, when the hearing concluded, the facts seemed more obscured than ever –- twisted up by two days of contradictory testimonies that never really answered the only real question left. Who did it?
Judge William T. Moore Jr., the trial judge, concluded that Davis' evidence was "largely smoke and mirrors," according to a New York Times article from earlier this year. The Supreme Court refused to review Moore's ruling.
 Fast-forward a year and a couple months, and again Davis stands at a crossroads, perhaps his last. If all goes as planned, Davis will be put to death at 7:00 pm, two Wednesdays from now.

				I recently watched a special on netflix streamline­, frontline special...­.96% of all death row inmates either from the beginning or with in thier incarcerat­ion time they admit thier guilt, and ask for forgivenes­s, also there are 1.3% of them have been found not guilty after thier execution, due to dna evidence..­.Which begs me to suggest that is it ok to send even 1 man to death with out 100% sureity of his guilt, I know many people will argue this fact, and thier are many victims families out there who need justice, but even 1 man to be put to death is to many....

Of those executed, 12 were female. (The last was Teresa Wilson Lewis in Virginia on September 23, 2010).

Of those executed, 718 (57%) were white and 429 (34%) were black.

Executions were held in 34 different states: 473 (37%) were in Texas and 20 (1.5%) were in Indiana.

Of those executed:

1092 (86%) were executed by lethal injection, including 616 of the last 626 executions­.

				It's sad that you see abolition as a racial issue. When will you ever stop? You've been doing this ever since OJ. It was not race that acquitted OJ. It was your own jury system. One of the greatest abolitioni­sts besides Frederick Douglas was White. We want to abolish state sanctioned murder for all.

				I took the time to read the comments here since I was not familiar with the case.  I was appalled to see many felt the execution was only taking place because of color. I posted the stats to show (and added a comment as well) to say this is not about race but guilt or innocents. 
I am not a jury member, but I must wonder why after winning an appeal to give the true facts, he choose to sit on them.  No, this does not make him guilty but you have to wonder what he was thinking.

				Hey were talking an Southern State, where they support there prosecutor­s one hundred percent,
even when the evidence provided has been proven beyound a resoanble doubt to be false.
The South is ripe with such cases. They protect there Prosecutor­s and all members of there Law Enforcment employees, wweather they be police,  Prosecutor­s or sham scientists who have not graduated from the 5th grade. Its all family down there from the Judges on down. And no one is going to question family becuse it would open the whole system to outside investigat­ion and they would all at least be out of jobs if not in jail, with the people they put there.

				Maybe he is guilty, but, what if he isn't? How many people have been put to death that are later found innocent! Does the PA, judge, jury, goverment, and all involved and could have spared him become the killer. I know some are going to say thats God's problem, others are going to deny him and that is thier privelage. I for one don't want to be in there shoes when he is killed, murdered, same thing! Judged by a jury of his peers, look it up according to Webster. 
I wish him luck either way, and I am sure it will make some happy and others sad. Did he do it or not.

How do you know "he would have eventually done something similar" ?  So using your argument that would mean since you've never killed anyone then the government should put you in prison and eventually put you to death because what the heck you "would have eventually done something similar."  So the government should "just zap 'you' and save 'us' a few tax dollars." 
Were you dropped on your head as a baby or child...co­uld that possibly explain your thought process?

				What kind of people are we, that we would vigorously applaud when the NBC moderator mentions Rick Perry's killing of so many people in his state?

Are we really like the Romans who applauded when Christians­(then considered dangerous criminals) were put to death in public?

				Reading the wikipedia page it is unfortunat­e to see evidence like "A man wearing a white shirt", "a homeless man found the bullet casing later" and "a former cell mate testified"­. These all reek of a potential setup. Some of the other items, including a pair of shorts not admitted into evidence, and his statement requesting "a second chance" are pretty bad news. I would prefer the DP be reserved for cases with multiple, unimpeacha­ble eye witnesses, but here we are.

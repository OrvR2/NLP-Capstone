Support intensified Tuesday for ranchers and law enforcement officials hustling to get hundreds of horses and other livestock away from the devastating Bastrop County wildfires.Five horses are believed to have died in the blaze already and more deaths are expected.“I'd say a significant amount of cattle may be lost,” said Bill Hyman, executive director of the Independent Cattlemen's Association of Texas. “You just don't know.”Tommy Cooper, a Bastrop County sheriff's deputy who's overseeing the livestock rescue effort, and other officials spent Tuesday taking calls from landowners already displaced by the fire who needed help moving their animals to safety. Those officials and volunteers got more than 100 horses and about 40 head of cattle moved to the Lost Pines Rodeo Arena in Elgin.Bastrop had a temporary shelter for livestock opened until they were relocated Monday when the fire got too close. Officials said the J.B. Wells Park arena in Gonzales and the auction barn in Hills Prairie south of Bastrop also were holding evacuated livestock.Rachel Bauer, agricultural agent for the Texas AgriLife Extension Service in Bastrop County, said officials were flooded with calls from across the state offering transportation for animals, land and pens where the livestock could be held and feed for the animals that were displaced.“It is truly incredible to see so many people volunteering their time, vehicles and land to help those devastated by these disastrous fires,” said Bryan Black, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Agriculture, which dispatched officials to Bastrop on Tuesday.A Facebook page was established to spread information about the resources available to livestock owners. Additional information was available on Twitter from ranchers who had space to hold evacuated livestock or trailers who could move animals.Hyman said association members who had gotten assistance after Hurricane Ike destroyed fences and washed away hay were returning the favor by sending in bales of hay for cattle and other evacuated livestock to eat.“They're digging down pretty deep to help,” Hyman said.The situation could have been worse, but many ranchers had already sold off half or more of their herds because the drought had made it too costly to feed the animals.Cooper couldn't estimate how many livestock the wildfire would claim, but he said “there's going to be some losses. There's no way around that.”Bauer said other resources, including trucks to haul water to livestock still in fields, will be needed as the emergency continues. Anyone interested in making donations can call Rachel Bauer at 512-468-7953 or Deputy Tommy Cooper at 512-227-4810.

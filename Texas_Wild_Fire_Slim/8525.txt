Another Lockerbie trial? Gadhafi’s downfall spurs new calls for bomber’s extraditionBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Tue, Aug 23, 2011With the fall of Libya's Moammar Gadhafi regime widely anticipated, some American lawmakers are calling anew on Libyan opposition leaders to agree to turn over the Libyan official who was convicted in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, 59, a reported former Libyan intelligence officer, was convicted by a Scottish court in 2001 for the bombing and sentenced to life in prison.Convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdulbaset al-Megrahi appears at pro-Gadhafi rally on July …
Scottish authorities released Megrahi two years ago and allowed him to return to Libya, citing compassion because Megrahi supposedly was dying within weeks of cancer. Megrahi received a hero's welcome upon his return to Libya. The United States government as well as some of the Lockerbie victims' families denounced the deal; several American lawmakers have since raised concerns that it was done less on any medical-legal basis than to benefit British business interests in Libya, including those of British Petroleum.  The British government has of course denied that to be the case. (The 2009 return of Megrahi to Libya occurred under then British prime  minister Tony Blair and was opposed at the time by David Cameron, the  current Conservative Party British prime minister who was then serving as an opposition member of Parliament.)
Not only has Megrahi not died in the two years since he was returned to Libya, but last year a British doctor involved in the medical recommendation said that Megrahi probably had a 50 percent chance of living several more months, maybe even years.
Last month, Megrahi--apparently very much alive--was seen on video attending a pro-Gadhafi rally in Tripoli (see the photo on the top right).Read More »Some rebel claims in doubt as Gadhafi son appears at Tripoli hotelBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Tue, Aug 23, 2011Gadhafi's son Seif al-Islam waves to troops loyal to his father in Tripoli Tuesday. (Dario …The Libyan rebels' heady claims to have seized most of the capital of Tripoli and to have detained three of Moammar Gadhafi's sons were cast in doubt Tuesday when Gadhafi's son and heir apparent Seif al-Islam pulled up in a limousine at Tripoli's Rixos hotel. He proceeded to take foreign journalists staying there on a tour of neighborhoods he claimed were still under the control of the Gadhafi regime.
An apparently embarrassed National Transition Council--the Libyan opposition body--offered a confusing explanation Tuesday for its claim on Sunday to have detained Seif as well as two other Gadhafi brothers, blaming the misinformation on a "fifth column" of traitors posing as rebels.
"There was misinformation intentionally put  out by fifth column people to discredit the NTC and they were  successful," NTC spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said Tuesday, Reuters reported. "They  should not have come out with an announcement until they had seen him  in handcuffs in front of them. They came out with it based on  someone's misinformation and took it at face value."
Astonished foreign journalists including CNN's Matthew Chance posted photos to Twitter of Seif coming into the Rixos hotel.  (You can see Seif's triumphal appearance in the video below.)
 
"We broke the backbone of the rebels," Seif boasted to reporters, according to the Washington Post. "We gave them a hard time.   And so we are winning." He then proceeded to invite reporters "to accompany him 'to the   hottest places in Tripoli,'" the Post report continued.
Western diplomats said that this was not the first time that rebel claims had been found to be exaggerated.Read More »Daily planet: Rebel euphoria fadesBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Tue, Aug 23, 2011Rebel fighters observe fighting near the main Moammar Gadhafi compound in Bab Al-Aziziya …• Seif al-Islam Gadhafi, one of Moammar Gadhafi's sons who Libyan rebels claimed Sunday to have detained, shows up Monday at Tripoli hotel used by foreign journalists, putting rebel claims in doubt.

But he avoided any "Mission Accomplished" triumphalism during a press conference broadcast from his vacation rental farm in Martha's Vineyard, Mass. Obama cautioned that the fight for democracy in Libya has not ended.
"The situation is still very fluid, there remains a  degree of uncertainty, and there are still regime elements who pose a  threat," Obama said. "But this much is clear: the Gadhafi regime is coming to an end and the future of Libya is in the hands of its people."

"I  want to emphasize that this is not over yet," Obama stressed, adding that "as the regime  collapses,  there is still fierce fighting in some areas and we have  reports of  regime elements threatening to continue fighting." He also urged Libya's opposition National Transition Council to avoid reprisal violence.
Post-conflict experts echoed the president's caution, warning that the surprisingly smooth entry of Libyan rebels into the capital of Tripoli overnight could be overshadowed quickly if the rebels are unable to restore law and order on the streets of Libya, as well as to provide unglamorous public services like trash collection, electricity and water.
"It is as if the Libyans have climbed the mountain--and now see a mountain range in front of them," analogized the former United Nations post-conflict expert Mark Quarterman in an interview with The Envoy on Monday.Read More »Where is Gadhafi? Guessing game begins as an era ends in LibyaBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Mon, Aug 22, 2011(Enric Marti/AP)Where in the world is Moammar Gadhafi?
"He's  everywhere, he's nowhere; he's negotiating to get out, he will never  surrender; who knows?" former United Nations official Mark Quarterman said of the contradictory reports about Gadhafi's fate in an interview Monday with The Envoy.
What's important for  Libya's reconciliation process is not just that the dictator is on the way out, Quarterman stressed, but how he goes.
"Gadhafi's mode of leaving is very important," Quarterman, now with  the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told The Envoy. "If  he leaves but aspects of his regime stick around—-people who keep the  lights on,  and pick up the garbage, and they cooperate with the new  transitional authority, that's a good thing. ... But if there's chaos in  his wake," that would be very bad.

Mustafa Abdel-Jalil, leader of the Libyan opposition National Transition Council, triumphantly declared "the Gadhafi era is over" Monday as rebels poured into the capital of Tripoli, meeting sporadic fighting and pockets of resistance in certain neighborhoods.
The NTC said they had three of Gadhafi's sons in custody or under house arrest--including former heir apparent Seif al-Islam Gadhafi and Gadhafi's eldest son, Mohammed. (Those claims turned out not to be true however, as became evident when Seif appeared at the foreign journalists' Tripoli hotel early Tuesday and proceeded to take them on a tour of the parts of the capital he said were still under Gadhafi regime control.) They confessed however they had no idea of the whereabouts of the dictator who has brutally ruled the North African nation for almost 42 years.
British and French leaders also claimed Monday to be in the dark about Gadhafi's coordinates, and South Africa denied that the Libyan ruler had found refuge there.
"Bab al-Aziziya and the surrounding areas are still out of our control," Abdel-Jalil told journalists at a triumphant press conference in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi Monday, the Associated Press reported, referring to the Tripoli neighborhood where the Gadhafi compound in located. "We have no knowledge of Gadhafi being there, or whether he is  still in or outside Libya."Read More »

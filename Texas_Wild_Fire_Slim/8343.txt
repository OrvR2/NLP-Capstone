Anti-government protests swell in SwazilandAFP – 19 hrs ago

 More than 1,000 people marched peacefully Tuesday through Swaziland's main city Manzini in one of the largest protests yet against Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III.
Scores of riot police stood by as the protesters marched to the city centre but there was no sign of the repeat of the violence of April 12 when hundreds of teachers and students were dispersed with batons, teargas and water canons.
Anti-riot vehicles lined the protest route, and two security checkpoints were set up along the highway between the Manzini and the capital Mbabane, where about 500 people staged a similar protest Monday.
"Release our political prisoners, democracy now," read one placard waved by the crowd wearing red, the colour of workers and closely associated with Swaziland's banned opposition People's United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO).
Political parties have been banned since 1973 in Swaziland and Mswati holds ultimate executive, legislative and judicial power.
The protest Tuesday also marked Swaziland's independence from colonial power Britain in 1968.
However five years later, then-king Sobhuza abolished multi-party democracy and established himself as absolute ruler. His son, Mswati has continued in that tradition.
"It is independence day and we are saying we have nothing to do with it because where is our independence?" asked Sikelele Dlamini, head of the Swaziland Democracy Campaign, a coalition organising the week-long demonstrations.
The protesters were calling for "unbanning of political parties, release of all political prisoners (and) return of well over 500 exiles," PUDEMO said in a statement.
There were repeated cries of "Viva PUDEMO", in open defiance of Swaziland's anti-terrorism laws which punish anyone associating with the party.
"Clearly a new day is coming. The signs are there that people want change. If I were somebody in authority I would say, let us start talking now, let us have peaceful dialogue," said PUDEMO's president, Mario Masuku
Impoverished Swaziland is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, in a financial crisis that has spawned a series of protests this year to demand that Mswati accept multi-party democracy and resolve a budget crunch that has left the kingdom battling to keep schools and clinics running.
Until this year, public shows of dissent were rare in Swaziland, where the palace tolerates little criticism.
The protesters want the government to tax the royal investment firm Tibiyo Taka Ngwane, essentially controlled by Mswati and used to finance his lavish lifestyle, including luxury cars and palaces for his 13 wives.
South Africa is poised to sign a controversial $343 million (237 million euro) bailout to help ease the financial crisis in the kingdom, a move that has angered powerful labour unions who have thrown their support behind the protests.

I hope these protesters can overthrow their king. If the king gets brutal like Ghadafi or Assad than South Africa should go to war with them.

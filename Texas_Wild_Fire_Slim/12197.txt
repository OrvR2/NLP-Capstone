The Texas Forest Service wood technology program recognizes the importance of the forest-based wood industries to the Texas economy.  It is committed to the wise, efficient and sustainable utilization of wood and to obtaining the highest value from that portion of the forest resource allocated to timber production.  The program seeks to identify and promote innovation and new technologies in support of ongoing and new forest-based economic activities.  Additionally, the wood technology program aims to provide up-to-date information and assistance to Texas landowners, manufacturers, distributors and the public on topics related to the utilization of wood and the manufacturing and marketing of wood products.  In support of these activities a Directory of Forest Products Industries in Texas was created and is maintained by the Texas Forest Service.Please click on the topics listed below for additional information pertaining to each:BTUs Wood palletsThe following photographs provide current examples of end-uses for wood products.Use of engineered wood products such as trusses and oriented strandboard (OSB) in residential construction in East Texas.

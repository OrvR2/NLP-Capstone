Dirt is a part of life. Whether its grime or dust, it envelops even the most ordinary of circumstances or objects. Wellcome Collection’s exhibition, Dirt: the Filthy Reality of Everyday Life, takes a closer look by bringing together close to 200 artifacts. From a carpet created from home dusts, to anthropometric module made from human feces, this exhibition brings together disgust and delight. 
Dirt: the Filthy Reality of Everyday Life, will show until the 31st of August, 2011 at Wellcome Collection, 183 Euston Road, London NW1 2BE.

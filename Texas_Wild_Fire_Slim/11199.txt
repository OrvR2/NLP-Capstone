		Amir Sayoud's epically poor performance at the penalty spot may garner him more attention than anything else he accomplishes in football.

Visualization is supposedly an important part of any player's routine before striding up to the ball for a penalty shot. It's still a safe bet, though, that this soccer player didn't have his spectularly awful effort in mind.
During match between Al-Ahly and Kima Aswan in the Egypt Cup, Algerian striker Amir Sayoud took what might possibly be one of the worst penalty shots you'll ever see. Sayoud appeared to attempt to fake out the keeper by doing a stutter step before shooting, but then lost his balance. He fell after barely getting a shot off. 
To add insult to embarrassment, Sayoud was given a yellow card for "disregarding the opponent."
According to Ahram Online, Pedro, Ahly's assistant coach, said that “Sayoud needs more experience, that’s all."
Not sure how much more experience Sayoud will have to accrue to live this down, but all the luck to him.
Ahly went on to win the match 4-0.
According to the Egyptian Gazette, political related riots broke out at the stadium after the match as anti-Muburak patrons clashed with police. Reportedly 130 people were injured during the riot, including over 70 policemen.

				Actually it wasn't for the stutter step. The referee was a FIFA referee so he knows the stutter step is allowed (or at least he should). Once the referee sees that the run is complete, there is to be no stopping with the kick, even if it is a mistake but instead of stopping completely he continued to try and kick it, earning him a yellow card.

				Not sure where you refereed, but the defensive team could not have been offside since all of them were behind the ball and the ball was played by their opponent.  

You may be arguing that they infringed on the penalty area prior to the kick being taken but the referee correctly recognized the kicker's action as a violation of the 2010 amendment by the IFAB to Law 14 to read:    "Feinting in the run-up to take a penalty kick to confuse opponents is permitted, however feinting to kick the ball once the player has completed his run-up is now considered an infringeme­nt of Law 14 and an act of unsporting behaviour for which the player must be cautioned.­" and stopped play as the cautionabl­e offense is the more serious infringeme­nt.

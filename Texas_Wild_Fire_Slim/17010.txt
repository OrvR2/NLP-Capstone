#rsrh QotD, EVERYBODY Hates The Greens Edition.

Walter Russell Mead, while in the process of idly kicking around feckless radical environmentalists:
Snail darters beware: green political cluelessness is about to rock your world.
The context – although it’s plenty good without it, really – is that Mead (who is almost certainly fibbing when he says ” I don’t actually enjoy tweaking the greens*”) is commenting on the quote-unquote ‘strategy’ of the professional environmental movement.  Said strategy?  Finding as many different ways as possible to have the excuse to line up in a row, scream “Bonsai!,**” and charge. 
And what do we know about Banzai charges?
That’s right.  They don’t [expletive deleted] work.
Moe Lane
*An absolutely forgivable fib.
**Yes, it’s actually “Banzai!”  Like I’m going to pass up that opportunity for a pun.

The background is from Maxfield Parrish's Ecstasy, and is (to the best to my knowledge) in the public domain.

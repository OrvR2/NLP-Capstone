Dave Krieger: A CU star is born: wide receiver Paul Richardson


Posted: Sun, 11 Sep 2011 19:29:44 MDT
It was a little hard for CU to focus on it after a heart-wrenching overtime loss to Cal, but a 175-pound, 19-year-old receiver put on a show no one in attendance on a spectacular Colorado late-summer afternoon is likely to forget.

Krieger: Broncos' Fox harbors no bitterness toward Raiders' Al Davis


Posted: Thu, 8 Sep 2011 07:51:31 MDT
Fifteen years and three weeks ago, John Fox walked away from his first job as an NFL defensive coordinator. His employers were the Oakland Raiders.

Dave Krieger: September means tryouts for the Rockies


Posted: Tue, 6 Sep 2011 00:08:25 MDT
With apologies to John Greenleaf Whittier, the saddest words of tongue and pen in baseball are "Wait till next year."
MEDIA ENCLOSURE: http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2011/0905/20110905__20110906_B01_SP06KRIEGER~p1.JPG




Dave Krieger: Waiver wire provides plenty of room for Broncos' improvement


Posted: Sun, 4 Sep 2011 00:38:15 MDT
The first thing you notice about the Broncos' initial 53-man roster of the John Elway front office era is the heavy representation of the class of 2011. Nine rookies made it, including eight of nine draft choices.



Dave Krieger: John Elway's biggest task &mdash; rebuilding Broncos' depth


Posted: Fri, 2 Sep 2011 15:01:47 MDT
John Elway has said repeatedly that the Broncos' new front office will have to stack  several strong drafts on top of one another to restore the franchise as an NFL contender.

Krieger: Nuggets' Ujiri feels Africa has basketball potential


Posted: Tue, 30 Aug 2011 23:23:04 MDT
Nuggets general manager Masai Ujiri would be in his native Africa this time of year anyway. He always is.

Krieger: Pro cycling in Colorado gets a boost from USA Challenge


Posted: Mon, 29 Aug 2011 09:45:48 MDT
Just across Colfax Avenue from city hall, 70-year-old Daniel Gomez sat on a concrete shelf,  resting an arm on his bicycle and watching the cycling world fly by.

Dave Krieger: O'Dowd must rebuild the Rockies' rotation


Posted: Sat, 27 Aug 2011 00:50:09 MDT
Complain all you want about Ian Stewart, Jose Lopez or the lack of clutch hitting. The root of the Rockies' disappointment in 2011 was the implosion of their starting pitching.



Dave Krieger: Tim Tebow's third-string role with Broncos a polarizing issue


Posted: Tue, 23 Aug 2011 02:15:06 MDT
Tim Tebow didn't play much Saturday night, but his FRS energy drink ad certainly did. Nothing against the ad, which played relentlessly on the local telecast of the Broncos' preseason victory over Buffalo. As energy drink ads go, it's a pretty good one.



Dave Krieger: Broncos' Brady Quinn deserves status as No. 2 quarterback


Posted: Sun, 21 Aug 2011 09:24:58 MDT
John Elway broke the news on Twitter as gently as he could. "Looking forward to seeing our QBs tonight," he tweeted just before kickoff Saturday night. "Tim went in after Kyle last week, and Brady will go second tonight. All competing."

Krieger: Late NFL cuts can be Broncos' treasure


Posted: Thu, 18 Aug 2011 20:57:21 MDT
It's looking more and more like Sept. 3 will be one of the biggest player personnel dumps in NFL history, with nearly 1,200 players coming on the market at once.

Dave Krieger: Broncos would do well to release Perrish Cox


Posted: Tue, 16 Aug 2011 18:33:55 MDT
If you're wondering why cornerback Perrish Cox is still on the Broncos' roster, you're not alone.
MEDIA ENCLOSURE: http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2011/0722/20110722__20110723_A01_CD23COX~p1.JPG




Krieger: Starting Orton over Tebow is a vote for Broncos' credibility


Posted: Wed, 3 Aug 2011 23:54:54 MDT
Now that trading Kyle Orton has proved easier said than done, the Broncos are back to their original problem, only more so.



Krieger: Rox need overhaul in a hurry


Posted: Sun, 31 Jul 2011 23:28:22 MDT
General manager Dan O'Dowd has much more to do if he's going to restock — his word — the Rockies into a team with a fighting chance next year.



Dave Krieger: One inning a bad way to end it for Jimenez


Posted: Sun, 31 Jul 2011 00:32:17 MDT
The memory of Ubaldo's final start in a Rockies uniform will be hard to shake. How the Rocks could do that to the best pitcher they ever had is difficult to fathom.



Krieger: Broncos, Orton, Dolphins wait on money and draft-pick details


Posted: Fri, 29 Jul 2011 15:45:53 MDT
The Broncos, Dolphins and Kyle Orton are sitting at a poker table. Orton is the only one who doesn't appear to be bluffing.
MEDIA ENCLOSURE: http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2011/0728/20110728__20110729_C08_SP29KRIEGERJSP29~p1.JPG




Krieger: QB Kyle Orton's salary too much to bear for Broncos


Posted: Wed, 27 Jul 2011 00:16:46 MDT
Trying to trade Kyle Orton is one thing. Succeeding is something else. The Broncos have known this for a while.
MEDIA ENCLOSURE: http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2010/0801/20100801__Korton080110~p1.jpg




Krieger: Broncos offensive coordinator Mike McCoy gets his chance to call the shots


Posted: Sun, 24 Jul 2011 23:27:35 MDT
The Broncos' 2011 offense will be quite different from the 2010 version because pass-happy head coach Josh McDaniels has been replaced by run-happy head coach John Fox.
MEDIA ENCLOSURE: http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2011/0119/20110119__Mmccoy011911~p1.jpg




Krieger: Broncos' Kelly uses experience to help struggling kids


Posted: Sun, 24 Jul 2011 00:38:21 MDT
Once a man has made a commitment to a way of life, he puts the greatest strength in the world behind him. It's something we call heart power. Once a man has made this commitment, nothing will stop him short of success.
MEDIA ENCLOSURE: http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2011/0724/20110724_123813_krieger.jpg




Krieger: Rockies' Ubaldo Jimenez trade would have to be blockbuster


Posted: Mon, 18 Jul 2011 07:54:24 MDT
After another disheartening day at the ballyard, it's about time to admit that the unthinkable has become thinkable. The Rockies have a Ubaldo dilemma.



Krieger: Xanders gets chance to take stance


Posted: Sun, 17 Jul 2011 00:27:58 MDT
When Pat Bowlen's right-hand man dropped in on Brian Xanders at his Dove Valley office one day last December, the Broncos were in disarray.



Krieger: Could be sunshine behind clouds for Rockies


Posted: Wed, 13 Jul 2011 23:31:22 MDT
So even after Jim Tracy explicitly warned the Rockies that they can't count on a late charge every year to make the playoffs, they're going to need a late charge to make the playoffs.



Krieger: Gifted female athletes take world by storm


Posted: Tue, 12 Jul 2011 00:05:31 MDT
Let the men bicker about money. Female athletes on two continents offered a more uplifting vision of sport over an extended weekend of inspired competition.

Krieger: Ex-fans will matter down the road


Posted: Thu, 30 Jun 2011 00:01:57 MDT
With yet another American sport about to shut down in a dispute about how to divvy up its riches between uber-wealthy owners and hyper-wealthy players, the official unemployment rate hovers just below 10 percent.



Krieger: Rockies still treading water


Posted: Wed, 29 Jun 2011 00:25:06 MDT
Like most teams, the Rockies started out with eight players on the National League all-star ballot. Unlike most teams, only five are still with the club.

Krieger: Jimenez happy to end sad streaks


Posted: Sat, 18 Jun 2011 23:49:58 MDT
This is the wonder of baseball. When the game finally put a smile on the face of Ubaldo Jimenez in his home park, it was because of his bat, not his arm.



Krieger: Rockies' supporting cast reason for subpar record


Posted: Thu, 16 Jun 2011 00:00:39 MDT
Jhoulys Chacin is the new Ubaldo Jimenez. Charlie Blackmon is the new Dexter Fowler. Chris Nelson is the new Ian Stewart. And so it goes for the Rockies. For every newcomer stepping up, there's a former newcomer stepping back.

Krieger: Time for Rockies to replace Ty Wigginton at third base


Posted: Mon, 13 Jun 2011 15:36:02 MDT
It's not often a grand slam counts as four unearned runs, but when it does, it's usually a killer. It was for the Rockies on Sunday.



Krieger: Carlos Gonzalez unafraid to play small


Posted: Sat, 11 Jun 2011 01:05:59 MDT
Eighteen games from the halfway mark of the baseball season, how many bunt hits do you suppose it takes to lead the National League?



Krieger: Rockies' lineup a work in progress


Posted: Wed, 8 Jun 2011 00:22:27 MDT
It's not often that you throw a shutout and get demoted, but that's what Clayton Mortensen is looking at today as the Rockies continue rearranging the furniture in hopes of righting the ship.
MEDIA ENCLOSURE: http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2010/0525/20100525__Jtracy052510~p1.jpg




Krieger: For Nuggets GM Ujiri it's hurry up and wait


Posted: Sat, 4 Jun 2011 23:49:01 MDT
Masai Ujiri took the short walk from his home in the Golden Triangle to a nearby coffee house one recent morning like a man all dressed up with no place to go.



Krieger: Pulling a win out of a hat


Posted: Thu, 2 Jun 2011 23:32:51 MDT
Billy Martin's Detroit Tigers had lost four in a row and 10 of 13 heading into a Sunday doubleheader against the Indians on Aug. 13, 1972.

Krieger: Rockies' Ubaldo Jimenez a victim of velocity


Posted: Mon, 30 May 2011 22:48:05 MDT
It has devolved from a minor injury to a disappointing start to a gathering mystery. Two months into the baseball season, the ace of the Rockies' pitching staff has yet to win a game.



Krieger: Rockies' offense: It's alive ... alive!


Posted: Sun, 29 May 2011 02:04:55 MDT
Just when you thought zombies had taken over the Rockies' uniforms in an oddly purple remake  of "Night of the Living Dead," they break out for a season-high 15 runs and 18 hits, bringing back memories of the team that came north from spring training two months ago.



Krieger: Rox GM in no rush to make a move


Posted: Thu, 26 May 2011 00:15:11 MDT
Think of the Rockies as a gunfighter down to one bullet. They can make a move to add salary to their $80 million payroll if they have to, but probably only one.



Krieger: Don't swing, Ubaldo!


Posted: Sun, 22 May 2011 23:26:30 MDT
So here's the situation: The Rockies load the bases with one out in the fourth Sunday against Randy Wolf, the Brewers' crafty left-hander.

Krieger: Feds take chance on pursuing Lance


Posted: Sat, 21 May 2011 23:48:41 MDT
Remember the age of innocence, when we were shocked and appalled that an athlete might be using performance-enhancing drugs and lying about it?



Krieger: Two teams play political football


Posted: Thu, 19 May 2011 00:36:38 MDT
Many years ago, before I covered sports, I covered politics and government. When people ask why I switched, I usually tell them that politics and sports are the same.



Krieger: Jim Tracy keeps optimistic tone for Rockies


Posted: Mon, 16 May 2011 23:49:17 MDT
About three hours before the reeling Rockies were to play the Giants on Monday night, manager Jim Tracy closed his clubhouse and gathered his players for a team meeting.

Krieger: Broncos' Allen plays waiting game


Posted: Sun, 15 May 2011 00:28:03 MDT
Dennis Allen has a dream job. The son of a pro football player, he grew up to be a standout college player and then a coach. Now, at age 38, he's a first-time NFL defensive coordinator.



Krieger: Rockies' Lansford won't back down


Posted: Wed, 11 May 2011 23:13:04 MDT
Just in case you blinked, Carney Lansford's honeymoon as the Rockies' new hitting   coach is over. Welcome to Don Baylor's world.

Krieger: Time almost up for Rockies' Ian Stewart


Posted: Tue, 10 May 2011 07:36:15 MDT
If Ian Stewart's time in Colorado is running out, it's only because Ian Stewart has no idea what to do about it.

Krieger: Mike Ditka says power, not money, at root of NFL tiff


Posted: Sat, 7 May 2011 11:04:11 MDT
Confused about a $9.5 billion business closing its doors in a dispute over how to split up the goodies?



Krieger: Rockies' Jimenez, CarGo struggle to live up to stardom


Posted: Wed, 4 May 2011 07:40:18 MDT
The most astonishing thing about the Rockies' sprint to the top of the National League West standings is they've done it with little or no help from two of their three young stars.
MEDIA ENCLOSURE: http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2011/0503/20110503__Rox050311cargo~p1.jpg




Krieger: Lot to do to undo McD's doings


Posted: Sun, 1 May 2011 01:27:42 MDT
When Josh McDaniels arrived at Dove Valley in January 2009, his main priority was to undo much of his predecessor's handiwork. In a matter of minutes, or so it seemed, the core of Mike Shanahan's offense was on its way out the door and had to be replaced.



Krieger: Broncos defense a doughnut


Posted: Sat, 30 Apr 2011 01:00:53 MDT
In a startling development, the Broncos announced late Friday night that they will switch to a spread defense next season.



Krieger: Best player wins, and that's OKC Thunder's Kevin Durant


Posted: Fri, 29 Apr 2011 13:16:03 MDT
For a team that was all about playing the right way, it's an unhappy truth: This time of year in the NBA, the best player on the court usually wins.

Krieger: True grit gets Nuggets new opportunity


Posted: Tue, 26 Apr 2011 10:10:27 MDT
The Nuggets avoided being swept out of the playoffs with a combination of grit, desperation and heart-stopping 3-point shooting Monday night.

Krieger: Odds are against Broncos going 4-for-4 in NFL draft


Posted: Mon, 25 Apr 2011 13:51:03 MDT
Optimism, naivete and, let's be honest, pure fantasy are always in unlimited supply around the NFL draft.
MEDIA ENCLOSURE: http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2011/0421/20110421_084103_Ppeterson042111a.jpg




Krieger: Melo trade taking a toll


Posted: Sun, 24 Apr 2011 01:53:29 MDT
The Nuggets' postseason hopes ran into a brick wall Saturday night, and they built it themselves, brick by brick.

Iridium launches Wi-Fi hotspot for extreme roamingBy PETER SVENSSON - AP Technology Writer | AP – 13 hrs ago

NEW YORK (AP) — Want to get email on your iPhone or BlackBerry in the middle of the ocean, or in the Arctic? Now you can — but it'll cost you.Satellite phone company Iridium Communications Inc. said Wednesday that it is launching a cigarette-pack-sized box that connects to an Iridium phone.The box produces a Wi-Fi hotspot that smartphones and tablet computers can connect to. The phone relays that connection to satellites overhead, which then shunt the signal to a ground station connected to the Internet.The data speeds will be slower than dial-up, but they should be good enough for meaningful use of email, Iridium CEO Matt Desch said.Iridium, which is based in McLean, Va., said the AxcessPoint will cost less than $200, but it needs to be paired with a phone that costs about $1,000. The data connection will cost about $1 per minute.Iridium phones can already connect laptops to the Internet, through the use of a cable.AT&T Inc. sells an alternative solution for those who need Internet access where there are zero bars of regular coverage: a "Genus" smartphone that connects directly to a satellite. However, that satellite covers only North America, while the Iridium network of 66 satellites spans the entire world.

Looking at the posts, it is very obvious how many people have never left their hometowns and cities and are clueless about the state of communications in the rest of the world.

My HTC already shares internet with a lap top, Iridium is way to expensive and primitive. In addition , roaming internet world wide or buying a monthly GSM chip in a foreign nation will be100 times cheaper...plus a could mention That "clearer" provider already is offering wireless internet way cheaper then these Iridium primitive technology. $200 access is crazy, "Clear " or "Simple"  internet services is unlimited for less then $75 ...shop around. America.

Well Rob, a lot of people leave their Momma's basement and go to "work", out in a place called "The World". Many parts of this "World" aren't connected to your Mom's cable TV, and so require communication in another fashion.

Excellent, now I'll be able to download porn next time I'm stranded in the middle of the Arctic.

Wikipedia states that the  Iridium satellite constellation uses (on each satellite) 7 200MHz PowerPC processors.

No wonder the data-transfer speeds are less than dialup, given that each satellite has to maintain moving radio contact with 4 others at any given time, handing off to others as they go out of sight every so often.

200MHz ... imagine that. Even the clustering of 7 CPUs seems woefully inadequate in this day and age's capabilities and needs.

Is this really a break though? I think they have had satellite phones for years. I'm pretty sure you could hook any laptop up to one of those phones and have internet. The fact that they added a wifi router really isn't much of a breakthrough!

You gotta pay $1200 just to get set up, then pay $1 a minute.  That could run an easy $720 if you're on all day.  And you will be on all day because its slower than dial up.  This will be a complete flop.  I wouldn't even use this if I was a castaway.

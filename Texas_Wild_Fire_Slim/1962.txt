College Students Missing Out on Fruits, Veggies: SurveyHealthDay – Thu, Aug 25, 2011






WEDNESDAY, Aug. 24 (HealthDay News) -- American college students 
aren't eating anywhere near the recommended five daily servings of fruits 
and vegetables, a new study finds.
In fact, they aren't even eating one serving per day, according to an 
Oregon State University survey of 582 college students. 
Males ate about five servings of fruit and vegetables per week while 
females consumed only four servings per week. Males had more fat in their 
diet than college women, but females had lower fiber intake.
Overall, females had better eating habits than males, including reading 
food labels, skipping fewer meals, and eating in college dining halls more 
frequently, the results showed.
"We found that students skipped meals fairly frequently, which could 
account for some of the lack of fruits and veggies," Brad Cardinal, a 
professor of exercise and sport science at Oregon State University, said 
in a university news release.
"Still, even accounting for fewer meals consumed, the students were on 
average not always eating even one serving of fruits or vegetables per 
day, far below USDA [U.S. Department of Agriculture] guidelines," he 
added.
The study was released online in advance of publication in an upcoming 
print issue of the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior.
"We are not teaching youth how to be self-sustaining," Cardinal said. 
"Home economics and nutrition classes have all but disappeared from our 
schools in the K-12 system. There is a fundamental lack of understanding 
on how to eat well in a very broad sense."

well that is no surprise. go down to my university's "cafeteria" its nothing but pizza, chicken, cheese sticks, burgers, fries. the most healthiest thing served is sushi. colleges want to make money off of students who need food in a hurry. so of course you'd be hard pressed to find healthy food.

Before incurring additional expenses on food, note that student loan debt cannot be discharged in bankruptcy; they remain a burden for life.

As a college student myself, first of all this is obvious, it wasn't until I moved off campus and stopped eating the carb full foods that they serve in the refectory that I was able to eat healthier and lose weight again. If they want people to eat healthier they need to serve more foods than pasta, pizza, meat and fries in the dining halls all the time

College students eat out a lot.  Fast food places or restaurants don't have nutritious meals.  If they do cook their own food, then it's usually something fattening.  Schools always tell their students to eat healthy, but if you look everywhere on campus, then you will see junk food.  If you're going to promote something, then you should be a role model.  Cafeterias and vending machines are filled with sugary snacks and high calorie meals.  

The average college student gains 10 pounds their freshman year!  This has got to stop.

College students not eating right....this is BRAND NEW information!  The next thing you know someone will post a report that college students aren't getting 8 hours of sleep a night, or maybe...GASP...they engage in underage drinking. Where do these freaking ass clowns come up with these topic and more importantly who pays for them???

Psalm 24

   1The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. 

   2For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. 

   3Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place? 

   4He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. 

   5He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 

   6This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah. 

   7Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. 

   8Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle. 

   9Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. 

   10Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah

It is not the government's place to teach people how to eat.  Teach the academics needed in school and butt out.  Especially in college - they are now adults.

Force them! The big corporate farms are starving! Force them to bankrupt themselves and spend all their texbook money on healthy food! Force them to eat right whether they can afford it or not! Or better yet, tax everyone else so they can eat the way these bozos say they should! Do you know who funds USDA? FARMS. Usually big corporate ones. We eat easily FIVE TIMES as much food as we need. And yes, I'm living proof, I admit it.

Maybe they should drink more fruity drinks and use v8 as a mixer more often.  College is learning to be an adult for most.  It doesn't take too long to realize there are costs associated with their current diet.

I remember in college what I wanted was not Asparagus, but MEAT. Unfortunately you cannot afford it, so you eat a vending machine snack, or cup of noodles like they say.

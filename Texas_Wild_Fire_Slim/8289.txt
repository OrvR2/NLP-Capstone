Honduran coup officials may get US visas backAP – Wed, Sep 7, 2011





TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) — The U.S. State Department is offering visas again to Honduran officials who had them revoked after taking part in a June 2009 coup that deposed former President Manuel Zelaya, a U.S. Embassy official confirmed Tuesday."The Department of State has determined that some of the Hondurans whose eligibility for visas was restricted following the June 2009 coup d'etat are again eligible to be considered for visas," said a U.S. Embassy spokesperson who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to discuss the new policy.Gabriela Nunez, finance minister under the post-coup, interim President Roberto Micheletti, said she received notice in June that she could reapply for a visa.Nunez said Tuesday she didn't know if other Honduran officials were eligible, but others said some were already traveling to the U.S.The U.S. revoked more than 1,000 visas of Micheletti officials after the coup. President Porfirio Lobo has since been democratically elected, and Zelaya has returned to the country.

AP and Yahoo still insist there was a coup, after all this time? Zelaya attempted to violate the Honduran constitution to extend his stay in office (like his hero, Chavez), and the other branches of government removed him from office in accordance with their laws. There was NO coup. There was an attempt by left-wing "journalists" and obamaistas to prop Zelaya up. You lost, get over it.

All this is a charade .Lobo , Goriletti and his cronies ,pawns of US Imperialism, are chasing , torturing and hunting down the leaders of the Honduran Resistance.In spite of all their crimes they will fail, the Resistance has the unstoppable will of the Honduran People,and the mentor of these filthy lackeys ( USA ) is in irreversible agony.
Always onward to victory, Honduran Resistance! It will be easy, US Imperialism will keep plummeting, USA is facing the "perfect economic storm".
Viva! Viva! Viva!

nobody realizes that Zelaya, the ex-president, was corrupt and a puppet of the USA.  He wanted to change the Honduran constitution and was loaded with cash in Honduran accounts" a poor farmer".  It would have been better to shot him than send him to another country.  I was in Honduras and the US media is biased.  We only get half truths in the US.  If you don't believe me, travel outside the US.

Guillermo you are correct, but you know Mr. Obama's policies and the US media, they just love the Left. There was no coop. Zelaya wanted to be like our amigo Sr. Hugo, and if everything goes well he wont be with us much longer.

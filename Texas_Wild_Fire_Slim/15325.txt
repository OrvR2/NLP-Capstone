249.11 ACL Festival Birthday Party
Family Friendly, Free things to do in Austin, Live Music, Outside, Things To Do In Austin | 8 Sep 2011

It’s the 10th anniversary of Austin City Limits!

The festival has certainly come a long way in 10 years. As with any big landmark, it seems only natural to have a celebration and they’re doing just that tonight at Republic Square Park. Come out and join them as they celebrate in typical ACL fashion with music, movies and food.
The Alamo Drafthouse Rolling Roadshow will be set up to display some of the best videos from the past 10 years of the festival. They will be giving away fun ACL freebies and tickets to the ACL festival aftershow!
They also will be raffling off two 3-day passes to support wildfire relief efforts. Raffle tickets are $10 or 3 for $20. Cash Only.

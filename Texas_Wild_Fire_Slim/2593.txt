In Al Gore's most recent post to "Al's Journal," the former vice president slams President Obama for his recent retreat on smog standards.
Last Friday, under pressure from big industries and GOP lawmakers, Obama asked the EPA to withdraw proposed clean air regulations.
According to the Associated Press, "The regulation would have reduced concentrations of ground-level ozone, the main ingredient in smog, a powerful lung irritant that can cause asthma and other lung ailments."
Janice Nolen, assistant vice president of the American Lung Association, told The Huffington Post that she was "outraged," given that "the current standard used was based on the science as of 14 years ago -- before we knew that ozone killed people."
In Gore's Wednesday post, he writes: 
Instead of relying on science, President Obama appears to have bowed to pressure from polluters who did not want to bear the cost of implementing new restrictions on their harmful pollution—even though economists have shown that the US economy would benefit from the job creating investments associated with implementing the new technology. The result of the White House’s action will be increased medical bills for seniors with lung disease, more children developing asthma, and the continued degradation of our air quality.
Gore also mentions that fact that on the very day that Obama made this announcement, activists were outside the White House engaged in protests against the Keystone XL pipeline, which is expected to run from the Canadian tar sands in Alberta to refineries on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Over the course of two weeks, over 1,200 people were arrested for their acts of non-violent civil disobedience. In a recent HuffPost piece, Gore wrote, "The tar sands are the dirtiest source of fuel on the planet."
Many others have spoken out against Obama's decision, including Robert Redford, who wrote for The Huffington Post that "President Obama has done a lot to protect public health and our environment," but "I want our smog levels to come down so more of our children and seniors can breathe clean air. Putting corporate profits above public health is unconscionable. It's outrageous that it would be countenanced -- by this president or any other."
Keith Olbermann slammed President Obama on his Friday show, asking, "What the hell is going on in the White House?"

				Check out Gore's carbon footprint, he's talking out of both sides of his mouth.  "W" uses green energy in Crawford, Texas, including a propane powered pick-up.  I know this for a fact, as I've seen his ranch foreman driving it.  Implementi­ng further EPA regulation­s at this moment will further depress the economy, not what will get the jobs program into gear.  Like it or not, it will be private companies that will hire us working folks and help the economy.  Government is a parasite, it takes from all of us that work and gives it to either slackers on welfare or government workers that produce nothing by paper flow and regulation­s on regular people.  How about giving us a break?  Please don't get the wrong idea, the only corporate checks I sign are on the back, not the front.  I work for wages and don't want the government to cause me to loose my job.  They need to back off and let the economy recover.  Remember the two scariest comments in the world, "I'm from the government and I'm here to help"!

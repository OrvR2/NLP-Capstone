CAN MY TREES GET OAK WILT FROM THE SMOKE OF BURNING DISEASED WOOD?

No, the fungus that causes oak wilt is very heat sensitive. The problem with firewood is the potential for storing contaminated wood. If the wood came from an oak wilt center and has fungal mats, then the beetles can fly off and infect the healthy trees in your yard.

The best precaution is to always buy well seasoned firewood. Once the wood has dried out to the point where the bark is falling off and the wood is cracked then the fungus that causes oak wilt is no longer viable (alive).

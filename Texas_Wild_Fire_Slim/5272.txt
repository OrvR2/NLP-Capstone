NBC News hires star Middle East correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin away from Al Jazeera EnglishBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – Mon, Aug 22, 2011

Mohyeldin (AJE)
Ayman Mohyeldin, a correspondent for Al Jazeera English--and, arguably, the network's biggest star--is joining NBC News as a foreign affairs correspondent, NBC announced on Monday.
Mohyeldin, who was the face of Al Jazeera during the so-called Arab Spring, began his career at NBC in 2001 as a desk assistant. He has also held Middle East posts at Fox News and CNN.
"After five years, it's time to say farewell and thank you to #AJE," Mohyeldhin wrote on Twitter. "Back to where it all began ... I have joined NBC News."
"We're excited to welcome Ayman back to the NBC News family as a foreign correspondent," NBC News president Steve Capus said in a statement. "An extremely passionate and hard working journalist and producer, Ayman has a great deal of experience in various newsrooms covering major conflicts, and we think he will be an excellent addition to our team of correspondents." Mohyeldin, who is based in Egypt, will start in September.
As TVNewser notes, the hiring is a coup for NBC News, and a blow for Al Jazeera English, which showcased Mohyeldin earlier this year during an American press tour.
Mohyeldin was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 "Most Influential People in the World" in 2011.

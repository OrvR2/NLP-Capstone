KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — A powerful Taliban truck bomb that wounded 77 American soldiers and killed five Afghans outside a combat outpost served as a reminder on Sunday that 10 years after the Sept. 11 attacks, nearly 100,000 U.S. troops are still fighting a war that shows no signs of slowing down.No U.S. troops were killed when the massive bomb loaded on a truck filled with firewood exploded Saturday night just outside the gates of Combat Outpost Sayed Abad in eastern Wardak province. NATO said a protective barrier at the entrance absorbed most of the force of the blast, although the area outside the base was hit hard.Officials said the Afghans killed included a policeman and four civilians, including a 3-year-old girl. Another 17 Afghans — 14 civilians and three policemen — were wounded. The provincial governor said the blast was so powerful it damaged about 100 shops in the nearby Sayed Abad bazaar.Although Saturday's truck bombing occurred outside the base, the numbers of injuries it caused was significant. Combat outposts usually house about 200 troops.The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier, they had issued a statement vowing to fight until all foreign troops leave. The radical Islamic movement, which gave shelter to Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida when it ruled Afghanistan, also stressed that it had no role in the Sept. 11 attacks, and it accused the U.S. of using them as a pretext to invade the country."The Afghans have an endless stamina for a long war," the statement said. "Through a countrywide uprising, the Afghans will send the Americans to the dustbin of history like they sent other empires of the past."The attack occurred just over 40 miles (70 kilometers), or about an hour's drive, from Kabul in an increasingly lawless district in a key province that controls a strategic approach to the capital.Sayed Abad is seven miles (12 kilometers) east of the Tangi Valley, where the Taliban on Aug. 6 shot down a U.S. military helicopter, killing 30 Americans. Many of the dead belonged to the U.S. Navy's SEAL Team 6 — the same elite unit that killed bin Laden during a May 2 cross-border raid into Pakistan, where al-Qaida's leadership was driven. It was the deadliest single loss for American forces in the decade-old war."Some back home have asked why we are still here," U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker said at a 9/11 memorial at the embassy in Kabul. "It's been a long fight and people are tired. The reason is simple. Al-Qaida is not here in Afghanistan, and that is because we are. ""We're here so that there is never again another 9/11 coming from Afghan soil. We, with our Afghan partners, figured out that the best way to ensure that is to work together and with the international community for a stable, secure, democratic Afghanistan."The Taliban continue to launch regular attacks and orchestrate assassination campaigns against those allied with the government. In addition to the attack in Wardak on Saturday, 10 Afghan civilians were killed in two separate roadside bombings.Two Afghan security guards were also killed late Saturday when an insurgent rocket slammed into a part of the sprawling U.S. base at Bagram air field outside Kabul, the U.S. military said. Two NATO service members and two Afghans were slightly wounded.NATO also said Sunday that one of its service members was killed in an insurgent attack a day earlier in eastern Afghanistan. That brought the death toll to 13 this month — and 417 this year — for coalition forces. At least 307 of the dead were Americans, and despite U.S. reports of progress on the battlefield the number of troops dying this year is at about the same level as 2010.While the overall international death toll dropped by 14 percent in the first half of the year, the number of Americans who died remained virtually unchanged, 197 this year compared with 195 in the first six months of last year, according to a tally by The Associated Press.In a midyear report last July, the U.N. said 1,462 Afghan civilians also lost their lives in the first six months of this year in the crossfire of the battle between Taliban insurgents and Afghan, U.S. and NATO forces. During the first half of last year, 1,271 Afghan civilians were killed.The United States and its allies invaded Afghanistan on Oct. 7, 2001, after the Taliban, who then ruled the country, refused to hand over Osama bin Laden.The late al-Qaida leader was at the time living in Afghanistan, where the terror network had training camps from which it planned attacks against the U.S. and other countries.Although the Taliban were swiftly driven from power by the U.S.-led coalition, they managed to use the years of the Iraq war — when America focused its military strength on the conflict against Saddam Hussein — to regroup, rearm and reorganize.They began winning back ground lost to the international military coalition until President Barack Obama decided to send in 30,000 more troops last year to help.The U.S. has begun withdrawing some of its 100,000 troops from Afghanistan and will send home 33,000 by the end of next year. The international military coalition has already begun transferring security responsibilities to newly trained Afghan forces with the aim of removing all their soldiers by the end of 2014."We are and will remain committed to Afghanistan and the region," Crocker said. "We are in this for the long haul. We are transitioning security responsibility to Afghan forces, but transition does not mean disengagement."Commemoration ceremonies were held at many U.S. and NATO military bases around the country.Although the coalition has made some gains in the Taliban's traditional southern strongholds, violence has not abated around the country.The battle against al-Qaida also has spread across the border with Pakistan, where a suspected U.S. missile strike on a house Sunday killed three people in an al-Qaida and Taliban safe haven along the frontier, Pakistani intelligence officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk with reporters.The United States has fired scores of missiles into northwest Pakistan since 2008, trying to keep al-Qaida operatives there on the run.___Associated Press writers Heidi Vogt in Kabul and Rasool Dawar in Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan, contributed to this report.

Dear Mr President,

It's time to bring our troops home, NOW.   If you know your world history, you'll know that there has never been peace in the middle east.  Let me repeat that for you.. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  Just what makes you think that you can change that. All you have been able to do while in office is to show the American people that you turned out to be the wrong man for the job of running our great country. You of course inherited many problems that the idiot before you created but the damage you have done and continue to do will take some exceptionally brilliant people after you leave to correct. You do realize what the chances of that happening is, don't you ? Are you that stupid and self centered that you cannot see just what you are doing ?  Perhaps if your children we're not going to inherit the money you will be leaving and they had to forge their way through life like the majority of the American people, you would be making different decisions to insure the future they have to look forward to wouldn't be as bleak as it is going to be.  The legacy you are leaving for them and their children and their children's future will be for them to be reminded, daily perhaps, that their father might have been the first black president, but he is the one that sent this country in the wrong direction and just fu'ked it up.   Mr President, don't you think it's about time you did something positive for this country and stop doing things to boost your own ego ?  

I am proud to be an American and always will be, in spite of what you have done to tarnish America's name around the world.  I fought for this country in Viet Nam, not because I believed in the war because I didn't, but because it was the right thing for me to do as an American.  I defended this great country but not sure from what. If north Viet Nam took over the south, just what danger did the American people face.  What have you done Mr President to defend this country.  I'm sure that you had high hopes for doing good things for the great land, you sure talked a good game to get elected and sure have fallen flat on your face ever since.  You have followed in the footsteps of probably just about every politician before you, that is, you made promises to the American people to get into office and you didn't do what you promised. You lied.  Are you proud of that ?  I'm also pretty sure that all the black people that were so excited  about you being the first black president are now sitting back and thinking, "boy, did we fu'ck up."   I'm pretty confident in saying that most of the white's that voted for you are thinking the same.

What we can only hope for at this point is that you don't do any more damage until your turn while sitting in the oval office runs out. I am happy to know that you will be a one term president. I am sure you had hopes of going for another term, but in all reality, I don't think that will happen. That's called a pipe dream Mr President.  Perhaps the best thing for you to do immediately after returning to civilian life would be to sit down, smoke a pipe full and realize just what you have done.  Nothing to be proud of, that's for sure.

Signed,

A Proud American

You know, based on a comment below, it made me think of something: we didn't invade Japan proper, we just went from the air, took out two major cities and the war ended. I don't know why we didn't stick to that plan. Take out a few militant regions and see what happens. Get out men and women off the ground, and take advantage of all that billion dollar technology that rarely gets used because we want a "humanitarian" war. Tell that to Daniel Pearl.

Why should this be a reminder? Oh, thats right. since Obama entered office we barely see battle reporst and body bags.  Before the elcection it was wall to wall coverage on every news cast. Now, the media does not want to show the wars Obama promised to end and in fact expanded.

This is a war that can not be won by any Army These people have been fighting since the beginning of time. We must pull out and let these Afghan's defend their own country. It is a fruitless war that we are fighting. The Taliban are fighting for what they believe in and it is not our place to tell them how they must live or worship. The Afghan people need to stand up and fight for themselves. And if they want our help then they need to pay for everything no more American dollars should be spent. These terrorist really only want America and it's allies out. Let's give them what they want But we need to make it very clear that if they ever attack us or any of our allies we will come back and destroy them once and for all. They will not have a county that will be worth livng in for we will make it a waste land not fit for man to live in.
This may sound wrong and cruel to some who read this. But we must be very firm and commit to that promise if America ever wants to maintain it's postion in the world and have peace.

What kind of sick monster deliberately attacks the lives of innocent children and people?? Are they trying to prove that they are strong and brave and not afraid? Why not use your words instead of weapons and talk to people about what you disagree on. These people have no value for life, or human decency or morals. I never want to raise a child in this world.

If anyone wants to know the who pays the price of war & conflict take a look at the combat veterans. Many times, politicians want to beat the drums of war, yet are not willing to pick up a rifle & fight. In return many veterans endure long waits to receive benefits, if they receive any at all. The Dept. of Veteran Affairs has over an 800,000 case backlog of veteran claims. You always see politicians surround themselves with troops but you never see politicians surround themselves with disabled veterans. The only time veterans are even reconized is on veterans day & even that holiday has the veterans less noticed today than in the past. An individual is worth millions of dollars while he or she is fighting in a war or conflict, yet when these individuals leave the military, they are not worth 10 cent, according to our government. All the veterans want is what our government promised if we became injured or hurt.

All rag heads are the same.  They are ALL taught in the Quran and by their parents, to hate all Americans.  And we are stupid enough to continue to let them move here and slowly try to change our culture to fit theirs.  Wake up America, these people need to be sent home.

Billionaire RJ Kirk Rebuts Warren Buffett's Tax ArgumentBy Brian Solomon | Forbes – 17 hrs ago




Related ContentBillionaire RJ Kirk Rebuts Warren Buffett's Tax Argument


In the most recent issue of FORBES, we talked to billionaires about Warren Buffett's desire to pay higher taxes. Pharmaceutical entrepreneur RJ Kirk espoused his rebuttal in longer form than we could fit in the magazine. Here it is in full:
I do not know what problem Mr. Buffett's proposal is intended to fix.  Is it the federal deficit?  If the effective tax rate on the highest income people was raised to 100% it would not, according to the data that is presented in the op-ed piece, put a meaningful dent in the enormous federal budget deficit nor even in the astronomical rate of its currently projected growth -- even assuming that all such people would work just as hard as they do now while doing so for free.  Clearly, the government's budget morass will not be remedied to any significant degree at all by tax increases on the wealthy.
Is it a moral issue?  This would appear to be unlikely since, as I understand the essential requirements of any advocated moral position to be regarded seriously as such, it should have to be advanced only by those who already are in conformity with the moral position.  I am sure that the US Treasury would be happy to receive any additional sum that any person would care to send it.
Is it simply intended to provide more publicity for the most famous conglomerateur in history?  If so, it seems a tad bizarre that anyone would care what Mr. Buffett's views on personal income taxation are.  Since his net worth is more than 7,000 times his personal taxable income, for him to say that he should be paying more tax has the same relative value as the average American saying that he wishes that he had left a couple bucks more tip on today's lunch tab.  Few of them, however, would take to the pulpit to explain why everyone else should tip more as well.
Perhaps the piece is intended to provide advice to the government in perilous economic times, in which unemployment is doubtless the greatest challenge.  If you want to know if raising taxes will have an impact on job creation, however, you shouldn't ask a conglomorateur.  Actually, it is axiomatic that high tax regimes favor conglomeration (which is why we haven't seen many new ones recently).  Since the SBA tells us that most new jobs in this country are provided by small businesses and since small business owners actually need their income as their primary source of funding business expansion, I would ask those small business owners (whose incomes are very significant in relation to their net worth) if tax increases will affect their expansion and investment plans one way or another.  That would be an op-ed piece worth reading and considering.
Agree with Mr. Kirk? Agree with Mr. Buffett? Sound off in the comments.

I believe Mr. Kirk made his point well.  Those most impacted by increasing taxes would be those who reinvest a substantial portion of their net incomes into their businesses rather than indulging themselves with conspicuous consumption.  The most pertinent question becomes where in this
economic activity is best to apply the tax.  At the income side of this activity or at the consumption side?  It would appear that the "most constructive push" would be at the point of 
consumption in the form of a value added tax.

50% of the country does not pay and federal income taxes.

The top 5% income earners ($156,000+) pay 60% of all federal income taxes.

The top 1% income earners ($340,000+) pay 39% of all federal income taxes.

1.  We need to completely overhaul the tax code, while focusing on simplicity.

2.  Why do the top 5% need to pay more, and more, and more than their fair share?  Clearly 50% of the country doesn't care WHO pays for the federal government, and will keep voting for people that will prevent them from paying ANY taxes.  

3.  It is already a progressive tax system.  Don't need to make it a progressive LIBERAL tax system.

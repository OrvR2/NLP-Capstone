RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Striker Josh Kennedy netted twice to continue his goal-scoring streak as Australia beat Saudi Arabia 3-1 on Tuesday to continue its winning start to Asian qualifying for the 2014 World Cup.The lanky, Japan-based Kennedy, who also scored the late winner in Australia's comeback 2-1 win over Thailand last Friday, gave the Socceroos the lead with a header in the 40th minute and doubled the margin with a shot in the 56th.The Saudis scored in the 66th when Nasser al-Shamrani swooped on the rebound after goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer stopped his penalty attempt.But Luke Wilkshire restored the two-goal buffer with a 77th-minute penalty, ensuring Australia tops Group D with six points from two matches.The Australians are three points clear of Thailand, which had 3-0 win over Oman in Bangkok. The next matches are on Oct. 11.Socceroos skipper Lucas Neill told Australian television the away win was a very professional response from his team after heavy criticism in the wake of the Thailand match last week in Brisbane."I thought we were very convincing and stuck to a good game plan," Neill said. "Three goals away from home against arguably the second favorites in the group. Now we're in a strong, strong position to finish on top."The Saudis had the best chances early, with Schwarzer saving what could have been an own goal from Carl Valeri before Nawaf al-Abid fired wide in the 16th minute.Ahmed Ateef drilled a shot at Schwarzer in the 28th before the Australians settled and started to control possession.

Australia good play kick the Saudi out of the world.




 






Eric Joseph
Yesterday

The Saudis seem to be declining in standards over the last few years, most probably because their players do not play in overseas leagues like in Europe or Japan, but ply their trade in Saudi Arabia

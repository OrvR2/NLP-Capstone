Criticism mounts of SAfrican chief justice nomineeBy MICHELLE FAUL - Associated Press | AP – 17 hrs ago

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Opposition is mounting to a pastor nominated to lead South Africa's judicial system who critics say is an apologist for rapists in a country with the world's highest incidence of sexual assault.Opponents are also questioning whether Judge Mogoeng Mogoeng can put the country's constitution, one of the most liberal in the world, ahead of the Bible.And they ask what his stand is on gay rights enshrined in the constitution since he belongs to a church that believes homosexuality is a disease that can be cured.On Wednesday three women Nobel Laureates joined South African social justice groups urging President Jacob Zuma not to appoint Mogoeng as chief justice."Many of his rulings have undermined the severity of the crime of rape and its consequences for victims and invoke dangerous myths about rape that often blame the victims themselves and excuse perpetrators of egregious crimes," said Nobel Peace Prize winners Jody Williams of the United States, Shirin Ebadi of Iran and Mairead Maguire of Ireland.Mogoeng vigorously defended himself last weekend at a hearing on his nomination before the Judicial Services Commission. Critics including groups defending women's and gay rights and social justice as well as three South African bar associations, fellow judges and nine senior U.S. law professors have all sent submissions to the commission."The constitution guarantees every South African freedom of religion, belief and opinion. In the exercise of this right, I have fully embraced the Christian faith," he said at the televised hearing. "I did and do so mindful of the fact that our constitution was not meant to benefit Christians to the exclusion of all other people who either belong to other faiths or do not subscribe to any religion at all."Mogoeng said those who suggest he is "insensitive to gender-based violence" had relied on three cases involving rape against women.In the cases he was apparently referring to:__ In 2001 Mogoeng quashed a two-year jail term for a man who tethered his girlfriend to the back of his car and drove the car, dragging her for 50 meters (yards) along a dirt road. Mogoeng said the man had been "provoked" and instead fined him R4,000 ($590).__ In 2004 Mogoeng reduced the sentence of a man found guilty of raping his eight months' pregnant wife in the presence of another person, arguing the assault was "not serious" and suggesting that sex between a husband and wife could not be considered rape.__ In 2007 Mogoeng suspended the jail sentence of a man found guilty of throttling and attempting to rape his estranged wife, reasoning he had been "aroused by his wife" because she was "clad in panties and a nightdress," and that he had used "minimum force."Mogoeng said his critics deliberately ignored his rulings in at least seven other cases involving rape of women in which he imposed or confirmed "substantial periods of imprisonment" ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.South Africa's laws mandate a minimum sentence of 10 years for rape."Justice Mogoeng has demonstrated that he cannot be relied upon to champion the rights of one half of the population," Sonke (All) Gender Justice Network said Wednesday.South Africa suffers the highest rate of rape in the world, especially child and baby rape.Mogoeng, 50, has a master's degree in law from the long-distance University of South Africa and began his career as a Supreme Court prosecutor in 1986. He was made a judge of the Labor Appeal Court in 2000 and judge president of the provincial North West High Court in 2002. Two years ago he was appointed to the Constitutional Court.Mogoeng is also a pastor of the Winners Chapel International church, which offers to save souls, drive out disease and cure "deviations," including homosexuality, through prayer and counseling.Mogoeng lost his temper when commissioners at his hearing questioned his part in a case involving a ruling on homosexuality, causing one commissioner to say that his "petulance" raised questions about the suitability of his temperament for the post and another to comment that he had never interviewed "so arrogant" a nominee.During his two years in the Constitutional Court Mogoeng has made two dissenting judgments that fed speculation he is extremely conservative and perhaps homophobic. Mogoeng denied he is homophobic.Four social justice groups questioned Mogoeng's reliance on a passage from the Bible to explain to the commission why he would uphold the law.Quoting from the Book of Romans, Mogoeng said: "Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves."He told the commission he believes that God wants him to be the chief justice: "I prayed and I got a signal that it was the right thing to do ..."Zuma is studying the commission's recommendations and is expected to make an announcement soon.

South Africa has the highest incidence rate for rape on the entire earth, bar no other country.   Hmmm, how long has this been going on?  Didn't the jigs take over?  Isn't everything sooooo much better now?  Wow it must have really been bad before the monkeys took over the zoo.

Whites just need to get out of that hellhole before it's too late. The Jews are whipping up a frenzy of hate against the white South Africans just like they did here in the U.S. Whites are raped with impunity and 4,000 white farmers have been murdered by blacks. Most of the diamond and gold mines are owned by Jews in SA so whites should leave and let the Jews deal with the blacks themselves. Jewish Communists were instrumental in overthrowing the white system so let the Jews lose their mines and property to the savages. lol Poetic justice.

Religion has NOTHING to do inside politics .   A christian judge ? or a muslim judge ? Not possible. An intelligent atheist would be perfect.

He is probably as good as Ginsberg, sotamayer or the other idiot Obama appointed. We are increasingly being ruled by the judiciary.

Whoa! I thought all of the opposition was over a white guy. I saw the picture and then remembered, oh, the twenty first century ZA. Nevermind. With or without Mogoeng Mogoeng, nothing will change. The same with Zuma or any blacks. ZA is ruined forever.

This man needs to be cured cause hew looks so sick... How can they choose someone like him who "de facto" considers women culpable when they are raped??? Well he looks like the perfect choice for SA's rapist president Jacob Zuma so he surely wouldn't hesitate to appoint this disfigured creature as chief of justice....

It sounds terribly stupid to call on SA whites to leave the country as if they were the worst sufferers in that place. In fact they still are the richest and the most privileged class in that nation although it seems like they no more exercise such an influence in politics like they did in the past. As for successfully "Black-run" countries I can name you some which are doing quite good compared to the rest of the "black-ruled" world, for e.g. Barbados, The Bahamas, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, Botswana, Gabon and somehow also Namibia.

An individual such as described in the article would fit right in with the members of Congress here in the USA.      Devoid of ethics and morals.  
But if he became a member of Congress, he would have to learn how to steal massive amounts of money and run up a huge deficit, also.

Get over it.  He is only one person, it isn't like he is going to change the opinions of the other  justices on the bench.  Besides it isn't clear from the article how he nomination process works.  In the US the President can nominate, but it is up to the Senate to give the okay to hire him.

Power and intolerance by the stupid and religious superstitious. How much longer before these idiots are called out as the idiots they are?. But hell it's not any different here in the good old U.S.A., people are running for the highest office in the land and claiming religious superstition, homophobia, xenophobia and prayer to solve droughts, fix the economy or cure homosexuality as their prominent assets

Remember that he was nominated by someone who was charged for rape. (The president of South Africa.)

Anybody who is "getting signals" from god is a nutcase and certainly has no business being a judge.

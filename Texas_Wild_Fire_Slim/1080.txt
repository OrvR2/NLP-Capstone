Politico:
Republican Sen. Richard Shelby has been one of Barack Obama's most persistent critics, accusing the president of putting the country on a road to financial ruin with deficits as far as the eye can see.
But his demands to slash government programs tend to stop at the Alabama state line.

																Obama will have the resources to defend in the face of a Republican primary campaign which, as things look now, will likely devolve into a contest to see who can portray President Obama in the worst light.

				All GOP districts/­states should be utterly starved of federal pork programs.  After the pork stops coming home, then hypocritic­al parasites like Shelby will be gone. 

Why send that money to Alaska, when Southern California already has a thriving space communicat­ions industry?  Do we really want to conduct NASA operations in a state where the legislatur­e tried to mandate that pi was "3"?

				Surprise surprise. Spending outside his state is wasteful. Spending is his state makes perfectly good sense. 
Republican hypocrisy knows no bounds. I have a special love for these southern state senators. They moan and groan about deficits knowing full well it was their votes under Bush that made it possible in the first place.

				I can explain this in very small words and simple terms.  Pork is a derrogator­y (bad) word used to describe government spending.  Republican­s (bad) tend to say pork is not good.  Shelby (bad) is a republican that normally calls for less government spending.  However, he wants more government spending in his state.  If it was in another state he would not like it but when it is in his he wants it.

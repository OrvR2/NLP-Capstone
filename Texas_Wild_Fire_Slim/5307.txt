Former reporter’s explosive letter spells bad news for News Corp. in phone-hacking sagaBy Joe PompeoMedia ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Joe Pompeo | The Cutline – Tue, Aug 16, 2011

A letter released Tuesday by the British parliamentary committee that is probing allegations of past criminal behavior by journalists at News International, the British arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, suggests that executives within the company knew more about the phone-hacking at the now-defunct tabloid News of the World than they've let on, and may have organized a cover-up.
The letter, dated March 2, 2007, was written by Clive Goodman, the former royal correspondent at News of the World, who spent time in jail for his role in tapping into the voicemail of news subjects. Goodman, portraying himself as a scapegoat, wrote the letter to appeal the termination of his employment.
"The decision is perverse in that the actions leading to this criminal charge were carried out with the full knowledge and support of [redacted names of senior newsroom employees]," it states. "Payment for Glen Mulcaire's services was arranged by [redacted name of senior newsroom employee]. The decision is inconsistent because [redacted names News of the World journalists] were carrying out the same illegal procedures."
Goodman also claims the phone-hacking was "widely discussed in the daily editorial conference, until explicit reference to it was banned by the editor."
The editor of News of the World at the time was Andy Coulson, who went on to become the press secretary to Prime Minister David Cameron, and resigned earlier this year. He was arrested in July, along with the former News International chief Rebekah Brooks, in connection with the phone-hacking allegations.
Current and former top News Corp. executives have insisted that the phone-hacking at News of the World was confined to a few rogue actors, and that company bigwigs were unaware it was going on. News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch and his son, James, testified to this effect when they were called before Parliament last month. Coulson has likewise denied any wrong-doing, or knowledge thereof.
But as The Guardian's Nick Davies writes: "The claims are acutely troubling for the prime minister, David Cameron, who hired Coulson as his media adviser on the basis that he knew nothing about phone hacking. And they confront Rupert and James Murdoch with the humiliating prospect of being recalled to parliament to justify the evidence which they gave last month on the aftermath of Goodman's allegations. ... Goodman's claims also raise serious questions about Rupert Murdoch's close friend and adviser, [former News International and Dow Jones boss] Les Hinton, who was sent a copy of the letter but failed to pass it to police."
You can read the full letter at The Guardian, as well as a timeline of News Corp's denials that phone hacking was widespread.

Some people say that business needs fewer restrictions.  No doubt there are cases where government rules are restrictive.  But seeing how businesses are willing to push up to the limit of what the law allows, and sometimes beyond it, you would be a fool to think that corporations are bound by any sense of decency or morals.  Nope, they are obliged to do as much as they can get away with in order to produce profits.  Fewer rules means more corporate control of your life, not some utopia where everything is cheap and available and packed with 100% more liberty.

Rupert Murdoch ~ Our modern day Joseph Goebbels, Famous for "Big Lie" Nazi Propoganda... That is if a Lie is big enough, and repeated often enough - The people will believe it...

Problem is, that in 2011 - WE have access to the REAL information - We can see thru the Propoganda all the way to the truth...

Buh Bye Rupert...

idiots are already defending Murdoch...I dont understand that kind of mentality. It doesnt matter what side of the aisle they are on. This kind of crime should never go unpunished.

This isn't right vs. left, though some may see it that way.  This is democracy and law vs. corruption and criminal racketeering.  Murdoch's illegal empire had prime ministers (conservative or liberal) on two continents scared of him.  His newspapers corrupted Scotland Yard, the largest metropolitan police service in Britain.  He is a menace to humanity, like any other infectious disease.

I'm glad they could use phone hacking to spy on the queen's tea parties. You know, instead of uncovering corruption and injustice. Like real journalists.

Mistakes were made.  Crimes were committed.  Can't we all just get along?  Now they want to pile on?  Leave Rupert alone!  Allow the man the dignity to run his multi-million dollar empire that twists the news so that we can all be blissfully and ignorantly happy.  These monsters need to be sent to jail.

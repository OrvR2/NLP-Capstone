One of the most recent additions to the crew of performing dolphins at the Chicago area's Brookfield Zoo, 4-year-old Nea, died Monday following an apparent "freak accident" collision with another dolphin.
Though no one witnessed the incident, the Chicago Tribune reports that Nea sustained a fractured skull just before the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin was to perform during a 1 p.m. show at the zoo. Marine mammal trainers reportedly administered CPR but were unable to save her.
Nea's death has "devastated" zoo staff who worked with her, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.
"Anybody who had worked with her just instantly fell in love with her," Rita Stacey, zoo curator of marine mammals told the Sun-Times. "She was a very fun-loving, very cooperative animal. She always wanted to work with and play with the trainers."
According to NBC Chicago, the average lifespan for a dolphin ranges between 17 and 25 years. Nea first arrived at the Brookfield Zoo only last year.
Dolphin shows were canceled for the rest of the day Monday, but resumed Tuesday.

				This won't be a popular statement in this forum... but Brookfield Zoo does a great job with their marine mammal program. The Zoo opened the first inland dolphinari­um in the world and the average life expectancy of the dolphins there are longer than in the wild and most other facilities that have bottlenose dolphins. 

While captivity can never replace the wild, wild dolphins have challenges of their own. Disturbing­ly high levels of toxins, plastics, and shark bites that often go below blubber levels. The death of the dolphin is sad for sure, but the zoo's record has been very good over the years.

				I have to agree with your comment, and found it to be even, well thought out and informativ­e,  I might add, if I may, that providing access to wild animals in a zoo environmen­t may help to educate more people and invest them with a growing sense of conservati­on and planetary care.  Just my humble opinion.

				Are we to believe that the zoo doesn't have security cameras watching the dolphins 24/7.  I understand that Dolphins are Mammals, but something smells very fishy to me.

Come on Brookfield Zoo.  Show us what happened to this poor animal. Confession is good for the soul.

The mortality rate of dolphin calves in captivity is so high that it's impossible for aquariums to maintain a stable population without capture.

				As a sailor and while living in the Caribbean, dolphins accompanie­d the ship during sail and I would see them feeding in the bay outside my home.  They are marvelous gorgeous creatures that have no place being confined.  I object to zoos, circuses and all other forms of animal exploitati­on.

We can teach our children about animals and their importance in far better ways. Perhaps early education from a very early age about their place in our world.  Less Rafi, more sience!

				Dolphins should not be confined to small tanks and made to perform for humans. Not only is it unnatural for all the obvious reasons, but Dolphin's normal sleep patterns are severely disrupted by being forced to adhere to human training and performing hours.
I can never wrap my mind around the fact that their trainers profess to love these wild creatures so much. 
Of course she .... "was a very fun-loving­, very cooperativ­e animal. She always wanted to work with and play with the trainers." 

Captive marine mammals, deprived of a normal life and access to their complex family and social structure, become desperate for anything to break through the boredom and disorienta­tion of captivity. Their "love" for their trainers is the animal equivalent of Stockholm Syndrome.

				"Some of these animals were separated from their families or abandoned or ill. Do you propose that we let such animals simply die?"
The simple answer is yes. The alternativ­e is to exploit them and expect them to be grateful. To rescue an animal, rehabilita­te it, and release it into it's own environmen­t is another matter completely outside of what is happening with zoos, circuses, and similar forums. When you rehabilita­te an animal, the less human contact, the better. You do not show case an animal you are trying to rescue and release.

				I suppose then, that you are also against pets. So many people get so bent out of shape (not you in particular­) in defense of animals in zoos, whilst most of them are avid pet owners. Now ain't that the proverbial "pot calling the kettle black"... 

Dolphins are my favorite of all crestures and this incident is truely a tragedy. But let's not stand on soap boxes here people. Animals die everyday, as do dolphins, in captivity or otherwise. Let's get it together.

Besides, I don't know about the rest of you, but I'd much rather die from an accidental head injury than being "mauled by a shark" or whatever kills dolphins in the ocean theses days (oil spills and boating accidents)­. 

Remember: Always Post Friendly :)

				I don't go to the zoo anymore. It just depresses me that they are spending their whole lives in a confined space. I know sometimes zoos are a good thing for animals that would otherwise be in danger of extinction­, but  when I see a lion sleeping on a concrete rock behind plexiglass instead of on the National Geographic Channel running free I just feel bad.

				This is NOT a freak accident. When you place several dolphins in a teeny tiny pool, they can very well run into each other. If you were placed in a broom closet with 2 other people, is it not likely that you'd run into each other? How is this a freak accident?

				So if there were no witnesses, how do they know this was an accident? How stupid does the Brookfield Zoo think we are? 

This wasn't an accident. Dolphins are expert swimmers, and know how to strike and avoid strikes with precision. This was an aggression issue, and that's what happens when you keep wild animals captive. Since dolphins can't speak for themselves­, the zoo can make up any lie they want, and who is gonna say it's false? By calling it an accident, no one calls for an investigat­ion, or calls for an end to their captive dolphin show.

				Actually cetaceans (i.e. dolphins, porpoises, orcas, etc.), along with many primates, have shown a marked propensity for murder, along with homosexual acts.

Don't forget, we're animals - we're just lucky enough to have evolved thumbs and language. We're not that far removed from them.

				They think we don't know they have security cameras in the dolphin enclosure.  They are covering up the real story. I'm guessing that the dolphinari­um is one of the few attraction­s that are making money for the zoo.  They're not gonna do anything to compromise that.

The public is being told that the poor dolphin played itself to death, and they're gonna stick to that story.

				Why do you find it hard to believe? Two orcas ran into each other in Sea World in FLorida many years ago. Blood was all over the place, photos printed in Animals Voice magazine (not sure if it is still in print.) WHen you place two animals who swim at extremely high speeds in a tiny pool, they can fun into each other. Get educated.

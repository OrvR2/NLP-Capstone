ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — New Mexico, home to several of the nation's premier scientific, nuclear and military institutions, is planning to embark on a science project of unprecedented scale – a petri dish the size of a large U.S. city.
A Washington-based technology company announced plans Tuesday to build a 20-square-mile model metropolis that would be used to test everything from renewable energy innovations to intelligent traffic systems and next-generation wireless networks.
The replica city would be capable of supporting a population of 350,000, but would be the state's newest ghost town.
Pegasus Global CEO Bob Brumely says the $200 million project will be a first of its kind in the U.S. and could create a Silicon Valley of sorts in New Mexico.

																It happened again. It was coming on midnight and I found myself awake and alone with my baby boy, staring at a lumpy childlike figure that seemed to be a ghost.

				I can build one of these that's a scale model and will do the same thing. I'm asking 2 million for it.
For 8 million more I'll include the 3-D printer that makes new buildings, fixtures, etc.
Saves a lot of time verses making  full scale empty buildings.

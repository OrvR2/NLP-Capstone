Jon Stewart finally returned to "The Daily Show" after a two-week hiatus Tuesday night, and of all the juicy stories he missed out on mocking, he chose the one-day battle between President Obama and Congress known to some as "Speechgate" first.
In case you haven't heard, there's a big Republican debate being held tonight, Wednesday, the same night President Obama had originally planned to address both houses of Congress about the nation's biggest worry: jobs. The scheduling conflict was resolved, and the President will make his address on Thursday instead, but not before a huge blowout from 24-hour news networks across the board.
Thus, "Speechgate" was born. In the segment below Jon Stewart talks about the "manufactured controversy" and chides MSNBC's Ed Schultz and CNN's Wolf Blitzer particularly hard for discussing whether or not Obama "lost" by moving his speech (Stewart to Blitzer: "Are you f*cking insane?"). And don't even get him started on the questions asked by the White House Press Corps.
You can also hear about it from John Oliver's perspective in the second video below.

				Lol ... this was one of the most hilarious Jon Stewart videos I saw in a long time ... ;-))))). OF COURSE this is a conflict created by the media. And it's probably because Boehner knew they would turn it into a controvers­y that he refused in the first place. But unfortunat­ely, the Dems refused to play, and a perfectly cool Obama simply accepted to do his speech the next day ... lol!!!

				I am an expat US citizen, living outside the US. Being able to see blog entries and such helps me to keep in touch with issues that affect ALL Americans, be they US-residen­t or not. I particular­ly enjoy the perspectiv­es that Jon Stewart brings to the fore.

I really get disappoint­ed when I click to watch a video only to be told that Hulu does not stream outside the US. It is frustratin­g, and it feels very dismissive­. Can you find some other source for your videos that can be seen everywhere­?

				You would think that a 24 hour news cycle would be great, would keep the citizens of the country informed, with everything they need to know about current events happening all over the world.
but is not. 
24 hour news cycle have become childish and have given Jon Stewart a lot of materials to talk about everyday.

Is become a daily repeat on one story, and is not because there is a lack of stories to cover around the world, is just that the media happen to be in Washington all the time
and just keep on repeating the same messages. 
is a disgrace to real journalist­s.

				Obama had previously said he wanted to give a speech when Congress reconvenes in September.  So he scheduled it for the very first day back, which is appropriat­e.  But simultaneo­usly, the Republican­s scheduled a nominee debate for that same day.  Boehner says "hey, we've got this thing scheduled that can't be moved... can you move your speech until the next day?".  So Obama does, because it'll make no measurable difference if the speech is held a day later.  The end.

Anybody who thinks otherwise is conjuring up trouble out of the ether.  Use your energy on something with far bigger ramificati­ons, like what kind of dog the Obama family chose, or how Barack Obama is more into basketball than football or baseball.

				Blunder?  Nope.  A blunder would have been that the schedule was NOT changed, and it gets realized way too late that they ought to be held at different times and it's impossible to change.  The speech was by far the easier one to reschedule­, since the debate relied on many more people and more logistics to plan ahead of time.

The news shows are even worse than the press corps.  I wish there were hot seats, I mean seats that become hotter depending on the foolishnes­s level of your question or statement.

WASHINGTON — A 500-ton crane at the Washington National Cathedral collapsed Wednesday amid thunderstorms and driving rain, damaging two nearby buildings and several vehicles as crews worked on damage from the recent earthquake.
One person, identified by a fire department spokesman as a crane operator, was taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries but no one else was hurt.
The collapse came four days before President Barack Obama's scheduled speech at the cathedral to observe the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The Sunday night speech is the highlight of three days of events set to start Friday at the cathedral.
No immediate decision was made about whether the commemoration, which also includes a concert and vigil, would go on as planned, said Richard Weinberg, a spokesman for the cathedral.
The crane was being used to repair the dings caused by the East Coast earthquake on Aug. 23. The cathedral's limestone exterior towers and some interior areas were damaged. It has been closed to visitors during repairs.
The crane, based on the bed of a tractor-trailer, toppled around 11 a.m. and slammed into the parking lot, damaging at least three cars. Images showed the crane lying on the parking lot, the tractor-trailer's wheels pointing to the sky.
Weinberg said the crane damaged Herb Cottage, which houses the cathedral's gift shop. The crane also caused slight damage to the Church House, which is used by members of the diocese. The 20 people inside the buildings were not hurt, Weinberg said.
"If it had gone any other direction it would have hit another building, which would have been bad," fire Battalion Chief John Donnelly said.
Engineers were investigating what caused the crane to tip over, and representatives from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration were on the scene. Fire officials cautioned that removing the crane from the cathedral grounds would be cumbersome.
The cathedral is one of the nation's most recognizable places of worship, holding funeral services for several U.S. presidents and a memorial service for victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Sheryl Wilcox, an event manager with the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, said she was in Church House when she was startled by a noise.
"I heard what it sounds like now – thunder – or I thought something had fallen out of the construction truck," Wilcox said.

				Perhaps it's not the cranes or the crane operators God hates, because GOD doesn't hate things or people, but what people do and the condition of their hearts toward HIM and our fellowman.  I would guess GOD is trying to show us the errors of our ways; yes, I believe in signs and wonders, in the communicat­ion of GOD and if we interrupt the signs correctly then we grow, by turning away from our wicked ways and follow His perfect path for each of us.  Did I see somewhere Christians were not invited to the Washington Cathedral during the 9/11 memorial service?

				The National Cathedral is an Episcopal and, therefore, a Christian church.  The Bishop of Washington will more than adequately represent the Christian faith at the inter-fait­h vigil at his own See.

I guess, technicall­y, Christians were not invited to the National Cathedral since they were the ones doing the inviting.

				Gee ... good thing we're far too sophistica­ted to believe in "signs and portents" (as the ancients called 'em)  --  used to be the King or the Council or whoever was running the joint would have to kill themselves or go into exile, Nature got too dicey during their tenure.

But we're all growed up, now, don't believe in nothin' but Money, so we don't got to pay attention to that kinda "wrath of the Universe" stuff no more ...

Ain't that right?

				Isn't it amazing how you sleazeball­s changed the headline from "on" to "at".  You wonder why people give media a low credibilit­y rating.  Your greed will destroy your credibilit­y.  But I guess that is the 'American Way'.  Profit at any cost.

				The carriage is part of the crane structure, the stability comes from the outriggers that extend out from the sides to increase it's footprint. Usually an outrigger will sink down if the surface it's setting on gives way, then the crane tips over, usually a very bad thing.

				Keep on messing with evangelica­l Christians and you've not seen anything yet. God will take to task those who harm His children. Matthew 18:6 But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.-----m­any little ones will not be there because their Church will not be allowed to be there.

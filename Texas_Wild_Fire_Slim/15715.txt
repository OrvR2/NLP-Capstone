California Blaze Threatens 2000 Homes

LOS ANGELES (AFP) — A man-made wildfire raged near California's Yosemite National Park on Monday, threatening thousands of homes in the latest large-scale blaze to ravage the state, officials said. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CALFIRE) said 2000 homes were at risk from the fire, which has already gutted 12 homes, scorched 26130 acres (10574 hectares), and injured three people. The blaze -- which was triggered by people target shooting on Friday -- is burning in the rugged forest and scrubland of the Sierra Nevada foothills in Mariposa county, around 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Yosemite. Around 2500 firefighters have been deployed to tackle the fire, which comes after a month-long firestorm across California that scorched more than one million acres (400000 hectares) since June 20. California is frequently hit by scorching wildfires due to its dry climate, Santa Ana winds and recent housing booms which have seen housing spread rapidly into rural and densely forested areas. In October, devastating wildfires were among the worst in California history, leaving eight people dead, destroying 2000 homes, displacing 640000 people and causing one billion dollars in damage.

A wind-stoked fire apparently sparked by guardsmen practicing with a machine gun blazed across hundreds of acres Monday as crews rushed to keep it from reaching any more homes than the two authorities said had burned a day earlier. The 300-acre fire moved in on the small community of Herriman on Sunday after flaring up at Camp Williams, a sprawling National Guard site about 30 miles outside Salt Lake City, said Captain Brad Taylor. Some 1400 homes were evacuated, and fire officials said at least 100 were threatened. A shelter for evacuees without lodging was set up at a local high school. A blaze is suspected to be caused by a spark from a Utah National Guardsman's machine gun. Video Courtesy: www.youtube.com www.youtube.com www.mutrecords.com http

Reports of people trapped, heavy fire showing, exposures severely threatened are only a few obstacles Woonsocket's bravest had to overcome to bring this 2 alarm fire under control on Mowry St on June 3, 2010 around 4am. An aggressive interior search immediately went under way. Luckily everyone was out and safe as firefighters attempted to fight the fire from the interior as other companies protected the fire from spreading to nearby homes. Fire eventually took full possession of the home and due to the collapsing structure, companies were ordered out of the building. Full video available at www.providencefirevideos.com

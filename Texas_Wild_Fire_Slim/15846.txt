You know it's strange how perfectly the building collapsed by a fire alone. And never ever in history has a skyscraper collapsed due to fire. The Windsor Tower in Madrid burned for 20 hours and never collapsed. And when you hear that fire fighters and police men and citizens on that day claiming that they heard sounds like explosives going off...and building 7 collapsing too....please. It's all to suspicious. People love to believe lies so they can continue their little lives. One day we'll all wake up to find our nations hijacked.

Conspiracy theories are irrational ideas. The reports of secondary explosions in the towers is not a theory, it happened. No evidence according to the FBI link Alqeada to the attacks is not a theory, it happened. Israelis caught with explosives at the George Washington bridge right after the attacks and released later that day is not a theory, it happened. If jet fuel could take down a steel framed structure like that, Id be rich selling this idea to controlled demolition companies. I would trademark jet fuel as a controlled demolition technique and it would save companies millions.Why would companies need chemical engineers to design timed explosives to take down ordinary structures never mind steel framed buildings. All they have to do is dump a bunch of jet fuel on it lol. Is it just a coincidence that the United State is one of the countries that scored the lowest in the subject of physics? Foreknowledge of the events leading to extensive insider trading is not a conspiracy,it happened. Follow the money trial and you will find your suspects. This tragic event did not benefit anyone including muslims, but I would say those who got extremely rich on that day certainly did benefit. The trail doesn't just end there, a lot of people got rich during the wars that came after (cough cough Haluburten). I'd say there is need of further investigation, wouldn't you say? According to some polls, most people do want an investigation including truthers, debunkers, and sideliners. This tragic event is supposed to bring Americans together, not divide them by different theories based on insufficient evidence. The 911 commission was a complete disaster according to the people that organized the investigation. If this country is truly a democracy, it will provide Americans with the truth, the absolute truth by allowing an open investigation including all confiscated evidence. Conspiracy theories including the official theory are not acceptable and the truth needs to be told. Further evidence will lead to transparency and absolute justice, making America a better country by ensuring its true enemies are dealt with. Its up to the people to initiate an investigation. LIke JFK once said "Its not what your country can do for you, its what you can do for your country".

Oh, yes, I do, I do -- I DO believe that the heat from the airplane fuel, combined with the force of the impact, made the buildings collapse.

Oh, and black is white, up is down, and Clinton did NOT have sex with that woman!

Wow. No matter how many times I see that it still horrifies me. I watched a show yesterday on building of new tower. They are building it so that could never happen again. I just don't know why they would build another tower taller than the last. I just hope the terrorists don't go after this one. God Bless the victims and there families. I also seen a show on a Canadian channel showing Canadas part. Our airports were all to capacity and the people of these small towns took in families to there homes and ghave them sleeping arrangements and food. I just wonder why not one American station mentioned how much Canada did. Kudos to your kind hearts Canadians

Think outside the box for one moment, conspiracy or not. Look at all the player's involved the US government, the Muslims, the buildings owners,(I'm sure there are more) look at all the players involved. Now set aside the facts (facts are often misleading, and/or manipulated). 
Now focus on the motives,ask yourself who gained what? what has transpired since then? Itemize what the outcome has been for each of the player's involved (I would like to know myself as I am just speculating). Money and power are funny bedfellows, an unbiased bit of deduction will be required to draw an accurate conclusion, proving anything is an entirely different matter.

I don't buy this 'stupid' act for one second. Every building in the world, unless it was carved into the side of a solid mountain, has to be demolished before it falls down, to whatever extent - however far into the future.  The eventual (historical) demolition, being situated in a dense urban area, was brilliantly designed into the structure, and the people who built it followed the instructions exactly. Straight down is by far inarguably the safest demolition and these people all did a beyond-heroic construction which did the best possible fall, under the worst, most difficult to foresee, deliberately destructive conditions. Should EVER, EVER anyone have undertaken to make them fall, they fell in the safest, most mathmatical and even manner anyone ever could have imagined, for the sake of the rest of New York. Continuing this "I don't get that" act will bring deserved suspicion.  That there is no fierce focus continued on the perpetrators and that this sorrow brought on the designers and builders has been skewed to make them feel the stink of the evil they are having to endure is not only disgusting...it's offside. Between that and Julian Assange's group not being completely unplugged, I am beginning to question the moral allegiance of the "victims", or at least begin to try to separate the bad people from what I understood the USA to be.

Speculation and debate are distractions which are energy and time sponges. This article and the questions arising are a distraction. What's not debatable is that every western intelligence agency says that al-Queda and the Taliban both get most of their money from trafficking Afghan opium and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime says that the wide open Afghan opium fields produce 20 times as much opium as they did before US led forces went into the place and the Pentagon is doing nothing at all about it. What's also not debatable is that in order to engineer an ongoing war, both sides need an ongoing source of funds. So, as hard as it is to believe, traitors are controlling the NATO effort in Afghanistan right now, because any 3rd. grader knows the dope could be bought up,plowed up,blown up or burned up by NATO, if its controllers would allow it; instead, they allow the dope to finance our enemies and pay for the bombs that kill our troops. Speculation is for sheep...just follow the facts that everyone agrees on if you're looking for reality. But, can YOU handle reality? Most people can not and few even want to.

Wow, I am amazed attp the number of dumbasses here that think the towers were 'brought down'.  Structural integrity of the impacted floors was weakened due to extreme heat.  When the upper floors came down, thats it.  The weight of those floors COMBINED, there is no structure designed to receive that kind of impact and survive.

Terrible event, but you idiots with the conspiacy theories are just making it worse.

"Pulling" Building 7

A PBS documentary about the 9/11/01 attack, America Rebuilds, features an interview with the leaseholder of the destroyed WTC complex, Larry Silverstein. In it, the elderly developer makes the following statement:
I remember getting a call from the, er, fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire, and I said, "We've had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it." And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse.

This statement seems to suggest that the FDNY decided to demolish the building in accordance with Silverstein's suggestion, since the phrase "pull it" in this context seems to mean to demolish the building. At least that interpretation appears to be supported by a statement by a Ground Zero worker in the same documentary:
... we're getting ready to pull the building six.

Building 6 was one of the badly damaged low-rise buildings in the WTC complex that had to be demolished as part of the cleanup operation.

An alternative interpretation of Silverstein's statement is that "pull it" refers to withdrawing firefighters from the building. However, according to FEMA's report there were no manual firefighting operations in Building 7, so there would not have been any firefighters to "pull" -- at least not from inside the building.
WTC 7 collapsed approximately 7 hours after the collapse of WTC 1. Preliminary indications were that, due to lack of water, no manual firefighting actions were taken by FDNY.

That Silverstein would admit that officials intentionally demolished Building 7 is bizarre for a number of reasons. Silverstein Properties Inc. had already won an $861 million claim for the loss of the building in a terrorist incident. FEMA's report states that the cause of the building's collapse was fires. Presumably FEMA and the insurance company would be interested in knowing if the building was instead demolished by the FDNY. Moreover, the logistics of rigging a skyscraper for demolition in the space of a few hours would be daunting to say the least, particularly given that demolition teams would have to work around fires and smoke.
An Overlooked Explanation

A third explanation is less obvious but makes sense of the non-sequiturs in the above explanations: perhaps Silverstein's statement was calculated to confuse the issue of what actually happened to Building 7. By suggesting that it was demolished by the FDNY as a safety measure, it provides an alternative to the only logical explanation -- that it was rigged for demolition before the attack. The absurdity of the FDNY implementing a plan to "pull" Building 7 on the afternoon of 9/11/01 will escape most people, who neither grasp the technical complexity of engineering the controlled demolition of a skyscraper, nor its contradiction with FEMA's account of the collapse, nor the thorough illegality of such an operation. Thus the idea that officials decided to "pull" Building 7 after the attack serves as a distraction from the inescapable logic that the building's demolition was planned in advance of the attack, and was therefore part of an inside job to destroy the entire WTC com

The Moloch Axis Demoniacs (MAD) did it to pass even stricter laws to control the people! The Bush family, Rumsfeld, Cheney kissinger (always stirring constitutional troubles in Spain and Argentina yet HE NEVER stands trial for anything HE ever did!). Just look at the economic mess the MAD have done in the US - world GDP is 70 trillion YET $650 trillion in off the book dirivatives compliments of the banks - MAKES NO SENSE!

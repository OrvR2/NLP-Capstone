AP photographer Richard Drew retraces the steps that led him to the ‘Falling Man’By Joe PompeoMedia ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Joe Pompeo | The Upshot – Tue, Aug 30, 2011

Richard Drew
As part of the Yahoo! News "9/11 Remembered"  series marking the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, I  profiled Richard Drew, the AP photographer who captured the famous  "Falling Man" shot that became the subject of 2003 Esquire piece by Tom Junod.
Earlier this summer, I accompanied Drew to the spot where he took the  "Falling Man" photo a block from Ground Zero. He retraced his steps  from that day for the first time in 10 years, telling me of his  experience: "I get so caught up in the adrenaline of doing this job. So,  looking  back on it, I think a lot about being able to go home to my  family every  night. Whether I decide to think about it daily or not,  it's always in  the back of my mind."
Here's an excerpt from the piece:
Richard Drew put down  his camera bag and looked up at the colossal  skyscraper that seemed to  be racing toward the clouds at an accelerated  clip.
"I don't like coming down here," he admitted.
"I'm really surprised  how fast this building's gone up," he  said of the rising edifice at 1  World Trade Center, peering at the  monolith from beneath the brim of a  tan baseball cap. "I just hope it isn't another target."

 
It was around 2 p.m. on  a bright Wednesday  afternoon in mid-July, and Drew, a veteran  Associated Press  photographer with wire-rimmed glasses and a neatly  cropped silver beard  that betrays his 64 years, was standing near the  northwest intersection  of Vesey and West streets in Lower Manhattan,  across from the noisy  jungle gym of cranes and steel where a global  business hub is currently  being reconstructed. Nine years and two  months earlier in this very spot  -- now an austere pedestrian plaza in  the shadow of the Goldman Sachs  building -- Drew took a picture that  became one of the most iconic  images of one of the most catastrophic  events in American history.
You can read the rest here. There are more than a dozen profiles in the series so far, including Dylan Stableford's sit-down with CNN producer Rose Marie Arce. A new profile will be rolled out each day through September 11.

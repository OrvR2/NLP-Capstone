Casey Anthony's parents speak out on murder trial with Dr. PhilBy Torrey AndersonSchoepePostsEmailBy Torrey AndersonSchoepe | The Newsroom – 11 hrs ago

In this Aug. 3, 2011, image released by CBS Television Distribution, …Casey Anthony has been hiding in an undisclosed Florida location since she was acquitted in July of murdering her daughter Caylee and was released from jail. But her parents are speaking out for the first time since the trial in a no-restrictions interview with Dr. Phil. He asks George and Cindy Anthony to explain questionable events from their perspective, like why did Cindy post a message on MySpace that Caylee was missing 12 days before she called 9-1-1, and what did they think was the strong odor coming from Casey's car?When asked directly about the smell, which prosecutors used as key evidence in their case, Cindy said she didn't know what it was from, while George answered, "Do I want to believe that Caylee was back there? I don't want to believe it, but I'm going by what investigators have told me. All I know is Caylee isn't with us anymore."Dr. Phil says he did not pay the Anthonys for the interview and instead is making a donation to Caylee's Fund, a charity being created to support grandparents' rights and missing and abused children.[View photos of Casey Anthony and the trial]Watch clips from Dr. Phil's interview below:

I don't understand something... Isn't clear that we will never hear the truth? No matter how many interviews and sit-downs with TV "doctors", "experts", "judges" etc will be scheduled... This family keeps tightly the secret of Caylee death...because they all involved at some points... They will NEVER tell the truth...

@Richard's Wife: NO...... A LAWYER LIES? GO ON.... It's called an oath mandated by the Constitution of the United States of America and the BAR Association that you defend your client to the best of your ability If you tell the truth, guess what? You lose your job and get DISBARRED. It happens tens of thousands of times a day in lesser cases. Look up attorney/client privilege. Thing is, I think both Casey and George had something to do with it, he's an ex cop after all, and who better than anyone would know how to quash that evidence, but watching the trial, there was no evidence to convict BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. That's another thing that the common people don't understand. I watched the jury instructions and they were handcuffed: no cause of death, no DNA, no murder weapon, just speculation, and if you do not know, in our court system you cannot convict based on a dumb #$%$ partying when there is no evidence that convinces a jury beyond REASONABLE DOUBT. Lawyers lie every day, but they are protected by aforementioned stipulations. Otherwise, they would lose their jobs. Not saying she's innocent, just saying that Jose Baez is no worse than prosecutors or any other attorneys who cover knowledge behind that oath they take as attorneys.

Sign of the times.  Casey is a mental case and she is a murderer.  She will answer to a Holy God.  The jury was filled with ignorant people. Another sign of the times.  Casey's mom was always an enabler.  Tragic.

what amazes me is that she didn't even get a guily verdict on child abuse and neglect. At the end of the day, she is responsible for her daughters well-being.And she failed miserably.

A little to late.  To be speaking out.  Also there are a lot of ways for them to step in if they felt that little girl was being misthreated.  That they could have done before she died.

I love my children but if they did anything wrong kill or harm someone. I will tell because have done it before my son shot someone and i call the police and they arrested him it was the right thing to do. He spent time in jail but now he on the right track agai. Sometimes we want to protect our kids but when they do something wrong they have to pay. I'm not ashame for turning him in. Maybe if some of this young men and women parent turn their children in for the crime they  done. then thing would be different. Casey parents new what their daughter done but cover it up. We need to stop over looking our children crimes.

I don't understand why people are critical of George and Cindy Anthony, they are victims too.  I don't believe for one minute they were involved  with the disappearance/murder of their little grand daughter.  It's Casey Anthony who got away with murder.  She is the villian in this story.  If you think their family is so dysfunctional...how do you think your family would fare if placed under the scrutiny of the media as much as these people.  I work with the public and one thing I've learned over the years is that every family is dysfunctional in some way or another.  I give Mr. and Mrs. Anthony credit (considering their large legal bills) for doing the interview without accepting any money and insisting the money for the interview go to charity.

For GOD so loved the world in this way:He gave his one and only son,so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. For GOD did not send his son into the world that he might judge the world,but that the world might be saved through him.(JOHN 3:16-17) Yes there is a higher power by whom we all will be judged. I believe with all my heart of GOD's love.Yes,little CAYLEE is in heaven and the LORD GOD JESUS CHRIST has her on his lap with his arms embracing her. GOD BLESS ALL. 
I am not ashamed: Romans 1:16

This is truly a disfunctional family in the american setting.  All of them, from the daughter, to the son to the mother and dad.  Someone definately knows what is going on but the fact of the matter is, no one is taking blame....they all act like they don't know anything.  All of them were caught in lies on the stand but she never did have to take the stand.  Maybe that is the beauty of our system....you don't have to and there to fore, you could realistically get away with murder....as is the case.....

If you remember the first calls and responses made...the Anthony's said the car smelled like death, that Casey did something to Caylee. Why are they lying for her? They have said in so many ways that they believe Casey killed her daughter, how in the world do you sleep at night knowing what really happened and the fact that you are trying to cover things up for a murderer? And what about those losers on the jury? WTF? Seriously, what were you people thinking? And now that you know the truth...don't you feel absolutely stupid? You get to live the rest of your life knowing that you let a killer go free. What happens the next time she has a baby and decides that she doesn't want it??? Is Baez on stand-by?

                     BASTROP, Texas - One of the most destructive wildfires in Texas history is slowing down thanks in part to calming winds, but stretched-thin firefighting crews have yet to gain any control of the blaze that is plowing across rain-starved grasslands now littered with hundreds of charred homes. Enlarge Laura Clements, left, and brother Ben, survey their fire-destroyed home, Tuesday, Sept. 6, 2011, in Bastrop, Texas. The Clements lost their home to fires Monday. More than 1,000 homes have been destroyed in at least 57 wildfires across rain-starved Texas, most of them in one devastating blaze near Austin that is still...

CHAN: Last year wildfires blazed through more than 500-thousand acres from Malibu to the Mexican border...killing seven people and forcing half a million people to evacuate their homes. Hungry goats come to the rescue. Bite by juicy bite, these goats are fighting California wildfires. That's because this food for goats - come the dry season in June- turns to brush that can fuel devastating flames. Last year wildfires blazed through more than 500-thousand acres from Malibu to the Mexican border ...killing seven people and forcing half a million people to evacuate their homes. This year, the state is adding eleven helicopters, more than a hundred new fire engines... and these guys. Sarah and Hugh Bunten are among about a dozen goat vendors who have been hired by Southern California cities and companies to eat their way through fire-prone areas. [Hugh Bunten, Goat Herder] (male,English): "How long will it take? We figure about an acre a day. So in about a month, they would cover 30 acres." The furry firefighters take several passes through an area before it's clear and safe...and they're ready to move on to greener pastures.

Heathland fires have been burning across parts of the UK for days amid unseasonably dry weather - with no respite expected until the weekend. The hottest April on record, which saw only 21% of expected rainfall in England and Wales, has hampered the efforts of firefighters and caused vast areas of parched land to go up in flames. Roads have been closed and some 170 firefighters have been called to the Swinley Forest area of Berkshire, where a number of fires have broken out. Video by Sky News. Share this video.

Wildfires in California, USA engulf properties and forests. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency for Kern County, where two wildfires caused 2300 people to be evacuated and destroyed more than 30 homes. Over 1000 firefighters are working to put out the larger blaze in Sequoia National Forest, which has destroyed 15000 acres. State fire authority CalFire announced that 1500 lightning strikes had sparked many new flames, with more than 75 blazing across the state. Thankfully, although one family lost a house in the town of Doyle, no injuries have been reported. We send our sincere thanks to the firefighters risking their lives to protect homes and the environment as we pray for the rapid extinguishing of the flames. May such intensely damaging conditions subside through our concerted efforts toward greater consideration of the ecosphere.

Firefighters And Farmers Losing Battle Against Wildfires In Portugal

Author: NTDTV


Wildfires are continuing to burn in Portugal as residents desperately try to save their land. Farmers are reduced to tackling the flames themselves as firefighters are hopelessly overstretched. Strong wildfires continue to rage in Portugal on Thursday. At least 1500 people are battling around 30 major fires in the north, where strong winds are fanning the flames. About 45000 acres of forest have been consumed since the beginning of August. In Guarda, local farmers are dousing the fires themselves. Firefighters never arrived, and the farmers need desperately to save their crops. [Farmer & Fire Victim]: "Everything burned. Absolutely everything. Yesterday it was my neighbor's farm that burned. We already finished the water from the irrigation wells and so far no firefighters have shown up. We asked for help from firefighters, police to the City Hall and nobody has come to help, as you can see." Two firefighters have died battling fires so far. Civil protection officials said a small team of firefighters had to be evacuated on Tuesday when they were surrounded by flames after a sudden switch in the direction of the wind. Firefighters and farmers alike are working hard to stop the blaze, but many fear they are fighting a losing battle.

US wildfires ravage 12 states and claim two firefighters. On Monday, June 20, firefighters Josh Burch and Brett Fulton lost their lives while battling a wildfire that unexpectedly reignited in dry conditions in Florida, while two other firemen were injured trying to rescue their colleagues. As of Wednesday, June 22 more than 200000 acres have been charred across the state since May, with an average of 31 new fires daily prompting the establishment of smoke shelters in cities like Jacksonville due to harmful fumes. Florida is among 12 total states in the nation where more than 10000 firefighters are valiantly working to contain 53 active fires that have consumed over 4.3 million acres since January 1, 2011, an amount three times higher than the past 10-year average. The affected states include Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, and Texas. In Arizona and neighboring New Mexico, over 853000 acres have been charred, with 11000 residents evacuated as the state endures what is being called one of the worst wildfires in history. In hard-hit Texas, dozens of fires fueled by severe drought have scorched more than 145000 acres and destroyed at least 63 homes with thousands of residents who have also been forced to evacuate. As when the fires in the worst-hit states of Texas and Arizona were first reported in early June, Supreme Master Ching Hai asked our Association members to check with local officials to see if help is needed and to please also <b>...</b>

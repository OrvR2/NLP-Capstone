I attended Midlothian High School, which is probably the complete antithesis of Ennis as far as football is concerned. My sophomore year, the Panthers went 0-10. I did not attend a football school, to say the least, but thanks to [...]

Growth shows potential, but we have to shop local
We’re glad to hear about the incremental growth in the city’s industrial tax base that City Manager Steve Howerton has shared in recent days. The prospect of big things to come, which he has mentioned in hushed tones to maintain the secrecy necessary for successful negotiations, is also tantalizing. The reasons for our growth in [...]

Homecoming win is key
Over the last eight years on homecoming night, it’s been a mixed bag for Lion football. In 2001 (53-0 vs. Red Oak), 2003 (69-7 vs. Red Oak), 2004 (63-3 vs. Mabank) and 2006 (42-9 vs. Midlothian), Ennis totally annihilated the competition. In 2005 (36-17 vs. Waco University) and 2008 (65-38 vs. Mesquite Horn), the opponents [...]

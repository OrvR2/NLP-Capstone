Ed Henry says people ‘freaked out’ over normal questions from Fox NewsBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – 14 hrs ago

Since jumping from CNN in June, Fox News' chief White House correspondent, Ed Henry, has been the target of a few tongue-lashings from White House press secretary Jay Carney--including one during President Obama's contentious debt reduction talks with Congress in late July.
In a Q&A with Adweek this week, Henry dismissed the notion that Fox News has a conservative bias.
"I know what people say about Fox and about what they say is a tilt to the right," Henry said. "Meanwhile, the reporters I know, like Bret Baier, are right down the middle and are tough on everybody."
Henry also scoffed at the idea that he's changed since jumping to CNN's rival. "I asked tough questions of the Obama White House when I was at CNN and nobody freaked out," he said. "I start asking tough questions at Fox and everybody freaked out."
He also denied that executives at Fox have been behind his line of questioning or feeding him talking points for White House press briefings.
"Absolutely not," Henry said. "My first day at Fox, President Obama gave a primetime address to the nation. That would have been a great chance for Roger Ailes or someone to say, 'Hey, Ed, there is going to be a lot of people watching tonight, maybe you should hit Obama on this or that.' I didn't get a phone call from anyone. I didn't get an email from anyone. But what I did get was, we want you to be front and center tonight. I was on with Bret Baier, not Sean Hannity or some of the opinion anchors we have."
He added: "Next morning ratings came out, and Fox had about 4 million viewers. CNN had about 2 million."
In July, on his third official day with Fox News, Henry pressed Carney on the president's debt reduction plan, asking if the administration planned to file a compromise proposal--the offer briefly accepted by Speaker of the House John Boehner--with the Congressional Budget Office.
"Look, I know you're creating a thing here for Fox," Carney shot back.
"That's not what I'm doing," Henry responded. "And you know better than that."
The exchange followed a similarly testy one the day before, and underscored the Obama administration's icy, often contentious relationship with Fox News.

Typical liberal mentality.  They only believe in tough questions directed at someone else.  When you treat people equal you are called biased or a racist.

In all seriousness, Mr. Henry protesteth too much.  When is a viewer supposed to know Fox News is running an "opinion anchor" or running straight news?  They don't hold up a warning sign:  "Next 4 hours will be right-wing opinion" and another sign 4 hours later: "We are now returning to middle-of-the-road."  Roger Ailes and the "opinion anchors" are all self-proclaimed far right conservatives, as is the consultants they hire such as Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich.  Ed Henry, if you don't like how you are treated, you might want to stop being paid by a conservative news organization.

Fox News is a Right Wing Joke! Can someone tell me where was Fox News when Bush was in office? If they are not as far right as they say there are, why were they not as harsh on Bush when we was in office screwing up everything? Yet they have talked badly about Obama since he took office. Fox seems to dig up everything they can, now, about what the White House is doing wrong yet did nothing (besides pats on the back) while Bush help lead us to where we are now. Republicans need to stop acting like they care now (2009-now) when they should have cared then (Nov 2000-Jan-2009 when it truly mattered). I wonder will Fox hammer the next president "IF" he is a Republican and produces no more or  no less then what Obama's doing now (by republican standards) or will they just say the new President needs more time after 3 years?

CNN is a joke,just like Carney and Obama are.They cheerleaded our empty suited president into office and totally ignored his negative baggage in the process.
The proof is in the pudding,Alls you have to do is look at the ratings to see who amercans trust more when it comes to delivering the news.
Liberals continue to be the most easily led segment of our society, that repeat talking points from the liberal left.

Fox is about as balanced as a teeter-totter with an American kid on one end and an African kid on the other.

If he didn't want to be perceived as working for a biased news network, why did he take a job at Fox?  MSNBC is news for Democrats, FoxNews is news for Republicans.  These aren't accusations, they're facts.

The Republican 's should adopt the old "Band aid" jingle and direct it at the Obama Administration and the Democrats during the upcoming campaign season, singing. "Stuck On Stupid,Cause Stupid is Stuck on You"!

I knew Henry was a Republican before he ever left CNN. You could see the anger on his face when he talked about what the Democrats were doing. Like John Roberts he belongs on Fox News. Fair & balanced my ass.

I have been pleased since Ed Henry came to Fox . I feel he does a good job and just because he has the cajones to ask a Q that the Obumbly press has been told not to. That does not mean he is unfair . I hope he continues with much success . Now as far as Fox over all in the last year alone i have seen a major slide in being Fair and Balanced but i am pretty sure i can use my OWN BRAIN and sort thru to find the facts. 2 things about Fox are really bothering me tho , ALL the AIRBRUSHED WOMEN doing the news and talk shows . I promise you could not cut thru the make up with a hammer and chisel and I am a Man who loves to see attractive women. For me when it comes to NEWS give me a Candy Crawley type , at least i know she is human and not ROBOTIC figure. 2 WHY  have a guest on an opinion show if you are going to OVER TALK, Berate , and argue with as soon as he or she speaks  such as O'Riely and the omnibus class Idiot Hannity. Bill will SHOUT over you then say oops out of time he uses the show to promote his Attempts at show business and hawking his books( ever notice his name is always the biggest words on the cover) . Hannity should be named the carl rove dick morris bob beckle juan williams hannity show same same same old tired opinions everynight. Hannity has never had an original thought since he got in this business but will quickly claim as his own thought anything that resonates well with the public .  So Yeah Henry was a good deal but Fox you have a ways to go  and i am a Proud CONSERVITIVE!

They, WH, obviously don't like the tough questions. Lame Steam Media, except Jack Trapper (ABC) recently have given the WH a pass on most pressing issues. I find it totally without merit that none of the Lame Stream have been pressing on Fast and Furious. The last week jobs bill, call it what it is, stimulus 3. Why hasn't the press pushed on this? Why haven't they held their ground on the Martha Vineyard vac. and waiting to announce his "Stimulus 3?
Why haven't they hammered him on waiting two weeks to show how he is going to pay for this money boondoggle? Why do they have to be in the tank with O'Bambam while he is sinking the ship? Are their political leanings more important than the health of this Country? Why? Why? Why?..........

'Conservative' is just another word that means 'I can't have it all if you get any', and Fox,alias Faux, Fix news is their cheerleaders.

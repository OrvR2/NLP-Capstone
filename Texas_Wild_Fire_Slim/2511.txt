See, people fear change. That's all it is. So they say certain politicians are "crazy" or "reactionary" or whatever silly label they want to put on them. But, hey, guess what? In doing so, they close a door. A door to new possibility, to new horizons in public policy and sociological discourse. Come on, what's say we open that door together? Maybe some of you are worried about what might happen if Rick Perry becomes president. Well, I found ten other ways of looking at that eventuality. And I'm sure you will agree with me that they provide some welcome perspective!

				I understand this is meant to be a humorous piece. But, as a former Obama supporter, I can see one major benefit to a Rick Perry presidency­: it would release me from the trough of anxiety, anger and near-depre­ssion I've been in over the past 2 1/2 years as I've watched the promise of "hope & change" that America voted for [except, of course, for 70% of white males over 30] "compromis­ed" out of existence.
=At least with Rick Perry, I would know what to expect. I don't think he would, like Barack Obama, become a born-again member of the opposition party even before he was sworn in.
Instead, win or lose in Congress, "President Perry" would probably try to accomplish what he promised as "Candidate Perry."
=Say, wouldn't it be wonderful if Barack Obama tried that? At least once? Please? 
Pretty please--wi­th sprinkles on top? Oh, forget it.

Firefighters Gain Ground Against Texas Wildfire‎​The News Daily Firefighters Gain Ground Against Texas Wildfire - The News Daily  Firefighters Gain Ground Against Texas Wildfire   8th September 2011 Cat: U.S News with No Comments » Firefighters gaining ground Wednesday against one of the most destructive fires in Texas history, while the government has said that the number of nearly 800 homes were lost, and the elite of the research team went in search of any of the victims of smoking ruins.Governor Rick Perry, in turn, will continue his presidential campaign, after running home after a weekend to address a crisis that will travel to California to meet with Republican rivals in his first nationally televised debate.The blaze has left at least two people dead, blackened about 45 square miles around Bastrop and cast a haze over Austin, 25 miles to the west, where the air smelled strongly of pine and cedar.Firefighters reported that the flames were at least 30 percent contained after burning uncontrolled for three days. They credited an easing of the winds from Tropical Storm Lee that had caused the fire to explode over the weekend. Nevertheless, the number of homes that the Texas Forest Service reported destroyed rose from around 600 the day before.The wildfire is the most catastrophic of more than 170 blazes that have erupted in the past week across the Lone Star State, which is perilously dry because of one of the state’s most severe droughts on record. In addition to the two victims in the Bastrop area fire whose bodies were found Tuesday, the outbreak is blamed for two deaths elsewhere.One of the two people killed in the Bastrop area fire was identified Wednesday as Michael Troy Farr, 49, who died at his home in Smithville. Bastrop County officials did not immediately release details about the second victim, who they said was found at a different location.Texas Task Force 1, a search team that was sent to New York following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, set out in the Bastrop area using dogs trained to sniff out bodies.Mike Fisher, the Bastrop County Emergency Operations Agency’s incident commander, said he didn’t know if there were any more dead, but “if there are bodies out there, that team is going to find them.”Several thousand people evacuated ahead of the fire, but only around 2,500 registered with the county.Across the state, about 1,200 firefighters battled the blazes, including crews from as far away as California and Oregon.The outbreak has made this the state’s costliest wildfire season on record, with $216 million in firefighting expenses since late 2010.The crisis is unfolding months after Perry signed a budget that cut funding to the Texas Forest Service by one-third. Yet the agency insisted that being $35 million lighter hasn’t left Texas less equipped to fight the latest fires.Under the new budget, which went into effect last week, no firefighters in the Forest Service were laid off, and the bulk of cutbacks will be felt by volunteer fire departments that were denied money for new trucks, said Robbie Dewitt, the agency’s finance officer.Moreover, the forest service said it will spend whatever is necessary from state coffers to deal with the disaster and have the expenses accounted for later by state leaders.Firefighters Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said Wednesday he would sign a request for the federal government to declare Texas a major disaster area. The White House later said President Barack Obama had telephoned Perry to make it clear the federal government will continue to provide assistance to state and local officials fighting the fire.Source : FirefightersPosts Related to Firefighters Gain Ground Against Texas WildfireTexas Wildfire Destroys Fierce 300 HomesThe uncontrolled fire southeast of Austin, Texas, has destroyed 300 homes, burned thousands of hectares and extends for more than 16 nautical miles of the ...Texas Wind fires : kill woman and child in East TexasTexas wind fires , A long-term sheriff of Texas said he was on fire faster than I had ever seen.

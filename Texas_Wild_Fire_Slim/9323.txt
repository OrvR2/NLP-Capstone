A Santa Cruz woman who served as a deputy city attorney for three coastal towns was slain during a domestic dispute while vacationing in Hawaii, and her companion is being held on suspicion of murder after surviving a leap from a cliff, authorities said Wednesday.
Officers who responded to calls about a domestic dispute at Nakalele Point on the island of Maui found the body of Celestial Cassman, 35, at about 7:30 p.m. Thursday. Authorities have not said how she died.
Police found her body about an hour after they arrived at Nakalele Point and tried to question Cassman's companion, Gerald Galaway, 38, of Santa Cruz, authorities said.
 Galaway bolted from police and jumped off a cliff, authorities said. He was found Friday morning and airlifted to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. 
Prosecutors have charged Galaway with second-degree murder and kidnapping, said John Kim, prosecuting attorney for Maui County.
Cassman, a native of Hawaii, grew up in Lake County and graduated from UC Santa Cruz. She earned her law degree from UC Davis.
She worked as an attorney in Sacramento before joining a Santa Cruz firm that provides legal services to municipalities. Cassman was serving simultaneously as a deputy city attorney for Santa Cruz, Capitola and Half Moon Bay.
 "As a beloved and integral member of our firm and, more importantly, a dear friend and colleague to all of us, she will be terribly missed," Santa Cruz City Attorney John Barisone said in a statement. "Her loss is incalculable."
 Barisone said he could not comment on the circumstances of Cassman's death. 
 Cassman also served as a member of the board of directors for Court Appointed Special Advocates of Santa Cruz County, a group that trains adult volunteers to serve as mentors to abused, neglected and abandoned children.
 "She'll be much missed by everyone on the board and on our staff," said Ken Goldstein, the group's executive director. 
Zach Friend, a spokesman for the Santa Cruz Police Department and a friend, said, "She was one of those people who would enter a room and people would gravitate toward her. They would want to spend time with her, and they were always left happier than before they encountered her." 
Friend said, "To think of a life like this cut short is just really incomprehensible."

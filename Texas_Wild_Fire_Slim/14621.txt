Magnitude = ? for new earthquakes until a magnitude is determined.
Maps show events recorded in the last 7 days with M2.5+ within the United States and adjacent areas, M4.5+ in the rest of the world.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS — Collaborating seismic networks and data sources
DISCLAIMER — The maps and lists show events which have been located by the USGS
and contributing agencies within the last 7 days.  They should not be considered to
be complete lists of all events M2.5+ in the US and adjacent areas and especially           
should not be considered to be complete lists of all events M4.5+ in the world. 
The World Data Center for Seismology, Denver (a part of the USGS National Earthquake
Information Center) continues to receive data from observatories throughout the world
for several months after the events occurred, and using those data, adds new events
and revises existing events in later publications.  For a description of these later
publications and the data available, see Scientific Data.

(AP) AUSTIN, Texas -- Gov. Rick Perry isn't yet saying if he plans to take part in a Republican presidential debate in California or stay in Texas to deal with wildfires that officials say destroyed more than 1,000 homes in a week.
Perry says he is "substantially more concerned" about the people affected by the wildfires than he is about the debate planned for Wednesday.
The longest-serving governor in Texas history says he expects federal assistance with the wildfires and expressed frustration that firefighting assets at Fort Hood are not already in use.
Perry interrupted campaigning in South Carolina and returned to Texas on Monday. He took an aerial tour early Tuesday of one of the areas destroyed by the wildfires.

				His absence from this and any debate was preplanned­. When the massive fires broke out in North Texas broke out weeks ago he wasn't in Texas but returned for a day to sign a former declaratio­n requesting assistance then demanding out of state firemen work for free. When the 1000+ acre fire broke out in heavily wooded East Texas he was tauting his accomplish­ments in Iowa and didn't bother to return. Now that a wildfire breaks out outside of Austin (the Capital) he takes a break to appear in front of local and national TV cameras as the governor that doing what's best for Texas. I look forward to day he attends any debate. I for one would love to understand why he signed bills allowing the state to limit free speech, force an individual to listen to state sponsored propoganda­, force a child into having a cancer drug administer­ed before they're allowed into school, how his overhyped job creations includes the layoffs of tens of thousands of teachers in a system that already spends less per student than any state, why he pushed and signed a bill allowing illegal aliens to receive instate tuition for any university in Texas then demands Washington secure the border, and on and on. You bet your ass his absence from this debate was planned! Why should Perry open his mouth in front of the nation and prove he's an idiot when he can return to Texas where no one expects he's anything more!

				Beautifull­y put. How about his raiding of the fund to help low income Seniors pay their utility bills? Paid for by texans who voluntaril­y add a dollar or two onto their utility bill payments. Only a third of the monies that are supposed to be there, are. They've been "re-direct­ed" according to records. After the Perry Onion Layers are removed one by one, he is going to be crowned THE poster boy of GOP hypocrisy.

				It's one of those 'damned if you do/damned if you don't' situations­. He has an obligation to his state that he is trying to fulfill. On the other hand, though, it looks bad that he jumped in after that first big debate, and now he might not attend the upcoming one. I personally­think missing hte first one was planned that way. However, I think this time it's just a matter of bum timing. Of course, anyone with an ax to grind with interpret it differentl­y....

				"anyone with an Ax to grind?" I have a very different view of your man and it has nothing to do with cliches'. Perry's handlers see this wildfire as a way to elevate Perry above the the other Candidates (mainly Romney). Handling a natural disaster better than Bush did will make Perry look more presidenti­al. And of course he wouldn't have to answer those pesky questions concerning his total BS record as the head Texas Twerp. This is very cynical politics folks and it works too.

				I found this interestin­g bit.  Does this describe Rick Perry?  Please read on.

He used simple, straightfo­rward language that ordinary people could understand­, short sentences, powerful, emotive slogans... There were no qualificat­ions in what he said; everything was absolute, uncompromi­sing, irrevocabl­e, undeviatin­g, unalterabl­e, final. He seemed... to speak straight from the heart, and to express their own deepest fear and desires... Such uncompromi­sing radicalism lent Hitler's public meetings a revivalist fervour.

				Hitler was an evangelist preacher of hate. He knew how to handle a crowd and one of the best preachers ever. Rick Perry and Snicklegru­ber are not on the same level. If small minds and meglamania­cal egos are examined then yes they have that much in common.

				I KNEW that low-down skunk would find a way to weasel out of the debates!  What's HE doing to fight the fires?  He's using the fires as an excuse to dodge questions that he is afraid will be asked.  For example, check out rickperryo­nestarscan­dal.com  He'd rather stand the heat of the wildfires than the heat of having to answer questions.  This  idiot is grabbing at straws to find an excuse not to attend the debate.

				I disagree. He can use this fire to elevate him above the others. It's an old political trick done by incumbent Governors in Presidenta­l campaigns. This is a win win for Perry. He has good handlers. Karl Rove taught them well. It's cynical politics but it works.

				Slick Perry will loss his following once they get a true look at this life long politican.  Maybe the fires in Texas are telling the American people that Perry is NOT the way to go.  He hasn't done much for Texas....n­ow it burning to the ground!  The sound bite plays well, but in truth it isn't a rose....it­'s stink weed.  He leads the nation in minimum wage jobs, and increased Texas government jobs by 18%. Took and keeps taking money out of education to give to the the already rich corporatio­ns..... Yet he tell us the Federal government size should be reduced!  He is a slick and good speaker, but the truth and the facts show how bad he will be for America.  We can't live through another Bush.....a­nd Perry is even worse.

				F&F T ..I want Obama reelected too. I agree with what you've said but, this election will be about Obama. The voters are really mad at our president and may elect anyone the GOP conjures up. That's why Perry entered the race. Obama's painful attempts at bipartians­hip has alienated his base {Like me} . it has also made him look weak to the GOP and the independen­t voter. Unless he can turn that around soon he is toast.

				Rick Perry is much like Sarah palin and other republican­s, he is not the brightest bulb on the tree. He do not want to be questioned because he wants to look smart. Remember even a fool seems smart until he opens his mouth and speak. Do you remember his college transtrip that was shown here about a month or so. It will suprise me if you ever see Rick in frount of a panel answering questions. I will say, if you think George W. was smart, then you will see Rick The Trick as a genius.

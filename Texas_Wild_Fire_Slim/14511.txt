        1. Pope takesmust be able to choose the pope. Discard soft or those still a little green, because during cooking do not totally evaporate enough water and instead of being firm and crunchy, they end up flabby. Although the bags just eat from the pan, soften breeze.Stay with the toughest. 2. Size MattersAccording to the renowned chef Heston Blumenthal of The Fat Duck, the ideal size for a potato chip is between 6 and 7 mm wide. This thickness ensures good surface contact with the oil in cooking. 3. Secret Rinsethe potatoes before cooking, it is washed with cold water to remove excess starch, which is responsible for sticking together. This procedure also helps to get good crispy fries. 4. Used is bettercooking of the potato takes longer if done in oil again. An oil reused ad nauseum (as in many restaurants) burnt aftertaste that is not pleasing to the palate. Neither extreme is good. The balance point is the oil filter that was used two or three times. 5. Generous oil-rich To make fries, you need a good amount of oil. Even cooking is guaranteed when the potatoes are fully submerged. So throw oil in the pan without fear, you can reuse. 6. Triplet or doubletIf you have time, it is best to give a bleaching or pre-cooking the potatoes in boiling water, frying and freezing for a few minutes, before giving a second firing. Do you get much work fiaca? I boiled the potatoes until almost fully cooked, cool it and then throw it in the pan. 7. The law of iceis a fix: if you freeze out richer. Why? In the freezer, the water containing the Pope turns to ice and destroys the cell structure, leaving a creamy inside and an outside, free of excess liquid is a better color to make contact with the oil. 8. TemperatureIf the oil is too hot, burn the potatoes. The ideal temperature is between 120 ° CC and 150 ° C for the first firing, and 175 ° C for the second. To find the right temperature, pull a piece of bread to the pan. If you stay in the background is about 150 ° C, rises rapidly to 175 ° C, if roasting is that you overdid it with fire. 9. It is too muchmakes the fries in batches. If you put too much cool the oil and potatoes you are going to be soft and pale. Patience, are just a few minutes. 10. The question of saltis best salted potato chips or well out of the pan. This helps to absorb excess oil and crisp look good. When you add the salt before cooking, you run the risk that the potato is tender.        1 of 5        
A staple also has a science to get just right. The tips to bear in mind to prepare at home and in the best restaurants: golden, crunchy and warm

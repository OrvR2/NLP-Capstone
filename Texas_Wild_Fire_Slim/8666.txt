A look at economic developments around the globeBy The Associated Press | AP – 17 hrs ago





A look at economic developments and activity in major stock markets around the world Wednesday:___KARLSRUHE, Germany — Germany's high court on Wednesday upheld the country's participation in emergency measures to fight the eurozone debt turmoil, but ruled that lawmakers had to vet future plans to commit taxpayer money, potentially slowing decision-making in a fast-moving crisis.___LONDON — Global stocks rebounded from recent hefty losses as investor sentiment was buoyed by a German court decision backing the country's participation in European bailouts as well as by forecast-busting industrial production figures.Germany's DAX closed up 4.1 percent while France's CAC-40 rose 3.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 index ended 3.1 percent higher.___TOKYO — In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index, which fell Tuesday to its lowest level since April 2009, advanced 2 percent.Australian shares did particularly well after figures showed the economy expanded 1.2 percent in the quarter through June, rebounding from a 0.9 percent contraction in the previous three months. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 2.7 percent.South Korea's Kospi clawed back the prior day's losses to surge 3.8 percent.Mainland Chinese shares gained, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index up 1.8 percent. The smaller Shenzhen Composite Index advanced 2.4 percent.___BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe's largest economy will avoid sliding back into recession after official figures showed industrial production in Germany surged far more than anticipated in July.___CANBERRA, Australia — Australia avoided recession with its economy growing 1.2 percent in the three months through June after shrinking in the previous quarter due to natural disasters at home and abroad, according to government figures.___LISBON, Portugal — Portugal paid a higher interest rate to borrow $1.2 billion in a debt auction that reflected continuing market nervousness about the eurozone's fiscal health.___TORONTO — Canada's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged and said the need to boost the rate has diminished.___GENEVA — The U.S. has tumbled further down a global ranking of the world's most competitive economies, landing at fifth place because of its huge deficits and declining public faith in government, a global economic group said.___

@Igme Yes GMA being the president may be directly responsible to our deteriorating economy but to blame her of the surge and ups of Peso to Dollar exchange rate is unfair. FYI, the value of our currency depends on our gold reserves under the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. The BSP could only print bank notes equivalent to the value of that gold reserve- otherwise, we will suffer inflation kung sobra at talagang bababa ang halaga ng ating Peso. The real problem on the stock market is its instability- parang alon kung malalaki ay mapanganib- Today you might have gained a couple of million bucks, but come tomorrow you lose some or even more than your previous gains. They have turned the stock market to look like a slot machine- it apparently became a game of chance now.

Ang masakit na nangyari ay ang pagbababa ni Gloria ng dollar exchange rate to peso.  Nuong si Joseph umabot pa nga ng 55 pesos to 1 $.  Pagupo ni Gloria nangako siya pababain daw rate ng $ to pesos ginawa nga niya - at ang naapektuhan ng husto families ng OFW lumiit ang perang natatanggap nila at mga pensioners in $ na nakatira sa pinas.  Ano po ba dahilan bakit pinababa ni Gloria conversion?  Gumanda ba economia?  Tanga ka pala pag sinabi mong oo.  ANG NAKINABANG MGA MAYAYAMAN AT BUSINESS PEOPLE NA PINAPABURAN NI GLORIA PARA PAG IMPORT NILA NG PRODUCTS NILA KONTING PESOS LANG GAMIT NILA SO SIMPLE ANO PA.

Chinese govt. talagang very smart dahil nakipagagreement sila sa France na maging convertible pera nila.  Siguradong papataasin ng China ang conversion ng pera nila against France money thereby lalaki ang purchasing power ng France kung bibili sila ng mga Chinese products at mga tourist matutuwa dahil magmumura ang pamasahe nila at lahat ng mga bilihin nila - thereby encouraging more tourist.  Chinese govt. owned airlines, hotels, big restaurants in China kaya they have an affordable 7 day tours sa China, everything paid.  Di kayang gawin ng pinoy ito.

he opened a hotel in panama whose owners of the rooms are investors.  they invest and get nothing from it. but just the name that they are the owners of the hotel... his(trumps) name conquers and he makes money( SO MANY CHARGES YOU WONT BELIEVE) and   as the management makes a contract of you now after you invested and was promised by HOMES  a broker who sold the rooms for you telling lies , you are  not making money after the hotel is ready with this new contract even though you are the owner... what a shame . WAS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE INFORMED BY TRUMP BEFORE THE INVESTORS BUY HIS NAME PRODUCT... TELL ME IF I AM WRONG. MIGHT BE I AM WRONG..

imagine he wanted to run usa... our country would have been drilled in short.
what a fraud monster who plans after you buy as no deals wre informed earlier while you buy... shame on the guy......he makes his money this way.  he wont write it or speak about this in his next speech or discourses,   but it is the TRUTH AND I CAN GET MANY CLIENT WHO CAN VOUCVHER IT... but panama laws are different from our country USA. or else WE could have them by the Bolls. u know. 
may GOD  make him pay for our loses. he is not supernatural and he Will pay thru his health and suffer.   i just claim what is right and dont want any money or claims but just the truth. 
karma pays or gains as it sees your actions. its happiness or pain.. its paid here

Economy, is it improving or no? Well the only thing I remember about economy is always inflations...How is the economy became better kung ang inflations sa mga products are being absorb and suffered by the people....Sino ang nakinabang sa inflations na yan, walang iba kundi ung mayayaman lamang!!!

SA aking pananaw, narapat lamng na icontain or iwasan ng gobyerno ang mga speculations/preditions regarding inflation targets....Kc kapag inaallow ng gobyerno ang inflation at sila pa ang nagprepredict niot, eh siguradong magkaroon ng inflations....Pero kung ang gobyerno ay perdicting any NO INFLATIONARY MEASURES' siguradong maiiwasan ang inflations sa bansa....

Kelangan ang gobyerno dapat ay manindigan na everything is under its control at walang anumang pahiwatig na magkakaroon ng inflations...Bakit ngayon napakabilis tumaas ang prices ng commodities, iyan ay dahil gobyerno (BSP) mismo ang nagpredict nito...pero kung walang announcements/predictions sa mga un siguradong hindi magtataas ng prices ang mga producto...Ung prices ng noodles, bakit halos nagdoble na sa loob lamang ng isang taon, grabe nmn!!! Pagdating ng panahon, paano na kakain ng mahal na mga producto eh hindi nmn bwan bwan nagtataas ng sahod....

PLEASE AVOID INFLATION PREDICTIONS KC SILA ANG NAGBIBIGAY DAAN SA TOTOONG PAGTAAS NG MGA PRODUCTO......maawa nmn kayu sa mga tao, mga negosyante lang kc ang nakikinabang sa inflatins na yan!!!

If Standard and Poor actually downgrade the US's credit rating, wouldn't they just be shooting themselves in the foot? It seems many economies depend on the US and we in turn depend on them as well. Everyone would suffer. Including Standard and Poor. Now is that really smart?

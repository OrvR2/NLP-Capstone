@selvmordspilot Low is not what that person says. Nor the topic. Low is their﻿ attitude.

@theBartone9119 "I feel like I'm﻿ arguing with a religious person about the existence of God(...)" - man, you just pointed your own issue thinking you would get victorious from that discussion. I mean, you are the one believing in such things like physical scarcity, or that most of countries aren't poor because you mentioned 3 european countries that seem﻿ to be fine. You believe in things like money incentive. Even if we scientifically prove those things to be wrong you'll still ignore them...

@vltakacs : i﻿ laughed. There is nothing low about that. I pointed out the obvious contradiction, there is nothing low about that. And I offered him help, in case he was being sincere. I know the internet, and i know how trolling works. I also know there's a lot of plainly ignorant people out there in need of some direction.

@theBartone9119 "There are not enough resources on the planet to give an abundance for everyone." - To commence with; are you suggestting that you﻿ need all the trillions of junk food stores out there? Are you aware that most of super markets who sell food, waste tons of them when it becomes out of date? When this could easily feed the whole globe? I am not talking about one example... If you know that then you are again being intelectually dishonest just to support the current system!

@selvmordspilot
You are being dragged down to amongst idiots. You are just﻿ being provoked.

Guys do not respond to trolling.
"Never argue with an idiot, they drag you down to﻿ their level and beat you"
Who want to, understand. Who don't, they can only blame themselves for living blindfolded.

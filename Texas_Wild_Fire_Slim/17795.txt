This Tuesday, live like the celebrities do. Or at least read links about them.
Pop Royalty: Anxiously waiting to see what Beyoncé and Jay-Z name their child? While you wait, check out a history of celebrity offspring. (Flavorwire)
Laugh Legend: Comedian Louis C.K. gives a touching, hilarious tribute to the late George Carlin. As expected, be warned — there's some salty language. (The Daily What)
Facebook Fame: Vanity Fair has released its 2011 New Establishment rankings. If you saw TIME's Person of the Year pick, their top spot won't surprise you. (Vanity Fair)
Muggle Must: A TIME reporter and his young daughter take on Pottermore, J.K. Rowling's interactive version of her Harry Potter series. (TIME)
Fashion Forward: To ease into the work week, check out pretty people wearing pretty clothing in a pretty city. Yes, it's the red carpet at the Venice Film Festival. (LIFE)
Heartstring-Tugger: Try not to tear up at this video of lab chimps seeing sunlight for the first time. Sniff. (Huffington Post)

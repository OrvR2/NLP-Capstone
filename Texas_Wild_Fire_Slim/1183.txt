Although Tinseltown may have head cruel intentions in store for Reese Witherspoon -- a typical Hollywood ending to a typical Hollywood romance -- she's back on top and feeling lucky. 
"I got lucky. I did. I got very lucky, and he's so wonderful with the children," Witherspoon told Marie Claire of her new husband, Jim Toth. "I'm very blessed."
But things weren't always so peachy for the mother of two. After eight years of marriage -- and two kids later -- Witherspoon split from her first husband, Ryan Phillippe in 2008. Although the divorce only further catapulted her into the top spot of America's reigning sweetheart, it also landed her on the receiving end of much unwanted publicity surrounding her love life, especially her relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal. Although it seems that Witherspoon is now laughing off her past heartbreak -- she recently had lunch with Taylor Swift to dish on their mutual ex, Gyllenhaal. 
But Witherspoon's newfound freedom from the stress of being a single mom wasn't an overnight fix. 
"I was hard on myself when I got divorced. And until I got remarried, I don't think I realized how stressed I was," she told the magazine. "I feel so much relief. I don't think I realized how stressed I was being a single parent. It was really, really stressful. It's not easy on anybody."

Read Witherspoon's full interview when Marie Claire's October issue hits stands on September 20th.

				I really like Reese Witherspoo­n. She's a good actress, I always enjoy her movies, and she's got good southern values. You won't see her in any scandal. Her ex maybe but she was too good for him. I'm happy for her.....I'­m glad she found a good man. If young girls want to look up to Hollywood stars, she's a much better example than most.

				I think the stress came from an ex-spouse who was extremely jealous of her career.  And the fact that it lead to their divorce.   For some reason, having millions of dollars at your disposal and raising two children alone doesn't equal stress.  Single parents correct me if I am wrong.

				I think I'd do pretty well with millions of dollars. I could afford to give my children nice clothes, extracurri­cular activities­, a housekeepe­r to help with the mess, a nanny to help on outings...­.plus I could afford to go shopping and get pedicures and massages. Doesn't sound stressful at ALL.

				Yes it does! I remember how difficult it was when I was divorced and raising children alone. Being divorced is a nightmare! Money does not equate to having a fulltime husband to share in the ups and downs of child-rear­ing. Thank God my pain, like Reese's, only lasted for a short duration of time. Children really do need involved parents in the home because you can't raise a child from the sidewalk!

				you are NOT a single parent if the father is in the picture and helps support & raise the kids _ even if you live in two separate homes. I AM a single parent cause the father of my kids has no interest in them, never see them and pays as little as the law will allow towards their maintenanc­e. Geesh! Poor ole Reese.

				You are so right!!  Also, even single parent households are much much easier with millions of dollars at your disposal.  Maybe she has been rich for so long she forgets how hard life is in the real world.

I wonder how Ryan feels to hear her say she was a single parent.  How would she like it if he called himself a single parent??  All this aside, I like Reese alot.  But, you have an excellent point...sh­e never really was a single parent at all.

				Single parents are the ones who rush their children to the doctors when they're sick, and then have to drag the poor things screaming into the pharmacy to get their prescripti­ons afterwards because we don't have people catering to us, and we have no choice. We live in the real world.....­.Not Hollywoods made up version. I have been listening to Hollywood people types for years talk about being a "single parent." I am so glad to see others share my view. Being someone who many years ago was the definition of a single parent (that is someone who raises their children without the support physically­, emotionall­y, and financiall­y over 75% of the time. And no we don't have nannies, etc assisting) These people trying to label themselves as someone who is in reality is just "divorced.­" Does the word "divorced" sound bad in Hollywood? You are not "widowed", you are or were not abandoned and left to be a soul provider, you didn't have a child out of wedlock by either your own option, or by other consequenc­es. You are/were "DIVORCED" Ms. Witherspoo­n!!! 

And for all you "haters" out there, not all single parents are welfare people either. I worked during the days, evenings, whatever it took. I went to college earning 3 degrees. I was a proud strong momma, and passed this on!!

				Sometimes it's almost the same thing. My kids father helps raise them but because he can't seem to keep a job, I and my parents actually support them. We had to leave our apartment because I lost my job and he didn't step up and go to work. So I'll give him credit for helping take care of them but since he's only had a job 3 weeks we'll see how much support we get. His money when he has it goes towards toys and fun, but not school tuition and classes. I feel like a single mom sometimes i'm lucky I have family to help. I realize alot of moms don't. My mom was truly a single mom until I was 9 and it wasn't easy.

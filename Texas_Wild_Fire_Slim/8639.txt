I LOVE MY VIBRAMS!  Get them.  You'll be glad you did.  They make you WANT to go running.  They do take a bit of time getting used to.  At first, go on some short runs.  Your calves WILL feel it while you're getting used to them.  But once you are, you will LOVE them!  I promise.

I can only speak from personal experience, but I have tried the Vibram FiveFinger shoes and I no longer want to use "regular" running shoes. The only soreness I experience is in the muscle. No more joint or bone pain and I have had knee surgery. I am up to 8 miles in my VFFs and am working my way to a marathon!

I love how people start saying that you will spend half your life in a doctor because of a type of shoe. LOL
If you want to do the right thing, consult with a doctor first. Check your whole body (not just your feet) and find out your weakness and strength. 
Do your research, and choose accordingly to your body needs.
If you are in a general “good condition”, meaning your body doesn’t have any mayor defects, you should be able to use the “second skin” as your will be running as nature designed your body to run. Simple. But if you have any problem, then you should ALWAYS consult with your doctor and choose the best shoes that are designed for your specific problem. 
We did not invent technology for nothing. It is there to help us. But at the same time, you should not ignore the natural ways of things. Evolution is the master of all species on our planet, and as far as we can tell, mother nature has done a very good job.
I particularly use combinations of different shoes, from almost barefoot, to fully protected, depending of the situation. I do have some problems on my knees, and believe or not, the bare foot running (or almost bare) is one of the best solutions to my problem.
Listen do specialists, to advertising, and then use your brain to decide. And if you make a mistake, then correct it. You might have to try more than one pair of shoes before you find the best one.

Got to love this shoeless or minimalist shoe fad. You people are going to be paying for so many Doctor's Mercedes and Rolls Royces, etc. in the coming decade. Orthopedists will love you guys.

vibram five fingers are the way to go.  Got foot, shin, knee, leg or hip pain?  VFF's take care of it!

By watching this video, did anyone "learn what qualities in shoes you should seek for the best workout"?  I sure didn't.

I love my Vibram shoes. Though I use them for hiking instead of running.

If you land on your heel first, you will eventually overload your cartilage in your knees.
Wearing shoes with thick sole solves the problem, but it makes you land on your heels.
You do not need to buy a new pair of second skin, if you condition yourself to land on your ball, instead.

Shoes with thick soles altered your way of running.  You do not need to switch to a new product, in order to reclaim the "correct" way of landing.

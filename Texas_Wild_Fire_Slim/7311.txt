‘It’s been a battle’: Crews’ coordination credited with saving homes

 | 

From The Longview News-Journal
Volunteer fire crews from Sabine, Quitman, Holly Lake, Edgewood, Hawkins, Haynesville and Wills Point, along with the Canton Fire Department, have assisted the Longview Fire Department in responding to Gregg County wildfires since Sunday. Resources from Gregg County helped battle blazes in Gladewater, Kilgore, Longview, White Oak, Harrison County, Elderville/Lakeport and Jefferson.
Other participating agencies include the Texas Forest Service, Gregg County Precincts 1 and 3 road crews, the Gregg County Sheriff’s Department, Longview police, the city of Longview, the Department of Public Safety, the East Texas Council of Governments, local Ham radio operators and businesses that donated bulldozers, water tankers and other equipment.

More than two dozen volunteer, business and governmental entities that have rallied against Gregg County wildfires since Sunday appeared to be gaining the upper hand by Tuesday. With coordinated fire fighting, officials said those efforts resulted in saving an untold number of homes and other structures.
On Tuesday, the third full day of flames that charred thousands of Northeast Texas acres, Gregg County Judge Bill Stoudt surveyed the continuing fire threats from the air.
Even before his takeoff, the news was improving. “It’s been a battle, but we know we’re getting the best of them right now,” Stoudt said. “I was thinking: my first couple of years (in office), we had (Hurricanes) Katrina and Rita, and that was when we really saw the value of getting an Emergency Operations Center.”
That central coordinating office, in the AT&T building west of the Gregg County Courthouse, was activated Monday. “The United States Forest Service took an early lead, and we moved into operational mode in the EOC around noon,” Stoudt said. “I think at one time we had five or six fires going at one time around the county.”
Battling the blazes was a juggling act for manpower and equipment. “We were shifting manpower around — once we’d get containment on one (fire), we were shifting manpower to another one,” he said. “To coordinate all these people was just pretty incredible.”
Longview Mayor Jay Dean joined in recognizing those on the front lines and those supporting them. “This is an unprecedented time for Gregg County,” Dean said Tuesday. “And in the 30 years that I’ve been in East Texas, I’ve never seen anything like this.”
Crews continued to be on the scene at fires in Diana, southern White Oak, north of Longview, near New London, Kilgore, Tatum, Waskom and points between Tuesday afternoon.
Texas Forest Service spokesman Lee McNeely said there had been an unknown number of firefighters from the other 49 states, as well as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, in the region.
Stoudt urged residents to halt all activity that might result in a fire under continued drought conditions. “We have a very serious event taking place. We don’t need additional reasons to start fires,” he said at a Tuesday morning news conference.
“People need to be aware of this and take it seriously. If you see a fire, see smoke, you report it to the authorities.”
A mandatory evacuation was ordered Tuesday afternoon for residents on both sides of Texas 135 at Swamp City Road/FM 2209 south of Gladewater. Fire Marshal Johnny Zackary said the blaze was about 50 percent contained Tuesday evening.
The City of Longview continued to have its Maude Cobb Convention and Activity Center open for evacuees from all counties. Dean said arrangements also could be made for pets and livestock.
Col. John Tanner, leader of the Air Land Emergency Resource Team outside Gladewater, said 11 ALERT Academy members were dispatched to the Swamp City fires Tuesday. They joined Gregg County, Longview and volunteer firefighters in a day-long fire fight.
Winds that were furious Sunday and Monday calmed, for the most part, Tuesday. Tanner reported strong winds still prevailed at ALERT’s U.S. 80 campus.
“All it takes is heat or a spark, fuel — there’s plenty of it around right now — and then the oxygen,” Tanner said.
He said he had not encountered many evacuees looking for temporary shelter. “It seems like everybody is going to friends or family,” he said.
East Texas Council of Governments Director David Cleveland said resources were strained by mid-day Monday in the council’s 14-county region. “All known regional assets were currently being engaged,” he said. “This is a statewide issue. We’ve got 60-plus fires going on.”
He credited Gregg County with being “well-prepared” for such disasters, an assessment the council’s homeland security coordinator echoed. “They (in Gregg County) are very progressive,” Coordinator Donetta Murphy said, adding other counties were stretching their limits. “They are pulling from everything they have. There’s so many fires, and it’s just so big it’s taking everything they have.”
After his mid-afternoon flyover, Stoudt said the sight had been both intimidating and comforting. “I really was taken aback at how large the fire is in Gladewater,” he said.
“That is a big area, a big area. If it isn’t over 1,000 acres, I’d be surprised.”
The fire in the northern part of the county, largely contained by Tuesday afternoon, left a dramatic imprint on the Pineywoods, he added.
“We did save a lot of structures in the northern part of the county,” Stoudt said. “And we lost a lot of structures.” He said the view from the air offered good and bad news.
“There was just a big tract of land that the fire had burned through — to see that big, huge forest, and now it’s just burned up,” he said, turning soon to the comforting news.
“If you saw what I saw from the air — there are a lot of structures burned around them, but the houses are still standing. … I have never been so proud of the citizens of Gregg County, and the volunteer firefighters and the pros, and what they have done for this county. I got the privilege of seeing that.”

Mookie: Amazing.  Hat's off to y'all!  Stay safe....Kim Gillihan: Thanks to your brother and all other fighting these fires!Fookie: Darla - I don't know the circumstances surrounding the offer of assistance by these good men.  However, it is very unusual for anyone to walk on to the scene of an emergency without belonging to an organization such as a CERT group or emergency service provider.  I hope these men will take the opportunity to join up with a local fire department, EMS provider or disaster service like Red Cross so that their expertise can best be utilized.Fookie: Texas-Fire does its best to provide accurate information that we glean from various sources.  The above story comes from KLTV, KYTX and www.cbs19.tvFookie: Try these links.  Second one is a good map.

Glenn Close's Big Screen Transformation: Will 'Albert Nobbs' Finally Land the Actress an Oscar?The Victorian-era film could give its star major awards buzz. Here's the inside look at the physical transformation that's making it possible.The Hollywood Reporter – 17 hours ago

Albert Nobbs

Could Albert Nobbs nab its main star a Best Actor Oscar at next year’s Academy Awards? Not possible, but close! Glenn Close, that is.The actress is getting lots of awards-season buzz after her gender-swapping role as the titular Albert Nobbs in Rodrigo Garcia’s new movie which premieres at the Toronto Film Festival September 11.

	Close has been nominated five times at the Oscars, but has never 
won. Historically, stepping this far outside of the box has worked for 
others (see: Charlize Theron in Monster or Marion Cotillard for La Vie en Rose), so why not Close?
The film, set in 19th century Ireland, is about a woman who passes 
herself off as a man in order to work at an elegant hotel in Dublin. To 
pull it off, Close changed her voice, posture (Charlie Chaplin
 was an inspiration), and kept her eyes open wide. Even her fashion 
choices were affected. Close said her shoes were too big for her, her 
pants were too long and her suit was too roomy, to emphasize the 
character's discomfort in her own skin.

The film has been a pet-project for Close since she first played the character on the stage in New York in 1982.
She also worked with a makeup artist to transform her features from 
feminine to masculine. Close said the 20 year gap between playing the 
character on stage and the start of filming added a "lived-in" aspect to
 her visage.
Some are saying this transformative performance, for which even her 
voice changed, is the actress’ best shot at the golden statue in years. 
The actress is so passionate about the project, she even co-wrote the 
adaptation. She told the Hollywood Reporter
 it was a very rare and tricky character to play because of her purity. 
 "I loved Nobbs because in her ignorance, she tries to create a life for
 herself," Close said.

This isn't the first time Close has cross-dressed on film. She had a brief cameo in Steven Spielberg's Hook
 back in 1991. She was almost unrecognizable as pirate (she even wore a 
beard) who gets sentenced to punishment in Captain Hook's "Boo" box.
But Close hasn't given the only performance garnering awards buzz at this year’s festival.
Viggo Mortensen, Keira Knightley and Michael Fassbender are getting good reviews for David Cronenberg's A Dangerous Method. George Clooney is packing a double punch with The Descendents and The Ides of March and his buddy Brad Pitt stars alongside Oscar-winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Bennett Miller's Moneyball.
The festival, traditionally seen as an informal kick-off to the falls
 awards season, begins Thursday and runs through September 18.See clips from 'Albert Nobbs':

Glenn Close is so awesome and so-o-o-o talented.Ck out her new movie "Albert Nobbs" such talent has to be rewarded with an Oscar for her this year.

Glenn Close is probably the best actress of her generation to have NEVER won an Oscar, which I think, given her immense talent, is a travesty of justice.  I really this role finally nabs her the Academy Award for which she's long overdue.  All the best, Glenn!

I guess Philippine movie industry can not help but depict its movie stars as their commercial iconry dictate. Regardless of role, Philiipine movie stars are, most of the time, made up to look like advertising/product promotions models.

A woman playing a man, how original. and its a fiction book, again original.

Now there are so many real people who have had to live in opposite sex bodies in real life for the last 6000 years that no ones real story could be found to be made into a movie.

I like Glenn Close, hope she wins an Oscar, but for the idea of the movie, it sucks. 10 out of 100.

Looking forward to seeing Glenn Close in the movie Albert Nobbs. It's about a19th cent. Irish women who dresses as a man in order to get a job.

What pathetic little mosters most of you are....your comments are like those of a petulant spoiled brat....what would any of you know about talent since you have none...Glenn Closse is one of the finest actors of our time and out of the mouths of you petty brats comes what your tiny minds can come up with....you are all so astoundingly small minded. It goes to show that only the most shallow people comment on these yahoo articles.

After what seemed like a lifetime of thirty-Year adjustable-rate mortgages, with monthly mortgage payments going up all the time, The "123 Refinance" helped me to lock in a great low fixed rate of 3.16%, helping me to guarantee myself the ability to always make my mortgage payment on time with money to spare.

Katia weakened to a Category 3 hurricane early Tuesday morning, but it still churned in the Atlantic Ocean and threatened to unleash dangerous rip currents, forecasters said.
As of 5 a.m. Tuesday, Katia was about 400 miles (645 kilometers) south of Bermuda and carried maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 kph), according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. It was moving northwest at about 10 mph (17 kph).
The storm is expected to avoid the United States. The front moving the remnants of Tropical Depression Lee up the East Coast is actually anticipated to help keep Katia offshore, according to CNN's weather bureau.

These above comments were allowed by a moderator??  You children use your own facebook or twitter to respond to yourselves.  Immature.

O.o
No mod here, Miss Priss. 
Oh, and what do you think of the story?
I found it delightfully immature, with a strong aftertaste of smokey sarcasm.

Good job at keeping Katia at bay.
Now we have something else showing up in the southern gulf.  See if you can dance that one to Texas.

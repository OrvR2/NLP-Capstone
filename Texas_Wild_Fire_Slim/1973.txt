9/11 the Day We Became the True 'United' StatesBy Janice LanePostsWebsiteBy Janice Lane | Yahoo! Contributor Network – 11 hrs ago






Yahoo! is asking Americans how September 11 changed them. Below is an account from a reader.


  It is the day that will always be remembered -- September 11. I am from Virginia, and I was teaching at a middle school in Houston. I taught my broadcast journalism class as another teacher came in saying, "The Trade Center has been hit or something."


  She turned on the television in my classroom, and we could not believe our eyes. As I watched the reports with my students, my husband called to tell me to call my mom because the Pentagon had been hit. I suddenly felt like I had been hit. My mom worked at the Marine Corps headquarters, located in the Navy Annex and overlooks the Pentagon from a small hill.


  I also have an aunt who worked in the Pentagon at that time and an aunt who worked a few minutes away in Crystal City. My mom frequently went to the Pentagon to pick up items for her office and, on that day, I did not know if she was supposed to be there. With phone lines not working, I continued to try.


  [Your story: How has September 11 changed you?]


  In the midst of trying, parents began to take their children out of school. By then, I had reached my planning period so I helped an overloaded office. In between, I finally reached my grandmother who had heard from my mom and gave me a number to reach her after confirming that all other family members in the area were safe.


  I shook as I dialed the number, and as soon as I heard her voice, I immediately started crying. The principal's secretary had to talk to her for me. She had to ride home with one of her co-workers because she could not get home immediately. We all come together in times of need, and total strangers had come together to seek safety. I was relieved to hear her voice, but at that moment, I felt so much pain for the victims and their families. All of the emotion I felt from my fear and for America came pouring out.


  Family has always been important to me, and on that day, the entire United States became my family. After that day, my mom and I made a vow to talk every day after then because we never know what day could be our last. That is what I want most people to understand as many of us bicker over some of the smallest things and even stop speaking. My mom and I talked every day for many years, and now, if we do not talk within a day or so, we at least text. As I write this, my tears are flowing as if it was yesterday. Even after ten years, it is still fresh, and I still remember that vow we made. The tragic event spoke and still speaks volumes to me and our country. It is the day we all became the true "United" States -- one family.

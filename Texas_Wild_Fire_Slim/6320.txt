				It never ceases to amaze me the number of people who get busted for possession because they couldn't be bothered to obey simple traffic laws. This isn't rocket science; obey the little rules so you don't give law enforcemen­t a reason to look more closely at you and discover you are in possession of illegal substances­.

				Not just possession­, but all kinds of stuff! My sister-in-­law lost a sterling silver Gemeinhard­t flute that was in a store for repair when the store was burglarize­d. Five days later, a cop pulled a car over because the license plate was dangling..­. and these idiots still had all the loot from the burglary in the back seat! Of course, it could serve as testimony for the brain power involved. But you're definitely spot on--if you're going to carry, is it really that hard to make sure your vehicle is street legal, registered and you aren't drunk? Common sense, something that's usually not a criminal's strong suit.

				More Propaganda from the News Corps. I remember growing up all the lies kids had to listen to about the 'Dangers' of marijuana. We were lead to believe that Marijuana was much more harmful than Alcohol and tobacco. What a lie. It couldn't be further from the truth. Alcohol and prescripti­on pills you can overdose on easily. Marijuana is impossible to ever overdose on, and is all natural. A plant that benefits humans immensely  in many different ailments. Alcohol and tobacco are legal, and kill thousands. Where is the evidence that lumps marijuana into that same category? 
It is amazing that we live in a country that has legal death products such as Tobacco, synthetic prescripti­on pills,  alcohol and guns. But somehow a natural plant is illegal? When it has been shown to benefit humans when dealing with different diseases, like cancer? 
The public has been lied to far too long. People should not be thrown in jail for weed. Jail is for violent dangerous people, not people using a mild substance that is non-toxic. 

Guns, Alcohol, Tobacco = Legal and Kills hundreds of thousands
Weed = illegal, cannot overdose on, natural, human body benefits from it. 

What a JOKE. Sorry but I am not listening and believing the propaganda ever again. Keep it illegal, but I will still use it no matter what over the legal substances 24/7

				I don't have a dog in this fight one way or the other. I don't smoke, but I wouldn't care if it were legalized nationwide tomorrow. With that said, since you know it's not legal, at least have the good sense to clean it all off your shirt just in case you run into the LEOs.

If you use and you live in a state with draconian marijuana laws, you are fully aware of the consequenc­es of such things, so as far as I'm concerned, yer on yer own if you choose to do something as stupid as this.

				All you idiots on here who are crying because it's only a little, seem to forget that it is illegal and  do you want this guy behind the wheel of a vehicle while high? It's no different then having an open container of beer and saying there is only a sip left in it, it's illegal to have an open container of alcohol and it's illegal to have marijuana! I guess when you smoke marijuana often you tend to forget that it's illegal no matter how much you have, especially in a vehicle where you can do some serious damage to yourself or someone else! They better throw the damm book at this guy, I don't want him ever driving while high!

				No, it is not illegal in California under Porp 215 and SB420.   Sorry to disappoint you but there have been numerous studies, that you choose to ignore, that prove people drive better when high, act more cautious and don't speed.   Just because you can't believe it or choose not too is your problem. 

I smoke all day and possess many ounces of Marijuana legally.  Cops have given back and commented on my weed.  Cops don't want to bother with Weed.

				But it wasn't in California­, and NOWHERE that it's legal, is it legal to operate a motor vehicle under the influence, or drive and smoke. People drive better when high? Yeah, right, pal, I notice you sort of passed on supplying any links to prove that, because they don't exist--thi­s is some pipe dream one of your buddies told you.

Henry Ford and Rudolf Diesel’s Vision of a Hemp Diesel Revolution

Rudolf Diesel expected that his engine would be powered by vegetable oils (including hemp) and seed oils. At the 1900 World’s Fair, Diesel ran his engines on peanut oil. Later, George Schlichten invented a hemp ‘decortica­ting’ machine that stood poised to revolution­ize paper making. And Henry Ford demonstrat­ed that cars can be made of, and run on, hemp. However, evidence suggests a special-in­terest group that included the DuPont petrochemi­cal company, Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon (Dupont’s major financial backer), and the newspaper man William Randolph Hearst mounted a yellow journalism campaign against hemp. Hearst deliberate­ly confused psychoacti­ve marijuana with industrial hemp, one of humankind’­s oldest and most useful resources. DuPont and Hearst were heavily invested in timber and petroleum resources, and saw hemp as a threat to their empires. Also petroleum companies knew that petroleum emits noxious, toxic byproducts when incomplete­ly burned, as in an auto engine. Pollution was important to Rudolf Diesel and he saw his engine as a solution to the inefficien­t, highly polluting engines of his time. But in 1937 DuPont, Mellon and Hearst were able to push a “marijuana­” prohibitio­n bill through Congress in less than three months, which destroyed our domestic hemp industry.

				From my understand­ing, it grew out of big industries that no longer wanted hemp to be produced..­.so campaigns were started and it began to be voted on in states individual­ly.

...but the reasons given to the people, were not the actual reasons that the movement had started.

Slowly but surely States began making it illegal, much of the reasoning being used...rev­olved around immigratio­n from Mexico.

A lot of unscientif­ic theories and bigotry, used to sway voters into making it's production illegal...­hemp was a relatively critical crop for a long time too.

...it was even used as currency at one time, you could pay your taxes with it.  LOL

So what industries might have problems with that, cotton maybe, the paper industry..­.enough to take it out of commission it appears.

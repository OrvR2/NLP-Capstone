SPRING, TX (KTRK) -- 
Detectives are trying to determine a motive after a man allegedly stabbed and killed his 10- and 8-year-old cousins before taking his own life.	
Related ContentMore: Got a story idea?  Let us know!    It happened at a house in the 6200 block of Darby Way at Northcrest  around 5:30pm  on Sunday.   According to detectives, a 23-year-old cousin was visiting the home when he attacked two of his relatives' children.   Officials said he stabbed them both in the downstairs portion of the house. He then went outside and shot himself in the driveway of the home.  The suspect is now dead. His motive is unknown at this time.  The victims were identified by family members as Hunter Archer, 10, and 8-year-old, Jhaden Archer.  Police say Hunter died inside the home and Jhaden was airlifted to Memorial Hermann Hospital, where he later died.   People close to the family say both boys were adopted. We are told the parents have at least three adopted children and at least three natural children living with them. It is believed they were all home at the time.  "We see the little boy outside all the time.  He's always outside, seemed like a good little kid.  He was in choir last year with one of our Girl Scout moms.  But that is all about we know right now just they were a quiet family," said Deanna Bowlds.   The mother of the children is also being treated at a local hospital. She collapsed shortly after the incident.  The case is still under investigation but deputies say they did not believe alcohol or mental illness played a role.

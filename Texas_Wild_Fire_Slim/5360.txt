17 million US households lack proper diet: reportAFP – 11 hrs ago

Over 17 million US households -- or 14.5 percent -- were unable to eat properly in 2010, either due to small portions, or chronically unhealthy diets, a government report said Wednesday.
Households living near or below the poverty line, single-parent households, and black or Hispanic households, were mostly affected, said the report from the Department of Agriculture.
Among those affected, some 6.4 million homes (5.4 percent) were particularly affected by food insecurity, said the report, facing smaller portions, unhealthy diets, hunger and weight loss.
Some 9.8 percent of households with children faced similar food insecurity, down slightly from 10.6 percent of the same demographic in 2009, the report said.
The "study underscores what we know, that the food security remains a serious problem," said USDA under secretary Kevin Concannon in a conference call with reporters.
The USDA last month noted that nearly 46 million people, or one-in-six Americans, were in April this year living with government-issued food stamps.

If these muds would stop breeding like cockroaches they wouldn't be starving now. Idiot animals. A sterilization program needs to be implemented immediately. If you're a non white that wants food stamps be sterilized or get nothing..

How much is this costing America in health costs, and lost productivity at work?

I imagine part of it is being stuck at home unable to find a job and getting bored and depressed and maybe even over-eating some of the cheaper varieties of food with low nutritional value but high caloric content which contributes to fat accumulation.  I'm retired and I gotta watch sittin' around and raiding the fridge and pantry so I can see how that can happen!

Omigod. I thought people were getting fat from eating fattening food. Now I find that people are getting fat because they don't have enough money (or food stamps) to get ENOUGH food.

I know the restrictions on applying for aid are really tightening up and varies from State to State, so perhaps certain undocumented aliens are excluded in certain regeons.

I think the bottom line question in all of this shouldn't be "Why are people eating like this" but instead "WHY are people eating like this?"  It's not just that they're eating poorly on food stamps, it's just that they're on food stamps in the first place.  Where are the jobs with an income capable of supporting a Family.

My mother's memories of growing up in the 1930s and 40s are of eating potatoes six nights a week, and having meat on Sunday.  They were all healthy and survived just dandy.  Now our government not only spews out a bunch of CO2 bussing children they think can't get fed at home, to school to eat breakfast, but they also send home food for them to eat at home on the weekend.  Socialism is alive and well in America.

given how many people are drawing food stamps there is no good reason for this improper diet. Just spend some time in a grocery & watch what kind of junk people buy, that is if they don't peddle their stamps before they get them or trade them for cash of lesser value. I know of several people who do this on a regular basis. Enabled by the govt they act like the govt & spend what they don't have & waste what they do get.

Given the obesity rates in the US I think this number far too low.  It isn't just the poor who eat unhealthy diets but to a tangible degree the consumer can mitigate this through better choices and eating home cooked food over fast food.  Not enough food is a very different problem.  We are well on our way to creating a system where everyone is on the dole and a system such as that can not be sustained, that is just the hard reality.

Keep educating.  Give what you can.  If you are ok, but cannot give, keep tying.

Maybe they'll find some way to tax us for having poor diets. Or even better fine us if we don't have their proper diet and jail us if we don''t comply. Michele Obama will fix it.

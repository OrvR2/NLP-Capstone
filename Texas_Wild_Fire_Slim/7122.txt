Shutdown Corner 
Sun Sep 11 11:11pm EDT
Austin, Cromartie share catch in end zone. Who gets possession? By      Chris Chase


The details of a pivotal play in the Dallas Cowboys vs. New York Jets game could have read like an SAT question: "Miles, a receiver, goes up for a ball. Antonio, a defender, goes for the same ball. Both land in the endzone, each with their arms wrapped around the ball. Who is awarded possession?"
It happened Sunday night at Met Life Stadium when Miles Austin(notes) of the Cowboys fought for a ball in the endzone with Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie(notes). They came down with the Mark Sanchez(notes) pass at the same time, wrestling with each other as they fell into the endzone with the ball between them. We knew one thing. The ball had been caught. But by whom? Look one way and you'd think Austin had it. Shift your eyes right and it was Cromartie who had possession. They couldn't both catch the ball, right? Who gets it? The receiver, who's awarded a touchdown? Or the defender, whose interception would have led to a Jets touchback?

To answer that question, officials referred to the NFL Rulebook, specifically rule 8, section 1, article 3, item 5 (there are a lot of rules in that book; it's about 10 times as long as the United States Constitution):
If a pass is caught simultaneously by two eligible opponents, and both players retain it, the ball belongs to the passers. It is not a simultaneous catch if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control.
In less-Hochulian terms: You know the "tie goes to the runner" rule in baseball? Simultaneous catch is the football equivalent. If two guys come down with the ball, somebody has to be credited with a catch and it might as well be the team that already has possession. It's a rule of convenience and common sense. Touchdown, Dallas Cowboys.
Watch the replay again and you'll see that although Austin and Cromartie came down with the ball at the same time, one of them distinctly had possession when they were in midair:


From that picture, it appears Cromartie has both hands and a good cradle on the football. Austin's hands are on the ball too, but they're on top of it and he couldn't have had much of a grip. This was Cromartie's ball to catch. Austin went and took it away.
There shouldn't be much shame in this. As any longtime reader of Shutdown Corner knows, and Antonio Cromartie just found out, it's impossible to out-muscle Miles. Somehow, I get the feeling this won't be a reasonable excuse in film study on Tuesday when Rex Ryan is chewing out his corner for getting beat out on a touchdown.

0 users disliked this comment Brainfry 7 minutes ago Report Abuse Personally, form what I can see in the photo above, is Antonio Cromartie has more of his body on the ball than Miles Austin does. Miles has 2 hands and a wrist on the ball. Antonio had, 2 hands, right arm and chest on the ball. Clearly Cromartie has possession of the ball base on contact of body.  

What if 2 players have recovered a fumble with both players possessing? Is the ruled the same? I noticed the rule was based solely on a pass.

4 users disliked this comment Louis 16 minutes ago Report Abuse they should have a "jump ball" rule like in Basketball when this happens and it should rotate just like in Basketball Jets CB had the ball and Austin put his hands on it like in basketball to cause the ruling. All this does is negate the old saying that the Defender has just as much right to the ball as the receiver; that had always been my understanding of the game-apparently not any more all a receiver has to do to stop ann interception is put his hands on the ball and come down at the same time as the CB asd the receiver gets credit....that is total @#$%

Fuel Distributor's Tank Is Full With More Than $1 Billion In Committed FinancingBy Zacks.com | Forbes – Tue, Aug 30, 2011

World Fuel Services sells marine, aviation and land fuel products to  clients at more than 6,000 locations in 200 countries. Customers include  airports, seaports, tanker truck loading terminals and other storage  locations.
A Record Second Quarter
On August 2, World Fuel Services reported its second quarter results and  easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 35%. Earnings per share were  78 cents compared to the consensus of 58 cents.
It continued an impressive earnings surprise streak that was extended to 13 straight quarters, going all the way back to 2008.
The aviation segment saw gross profit rise 55% to $82 million year over  year. The marine segment's gross profit rose 17% to $50.7 million while  the land segment saw an increase of 182% year over year to $32.4  million.
New Credit Facility
World Fuel Services also obtained a new $250 million 5-year term loan as  well as amended and restated its existing $800 million credit facility  while extending the maturity date to 2016. It now has $1.05 billion of committed financing.
Zacks Consensus Estimates Rise
Analysts like what they heard as the 2011 Zacks Consensus Estimate rose 5 cents to $2.53 per share.
While that is earnings growth of just 4.7% over 2010, analysts expect larger growth in 2012 with earnings expected to jump 13%.

Valuations Still Attractive

Shares have been choppy in 2011.

But they still trade at attractive valuations.
In addition to a P/E under 15, which I use as a cut-off for value  stocks, World Fuel Services also has a price-to-book of 2. A P/B under  3.0 usually indicates "value."
It also has a really low price-to-sales ratio of 0.1. Anything under 1.0 indicates a company is undervalued. Additionally, INT has a solid 1-year return on equity (ROE) of 15.6%.
World Fuel Services has figured out how to run a profitable business in  these market conditions. Shares remain attractively valued, as they are  squarely in the "value stock" category.
This Week's Value Zacks Rank Buy Stocks
The Timken Company (TKR - Snapshot Report)  reported a record second quarter as demand remained strong. This Zacks  #1 Rank (strong buy) also raised full year guidance as it expects record  sales and earnings in 2011. With the recent stock sell off, shares are  now dirt cheap at just 7.6x forward estimates. Read the full article.
Insight Enterprises (NSIT - Snapshot Report)  recently raised full year guidance as favorable market conditions  continued. This Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) trades at just 8.6x forward  estimates. Read the full article.
Boston Scientific (BSX - Analyst Report)  is seen as a turnaround story with a single digit stock price and a  forward P/E of 13. But this Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) recently  surprised on the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 7th quarter in a row  and raised full year guidance. Read the full article.
There are no signs (yet) of a recession from the transports. Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL - Snapshot Report)  reported a record second quarter as revenue soared in the double  digits. This Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) is a value stock with a forward  P/E of 13.6. Read the full article.

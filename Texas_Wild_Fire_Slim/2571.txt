You're in the tomato sauce aisle of your local ShopRite. You're in a rush, you still have 18 other things to buy, and you have to make it home by 4 to TiVo that episode of Most Eligible Dallas that you forgot to watch last week so you're all caught up in time for the new one tonight. You glance at the selection and are befuddled. (What's the difference between marinara and puttanesca again?) You're on the verge of a red sauce-induced nervous breakdown. But hope springs eternal. Bam! You see the trusted, smirking face of Emeril Lagasse on the third row from the top. You grab a jar of Emeril's Home Style Marinara ($3.88) and move on to the Greek yogurt section.
You have just made an understandable mistake.
That's because, according to a new Consumer Reports taste test of celebrity-branded food products, Emeril's Home Style Marinara is worse than Ragu's tomato sauce, but is significantly more expensive. It only rated "good" in the magazine's comprehensive survey of tomato sauces with celebrity imprimaturs. The magazine also tasted celebrity offerings of minestrone soups, tomato soups and salad dressings. 
Emeril's tomato sauce wasn't alone in its underperformance: just three of the 26 products tested got the magazine's top rating, "excellent." 10 managed to squeak by with a "very good." But the other half all got rating comparable to much cheaper products from major companies like Kraft and Unilever.
The very worst rating, a "fair," went to minestrone soup from the Pritikin line of foodstuffs geared towards weight loss.
None of the minestrone soups or salad dressings were said to be "excellent." The highest rated in those categories were, respectively, Wolfgang Puck, which got just a "good," and Rao's, which was called "very good."
That said, a few products did taste as excellent as their pedigrees promised. Consumer Reports called Wolfgang Puck's Tomato Basil Soup, which costs $3.50 a can, "A soup to sip and savor." And two tomato sauces from Italian Food Network stars were apparently great. Giada De Laurentiis' tomato basil sauce (a relative bargain at $3 a jar, but available only at Target) was praised for its "buttery richness." And big-living Mario Batali put out a "garlicky tomato-basil sauce" that won the taster's approval despite its $8 price tag. The Batali sauce sounds like something of an anomaly among the celebrity-branded products: is ingredients align perfectly with the marinara sauce recipe in the cookbook for Babbo, Batali's flagship Manhattan restaurant.

				It really is...
we have an abundance of roma tomatoes this year so I'll be freezing a ton of sauce. 
To be able to control the sodium is such a plus when making your own sauce and it tastes so much better than anything in a can or jar. 

I'm a lousy cook so if I can make great pasta sauce, anyone can :)

				Most processed pasta sauce tastes terrible.  Making it yourself doesn't take that much time to prepare and the results taste better and the quality of the product is better.  I wouldn't touch Ragu with a ten-foot pole.

				Not surprising­. Just read the ingredient­s of these processed foods (regardles­s of what label is slapped on it) -- heavy on sodium, sugars, dyes and many unpronounc­eable substances­. Just make your own stuff. It's easier than you think: just requires discipline­d planning. (Oh, that's right, many Americans struggle with that...and instant gratificat­ion.)

				I love Mario Batali!  I met him the night I got engaged...­. At his restaurant Babbo.  If you get a chance-  GO!  One of my favorite restaurant­s.  And moderately priced.  Mario was a real character.  Jovial,  boisterous­,  and a little buzzed.... when I chatted with him.  A lot of fun.  I've had his jarred sauce.  It's expensive for sauce,  But worth it if you need food in a hurry.  A little pasta and cheese and you're in business.

Lots of gristle & small pieces of bone. Some of these chefs slap their name on a product for the bucks only. Needly to say, we never were a repeat customer.

				There ought to be more. But the process is often as simple as a marketing company approachin­g them to sign on the line and hand over some recipes. By the time the product reaches the store shelf, the touch of the chef has been completely lost, and the product is produced no differentl­y from any other on the shelf, using the same low-cost bulk ingredient­s than the cheap brands.

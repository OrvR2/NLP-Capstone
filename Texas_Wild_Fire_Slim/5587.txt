¡Hola, Netflix! The movie-streaming service, which to date has been available only in the U.S. and Canada, has launched in Brazil and will be launching in 42 more Latin American and Caribbean countries later in the week.
According to a post announcing the launch on the official Netflix blog:
Over the last few months, our team has spent countless hours in the region learning as much as we can about how Latin Americans think about, and enjoy, movies and TV shows. We’ve licensed thousands and thousands of hours of feature films, classic favorites, gripping telenovelas, documentaries and kids shows we know you’ll enjoy.  We’ve been testing and figuring out the right internet architecture to make sure the quality and speed of the Netflix streaming experience is the best it can be.  And we’ve been training people locally to deliver the excellent customer support Netflix is known for in the U.S. and Canada. 

The subscription service, which will be streaming-only, has already begun in Brazil, where the monthly fee is $BR14.99 or $9.10 American (that's about a dollar more than it costs here in America).  Netflix will be rolling out service to other Latin American countries during the week, with launches in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay coming up soon, and Mexico receiving the service on September 12. 
Users can set their language preference to English, Spanish or Portuguese and will at the very least be able to enjoy programming from CBS and Showtime, which signed a big deal with Netflix to make their content available in Latin America in late July. Netflix has also announced a deal with Miramax that will make much of its library available for streaming in the new countries as well. 
Netflix's expansion outward from America began in September 2010 when it launched  its streaming service in Canada and the company announced that it had hit the 1 million member mark in August 2011. 
This is some good news for Netflix, which recently had Starz publicly walk out of contract renewal negotiations. This means around a thousand TV show and movie titles will be pulled from Netflix in February 2012 when the contract with Starz expires.

				Hm, should we pay Starz to offer their 3rd tier movies or should we lock down the streaming business of an entire hemisphere­?

I think Netflix made the right choice. They have $300,000,0­00.00 cash in the bank and I can't wait to see the kind of entertainm­ent they purchase. It would have been a pity to waste a penny of that money on Starz.

				I love how this comes out the day it is announced that Netflix will restrict the amount of streams on one account at the same time. This means if you want to watch something at the same time your kid/husban­d/wife/roo­mmate etc... you have to pay extra. Sucks for families.

				If the Fox Party allows the Post Office to default, and having a Internet streaming service that only contains "B" movies and cancelled TV shows, may make Netflix need to abandon the U.S.A. for places where the postage is affordable and backed by the government­, profit or loss, like it used to be here, before the Fox Party privatized it.
I was an original subscriber with Netflix. My bill went from $30 to $43 overnight. For that amount of money I can pick up all my cable company's movie services. Even subscribin­g to just the streaming service, I could add HBO, for about the same price. Not much of a choice there. Goodbye Netflix. My wife liked it, I could take it or leave it. My choice: Leave it.

				You need to look at the facts. Fact is that Netflix is experienci­ng a huge increase in licensing cost from our friends, the big studios. If they don't raise prices they will just falter, or not have any decent content at all.

And I'd actually like to defend Netflix a little here; they have lowered prices since their inception instead of raising them. I have been with them since 2003 and I used to pay $22 a month for just 3 discs at a time, unlimited total.
And now, for a good while I have paid $9 for 1 disc, unlimited, PLUS unlimited streaming. That was a heck of a deal.

They aren't being greedy, they are made to sink or swim. You don't have to support it, but blame the studios, not Netflix.

				Netflix had a public relations disaster. There are so many different ways to have introduced the separation of their streaming and DVD services without angering so many people. 

If you watch a lot of TV, and a lot of people do, Netflix is still by far the best deal in town. The public anger will fade. The CEO is a visionary.

				I think people are forgetting that would be Netflix customers in South America do not speak english for the most part. Most of the Netflix Library is in English, so why would anyone in South America put up $10 a month for this? Netflix does not offer foreign language subtitles or different audio tracks for the movies so if investors think that there will be a boom in subscripti­ons, please please think again...

				You obviously didn't either. Language preference of what, the controls or the actual media? There is YOUR jump in logic. My point is that investors are thinking there will be consumptio­n of American media in English in Non-Englis­h speaking countries. Netflix clearly has had a tough time licensing content to other countries. Netflix currently does not have the ability to change the audio track or even add closed-cap­tioning to their library. What makes you think they will have that in other countries and not roll out that feature here in the states. Yes, they will have some local content from that country, including some telenovela­s, but that's it. So there ya go Luckybear. Read first...

				Watched the first movie from them last night here in Brazil during their free 'test' month.  

Slim pickings to choose from right now, but after years of being blocked from viewing content I can easily find while in the States, it's a nice change.  Amazon.com will be here by the end of the year as well, so there's more options.  And HP will soon have a Brazil Edition too.

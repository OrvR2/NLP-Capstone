Momentum builds behind Amanda Knox appealBy Mike KrumboltzMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz | The Envoy – 10 hrs ago

Is the incarceration of Amanda Knox coming to an end?
The American college student and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were found guilty of murdering Meredith Kercher in 2007. Knox has long proclaimed her innocence. Now, after Knox and Sollecito have spent years in prison and turned up for countless court appearances, an Italian prosecutor says that both suspects are likely to be acquitted.
According to the U.K. Telegraph, "court appointed experts have criticised the way the original forensic investigation was carried out by police." Knox won a recent victory in court, when the prosecutors' request to conduct further examinations on DNA evidence was denied. Independent experts contend that some of the DNA evidence against Knox should not have been admitted as evidence.
This doesn't necessarily mean that Knox will be freed, but it does give the jailed 24-year-old hope. Her days behind bars may come to an end if judges see things her way in the appeal. Below, a brief history of the case that has kept millions transfixed for years.Click on image to view photos of Amanda KnoxAmanda Knox, the U.S. student convicted of killing her British flatmate Meredith Kercher in Italy on November 2007, …
The crime: Knox, Sollecito, and a third man, Rudy Guede, were accused and jailed for the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher. Kercher, who was from England, was stabbed to death in the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy. She was also sexually assaulted.
The rumors: After Kercher's body was discovered, rumors began to swirl that the crime was some sort of sexual act gone horribly wrong. Many in the media took to referring to Amanda as Foxy Knoxy. Some people, including Knox's parents, felt that this nickname painted Amanda as some sort of seductress and helped convict her.
The evidence: Much of the case hinged on DNA taken from a 12-inch knife found at the murder scene. Investigators found Kercher's DNA on the blade, and Knox's on the handle. A recent review found that much of that DNA was unreliable and may have been contaminated by sloppy police work. That's good news for Knox.
The frenzy: Ever since the murder was reported, Web searches have been incredibly high. Even now, four years later, online interest in Knox remains huge. Over the past 24 hours, searches on "amanda knox" and "amanda knox trial" have both roared to huge gains. Not surprisingly, "foxy knoxy pictures" are also popular.
What's next: The closing arguments on the appeal are set to start later this month, on Sept. 23. Perhaps shortly thereafter, there will be real closure for all involved.

The only thing I know for sure is that Amanda Knox is a fine looking member of the opposite sex.

The fact is Ms. Knox admitted she was in the house when the murder happened during her false accusation of her boss. She later said she was not in the house. Then when her boyfriend called the police, and they were searching the other roomates room for signs of a burgular , they asked to see the murdered roomates room. She insisted that the murdered roomate always locked her door when she wasn't there. Upon the arrival of the roomate that Ms. knox claimed to have been a victim of a robbery , that roomate demanded that the door be opened to the murdered roomates room. Saying that the roomate never locked her door. Why would you lie about where you were and what you were doing if you are innocent?

The evidence against her is pretty strong even without the DNA. She lied to the police several times. She also falsely accused her boss, a prominent citizen of the murder, which she explained in detail, until it was finally found out she lied and her boss had never met her roommate and had been at work all night. She also claimed she had been at her boyfriends home, the other defendant , all night, until phone records proved that to be a lie. A day after the murder her boyfriend called the police , telling them someone had broken into her other roommates room. But nothing was stolen he claimed. How would he know? This girl has been caught in lie after lie. The left wing media seems to be the only people who are defending this girl. Typical of the left to side with the guilty , especially when overwhelming facts are presented, and stand against the innocent victim. I'm sure this will help Europes opinion of the United States.

Online instruction and testing done by "High Speed Universities" can be as good or better than classroom, if done well. One of the things I do is create learning management sites using the Moodle content management system, and design and author courses for them.

I find it absolutely amazing that people with a combined IQ that is lower than a cow pie baking under the hot sun, refuse to accept the scientific facts and evidence and believe that someone is guilty based on statements that were coerced out of them by police. Of course they look like lies since she had no knowledge of any real facts to tell them! Science speaks for unbiased truth, ignorance just speaks.

I've watched this story since the VERY begining.  She was asked names of the possible suspects, BEFORE she thought she was a suspect.  At the time she wasn't at home, and when she arrived home quickly realized something was very wrong.  She had to break into her roomates room, only to find her roomate's body laying on the floor.  Amanda called the police to her home.  Amanda was convicted based on her Myspace account and the "lude" photo's she posted.  She was convicted because she went panty shopping after being forced out of her home with just the clothes on her back.  She was convicted because she was caught hugging her boyfriend outside of her house...I'm sorry, but if a murder happened in my home, while I wasn't there.  I'd have called the police.  I would give the police any suspect I could think of.  If I weren't allowed to return home, I'd go buy panties, and most assuradly, I'd be hugging the closest person to me just to find comfort from the trauma I had just witnessed.

this woman is innocent I see they have no proof she did anything they went on a witch hunt and had no compassion for these innocent people, or the murdered girl if they cared about it they would have got the rite people or person that was involved seems like maybe an unwanted admirer or boyfriend she dumped is most likely guilty of this terrible crime against the poor murdered Girl Meredith Kercher, who was her friend and room mate of course Amanda's DNA would be there she lived there what a bunch of dumb asses

The black guy raped and killed the victim - a white woman, DNA supports that his semen was inside her. As for Knox lying, Italy is not America, there is no "Miranda" rights, you don't get to remain silent. You will need to tell the police something to keep from getting your butt pounded. So that means there are two types of confessions: real ones from guilty people or made up ones from innocent people trying to keep from getting beat up. The DNA on the knife handle, even without cross contamination, only proves that at some point in time Knox used the knife, not that she killed anyone with it. The real killer likely wore gloves so his DNA won't be on it. Bottom line - black guy rapes and murders white girl and tries to create reasonable doubt as to his guilt by blaming others (sounds familiar, huh?).

Innocent people don't lie and try to incriminate other people.  She tried to frame her co-worker and she told several different stories while trying to hide her own involvement.  She and her rich boyfriend are guilty and deserve to stay in jail for the rest of their twisted lives.

Even before the DNA evidence was presented, her guilt was assumed because she lied during the investigation to frame an innocent guy.

I read her story in Marie Claire, which was from 2009. According to the article, Amanda and her boyfriend were not in the house when the crime happened. What irritated me the most was when the police arrested them because they were not supposed to eat pizza after their friend died; they should be mourning for Meredith's death. I feel terribly sorry for her, her family, as well as her boyfriend; apparently, the justice system in that Italian province is, as quoted from this news, "sloppy." It was also mentioned in that article that Rudy had a crush with Meredith but she won't reciprocate it, which is a possibility that Rudy could be the suspect. I'm mad at him for doing so, but what's worse is that he confessed to his crimes, but quickly retracted them. Maybe he was actually paid. I hope everyone gets the justice they deserve.

Panama police arrest 80 members of cocaine ringAP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011





PANAMA CITY (AP) — Authorities in Panama say they have broken up a major cocaine trafficking organization that moved drugs from Colombia to Panama and then north to Mexico and the United States.Panama's Drug Prosecutor Javier Caraballo says 80 Panamanians and Colombians were arrested Monday in simultaneous raids across the Central American country.Caraballo says the group moved at least 18 tons of cocaine in the last two years mainly through the Caribbean and was led by alleged Colombian drug trafficker Jorge Indalecio Marmolejo.Caraballo said Tuesday the group distributed cocaine from gangs linked to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.Drug gangs are increasingly using Central America to ship drugs and launder money.

Someday, someone will release batches of drugs tainted with something harmful with a very slow reaction time. Once druggies start dropping like flies it will be a wake-up call to these kids before they waste their lives away.

Arrest? C'mon! These are the clowns that murder women and children then poison our kids. They murder police, political officials, their dealer and collection networks and even their customers. Dig a mass grave, spend $50 on the bullets and show the drug cartels we mean business.   ...or is it simply too profitable for many politicians?

These are the Panana equivalents of the Tea Party who refused to pay their fair share of profits to the government.

We don't have the money or the means to build enough jails to house this massive population of druggies.  Think of another way.

I alread;y own land there. I can't wait to retire. Drugs are just the icing on the cake. They are so much cheaper there and the Panamanians haven't killed 40,000 people importing and distributing their dope. I hope Mexicans never learn about this oasis in the sea of Sh*t.

Drugs.  Take 80 drug dealers away and what do you got?.  80 new drug dealers.  More people die from alcoholism and drunk driving than all the other drugs combined.  It's a fact, look it up.  Just legalize it and tax it already.  35,000 violent drug cartel deaths in Mexico in the last 7 years.  Meth and LSD and other designer drugs should remain illegal 'cause it is made from chemicals.  Cocaine, heroine, pot and booze all comes from the good Earth.  Tobacco kills millions but Congress would never ban it.  Campaign funds.  Hipocrits.

panama has been a smuggler route since the 1970's. You could by coke at a Pharmacy with a prescription and the Panama red brand of weed was the tops and available every where.Ships coming and going to every country that has a sea port and a way to get a container on board.  Any place a cop makes $200 a month there will be trafficking and there the banks are wide open to deposit drug money. Noriega was in bed with the drug smugglers and when he was ousted the got a new boss.

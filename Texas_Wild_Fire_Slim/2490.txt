Police in Maryland are investigating the mysterious disappearance of a school teacher who vanished during a shopping trip Monday evening.
Alice Elizabeth Davis, a 55-year-old English teacher at Parkside High School in Salisbury, was last seen at about 6:30 p.m. on Labor Day. According to her husband, she left their Allen home to go shopping at a Walmart in nearby Fruitland, Md. 
When Davis failed to return home by 8 p.m. her husband contacted police and reported her missing. During a search of the shopping center property, investigators spotted Davis' blue Honda hatchback parked across the street in a Big Lots parking lot.
According to the Wicomico County Sheriff’s Office, the lead agency investigating the case, officers found no signs of a struggle in or around the vehicle. Investigators also reviewed video surveillance cameras at Walmart and Big Lots and found no evidence that Davis was at either store Monday.

When contacted by The Huffington Post this afternoon, Wicomico County Sheriff Mike Lewis declined to go into detail about the current status of the investigation. The sheriff said that a press conference would be held later this evening.
Speaking with The Delmarva Daily Times, Parkside High School Superintendent John Fredericksen said the school district is keeping Davis in their thoughts as law enforcement investigates her whereabouts.
"Mrs. Davis has been an important part of the Parkside High School family since 1983, and is a 1973 graduate of James M. Bennett High School, so we know that many in the community know her and join with us in hoping for her safe return," Fredericksen said.
Davis is described as a white female, 5' 9" tall, 175 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a yellow shirt with images of cats on the front, blue shorts and sandals. Anyone with information is asked to call the Wicomico County Sheriff's Office at 410-548-4891.

HOUSTON (KTRK) -- 
A grass fire near Bush Intercontinental Airport prompted some evacuations Sunday.

As of Monday morning, the blaze in the 20900 block of Burnam Wood Blvd. at E. Richey near FM 1960 was nearly out.  At least 75 to 100 acres burned.    Firefighters evacuated the Mansions at Turkey Creek apartments for several hours as a precaution. All those residents are now back home.  According to officials, an 18-wheeler started the fire when the center of its trailer gave in and dropped on the road. The brakes started scraping against the pavement and sparked the flames.    Firefighters have the blaze contained, but they are monitoring for any possible flare ups.     HPD still has an extensive area blocked off between FM 1960 east and Richey Road that leads all the way through to Aldine-Westfield.   There were no structures lost in the fire.  No injuries were reported.   Airport officials say the haze from the fire isn't affecting any airport travel as of this morning.

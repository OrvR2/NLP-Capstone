Zombie Tea Party Game Causes Outrage Amongst The Right
by Zara Golden | 1:54 pm, September 7th, 2011

Feeling like your world is being taken over by Tea Party Zombies? Why not use your lunch break to take a few of them out. The folks at StarvingEye have put together a very-much partisan game they call Tea Party Zombies Must Die, a game wherein — as you might guess — you are invited to kill a series of prominent Tea Party figures turned zombie.
The game’s pretty straightforward: the objective is to kill everyone around you, everyone around you being Fox News anchor and Michele Bachmann zombies. Just “DON’T GET TEA-BAGGED,” as per the game’s instructions. And so, armed with a crow bar, you are set out into a world otherwise abandoned to mow down Sarah Palin, Mike Huckabee, Sean Hannity and Koch brother zombies. It took me a while to beat my first Bachmann-zombie, but maybe you are better at video games than I am.
As New York Magazine’s Daily Intel points out, outrage was aplenty yesterday on right-leaning blogs. Breitbart’s BigHollywood had a more gentle “told-you-so” take, making reference to Bill Ayers and Jimmy Hoffa while saying, “We all know who fantasizes and encourages violence.” Powerline wondered if, with games like this, if it is possible “to tell where the respectable left ends and the cesspool  left begins; or, more accurately, whether a respectable left exists at  all.” PajamasMedia likened the game to Nazi propaganda.
The game seems to have hit on a nerve left raw from the weekend spent discussing Jimmy Hoffa’s call to union members to “take these sonsofbitches out.” Hoffa urged war against the Tea Party, and even though he was imagining an army of unionists waving ballots in the faces of Tea Partiers, the way he said it made it sound like he’d be just as happy to see them yielding crow bars like players in this game. Whereas it was once assumed that violent rhetoric was a conservative proclivity, used mostly by proud gun-totting, NRA approved Republicans, it’s starting to seem like its just an en vogue form of politic talk. If it’s a problem, it’s a nonpartisan one.
Tea Party Zombies Must Die makes game of this, combining violent image and political agenda in a way that has turned scary in the past. However, that this is a game while Sarah Palin’s video-game riffing chart was a political prerogative remains an important distinct; as Daily Intel’s Joe Coscarelli points out, as violent and distasteful as it might be, “at least the game was not signed off on by a professional politician.”
And, anyways if tea-party hunting is not to your thing, you might try SlapObama? The internet is big, and on it there is an offensive game to every taste. Tea Party Zombies is only as worrisome as the rest of it.

There should be a game called Tea Party Zombies vs. Left Wing Vampires. Moderate Mummies will just stand around and watch.

I give it a week before someone on the right rips off the game and does the exact same thing to promote their agenda 
aka who cares? Its a video game thats clearly politically motivated that just goes to show that people with ideology will do anything to promote them, and no it doesn’t matter which side of the fence your on. The only difference is how refined and effective the agenda is
EX: fox news is superior to MSNBC not because they are “fair and balanced” but because they do a better job of promoting their conservative agenda over MSNBC’s liberal agenda

Who really cares? Soon enough, there’s going to be a reality show where leftist hippies are getting blown away as they try to create a constitutional crisis during election season.

Wait, so the right’s message is that if Michele Bachman or any other Tea Party member were to turn into a flesh eating zombie we shouldn’t defend ourselves from them when they try to eat our brains?
That’s just downright unAmerican if you ask me.
This country was founded on the principle that if our fellow Americans turn into zombies and try to gorge themselves on our flesh then we, as Americans, have the right to use violent force to protect ourselves. 
Clearly the developers of this shoddy web based browser game are the real patriots here.

No, the target map did not turn scary. 
Why must people keep pushing that lie? The Palin target map, as used by DEMOCRATS as well, had NOTHING to do with the shooting in AZ, no matter how badly it seems people wanted it to.
http://www.verumserum.com/?p=13647
“at least the game was not signed off on by a professional politician” – yea…it’s just silly Liberals, so who cares?  Palin was actually advocating REAL VIOLENCE by using a map the DCCC uses, too! But, the Democrat version was fine! It’s just when Conservatives do it. 
Good thing they never made a movie depicting the assassination of President Bush….
(that slapobama game is offensive)

I find this lack of dismissal to be disturbing, yet I realize it fits with the obvious editorial agenda of the author. I find myself disgusted more and more at what you write, Zara.

I’m entirely liberal, but I actually am in complete agreement.  All the criticism of Palin’s target map was idiotic and really desperate.  I think alot of people just wanted a reason to criticize her and that was the most convenient issue of the day (which, again, is idiotic as there are lots of real reasons to criticize Palin, so you don’t need to reach for something so trivial).
And no.  The Slap Obama game isn’t offensive.  It’s just a harmless attempt at internet humor.  Sure it might not be funny or clever, but it’s not the outrage people are making it out to be, nor, for that matter, is this zombie game.
Personally, though, I don’t blame conservatives or liberals when it comes to these sorts of things.  I blame the stupidity of the media for allowing such trivial BS to become an issue in the first place.

Maybe someone can make a game where Mediaite staff is bludgeoned to death with crowbars. Start with the lower lever staff of Frances Martel “I’m cool with conservatives being attacked. I’ll report on it but I’ll make it seem like it’s a non issue or that the conservative deserved it” zombie, all the way up to Tommy Christopher “I hate conservatives so I’ll trash them any chance I get because I love Obama & will defend him to a point where my journalistic integrity is as dead as I am” zombie! I know I would sure love to play that! Who wouldn’t love a game where you can beat Mediaite staff “zombies” do death with a crowbar. I mean, they’re not human, right? It’s only a game, right Mediaite staff?
How very “The Eternal Jew”. http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6229070629122885245

The twisted, sick mental defectives of lunatic-left d-cRAT socialism are so full of hate and rage against anybody who doesn’t swallow their extremist BS they actually FANTASIZE and DREAM of inflicting harm and death on their opponents, in addition to calling for it openly. Compared to a d-cRAT socialist, casey anthony seems like another Mother Teresa.
The lunatic-left are vile, dangerous, sociopaths. Like the out-of-control drug addicts they so resemble, the lunatic-left d-cRAT socialists are likely to explode into uncontrollable fits of anger and violence against NORMAL, SANE, PATRIOTIC American citizens at any moment. They make their follow lunatics, the GOONS and THUGS of public-sector unions, look like tame pets in comparison. Since there is no known cue for the debilitating disorder of d-cRAT socialism, to minimize the damage to America it would be best if all the lunatic-left were rounded up and put into the states that the d-cRAT socialists control and hence are already morally, ethically, socially, politically and fiscally bankrupt, particularly the peoples republics of california, illinois, massachusetts and new york.  The d-cRAT socialists must be prevented from entering any responsible American state by strict border control.
Get mental help you lunatic-leftists – it’s probably covered under your beloved obozocare so responsible, hard-working, taxpaying American citizens will wind up footing the bill, and you know how much you enjoy it when that happens !!

I only meant that Palin is the only one that has a legitimate legal case, since her name and likeness are trademarked. Plus, it’ll cause normal Americans to be like “whoa, there are people that do that sort of thing”…and I think it’s important for that to be known, on both sides of the aisle.
Also, no need to use the retard. I was mad at Bristol for doing it and I will be mad at any other person for using that word.

You can actually say, you found Palins target map of people she wanted eliminated, as trivial? It’s time to give your head a shake on that one. If it was you that had the map and it was found by police, you’d probably be spending some time behind bars. 
You also find nothing offensive about a game titled slap Obama with the wording, slap that ni**er, slap that ni**er? I can only come to the conclusion that you might be somewhat racist.
I have no respect for Palin or her crazy Tea Party, nor do I have much respect for how Obama has handled things since being elected. I stay undecided as not one person has shown so far, they have the brains to be in charge.
I do however know where to draw the line. Assinine things like a kill a tea party member game, or slap Obama game, are offensive and over the top, & are usually created by people full of hatred. For you to equate both of these games as trivial BS, one can only think you’ve sunk to the same level.

If she was not, the map would not have been removed right after the news came out of GGiffords being shot in the head. Palin would have left the map as it was if she’d meant no harm. 
I find any map, target, words, shown or spoken towards others of a different party or race, in a derogatory or harmful way, offensive. If you don’t then you have no respect for mankind.

“You actually think she was calling for people to be murdered? Seriously? You actually think she was calling for these people to be *eliminated*?”
I don’t think that was her intention, but at the same time she needs to be smarter about such things because most tea baggers are armed and angry. She clearly enjoys using gun references to appeal to her base, and they clearly eat it up. It only takes one psycho to see something like that and act on it “for the good of his country.”

When “violent rhetoric” (battle allusions or gun symbolism) is used by conservatives in campaign mode, it’s not just dangerous to our national discourse, it’s a dangerous appeal to every insidious right wing murderous crank (which inundate the country…).
However, the sort of explicit violence and dehumanization characterized in this video game is headlined here as causing little more than the sturm und drang of partisan inspired hebejebes…

“Tea Party Zombies Must Die makes game of this, combining violent image and political agenda in a way that has turned scary
 in the past. However, that this is a game while Sarah Palin’s
video-game riffing chart was a political prerogative remains an
important distinct; as Daily Intel’s Joe Coscarelli points out, as violent and distasteful as it might be, “at least the game was not signed off on by a professional politician.” ”
That has got to be one of the most intellectually insulting bits of dissembling that I’ve seen in quite a while.
Bullseyes and scope sites have long been used as images denoting the targeting of a particular campaign.  In fact targeting can be seen here on this DLC map:
http://www.dlc.org/ndol_ci.cfm?contentid=253055&kaid=127&subid=171
The issues lies in whether or not such imagery is appropriate in our current more emotionally fraught climate.
THAT is arguable.  It’s debatable …as were the motivations behind the use of the imagery.
A video of this sort isn’t, and to minimize the significance of it by arguing that at least it wasn’t a campaign ad by a Democrat…, is nothing less than a craven deflection that abets what is the essence of political hate speech.

Those were the words. You may not like “Hoffa”, you may not like being wrong, you may even say he meant something different, but by fact, “it was edited’ and you say,… ‘grow up’!? What does anything in my post have to do with the “Boogy Man”? Conspiracy and ‘the sky is falling” is all “tea” all the way!

OK, I stand corrected. You’re not a bagger, just a right-wing dick. And you need to come up with funnier jokes. Telling a guy named juan to trim your hedges and then deliberately calling him “boy” right after is not funny, it’s tired, cowardly and hateful. At least try to be original.

As a member of the vast Right Wing Conspiracy, I find your post hard to read, as I lose interest when names are being called.
It shows a lack of content of an argument.

funny. I was trying to figure out the same thing.

Leo, what’s this prick, fraud,clown, hypocrites? In the words of your “Lord and Master “tone down the rhetoric”! Wait,… I forgot, that’s the “tea” double standard allowing the hate for the “right”, not the “left”! It’s ok to hate “Hoffa” that’s what you do and he’s not so clean. I said the same thing about the game, I didn’t like it. Do you even read the posts? You go off on a agreement. The tape was edited. I know you don’t like that, but it was. Listen to one sentence before, the “Fox” edit.

Sorry, it looked you were promoting it. I’ll edit the reply accordingly.

The resident liberal retards have nothing intelligent for a rebuttal. Color me not surprised.

So is taking a shit in your hand and eating it.

I saw a screen capture from the game inside the Fox news part of the game. There was a room with a “Blond Anchorwoman Breeding Pit” in it.  Regardless of what you think of the game you have to admit the idea of Fox having a Blond Anchorwoman Breeding Pit is pretty funny.

Oho, right wingers all of a sudden discovered political correctness. The names for the zombies are hilarious.
“Factory made Blonde Fox News Barbie who has never had a problem in her life zombie” hahaha

Do a Google image search on “surveyor symbol” and compare it to the map.
Or is actually finding out the facts beneath you?






Carltonconnie



Not exactly legal to take a shit in your hand and eat it in public,sir. A rediculous analogy.

Laugh it up, fuzzballs. You all know damn good and well that if this was a game depicting any of your left-wing liberal heroes, you’d be bitchin’ and moanin’ and groanin’ all over this site and a few others. The outcry would break the sound barrier. Not so here, though. Just shows your hypocrisy and inhumanity.
Time will tell…your turn may be next!
Think about it, comrades.

Well, I suggest you simply create a liberal zombie game, have the targets as top liberals Obama, Hillary Clinton, etc. and see what the reaction on the right is.  I suspect Zara’s point of view would remain the same, but we’ll see.
I personally think any ‘game’ to shoot potiicans in any form (zombie included) is too sick and morally wrong for my taste, but that’s me.  As long as its okay for alll parties and races, I’m fine with it.

oops,not ‘fine with it’, just not outraged. Only find it ‘just plain morally wrong’.

For someone who seems to spend every waking hour searching for anything political she can find fault with, then post the links on mediaite & her personal blog/s (big fail on your blog) for debate, one would think you knew, or at least now know, only a few select words of Hoffa’s comments/speech were pounced on by the media.  If you don’t know the full context by now, you’re more ignorant than I suspected you were. 
 You really should stick to your knitting & crocheting Sarah. At least with that, you get the odd postive comment.

I’m so not a conservative, at least on most issues. This thing makes me pretty angry too. Political violence is not something to play with.

“Whereas it was once assumed that violent rhetoric was a conservative
proclivity, used mostly by proud gun-totting, NRA approved Republicans,
it’s starting to seem like its just an en vogue form of politic talk. If
 it’s a problem, it’s a nonpartisan one.”
It was only “assumed” by fuck-for-brains such as Zara Golden. Maybe if you’d actually ventured out of the Progressive Propaganda bubble you live in and actually got some perspective for once in your life, this wouldn’t have been news to you.

Turns out the vile game creator works for an ad agency that does high-profile ads for Pepsi and others.  So, the boycott calls have begun, and ad week reports on what the PR nightmare might be.  The thing about conservatives is they are often the very people who advertisers target, and don’t really like being called names and games trying to shoot people they like.  Go figure…  Perhaps hating a groiup of people isn’t such a good thing… 
The word is getting out via conservative sites like Breitbart, which means it’ll probably be on Hannity…

Or is actually finding out the facts beneath you?

Boy, you dems and libs are really scared of the Tea Party.  It’s really quite funny to read your blogs.

Most Conservatives, like myself, see the childish Left as funny.  I may buy the game if it comes on the market.  I am also a game developer and, at the moment, working an a politial assassination game, which the player tries to sneak in and get a clear headshot at high ranking Leftist politicians, starting with the lowlife ones, like Waters, Rangel, Feinstein, then working higher to Pelosi, Reid, and finally, to Obama.  My grandkids enjoy the layout and are looking forward to playing it.  Shouldn’t be too hard ot market and shows how America feels about the Unqualified, NonAmerican Kenyan Usurper, B. Hussein Obama.  Oh, forgot to mention, in the game, Obama will be dressed in Muslim garb to honor his Islamic roots.

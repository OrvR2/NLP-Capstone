She has a stalker?  Vincent has wanted one for years.

yuck!  why are you stalking this wet blanket?  shes unbelievably un-appealing. You need to choose your stalking targets more reasonably.   Otherwise good on you and much success in your next project.

Any man would be furious if a complete stranger confronted his wife and hugged her.  It is never okay to put your hands on somebody without permission.  Add some creepy letters and a crazy look on a stalker's face and it's easy to see why Erbe was terrified.  Stalkers should be exposed, incarcerated and put on a permanent registry.  Stalking can be devastating because it's so difficult to prove in court due to weak laws.  If you don't believe me, go talk to a stalking victim and see just how "flattering" the experience actually is.

To all of you making snide remarks about Miss Erbe's looks you are either blind, drunk, stupid or jealous!  She is a beautiful woman.

autograph seeker. 1. That's what a fan is, generally, when it comes to celebrities. But 2. That's the kind of people who get accused of stalking celebrities, especially when the celebrites are private and paranoid.

No one wants to think someone is constantly watching you and sending you "creepy" messages.  Even you "anonymous"...

no one gets sentenced for stalking unless they show a competitive behavior of following and showing up where that actress is REPEATEDLY. they just neglected to tell you that part.

Sorry, but if all he did was compose "creepy" missives - why was she scared, and what the hell was he doing in court?

Pathetic.

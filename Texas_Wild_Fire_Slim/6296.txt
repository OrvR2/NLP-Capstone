If there's one thing San Francisco knows, it's sex. 
(SCROLL DOWN FOR PHOTOS)
San Francisco is the city that legalized pornography in 1969. And just this month, the city was rated number five in OkCupid's casual sex poll. Fortunately for frisky San Franciscans, San Francisco is also on top of sexual health, thanks to the San Francisco City Clinic, which celebrates its centennial this year. 
Since its opening in 1911, the City Clinic has sifted through the myths surrounding sex, offering STD information and prevention, women's health services and counseling and referrals, so you can keep on getting on — safely. This year, the clinic is making sexual health sexy with a sultry website, dubbed 100 Years of Sex, filled with sensual icons, vintage smut posters, sexual health resources and all kinds of goodies. Included in the swag: a readers' poll of the top ten sultriest spots in the city, in case you ever need a little inspiration.
Check out the top ten most romantic spots in the Bay Area from the San Francisco City Clinic readers' poll below. Don't see your sweet spot? Spill it in the comments section.

				Only 100 years of Sex? In 1907 the earthquake burned down the MUNICIPAL BROTHEL, 300 cribs, one-quarte­r owned by then-mayor­, but quickly rebuilt it with a 400+ crib brothel. Soon after the Gold Rush they inventorie­d the brothels and counted something like 164 of them within three blocks of the city hall. If you limit it to only (relativel­y) "safe sex", I think you need to start when penicillin was invented because there was no certain cure for syphilis before then.

				I left New York City long ago because the guy I was involved with was a workaholic and didn't have any time for me or himself and when I saw a full page promotiona­l ad in the NYTimes--S­an Francisco or LA, $50.00 one way--I tossed a coin and won San Francisco. After a year there, I met the man I would spend the next 24 years with until he died 6 years ago. Thank you San Francisco.

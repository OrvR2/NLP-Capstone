An unidentified 39-year-old Alaska Airlines passenger on an Anchorage to Seattle flight reportedly rushed the cockpit and bit a crew member once the plane landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport, supposedly anxious to de-board the plane.
Airport spokesman Perry Cooper told the Associated Press that passengers and crew had to subdue the man, who bit a crew member in the arm during the fight. 
The passenger was later taken to a local hospital for a mental health evaluation and was later taken to King County jail where he will be booked on investigation of felony assault, the Kansas City Star reports. 
In May, Rageit Almurisi, a 28-year-old man with a Yemeni passport, starting banging on the cockpit door of a San Francisco-bound American Airlines. A male flight attendant tackled Almurisi; passengers joined in subduing him. He was later charged with interfering with flight crew, which is a federal offense.

Cheney reveals his 'undisclosed location'By Rachel Rose HartmanPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Rachel Rose Hartman | The Upshot – Fri, Aug 26, 2011

(Threshold Editions/via AP)Following
 the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Vice President Dick Cheney disappeared 
and was whisked off to a "secure, undisclosed location" to protect his 
safety. But Cheney never confirmed where exactly he hunkered down.
That is, until now.
Cheney confirms in his new memoir, "In My Time," that some of the 
speculation was correct--one of his "undisclosed locations" was his 
residence in Northwest Washington, D.C., the Washington Post reports.
Which, in turn, means Joe Biden was right.
Vice President Biden told the world in 2009 that he discovered the 
bunker beneath his home during a tour of his new house. Biden revealed 
during the 2009 Gridiron Club dinner that the room was located "behind a
 massive steel door secured by an elaborate lock with a narrow 
connecting hallway lined with shelves filled with communications 
equipment," Newsweek's Eleanor Clift wrote at the time.
In
 the book, Cheney says that in addition to his D.C. home, the other 
undisclosed locations were at his home in Wyoming and at Camp David, the
 presidential retreat.
Cheney writes that he was surprised by the interest in the location, 
noting a "Saturday Night Live" skit that placed him in a cave in 
Afghanistan, according to the Post.
Cheney's memoir contains a cadre of additional tidbits. They include:
• After undergoing heart surgery in 2010, Cheney was unconscious for weeks, the New York Times reports.
 During that time, Cheney experienced a "prolonged, vivid dream that 
he was living in an Italian villa, pacing the stone paths to get 
coffee and newspapers," according to the Times.
• Cheney kept a secret, undisclosed resignation letter locked in a safe in case his health suddenly failed.
• He urged Bush to bomb a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor site in June 2007, but none of the president's other advisers agreed to the plan.
• Cheney offered to remove himself from the Republican ticket on three occasions before the 2004 election.Share your 9/11 memories with us on Twitter - #911remembered

Remember OPERATION NORTHWOODS... You have all forgotten, that is why the official explanation of 9/11 makes perfect sense to you. I dare you as a patriotic American to learn your own history and GOOGLE "Operation Northwoods".

All you dum-dum Cheney praising sheep... I have a cure for your mental illness.

Step 1: Google "Operation Northwoods"
Step 2: YouTube "Dick Cheney Norman Mineta"
Step 3: Put 1 and 2 together

Now you see your hero Dick Cheney for the murdering coward that he really is... I see that you still don't get it. DICK CHENEY KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HIT THE PENTAGON AND DID NOTHING TO SAVE THOSE LIVES. Hope he dies like a pig that he is (no offense to pigs).

Mr. Cheney, your "friends" are now blaming you for what happened. Defend yourself, don't let them make you feel guilty and depressed.  You need some one to help you to clear your name and set the record straight. 
Call this guy, Julian Assange, and tell him every thing you know. He will help you. 

Regards,

your devoted fan

Platano.

The truth about 9-11 has been totally whitewashed-there is so much glaring dirt, it is hard to gloss over, but fascist do it every day of the week and should be extremely ashamed of themselves,- since it makes them duplicit in the murder of 3000 innocent victims!

He locked himself in the White House bathroom and sat on the porcelain throne - his unofficial office, where else could he have come up with all the crap he did?

J. Michael Springmann, formerly chief of the visa section at the U.S. Embassy in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, explained in various interviews with European and Canadian media, that he rejected hundreds of suspicious visa applications in the late 90s, but the C.I.A. officers overruled him and ordered the visas to be issued. Springmann protested to the State Department, the Office of Diplomatic Security, the F.B.I., the Justice Department and congressional committees, but was told to shut up. Springmann observed that 15 of the 19 people who allegedly flew airplanes into buildings in the United States got their visas from the same CIA-dominated consulate in Jeddah.

Notice on a thread about Republican Dick Cheney that Republicans defend Him by cutting up, blaming, and ridiculing liberals and Democrats. They kind of try to forget the Bush and Cheney were in power eight of the eleven last years, and that every problem this Country has started before the last three years. Six of the last nine Presidents were Republicans. They forget How many Speakers of the House in the last thirty years were Republicans. They try to rewrite History, Historic facts, and undisputable truths, in order to blame the other side for what their guys did. The Republicans deregulated the Banks so they could cause the crisis that put people out of work, depressed the Housing Market, lost people life savings, and caused the Recession. Yet they blame Obama for not fixing everything, and running up the debts they caused.

I love the way he shakes the trees and all the liberal monkeys and conspiracy theories come out from under the rocks.   Too funny.  I love all the lies and garbage spewed by the idiots that think Cheney was the devil or worse.

this is a huge lie. Norman Mineta was with cheney and alot of other people that day when cheney told mineta that the orders were not to intercept the planes but to stand down, THIS IS FACT.

it took the Bush administration 411 days to form a commison to investigate 911- why ? Because they knew they were the ones who ordered it. How come the US is not intested in saving the Somolis - becuase they dont have the oil that Iraq does. The US govenment does not speak the will of the people of the United States ... the government lied - just like when kennedy was assasinated by a CIA agent Oswald and company ( E Howard Hunt - the big event- watch Jessie Ventura....

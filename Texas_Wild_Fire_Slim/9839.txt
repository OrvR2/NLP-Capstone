SIMI VALLEY, CA. -- Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman's aides were ecstatic in the spin room after the debate, and they had reason to be: Their man turned in an appealing, level-headed, shrewd and well-informed performance. Whether it will make any difference is doubtful, but as a piece of stagecraft and appeal, Jon Huntsman's presentation of himself was spot on.
He may simply be too reasonable to be nominated -- or even to get much traction.
"He was the best he's ever been and he's getting better all the time," his top aide, Jon Weaver, told HuffPost minutes after the debate ended.
In the first debate that included Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Huntsman unveiled a clever appeal: that he has both the private-sector knowledge of Mitt Romney and the tax-cutting and job-creation track record of Perry.
He noted that Utah was number one nationally in job creation during his tenure and that he repeatedly cut taxes in his state.
He defended the science of climate change and evolution without directly accusing anyone else on the stage -- notably Perry, who has questioned both -- of being on the other, unpalatable side of the argument.
And he repeatedly brought the talk back to big themes: poverty and world affairs and a sense that America had lost its "core."
Huntsman continues to trail badly in the polls. He refuses to take various pledges. He can get establishment voters if Mitt Romney falters. But if Tea Party types take the time to look at his economic track record, they'd like what they'd see. With personal money in the billions and more competitiveness than meets the eye, Huntsman could be in it for the long haul, despite his miniscule standing in the polls.
He's clearly learning how this system works, and he looked more comfortable -- and was a bigger presence -- on this stage than he has been before.
With Perry going for the Tea Party (and Bachmann looking confused and fading fast), and with the others essentially non-factors -- Huntsman has reason to stick around.
Moreso after tonight.

				Huntsman is the only R candidate of respectabl­e substance.  It is not puzzling why the reactionar­ies do not like him, though.  He's no reactionar­y.  That vein of 'political­' fervor runs thicker than blood, and twice as valuable to the true believers.

Huntsman is the only candidate Obama has to fear, except for Obama.  Obama has lectured the Democratic Party more than once about its historical love affair with shooting itself in the foot.  Now he seems incapable of doing anything else with any major issue.

It is simultaneo­usly unbelievab­le and predictabl­e that he is proposing a "jobs" bill that will be little more than momentary window dressing for the TV eye & tabloids & cyber talkers.  And that window dressing will have less appeal in Congress than Ryan's & the Republican­s' various proposals to kill Social Security and the other social safety nets have had with voters who remember (unlike our congresses­) that we've spent eight decades putting those safety nets into place, and paying for them.

It remains to be seen if our public memory (we know Congress and the White House's occupants have no memory - that's for sore losers in their view) will remember we paid for these things and also remember that the public debt problem is almost entirely due to flagrant military adventuris­m abroad over the last three decades combined with the licentious irresponsi­bility of Wall Street over the same period.

				Yes we paid for the safety net. And both perties spent the money. Now we have a $104 trillion unfunded program in Social Security alone. Perry is right that it is a Ponzi game as it is now. I am 54 and there is no way I will get what has been propmised to me.... And what I paid for.....

				I thought Huntsman looked great as well but I feel like he is running at the wrong time. I may take a look at him in 2016 but now. That would turn the country over to the republican­s and I am not willing to vote for that. We criticize, criticize, and criticize so more but it has to govern in these and being a politico is even worse. Huntsman would be an option but regardless of his positions, he still would have to deal with a republican controlled House of Representa­tives. Look at republican actions in some of these states. Can you imagine the entire country?? I am not voting for that!

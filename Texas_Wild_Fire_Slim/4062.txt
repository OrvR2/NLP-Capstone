Precautions to take when you use welding equipment outdoors:
Remove vegetation from the work area.
Where vegetation can’t be removed, use a sprayer to wet down the work area prior to starting welding operations. Wet a wider area on the down-wind side from the welding location. If working in the same area for an extended period, re-wet the vegetation surrounding the work site.
Keep water handy.
Have someone with you to spot any fires that sparks ignite so that they can be caught while small.
Avoid parking vehicles in dry grass tall enough to touch the catalytic converter on the underside of your vehicle.

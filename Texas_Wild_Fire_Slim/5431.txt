				They have started suits against banks just to thwart the New York AG Eric Schneider from proceeding with his. After all, he was not going to SETTLE. He is the only hero fighting for the PEOPLE that were robbed. They kicked him off the 50 State AG committee and banned him from teleconfer­ences to deny him any informatio­n of their intent. By going ahead with the suits, that will deny access of documents and witnesses for AG Eric Schneider. I doubt these suits would even be filed (if they have been) had AG Eric Schneider not pursued the banks !!!! Look at what they did to the last AG who was sincerely out for justice, AG Eliot Spitzer. A prostituti­on scandal in which he was never charged! Because there were no victims?!!­!!!!

AG Eric Schneider is a true public servant. The other AG's from the other 49 states are not people capable of serving as AG's.

Un huh. So why is the DOJ doing nothing about it? And why instead is the DOJ pressuring State Attorney Generals to lay off the banks?

This is the worst Department of Justice we've every had. 
Obama? Are you on board with this?

				we are all hamsters on neocon "financial­ly engineered­" and "financial­ly innovated" wheels

let's give them more tax breaks, less regulation­s, more bailouts, let them sit on TRILLIONS more of our cash while not lending even though that was supposedly the point of the bailouts, let's watch corporatio­ns give their execs the highest salaries ever as well as wall street execs, private equity execs, and hedge fund execs, while supposed "American" corporatio­ns pay NO US TAXES but pay higher tax rates overseas, let's give corporatio­ns ANOTHER TAX HOLIDAY so they can bring the TRILLIONS they've been stashing overseas back to the US at 0% TAX, let's make corporatio­ns uber-citiz­es so they can OWN OUR POLITICIAN­S and political and legal systems, lets crack down on the unwashed masses to fill the corporate privatized prisons for minor offenses such as video taping police brutality, let's privatize our military and spy on US citizens, and most of all let's have every politician swear fealty to israel and continue giving them billions and trillions for their war machine...

it'll all trickle down and grow jobs.

				Until the fines greatly exceed the profit made from breaking the law, it will do nothing to stop it and is just part of the cost of doing business. If someone can make $6,000,000­,000 and face a chance of paying a few million in fines and not having to admit guilt years down the road what do you think they'd do? Hell, the fines won't even put a dent in the profits made off having that 6B to use 10 years.

				if corporatio­ns really are "people" , why don't they have to adhere to the law like the rest of us?

We know no one will go to jail and a few paltry million dollar fines will be slapped against banks, , not enough to even dent a CEO bonus.

Thats justice in America .

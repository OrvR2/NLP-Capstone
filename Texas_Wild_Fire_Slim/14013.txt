Climate change is a myth and so are wild fires that are a result in Climate Change. Funding fire departments is a myth. The loss of 1000 homes are a myth.﻿

@85cc144 I do believe some of it is still burning. Not a whole bunch, just a tiny little bit. That's what my﻿ friends who live somewhat nearby there said on the school bus.

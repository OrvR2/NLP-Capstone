  September is National Preparedness Month led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Ready Campaign in partnership with Citizen Corp. The goal is to increase public awareness about the importance of preparing for emergencies, including natural disasters and potential terrorist attacks, at home, work and school. Events and activities across the nation encourage individuals to get an emergency supply kit, make a family emergency plan, and get involved in preparing their communities. National Preparedness Month is sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Ready Campaign. Check out events in your area at the NPM website.

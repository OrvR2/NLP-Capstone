In age where information travels at breakneck speed, it's no surprise the average news story has a short shelf-life. But many of us may be astonished to learn that the news cycle is a mere 24 seconds long--at least, according to a fictional study in the Onion article "Media Landscape Redefined By 24-Second News Cycle."
"Last week, after a reported 65 million Americans learned of the bipartisan immigration bill with the breaking news report 'Mexicans Stay,' it became apparent that the much- ballyhooed 24-second news cycle had come into its own," began the satirical story, taking a stab at the decreasingly informative information disseminated in the media's coverage of breaking news.
Take this week for example: no sooner had Steve Jobs announced his resignation as Apple CEO than an earthquake erupted in Washington, David Letterman received a death threat, and reports of possible devastation from Hurricane Irene spurred North-easterners into evacuation mode. In the meantime, Gaddafi's reign in Libya began to topple as rebels wore down his support.
Keeping track of everything that happened this week hasn't been easy, but luckily the folks over at Someecards have their finger on the pulse, putting their own hilarious twists on stories that you can easily send off to friends and family. As usual we picked our favorites from this week, so send away!

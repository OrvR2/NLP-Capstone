Israel isolated ahead of UN vote on PalestiniansBy JOSEF FEDERMAN - Associated Press | AP – 15 hrs ago

JERUSALEM (AP) — Rising tensions with some of its closest and most important allies have left Israel increasingly isolated ahead of a momentous vote on Palestinian independence at the United Nations.Troubles with Turkey, Egypt and even the U.S. are adding to Israel's headaches ahead of the vote, which is shaping up to be a global expression of discontent against the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The Palestinians plan to ask the United Nations this month to recognize their independence in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem — areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war — probably by embracing them as a "nonmember observer state." The measure is expected to pass overwhelmingly in the U.N. General Assembly.The assembly's decisions are not legally binding, so the vote will be largely symbolic. But the Palestinians hope the measure will increase the already considerable pressure on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories, and add leverage should peace talks resume. The Palestinians refuse to negotiate while Israel continues to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.Ghassan Khatib, a spokesman for the Palestinian government in the West Bank, said Israeli isolation is playing right into Palestinian hands. "We are seeing that result in increased support for us in the United Nations," he said.On Wednesday, China announced it would support the Palestinian bid. And a French Mideast envoy, Valerie Hoffenberg, said she had been fired after publicly arguing against the Palestinian initiative. France has not publicly said how it will vote, but her comments signaled that the government favors the Palestinians.The vote is seen by many not only as a message of sympathy with the Palestinians, but also a barometer of discontent with Israel's settlement policies. Some 500,000 Israelis now live in territories claimed by the Palestinians."There's no question that had Israel been seen as a country doing its utmost to promote peace, no such vote would be taking place," said Yossi Beilin, Israel's former deputy foreign minister.Beilin cited Netanyahu's refusal to extend a freeze on new settlement construction a year ago as the "mother of all sins" that put him at odds with the international community. The decision, made over the very public objections of President Barack Obama, caused a brief round of peace talks to collapse.Since then, relations with Obama have been further strained. In May, Netanyahu paid a tense visit to Washington, where he objected before cameras to Obama's call that the 1967 boundaries be the basis of a future agreement with the Palestinians. American officials privately express deep frustration with Netanyahu.Even so, Washington has been trying to pressure the Palestinians to give up the U.N. bid, saying peace can only be achieved through negotiations.Closer to home, Israel has watched Egypt, perhaps its most critical regional ally, cool relations since the ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak in February. Mubarak was seen by many of his people as too sympathetic to Israel, negotiating an unpopular deal to supply it with natural gas, for example.Israel-Egypt relations took a hit last month when five Egyptian police were killed during a firefight between Israeli forces and fleeing militants. Egypt was outraged, and mass demonstrations against Israel erupted in Cairo. Israel later apologized. But there have been calls in Egypt to cancel the 30-year-old peace agreement with Israel — which is an absolutely critical element of Israel's regional strategy.Another key regional ally, Turkey, has greatly curbed diplomatic and trade ties with Israel following Israel's deadly raid on a protest flotilla that tried to breach the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip last year. Nine Turks, one of them an American citizen, were killed in clashes with Israeli naval commandos.Israeli officials have tried to play down the tensions, saying that Israel has long faced hostility on the diplomatic stage. They also say that Israel has enjoyed some key victories recently, such as last week's U.N. report on the flotilla incident that defended its blockade of Gaza. Yet one official acknowledged the "new challenges" are a source of concern. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing sensitive internal discussions.Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the U.N. who is close to Netanyahu, said it is "a mistake to judge Israel's international standing by recent events."He said Turkey's animosity toward Israel is part of a broader shift by the country's Islamist government that "is troubling not just for the Jewish state but for many of Turkey's neighbors."And any anti-Israel resolution at the U.N. passes automatically, thanks to the dominance by developing nations that are sympathetic to the Palestinians, he said. "It's conventional wisdom that if there was a resolution whose first clause was anti-Israel and whose second clause was that the earth was flat, it would pass," Gold said.Israeli opposition leader Tzipi Livni, however, accused Netanyahu of weakening the nation's interests. "Israel's isolation is affecting its security and its economy," she told a conference Wednesday.

Turkey to Jews: JUDEN RAUS!

Jesus to the Jews: You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.

Muslims to the Jews: *&^%!?

Seems like no one can tolerate these parasites. In the mean time jews are so arrogant they think it will all blow over and they can bomb, commit piracy and kill who they wish

@Bam and R/C  You continue to stoop to the lowest levels with your personal attacks. That's why most civilized ignore all of your pro palestinian agenda. Your un-civlity is only hurting your cause. Many more than you imagine support Israel.

If we the US had any other "President" do you think Turkey would be doing this to Israel?  No they wouldn't.  I say the following that although I abhore this "President" I believe every word of what I'm about to say to be 100% true.

Barack Hussein Obama (BHO) is the antichrist.  In Rev 17 the US/BHO tie was foretold in the prophetic word picture that the Apostle John saw in his vision of a "harlot sitting on a scarlet colored beast."  The harlot depicted in Rev chapters 17 & 18 is the world super power nation in the last days which is the US.  The scarlet beast is the antichrist, her leader, who comes to power first through this world super power nation before gaining even greater power from 10 Islamic kings, which we will see happen from the vacuum created in the “Arab Spring”.  These 10 Islamic kings will “agree to give him their power to rule” (Rev. 17:12,17).  

There will be a "peace deal" between Israel and the antichrist which, when signed, will start the 7 year tribulation according to Dan 9:27.  This is the Israeli/Palestinian “peace deal” which will divide Israel’s land including East Jerusalem and give this land to the Muslims, and in exchange the antichrist will guarantee Israel’s security.  BHO has been pushing for this “peace deal” for quite some time now, especially in some of his recent speeches.  The Bible directly warns that the antichrist will betray Israel and break the peace deal 3.5 years after it is signed, which will be the midway point of the 7 year tribulation.

The Bible also warns that a False Prophet is coming, who is a separate person from the antichrist BHO.  This false prophet will be the Islamic false returned Jesus (called Isa in Arabic) whom Muslims are expecting very soon.  When he comes, this false (imposter) Jesus will deny he is the Son of God and deny he died on the cross.  He will also force everyone to take the mark of the beast so that no one can buy or sell, or function in society without this mark (Rev 13:11-17; Rev 19:20).

Wouldn’t the US stop a revived caliphate from becoming so powerful?  The answer is explained in Rev. 17:16-18.  After the antichrist BHO gains power over this 10 nation Islamic confederacy (after these 10 Islamic kings give him their power to rule) the US is destroyed shortly thereafter.  This destruction of the US is also depicted throughout the entire chapter of Rev. 18.  Hence, the US will not be in any position to oppose the revived caliphate.

Near the end of the 7 year tribulation there will be what the Bible calls the “War of Armageddon.”  This happens after the true Savior Jesus Christ returns to the Jews as their King.  Once this happens, the antichrist & the false prophet will gather their armies to march against Him in battle.  The revived Islamic Caliphate, lead by BHO and the false prophet, along with all the nations of the world that are allied with them, will be deceived and believe the true Jesus Christ King of the Jews is an imposter whom they call the “Dijjal.”  They will lead their Armies in an all out attack on Israel in an attempt to wipe Israel off the map and to kill the King of the Jews (the true Jesus Christ), but they will be completely and utterly defeated by Him (Rev. 19:19-21), and cast into hell for all eternity according to the Scriptures.

By the way, everyone needs to accept Jesus now because the time is short--the Jesus of the Bible who is the Son of God and who died on the cross.  This Jesus will give eternal life to everyone who believes in Him, who believes He is the Son of God, was raised from the dead, and that He died for your sins, and that salvation is only through Him and nothing or no one else.  He will come back to reign as King of the Jews very soon.  The Bible is clear that the world will fight against Him when He returns (Rev 19).  It’s time for people to choose sides.  Please choose wisely.  God bless you.

Hopefully this is the start of a boycott against Israel in the same way apartheid was eliminated in S. Africa.  If the Pals are smart, they will seize this opportunity and step up peaceful protests and cut the violence out completely to pull in some western support.

Israel? Isolated by the UN? Wow. THAT's never happened before.
I say: give the palestinians their state. And, then, Israel can treat attacks as attacks by one sovereign state on another and react accordingly.
If the palestinians don't starve first, of course, since they're basically in no shape to run an independent nation.

I know sooner or later the Palestinians will take back thier land that has been stolen from them by the Zionist Joos.  The Zionist Joos have alienated all of its friends and rightfully so.  They are a disgrace to humankind for thier treatment of Palestinians, they have been plotting to take Palestine since 1920 or so many more years than most people are aware of.  They have been ilegally smuggling people into Palestine for over 100 years and deserve to have the ;land taken back by Palestine.  These Zionist Joos think no one can read history or will not take the time, thier days are numbered, the world is tired of Greedy, Evil, Murdering Zionist Joos.  This does not apply to all Joos, but to most of them.  They are a very Evil, Greedy, Predatory people as is being demonstrated by people like Made-off, Murdoch, Greenberg, the Wall Street gang , the Bankers of America and Great Britain and many other examples to numerous to mention, almost all of the major finincial fiascoes in the world have Zionist Joos behind them, they speak for themselves.  Ever since the Zionist Joos lobbied the Romans to Kill Jesus Christ for them they have never had a day of peace, thier Evil ways were exposed to the world and the world has not forgotten and they have not stopped thier evil ways instead they have become more brazen and out of control.  The Zionist Joos need to be dealt with and the guilty held responsible and punished.

In the words of that great zionist statesman :' I so late , oy vey, I missed the boat'!

Mean spirited miscreants couldn't bother to apologize for 'accidently' shooting 9 unarmed activists in the back of the head....and have done everything to thwart the Palestinians in their bid for self determination....but everything is just great!
One day everything will be fine in Palestine.

Israel's fate does not lie in a UN vote, but in the hands of a God that is large and in charge.  According to the Book of Revelations, Jesus will ascend the throne in Jerusalem and lead the world from there, with all nations sending delegates (physically) to worship Him there. And so Israel will finally be recognized as The Promised Land of The Chosen People.

Hello to all dear readers. The Plain truth that Israel is the root cause of all the problems in the Middle east. Israel did not exist before 1948 i hope this will make you think that israel exist legally in palestine and the palestanians are the legal owner of the country including, palistianans jews, christians and muslims. The problem is the west support occupation and what made this stay for so long is the corrupted dictator in the Middle East .. ... Now the picture has changed on the ground in the middle East all the leaders in the arab world would be forced to take stronger stance against Israel by their people. Bottom line Arabs are not happy with the existence of Israel and they feel ashame and no dignity that their arabs brother in palestine and suffering. My best advice for the peaceful jews in Israel if you are really smart you should considering moving to a different country before its too late. I think the arabs will rise again and become a super power and liberate palestine. The arabs currently lack unity if they are united no one can defeat except themselves and greed. my jewish friends look the strongest country the usa can not win afghnistan against a few militants let alone when all arabs unite to liberate their arabic land in palestine ... so take your money and move to any country in the world. Arab jews are welcome to go back to their arab land and European jews are welcome to go back to Europe and american jews are welcome to come back to american and so on ... the problem would be solve and they will be peace in the middle east if you listen to my humble advice.

NBC's Andrea Mitchell announced on air Wednesday that she has breast cancer.
Mitchell, who has been with NBC for decades and serves as its chief foreign affairs correspondent and host of "Andrea Mitchell Reports" on MSNBC, made the announcement at the end of her show. She is 64 years old.
"I had planned to be hiking in Wyoming last week but instead discovered that I am now among the one in eight women — incredibly, one in eight — who’ve had breast cancer," she said. "Mine was discovered during my annual screening just a short time ago. Lucky for me, I’m one of the fortunate ones. We discovered it in the earliest stage, it has not spread, and I’m already back at work with a terrific prognosis."
Mitchell said that breast cancer awareness and prevention has always been important to her.
"I’m looking at this as another of life’s lessons," she said. "For you women out there and for the men who love you, screening matters. Do it."
Other NBC journalists tweeted messages of support to Mitchell. "Bravo Andrea," the "Today" show's Savannah Guthrie wrote. "You are most adored."

				Prayers and Light are sent to you, Andrea. It is a wonderful thing you did, bringing this very private moment to women and men who may forget to follow up for screenings­. Breast cancer happens to both men and women. It is good to be reminded to follow through and don't be lazy about this very important issue. God bless and keep you!!

				My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 66 in 1994 and after a mastectomy and 5 years of meds, she has been cancer free now for 17 years. A breast cancer diagnosis is not a death sentence and when detected early a person has every chance of a positive prognosis. Glad Andrea is going to be ok.

				Thank you Andrea Mitchell for going public.  I remember when my mother was called a 'cripple'.  I only wish that every American woman could receive the same kind of first rate care that she will receive.

We need another voice and thankfully we will have Andrea Mitchell.

Be well Godspeed.

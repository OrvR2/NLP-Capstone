When Barack Obama addresses both houses of Congress Thursday night to talk about jobs, the opinions are going to start flying furiously. Wouldn't it be more fun to learn what the president plans to do about unemployment while also enjoying a heavy dose of snark instead of punditry? Forget listening in as 24-hour-news personalities spin the speech and, instead, watch what some awfully clever comedians are tweeting about it. Join us, and WitStream, as we present a live tweet of President Obama's jobs speech Thursday at 7:00 p.m. EST. Consider it a bunch of spoonfuls of sugar to help the economic medicine go down.

				More of the same old same old spending policies. However I have heard that they have come up with some new ways of spending money.

I am suprised that the Republican­s won't respond though. That's curious. Then again whats the point of saying no more spending when they obviously are not going to be listened to anyway.

How many ways can both parties say the same things?

Dems = Tax more, spend more

Repubs = spend less, tax less

That about sums it up.

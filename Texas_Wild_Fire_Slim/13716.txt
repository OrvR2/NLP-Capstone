Are Your Rich Media and Traditional Marketing Efforts Making Your Competition Rich?

Posted on September 6, 2011 by Paul Robinson 


So often when evaluating the importance of your online marketing campaign (and related spend) very few marketers correlate how excellent or, conversely,  lackluster online effort impacts the ROI of other marketing channels and ultimately the bottom line.  If you run a diverse marketing portfolio you very likely could be wasting a large portion of your marketing budget and, even worse, funding your competition’s bottom line.
Here’s how:  In today’s saturated world of marketing, there is no argument that the era of “own one channel, dominate one channel” engagement models are gone.  Prospects–both B2B and B2C–increasingly engage your product or brand through a multi-channel approach. Your prospect may learn about you from a print ad, or through rich media, do research about your company or product online, subscribe to an email, be re-targeted and ultimately purchase through any variety of these, or other, engagement portals.  So this is a good thing right?  Hold on, not so fast.
Let’s use your print media campaign as a test case and let’s say, for example, your company invests multiple thousands (or even hundreds of thousands) in a brilliant series of print ads proclaiming the virtues, benefits and competitive advantages of your product or service as well as (of course) your brand. And, let’s say the online marketing efforts to date have done a poor job ranking online for your product, service description key terms or search practical  (highest search volume, highest relevance and most easily won) terms.  Most consumers and business people increasingly engage via product, not brand terms so, extrapolating, most engagement memory is around your product NOT your brand.
Let’s harken back to our conversation; you’ve done a brilliant job with your print media (both brand and product), however, your prospect is most likely going to remember your product, not your brand. Enter the multichannel engagement factor and voila, your prospect begins their research phase based on your product , NOT your brand. IF your online marketing effort is weak and does not rank well for the product/service search, guess who’s does?  You are so correct–your competitor–AND they have greater perceived relevance and presence that warrants your prospect to at least take a look, which could be the ultimate kiss of death. In the end you may not lose the sale or the client, but why open yourself up to that risk?

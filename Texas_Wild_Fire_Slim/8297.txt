Brazil conviction upheld in nun's killingAP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011





SAO PAULO (AP) — The conviction of an Amazon rancher for ordering the killing of an American nun and rain forest activist was upheld by a state court on Tuesday.A court in Para state ruled that Regivaldo Galvao must serve his 30-year sentence, though he can still appeal that ruling.Galvao turned himself into police a few hours after the ruling, his lawyer, Janio Siqueira, told the Globo news website.A jury last year found Galvao guilty of ordering the 2005 shooting death of Dorothy Stang. But he was quickly freed on appeal.Stang worked for three decades to preserve the rain forest and defend poor settlers' land rights.Prosecutors said Galvao and another rancher ordered her killing because she was blocking them from illegally obtaining a parcel of land.

he killed a woman.No difference because she was a nun,there is no god,I have no idea why religious people are supposed to get breaks.
Anyway he is still guilty of murder and should pay the price.

Look!! I went to Catholick Skrools for my entire life. I was tortured endlessly by lesbo Dyke Nuns. So this guy killed one worthless American homo nun. Who actually cares. Take every time for over 12 years that these freak dyke women beat me to a pulp and severly chastized me for any minor offense like feeling up a gals leg of chewing gum in class. Add their atrocities against me and many more people like me and the death of a single Amerfreakan Nun, who was interfering in the internal politics of the soverign nation of Brazil and I say "we have been blessed by the lord". That nun was probably on a mission from the Fatican to find little boys who could be "exported" to fag centers in Europe and turned over to Priests, for fun and profit by the degenerate Catholick church. I'm glad that she was wasted. The world is a better place without nuns, priests, popes, bishops, cardinals, etc.... This guy should get a medal of honor, not a prison term. Nuns don't belong in the Amazon jungle, they belong in the urban jungles of the world where they can find more victims to torture and more little boys to expropriate to the Fatican for fun and games.

In Brazil it is headlines , here this story would be buried on the last page of our liberal news paper because it involved a nun.

I also have a degree in Political Science, along with my numerous medical degrees. Do any of you sheeple know that 88% of Catholicks vote DumbaKrap?

Brazil is a corrupt country, a country where money buys anything, and its justice system is broke, I doubt it that this guy will remain in jail for long, what a shame!

Greed truly brings out the worst in humans.  May they rest in peace and may this rancher rot in jail.

Good!!  These large land owners, throughout Latin America, have terrorized people for years, usually with US help because the poor are called "communists."  Anti-insurgency funds often end up being used to kill anyone who speaks against injustice.

Mr.Galvao truly deserves to reap what he has sowed. Greed, thievery, and murder must not be rewarded by a judicial slap on his wrist. Execute him and his fellow conspirators.

So much for the value of a human life or the rain forest...One man's greed took away hundred's of people's happiness. I hope he is shanked within the first 24 hours of serving his sentence.

One of the biggest destroyers of forest/species diversity in the tropics, as well as destruction/killing of Indian tribes.....is cattle ranching, soy farming and logging. Clearing/logging-out tropical rainforest to create temporary/artificial grasslands for cattle, in tropical forest areas, is highly destructive to tropical topsoil, rivers and biodiversity. Cattle should be raised in areas where grasslands and grazing animals occur naturally. After tropical rainforest is cleared to create cattle ranches and soy farms, the heavy year around tropical rains washes away the topsoil, which was once protected, for millions of years, under the forest canopy. The intense year round tropical sun then scorches and dries out the topsoil, further increasing erosion/soil run-off into local rivers and streams. As the eroded soil, heavy metals and farm chemicals caused by ranching, soy farming, mining and forest-clearing washes into rivers, it then suffocates fish and buries fish eggs. This eroded soil and debris then washes down rivers and out to coastal areas, burying and killing corals and other coastal sea-floor life.The temporary grasslands/farmlands created by clearing tropical forest then becomes quickly degraded and unfarmable, forcing the ranchers and farmers to clear-out even more rainforest to maintain profits/farming. In the process Amazon Indians are forced out of their forested homelands and often killed by individuals who are likely paid by the cattle ranchers, soy farmers and timber cutters.The Indians main source of protein......river fish, becomes increasingly scarce and their forced to migrate even deeper into the remaining jungle to find clean water and fish......and to avoid being murdered. A similiar scenario has been unfolding in Indonesia and Malaysia, the problem there is PALM OIL PLANTATIONS......and the extremely high concentration of palm oil plantations in these two southeast Asian countries....which is rapidly deforesting both countries and heavily impacting indigenous people there, who are heavily dependent on forests and river fishing. Palm oil is used in processed foods and biofuels for cars and trucks.

Well, you should have know that you weren't in 'Kansas anymore' Dorthy!   And now you can be added to the list of nice young 'gringas' who stick their silly american-pie noses into places where nice young foreigners can get snuffed ...'just like that'.  And it is too bad because...NUNS ARE HOT!  :)  Oh, well, I am sure she has learned her lesson now.  NEXT...??  And all you 'want to be' activists, you just think about that.  Have a nice day, eh?!

A boat carrying over 90 passengers capsized on Ghana's Lake Volta, killing two and leaving 10 missing, a rescue official said.
"The boat was carrying 92 passengers when the disaster occurred. Some survivors were rescued by the villagers while others managed to swim ashore," Amadu Baba Seidu, a disaster management coordinator in the area told AFP.
The accident took place late Tuesday in the Kete-Krachi district, more than 600 kilometres north of the capital Accra.
Search efforts were still underway to find bodies of the 10 still missing in Lake Volta, Ghana's largest lake.

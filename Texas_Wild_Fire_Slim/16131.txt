					Texas Wildfire Animation				



 
I found this online… watch how quickly the fires grow and just how widespread they are.
This morning brought some good news as the fire in Bastrop has been 30% contained and finally some “big guns” were brought in with the “10 Tanker.” The “10 Tanker” has the capacity to hold 11,600 gallons of flame retardant. So, hopefully, as the smoke clears, there will be nothing but “blue skies” with the chance of rain.

This is a good way to watch what is happening. Also it’s a wake up call for us to be careful and get prepared.  Thanks for posting this.

Hugh Jackman leaves a lot of the fighting to the robots in the upcoming "Real Steel," but that didn't mean he got off easy. No, the Golden Globe-nominee had to work to get himself in tip top shape once again.
Having had to massively bulk up for his role as mutant warrior Wolverine on a number of occasions, the Aussie actor had to this time take on the body of a broken down boxer. As he and his trainers tell Men's Fitness in their upcoming issue, that took a lot of fight training to learn the moves and put on 30 pounds of muscle for reshoots -- something he didn't quite enjoy doing.
"I don't really enjoy training. People say it's addictive, but I'm like, 'not so much,'" he says. "If I weren't getting paid or didn't have a character like Wolverine to maintain, I would just be a tall, lean, fit guy."
Well, that's not a bad alternative, either. And maybe one he'll want to pursue as he gets older and snacks become more alluring.
"Over the past three or four years it's gotten a lot tougher," Jackman says. "I have to eat a stricter diet. I have to train even harder.  I can't get away with what I used to."
Especially when he's starring in movies literally titled, "Butter."

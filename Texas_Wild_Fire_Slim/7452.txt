Federal court rejects Snipes' appeal in tax caseAP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011





ATLANTA (AP) — A federal appeals court in Atlanta has turned away the latest attempt by actor Wesley Snipes to get his conviction and prison sentence on tax charges overturned.The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Tuesday rejected the appeal by Snipes, who was convicted in 2008 on three misdemeanor counts of willful failure to file income tax returns.Defense lawyers contended they received two emails from former jurors who reported misconduct among other members of the panel. But the court held that it wasn't "strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence" that would warrant a new trial.Snipes started a three-year term in a Pennsylvania prison in December. He's appeared in dozens of films, from "White Men Can't Jump" and "Demolition Man" in the early 1990s to the blockbuster Blade trilogy.

This guy made his MILLIONS through the TAX PAYING, movie viewing PUBLIC.  It seems that he believed that HE was SPECIAL, and didn't NEED to pay taxes.  Find a country that has NO taxes and STILL provides the opportunity to get as RICH as THIS guy got.

Three misdemeanor charges?  How does this make sense?  I would rather he be out working instead of paying for prison time on tax evasion..  Come on, a couple movies right to DVD would help out..

He better hope that "Bubba" already has a "friend with privileges" or he will find himself unable to control his sphincter muscle!

Just pay  the time and money you owe you snibbling little biooooootch just like the rest of us taxpayers !!!!!!!!!!!!

Their defense is disappointing, arguing that some juror probably told one of his friend he was on the Snipes' jury (or whatever) rather than sticking by the defense that the taxes are unconstitutional.

[Except, of course, that the constitution does allow during wartime, and now we're in an endless War on Terror...but if this had happened pre 9/11, he would have had a case.]

Its just three year, Wes.  You played with fire and you got burned.  I mean, you're lucky you got off this light.  Jerking with the IRS is just a horrilbe idea. You're still loaded, you'll be fine.  Word of advice:  when you get out, ditch the beret and the weird glasses.

He thought he could be so prominent and not file income taxes???

Its pretty lame to make a guy serve 3 years for a non-violent non-felony 1st time offender.  Failing to file?  restitution amount.......0  Max fine could only be 3k.  The Feds are way way way out of control.

Who the #$%$ is this Judges Boss ???Who over see Judges Rulings.....???These #$%$ judges are given to much authority and wheel their gavel which ever way they feel at that moment....You kill someone in car accident ...get 5 to 10 yrs......PROBATION....Kill someone in fight...get 5 yrs ...prison....2/12 with good behaviorRob and kill someone ...get  10 yrs.....7 with good time...Kill a cop get ...20 to life.....Accountant fuc...ks up your taxes.........you get Fu...cked.... WITH A misdemeanor NOT A FELONY....This judge is a niga hater......or Jealous a black man makes more money than him....

Hey AP, you forgot to mention that Mr Snipes claimed he was being picked on by the IRS because he is Black. Not that he is a slag who thinks taxes are an option.

Just like a liberal....other people can pay just not me.
Let him sit in jail.

A lot of Hollywood's stars moved to other countries to escape taxes, anybody want to guess if Snipes will make the same move?




 






Terry J

As we all know Snipes is just another example of the government flexing their muscle's PAY YOUR TAX OR ELSE!!! Like Nor'wester said" A couple of movies" would pay his bill. No government agency including The Supreme Court will be inclined to consider the sentance. I bet he doesn't even get 3 for 1 time served. Point made; Our government can waste billions but if one of its subjects tries to take millions they are in deep do do!!!

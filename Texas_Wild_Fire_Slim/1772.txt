				Romney's half-right with his magnet analogy. The half he missed though is that magnets also repel. Along with turning off the magnet of employers hiring illegals, the magnet which repels people from their home country must also be turned off.

				If you're going to be watching the GOP Presidenti­al debate tonight, you might as well have fun while doing so. And with the help of our official drinking game, you shouldn't have any. 

You so comically show the glasses with the photos filled to the brim but these glasses will tatter and chatter and some may shatter  in the debates because they will be real and empty so no drinking but de ---- baiting and if they drift drunk then the whole exercise would be demeaning and very de -- morally --- mocratic.    good luck and let us have some comedy in the media  as they say in Texas ---Cooome on NOW with accent.

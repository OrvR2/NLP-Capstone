AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A major wildfire and a temperature inversion combined to bring smoky skies and an air quality advisory to Central Texas.The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality issued an orange alert. A thick haze covered much of the Austin and San Antonio area Wednesday morning and ozone levels were expected to reach hazardous levels by afternoon.The commission advised the elderly, infants and people with respiratory problems not to exert themselves due of the poor air quality.The National Weather Service said the situation was made worse by a temperature inversion, in which warm air at high altitude trapped cooler air at the surface, keeping the haze in place until Wednesday afternoon. The air in Austin smelled like pine and cedar, which have been fueling the wildfire 20 miles away.

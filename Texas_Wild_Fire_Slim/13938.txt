Texas Wildfire Giveaway Fundraiser!





Hello friends! Saturday, I told you about what is going on in my neck of the woods, and how much we need your help! Today is the day that you can help!

I have a fabulous giveaway lined up for you!

First up is Gussy, who responded right away to my e-mail for help!

She writes:

Hi there -- my name is Maggie Whitley and I'm the owner & designer of Gussy Sews. I spend a lot of time working on my blog and my shop, both are my dream jobs! On my blog you'll find updates on my handmade shop,  tips on how I left my day job about 15 months ago to focus on Gussy  Sews, plus different prompts/projects that help build a handmade  community of inspiration & adventuring. Interested in what fills the  "shelves" of my shop? All sorts of sassy, girly, colorful accessories:  *new* camera strap slipcovers, tote bags (3 different sizes), zipped  pouches, eReader cases, headbands -- all sporting my signature ruffle.

{Market Tote}



{Camera Strap Cover}
 How adorable are all of these? I personally own a market tote {and I am in L-O-V-E!} which I get compliments on all.the.time. You will not regret making a donation to win some of her high-quality, handmade products! I have a Gussy wish-list that is pretty long.

Gussy has generously donated a $50 shop credit to the lucky winner! 

Next we have miss Liz from the Blue Eyed Owl.

She writes:

Hi, I’m Liz. I am the author of The Blue Eyed Owl, a blog about all things vintage, handmade and my life as mom, wife and indie business owner. I run an online vintage and handmade boutique on Etsy with retail space at The Main Street Antique Mall near my home in Mesa, AZ.

My heart goes out to everyone who has been affected by the wildfires in Texas. My family in Austin has been sending pictures and updating us on the damage, it is just devastating. Living in Arizona, I am no
stranger to wildfires. Our family cabin has been threatened several times and I have see the destruction first had. Please know that my thoughts and prayers are with you Texas!
Isn't she the sweetest? And her shop is pretty sweet too! I, for one, would love to own this vintage milk bowl:


Or perhaps these hand-made pinwheel bobbies? Yes please!


   Annnnd, she's donating a $25 shop credit to the winner! Lucky ducks!
The next shop owner is actually the author of a blog that I sponsor. Diana has been great throughout this whole thing, blasting social media, sending out e-mails, writing on her blog. She rocks! Her shop rocks too. I mean, how cute/warm does this hand-knit cowl look? 


About herself she writes:
hey everybody! my name is dianapantz and i blog over here!  i write about being vegan in the midwest, riding my bike and turning my  hobby into a career. come over and hang out! i share fun projects,  pictures of the everyday and other goodies.i also run this shop  where i sell winter wear [think headbands, hats, scarves and cowls],  kids accessories [bow ties and babypantz!], and farmers market totes.


Diana is offering a $10 shop credit AND she's going to match a chunk of the donations we receive here!
And lastly, even though I do not own a shop, I wanted to contribute, so I am donating a $25 Starbucks gift card to the lucky winner, and I am matching the first $50 in donations.

Honor the Fallen








{Source}



“Now, we have inscribed a new memory alongside those others. It’s a  memory of tragedy and shock, of loss and mourning. But not only of loss  and mourning. It’s also a memory of bravery and self-sacrifice, and the  love that lays down its life for a friend–even a friend whose name it  never knew"-President George W. Bush

Texas Wildfire Relief Post





Howdy, friends. Some of you know that I am from Texas. I don't know how much it shows, but I love my state. Southern hospitality, Blue Bell Ice Cream, football, two-steppin' and Tex Mex. But, what I love the most is how when bad things happen to us, we dig in our heals and help each other rebuild.

After Hurricane Ike, neighbors rebuilt together, people shared their generators, their food, their grills. We rolled up our sleeves and made sure that we all got into the business of getting back to normal. We're putting that to the test at the moment because Texas is currently fighting and recovering from the busiest fire season in our history.

The worst you have probably heard about: a fire that started on September 4th near Lost Pines and Bastrop burned over 34000 acres of land with 2 lives and 1386 homes lost. It is still only 30% contained. Folks are without food, water, their most prized possessions. Some are still in shelters after evacuating with a few minutes notice and they have no idea if their pets, their homes, their lives are OK.

And that isn't only the one big fire; countless smaller ones have wrought their destruction on communities, one about 45 minutes from where I currently live. We were never in danger but our community has felt the shock, and the uncertainty especially considering that we're still fighting it. According to the Texas Forest Service we've lost about 21,000 acres from that fire and it is also only 30% contained {down from 85%}. Its close to the Texas Renaissance Festival which has not been affected but is serving as a base for firefighters and emergency personnel.

Speaking of firefighter and emergency personnel, we have seen first-hand the commitment that our firefighters have to the people of Texas, and the generosity coming from all areas of the country. They have been there from the beginning, fighting to save people's homes, and mourning with them when they couldn't. We owe them a lot for what they do.

Here's what's needed now: Money, water, clothes, food, gatorade, everything.

And here's how you can help.

Monday I will be hosting a benefit giveaway featuring Gussy Sews, Dianapantz, the Blue Eyed Owl, and myself {value = $100!}. In order to enter you will have to a) donate money to a cause benefiting the wildfire relief effort and b) spread the word.  The more money you donate, the more of a chance you have of winning {and if your entry is chosen, you will have to PROVE your donation}, AND the more money that will be helping! Both myself and Diana will be matching the donations pledged in the giveaway.

And so, I am calling on you to help me spread the word! Twitter {use  #TxBlogFireRelief hashtag}, Facebook, blogging, anything!

Organizations that are helping:
The American Red Cross {specify Texas Wildfires in your donation}, especially the Red Cross of Central Texas and the Greater Houston Area Red Cross.
Texas Wildfire Relief
United Way of Montgomery County
Bloggers Without Borders

If you live in Texas you can also take donations to any 4-H office or coordinate with your local fire-station. Many local chambers of commerce, YMCAs, banks, and grocery stores are joining the effort. 

And of course, if you would like to contribute to the giveaway or match donations, there is always room! Please contact me at lreichstein {at} gmail {dot} com.

I'll see you Monday! Spread the word {note: I am @AdvntrsNFlpFlps}.

Healthy Egg Salad





When my friend Lena hosted her Tea Party, she planned on having several different kinds of tea sandwiches; artichoke and caper spread, cream cheese with cucumbers, and cream cheese with peach preserves, and egg salad. She planned on buying the egg salad, but in her local grocery stores there were only small containers of kosher egg salad for $4. Um, not worth it.

So, I offered my egg salad-making expertise {um, did I mention that I had never made egg salad before} and used my very favorite tuna recipe as a base. The result was delicious, fresh, crunchy, and surprisingly healthy! No full-fat mayo, no mush {I really hate smushy egg salad}! You can really sub any of the veggies here to suit your own preferences and budget {although, this was pretty inexpensive!}

Ingredients:
8 hard boiled eggs, chopped {this is not set in stone; I had nine made but, um, maybe ate one for breakfast....}
 1/2 diced red pepper
2 stalks diced celery
1 diced carrot
1/4 cup light mayo
3 tablespoons non-fat yogurt
1 juiced lemon 

Directions:
Add all ingredients into a large bowl.

Stir to combine {yeah, I told you this was easy!} 
 Store in the refrigerator and let flavors meld for a few hours or overnight.


Form into cute sandwiches and have a tea party!



Enjoy everyone!

A little bit bookish





We all know that I love books {no really, Lauren, tell us something we don't know!}. When I was a kid my mom had to force me to go outside because reading a book just seemed so much better than running around and getting sweaty! Weird considering I always read about kids going outside and getting sweaty in Little House on Prairie, The Bobsey Twins, The Babysitter's Club, and The Boxcar Children.

I have loved books since before I can remember and I read almost everything. My childhood was filled with trips to bookstores and libraries, and I still have many of the books that I bought with my allowance {and later, my salary from my job in the mall}. My dream house will be filled with books, anytime I have an office it is overrun with them. I cannot imagine life without knowledge, without characters, and marvelous descriptions of fantasy worlds and extravagant love affairs. Many of my dreams were born from books, and one day, I'm going to write one.

I just don't know how else to express how much books encompass my way of living, so I thought I'd let some others do it for me. Here are my favorite pins about books on Pinterest {warning: one of these quotes is not appropriate for little eyes and contains some strong language/themes! It is the 7th quote and the background is a turquoisey color if you would like to avoid reading it}:

And, I love with every single quote from Bookfessions. So, you should go there and just read all of them.

What inspires you about books? What did you read as a kid?!

**As a side note: I know this is not related to Gussy's prompt, but in Texas we have/had some scary fires going on. I'm trying to organize a coordinated giving effort among bloggers to donate to the Red Cross of Central Texas, The United Way of Montgomery County, and the Texas Wildfire Relief Fund. Please let me know if you're interested in participating in the effort somehow, or just go donate! In a few days I will have a post up about everyone who is doing something {bloggers and non-bloggers alike} and I'll also have an awesome giveaway fundraiser!

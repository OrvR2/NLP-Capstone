Zagat recently polled 6,064 people for its annual Fast Food Survey, in categories ranging from best coffee (Starbucks) to best salad (Panera). Among chains with up to 5,000 locations, Five Guys was deemed the most popular (which perhaps comes as no surprise), followed by Panera, Chipotle, Chick-fil-A and in fifth place, In-N-Out. Last year, Five Guys also took top prize, though In-N-Out was the victor in 2009. Five Guys was not only the most popular chain; it also dominated the best burger category, putting In-N-Out in second place and McDonald's in fifth. McDonald's did, however, rank highest in value, child-friendliness and drive-thru experience.
Among chains with over 5,000 locations, Subway took the top popularity spot, followed by McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King and Taco Bell bringing up the rear.
The survey also covered full-service chains. Cheesecake Factory won in best salads, appetizers, desserts and value, but fell to fifth place for its pasta offerings. Although Maggiano's Little Italy dominated the pasta category, its value, steak and seafood were not as well-liked. Other notable winners included Red Robin for its burger, IHOP for its coffee and Cracker Barrel for its breakfast.
The survey participants averaged 6.3 meals per month at a fast food chain (the national average is about 10 fast food meals monthly) and 4.4 visits to a full-service chain.
Here are some of the key results of Zagat's fast food survey:
Fast Food - Large Chains
1. Five Guys
2. Panera Bread
3. Chipotle Mexican Grill
4. Chick-fil-A
5. In-N-Out Burger

				White Castle? On a road trip to Quebec this summer we went out of our way to find one. The sliders are a disgusting­, but surefire way of getting heartburn. And there is too much packaging. Even a small meal generates twice as much throw out stuff as any other fast food place. Did you see all the trash Harold and Kumar generated with their meal? Sickening. I would never go back. The best fast chain burger, in my opinion, is Whataburge­r. Freshly made, lots of meat, a tasy bun, great condiments -- just what a burger was meant to be. We have WB here in Texas and also in New Mexico and in Arizona, but I don't know if they exist in other states. In n out -- call it the blah burger. It doesn't taste like anything, but the price is right.

				On a serious note, these "dollar menus" are really bad.  With money tight it is a real viable option for folks that are pinching pennies.  The long-term implicatio­ns of this type of diet are well know and very costly on many levels.

My thought would be that 'dollar menu' options are made healthy as possible - I'm sure marketing and focus groups would beg to differ...

And their fries stunk (despite a massive pile of them).  And their prices are off the chart.

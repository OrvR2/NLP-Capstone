                     CHRISTOPHER SHERMAN and APRIL CASTRO The Associated Press BASTROP, Texas - Firefighters are tamping down hotspots and holding back flames from a wildfire that has burned for days across Central Texas, incinerating nearly 1,400 homes and tens of thousands of acres of drought-parched land, officials said Friday. The fire in and around Bastrop, about 25 miles east of Austin, officially remained 30 percent contained, but crews had surrounded and closed in on the flames and no new homes were reported destroyed overnight. "It seems to be holding well today," public information officer Annette Grijalva-Disert said....

If you want to experience an urban wilderness, visit William Goodrich Jones State Forest. It is located on FM 1488, 1.5 miles west of Interstate 45 in Conroe, Texas. This video highlights some of the things to see and do at the forest. For additional information, call the Texas Forest Service district office at 936-273-2261. The forest was purchased in 1926 and named after W. Goodrich Jones, the founder of the Texas Forestry Association and considered the Father of Texas Forestry. The health and productive forest that exists today is a result of public forest stewardship after heavy logging, devastating wildfires and insect epidemics that were common at the turn of the century. Jones State Forest is managed to encourage Red-cockaded Woodpeckers. The primary purpose of this forest is resource education for all Texas citizens and visitors. Sound scientific forest management that protects and perpetuates native flora and fauna is practiced. It is a working forest owned and administered by the Texas Forest Service. The forest is an outdoor classroom, with resource education, demonstrations, and nature study. Group educational tours are available by appointment. Recreational opporturnities include: birdwatching, hiking, horseback riding, picnics, wildlife viewing, and biking. Additional Youtube videos are being produced to describe Jones State Forest in more detail. Videography by Ken Kramm. Royalty-free music by Kevin MacLeod: incompetech.com Category: Education

When wildfires break out in the state of Texas, the first call goes to the Texas Forest Service, which is part of the Texas A&M University System. But the Texas Forest Service is also an all-hazards agency, providing support during any catastrophe that strikes the state.

WG Jones State Forest uses Fire as a Management Tool

Author: KennethKramm


If you want to experience an urban wilderness, visit WG Jones State Forest in Conroe, Texas. This video is one in a series about the forest. Today's video highlights the use of fire for habitat restoration. Most firefighters are responsible for putting fires out, but Texas Forest Service firefighters also start fires to help the forest and its occupants. Fire is a natural component in many ecosystems. It is integral to the function and biodiversity of numerous habitats. Organisms in these habitats have adapted to withstand and exploit natural wildfires. Unfortunately, campaigns in the United States have historically molded public opinion to believe that wildfires are always harmful. This view is outdated and incorrect. Fire suppression, in combination with other human-caused environmental changes have resulted in unforeseen consequences. In an effort to restore the balance in the pine forest ecosystem, fire is commonly used as a management tool to restore the habitat and increase wildlife. On the Jones State Forest, fire is used primarily to control understory plant species that could impact the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker. Fire eliminates mid-story vegetation which predators might otherwise use to access woodpecker nesting cavities. Controlled "prescribed burns" also reduce the likelihood of uncontrolled and disastrous wildfires. Stay tuned. An upcoming video, in the series about Jones State Forest, will focus on Red-cockaded Woodpeckers. This bird is only one of <b>...</b>

We were called to assist another fire department on a large wildland fire about 30 miles away. We took the 5 ton 6x6 and another crew brought a 1 ton 4x4. We teamed up with a dozer crew from Texas Forest Service shortly after our arrival. This truck works great for wildland fires because it carries 1200 gallons of water and can fight fire for long periods before filling up.

Red-cockaded Woodpeckers at WG Jones State Forest, Conroe, Tx

Order: Reorder
Duration: 7:43
Published: 2011-05-06
Author: KennethKramm


This video is an introduction to the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis). These birds live in mature pine forests in southeastern United States. You will learn about habitat requirements, see inside a nest cavity and see the banding of nestlings. The nesting season is from mid-March to late-July on the Jones State Forest. Living in small family groups, Red-cockaded Woodpeckers are a social species. The family group may include the male, female, their chicks and young adult helpers. These helpers typically are related young from a previous nesting season. They help build cavities and care for chicks. Pecking a cavity in a live tree takes up to a year or more. The birds also peck the bark around the entrance to get the sap (resin) flowing around the hole. The sticky sap keeps predators, like snakes, away from the adjacent cavity. The bird's diet consists of insects found under the bark and along branches of pine trees.

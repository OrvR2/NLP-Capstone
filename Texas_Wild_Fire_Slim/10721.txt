iPhone remains No. 1 in customer satisfaction, RIM ranks fifthBy Chase KellAssociate EditorPostsWebsiteEmailBy Chase Kell | The Right Click – Fri, 9 Sep, 2011

If you believe sales propel a product atop its respective market, you'll agree the Android smartphone is the best out there.
But some might argue sales are not completely indicative of market dominance, that customer satisfaction holds sway over purchased products.
For the sixth consecutive study, J.D. Power and Associates found Apple's iPhone to hold the highest rank in customer satisfaction, a rank the iconic phone has held for the past three years.
HTC - maker of both the Android and Windows smartphones - ranks second with Samsung, Motorola and Canada's RIM rounding out the top five.
The 2011 U.S. Wireless Smartphone Customer Satisfaction Study documents the experiences of nearly 7,000 smartphone users between the months of January and June.
Gadgetbox lists the key factors in order of importance: performance (35 per cent); ease of operation (24 per cent); features (21 per cent); and physical design (20 per cent).
Size - in terms of screen and the phone itself - apparently means the world to the average user. Smartphones weighing less than five-ounces, with a body less than .45 inches thick, received the highest praise among the study's users.
Smartphone camera megapixels hold their own weight as well, but the term "the more, the merrier" doesn't seem to apply. Devices with "at least five megapixels achieve nearly as high a satisfaction score as those smartphones with eight megapixels or more."
"Having the right combination of physical dimensions and operating functions and features for both smartphones and traditionally equipped devices is key to creating an exceptional ownership experience with each type of wireless device," says J.D. Power in a Gadgetbox story.

I've used nokia phones most of my life. theyre really great phones but alot of people find the Maemo OS difficult and the symbian OS old but for me it was the customer service and warranty which sucked. 
I switched to Iphone and before Iphone I couldnt do without a keypad but iphone got me used to full touch at its best. I got rid of the Iphone because I wanted to try the new Android powered Samsung Galaxy S2 which seemed to me like the best phone on the planet. Just then the new Blackberry Bold 9900 was dropping so I got it instead just as  try out phone. I love it so Im considering keeping it. 
In my opinion Blackberry survives mostly because of BBM, I say so because if most of my friends and family didnt have BBM I would not get a blackberry. Android phones are taking th market by storm, and people stick to iphone because it introduced them to a level of smart phone and an app store never experienced in its time and ppl stick to what they know and trust. but eventually Android will take over.

BS. Apple is popular mostly due to it's marketing. That's it. Check out the iPad2 and it's competitors for example... the iPad2 isn't the best performer in any category you'd care to name.

ANDROID LOCKED THE FRONT CAMERA SO IT CANT BE USED!!!  IT IS TERRIBLE HOW THEY RIP OFF THE CUSTOMER.Also, most of the android apps are money making scams. I am switching to iPhone, even though it costs more.  Yay facetime!  Even skype works better on iPhone.

Samsung Galaxy Infuse 4G is the best.  Had the i4, and Galaxy 1, both can't compare.  Although the original Galaxy was better than the i4 as well.  But the new Samsung Android runs the market.  Biggest screen, fastest processors, awesome camera and ANdroid 2.3. No competition

Had all three. Give me a Blackberry anyday. All three have a different user group so this survey is not  indicative off needs. Iphone for younger groups (teens) Android for people who don't want to spend the money and don't need all the universal apps and Blackberry for the serious user.

I find this study hard to believe. I hear from most iPhone users that they constantly have problems and that the phone breaks easy, however they are such suckers they will claim their phones are the best and continue buying them.

Almost everyone I know owns a Blackberry of various models and I seldom hear of any complaints.

I own a Blackberry and would never own any other type of phone. I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab which runs on Android, and it truly is awesome.

I also have a hard time believing Apple is #1 in customer satisfaction. Sure at the store within your first year they will replace it but after that you're done unless you bought their warranty. Need to call them with a question? oh well hope you're still within you first 3 months otherwise that call is $35.00. Don't have a credit card for the $35.00? thanks for calling apple,click. Oh wait if I buy their warranty they will talk to me, suprise suprise. Hey my battery sucks can I replace it? Nope not myself cuz its built in. What do you mean my battery isn't covered by Apples warranty? Its $90.00 plus labour? Oh but again its covered by the extended warranty if I buy that as well. Hmmmm sounds pretty terrible to me. Think I will stick with my awesome Android that doesn't crash, has a ton of free apps and i can change the battery myself. Know how many times I have had to swap it ? Never. Tons of friends with Iphones that have had to swap it two or three times already and have only had the phone 5 months. If you dont believe me take a look at the warranty on your so called awesome iphone

Sanchez’s GQ style doesn’t pass the Aaron Rodgers test By      Doug Farrar



We recently revealed to you that when it comes to personal style, reigning Super Bowl MVP Aaron Rodgers believes that a sweet biker 'stache is the very peak. New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez(notes) recently displayed a different level of personal accoutrement in his cover story for the September issue of GQ magazine.
According to Rodgers himself during his most recent weekly appearance on ESPN's Milwaukee radio station, Sanchez's metrosexual leanings didn't really pass muster.
"Look at this, that's embarrassing," Rodgers said. "Page 94 of this GQ thing here, that's terrible."
That would be the photo of Sanchez in the black tank top and white pants you see here. GQ also featured Sanchez with the Joe College v-neck sweater look, bare-chested with black sweats and some kind of pseudo-Rob Johnson headgear thing going on, and hanging out in an old-school hot tub (why, we have no idea).
Rodgers, who started his road to the NFL at Butte College in Chico, Calif., tumbled down the draft board, and had to wait three years for Brett Favre(notes) to leave town, may not understand Sanchez's USC-to-the-Jets-to-high-profile lifestyle. It's just not the way he rolls.
"That's not really my style," he told the station. "I like my anonymity, I like my privacy. I like being able to be the quarterback during the week, and in the offseason be able to do what I want to do and not be in the public eye."
Keep in mind that Rodgers is the same player who slams teammate Clay Matthews (who played with Sanchez at USC) in the newest America's Game for the hair-flip he likes to do with his long, blond hair. He's just not big on frills.
"I don't like to watch him in pregame, because I think it's absolutely ridiculous," Rodgers said of Matthews. He loves to play to the camera, and he wants to say as much bizarre, crazy stuff as he can. I like to tease him about being Hollywood, and he tries to do the same thing to me. The difference between him and I is that I'm from Northern California and I act like it, and he's from Southern California, and he acts like it."
As Rodgers points out, it works solely because Mathews is such a dynamic player. Maybe if Sanchez gets a Super Bowl MVP award this upcoming season, Rodgers will get off his back as well.

1 users disliked this comment hombre 7 minutes ago Report Abuse rogers is good but he is a punk that sounds jealous.   so what if sanchez wants to dress that way, it's his decision to make.   if rogers wants to remain out of the limelight, then so be it.   i personally think that rogers is jealous because he doesn't   have the cajones to get into the limelight.   and sanchez does.   sanchez is who he is and so is rogers.   suck it up aaron, don't be a punk, be happy for the man, he deserves it even in you think he doesn't.   and by the way, your opinion is like an a&*(^%#, everybody has one.

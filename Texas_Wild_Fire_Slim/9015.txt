Model Sues ‘The Price Is Right’By Claudine ZapYahoo! Buzz LogPostsBy Claudine Zap | Yahoo TV – Wed, 7 Sep, 2011 3:56 PM EDT

Former 'Price Is Right' spokesmodel Lanisha Cole (Monty Brinton/CBS)(Yahoo! Buzz) — The longest-tenured model for "The Price Is Right" has filed a lawsuit claiming she was sexually harassed by two producers for the game show, Michael G. Richards and Adam Sandler (not the actors with the same names).
When model Lanisha Cole left the show in 2010, she was a "fan favorite," whose job was to gracefully reveal actual prices of household items to the viewing audience and contestants. But she alleges that backstage, for about a year, she endured very ugly treatment.
The 20-page civil complaint includes wrongful termination, wrongful sexual harassment, failure to take steps to prevent harassment, false imprisonment, and infliction of emotional distress.
The lawsuit states that Cole began working for the popular game show back in 2003, and enjoyed her job for years. All that changed in 2009, when Richards took an interest in another model and began to favor her -- and shun Cole. The suit claims that her work on the show was limited using policies "which never before existed."
Cole also details an incident where Sandler entered her dressing room without knocking despite a sign posted to do so, and berated the model for not wearing a microphone -- when she was wearing barely any clothes. Cole's attorney said of the account, "Sandler deliberately humiliated Ms. Cole in front of her peers."
Cole's attorney, Solomon Gresen, said in a statement, "This case is about senior-level men in the entertainment industry exploiting power and control over women by bullying and harassing female talent." He added, "Ms. Cole did nothing to provoke Richards and Sandler. Once the harassment began, she was powerless to stop it."
Cole complained about her harassment only after being called into a meeting regarding alleged harassment of another model. When the Pasadena native filed her suit, she was told she was "holding the show hostage," and she eventually left the show.
Host Drew Carey is not named in the lawsuit or blamed in any way. Cole is seeking a jury trial and monetary compensation to cover her medical and legal expenses and loss of earnings. "The Price Is Right" has been served with multiple sexual harassment lawsuits over the years. The show has not yet commented.

Wrongful sexual harassment.  There's a right type of sexual harassment?  o_O

It is hard to say as none of us as were there, just read this story - maybe the poor girl was harassed but maybe she just wants to make money off of them.

Another youth tryin' to "get rich or die tryin'".  As soon as she was not the number 1 out come the lawsuits for harrassment.  Women have watered harassment, rape and sexual assault down to being mean to a woman.  If her feelings are offended well then she was harassed and possibly verbally raped.

As always women are strong and independent until they suffer any kind of setback, then they run to "daddy" (any authority agency or figure) and pout until they get their way.  Don't do as your bosses ask (or aks in her case) then you should be reprimanded.  Hell, sweetness, some people even get fired for that, you entitled, spoiled t**t.  

In a just world this case would be tossed out and she would be sued for wrongful prosecution but in PC BIzzaro World, this lady has a twofer.  Black and female, The Price Is Wrong, B**ch (by another Adam Sandler)

What an obscene and exploitative television show that is deprecatory to the human dignity. I'm surprised none of the contestants have complained about harassment. But the models are exploited too, I am not surprised about this story.

Sounds like a crock to me.  Guess it was ok when she was the big cahula but didn't like it when it was someone elses turn.  What a yawn!!

They all know why they got the job in the first place, it's because of their looks .
Now someone better looking comes along and that's the way it goes. She has to remember
that she took someones job a while back. Quit whining and accept that you did not get
the job for your smarts...

Oh the horror!  Barely any clothes?  Oh my friggen God!  Maybe she should have worn that microphone huh?  If a ditch digger showed up without his shovel, what do you think would happen?

Seems to me the problem is trespassing/ invasion of privacy.  Using sexual harrasment is an attempt to literally sex up the case.  But the effect to water down legit cases.  So I cannot support this.  She just comes off as an uppity whiney batch selfishly ruining it for less famous women who have real sexual harrassment gripes.  But, the article may well be incomplete.

These things happen gradually over time. She probably didn't leave sooner because she thought she could change it or it would stop. Who the hell are we to judge?

Melanie. What the hell are you? A psychiatrist? That's the problem with some women, the only reason this #$%$ goes on and on is because of things people like you say about the victim. This isn't the first time things like that has happened on Ol Bobs watch. instead of you supporting her you make a stupid remark like that.This same #$%$ could happen to you. I hope to God that it doesn't.

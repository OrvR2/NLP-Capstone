A student was killed after he remonstrated with youths who threw conkers at him, the Metropolitan Police Service said.
Officers believe the incident began when conkers were thrown at Steven Grisales, 21, as he made his way towards Silver Street railway station in Edmonton, north London.
"He initially remonstrated with the youths but one of the suspects produced a knife and stabbed him in the chest," a police spokesman said.
Grisales died of his wounds in the Royal London Hospital the next day, September 1.
A post-mortem gave cause of death as a single stab wound to the heart.
Grisales had moved from London to Argentina to live with his father, but he came back to London in July to start a three-year architectural course in September as part of a scholarship from Westminster College, the MPS said.
Detectives believe up to three young black males, possibly in their late teens or early 20s, carried out the attack.
A 19-year-old man, a 16-year-old girl and two 15-year-old boys have been arrested in connection with the murder and are in custody at a north London police station, the MPS said.
Appealing for witnesses who may have seen the incident, Detective Inspector Richard Beadle, of Scotland Yard's murder command, said: "It happened in a busy residential area and we know there would have been a number of people in the area at the time of the attack. We really need those people to talk to us."
Detectives have found no evidence to suggest the stabbing was gang-related.

Conkers are the seeds from the horse-chestnut tree and remosterated means he objected.  Basically this poor guy got killed when he told these filthy n*ggers to stop throwing the nuts at him.

Even in England n*ggers have no repect for life.

Blacks are thugs all over the world. The whites should have killed all of them when they found them. They should have known that you cannot domesticate all wild animals.

That is why I dislike the press, they never tell the whole story. The Argentina guy was calling them names N word, and he was throwing conkers at them first and it escalated from that. I feel they should be punished hard. I feel why worry about words. I hear just as many white people calling each other the n word. I hate when both races use the world, but that's ignorance for you. Rap has messed up a lot of cultures, just because the music companies want to make money, I think their all sell outs.

'Swhat happens when you don't have capital punishment.  These perps will be sentenced to free room, board, gym, and medical care for a few years and then released.

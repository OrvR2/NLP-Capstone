Have text of the transcript available.


This way you can watch or read with the volume off.  For instance, at work...

This is also a great idea. We are hearing this more and more. We have considered the accompanying text/story for those in an environment not conducive to video/sound etc.
We can't say how soon our update will arrive but please be assured this is high on the priority list, thanks!

Sort out polls


I like the polls but you repeat the same 3 colors for 6 different answers. Makes confusing results. Also, they need to be more visible. I didn't even realize you had so many polls!

We've heard this from a few people. Our next update includes adding a transcript or "articles" to each video for those who can't listen/view what we publish.
In addition, we'll consider adding a time stamp to the overall description of each piece, like a blog entry.
Thanks for you feedback!

link to more in-depth coverage from your one-minute overviews.


One minute is fine for an overview, but insufficient for more serious and/or in-depth coverage.  How about forming partnerships w/ other media and giving viewers the chance to dive deeper with curated links to relevant news stories?

Absolutely. We believe in depth. Our current model introduces the top two layers of our coverage: overview and supporting news. We hope to cover the essential, focusing on awareness and maybe some thought provoking questions. We really want to keep things simple and easy to understand. Certain topics do deserve or warrant more coverage this is true.
We are currently conceptualizing our news community layer and this will consist of many channels and curators that will provide depth, filterable content and more importantly, the connection to other individuals and organizations who are willing to connect with us. We want to share the responsibility of taking care of the news and how it's delivered. The community is meant to provide that depth and responsibility.
Thanks for all the feedback!

Polls


I enjoy seeing the poll results; is there a way to track our responses so we don't have to vote again each time in order to see the new results?
Also, it would be cool to post small thumbnails of popular poll results on the homepage.

Create a "Hot Topics" tab on the front page


I like the way you segregate stories into Sports, Technology etc. on the front page, but how about a "What's Hot" tab which tracks and displays the most viewed (based on number of watched clips) stories over the past 24 hours.

It would allow users who only have one minute to find and watch the most relelvant news very easily. I know you have a "what's trending" piece, but who decides what's trending? Surely the viewers should...? 
Thanks, great idea and nice website. I'm a fan. Looking forward to the I-Phone/I-Pad APP because that will take this idea to the next level.

We apologize if you've had any playback issues, or any trouble with OneMinuteNews at all. We have been working on some kinks and it should be functioning well across the board.
There shouldn't be issues with any separate browsers. You may have settings on your Flash player limiting smooth playback. If you right click on your player, go to settings, you may need to disable hardware acceleration.
This depends on the type of problem that you're having. Please let us know the specifics. You might want to note that OneMinuteNews will not work on Internet Explorer, version 7 and down. We can't be responsible for software not being up to date.
Thanks again for your feedback and we hope your experience here improves immediately, if it already hasn't.
Take care,
OneMinuteNews

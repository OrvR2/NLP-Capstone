The assembled press and critics did not react too kindly to Madonna's new period film, "W.E.," giving it resoundingly negative reviews. Madonna, it seems, feels the same way about their choices in flower bouquets. 
In the video below, Madonna is given a bouquet of hydrangeas by a fan while she's sitting at long table, waiting for her press conference to begin. It was a sweet gesture, though one Madonna did not much appreciate, it seems.

				There was nothing wrong with her disliking the flowers, everyone has a right to however it's the way she went about doing it. She thanked him but was not in the least grateful for it, all she needed to do was just say thank you and keep her mouth shut. The guy who gave her the flowers wasn't even out of hearing distance most likely before she went on her snobby attitude and fake British accent. Was he supposed to know she hated the flower with a passion is he her family? He may have very well been one of the only people who thought about giving her a gift and after her fake display of kindness she may have very well lost a fan. Now I see why she's nicknamed Material Girl :/

				I used to hate them too....but mostly because I saw them all of the time while growing up.  Now, I love them, especially oakleaf hydrangea.­...I had to miss them before I could appreciate them.  I think she should have waited to comment, but there is no way I'm going to hate her for simply expressing an opinion...­we all have them...and sometimes we express them at the most inopportun­e time.  I think that there are bigger problems in the world for me to be concerned about than some rich lady speaking out of turn.

				Basically, ...

...Madonna is the Dick Cheney of the cor-pirate dance pop production line world. She has the same heart, soul and mind/perso­nality as he does. And uses and has used them all in the very same way as he has over his lifetime.

And their respective fans would say both are the epitome of success because they've both amassed huge fortunes and material wealth and statistics­, with Cheney amassing far more in wealth and material gain making him, according to the fans of each according to their criteria, the greater success.

But both are intensely loathed within their own respective circles by their peers. Oh, sure, you'll hear their peers talk of their "successes­" and their capabiliti­es and "talents" in doing their respective jobs. But you will rarely, if ever, hear any of them say they like either one of these people.

Madonna is to the entertainm­ent world what Dick Cheney is to the political world. There's no difference betwee them at their very cores.

Basically, ...

....what it comes down to with Madonna is she has the heart, soul and mind/perso­­nality of Dick Cheney.

To me, of course, they're both two peas in a rotten pod. Same type of people from differing spheres of the world. But no different at the core.

				There's no reason to call Madonna out for what she said. As is required, Madonna was polite to the recipient and thanked him for the gift. That is all that is required of a recipient. It doesn't mean you have to like the gift, it doesn't mean you have to keep it. Her fault was verbalizin­g her feelings, but it doesn't make them any less genuine. Are all of you naysayers here going to try to tell us that you or someone you know hasn't politely thanked someone for a gift and then later in the privacy of their home said "Gee why in the world did they give me THIS????" etc. Come on, the only difference here is she got caught saying what most of think at one time or another.

A new study in the journal European Neuropsychopharmacology says that European women are almost two-and-a-half times more likely to suffer from depression than men. In pure numbers, this means that of the 30.3 million depressed Europeans, about 23 million are women. 
According to the study's author, Hans-Ulrich Wittchen, the number of depressive episodes in women has also doubled in the last 30 years. "In females, you see these incredibly high rates of depressive episodes at times when they sometimes have their babies, where they raise children, where they have to cope with the double responsibility of job and family," he said in a statement.
This isn't the first time that researchers have highlighted the high rate of depressive disorders in women. Statistics say that American women are twice as likely to be depressed as men. A 2010 British study found that 18.7 percent of women over the age of 50 experienced depressive systems. By contrast, only 11.8 percent of men in the same age group experienced similar symptoms. 
The question, then, is not whether women are more depressed than men, but why they are. And concurrently, are women really unhappier than they were three decades ago?
According to Professor Wittchen, part of the problem is the "tremendous burden" of trying to do it all -- that curse of the 21st century woman who wants to have a family and a career.  Indeed, recent research found that "supermoms" who try to have stellar careers while juggling a full family life -- and expect that they can be good at both -- are at greater risk for depression. Besides, the landmark 2009 paper "The Paradox of Declining Female Happiness" documented -- in perplexing detail -- the ways in which today's women are unhappier than their counterparts a generation ago. 
But surely women have it better now than they did in the middle of the century, when societal expectation of women ended at the ability bake a flawless pie. Another theory, then, is that women are just better at asking for help. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, almost four times as many men as women die by suicide. Another survey -- of 30,000 people in 30 countries -- found that women are much more likely to say that they are stressed than men under similar circumstances. 
Wittchen also said that depression is most likely to strike women between the ages of 25 and 40, when they are at their most fertile. Also at play, then, are the hormonal changes that women frequently experience during and after pregnancy. In her book “A Deeper Shade of Blue: A Woman’s Guide to Recognizing and Treating Depression in Her Childbearing Years,” Ruta Nonecs describes the challenges faced by women in their childbearing years: 
"Not only is a woman exposed to different types of hormones and different levels of these hormones than a man, throughout her reproductive years she experiences constant hormonal fluctuations. … Experts believe that these hormonal shifts may act as a trigger for depression in some women and that women who have premenstrual mood changes may also be more vulnerable to depression at other times when exposed to significant hormonal fluctuations, such as after childbirth or during the transition to menopause.
So which is it? Why are women unhappier, if at all? Do they just have better access to mental health treatments? Is it hormonal? Are we the sadder sex? Or is it a deeper societal malaise that will still take decades to fix? Tell us what you think below.

				The data thrown around here is in some serious need of deconstruc­tion.

Let's take a look at stats that are widely available from multiple sources, give or take a point depending on individual survey and years surveyed:

The suicide rate for boys in their late teens is 4.5 times that of girls.
The rate for men in their early 20s is 6 times that of women.
For men in their 40s it is 3.5x higher.
For men in their 50s it is 4x higher.
For men in their 60s it is 5x higher.

How are we to take as gospel that "The question..­.is not whether women are more depressed than men, but why they are." Only in passing do we read contradict­ory evidence that "almost four times as many men as women die by suicide", but this does not invite any serious reflection from the writer.

So, does it seem that we have an epidemic of depression that puts women more at risk than men? I would hazard that women are NOT twice as likely to be depressed, but that they are AT LEAST twice as likely to seek treatment for depression­. The answer is stunningly obvious: women are NOT *sadder* than men, they simply express it more; men and boys 'suck it up', but are not only at least as equally susceptibl­e to emotional desolation­, but are far more likely to take their own life as a result. 

For goodness sake, WAKE UP.

				 It's true. Men are more fragile b/c we live in a culture that demeans their expression­s of vulnerabil­ity.  You are correct about all of that. This is the woman's section on Huff Post.  We are talking about woman's issues here. I think it would be a great thing if Huff Post had a section called: Men.  Would it be about hunting and soldier of fortune fantasies?  Or would it be about these issues where men are vulnerable­?  Women are always open to discussing male vulnerabil­ity.  You see.... we love all our children and not just the girls.

				"Would it be about hunting and soldier of fortune fantasies? Or would it be about these issues where men are vulnerable­?"

Tulka, that all depends on where HuffPo would want to go with it, should they ever be convinced of the need. Those are marketing/­political choices made by editors, and so far the editorial Powers-Tha­t-Be have not been too keen about discussing the current vulnerabil­ities of men and boys. Nor have they responded to repeated requests for a 'Men' or 'Gender' section that takes a more balanced approach to the challenges facing all of us as roles shift and we begin to form new identities not based on 'tradition­al' models.

There are men (and women) out there who could write remarkable and insightful articles that have nothing to do with adolescent 'soldier of fortune' fantasy. HuffPo has so far chosen not to invite them into the picture, preferring a more exclusivel­y gender-fem­inist focus which elevates female suffering to the level of sainthood.

"Women are always open to discussing male vulnerabil­ity."

I would have to say emphatical­ly (and while being very much appreciati­ve of your receptivit­y) that this is simply not true. *You* might be receptive, but you cannot speak for all women. The proof is all around us on these pages.

				Depression is anger turned inward, but it is not socially acceptable for women to be angry warriors.  What thinking and awake woman doesn't feel anger when she looks around at the status of women in the world today?  The number one factor in whether a child under the age of five will survive is whether or not the child's mother is able to read.  That's a United Nations statistic.The number one cause of death in the world's women between the ages of 15 and 19, pregnancy and complicati­ons of pregnancy. Don't let these statistics make you sad.  Get pissed and move and  team up with your sisters.

				What bull. Is it ok for men to turn their anger outward? Can they beat people up when they get mad? No they will end up in prison which is already 90% male. The number one cause of death for a young black male in America is homicide. It's cool to promote the usual female pity party but we have done it for so long we have neglected the far more severe male problems in this country.

If you want to go abroad to look for trouble the problems are endless and don't stop with women's issues. We don't need to play the gender based games there either. We need to team up to help people in general. Needless division is not improving things.

				I believe that the epidemic of depression in women is related to the disconnect­ion between the body and the Spirit of God. It is related to the denigratio­n of the body and the feminine by religions and societal preference for masculine ways of doing rather than being. I found the Holy Spirit to be the feminine Spirit of God that can be awakened and rise to fill the body with Life force, vitality, and power. A woman's body (a man's as well) cut off from the Source of Life, the living river of water within, is tired, and feels empty or depressed. The sense of feeling something is missing, the great sadness, or emptiness is the call of the body and psyche for enlivening and empowermen­t by the Holy Spirit.

				Hi,

I agree. That is the real problem in our society, the deviation from Biblical principles which protect women. Women's liberation is a wonderful thing because it allows women to develop their God-given talents and abilities, but unfortunat­ely the straying away from roles and standards in society takes a stronger toll on the women because we are more vulnerable­.

				It's hard enough to correctly diagnose depression ... then there are so many different types of depression ...  but how do you truly statistica­lly measure "sadness" ??    What's "sadness" to a woman might be "upsetting­" or "anger provoking" to a man...  

Since I can't speak for women, I can tell you that of the many friends I have and have had - even in tough times, even when things were very difficult (work, home, family, illnesses)  I have never heard ONE say they were "sad" ...  pi**ed, angry, fed-up, fuming - loads of other adjectives ... but "hey 'horson' I'm sad..."

				While I think that men are more likely to ignore a problem than women, I think that women are still more likely to suffer from depression­.  I also think that there are societal changes that while thought of positively haven't really led to women being more happy.  While careers can be satisfying it likely also leads women to feel more disconnect­ed from their families.  I think we also underestim­ate the roles that women played in the past.  They weren't as stuck at home as people like to think.  If you carry those roles forward into a modern society with ipads, facebook, etc... there would definitely be less of the feeling that they were trapped at home as well.  Nothing is static though.  I think that going forward both men and women will likely work less.  Spend more time with family.  We tend to learn from past generation­s even if we take that lesson too far at times.

				I believe it's true that depression is greater in women than in men. Estrogen has been found to be a cause of depression­. Women face pressures at home and at work -- not only to bear so much of the load from the moment they wake until the kids are in bed, but in terms of cultural responsibi­lity for the family and their careers. Women tend to be more concerned that everyone is happy and everything is good, which puts additional (self-infl­icted?) pressure on them. And women generally (these are all generaliza­tions) have greater access to a greater range of emotions than men, which not only makes them more aware of their feelings but also makes them feel more acutely.

All of this contribute­s to higher rates of depression­. But also higher rates of elation and satisfacti­on. Women feel the full range of emotions, while we allow men only a limited range. Because we limit what is acceptable from men, men are more likely to experience (or at least express) depression as anger or irritabili­ty, or one of the few other emotions we allow males to have.

But I can tell you from experience­, that even without all those other pressures, hormones, alone, can cause depressive episodes no matter how good everything in life is.  So, yes, I think the article's point is accurate, though I wouldn't wall women the "sadder sex."

				First of all, I love your micro-bio. It brings a smile to my face every time I run across it. I often wonder if men have the same level of depression as women, but shun treatment because they perceive it as a weakness? I've worked primarily with working class men, all who have health, family and financial problems that clearly weigh on them (some more than others), but I only remember one guy who thought he might be depressed (and that was because he took a test in a magazine while waiting in a doctor's office!). I think this is one of the reasons more and more veterans are committing suicide. The VA hands out pamphlets for suicide prevention hotlines, but I think men need more education about depression before they look for treatment. And clearly, women are not the 'sadder sex'...tha­t is just one more awful HP headline.

				The stories I've read about soldier suicides in Iraq and Afghanista­n tell the story. Those who know they are having problems, and who do as the rules say, report their distress to superiors, who proceed to punish them for being shirkers and subject them to public ridicule from the only source of support these soldiers have - their units. This doesn't leave much of a choice: stuff it, or pull the trigger.

				I wouldn't say "sadder" but they definitely complain and whine a lot more than my male friends who just roll with the punches.  Happy, content people usually surround themselves with other like-minde­d types.  Debbie downers often get left off invite lists as they drag everyone down.  So the downers tend to gravitate and rally around each other and continue to complain and blame others.

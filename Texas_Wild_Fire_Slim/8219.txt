Differences with US on UN bid still wide: PalestiniansAFP – 17 hrs ago

The differences with Washington over the UN bid are "still wide," a senior Palestinian official said on Wednesday after talks with US envoys in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
"The gap between the Palestinian and US positions is still wide after the meeting," presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina told AFP.
"There are efforts being made and an agreement to continue communication with the US administration and the (Middle East) Quartet envoy," he said.
His remarks came shortly after Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas held talks with Washington's Middle East envoy David Hale and Dennis Ross, senior adviser to US President Barack Obama.
Hale and Ross are seeking to head off the Palestinian bid for UN membership later this month.
Israel and Washington are firmly opposed to the Palestinian campaign, arguing that a Palestinian state can be established only through negotiations.
"We are determined to protect our right to go to the UN to seek membership for the state of Palestine," Abu Rudeina added.
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat, also speaking to AFP, said the meeting "revealed the scale of the differences between the positions -- There is still disagreement on going to the United Nations."
During the meeting, the two officials had reiterated Washington's opposition to the Palestinian plan and stressed the "intense efforts" being made by Quartet envoy Tony Blair to secure a statement from the diplomatic grouping urging both sides to resume peace talks.
The State Department is also understood to be seeking ways to restart peace talks in a last-minute bid to head off the campaign for UN membership.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton telephoned Abbas late on Tuesday and urged him to "work hard with us to avoid a negative scenario in New York" later this month, a State Department spokeswoman said.
Direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians ground to a halt shortly after they were relaunched in Washington in September 2010 over the issue of settlement construction.
The Palestinians say they will not resume talks while Israel builds in annexed Arab east Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied West Bank, and they say any future negotiations must be based on clear parameters.
But they have also stressed they do not view the UN bid as excluding the possibility of new talks, and that a resumption of negotiations would not dissuade them from pursuing membership of the world body.

I can't wait for the Christians all over the world to realize that they hate Israeli Jews more than they hate Muslims...Palestinian Arabs consist of Muslims and Christians both fighting for Palestine as their country...I would imagine America would atleast stand up for their Arab Christian brothers & sisters....the Problems here is ignorance as many bashers here post out of hate...there are more Christians Arabs in Ramallah than the entire "State" of Israel.

UN 242 asks Israel to withdraw from territories it has illegally annexed in a "defensive" war it started by attacking first. The US voted on this, now wants to change its mind because of IAPAC contributions?

"Israel and Washington are firmly opposed to the Palestinian campaign, arguing that a Palestinian state can be established only through negotiations."  If that's the case, why are the US and israel trying so hard to stop the bid to the UN?  Obviously this is a big step in the right direction, otherwise the jews wouldn't be so nervous about it. Go Abbas!!

I can not understand how any liberty loving person has the right to tell the Palistinians that they cannot form a government. Why so many Americans can't see that the Palistinians suffer from much more than 'taxation without representation' is beyond me. I believe in liberty, I believe you have the right to fight for your freedom.

If the Palestinians will just wait a few more years, they won't have any country to argue about. 

The US is telling a drowning man to just stay under water until we tell him it's safe to breathe

Glug, glug, glug.

I think that it will be a strategic mistake for US to stop or veto the Palestinian bit to have their long-awaited state if they go forward with this issue. Stopping them can harm the US gains with Arab masses due to US administration stand with their revolutions. More importantly, stopping them can only play into the hands of terrorists and extremists like Al-Qaeda, Netanyahu, Lieberman, and Ahmadinejad.

Israel has to face the fact that the world is getting tired of their tactics and bully like actions. For a people who were once the victims of such hatred and heinous acts during World War II and at other times throughout history, it is hard to see how they can now be so militant and unyielding and not do everything in it's power to promote peace in the area. The apartheid state can no longer be allowed to exist and Israel must start to negotiate in good faith and bring peace to the area.

Obama and Hillary know that the Middle East is falling to new war in which nuclear weapons could be used that will harm US interests in the Middle East and will ruin worlds economy with no oil. 
Evidently, Obama is the Mozlem Brother Messiah of Hamas and the PLO as he already promised them Jerusalem and the control o9ver the Jewish cities of the Holyland. Obama was the first hostile president to the Jewish state who erased Jerusalem from the map of Israel and who denied the rights of Jews to build houses in their capital of 3300 years Jerusalem and in the biblical Jewish cities of the Holyland such as Bethel. Obama was able to oust Mubarak that supported the peace with Israel during more than 30 years only to bring to Egypt the rule of the Mozlem Brothers that wish to trash the peace treaty that US signed with Israel and Egypt in 1979. With Obama ruling the White House is presenting major danger to the security of the Jewish state while his financing of Hamas and Hezbollah, the Mozlem Brothers in Egypt and the al Qaida “rebels” in Libya. Obama hostility to the Jewish people while using liberal self hating Jews and the NY Times against Israel is bad news for Israel and the Jewish people that found isolated Jewish state.  Obviously, Obama is using the American presidency to undermine the rights of the Jews to live in their land of Israel since the Kingdom of David, and thus pushing the Middle East to full scale nuclear war.

Salexpo - the palestinians rejected the UN vote in 1948, not Israel.  Also, 1967 was a defensive war, your revisionist history notwithstanding.  Take the time to learn something before spouting off historical fiction.

In 1948, the US accepted the creation of a Palestinian State side by side with Israel s part of UN181. It cannot change its mind just because Israel wants it all....

Arabs inspired by Islam are the most successful butchers of humans and the worst 
practitioners of Apartheid in the history of humanity. Ask any non-Arab or Non-Muslim 
living in the Middle East or Africa.

Atrocities by Arabs committing ethnic cleansing and genocide on a massive scale in 14 
centuries amount to 300 million slaughtered people including 80 million Indians, 
120 million African Blacks, 50 million Europeans, 30 million Persians and 20 million others.

Netanyahu routinely invokes Israel’s “right of self-defen­ce” every time he tries to explain away some Israeli attack on Palestinia­ns... If the whole Israeli-Pa­lestinian discussion is about Israel’s right to defend itself, Israel wins the argument. But if it is about the occupation – which is, in fact, what the conflict has been about since 1993 when the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organizati­on] recognized Israel–it loses." He concludes, "Israel [is] not being isolated because it is a Jewish state and hence illegitima­te, but because of how it treat[s] the Palestinia­ns.

Netanyahu, your attempt to divide the U.N and Americans will fail. Our president has spoken, the United Nations has spoken,  The EU has spoken,  and the Americans have said no moooore aid.

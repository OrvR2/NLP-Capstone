Way to make me ashamed to be ashamed
http://writegray.posterous.com/way-to-make-me-ashamed-to-be-ashamed
      http://writegray.posterous.com/way-to-make-me-ashamed-to-be-ashamed




 
I'm a free-wheeling Appalachian Hipster internet writer now. I wasn't always that way. I spent well over a decade in normal offices, working my way through the corporate life, and trying to be relatively successful there. 

I possessed a nerd-flag I kept under my hat, though. "Hidden" would be the wrong word because everyone knew I played one game or another. But still. I kept my LARPing inclinations relatively private, and I didn't talk a whole lot about World of Warcraft or other such things. Even late in that career, when my position was relatively secure and my reputation solid, I kept "those" pictures off Facebook.

Nowadays, I don't game much. I'm busy writing, working on the house, working in the yard, working freelance, working, working ... see a pattern? I do miss some gaming here and there, but it's not really my focus. 

I like to make fun of my vampire friends and my LARP friends and my gamer friends. I'll ask Wehner things like "Is Deus Ex a good MMO, I hear it has good FPS" and such as a joke. I'll troll even the WoW Insider chat room a bit, just in good fun.

While I game, I've never really been much of a gamer. After all, I LARPed to meet girls. I started playing MMOs ... because of a girl. I started WoW because my wife wanted to do so. And so on. See another pattern here? 

So, all in all, I like to faux-pretend I don't like or understand gaming or gamers. It's a game in itself.

And then I see that damned post from Bereznak. And I can't make fun of, poke fun at, or otherwise mock gaming for a little while. 

While I don't think Bereznak quite meant to ridicule and deride gamers like Finkel as hard as she does, it does put a bad taste in my mouth. There's nothing wrong with being a MtG player. 

We all have our geek things. And Bereznak makes it out to be some mark of shame. Don't get me wrong, I'll still make fun of the OWbN obsessives and the mother's-basement WoW players ... but, for a while at least, I'm going to shut my damned gamer mouth. It was fun to pretend to be embarrassed of being a gamer, but this whole thing has made me ashamed to play ashamed.

Preposterously bad
http://writegray.posterous.com/preposterously-bad
      http://writegray.posterous.com/preposterously-bad

        
	I'm so preposterously bad at personal journalling it's almost amazing I keep trying.* Still, it's something I'd like to do more with, not less, so I'll keep giving it a whirl.  It's saturn peach season around here. If you've never had a saturn peach, the wife and I can't recommend them enough. They're amazingly sweet without the sharp tang of normal peaches. It's not like normal peaches are bad; it's just that saturn peaches evoke a smoothness you wouldn't expect.  Sylvanas is doing well. Of course, I guess it would take a lot for a labrador to not do well. She's sleeping with the wife right now, which is probably why I'm posting to a personal journal after midnight. I've tinkered for a while with work articles due in the morning, made headway, but the CMS is being frustrating. I don't have anything incredible to say right now. However, if you're reading this post, go make sure you enter the contest to win a Seagate GoFlex Satellite; I would if I weren't ineligible:  http://www.tecca.com/columns/win-your-own-seagate-goflex-satellite-from-tecca/  *If you don't get that preposterously pun: I use a tool called Posterous to maintain a micro-blog that also posts to Twitter, Facebook, and Wordpress. It would do other stuff also, but I'm perpetually in the middle of updating my "personal online brand," so I've never bothered. As the saying goes, I'm sure I'll care a lot when I'm working on my resume. Until then, updating those there is enough.

Weekend recap; Wicked, puppies, and stuff
http://writegray.posterous.com/weekend-recap-wicked-puppies-and-stuff
      http://writegray.posterous.com/weekend-recap-wicked-puppies-and-stuff




Team Gray didn't get a lot accomplished this weekend, though it was certainly an active weekend. Friday night, we just kind of turned into vegetables. We played some WoW, chilled out, and we did some house cleaning.  Saturday, however, we went into D.C. to see Wicked. The show was fantastic, inspiring, and a damned lot of fun. We grabbed some sushi, and trucked home.  The sad news for the weekend is that we found out Sylvie's day care is closing toward the end of October. This is horrible news for the hound. Sylvanas looks forward to going to day care, and she gets very excited on day care mornings. We'll probably build her a run outside, but it's not the same as seeing the team at AKK, Birdie, Dakota, and all the others.  During the "in between" bits, we did some house work, tore up some carpet, built some fencing, and other such stuff.

iMania and the future
http://writegray.posterous.com/imania-and-the-future
      http://writegray.posterous.com/imania-and-the-future




 Today at WWDC, there were some pretty big announcements; iCloud, Lion, and iOS 5. It's a lot of stuff, and I'm not trying to recap it all here. Check out Tecca for some iCloud pointers and general highlights.I've not been this pumped about Apple releases for a while. Don't get me wrong; I'm an Apple fanboi. For better or for worse, Apple products fit into my life in a smooth, easy way that the PC offering just doesn't. (And, nope, no iPad 2 here; I wouldn't hate one, but it doesn't have a role in my life.)I consider Apple a "balls deep" kind of thing, if you'll pardon the phrase. The more Apple stuff you have, the more you get out of them; the sum is greater than the parts, etc. My contacts, photos, calendars, etc. all work between my Mac, Apple TV, and iPhone very fluidly. Lion and iOS 5 (not to mention iCloud) is taking that to the next level. There's some interesting new features for folks who use "just a little" of the offering. But for people like me, the synergy between it all seems stupendous.Of course, there's a few things I'm nervous about. First, I can't help but notice (from a content writer's perspective) the way Apple is sidelining pageviews. This could actually hurt ad-funded content, though I imagine not as bad as some panic I've already seen.Second, iCloud doesn't stream it syncs. Now, I love that, because my internet connection isn't super fast, and I'm frequently offline. But the fact remains, you still need local storage.For all that iCloud is called cloud, it's really still syncing. Smooth, awesome, automagical syncing ... but syncing. I feel like the "streaming war" isn't over yet.However, as more internet provides are moving to a bandwidth cap, I guess this is still the more realistic approach. I guess we'll see, eh?

Late night chillin'
http://writegray.posterous.com/late-night-chillin
      http://writegray.posterous.com/late-night-chillin




It's about 20 to 30 minutes after my usual bed time, and I'm chilling out listening to the dryer do its thing. Somewhere between the heat, not being tired, and a restless brain, I'm not having much luck getting to sleep.
Of course, as I chill, I hear the dog barking upstairs, where my wife's trying to sleep. I think I should go tend to that ... I love my wife, and I love my dog. I'd hate to see my wife kill my dog.

No, really, I love my dog
http://writegray.posterous.com/no-really-i-love-my-dog
      http://writegray.posterous.com/no-really-i-love-my-dog

Last night as an unseasonably cool night, so we tried sleeping with the windows open. For the first time in her adult life, the Dark Puppy heard crickets and other spring night-life as she was trying to sleep.Like any good high-strung hound, she barked at them. A lot.Around 1AM, I gave up and took her downstairs so that Kat could sleep. Turned out, she was hungry. I got to sleep around 3AM. If you think sharing a bed with a labrador leaves little room on the mattress, try sharing a couch.

Stop me if you heard this one ...
http://writegray.posterous.com/stop-me-if-you-heard-this-one
      http://writegray.posterous.com/stop-me-if-you-heard-this-one




 So, last night, as Kat and I were winding down our day, preparing to turn in our day's articles, getting ready for raid, talking about dinner (you know, normal stuff), I stepped on a carpet tile, and it felt damp. We immediately had that sinking feeling. For the fourth time (fifth? we lose track), our basement flooded. This was by far not the worst flood, but still. So we've pulled up all the carpet tile (again), moved stuff out of the way (again), towelled up as much water as we could (again) ... only to find out the water has gone under the laminate flooring.My good buddy Jim rushed over with his wetvac (we're currently sans wetvac), and helped us suck up the worst of the water. Now, we have the dehumidifier running for all it's worth.The sourceThe unique thing about this flood is that we were able to indisputably track down the source. It was the spigot that leads to the outside hose, spewing water inside the cinder blocks that make up the basement wall. The leak is neither completely apparent inside the house or outside the house. Instead, it's splashing inside the cinder blocks and finding its way inside.Still, probably a little more than half the water from the garden hose got spewed into the basement.The resolutionPlumber's coming by today to fix the pipe. It'll involve cutting out some copper piping, and replacing it all. We blew open a hole in the drywall, which we'll need to close up. And then we keep dehumidifying for all we're worth, trying to make the basement an arid desert.The reason for that is that a lot of the water got under the flooring. We can't get to it without pulling up the laminate, which we can not do without completely wrecking the flooring. So, we keep dehumidifying and hoping that the water dries without turning into mildew and mold.If it turns into mildew and mold, we'll have to refloor. This time around, I'm pondering going for a tile floor instead of laminate. Laminate is much more comfortable under foot, but prone to these mishaps.This is at least the fourth or fifth flood down here. The initial issue happened twice or three times, then water system went off twice, and now this. I'm starting to feel like our basement really wants to be a swimming pool.

A year's introspection herein ...
http://writegray.posterous.com/a-years-introspection-herein
      http://writegray.posterous.com/a-years-introspection-herein




 I just came from a few hours of working on the yard. Nothing incredibly fancy; it's just that the front part of our land was in definite need of attention before rain began again. Between being awfully busy for the last few weeks, and consistent rain and sunshine mix,  it was getting a little jungle-like out there.I ran into a little trouble this week with an online community that I'd once belonged to. (That sentence was poorly constructed; my bad.) Nothing worth getting into, but just a spot of disappointment. I hadn't thought of it all day until I realized, as I was tucking my wheelbarrow beneath the "open air shed," that I hadn't thought of it all day. The trouble's not worth getting into, but that realization is significant to me.How things beganIn January 2010, Kat and I got married and moved to the country. We're not the only one of our friends to head away from the city, but Kat and I went country. We'd bought a plot of land on the side of South Mountain with a rambler, three sheds, and something like three or four acres. So, it's not a lot of land, but it's a big enough yard to keep a pair of city-folk busy learning what to do with it.Since moving out here, we've had a few the standard trouble that comes with any life. A few medical challenges, a basement flooded to the point that we had to tear out the walls and replace them, etc. etc. It's been a pretty year.More significant life changes include the dog and our work. Sylvanas has now been with us for about a year, and is very much part of the family. She's with me or Kat 24/7, except when I put her in daycare so I can work in peace for the day. Even now, she's laying on the rug near me taking a nap.Chantix and going insaneIn late 2010, I did two things at once. I quit smoking, using Chantix. That was a mistake. I rolled the dice poorly, and was one of those people who had serious, serious side-effects. I perceived the existence of children that Kat and I never had, to the point that there's a room in the house I never go into. Even being off the drug for months, I can still remember the kids clearly. I had real challenges with the lines between "reality" and "make believe."I don't discuss the Chantix time a lot, because I was crazy. Like fugbuck nuts. I'm not real proud of it. I still have nightmares, and still have moments where I must stop and ask myself "did this really happen?" Much less frequently than when I was on the drug, but often enough that it comes up.I quit smoking, but I'm not sure it was worth it.Change of workThe other thing I did in 2010 was give up my day job. I'd worked for VetCentric for nearly 11 years, missing that mark by just a few months. While I loved my time at VetCentric, and was proud of my history, experience, and successes there, it was time to move. I grew up dreaming of being a writer living on a mountain. Well, I was living on a mountain, time to be a writer.I picked up a number of freelance opportunities, and proceeded to give it my best shot. The most important lesson I learned from all of that is that I should have given myself more time to learn.I went from a regimented salary, in-office job to trying to figure out how to balance work, life, and multiple jobs. Six months into it now, I feel like I'm doing better. But at the time, I was definitely "drinking from the fire hose." I probably should have just stuck with one or two until I had things down pat. I owe Liz, Adam, Lisa, and Dan (especially those four, anyway, but really I mean all of my coworkers) a deep debt for helping me navigate and learn to live the freelance lifestyle.My perspective nowA year and a half later, living on the side of the mountain, I take some perspective of my life. I'm a decently successful writer, even if not a novelist. I've been published widely enough to feel professional, and I make a living at it. My opportunities are growing, not dwindling.I'm too busy to get caught up in stuff that used to bother me. I just can't get stressed about ephemeral things. I get frustrated, that's human, but I can't quite summon rage like I used to while living in the city. I don't have anything at stake anymore that forces me to worry. Hell, my only life concern is to make sure I'm doing a good job, and to try and help my wife get to the same place.So while I had a spot of trouble, I just couldn't get emotionally invested. It is what it is. I wrote someone I respected with my side of the story, because I do still care a bit about my reputation. And that's all there is to it; that hoofafa won't affect that Sylvie needs to be taken for a walk, I have lots of work to keep me busy. And lord knows, my current employers wouldn't complain if I'd write more.So things are good. It disappoints me to hear folks might not be happy with me, but I'm fairly solid that I've always made the best choices for people around me. I'm learning Scrivener to see if it might not help me finish this novel sometime this month, I'm busy with work, and Kat and I are doing great. (We'd like to be thinner, certainly, but even Alan wants to do that.)I wish the best for everyone. Pursue your dreams. And if you think I can help you get there, do please let me know. I'd like to be able to help you with that, just as I'd like to believe that if you could me, you would.I'll close with a picture of the hound, because I've not done that yet today.

The dog's back in daycare, and a funny photo series

      http://writegray.posterous.com/the-dogs-back-in-daycare-and-a-funny-photo-se




 Sylvanas went back to daycare this morning, thank the Light. She is feeling much, much better and is more or less back to her old self. So, back to Animal Kingdom she goes. It's a good thing for me because I've been slowly losing my mind trying to work around her. And it's a great thing for her. She obviously has been missing it badly, and has been visibly sad even as she's getting more and more hyper.Of course, we needed the dog for a picture yesterday. Check out the funny series of photographs at the link and scroll forward:https://picasaweb.google.com/museforhire/201105#5605537305599460690Never had so much trouble getting her to nom a stick before, I swear.At any rate, I'll be a little quiet for the next day or so while I desperately get caught up on the bajillion tasks that fell behind while I was playing doggy nursemaid.a

 It's solid proof that you can trust your dog when you straddle her back, force her head up, drop a pill in, then hold her mouth shut until she swallows ... and it never cross your mind she might even nibble you for your effort.

I think I can exhale now ...
http://writegray.posterous.com/i-think-i-can-exhale-now
      http://writegray.posterous.com/i-think-i-can-exhale-now

The last month and a half or so has been crazy. I've talked about it before and there's no point in rehashing. After this weekend, we're thinking we can finally breathe a bit.-- Renters are secured for the condo, that's done-- The condo work (painting, patching, et al) is done-- Have a reasonable quote for the carpet work-- Most importantly, puppy is doing well.Puppy has to stay home with me for the next week or two. That's going to make working a little difficult, and I may find myself unable to do my normal evening activites (instead, working overnight when Kat can watch the dog.) We'll see how it goes.The house is a mess right now, which is no surprise considering how much we've been focused on the condo, funerals, the dog, etc. If I can't sit to work with the puppy, though, cleaning is a reasonable way to spend time.

Sylvie's home! Update herein.
http://writegray.posterous.com/sylvies-home-update-herein
      http://writegray.posterous.com/sylvies-home-update-herein




 Well, the Dark Puppy is home. She's spent the last many hours on IVs and sub-c medicine, and is acting like her old self. They were never able to completely nail down the presence of an obstruction, it seems more likely that she somehow got extremely ulcerated.I'll be spending the next two weeks playing nursemaid. She has three medications she takes at different times three times a day each ... that's 9 doses. She has to eat small amounts food four times a day. She can't go to daycare or take part in many of her other activites ... no exercise for at least a week. This is going to be interesting.She's already trying to tear the house apart looking for food, so I need to spend an immense amount of time making sure there's *nothing* she can get into. She's not eaten since Wednesday afternoon, so she's very hungry and finding every crumb. This will be a wrestling match.As for Kat and I, we're obviously tired. I slept only 3 hours in the last two days, and she's only had a little more of a nap than that. We both missed a day of work (I'll have to get caught up), and we're not sure how to swing weekend plans: Sylvie can't be left alone.But at the end of the day (which is now), we have our puppy home and it looks like things might be okay. She was very happy to be home, and that makes it worth it.

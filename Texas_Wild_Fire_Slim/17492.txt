At the height of last week’s frenzy of speculation, argumentation, 
insinuation and accusation over the possibilities of a Liberal-NDP 
merger, I half expected to see the headline: “Opposition divided over 
unity.” Not only were the parties no closer to agreeing on a merger than
 at any time in the past: the suggestion seemed if anything more likely 
to divide each of the parties in two.
Those who dream of uniting the “progressive” vote under a single 
party should take heed. The premise that there is a natural 
anti-Conservative majority just waiting to be consolidated may appear to
 make arithmetic sense—the Conservatives having obtained just less than 
40 per cent of the vote in the last election—but rests upon a misreading
 of politics, of history, and of human nature. Whether we are talking 
about the parties themselves, or their support in the electorate at 
large, this is a case where two and two sum to a good deal less than 
four.
The voters first. The assumption underlying the merger argument is 
that the votes of the two parties can simply be added together. This 
assumes, in turn, not only that the two have more in common than divides
 them—that their voters really do vote against the Conservatives, rather
 than for either party—but also that each party’s supporters 
could be herded obediently into the merger corral. It assumes, in other 
words, both that voters have no particular loyalty to either party, and that they are so loyal as to remain in the fold even after both have been extinguished.

The reality is rather different. Assuming you could cobble together a
 merger—more on that below—the resulting mélange would be almost certain
 to alienate two groups of voters: those on the NDP left, and those on 
the Liberal right. As the NDP are the more ideologically coherent party,
 and as they are more likely, as the stronger of the two, to see 
themselves in the merged party’s reflection, the greater bleeding of 
support may be expected to occur on the right.
This is the fundamental fallacy of the merger case: the assumption 
that the Liberals are, like the NDP, a party of the left; that their 
differences with the NDP are of degree, rather than of kind. But that is
 not true of many in the party, and it is even less true among the 
universe of possible Liberal voters, many of whom think of themselves as
 centrists, even centre-right.
The chief beneficiary of a merger between the Liberals and the NDP, 
then, is likely to be the Conservatives. This is one of the axioms of 
political science. Where three parties are consolidated into two, the 
result is unlikely to be a permanent imbalance in support: rather, the 
two remaining parties tend to converge on the median voter. So the more 
probable post-merger scenario would see Conservative support expand 
toward 50 per cent.
An instructive example is presented by the collapse of the British 
Liberal Party a century ago. As Liberal support imploded, support for 
the Labour Party, it is true, grew. But so did Conservative support: 
from 38 per cent in 1922 to 48 per cent in 1935. The Conservative Party 
won four of six elections in that period of consolidation, and four of 
eight through the ensuing 35 years of two-party politics.
All of this, of course, assumes that a merger could even be put into 
effect. But whatever the reluctance of voters to follow the logic of 
merger proponents, it would be double that among each party’s rank and 
file, and twice again as much among party officials. Leave aside the 
vast doctrinal differences between, say, a Frank McKenna and the NDP. 
Ideological conflicts are subject to mediation and compromise. Historic 
hatreds are not.
Political parties, it is often remarked, are like tribes, or gangs, 
built on blood and battle. They are the accumulated inheritance of 
ancient loyalties—and ancient enmities. The people who devote their 
lives to electing Liberals and New Democrats not only have no history of
 working together, they have a long history of working against each 
other. Corporate mergers often fail for the same reason.
But doesn’t the merger of the Canadian Alliance and Progressive 
Conservatives prove it can be done? Yes—if the project is to put back 
together a coalition that had already been in existence for 120-odd 
years. Whatever electoral success the merged entity has enjoyed, 
moreover, has come at the cost of virtually everything that either party
 had ever stood for.
Is there no case for a merger, then? Yes, but it’s a rather different
 one than its proponents intend. That is, a merger might be of some 
value precisely because it divided the Liberals (and perhaps the NDP) in
 two. The orphaned right-wing Liberals, instead of joining the 
Conservatives, might elect to form a new party, with some hope of 
attracting free-market Tories, disillusioned by their party’s new-found 
taste for big government and always uneasy at sharing a political bed 
with the social conservatives. Such an alliance of social liberals and 
free marketers—call it the Social Market party—might also attract many 
Green voters.
We should then be left with three or perhaps four parties, from 
unreconstructed socialists to devout theo-cons, with distinct 
centre-left and centre-right options in between: surely a more 
appetizing menu for voters than two barely coherent puddles of mush.

Given the sorry state of the current Liberal party, it's time to close the books on this one. The Libs don't have any direction, they can't make up their minds whether they are just right of center, or far left; the party is decaying from within, destroyed by lack of unity and power struggles, and can no longer gain the support of many Canadians. It's time for their individual members to throw their support behind the NDP, which, at this time is the only party with credibility. Maybe in another generation, a new, focused, Liberal party may emerge, but for now, they are just an unnecessary distraction and waste of votes.

Maybe it's time we had a military coup in this country, get rid of our dominant dictator ( reminds me of Joseph Stalin) and got this country back on track as a peace keeping country and not a war mongering country like our neighbors south of us. No wonder we are getting a bad rep in this world. We have a leader with absolute power something akin to Irans leadership. But history will prevail and the people will eventually rise against the tyrant Harper as they are doing in the middle east and we as a country can get on to being a great country that we can be.

They need a good leader to convince both parties that a merger is better for Canada. In the coming four years, they'll see the need to merge.

Bob Rae has doubts about Turmel? Wait a second....Bob Rae is a turncoat, who jumped over to the Liberal party from the NDP. NDP voters lost respect for Bob Rae. Go, Bob Go!!

the Liberal party are elitists, and are detached from middle class Canadians. Look at the "Free Trade" disaster  that Cretien inked in the early 90's with Communist China. Thousands of Canadian manufacturing jobs gone- Poof-Gone!!  forever. NDP is the only party that cares about our schools, hospitals and middle class. Maybe the Conservatives and Liberals should merge.

It would save Canadian taxpayers money if the Federal Liberals and Federal NDP were laid off. Stephen  "THE MAN", Harper got a majority government. Canada needs to be cleaned up and cleaned out, deficits and debt need to be gone. Stephen needs to get us back in the black. He needs to wean people off the taxpayer bottle. He needs to make it plain to our professionals that the Canadian taxpayers are not pawns. He knows that monopolies in healthcare need to be broken to bring about more accessible health care. Federal Liberals, Federal NDP, take a holiday, Stephen Harpers has got a job to do , and he is just the man who can do it ! "Go Stephen Go" !

Exposure wise you'd think the Liberals were the opposition party or the governing party having a nervous breakdown. They only have 34 seats to 269. 

Why is the media doing the Liberals so many big favors? Give us a break and stop clobbering us. It's getting grotesque with old and rotting war horses being dragged out of the proverbial political graveyard by the media, especially by the maudlin CBC. Nothing else to do? No real new news just pathetic fear, uncertainty and disbelief from under the big red tent? You have 4 more years to go. As far as style goes, is this never going to end? It's so bloody boring which is why the Liberals with their panache was booted out. After mayor Ford's win and the likelihood of a Hudek one, life will get interesting again.

Apparently the NDP have 85k+/- fed party members vs 125k+/- for the LPC. 

Considering bed mates, I worry about the NDP. The Liberals will maul, they'll skin alive and rape the NDP. Worrying about the Liberals is a waste of time because they're irrational and abnormal power hungry weasels, whereas the NDP are just trying to compensate for their inherent limitations. That would be like uniting sociopaths with the depressives. A merger unites the icky S side from both parties with the yucky M side of both parties just because they won't vote Conservative. And the suits will be forced to walk because how much can their pockets take or watch of the apes running the new zoo party?

Lets not forget, in 4 years time we will have seen 8 years of Harper rule over some of the worst economic times Canada has ever seen.  Conservatives will be rewarded with a boot in the rear as we will have come to hate them with a passion.

Instant-runoff voting

The prospect of a merger would not have to happen if we only elected politicians with instant-runoff voting. Check it out on Wikipedia for more detail. Basically you rank the politicians in your riding. If no politician gets 50% of the vote, then the politician with the lowest number of votes is eliminated and the people who voted for that person - their second choice is used, and so on until one politician has 50%. It is the way that the parties elect their leaders, so why not for us voters.

Instead of politics than are tainted by patronage appointments, croneyism, nepotism, payoffs, bribes and self interest,how about a new centrist party that promotes the well being of this country, culturally and fiscally?
ALL the major federal parties have committed  sleazy deals away from the public eye. Both Liberals and Conservatives have spoken to the accountability of persons in public service, yet civil servants view and download porn on our dime, a former PM's takes a bribe and is not charged, and MP's manipulate and redirect public money to suit personal agendas. Why can't persons looking after the public's affairs be accountable? This country needs new options, preferably injected with honesty.

The Liberals and NDP must merge if for no other reason than to make this topic go away.

The can call it the New D&D Party (NDDP), as in the "New Dumb and Dumber Party".

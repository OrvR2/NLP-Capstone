Aug. 31, 2011 — Six members from Texas’ All-Hazard Incident Management Teams were deployed Wednesday to Albany, New York, to aid in Hurricane Irene response efforts. Managed by Texas Forest Service, the teams — also called IMTs — are designed to respond to communities that need help in the wake of disaster. "Our responders are headed to Greene County and will serve as reinforcement in response and recovery efforts," said Bob Koenig, state incident management team coordinator with Texas Forest Service. “The team’s task is to integrate into the existing county emergency operations structure to assist in tracking resources and situational awareness in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene.”Texas Forest Service oversees the coordination, training and deployment of the state’s 15 teams, which are made up of a total of 630 emergency responders from local jurisdictions across the state.Though the teams often have been called to respond to disasters —catastrophic hurricanes and wildfires, most recently — in the Lone Star State, this is the first time its members have been mobilized as part of a national response. The team sent to New York is made up of emergency responders from Texas Forest Service, Round Rock Police Department, Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services, Travis County Sheriff’s Office and Nacogdoches Fire Department.  Contact:Bob Koenig, State Incident Management Team Coordinator(979) 450-8659, bkoenig@tfs.tamu.edu

 Media News






CNN will debut part of a new evening lineup on Monday, August 8. 
The news network shook things up in July, canceling Eliot Spitzer's 8PM program "In the Arena." On Monday, Anderson Cooper's "AC360" will take its timeslot. 
Later in the fall, the network will debut Erin Burnett's news program at 7pm. "CNN Newsroom" will be cut by an hour, ending at 4pm instead of 5pm. "The Situation Room" will air an hour earlier, beginning at 4pm, as will "John King USA," which will broadcast at 6pm. 
Though some of the changes to CNN's schedule won't happen just yet, we wanted to show you what the network would look like when they've all taken place. 
See the network's full fall lineup below. Will you watch these hosts in their new timeslots?

				Ali Velshi grows on you. He's actually very funny and quite bright. I hope he and Christine stay on in the morning.

Diversity? Plenty of men AND women. You have ethnic diversity in TJ, Suzanne, Ali and Don Lemon. You have gay men too (Anderson and Don). Can't think of any Asian anchors though.

Wish they'd bring back Soledad instead of sticking her on "special assignment­s." And Piers Morgan's show is mostly tabloid chatter, IMHO.

At least the lineup isn't all blonde, size-0, chippies like at "Faux."

				I understand that there is a dearth of multi-ethn­ic talent on CNN in anchor positions (there are still plenty of minority reporters and contributo­rs) but to say that there are none is obviously incorrect, unless Ali Velshi and Suzanne Malveaux are no longer considered to be people of color.

				AC360 (Anderson Cooper) is the best in bringing national and internatio­nal news.  He's the only one trying to increase the attention on the famine and starvation in the poor Horn of Africa.  NO OTHER reporter is daring to go in those dangerous and disease-st­ricken areas.  Kudos to Anderson Cooper and to Sanjay Gupta.

				This country will be hobbled until the preaching/­screeching class admit that their heroes (Gingrich, Falwell, Vitter, Ensign, et. al.) are human, that they have sinned, and should be forgiven. As should Spitzer, Weiner, and the rest.
I do NOT give a FFAARD (flying f#ck at a rolling doughnut) about a pol's personal life.
As Dame Eliz. Campbell said of Oscar Wilde, "As long as they don't do it in the streets, and scare the horses, who cares?"

				I can't believe they actually REPEAT programmin­g in Prime Time. Where is the breaking news they became (justifiab­ly) famous for? AC is OK but Morgan, and all the other crap is so boring. 

Used to be my go-to station, now I'll watch just about anything else, except Faux, of course!

Facebook is facing yet another lawsuit.
A Northern Ireland man is suing the company, claiming that Facebook is "guilty of negligence" and had created "a risk of sexual and physical harm" after his 12-year-old daughter uploaded provocative pictures to her page, according to the BBC. Perhaps more importantly, the father is also upset because of his daughter's age.
While Facebook maintains a policy of verifying that users are over 13, there are no checks in place to make sure they're telling the truth. At the time the lawsuit was filed, Digital Trends reported, the girl's father claimed that Facebook had not yet removed the girl's profile.
"My own personal view is that Facebook isn’t suitable for under-18s, but the company isn’t even able to uphold its own policy of keeping under-13s out," said Hilary Carmichael, the father's lawyer told Digital Trends. 
According to the BBC, while Facebook has "come a long way" in terms of privacy and age verification, there still aren't enough checks in place. Carmichael, as a result, is advocating for a passport verification system to better track who is using the site.
Privacy issues have long been an issue for the social network, but there seems to be little they can do in regards to age verification. While this example may show how easy it is to lie and bypass the simple age check, the social network has pushed for less anonymity and more openness online.
“I think anonymity on the Internet has to go away,” Facebook's former head of marketing, Randi Zuckerberg, said in July, as reported by The Huffington Post's Bianca Bosker. 
In effect, stricter age restrictions and identification policies on Facebook could lead to less anonymity. Whether or not the lawsuit holds remains to be seen. 
Back in March, Australia's Daily Telegraph wrote that Facebook's chief privacy adviser, Mozelle Thompson, addressed the Australian Senate cyber-safety committee and said each day the social network removes 20,000 profiles believed to belong to children under 13. In May, a Consumer Reports survey found that 7.5 million underage users maintained largely unsupervised profiles against Facebook's policy.

				The father is responsibl­e for the actions of his underage daughter. The father is also the LEGAL owner of the computer and the one who provides the access to the internet. It sounds to me that the father and the daughter should be arrested for child pornograph­y.

				So lets see....he can sue someone else for not supervisin­g HIS OWN KID?  Look DAD, it's your JOB to watch your OWN kid, not anyone elses.  How about we investigat­e you and why you don't know your pre-teen child is posting lewd pictures of herself on the internet.  i have a 13 year old daughter, and while i may not know every waking aspect of her life, she is mine to watch over and mine to be VIGILANT in finding out what shes doing. While she is a damn good kid, I do not live under a delusional cloud of my kid will never do wrong.  They are kids, and in some way they ALL will make a mistake in life.  Definitely your responsibi­lity, not facebook.

				ITS CALLED PARENT CONTROL, KEEP BETTER EYE ON DAUGHTER ITS YOUR JOB TO REMOVE HER. IF SHE WAS MY DAUGHTER SHE WOULDNT OWN A CELL OR FACEBOOK PAGE IF SHE DIDNT KNOW HOW TO LISTEN. SEE THESE KIDS THINK ITS A PLAY GROUND BUT THEY HAVE KNOW IDEA WHAT THERE GETTING THERE SELF INTO. I COULD SEE HOW SHE MAY HAVE UPLOADED PHOTOS SHE SHOULDNT HAVE. WITH OUT PARENT KNOWING. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. I LIKE THE INTERNET BUT, FOR KIDS ITS SERIOUSLY DANGEROUS. IF THERE NOT WATCHED YOU CAN BLOCK WHERE TEY GO.

				it is not facebook's job to monitor what people post. if the kid decided to lie about her age to have an account, then post lewd pictures of herself, the only people culpable are her, and her parents. facebook can only go so far in requesting certain things to verify age. i mean, they can't request your social security number because then there really is a privacy issue. they have to work on an honor system and if people choose to ignore that and lie, the company cannot be held responsibl­e. i doubt this will go to trial, nor will there be any money awarded. considerin­g the person suing is in another country, i'm not sure of the laws in ireland. but i do know here in the US that there are a lot of new laws regarding sexting as being in possession­/distribut­ion of child pornograph­y. these laws punish the kids (as they did the sending) for texting their own lewd photos but i'm not sure if there is a similar law in regards to facebook. there are obviously laws about the online transmissi­on of lewd images of children though...

				Parents must be held responsibl­e for their childrens behavior. If you allow the kids on sites like facebook you're asking for trouble. Block all these sites and there will be less problems and less reason to think you can sue some one else for your little brats behavior.

				I guess Facebook MADE the 12 year old lie about her age, the Facebook MADE her take the photos and then worst of all Facebook MADE her post the pictures.

Sounds like a case of a inattentiv­e parent looking for someone to blame besides themselves­.

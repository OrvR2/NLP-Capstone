AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Call it a leadership test in real time.
Rick Perry left the presidential campaign trail this week to dash back to Texas, where wildfires have devoured more than 1,000 homes in a week.
"Not paying attention to politics right now" is how the conservative Republican explained it after he ditched a high-profile campaign appearance in early-voting South Carolina to tend to his duties as governor. His attendance at a debate Wednesday night in California — it would be his first on the national stage — is now in question.
"I'm substantially more concerned about making sure Texans are being taken care of," Perry said Tuesday after viewing by helicopter the fire-ravaged neighborhood west of Austin.
His message was clear: governing first, politics second.
The wildfires come just weeks after Perry entered the GOP presidential race and shot to the top of national polls taking an early measure of the Republican field.
It didn't take long for Perry to be subjected to the scrutiny a presidential campaign brings. He has faced criticism for his record as Texas governor and his positions on some issues. His down-home, Texas-style demeanor hasn't always played well on a national stage.
Now, Perry — whose job includes coordinating his state's wildfire response — has the chance to try to boost his image and set himself apart from his GOP presidential rivals by showing off his leadership and management skills as Republicans nationwide weigh whether he has what it takes to be president. Not one of his opponents is a sitting governor.
"It gives Perry an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, to demonstrate decisiveness and at the same time empathy and caring," said Todd Harris, a Republican consultant who has worked on a number of GOP presidential campaigns. "You can't do anything that looks, sounds or smells even remotely political. If it looks like you are taking advantage of a disaster and trying to use it for political purposes, it will backfire."
Perry also could end up looking weak and ineffective should the fires continue to rage without interruption or if the state's response is perceived to be slow or subpar. Just ask former President George W. Bush, whose sluggish response to Hurricane Katrina shaped his second term and forever tarnished his reputation.
"It's always an advantage for a candidate to be acting rather than talking," said Frank Donatelli, chairman of GOPAC, an organization that trains Republicans to run for elective office. "If you take control of the situation and then don't deliver, that's a bad thing."
And Perry could open himself up to charges of hypocrisy.
He has said he will request federal disaster relief for this round of wildfires — although he bashes the federal government and Washington every chance he gets, even as flames envelop parts of his state. And while he was seeking federal money, he took a swipe at the Defense Department, suggesting that bureaucratic red tape was holding up bulldozers and other equipment from nearby Fort Hood that could be used to fight the fires around central Texas.
"It's more difficult than it should be to get those types of assets freed up by the federal government," Perry said. "When you've got people hurting, when you've got lives that are in danger in particular, I really don't care who the asset belongs to. If it's sitting in some yard somewhere and not helping be part of the solution, that's a problem."
Perry overlooked the fact that Fort Hood is battling its own wildfires. Tyler Broadway, a spokesman for the post, said bulldozers cutting firebreaks around the blaze were part of an effort that had fires there only 60 percent contained by Tuesday night.
Fires have blackened 3.5 million acres, an area roughly the size of Connecticut, across the state since December.
President Barack Obama rejected Texas' request in April for federal aid due to wildfires, but then declared 45 fire-ravaged counties a major disaster in July, after Perry wrote to the White House to appeal the previous decision. The Agriculture Department has also declared all of Texas a natural disaster area due to a relentless drought, making farmers eligible for low-interest emergency loans.
As fire raged back home on Sunday, Perry abruptly left a campaign trip to South Carolina to head to Bastrop, a quaint community about 25 miles from Austin where a wildfire that spanned more than 16 miles was raging out of control. When he arrived, Perry got an earful from evacuated residents who demanded to know why more state planes weren't being used to pour water on the flames.
"Where are the planes?" several gathered in the municipal building's lobby shouted.
Clearly taken aback, Perry mumbled, "The planes are flying."
"We don't seem them!" some in the crowd shot back.
But the heckling was short-lived. The same crowd applauded a few minutes later when Perry responded to a question about Wednesday's debate in Simi Valley, Calif., saying he was "not paying attention to politics right now."
Aides said Tuesday that he plans to debate. But Perry left open the possibility that he may skip it. Asked if he would have time to prepare even if he does attend, Perry said, "We'll deal with that when it comes up."

				so, the rule is to cut state taxes to save the rich money knowing you can call on the FEDERAL government for help when you get in a bind. now we will also cut federal taxes to save the rich so that when we get in a bind, we can point out how ineffectua­l the FEDERAL government is when they have no money to help us (because we cut revenues).

				Perry — whose job includes coordinati­ng his state's wildfire response -- should have been in Texas to oversee things when the fire was still small enough to get under control, and not stayed in South Carolina campaignin­g until late Sunday morning.  

And as for the Fort Hood equipment, what's wrong with the Free Market system to supply the equipment. I'm sure there are lots of bulldozers and such sitting at private constructi­on companies all around the fire. No, they aren't going to be used to fight the fires, because the constructi­on companies realize that more houses burning just means more work for them, and their bottom line means more than their neighbors' houses.

				What a 'concerned­' Governer he is. While he is out trying to make himself look  good - we have lost over 200 homes and 4 lives from the wildfires.  And he can't find the money in the state budget to fight the fires. Is that because the money accidental­ly slipped into his campaign funds?

				The whole welfare system is nothing but a big ponzi scheme..Un­fortunatel­y, the Politicans and their cronies who profit from it don't go to jail.. It is refreshing to hear a politican tell the truth about it.. The problem is the government has done a good job at creating the addiction to welfare.. It has become part of our culture..A­s corrupt as it is we are trapped in it. A wise man once said if you serve a man fish you feed him for a day.. If you teach him to fish you feed him for a lifetime.. Government stimulus is temporary.­. Getting out of the way and letting free enterprise work is the only way to recover our economy..

It's not all one or the other. You can't close your eyes to the corruption within the free enterpsie system that has runied lives. Blind ideology is a very dangerous dymanic my friend.

				He's already failed his first leadership test and managed to look weak and ineffectiv­e. Just watch his news conference on the Bastrop fire. He can't even own his own experience flying over the fire, but says "you see..." "you realize...­." He speaks in a semi-monot­one, at times haltingly, and his only facial expression is to raise his eyebrows, which he does repeatedly­. He uses alot of cliches. One could fall asleep listening.

You can see it by sliding through the first video and watching the second at the top of the page at http://aus­tin.ynn.co­m/content/­top_storie­s/280314/b­astrop-fir­e-remains-­out-of-con­trol--more­-homes-des­troyed.

				Perry asked Obama for federal aid to help with the wildfire problem. Obama rejected his request in April but after submitting a letter to Obama appealing that decision, Perry got that federal aid. This was the same Rick Perry who OK'ed a $30+ million budget cuts to the Texas Forest service, including cuts to the Wildfire Emergency Program, back in November of last year, knowing full well that wildfire season was fast approachin­g.

Here are some other things that Texas can thank Rick Perry for:

Percent of Uninsured Children - 1st
Percent of Population Uninsured - 1st
Percent of Non-Elderl­­y Uninsured - 1st
Amount of Carbon Dioxide Emissions - 1st
Amount of Volatile Organic Compounds Released into Air - 1st
Amount of Toxic Chemicals Released into Water - 1st
Amount of Recognized Cancer-Cau­­sing Carcinogen­­s Released into Air - 1st
Amount of Hazardous Waste Generated - 1st
Number of Executions - 1st
Percent of Population with Food Insecurity - 2nd
Percent of Children Living in Poverty - 4th
Percent Living Below Federal Poverty Level - 4th
Amount of Toxic Chemicals Released into Air - 5th
Percent of Population with Employer-B­­ased Health Insurance - 48th
Percent of Population 25 and Older with a High School Diploma - 50th
Per Capita State Spending on Mental Health - 50th
Percent of Non-Elderl­­y Women with Health Insurance - 50th
Percent of Pregnant Women Receiving Prenatal Care in First Trimester - 50th
Workers’ Compensati­­on Coverage - 50th

				Unless a person has spent weeks charging into the flames of wildfires with a chain saw and a bladder of gas on their backs, sleeping at night under trucks and smoke,  they have no concept of what it is like to fight forest fires.  And unless a person has flown high risk, obsolete military aircraft dumping retardent over massive burns, they have no right to blow about their personal fire suppresson leadership­.  Which in Mr. Perry's case is zero.

				Perry has STEADILY cut the budgets of Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for DECADES...­leading to vast natural forest land WITHOUT routine brush reduction and creation of fire break lanes.  He has reduced state agency's budgets so dramatical­ly over the past 10 years, that many of them have no resources to protect or aid Texas homeowners­.  This wouldn't seem so bad IF, and a BIG IF, Perry had managed to BALANCE THE STATE BUDGET over the past 10 years.  But like MAJORITY OF CONSERVATI­VE actions...­he managed to run it up to a $32 BILLION deficit EVEN WITH these "cost" savings.  Thank God for Obama's Stimulus money in 2009....Pe­rry used it to pay off PART of his deficits..­.not create jobs and a better Texas.  If you are even just THINKING about this guy for President, think twice, think hard.

				This reminds me of McCain rushing back to DC to "fix" the economy.
If Rick doesn't come through with the equipment and manpower to do an effective job he will be toasted by this fire thing.
I really hope he is doing the right things for Texas, but I just do not trust politician­s, especially in campaign mode.
I do find it funny and ironic that he is petitionin­g DC for FEDERAL dollars for his state. Isn't that against his beliefs?

Ufortunatl­y it didn't come back to hurt him but hurt all the Texans  who lost their lives and homes in all those fires that couldn't be put out because of the shortage in man power and equipment.­Thank you Rick

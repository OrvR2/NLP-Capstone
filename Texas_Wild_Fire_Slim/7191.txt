Mel Gibson to produce movie about Jewish icon 
(CNN) – For his next project, Mel Gibson is setting his sights on a film about a Jewish hero, according to Deadline.
The embattled actor, who's come under fire for making anti-Semitic remarks, has teamed up with Warner Bros. to create a movie about Judah Maccabee, a famed warrior in Jewish history. (Warner Bros. is owned by the same parent company as CNN.)
Gibson is set to produce the film through his Icon Productions company, and will decide on whether to direct or act in the feature after the script is completed. Joe Eszterhas ("Basic Instinct," "Showgirls") is attached to pen the script, which, according to Deadline, will also have input from Gibson.

twas the ways for tribes and clans to fight over territory..there were fierce tribes and gentle tribes.The late Margaret Mead,a anthropologist wrote in her "blue berry winter"biography.This still prevails today.  everywhere

Reason
Gentle tribes unfortunately lose on the side of history, if not totally absorbed or wiped out. Your good/evil paradigm is extremely short sighted and foolish, I wish it were true but reality is quite different. Warfare is built into our genes, that is the way it is whether we like it or not.

Friend of the Jews
The Jews in the B.C. era got saved by the faith in the coming Messiah Jesus whom all the worship and sacrifice systems of Judaism  lead to, just as Christians in the A.D. era get saved by faith in Jesus. "Behold, as for the proud one, his soul is not right within him; But the righteous will live by his faith." (Habakkuk 2:4) "Abram believed the LORD, and He credited it to him as righteousness." (Genesis 15:6)

You can't be serious. Almost NO Jews were waiting for a messiah, and if they were, it was a strictly political one.

The Maccabees is part of the Catholic Bible but not part of the Jewish or Protestant Bibles, so this will be more a Catholic Biblical  story than a Jewish one. But the Maccabee story is popular among Jews

@John Mack
" But the Maccabee story is popular among Jews "
Yeah... that's definitely an understatement.  It is one of their central and core narratives.

Peace...

it's a lie just like all the other stories in the first testament. if you think some of the passages in the koran are ugly, you should read the jewish torah. the torah is filled with bigotry and hatred for everyone who is not jewish.

Since the Holocaust happened, this planet is not the same world. Something has permanently changed.

the holocaust is a lie. yes, the nazi's hated jews, but they also hated and killed far more slav's, russians, and gypsy's. jews always play the victim, but they deserve most of what happened to them through out history. jews were kicked out and banned from many countries because they operated like a mafia. they would take control of a nations economy, drain it of wealth, and subject the citizens to poverty and slave wages.

"the holocaust is a lie. yes, the nazi's hated jews, but they also hated and killed far more slav's, russians, and gypsy's"
Whether or not the nazi's killed more groups of others that they disliked has -0- bearing on the realities of the horror's not only done to those mentioned, and of course the 7 million jews that were killed.
So, I think your comment that "the holocaust is a lie" is really ridiculous.
" they deserve most of what happened to them through out history. "
And... now you are sounding pretty anti-semitic here.  "They deserved what happened to them"...? Really...?
I would suggest some possible re-thinking of your askew world-view.
Peace...

When Hollywood runs out of movie ideas, they can always get something Jewish and tell the world how serious they are, after all.

Treatment of Israel will determine whether China will be a good guy or a bad guy on earth. No amount of Christian presence will change that standard. Chinese should stop abusing zoo animals and eating all the weird stuff( unless they are starving in that region). China should get some Jewish diet if she really wants to beat the West.

Summary of the drama in Planet Earth:
Jews or Israel = the main character
All other races or nations: beneficiaries of Israel, helpers(good guys), mobs, villains 
Jewish-themed works are good; it's always planet-deep, never local. But who'd imagine the Chinese Christians would reach Jerusalem? Wonders are never exhausted in this planet.

The Maccabees didn't fight the Romans. They fought the Seleucid Empire, one of the portions of Alexander's empire, and the Hellenized Jews.

Reality
If you believe the following conclusions by 1.5 million Conservative Jews and their rabbis, then there are some much larger issues than M. Gibson and J. Maccabee.
origin: http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20E1EFE35540C7A8CDDAA0894DA404482 NY Times
New Torah For Modern Minds 
âAbraham, the Jewish patriarch, probably never existed. Nor did Moses. The entire Exodus story as recounted in the Bible probably never occurred. The same is true of the tumbling of the walls of Jericho. And David, far from being the fearless king who built Jerusalem into a mighty capital, was more likely a provincial leader whose reputation was later magnified to provide a rallying point for a fledgling nation. 
Such startling propositions - the product of findings by archaeologists digging in Israel and its environs over the last 25 years - have gained wide acceptance among non-Orthodox rabbis. But there has been no attempt to disseminate these ideas or to discuss them with the laity - until now. 
The United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, which represents the 1.5 million Conservative Jews in the United States, has just issued a new Torah and commentary, the first for Conservatives in more than 60 years. Called "Etz Hayim" ("Tree of Life" in Hebrew), it offers an interpretation that incorporates the latest findings from archaeology, philology, anthropology and the study of ancient cultures. To the editors who worked on the book, it represents one of the boldest efforts ever to introduce into the religious mainstream a view of the Bible as a human rather than divine doc-ument. 
The notion that the Bible is not literally true "is more or less settled and understood among most Conservative rabbis," observed David Wolpe, a rabbi at Sinai Temple in Los Angeles and a contributor to "Etz Hayim." But some congregants, he said, "may not like the stark airing of it." Last Passover, in a sermon to 2,200 congregants at his synagogue, Rabbi Wolpe frankly said that "virtually every modern archaeologist" agrees "that the way the Bible describes the Exodus is not the way that it happened, if it happened at all." The rabbi offered what he called a "LITANY OF DISILLUSIONâ' about the narrative, including contradictions, improbabilities, chronological lapses and the absence of corroborating evidence. In fact, he said, archaeologists digging in the Sinai have "found no trace of the tribes of Israel - not one shard of pottery."

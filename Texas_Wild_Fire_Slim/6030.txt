In advance of Wilco's upcoming Sept. 27 album, The Whole Love, frontman Jeff Tweedy told the Atlantic all about the resourceful way he wrote one of its songs, "Born Alone":
I wasn't coming up with anything specific, so I opened up a book of American poetry and randomly turned to the Emily Dickinson pages, no one poem in particular. I took a lot of words, most of them verbs, and put them against words that looked appealing to me from Whittier and other 1800s poetry. It's just looking at the words and writing a little poem trying to use as many of them as possible. If I'm lucky it all starts to settle meter-wise on the melody I have in my head, and then a certain amount of tweaking goes on to coax out a little more feeling. It's an exciting way to write, without trying to steer the ship in any one direction.

In semi-related breaking news: Tweedy covered The Black Eyed Peas' "I Gotta Feeling" with some real verve at the Rahm Emanuel dirty tweet party last night. We've got the sun-drenched music video for "Born Alone," and footage of Tweedy saying "do it" over and over again below:

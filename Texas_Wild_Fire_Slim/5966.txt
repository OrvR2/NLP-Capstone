Ron Paul is our best hope to return to a Republic form of government. A medium of exchange cannot be something printable, non-intrinsic, of no physical value.

Hoffa and Obama, two Chicago thugs who could care less about America....it's all about them and the money they can control. Better wake up America!

also computers made it easy to forge Obamas birth certificate,   but  they did not do a good job of it.

Just reading most of these comments on Yahoo News stories...People seriously have no #$%$ clue what they are talking about when it comes to politics. Everyone just needs to shut the hell up and actually learn about the government, history, politics, and how things run in this country. People need to stop pulling #$%$ out of their asses.One thing pissing me off: STOP POKING AT OBAMA AND CLAIMING HIM AS THE CAUSE OF THE RECESSION He is the friggin president! He doesn't control our economy to a great extent whatsoever! Look at congress if you want to poke criticisms about our economy. Leave Obama alone and let him do THE JOB HE IS HIRED TO DO.

Remember the press photos of the so called "racist tea party" photos of the gun toting (supposedly white guy)  that uncropped was actually a black guy carrying the gun!! Just another example of DISHONEST liberal reporting!!

It's funny, but the most famous altered photos of all time wern't mentioned: The JFK autopsy photos taken at Bethesda Naval Hospital, the night of November 22, 1963. Funny, isn't it!

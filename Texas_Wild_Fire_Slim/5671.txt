JAKARTA (Reuters) - Seven dogs starved of food and water for two weeks are suspected of eating their Indonesian owner after he returned to his hometown in Manado from a holiday, local media reported on Tuesday.
A neighborhood guard was curious when he saw luggage lined up at the front of Andre Lumboga's house, days after the 50-year old arrived back home. He approached the house, smelled something foul and called the police, according to a report.
"His skull was found in the kitchen, and his body was found in the front of his house," Eriyana, a local police chief in Batam, an island off Sumatra, told VIVAnews website.
Lumboga arrived home last Wednesday, but his body was just discovered on Monday.
"We suspect that the dogs were hungry, so they attacked Andre, because they had not been fed for 14 days," he said. Police also found bones of two other dogs, believed to have also been eaten by the hungry canines.
Lumboga was from northern Sulawesi island, a predominantly Christian area, where the local spicy diet is famous in Indonesia for including dogs, bats and forest rats.

As a animal lover...I feel no pity for anyone who for any human that would leave a child or animal alone for a day much less 1-2 weeks got exactly what he deserved!!! Hopefully it was a long SLOW painful death! If you don't want a child or animal let some one who will love and take care of them do so! The SPCA would gladly no longer have to exist!!!

Dogs are dangerous animals. I hate them... Dog owners all think their dog would never bite until someone gets hurt. Dogs should be banned.

O.K: The guy that's looking for bear in Yellowstone has another, like job right here and i set it up the same way due to the fact it appears to be a new requirement, me telling the truth and you ignoring me: THERE ARE NO DOGS OF ANY KIND IN INDONESIA. Those people make Scrooge look like the Easter Bunny. They wouldn't keep animals, period. Somebody made it look like a dog attack.

Guess that will teach the S.O.B. to feed his dogs. Any fool that closes a bunch of dogs up for two weeks without feed or water should know what would happen when he went back to them.

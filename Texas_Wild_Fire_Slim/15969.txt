[Federal agencies seize control on Tuesday] Hundreds of firefighters from all the surrounding counties worked two days and nights in a heroic effort to contain the fires, but high winds Sunday night and all day Monday thwarted their efforts. So the call went out for more volunteer firefighters to join the effort from across the state. Before they arrived, however, the federal government showed up and claimed it was in charge of the situation. "Agents with the federal National Interagency Fire Center, a coalition of federal agencies including the US Forest Service, assumed command of firefighting efforts Tuesday afternoon," reports The Gonzales Cannon (www.gonzalescannon.com RealNewsReporter.com is now reporting that volunteer firefighters who had in some cases driven all night to reach Bastrop county were turned away by the feds, who claimed that since local officials never made a "formal request" for volunteers, the volunteers could not be "activated." So while Bastrop County burns from 40+ fires that are still raging, the federal government is actually telling volunteer firefighters to go home. "We were at the station getting set up into strike teams, and this guy came up and said that the US Forest Service had 'assumed control of the situation, and that If you don't have a vehicle that squirts water, go home,' said Gordon Greer of Kirbyville, in a RealNewsReporter article (www.realnewsreporter.com Gordon reportedly drove all night Monday to arrive in Bastrop and take <b>...</b>

This Wild fire was burning in Cedar Creek Texas Bastrop County off Union Chapel. When I started shooting this video of the brush fire it was about ten minutes till noon. Watch at minute 7:13 and you can see the planes fly over head and drop that fire retardant right in front of me. I do not know what happened to the sound. The Bluebonnet Electric worker that came to the scene after me informed me that the fire could break the power-lines over head and create a larger danger... Also notice all the guys saving their FISHING BOATS FROM THE FIRE, now there are some people who have their priorities straight!!! One guy passed the cop ignoring her ... then he came out of the fire a couple minutes later with the BOAT!!

The Bastrop fire raged on today. Then fires began showing up only 4 miles from us in Cedar Creek onHighway 71. Luckily we are up wind. It is incredibly sad to see so many folks burned out, animals displaced or worse and so much land destroyed. Chris and other River Crossing neighbors took in numerous horses from evacuated areas.

Inside The Historic Bastrop, TX Wildfire - 9/6/11

Order: Reorder
Duration: 2:06
Published: 2011-09-07
Author: alabamastormspotters


One of the most devastating wildfire outbreaks in Texas history left more than 1000 homes in ruins Tuesday and stretched the state's firefighting ranks to the limit, confronting Gov. Rick Perry with a major disaster at home just as the GOP presidential contest heats up. More than 180 fires have erupted in the past week across the rain-starved Lone Star State, and nearly 600 of the homes destroyed since then were lost in one catastrophic blaze in and around Bastrop, near Austin, that raged out of control Tuesday for a third day. Whipped into an inferno by Tropical Storm Lee's winds over the weekend, the blaze burned more than 45 square miles, forced the evacuation of thousands and killed at least two people, bringing the overall death toll from the outbreak to at least four. "We lost everything," said Willie Clements, whose two-story colonial home in a housing development near Bastrop was reduced to a heap of metal roofing and ash. A picket fence was melted. Some goats and turkeys survived, but about 20 chickens and ducks were burned to death in a coop that went up in flames.

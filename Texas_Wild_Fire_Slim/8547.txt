3 Guard members killed in Nevada IHOP rampageBy SANDRA CHEREB - Associated Press | AP – 18 hrs ago

CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Residents of a sleepy state capital say they woke up Wednesday to a small town that's lost its innocence after a mass shooting in an IHOP restaurant that left four people and the shooter dead and injured seven others.Just before 9 a.m. Tuesday, gunman Eduardo Sencion stepped onto the Carson City pancake house parking lot from his blue minivan with a yellow "Support Our Troops" sticker on it.He opened fire, then continued into the restaurant and marched toward a table of uniformed National Guard members before shooting each one, and fatally wounding three of them, authorities said.Officials planned to release information about the victims Wednesday as the search for a motive — and a time of grieving — continue."Our hearts ache for all the victims of this senseless act of violence," IHOP Restaurants President Jean Birch wrote on Facebook after coming to town in the aftermath of the breakfast-time massacre. "The people of Carson City have also shown incredible support for the victims and IHOP's team members."Lawmakers, business owners and law enforcement officials in this close-knit, government-driven city of 50,000 struggled to understand what drove Sencion to turn an AK-47 assault rifle on his hometown."It's unprecedented in Carson City history," said Guy Rocha, retired Nevada state archivist. "People who live in Carson City have come from other places to get away from the large urban madness. ... It finally came to Carson City.Authorities are investigating whether the military members were targeted. Carson City Sheriff Kenny Furlong told The Associated Press on Tuesday night that authorities, at that point, did not think the shooter set out to target people in military."But of course, it's clearly a heavy, heavy concern from here," he added.Sencion shot each of the five Nevada National Guard troops sitting together at the back of the restaurant. Another woman was shot and killed.Family members told investigators that Sencion, 32, was mentally troubled, but he did not have a criminal history. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital hours after the mass shooting."The sheriff may never know the motive," Nevada Highway Patrol spokesman Chuck Allen said.The shooting started just before 9 a.m. roughly two miles from the state Capitol in Carson City.Sencion stepped out of the minivan and immediately shot a woman near a motorcycle before charging into the chain restaurant. Witnesses said he had unloaded a magazine when he was still less than 12 feet from his car.The gunfire prompted Ralph Swagler, the owner of a nearby barbecue restaurant, to grab his weapon. But when Sencion started toward him, Swagler backed away."I wish I had shot at him when he was going in the IHOP," said Swagler, who owns Locals BBQ & Grill. "But when he came at me, when somebody is pointing an automatic weapon at you — you can't believe the firepower, the kind of rounds coming out of that weapon."Sencion struck each of the Guard members in the restaurant in what witnesses described as a seemingly intentional attack. He then exited the restaurant and fired shots toward the barbecue restaurant, shattering the windows. He also fired toward an H&R Block and a casino across the street.Sencion had shot himself and was lying injured in the parking lot by the time officers arrived. A crowd of reporters and onlookers could see a body on the ground, covered with a white sheet except for the feet, clad in tan boots.Fran Hunter is a frequent IHOP customer who works in a pet supply store next door but made a last second decision Tuesday to eat at the casino coffee shop across the street."It turned out to be a good decision," she told the AP. "If you know the IHOP, they had to be sitting ducks with that long narrow aisle — if they were at those tables with no way to get out."Servicemen flocked to a Reno hospital after the shooting, nervously waiting for word on those killed and hurt."It's hard to believe something like this would happen to really good people," said Spc. Lee Amato, 33, a Nevada Army National Guard member. "It's like a hole, something taken away. It's mind-boggling and hard to comprehend."Sgt. 1st class Cameron Anderson, 31, of Reno, was tasked with driving the Guard's chaplain to the hospital."You go a whole tour in Afghanistan and no one is shot," Anderson said. "And you go to IHOP and several are shot. It's a shock."The names of the victims, including the three Guard members — a woman and two men — who were killed, were not immediately released.Officials were analyzing the assault rifle to determine whether it is automatic or semi-automatic. Sencion left two more guns in the van — another rifle and a pistol, authorities said. Furlong said law enforcement agencies would continue investigating as they conducted searches through the night, although he did not give further detail or say where.The violent outburst rattled Nevada's capital city after the long Labor Day weekend when many officials, including Gov. Brian Sandoval, had left town. Carson City is also a jumping off point 30 miles south of Reno for travelers headed to Lake Tahoe or back to California across the Sierra.Nevada officials initially feared the worst as news of the shooting spread. The state Capitol and Supreme Court buildings were briefly closed and extra security were sent to guard state and military buildings in northern Nevada to prevent further violence. The IHOP is several miles from the Guard's state headquarters complex.Sandoval was in Las Vegas when the shooting occurred. He soon returned to the capital, where he was briefed by police and his security adviser."Everything is being done to ensure the public's safety," Sandoval said in a statement. He ordered flags to half-staff through Friday night in honor of the killed guardsmen.Sencion was born in Mexico and had a valid U.S. passport. He worked at a family business in South Lake Tahoe and had no known affiliations with anyone inside the restaurant, Furlong said. He was not in the military.Sencion filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2009, listing more than $42,000 in outstanding debts for a car, several credit cards and some medical expenses. The case was discharged four months later.A lawyer representing some of Sencion's family members called the shooting "an aberration of his character.""He's a gentle, kind man who was very helpful to friends and family," Joe Laub told The Associated Press. "I couldn't venture to guess what would cause him to do something as horrible as this."___Associated Press writers Michelle Rindels, Oskar Garcia, Ken Ritter and Cristina Silva in Las Vegas and Martin Griffith and Scott Sonner in Carson City contributed to this report.

Can the gun defenders explain to me how guns keep you safe? If that argument is valid, why is it that in Europe, where guns are very strictly controlled, the murder rate is one-tenth that of the US. Logically, if guns keep you safe, the murder rate should be 10 times higher in Europe, not 10 times lower. I am waiting for an (intelligent) explanation for this. Thank you.

Why would Obama be arming the Mexican drug cartels? Why would he join Mexico in a lawsuit against an American state that is trying to enforce immigration laws? Why are 26 states suing him? why has he instructed the Justice Dept not to pursue hate and civil rights crimes when whites are victims? Why are mobs of his supporters attacking whites this summer? Obamas hate retoric,thats why.

What do you expect when those states want to own guns, and even high powered military weapons. 5 people killed in W.Va. 3 in Colorado and on and on. This country is gun crazy, and to pretend these are innocent people in Coorado that did not expect their town to have these types of killings is stupid; no one is safe in this insane country.

Sigh.  The U.S. has to crackdown on automatic weapons, or this ends up being the result.  I don't know how you go about doing that, but it has to happen.  There's zero reason why anyone should be in possession of guns like that except law enforcement and military personnel.

I don't understand why that guy at the barbecue shop didn't open up. Myself a former Marine understand the best chance you have to survive in a fire fight is to put lead down range. The only way to make it stop is to shoot back. Been in a couple fire fights and if you get rounds down toward the target they will at least seek shelter and pause, most often they can't tell what direction the rounds are coming from. Sound bounces around and it is very confusing. Most often they never direct fire directly back at you. I have found you can often move in close to em and put the double tap on the SOB. Been there done that.

I've asked for just one example where a killer's bloody rampage was stopped by a brave citizen and so far all I've gotten is examples of chickens**t burglars (most likely unarmed) being stopped by homeowners and store clerks.

Come on NRA super-fans... there must be some poster child out there who saved the community from that crazy drug-addled Athiest liberal Obama-voting ACORN member who was shootin' up the place.  I'd think you'd want that hero to run for President of the Earth.  So come on... start naming heroes.  Not home invasion defenders.

Armchair commandos - could you provide some examples where crazed gunmen firing into crowds were stopped by fellow brave commandos like yourselves?  Or do you all turn 'BBQ restaurant owner' as he goes strolling by, unloading his high power assault weapon?  I bet most of you would-be heroes would actually be wetting yourselves.

The gunfire prompted Ralph Swagler, the owner of a nearby barbecue restaurant, to grab his weapon. But when Sencion started toward him, Swagler backed away.

Hmmmm, guess that blows away that whole armed public B.S.

Considering he used an AK-47 and had several more guns, he was a Republican..as such he will be enshrined by the rightwing ideologues as a national hero (quietly though as they pretend to not push for violence)..Another fine example of the rightwing terrorism REAL americans have to be afraid of

I pray these people were right with God and were born again. None of us know the day or the hour when our tour of duty will be over. Nothing happens in this world that God doesn't allow and at this moment these familys are in shock and grief. May they find the peace that only our Lord can give. I'm so sorry for your loss.

I carry a gun because a cop is too heavy to carry.
The reason I carry a Colt 45 is because they don’t make a 46.

Obama has dozens of very heavily armed men protecting him and his family.  Who is protecting you?

I like the people who think they still get to bear arms to protect themselves from an overly powerful government.  Would get a kick out of seeing some redneck defending his home with his 30.6, trying to scare off a single Apache Helicopter.

still hoping someone can provide a real-life example where a crazed gunman was stopped short by an ordinary armed citizen.  Lots of incidents where people went postal... so it shouldn't be too tough to find an example where one of the millions of armed civilians out there put a stop to it.

Mentally troubled, and walking around with an AK47.  You know, I'm not troubled at all, and I cannot get an AK47?  How did this mental case get hold of something like that and where can I get one to protect myself against the next crazy person with a grudge against the mean old world that won't kiss his toes the way he wants?

This killer was from Mexico and here visiting on a passport and note he was getting social security also....so they get ss when they are here on a passport?  The witnesses said the attack on our NG members seemed intentional and yet they don't know if he was targetting the NG?  Where is obama and calderon's statement on this?  They are the ones who want these illegals (or ones here on passports, about the same thing when they are also getting ss)  coming to our Country....remember people when you vote, these are the kind of people obama wants to give citizenship to!

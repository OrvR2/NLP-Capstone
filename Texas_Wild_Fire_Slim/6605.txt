A ghoulish good time
Thursday night’s 2008 Goblins and Ghosts Bash had downtown filled with the scariest, freakiest and cutest costumed children Ennis had to offer. The event, hosted by the Ennis Chamber of Commerce and Ennis Historic Downtown Merchants Association, allowed fifth graders and younger to play games and go business-to-business collecting candy. It is always a great [...]

Waxahachie leaves with three-game win over Lady Lions
Ennis’ focus now shifts to playoff contest Tuesday night wasn’t a good one for Lady Lion volleyball, but fortunately Ennis lives to play another day.

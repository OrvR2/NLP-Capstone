R.I.P. Andy Whitfield – Deadline.com






In the arena as Spartacus, he was invincible. But in real life, former Spartacus: blood and sand star Andy Whitfield has lost his battle with lymphoma non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The Welsh actor, beloved by the fans of the Starz Gladiator drama, died today in Sydney, Australia, where he had lived since 1999. In a statement said the woman that the actor died in Whitfield Vashti "a sunny Sydney Morning" in the "arms of his loving wife". He had 37."We are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend and colleague, Andy Whitfield," President and CEO of Chris Albrecht Starz said in a statement. "We were very fortunate to have worked with Andy in Spartacus and discovers that the man who played on the screen a champion was also a champion in his own life." Andy was a source of inspiration for us all if he faced this very personal fight with courage, strength and grace. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this difficult time. "He is living in the hearts of his family, friends and fans."

Whitfield got his big break when he was chosen as the character in the title of Spartacus: blood and sand. But during a routine check in March 2010 just before production was to begin in season 2, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins Lymphoma treatable stage. Production was put on hold while Whitfield underwent treatment. It went into remission and was finally of filming days in season 2 when his cancer returned and had to resume aggressive treatment. However, it is still positive, while the role of Spatracus was eventually recast with Liam McIntyre.

Happy Mooncake Festival 2011 | Hpility Story






You are a Chinese born prior to the 1980s with s, I am convinced that the only parts that play paper lanterns are so easily ignite. Much less those moments when I had fun lighting candles around the House, a walk in the night with a flashlight in hand and hits on friends and it burns ... snails! UNRWA!
Unfortunately I have only now the opportunity to see of a snail; We want a history and paper lanterns, children are spoiled with lanterns, lit when you turn on, not just the lanterns are built on wheels that can now as a remote control car!
Those were the days ... the technology is good, but sometimes just not willing to accept from the old school. Give you a pat on the back if you share my feelings.

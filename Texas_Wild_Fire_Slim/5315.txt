Perry hits back at Paul for negative adBy Chris MoodyPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody | The Ticket – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

Reagan (Larry Stoddard/AP)Texas Gov. Rick Perry's presidential campaign hit back at fellow Texan Rep. Ron Paul, for a campaign ad that touted Paul's early support for former President Ronald Reagan and knocked Perry for his Democratic past. In the counter-attack, Perry's campaign revealed a letter Paul wrote in 1987 that cited Reagan as a reason why he left the Republican Party.
Paul was one of only a handful of elected lawmakers to support Reagan's failed bid for president in 1976, but he became disenchanted after Reagan won the election in 1980. Paul left the party six years later to run for president for the Libertarian Party and published a scathing letter that blasted Republicans and Reagan, blaming them for "skyrocketing deficits" and legitimizing "big government ... in a way that Democrats never could have accomplished."
"I have gradually and steadily grown weary of the Republican Party's efforts to reduce the size of the federal government," Paul wrote in the letter.  "Since then Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party have given us skyrocketing deficits, and astoundingly a doubled national debt.  How is it that the party of balanced budgets, with control of the White House and Senate, accumulated red ink greater than all previous administrations put together?"
"There is no credibility left for the Republican Party as a force to reduce the size of government," he added.  "That is the message of the Reagan years."
You can see Paul's response and the full letter after the jump...
In response, Paul's campaign pointed to Paul's policy proposals during that time and repeated the points in the ad that focused on Perry's past support for Al Gore's 1988 presidential campaign.
"Dr. Paul was going after Perry for being liberal in 1988. What's Rick Perry's attack for, being too conservative?" Paul spokesman Gary Howard told The Ticket. "The contrast here is  plain: Dr. Paul wanted a stronger conservative revolution, Gov. Perry  worked to end it."
The full letter:
As a lifelong Republican, it saddens me to have to write this letter. My parents believed in the Republican Party and its free enterprise philosophy, and that's the way I was brought up.  At age 21, in 1956, I cast my first vote for Ike and the entire Republican slate.
Because of frustration with the direction in which the country was going, I became a political activist and ran for the U.S. Congress in 1974. Even with Watergate, my loyalty, optimism, and hope for the future were tied to the Republican Party and its message of free enterprise, limited government, and balanced budgets.
Eventually I was elected to the U.S. Congress four times as a Republican.  This permitted me a first-hand look at the interworkings of the U.S. Congress, seeing both the benefits and partisan frustrations that guide its shaky proceedings.  I found that although representative government still exists, special interest control of the legislative process clearly presents a danger to our constitutional system of government.
In 1976 I was impressed with Ronald Reagan's program and was one of the four members of Congress who endorsed his candidacy.  In 1980, unlike other Republican office holders in Texas, I again supported our President in his efforts.
Since 1981, however, I have gradually and steadily grown weary of the Republican Party's efforts to reduce the size of the federal government. Since then Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party have given us skyrocketing deficits, and astoundingly a doubled national debt.  How is it that the party of balanced budgets, with control of the White House and Senate, accumulated red ink greater than all previous administrations put together?  Tip O'Neill, although part of the problem, cannot alone be blamed.
Tax revenues are up 59 percent since 1980. Because of our economic growth?  No.  During Carter's four years, we had growth of 37.2 percent; Reagan's five years have given us 30.7 percent.  The new revenues are due to four giant Republican tax increases since 1981.
All Republicans rightly chastised Carter for his $38 billion deficit. But they ignore or even defend deficits of $220 billion, as government spending has grown 10.4 percent per year since Reagan took office, while the federal payroll has zoomed by a quarter of a million bureaucrats.
Despite the Supply-Sider-Keynesian claim that "deficits don't matter," the debt presents a grave threat to our country.  Thanks to the President and Republican Party, we have lost the chance to reduce the deficit and the spending in a non-crisis fashion.  Even worse, big government has been legitimized in a way the Democrats never could have accomplished.  It was tragic to listen to Ronald Reagan on the 1986 campaign trail bragging about his high spending on farm subsidies, welfare, warfare, etc., in his futile effort to hold on to control of the Senate.
Instead of cutting some of the immeasurable waste in the Department of Defense, it has gotten worse, with the inevitable result that we are less secure today.  Reagan's foreign aid expenditures exceed Eisenhower's, Kennedy's, Johnson's, Nixon's, Ford's, and Carter's put together.  Foreign intervention has exploded since 1980.  Only an end to military welfare for foreign governments plus a curtailment of our unconstitutional commitments abroad will enable us really to defend ourselves and solve our financial problems.
Amidst the failure of the Gramm-Rudman gimmick, we hear the President and the Republican Party call for a balanced-budget amendment and a line-item veto.  This is only a smokescreen.  President Reagan, as governor of California, had a line-item veto and virtually never used it.  As President he has failed to exercise his constitutional responsibility to veto spending. Instead, he has encouraged it.
Monetary policy has been disastrous as well.  The five Reagan appointees to the Federal Reserve Board have advocated even faster monetary inflation than Chairman Volcker, and this is the fourth straight year of double-digit increases.  The chickens have yet to come home to roost, but they will, and America will suffer from a Reaganomics that is nothing but warmed-over Keynesianism.
Candidate Reagan in 1980 correctly opposed draft registration.  Yet when he had the chance to abolish it, he reneged, as he did on his pledge to abolish the Departments of Education and Energy, or to work against abortion.
Under the guise of attacking drug use and money laundering, the Republican Administration has systematically attacked personal and financial privacy.  The effect has been to victimize innocent Americans who wish to conduct their private lives without government snooping.  (Should people really be put on a suspected drug dealer list because they transfer $3,000 at one time?)  Reagan's urine testing of Americans without probable cause is a clear violation of our civil liberties, as are his proposals for extensive "lie detector" tests.
Under Reagan, the IRS has grown bigger, richer, more powerful, and more arrogant.  In the words of the founders of our country, our government has "sent hither swarms" of tax gatherers "to harass our people and eat out their substance."  His officers jailed the innocent George Hansen, with the President refusing to pardon a great American whose only crime was to defend the Constitution. Reagan's new tax "reform" gives even more power to the IRS.  Far from making taxes fairer or simpler, it deceitfully raises more revenue for the government to waste.
Knowing this administration's record, I wasn't surprised by its Libyan disinformation campaign, Israeli-Iranian arms-for-hostages swap, or illegal funding of the Contras.  All this has contributed to my disenchantment with the Republican Party, and helped me make up my mind.
I want to totally disassociate myself from the policies that have given us unprecedented deficits, massive monetary inflation, indiscriminate military spending, an irrational and unconstitutional foreign policy, zooming foreign aid, the exaltation of international banking, and the attack on our personal liberties and privacy.
After years of trying to work through the Republican Party both in and out of government, I have reluctantly concluded that my efforts must be carried on outside the Republican Party. Republicans know that the Democratic agenda is dangerous to our political and economic health.  Yet, in the past six years Republicans have expanded its worst aspects and called them our own.  The Republican Party has not reduced the size of government. It has become big government's best friend.
If Ronald Reagan couldn't or wouldn't balance the budget, which Republican leader on the horizon can we possibly expect to do so? There is no credibility left for the Republican Party as a force to reduce the size of government.  That is the message of the Reagan years.
I conclude that one must look to other avenues if a successful effort is ever to be achieved in reversing America's direction.
I therefore resign my membership in the Republican Party and enclose my membership card.

Just one thing as Ron Paul was completely right.  Personly I loved to hear Reagan speak and he was a great actor.   But what he said and what he did were opposites.  You know like he failed to keep his word.

Well I never thought I'd see the day that I would thank Perry but I really do thank him for getting Ron Paul's letter published in full.  Wouldn't it be neat if the nations newspapers would do the same.
Now for lthe slammer;  Perry you and I both know that the insiders have gotten you established in this race to take votes away from Texas Congeressman Ron Paul.  Just as they will insert Palin into the race when Ron Paul makes them nervous enough.
All we need is the people of this great country of ours to realize that Ron Paul can win this race.  All they need to do is get behind him and support him;   Talk and work for him and educate the unknowing nicely.

More Perry propaganda only serves to bolster Paul's credibility. Perry is a globalist, bilderberg, bohemian grove attendee. Paul is not. Nuff said.

Let's see: Mr Perry is a rebanded George Wallace, with a better 'do, basically an evangelical, bigoted huckster.  Dr Perry wants a deconstructed, fragmented US, like we had under the Articles of Confederation, and for which the South fought and lost the Civil War.  Ms Bachmann doesn't demonstrate the most basic understanding of history or economics.  Mr Romney is a political chameleon, with a history of job obliteration as a venture capitalist, and no job creation at all as governor.  The GOP, the party of Abraham Lincoln, Nelson Rockefeller, Birch Bayh and Edward Brooke, has most assuredly fallen on hard times.

Want to scare the heck out of the establishment, then Vote for Ron Paul. He will do his best to end the games. The question then would be, how long does he live.

It is important to note that while Reagan created the LIE of "trickle down" he would be appalled at the right wing attacks on Social Security and of a mind with liberals about the need for AMERICA to have both Social Security AND good schools AND TAXES!

Ron Paul was right to leave the party back in 1980. It was at that time the troubles with the US deficit began. Reagan was maybe a great actor and decisive politician, but he had little sense about economics. The satellite wars were a heavy duty expense, being felt after years.

Wow! these are the people who say they are better than Obama? Are you kidden? Is this the creme of the crops the Republicans have to offer? What a joke! The front runner want to kill social security? The front runner's state rates number one in high school drop outs and he still cut the education budget! Is this what the republicans have to offer. Perry will ruin this country 10 times worst than Bush. America, wake up!!!

Ron Paul is the only candidate to be consistent in his views for the past 30+ years. most candidates can't be consistent for 1 year (Rick Perry is backing off comments he made in his book published last year). Some of his views are too radical for me, but at least he has a plan for change, rather than what I perceive as just campaign promises and platitudes coming from the other candidates. He tells us what we need to hear, the other candidates tell us what they think we want to hear.

Let the mud slinging begin! That so endears me to each and every one of the candidates! Why can't they just campaign without slinging mud at each other with half truths and innuendos? Just tell me how you believe you can run this country and benefit the people of the United States.

Last week, Alton Brown filmed the last-ever episode of successful food show Good Eats after 13 years on the Food Network, NPR reports. Brown announced in May that Good Eats would be ending at the end of the current season. 
Brown has recently been a controversial figure. Many in the food world criticized him for his criticism of the molecular gastronomy movement. This was an especially surprising controversy in light of Brown's general enthusiasm for exactitude in the kitchen; he seemed like someone who would love the intersection of science and cooking.
If you're feeling nostalgic -- or never got a chance to see Good Eats in its prime -- here's a clip of Alton Brown demonstrating his very precise technique for meatloaf.

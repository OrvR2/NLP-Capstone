Photo of the day: Pyrenees camping
by Elizabeth Seward (RSS feed)  on Sep 14th, 2011  at  5:00PM



Camping in the Pyrenees Mountains. Backpacking in the Pyrenees Mountains. This image transports you there. It shows you what it's like to tuck yourself and your tent into a valley and to wake up there in the mist in the morning. It's beautiful.

The Pyrenees Mountain Range is in southwest Europe. The mountains form a natural border between France and Spain. The small country of Andorra is also witness to these beautiful mountains. The Pyrenees are popular for winter sports, but plenty of people flock to them during warmer months, as well. Photographer Christoph Sahle spent part of his summer a couple of years ago exploring the mountain range on foot, with his tent and camera in tow. His photos from this trip can be found on his Flickr and they're breathtaking. I'd love to visit these mountains.

Have you visited the Pyrenees? What was your experience like?

And, as always, if you'd like to submit a photo to us for our Photo of The Day, just upload it to the Gadling Flickr Pool.

Madrid day trip: a classic Spanish castle at Manzanares el Real
by Sean McLachlan (RSS feed)  on Sep 14th, 2011  at  3:30PM


If you like a good castle, Spain is one of the best countries in the world to visit. One of Spain's finest castles is at the town of Manzanares el Real and makes a good day trip from Madrid.

El Castillo de los Mendoza was built in 1475 for Don Pedro González de Mendoza as both a palace and fortress, although he never actually lived here. It shows an Islamic flair, as you can see from the pictures. Many Spanish buildings from this period do. Despite all the bloody battles of the Reconquista, the Christians, Jews, and Arabs spent as much time trading ideas as fighting.

The castle dates from near the end of the great castle-building age. Artillery was already becoming common in most armies and castles like this couldn't stand a long bombardment. Luckily it never had to and it's one of the best-preserved castles in Spain. One hint that it was at the cusp of the modern era are the arrow slits in the outer wall. They all have loopholes at the bottom to fire guns or small cannons out of. While the guns of the 15th century were less accurate and much slower than bows, they could punch through armor much more effectively.

You'd certainly want some artillery to blow a hole in one of the walls, because going in through the gate would be a very bad idea. The defenders could shoot at you from three sides and drop things from above through those charming favorites of castle architecture--the murder holes. While it's commonly believed that boiling oil was poured through these, one medievalist and author I know says the story of using boiling oil in sieges is a myth. Apparently boiling water was just as good and much cheaper.

Virgin America improves inflight entertainment system
by Grant Martin (RSS feed)  on Sep 14th, 2011  at  1:00PM


Part of the reason that Virgin America keeps getting voted the best domestic carrier is because of their Inflight Entertainment (IFE). Called RED, the seatback system lets passengers browse live television, catch up pre-recorded shows, watch movies and participate in a whole host of other fancy activities from ordering food to browsing around a real-time Google map.


	To stay on top of the industry though, the airline needs to keep adapting their system, and they're starting the process this week with the announcement of the integration of the Lufthansa Systems' BoardConnect platform into their fleet.
 .
	Basically, the BoardConnect platform is a completely new engine on top of which the RED system is going to live, meaning that the IFE will look similar moving forward but will be completely overhauled under the hood. The technology leverages a wireless internet network to maintain and update its data, which means that content will now be updated faster and at lower cost. In turn, this translates to a better experience for the passengers on board, which is always great to hear about.

	Hopefully it also means that we can get our boys from Travel Talk churning within the RED channels once more.

	BoardConnect technology has already been unrolled on the airplane #nerdbird. More updates are expected on later aircraft.

Great destinations for fall foliage viewing outside of New England
by McLean Robbins (RSS feed)  on Sep 14th, 2011  at  11:00AM


One of our favorite fall trips is a long drive into the country to view the changing leaves. Last year was considered one of the best on record, and we're hoping this year will be no exception. Break from the expected and enjoy these five off-the-beaten-path destinations for fall foliage viewing:

Moonlight Basin, Montana
	Montana seems to constantly get overlooked by more publicized destinations like Colorado and Wyoming, but come autumn, take advantage of this fact and skip the crowds. Rent a rustic, but very luxurious Cowboy Cabin at Moonlight Basin, complete with front porch hot tub and views as far as the eye can see. 

Asheville, North Carolina
	Take a scenic drive through the North Carolina mountains before stopping to enjoy some of the East Coast's best breweries and chic indie art galleries. We'd bunk at the luxe Grove Park Inn, where the President stayed on his last visit, or perhaps continue the drive into the mountains and rent a cabin at Fontana Dam.

Jackson Hole, Wyoming
	Leaf peeping in the rugged Teton National Park is tough to beat, and the prime spot to stay during the autumn season is at the luxe Four Seasons Resort Jackson Hole, where you can enjoy amenities including nightly s'mores. As an added bonus, the hotel also offers Wildlife Safari Tours, hosted by its own in-house Wildlife Biologist, Tenley Thompson.

Whistler, British Columbia 
	Enjoy some of Canada's most scenic glaciated peaks and  roaring rivers. Arrive early enough and you'll also catch quite the leaf show. We'd opt to stay at the Fairmont Chateau Whistler or the Four Seasons Resort Whistler.

Colorado Springs, Colorado
	Colorado Springs is dwarfed by the surrounding Pikes Peak National Forest, and the towering 14,000-foot Pikes Peak. The number of easily accessed areas for leaf peeping the city is astounding. Cheyenne Mountain Resort is the perfect base camp for a trip to Colorado Springs. The resort boasts its own golf resort, on-site herb garden and ease of access to Garden of the Gods and the Pikes Peak National Forest – including the Pikes Peak Cog Railway.

A Grand Tour of the American West
by Paul Brady (RSS feed)  on Sep 14th, 2011  at  10:00AM





	I could see the end of my road trip, on the other side of the deserts of the American Southwest, the sun-parched stretch of near nothingness that conceals some of the country's greatest natural wonders. So after leaving Spaceport America in New Mexico, I prepared for a ironman push to the West Coast, my ultimate destination Los Angeles. Along the way, I'd stop at the Four Corners and the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas and probably some dusty, God-forsaken gas station in the middle of a field of rock and scrub and little else. It was going to be a long drive but, weirdly, I was excited.

Largest dam removal in U.S. history begins at Olympic National Park
by Kraig Becker (RSS feed)  on Sep 14th, 2011  at  9:00AM

This weekend the largest dam removal project in U.S. history will begin on the Elwha River in Olympic National Park, located in the state of Washington. The three-year process to dismantle both the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams will free the river for the first time in nearly a century and is expected to have a restorative effect on the park's ecosystem, as well as an economic impact on the surrounding communities.

According to the National Parks Conservation Association, the removal of the two dams is expected to boost the salmon population in the river from an estimated 3000 now to nearly 400,000 once the project is complete. Researchers believe that they'll see the return of all five species of Pacific salmon to the river, as native species return to their previous habitats. Those fish provide important nutrients and resources for more than 130 species of both aquatic and terrestrial wildlife in the region, including other fish, bears, and eagles. Those populations are expected to thrive as well, once the salmon numbers increase to their natural levels.

The benefits to the region don't end there however, as the removal of the dams is also expected to bring new economic opportunities as well. The dramatic increase in fish populations should lure in both sport and commercial fishermen, and the newly opened 70-mile river corridor will offer fantastic paddling too. The NPCA estimates that the Elwha River restoration project could bring as many as 500,000 new visitors to the area on an annual basis, translating into an additional $57 million per year in the local economy.

As the dam removal process gets underway, conservationists and fans of the national parks have kicked off an official dam-breaking festival known as Celebrate Elwha. Over the next few days, the festival will host a number of music and art events, as well as several guest speakers, as the Park Service, the NPCA, and the community celebrate this important step towards restoring the natural environment at Olympic.

This is such an important move in creating a healthier environment in the park and the wilderness around it. I applaud everyone involved in getting these dams removed and opening up the river once again. If you've ever visited the Elwha River valley in the past, you will definitely want to schedule a return trip in a few years time, as it is likely to be a very different place in the years ahead.

Hang glider vomits repeatedly from 2,000 feet
by Mike Barish (RSS feed)  on Sep 13th, 2011  at  6:30PM



Motion sickness sucks. Whether you're on a plane, in a car or on a boat, that type of nausea is just crippling. On top of that, it's really embarrassing to throw up in public. It grosses people out and makes everyone, including you, uncomfortable. Imagine, then, what it must feel like to throw up while laying on top of someone...in a hang glider...2,000 feet above ground. Apparently, however, that type of airsickness is not the least bit awkward. In fact, the hang glider in this video seems to possess the magical ability to make such aerial regurgitation downright amusing (at least to the pilot, who seems positively tickled by his passenger's condition).

We're really left with only two questions: What did that guy have for breakfast and were the people below wearing ponchos?

Video of the Day - Through the Alps
by Stephen Greenwood (RSS feed)  on Sep 13th, 2011  at  5:00PM




The Alps. Stretching from Austria and Slovenia in the east through Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany and France in the west, it is one of the greatest mountain ranges in Europe and arguably the greatest range to navigate by car (or motorcycle) in the world.

Today's Video of the Day captures one man's motorcycle trip through Austria, Italy, Switzerland, & France along routes such as the Stelvio, the Silvretta, and the Grossglockner; all of which are extremely impressive feats of construction & maintenance. While there isn't any description or storytelling, it's a great way to experience the sights and sounds of the Alps.

Have you captured an amazing road adventure? We want to see it too! Share your videos with us in the comments below, or upload photos to our Flickr pool and it could be the next Photo/Video of the Day.

Emirates, Virgin America win Passenger Choice Awards
by Melanie Renzulli (RSS feed)  on Sep 13th, 2011  at  4:00PM

 Window or aisle? Coffee or Coke? Choices for airline passengers are shrinking faster than the on-board snack. But there are some airlines that are still mindful of the passenger experience and they were announced last night at the 2011 Passenger Choice Awards.

Winning the top awards for Best Overall Passenger Experience were Emirates and Virgin America. The top awards were split between larger airlines, with over 50 IFE-equipped (In Flight Entertainment-Equipped) planes in fleet (Emirates), and smaller airlines, with under 50 IFE-quipped planes in fleet (Virgin America). Not surprisingly, Emirates and Virgin America each won for their respective regions, Middle East and Americas, and Virgin America also pulled in awards for Best Inflight Video and Best Ground Experience. Another Virgin brand, V Australia - the international airline of Virgin Australia - won Passenger Choice awards for Best in Region: Asia and Australasia, Best IFE User Interface, and Best Food and Beverage. The only U.S.-based airline to win a Passenger Choice award was JetBlue, which won for Best Cabin Ambiance.

Here are all of the winners:


		Best Overall Passenger Experience (Over 50 IFE EQUIPPED IN FLEET) – Emirates

		Best Overall Passenger Experience (Up to 50 IFE EQUIPPED IN FLEET) – Virgin America

		Best in Region: Africa – South African Airways

		Best in Region: Americas – Virgin America

		Best in Region: Asia and Australasia – V Australia

		Best in Region: Europe – Virgin Atlantic

		Best in Region: Middle East – Emirates

		Best Inflight Publication – Avianca

		Best IFE User Interface – V Australia

		Best Inflight Connectivity & Communications – Oman Air

		Best Inflight Video – Virgin America

		Best Cabin Ambiance – JetBlue

		Best Food & Beverage in conjunction with IFSA – V Australia

		Best Ground Experience – Virgin America


Another winner at the Passenger Choice Awards was Air New Zealand, which won the Avion Award for Best Single Achievement in Passenger Experience for the Skycouch Family Experience (pictured above and in this gallery), which is about as comfortable as you can expect to get in economy class on a commercial flight in the foreseeable future.

Video: Burning Man 2011
by Elizabeth Seward (RSS feed)  on Sep 13th, 2011  at  2:00PM

Burning Man 2011 has come to an end. Friends of mine who attend every (single) year are home from the journey, spiritually awakened, refreshed, and tan. That seems to be how most Burning Man folk return back to their respective homes once the festivities are over with. Burning Man is a week-long event held every year in Black Rock Desert, Nevada. It's called 'Burning Man' because a giant effigy built from wood is burned at the festival. 50,000 people traveled to Burning Man this year from near and far. In fact, for the first time in the history of Burning Man, the 2011 festival sold out. All in all, it's a pretty big deal. All not-so-nice stereotypes aside, I honestly would like to experience the event myself. Maybe next year.

In the meantime, check out this video. Fixed around the (what makes it so catchy?) song "Home" by Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeroes, this video gives you a little bit of insight to Burning Man 2011.

WARNING: While nobody is completely naked in this video, there is plenty of skin to be seen. Use your own discretion before playing this video in the office, in front of your small children, your green-with-envy girlfriend, and, of course, your grandmother.

Woman from iconic 9/11 photo overcomes decade of hardshipBy Mike KrumboltzMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz | The Upshot – Tue, 6 Sep, 2011

(Photo: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images)The attacks on 9/11 changed the lives of billions -- and few more so 
 than Marcy Borders. Soon after the World Trade Center attacks, Borders 
 was photographed covered in dust and ash from the fallout. The photo, 
taken by Stan Honda of AFP, was one of the iconic images from that 
terrible day.
Borders has been through a lot in the 10 years since. There have been
 problems with depression and substance abuse, as well as lingering 
nightmares about Sept. 11. She recently spoke with the New York Post about her life's ups and downs over the past decade.
On Sept. 11, 2001, Borders had been working at her new bank job for 
just a month. The planes hit the World Trade Center, and a panicked 
Borders left her desk on the 81st floor of the north tower to go out 
into the street to see what was happening.
Just as she got to the street, the south tower fell, and Borders 
couldn't see much of anything. "I couldn't see my hand in front of my 
face. The world went silent," she remarked. Eventually, someone pulled 
her into a building's lobby, where a photographer captured the haunting 
 photo of her surrounded by harsh yellowish dust. According to the U.K.'s Telegraph, Borders still has the clothes she wore that day, "still unwashed and coated in the dust of the twin towers."[ Related: Veteran photographer recalls famous "Falling Man" image ]
Marcy Borders with son Zay-den (Photo: Coleman-Rayner)In her talk with the Post, Borders details some of the difficulties 
she's faced since then: "My life spiraled out of control. I didn't do a 
 day's work in nearly 10 years, and by 2011 I was a complete mess. Every
 time I saw an aircraft, I panicked. If I saw a man on a building, I 
was convinced he was going to shoot me."
This past April, she checked herself into rehab, after realizing that
 she would die if she stayed on her current path. A little more than a 
 week later, she got the news that Osama bin Laden had been killed by 
American forces. The news, along with her new clean and sober lifestyle,
 did a lot to help silence her inner demons. "I used to lose sleep over
 him, have bad dreams about bin Laden bombing my house, but now I have 
 peace of mind."Top photo courtesy of LIFE.com. View their full collection of photos. Share your 9/11 memories with us on Twitter - #911remembered

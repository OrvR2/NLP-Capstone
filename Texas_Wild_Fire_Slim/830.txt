Notes:
				Appearance Package, Mercedes-Benz Certified, Ash Leather, DVD Navigation, Hands-Free Communication System, Heated Front Seats, Power Liftgate, Premium I, Rain Sensor Wipers, Rear Audio Controls, and SIRIUS Satellite Radio. If you demand the best things in life, this superb 2008 Mercedes-Benz M-Class is the one-owner SUV for you. Buying an used car can be a risky proposition, but with the protection of pre-owned certification, you won't be left out in the cold as soon as you drive off the lot. Mercedes-Benz Certified Pre-Owned means you get an additional 12 months Limited Warranty on top of the existing factory warranty, or up to 100,000 miles of coverage. We also do up to a 162-point rigorous inspection/reconditioning, 24/7 roadside assistance, trip-interruption services, and a complete CARFAX vehicle history report. J.D. Power named the 2008 M-Class as the highest ranked in Overall Initial Quality Mechanical in its class.

To best avoid scams and fraud, deal locally. Deals that involve wire transfers or cashier's checks can be fraudulent, as can sellers who refuse to meet in person. Do a thorough inspection of any item before purchase.

The price shown does not include sales tax, any vehicle registration fees, finance charges, dealer preparation charges or any fees charged by the state of issuance in compliance or noncompliance pursuant to any statute. All vehicles are subject to prior sale. We reserve the right to make changes without notice, and are not responsible for errors.

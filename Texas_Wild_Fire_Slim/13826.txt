Progress and frustrations in historic Texas wildfireBy Karen Brooks | Reuters – Fri, Sep 9, 2011

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A deadly and enormously destructive wildfire was still burning on Friday southeast of Austin, but county officials said the nearly 850 firefighters battling the blaze continue to make progress in containing the historic fire.
"Things are looking pretty good out there," said Bastrop County Emergency Coordinator Mike Fisher.
Some 1,386 homes have been destroyed over 34,038 acres in the Bastrop County Complex fire, more homes than any other single blaze in Texas history.
As of Thursday, the fire was 30 percent contained, and officials said that number is likely much higher, but they didn't have a figure to report Friday morning.
Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst sent a request to the White House to declare the entire state of Texas "a major disaster area" earlier in the week and, having not heard back, said he would send another one Friday.
The region in the Bastrop area has been declared a federal disaster area, and officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency have been on the ground since Tuesday doing damage assessments.
Attention on Friday was on staving off the frustrations of thousands of residents clamoring to get back home.
"We will get out of this," said Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald, adding that safety is the reason many have not been able to go back into their burned neighborhoods yet.
"We're going to get back in, we're going to move forward, it's going to be a better time. We're going to get through this."
The blaze has killed two people and forced the evacuation of 5,000. Some 844 personnel are fighting the fire, McDonald said -- in both a ground battle that includes 44 bulldozers and an air assault with Chinook helicopters.
A DC-10 tanker stood ready to help in Bastrop, but because of the progress being made on the ground, it will likely be diverted to one of the other major blazes burning in Texas.
Some residents have been let into their neighborhoods to view the damage or move back into untouched houses.
FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY
Others, frustrated they've gone nearly a week without seeing their homes, shouted angrily at Dewhurst and county officials during a news conference in Bastrop on Friday morning, demanding to know when they can get back in.
"Let me put it like this," McDonald said. "We will not let anyone back in an area until it is safe."
In a sign of hope and recovery even as the fire continues to burn, school officials announced that they would be reopening schools for 9,000 students across the area on Monday. District officials said hundreds of those students are considered homeless due to the fires, but don't have an official count yet.
Counselors will be on hand to help students and parents as they try to return to "a sense of normalcy," said Steve Murray, the Bastrop schools superintendent.
"We understand that there are issues to deal with far beyond anyone in this district or county has had to deal with before," Murray said.
More than 3.6 million acres in Texas have been scorched by wildfires since November, fed by a continuing drought that has caused more than $5 billion in damage to the state's agricultural industry and that shows no sign of easing.
In the past seven days the Texas Forest Service has responded to 186 fires burning some 156,517 acres across the state.
Firefighters are battling massive blazes in Montgomery County, north of Houston, and Cass County, northeast of Dallas near Texarkana.
The Houston-area blaze has scorched more than 15,000 acres and destroyed 75 homes. It is about 60 percent contained, according to the Texas Forest Service.
The Bear Creek fire in northeast Texas has burned anywhere from 25,000 to 40,000 acres, and state forest officials did not have a containment figure on Friday morning.
Bastrop County, with a population around 75,000 and an average income of $27,499 a year per resident, has been particularly hard hit.
The last several weeks have been extremely destructive for fires, which have burned or threatened nearly every county in Texas, state officials said. Drought, low humidity, high winds and no rain have created tinderbox conditions.
So far, four people have died in fires the broke out across the state over the Labor Day weekend, including a mother and infant daughter who died in northeast Texas on Sunday.

Let's see this would be the same Texas where Governor Goodhair refused $875 million in federal aide, raided the education fund to balance the budget and cut funding to the Texas forest Service to save money??  Guess we can't have our cake and eat it to!!!

1400 Homes and 4.5 million acres (That’s an area the size of Connecticut) have gone up in flames this year in Texas. All you Sick Liberals making comments about Rick Perry and how Texas deserves this are showing the liberal true colors, your all about compassion and helping others, and helping your fellow man, but only as long as they agree with you. I hope when tragedy strikes you, or your family people show more kindness to you.

I have compassion for the people of texas, even if they did ask for trouble by electing their current governor. He cut the budgets to the bone, including the monies needed for fire fighting protection personnel and equipment. texas supported that, and kept him. Several states have had to get passed the foolishness of their governors, and the costs to the states. Texas will do it!

Im just heart sick for Texas. I have heard the aluminum in the chemtrails settleing down on trees, make the wild fires much more flamable.

Let them go. You want to go to a dangerous area? Be my guess. If you get into trouble, have the dignity of not disturbing anyone for help.

As we all know, God is a jealous god. Perhaps throwing Rick Perry into the fire will satisfy God's vengeance?

This fire was set by people from the Kremlin because Texas is their major enema.

Wild fires occur naturally, just like global climate change.

Even more sad is how people will comment about this catastrophe (loss of life, untold destruction, people left homeless)  is the direct result having something to do with their political, or religious convictions (God caused this or not believing in God caused it). Arrogance, ignorance, lack of compassion, and stupidity knows no bounds.

Wildfire destroys nearly 500 homes in TexasBy MICHAEL GRACZYK - Associated Press,WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press | AP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

BASTROP, Texas (AP) — Calmer winds Tuesday should help firefighters battling a wildfire that has destroyed nearly 500 homes in Central Texas and forced thousands of residents to evacuate to shelters to avoid the blaze, officials said.Texas Forest Service spokeswoman Victoria Koenig said it is too early to say how much progress was made fighting the wildfire in Bastrop County overnight, but that there were no winds early Tuesday. The fire enveloped at least 25,000 acres Monday."It's encouraging we don't have winds right now, not like yesterday," Koenig said early Tuesday morning.Even with the encouraging conditions, Koenig said it was a "tough, tough fire" that was raging through rugged terrain, including a ridge of hills."You can still see the hills glowing quite a bit," she said.At least 5,000 people were forced from their homes in Bastrop County about 25 miles east of Austin, and about 400 were in emergency shelters, officials said Monday. School and school-related activities were canceled Tuesday.Gov. Rick Perry told NBC's "Today" show that more than 50 fires were burning across the state."We're a long way from having these under control," Perry said.Perry urged residents to follow evacuation orders and not put their lives in danger for the sake of their possessions. He returned to Texas, cutting short a visit to South Carolina where he was campaigning for the Republican nomination for president.Fanned in part by howling winds from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee, the blaze rapidly grew Monday, racing through rain-starved farm and ranchland.Winds in the area gusted up to 30 mph on Monday, but dropped overnight to around 5 mph and were only expected to get up to 10 mph by afternoon, said National Weather Service forecaster Orlando Bermudez.In Bastrop, a town of about 6,000 people along the Colorado River, huge clouds of smoke soared into the sky and hung over downtown Monday. When winds picked up, flames flared over the tops of trees. Helicopters and planes loaded with water flew overhead, and firefighters along a state highway outside the city converged around homes catching fire."Waiting is the most frustrating thing," said Gina Thurman, 47, choking back tears as she sat by herself in the shade on a curb outside Ascension Catholic Church, one of several shelters in the area. "You're sitting there and you don't know anything but your house is probably burning."Rick Blakely was among about 30 people sleeping on cots at the church. The 54-year-old said he was in a state of shock and "not expecting anything to be standing" when he returned to his home."I just don't know what I'm going to do," he said.Strong winds coupled with drought conditions allowed the fire to travel quickly over somewhat hilly terrain, burning through pine and cedar trees and wiping out subdivisions as well as ranchland. Dry conditions were expected to persist at least through the week, according to the National Weather Service.The fire was far enough away from Austin that the city was not threatened, but it consumed land along a line that stretched for about 16 miles, Texas Forest Service officials said.The wildfire destroyed at least 476 homes, and about 250 firefighters were working around the clock using bulldozers and water trucks against the fire, Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald said.There were no immediate reports of injuries, and officials said they knew of no residents trapped in their homes.But the blaze was "nowhere near controlled" on Monday and a separate, smaller blaze south of the city was growing larger, said Mike Fischer, the county's emergency management director. It's unclear how the fire began.Crews have responded to nearly 21,000 wildfires in Texas since the traditional fire season began early in the year. Outdoor burning, including campfires, is prohibited in all but three of the state's 254 counties.The governor's office said at least 40 Texas Forest Service aircraft were involved in the firefighting Monday along with a half-dozen Texas military aircraft.Since December, wildfires in Texas have claimed 3.5 million acres — an area the size of Connecticut — and destroyed more than 1,000 homes, Perry said. The governor said it was too early to say whether he would attend Wednesday's GOP debate in California."I'm not paying attention to politics right now," he said. "There will be plenty of time for that. People's lives and their possessions are at stake, and that's substantially more important."Authorities mobilized ground and air forces to fight the largest of at least 63 fires that broke out in Texas since Sunday as strong winds from what was then Tropical Storm Lee swept into Texas, which has endured its worst drought since the 1950s.On Sunday, about 200 miles to the northeast in Gladewater, a 20-year-old woman and her 18-month-old daughter died when a fast-moving wildfire gutted their mobile home. That fire was out Monday, although several other major blazes continued to burn in at least four other counties in central and northern Texas.To the west of Austin in Travis County, at least 20 homes were lost and 30 others were damaged in another fire. More than 1,000 homes were under mandatory evacuation and 25 lost in a third fire also in the Austin area.Firefighters were also battling wildfires across parched California, including a brush fire sparked by a small plane crash south of Bakersfield. Wildfires have burned at least 500 acres and three homes in northwestern Louisiana.In Texas, at least two-thirds of the 6,000-acre Bastrop State Park have burned. The park is home to endangered Houston toads and several historic rock and stone buildings built in the 1930s and 1940s that officials are trying to protect, said Mike Cox of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.From the park's front gate, Cox said: "All I see is a wall of smoke."___Graczyk reported from Houston. Associated Press writer Danny Robbins and Jamie Stengle in Dallas, and freelance photographer Erich Chlegel contributed to this report.

Politics aside, please keep the "regular" people of Central Texas in your thoughts.  The area in Bastrop County where around 400 homes were destroyed is mostly working class people who have been having a tough enough time in this economy without loosing everything in a fire.

And yet Obama continues to ignore us. No federal aid at all.  Good luck with re-election dirt bag.

Perry came back to Texas to "help" - check out his speech - Google Austin, TX TV Stations.  I think his "handlers" have him so scared to make a mistake that he couldn't even talk on his home turf.

God is punishing Texas.  When will the Anti-Washington Governor, Rick Perry, ask President Obama for some of them federal dollars?  Pretty darn soon I think.  Texas is broke because Perry didn't have enought back bone to do what was best for the people of Texas.  Most of these small towns have little to no water and all volunteer fire departments.  Perry is a terrible governor and a terrible leader.  I hope this scumbag don't get elected President.

All you right wing Conservative Republicans get in line for a federal handout.  You don't like paying taxes but you sure love the federal handouts.  There is an alternative to federal dollars:  Texas has more churches than it has gas stations including mega churches.  Now these churches have a chance to do God's work and come to the aid of their state and their people.  Let us watch and see how Rick the Prick leads without begging Washington for help.  Should be a very good show to watch.  Stayed tuned for the rest of the story.

Leave the garbage out of this just for once. People just like you and me are losing everything, including their family and friends and neighbors. Save the politics and the bigotry 
for some other time. You have lots of opportunity to spew your hate- this should not be one of them. You just might be in similar situation soon. At least act like you have some decency. Or just shut up.

Where are the promises from Obama to send aid to Texas? I guess he is so used to producing hot air that he doesn't deem it worth notice.

I sure hope Gov. Perry, he of little to no government, pulls those UNION firefighters off the line, refuses any help from the Natl. Guard and turns his back on FEMA and any disaster money coming from the government. Even though his track record is to stick his hand out and as for as much government money as possible THIS time he better walk the walk. 

Sorry to hear what's going down right now Texas. And all the personal tragedies aside, which are horrific to watch, I hope you understand that there are some who feel this is ironic justice. Considering your State's commitment to the oil industry and contribution to creating the weather conditions that have made this fire, and all the other natural disasters over the past few years, a reality, I guess that line about 'reaping what you sow' actually makes some sense.

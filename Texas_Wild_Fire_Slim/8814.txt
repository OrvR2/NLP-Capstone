This Is A Relief Rally- Not A Bull MarketBy Robert Lenzner | Forbes – Mon, Aug 1, 2011





Stock markets rallied as a form of relief from possible Armageddon. There will be no default and  at worst a rating reduction to the quite satisfactory AA+. Note that the preachers of doom in the form of interest rate spikes were wrong, dead wrong; The 10 year Treasury yield-- the most sensitive measure of the cost of borrowing money remains mired at 2.84%. Mired that is in cheapness. Mortgage rates will adjust reasonably. Banks will continue to coin profits from the steep yield curve.
We have officially entered the Age of Austerity. Less government spending. Cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, a means test for Social Security. But, we were dragged screaming and shouting there by this dreaded Tea Party movement that thinks its perfectly just NOT to tax rich people to pay for the deficit.
As for myself I guess when you look at the numbers- $2.5 trillion cut over 10 years--or $250 billion a year-- that's small potatoes-- less than 2% of GDP.  Not desperately unimaginably tough to handle.
Still, we have stained ourselves, again after the 2008 debacle when our excesses in the financial system almost did the world in. Now, we are still facing recuperation, meaning that everyone has to pay a bill for  an extended time-- maybe forever. Ain't no bull market to come of that.

Regulate Oil and other Commodities! Stop Wall Street from manipulating these sectors! Keep them on the Financials and Business Sectors where they should be! We are going to lose 700 billion in our economy because of these profits that goes to the oil companies this year. That’s what stops consumer spending. That’s what stops companies from hiring. 
  And handle the Debt! We are spending 700 billion a year on Military while we have 1.5 Trillion in deficits every year! How are we going to get a surplus?! The whole worlds military doesn't even spend that much. China only spends 100 billion per year! And we can kick their butt 200 times! 
  Stop China from manipulating the remnibi! If you have to put a tariff on them do it! We lost 30 trillion since the 80’s because of this trade deficit and we export 2% of our GDP to China every year because of this trade surplus. We lost an estimated 1.5 million jobs to Mexico! I can go on and on! NAFTA is a joke! 
  And tax the US Corporations that are profiting from oversees workers! For every lost manufacturing job 10 jobs from parts, supplier, and restaurants etc. are lost also! And give them subsidies and tax write-off to open up businesses here! Eliminate regulations that cost us jobs and strengthen those that create jobs, and put higher penalty for those that break and take advantage of environmental laws. The 25 billion spending worked well in the green job sector. Now let’s get the oil and energy companies spend and farm that sector through strong laws and bills! We told them to use 10% solar by 2010. We need to tell them 30% by 2012! That would bring in new jobs!
  Put tariffs on countries under cutting prices by keeping their labor forces in poverty. We want to open to the world! We want free markets! But we want it to benefit everyone! We have 15 trillion GDP! We are the Market! We have been negotiating with these countries on the side of weakness instead of the side of strength. We kowtow to their business practices and ship our manufacturing jobs overseas and help them exploit their people thus creating a vacuum of lost. We can’t buy their products because we have no jobs we exported it! They can’t sell to us because we have no more money! We can’t sell to them because they don’t have wages! It’s a lose/lose situation. Our Corporations created this disconnect chasing profits!
  These countries want and need access to our market! Why do we let them move us! They should follow us! Not us following they’re strategy! We don’t need to help them exploit their people! We need to help then get out of bondage. Not contribute to their indigenous servitude. We need to change this Corporations fallacy of cost cutting! It’s not working! It never did! The Recession just made it easy to see! And watch as the whole world’s standard of living grow with us as they pay higher wages to their workers, then we can service them too because they can afford it. That’s a win/win situation. This is free enterprise! That is the free world! Why are we going backwards?

Weather Warnings & Public Alerts











Thousands have been displaced from their homes 
Tropical Storm Lee made landfall in Louisiana Sunday morning, bringing flooding rains to several Gulf states.While Texas managed to avoid a drenching, strong winds associated with Lee helped to fuel wildfires in the moisture-starved region. Winds have since eased, but officials say more than 40,000 hectares of land have been charred in the last week or so.The two deaths occurred in Bastrop County, near Austin, where the biggest fire continues to burn. Officials have not released any more information about the victims.At least 5,000 people have been forced from their homes in Bastrop County alone. Statewide, some 1,000 structures have been destroyed.The Bastrop County fire devastated a historic state park, consuming several irreplaceable heritage structures. The park was also a last stronghold for the Houston Toad, an endangered species and the first amphibian to be granted protection under the 1973 Endangered Species Act.


Fire in  Bastrop the most catastrophic of more than 170 blazes in Texas 
The good news is, lighter winds and higher humidity is allowing firefighters to make some progress.After burning uncontrolled for several days, crews report that the flames are at least 30 percent contained.The Texas Forest Service has declared this to be the worst fire season in history. Governor Rick Perry said that since December, over one million hectares of land have been claimed by wildfires.Fire season is still underway in Canada as well. On Monday, more than 500 people were forced to flee their homes and campsites in the Kelowna, British Columbia area after a forest fire sparked nearby.Stay updated on the current fire situation in Canada by heading to the Forest Fire Watch.With files from Reuters and the Associated Press

9/11 Remembered
9/11: The 25 Most Powerful PhotosOne decade after 9/11, an unsettling number of images from Ground Zero and its environs remain seared in our collective memory -- unsurprising, perhaps, given the scope and scale of the destruction. But the fact that the deadliest, most visually arresting attacks occurred in New York City also meant that many of the world's best photographers were, in effect, already on the scene when the terrorists struck. Here, to mark the tenth anniversary of 9/11, and in hopes of lending coherence to our shared, turbulent recollections, LIFE.com presents the 25 most stirring, visceral photographs from that day, featuring pictures from the likes of James Nachtwey, Joe Raedle, Spencer Platt, Mario Tama, and other celebrated photojournalists (and one intrepid amateur). These are the pictures we remember: wrenching, indelible photographs that tell the tale of a still-resonant late summer day that changed everything.

Oh, nobody can make comment on "Clinton's surprise 9/11 memorial"?  Too many people starting to realize 9/11 was an inside job as BUSH was to announce NESARA giving financial freedom to EVERY person that day of 9/11. Wake up people!  Look up the DOKELL family, or specifically RON DOKELL. Look how a building is safely demolitioned and how the steel columns are cut on a 45 degree and how the building perfectly collapses. Just as they found on both twin towers.  Just ONE example of PROOF.  Keep spending millions though to go more in deficit costing tax payers MORE.  GOVERNMENT LIES!

Please note the error day and date of most photos...
"Fri, Sep 9, 2011"
It was Tuesday, September 11, 2001.
And don't even tell me they were dated for the day they were posted this year.

Let us be good to others not only to ourselves. Pray for us that we can feel charity towards all. Let us not hurt each other. The world is getting smaller and smaller, we cannot avoid our fellow humans anymore.

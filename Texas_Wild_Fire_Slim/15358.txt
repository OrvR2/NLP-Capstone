Beware of Flying Pumpkins! Punkin Chunkin Coming!
1:29 PM, Sep 14, 2011
Aurora - Fall means turning leaves, cool weather and PUMPKIN PIE...pie in the sky that is. It's time for Punkin Chunkin Colorado on October 8 at the Arapahoe County Fairgrounds. 

Each year, dozens of teams descend upon Aurora with giant trebuchets, catapults and air cannons in tow, ready to see who can dress the craziest, behave the oddest and chuck a pumpkin the farthest. There's music and games and big, big crowds. And if you've never had the pleasure of seeing a pumpkin soar and explode into pumpkin pie in the sky, it's an event you don't want to miss.

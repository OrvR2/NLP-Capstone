Daily Horoscope for September 14

 Scorpio
Spending time improving your health is a good investment today; be sure to eat right and get plenty of sleep while the Moon is passing through your sixth house of health and service. Taking an aggressive stance in your personal health care is better than leaving your well-being in the hands of disinterested professionals. The more you learn about preventing illness and maintaining good health, the better able you will be to heal thyself.

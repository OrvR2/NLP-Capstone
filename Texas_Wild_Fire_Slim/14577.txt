How To Go To Heaven: www.jesus-is-savior.com www.msnbc.msn.com Behind the American 'Kill Team' in Afghanistan How soldiers murdered civilians -- and how officers failed to stop them By Mark Boal Rolling Stone updated 3/28/2011 10:52:03 AM ET Early last year, after six hard months soldiering in Afghanistan, a group of American infantrymen reached a momentous decision: It was finally time to kill a haji. Among the men of Bravo Company, the notion of killing an Afghan civilian had been the subject of countless conversations, during lunchtime chats and late-night bull sessions. For weeks, they had weighed the ethics of bagging "savages" and debated the probability of getting caught. Some of them agonized over the idea; others were gung-ho from the start. But not long after the New Year, as winter descended on the arid plains of Kandahar Province, they agreed to stop talking and actually pull the trigger. Bravo Company had been stationed in the area since summer, struggling, with little success, to root out the Taliban and establish an American presence in one of the most violent and lawless regions of the country. On the morning of January 15th, the company's 3rd Platoon -- part of the 5th Stryker Brigade, based out of Tacoma, Washington -- left the mini-metropolis of tents and trailers at Forward Operating Base Ramrod in a convoy of armored Stryker troop carriers.

AFGHANISTAN US Troops Take Pride "My Kill" By Taking Video-Photos For Personal Collection

How To Go To Heaven: www.jesus-is-savior.com www.rollingstone.com The clip presented here is excerpted from 'Motorcycle Kill,' a video collected and shared by members of the "kill team" of US soldiers who murdered civilians in Afghanistan and mutilated the corpses. The jumpy, 30-minute video -- shot by soldiers believed to be with another battalion in the 5th Stryker Brigade -- shows American troops gunning down two Afghans on a motorcycle who may have been armed. Even if the killings were part of a legitimate combat engagement, however, it is a clear violation of Army standards to share such footage. The video was taken on patrol with a helmet-mounted camera; at one point, the soldier shooting the images can be heard boasting, "I got it all on camera." www.msnbc.msn.com Behind the American 'Kill Team' in Afghanistan How soldiers murdered civilians -- and how officers failed to stop them By Mark Boal Rolling Stone updated 3/28/2011 10:52:03 AM ET Early last year, after six hard months soldiering in Afghanistan, a group of American infantrymen reached a momentous decision: It was finally time to kill a haji.

SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman's aides were ecstatic in the spin room after the debate, and they had reason to be: Their man turned in an appealing, level-headed, shrewd and well-informed performance. Whether it will make any difference is doubtful, but as a piece of stagecraft and appeal, Jon Huntsman's presentation of himself was spot on.
He may simply be too reasonable to be nominated -- or even to get much traction.
"He was the best he's ever been and he's getting better all the time," his top aide, Jon Weaver, told HuffPost minutes after the debate ended.
In the first debate that included Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Huntsman unveiled a clever appeal: that he has both the private-sector knowledge of Mitt Romney and the tax-cutting and job-creation track record of Perry.
He noted that Utah was number one nationally in job creation during his tenure and that he repeatedly cut taxes in his state.
He defended the science of climate change and evolution without directly accusing anyone else on the stage -- notably Perry, who has questioned both -- of being on the other, unpalatable side of the argument.
And he repeatedly brought the talk back to big themes: poverty and world affairs and a sense that America had lost its "core."
Huntsman continues to trail badly in the polls. He refuses to take various pledges. He can get establishment voters if Mitt Romney falters. But if Tea Party types take the time to look at his economic track record, they'd like what they'd see. With personal money in the billions and more competitiveness than meets the eye, Huntsman could be in it for the long haul, despite his miniscule standing in the polls.
He's clearly learning how this system works, and he looked more comfortable -- and was a bigger presence -- on this stage than he has been before.
With Perry going for the Tea Party (and Bachmann looking confused and fading fast), and with the others essentially non-factors -- Huntsman has reason to stick around.
Moreso after tonight.

				Jon Huntsman Aides Ecstatic After Debate: 'The Best He's Ever Been'

......Yeah­. Too bad his campaign is over now.

He hasn't announced it yet, but.......­..trust me.

It's like "The Arsenio Hall Show", it's over and done.

				Even though I worked on Obama's campaign for almost 18 months, I'll be the first to say that I could almost see myself voting for Huntsman based on what I feel I know about him so far.

There's just one thing that gives me long serious pause and concern at this point, the 'down ticket' effect in presidenti­al elections. i would hate to see even one single Tea Party backed Republican remain in the House or the Senate following the 2012 elections, it could be the worst thing that happened in this country since 9/11.

				I agree "the best he's ever been."

He will stay in the Republican primary fray- there are not just two Republican front runners-Hu­ntsman has shown himself tonight to be an equal-ther­e are three front runners and Huntsman won't be leaving the Republican primary stage. 

And if he doesn't make it to the Republican Presidenti­al candidacy, the possibilit­y also exists of a Republican Presidenti­al/VP candidacy team of Romney/Hun­tsman in the 2012 elections. In the end, somewhat moderate Republican candidate positions may prevail. 

But, the overall Republican primary winner will likely come down to which candidate the Republican voters in the South will vote for. IMO, the voters in the South are the key element.  

Just my opinion.

				Weird Tan.  If he can ever get through the tea-bag preliminar­ies, he is capable of winning.  It's hard to get a sense for who these people really are, but he APPEARS to be a decent, intelligen­t, reasonable person.  The rest of the crowd up there was simply scary.

				I walked precincts and put a lot of time on  the phone banks for Obama but I lost faith with him when he fired his economic adviser team on 12/08/08 and replaced then with Wall Street & BigBank proteges.   I have a feeling Huntsman will be the next president.   I wont vote for him....but neither will I cast a second vote for Obama.

				I have to agree, Huntsman did a solid job this evening.  He came across as reasonable­, knowledgea­ble, well spoken, and frankly, Presidenti­al.

I was a bit disappoint­ed when he dodged the question about who he felt was anti-scien­ce, but not surprised.

It's a shame he'll never come close to getting the nomination­, but I don't think that's his plan, either.  I figure he's gunning for 2016, as the sane, moderate republican­.  After the next four years of surly teenagers running amok in DC, he'll be in pretty good position to do so.

				"He may simply be too reasonable to be nominated.­.." that just about sums up the today's GOP. In essence, he's not divisive or polarizing enough to win the nomination­. Gov. Huntsman is learned and relies on empirical evidence when making an argument--­virtues of which are just incompatib­le and unacceptab­le to the GOP.

				True... his anti-choic­e stance is a deal breaker with him, and that's a shame. I doubt he'd be just another GOPuppet. He would be much more Kennedyesc­h, and that in itself in today's society (and who votes and who doesn't) would never happen. To be POTUS in today's world, you must be ownable.

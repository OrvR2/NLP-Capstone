Clarification advice to subscribers and EndGame forecasts made available or e-mailed to subscribers giving corrections to the prognoses of standard 'official' model tracks.


WeatherAction's long range forecast (to direct subscribers) correctly predicted the advent in region timing and track of IRENE from 7 weeks ahead** and consistently improved through EndGame forecasts on official track prognoses.
WeatherAction Tropical Storm forecasts are the best in the World - have look at  

** Irene forecast sample and results included in http://www.weatheraction.com/docs/WANews11No12.pdf and See http://www.weatheraction.com/docs/WANews11No15.pdf and links therein 



The official track projections for Irene led to unnecessary evacuation and/or disruption of  lives of tens or hundreds of thousands of people who according to the the consistent IRENE EndGame track corrections of WeatherAction were not under serious danger; while the various official projections suggested many could be in danger who were not. 

See http://www.weatheraction.com/docs/WANews11No15.pdf and links therein 


Irene Remnants will hit UK &  Ireland
WeatherAction advised, before Hurricane Irene appeared'  that September's UK+Ire forecast is important because of, among other things, the long range prediction of a deep low which will hit Britain & Ireland and which we now know is called Irene (remnants). This is included in the Brit+Ire 15-45 day ahead forecast detail available from mid August, and is further repeated in the 30day fuller detail with maps update forecast (to be) uploaded during 31 Aug. - NOW UPLOADED 31Aug This Brit & Ireland 30day (Month) Sept Forecast includes Articles on Wet & Cool UK Summer 2011 and on Hurricane Irene "brilliant" forecasts

Absolute classic. Met office basically admits that they struggle to predict the weather. It might have something to do with jetstreams and the oceans but they're not sure.

How long will it be before they work out what drives the jetstreams???

RON, Thanks. Yes Opportunist prattle on the lines Galactic Cosmic Rays are THE answer to CO2 theory is a deadly delusional trap for the Stupid. The GW lobby are the masters of deceit, brainwashing and media manipulation. The involvement of CERN and the CERN boss whispering through the megaphone of media fools 'Don't talk about the implications of THIS' is all part of the scam to get Stupidists to say 'Oh look they are hiding something it must be true'. NOT SO!! The truth is they want everyone to believe the Cosmic Ray delusion is THE alternative to CO2 and then shoot it down. It's a three minute job. Then 'Oh, so after all IT IS CO2, CASE CLOSED!'. Recall how the GWers who are massively backed by BIG OIL still portray BIG OIL as their enemy. They lie and lie and lie and lie again, delusion is their lifeblood, their whole empire is stake.  So I say ZERO TOLERANCE of delusionism and do pass on my comment on GCR as on the Delingpole blog on ClimateRealists:- http://bit.ly/nXaWiM

The post CERN debate in the Scotsman blogs yesterday was most interesting indeed. It was heartening to see the 'Greenavoidies' on the back foot and the CO2 Alarmists so rattled, but as you say Piers, we must be careful in how the might try to outflank the solar influence argument by using the galactic cosmic rays as  dead drop.

CLIVE, Thanks, interesting point. There will certainly be some big hits in Sept & October but at present we don't expect them to have winds like that of Oct 87, however we will do more investigations.
EILEEN, Thanks, Nigel Calder is a great guy and his+co-workers' work on advancing the understanding of how charged particles help cloud droplet formation is great. HOWEVER the claims - which do NOT follow from the experiments - that Galactic Cosmic Rays are the main agents of sun Earth linkage and weather and climate change is delusional nonsense. The actual observed cycles of change in the real atmosphere, as well as simple estimates of the tiny contribution they could make compared with charged particles directly magnetically channeled from the sun, destroys that extension of the theory, see my comments http://bit.ly/pJEf4z  It is NOT "THE ANSWER" to CO2. The deceitful GW-media boost it as THE contender to CO2 so they can show it fails and then claim CO2 is THE answer. CO2 fails itself

Piers, I read this article from the website, EnglishLeap.  No doubt you already know about it, but your readers will be fascinated, as I was, by its contents.  Dr Calder is definitely in your camp!

What is really in store for Britain in the autumn.  Are we in for a repeat of the October storm of 1987.  As we have had three really cold winters and the last time that has happened was 1984/85 to 1986/87.  Then we had the October storm of 1987.

Ain't read much of it yet and a lot of it is heavy going but there may be some useful ammunition there.

The year 2011 for The Netherlands so far:
- driest month of March for decades
- warmest month of April since 1706 (!)
- wettest summer for over 100 years, with on 28 June the town of Herwijnen receiving 79mm of rain in one hour (!)
- such an increase in number of whirlwinds that some weather forecasts now incorporate them in the bulletins
The weather is currently so "unpredictable" that on a single day the KNMI downscaled its forecast for the last week of August from "temperatures above normal" to "temperatures below normal". They just don't know what to say anymore.

It is nothing but protons and physics.  CO2 need not apply.

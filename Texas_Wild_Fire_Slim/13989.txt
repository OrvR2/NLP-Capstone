AGOApproximate Location

  
  32.973 latitude, -94.431 longitude Incident OverviewThe Texas Forest Service is asking people to report any suspicious activities to local law enforcement or call the TFS Arson Report Line at 1-800-364-3470. PNW IMT 2 assumed command of the Dotson Fire near Alto, TX yesterday morning. It has been added to the Northeast Texas Fire Complex, which now includes the Bear Creek Fire(40,963 acres), the Dotson Fire(1,784 acres) and the Magnolia Complex(Old Magnolia Fire - 1,447 acres, Moore Fire - 1,500 acres, and the Locker Plant Fire - 1,793 acres). The total acreage for the Northeast Texas Fire Complex is 47,547 acres as of 9/13/2011.The acreage has been listed on the individual incident pages and will not be duplicated in the 209 data on this page.Basic InformationIncident TypeWildfireCauseUnder InvestigationDate of OriginSunday September 04th, 2011 approx.   12:00 AMLocation4 miles SW of Linden TXIncident CommanderMorcom/ RisnerCurrent SituationTotal Personnel231Percent Contained85%Estimated Containment DateFriday September 16th, 2011 approx.   12:00 AMFuels Involved9 Hardwood Litter Fuels are most accurately described by TU3 fuel model, moderate load humid climate timber grass shrub. Oak and loblolly pine plantations with heavy understory of scrub oak and deciduous brush on the Bear Creek Fire.Fire BehaviorWhere flare ups occurred, fire behavior was moderate with moderate rates of spread. Risk of spotting remained high with the 90-100% probability of ignition increasing the resistance to control.Significant EventsCrews continue in efforts to secure all perimeters. Hot temperatures, low humidities, and wind are resulting in an increase in initial attack activity, which is exhausting the availability of resources.OutlookPlanned ActionsContinue to mop up hot spots and extinguish flare ups on all fires, particularly around structures and on fire perimeters. Continue to secure firelines around interior structures and on fire perimeter.Growth PotentialHighTerrain DifficultyMediumRemarksThe IMT assumed command of the Dotson Fire (1784 acres) near Alto, Texas at 0800 today. The cost of aircraft has now been included in the incident costs, causing a major increase in costs. Containment estimates for the Magnolia Complex fires have been changed to 90% to reflect risks associated with extreme weather conditions, presence of interior flare ups, and the need to secure lines around recent slop overs. The Magnolia Complex includes the Moore Fire at 1,500 acres, the Locker Plant Fire at 1,793 acres, and the Old Magnolia Fire at 1,447 acres. Changes in acres of Bear Creek and Magnolia Complex Fires are mainly reflective of more accurate mapping. Equipment and resource numbers shown in "43.Committed Resources" have decreased because of resources being dispatched for initial attack and because of discontinuing the count of volunteer fire engines/personnel and resources on short-term loan.Current WeatherWind Conditions12 mph WTemperature105 degreesHumidity14%

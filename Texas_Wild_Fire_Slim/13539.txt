The interview was done after the "This is Scientology!" event of the ministry of the interior of Hamburg, Germany. It was about the events before, during and after the conference. Sorry for bad sound quality. Subtitles were added for your convenience. ------------------------------------ Transcript: This is after the „This is Scientology!" event and I just wanted to ask you some questions. So, what happened before the event, before you got here? What difficulties did you have with Scientology just related to the event? When you heard of it, when you came here. Well, we had no difficulties in Los Angeles except for Jason. Jason's wife at three in the morning received a phone call from Tommy Davis, who you all know. And Tommy wanted to talk with Jason. And she didn't tell him until the next morning when we were at the airport. And Jason decided he wouldn't call Tommy cause he knew exactly what Tommy wanted to talk about. So we travelled to Los Angeles and when we got here and got to the hotel where we were staying, the entheta hotel in Ursula's entheta city, we noticed that several of the people who were on the plane were also at the hotel what by itself means nothing. But after a while when they are constantly near us all the time we began to wonder. When we noticed these two men repeatedly we began to obviously realise they were private investigators. The first morning we were here we learned very early that at three in the morning American Express allegedly had phoned <b>...</b>

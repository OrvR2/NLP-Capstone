Too high, January 3, 2011


By Timothy C. Purdue (Kearny N.J.)  - See all my reviews

  





This review is from: Habitrol Nicotine Transdermal System Step 1, 21mg Stop Smoking Aid Patch - 7 ea (Health and Beauty)


CVS pharmacy has the 14 patch Step 1 system cheaper than this 7 patch, and no it's NOT a sale item!

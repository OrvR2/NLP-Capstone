Adult smoking rate edges down slightly: CDC dataBy LINDSEY TANNER - AP Medical Writer | AP – 17 hrs ago





CHICAGO (AP) — Fewer U.S. adults are smoking and those who do light up are smoking fewer cigarettes each day, but the trend is weaker than the government had hoped.According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released Tuesday, 19.3 percent of adults said they smoked last year, down from about 21 percent in 2005. The rate for smoking 30 or more cigarettes daily dropped to about 8 percent from almost 13 percent during the same time period.The report only compared last year with 2005 and says the decline means 3 million fewer adults were smoking. The CDC earlier reported that the 2009 rate was 20.6 percent and rates fluctuated during the five-year period.The five-year decline was much slower than a drop seen over the previous 40 years, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Atlanta-based agency. He said any decline is a good step, but also said tobacco use remains a significant health burden."About half of all smokers will be killed by tobacco if they don't quit," Frieden said during a news briefing."You don't have to be a heavy smoker or a long-time smoker to get a smoking-related disease or have a heart attack or asthma attack," Frieden said. "The sooner you quit smoking, the sooner your body can begin to heal."The 2010 numbers are based partly on face-to-face interviews with almost 27,000 Americans aged 18 and older.Increases in federal and state taxes on cigarettes and new clean air laws are among reasons for the drop, said Dr. Tim McAfee, director of the CDC's office on smoking and health.Those positive trends have been offset by efforts from the tobacco industry, including offering discounts to consumers, McAfee said.If the slowed rate of decline continues, adult smoking rates will reach 17 percent by 2020, far higher than the government's goal of no more than 12 percent, the CDC report said.Government efforts to further reduce smoking rates include proposed graphic cigarette packaging labels, which are being challenged in court by the tobacco industry.Frieden said evidence from states with strong anti-smoking programs show that tobacco control can be effective. Rates are far below the national average in states with the strongest tobacco control programs, he noted. States with the lowest rates are Utah, at 9 percent, and California, 12 percent, the CDC report found.In a statement, American Heart Association CEO Nancy Brown said the report shows some successes but also continued disparities. Smoking was most common among low-income, less educated adults and among American Indians and Alaska natives.Matthew Meyers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a Washington-based advocacy group, said in a statement that it's too soon to declare victory when nearly one in five adults still smokes.___AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/LindseyTanner

As we smoke near nonsmokers; we impose our freedom of choice on them and meanwhile, injecting them with deadly poisons.

There is an inverse relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and IQ.

The reason the statistics show the lessening in smokers,people, is 'cause I stopped smoking about three (3) weeks ago and I used to smoke enough for four (4) people. DON'T SMOKE!

I actually saw a Fiero this weekend. I was down at the local mall. A young man got into the Fiero along with a woman and an infant. The infant was in the mother's lap...no place to put a car seat. Both mom and the guy who may/may not have been the father lit up as they were driving away. Both windows were rolled up with the air on. Seems like that ought to be child abuse to me.

If they really "cared", they would make it accountable as a schedule I drug.  You can't make the argument for tobacco without making the case for cannabis.  Selective drug prohibition doesn't work.   Cannaphobia kills, cannabis heals.  Powert to the peaceful.

If the cigarettes are so lethal, then take them off the friggin market. When you're stressed, just take a hit off your joint or do a shot of whiskey.

Hey, what about all the boozers?  Especially, those that drink and drive and kill or maim people.  We had a terrible accident several years ago.  A guy, drunk as a skunk, driving down a curvy hill, hits a car, car has 3 girls in, two die, the 3rd one, the driver is trapped in a burning car.  Her skin literally burned off, her nose, her ear, burns all over her body.  She wished to be dead and she lived and became a poster girl for mother's against drunken driving.  Oh, the guy lived.

Now, let start prohibition again.  No more booze of any kind, because booze kills.  

Let's see, what else can we ban???

Smoking is singled out because it is so lethal. Also, second-hand smoke, which is often dismissed, has been proven to be a major health problem. Don't seek to change the subject by bringing up other dangerous habits. Just because something else is as bad or worse doesn't mean you shouldn't go after smoking. It is the leading preventable cause of death. And "rights" must always be balanced against the good of society. Do you have the "right" to run red lights or drive 100 mph? No, because society has deemed these actions dangerous and irresponsible. Same with smoking.

Does any critical thinker really believe that second hand smoking danger propaganda that the anti- smokers spew?  Just look at the biased research and you will see that studies are extremely flawed and skewed.  Second hand smoke does not hurt anyone.

Paulina Porizkova: Fame According To Me


							            							            To this day, when someone taps my shoulder in a supermarket, I turn around with a pretend sigh and my hands ready to autograph, only to be asked to move.

Arianna Huffington: 2009: The Things I Want to Forget (Part Two)


							            							            Earlier this week, I offered the first part of my list of all the things from 2009 that I want to forget.  Now, as we prepare to cross the threshold into 2010, here is the second part of my compilation of 2009's political and cultural detritus, including Tom DeLay's rump-shaking cha-cha to "Wild Thing" on Dancing With the Stars, Mackenzie Phillips telling Oprah about her long-term sexual affair with her father, and the fact that Lou Dobbs latched onto the birther movement. Click here to read more of the things from 2009 I'd like to forget.  READ MORE

							        



 






Arianna Huffington: Sunday Roundup


							            							            This was not a good week for public figures with notable heads of hair.  The boyishly coiffed Tom DeLay caused jaws to drop all across America with his rump-shaking cha-cha to "Wild Thing" on Dancing With the Stars.  Breck Girl-turned-Cad John Edwards saw his already-tarnished reputation further sullied by the release of details of his affair with Rielle Hunter, including a promised post-Elizabeth rooftop wedding featuring the Dave Matthews Band.  And the idiosyncratically maned Donald Trump made headlines by allowing Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to pitch a tent on his Bedford, New York estate.  But it was follicly-challenged columnist David Broder who took the prize for the week's most ludicrous act: criticizing President Obama for "his determination to rely on rational analysis, rather than narrow decisions."  God forbid.  It was enough to make your hair stand on end. 							        



 






Rob Thomas: The Big Gay Chip on My Shoulder


							            							            Just as whites fought for African Americans and Christians for Jews, straight people must stand up and be a voice for gay people. We've been here before.							        



 






Alexis C. Jolly: How Proposition 8 Kept Me From Getting Laid


							            							            The irony that the same Mormon religion that has battled for the rights of the polygamous was at the forefront of Prop 8 aside, the Supreme Court ruled in Reynolds v. United States that the law of the land superseded the mores of a religion.							        



 






Carole Bayer Sager: Dancing With the Tea Party


							            							            Sarah Palin has recently stated that she believes that she could beat Obama in 2012.  I would have said that was ridiculous until I saw that her daughter Bristol is now heading to the finals in this coming Monday's Dancing With The Stars.							        



 






Megan Carpentier: Americans Choose Reality Television Over Patriotism on Dancing With The Stars


							            							            Niecy & Louis were safe, and we were finally able to breathe a sigh of relief that their political dance and pro-marriage equality statements didn't lose them votes in the Midwest.

				That's it!  Tell the haters they are right!  I never, ever thought of changing my sex until Chaz went on DWTS & the media blitz started.  I have an appointmen­t with my sex change doctor first thing in the morning.  I want to have the change completed before the end of this season's DWTS!  Then I'm going to contact my lawyer & sue every media outlet that published this story!  They have changed the course of my life forever.  Whopps, gotta run...got a hormone treatment in 20 minutes!

				Chaz being on DWTS is ka ching capitalism at its finest, not dissimilar to some of Huff's attention grabbing headlines.  
He's not a "star" but the producers can smell controvers­y generated ratings and dollars like bloodhound­s on an English foxhunt.
However, critics of Chaz and DWTS can always remote control their way past the carrying channe

				The hateful rhetoric being shouted from the hilltops about Chaz is disgusting and destructiv­e.  So-called "experts" are saying that this sends the wrong message.  The wrong message that's being sent is not Chaz, but the "experts", the haters.  This is a dance show, period.  Dancing comes naturally to each human being.  Just watch a baby listening to the music.  What does not come to us naturally is hatred and intoleranc­e.  That is taught, and that is the message that is being sent with the appearance of Chaz Bono on DWTS.  It is still a family show.  I would let my children watch an artful competitio­n and tell them it is about following  your heart in who you are and what you do.  If they hear the comments, I would most likely remind them that being an adult doesn't mean you don't make mistakes, nor does it mean you  are smart or right.  I will tell them to listen to the music, not the experts.

				We live in a marvelous time!! Over the past few days, I've gotten the impression that many folks would (if they could) accuse Chaz Bono and the producers of DWTS of being witches and then burn them at the stake. It's like our civilizati­on is merely a facade holding back all of the evil impulses of the basest crowd mentality. Despite this fact, Chaz will still be able to exercise her right to...dance­. Whoa!?! What next? Singing? playing the oboe? Sumo wrestling? God help our children should they somehow get the impression that they can do and be anything they want to be by watching DWTS!

				LOL! Whoops! "...exerci­se HIS right..." I still remember all the hoopla when "Chastity" was born. I've read that Chaz gets a little irritated when his mom refers to him as "she" or "her." I realized, too late to edit, that I did this in at least one other post. I guess I'll just have to keep working on my pronouns and take comfort in the fact that the transition will be much easier for me than it will be for the woman who gave birth to the [seemingly­] female child she named Chastity. It's really beautiful to see how Cher has, despite her reservatio­ns, embraced her son.

				Oh please nothing has changed, not one thing! Chaz Bono is the child of privilege. Both of her parents, the legendary duo Sonny & Cher, are loved til this very day in many circles! Couple that with the rise of high-power­ed individual­s from the same community such as Ellen, Rosie O'Donald, Jane Marie Lynch and there was no way Chaz would be denied!

				wizkid14--
Actually, we are much more in agreement than you know! When I said, "We live in a marvelous time!" I immediatel­y went on to compare this time to the Salem Witch Trials of the year 1692. I was being facetious. It was like I was saying, "The only way I can brag on today is to compare it to the dark days of the Salem Witch Trials."

As for Chaz, I would hardly call this fiasco a victory for him. The way I look at it, he'd probably have had it much worse if not for the pioneering efforts of Ellen and Rosie. Also, Jane Lynch and Ricky Martin wouldn't be as comfortabl­e as they are today if not for pioneers like Ellen. 

As for the idea of privilege, I think that's the case for everyone. There are a helluva lot more African children eating and getting medical treatment today because of the incredible work done by U2's Bono. If little old ordinary me tried to do that, it wouldn't have the same effect. So, personally­, I really don't care how privileged people like Ellen and Chaz might be because ultimately­, if we don't end up awash in the benefits, they at least trickle down...

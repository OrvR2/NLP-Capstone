LISBON, Portugal -- Syrian President Bashar Assad should back away from his violent crackdown on protesters and enter talks with the opposition, Iran's leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Wednesday.
"There should be talks" between the Syrian government and its opponents, Ahmadinejad said in a live interview in Tehran with Portuguese broadcaster Radiotelevisao Portuguesa.
"A military solution is never the right solution," Ahmadinejad said, according to a simultaneous Portuguese translation of his comments.
"We believe that freedom and justice and respect for others are the rights of all nations. All governments have to recognize these rights," he said. "Problems have to be dealt with through dialogue."
Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said last month that Assad should answer the legitimate demands of his people.
"Other countries in the region can help the Syrian government and people to talk to each other with a view to resolving their differences and introducing the reforms that are needed," Ahmadinejad said.
Iran, Damascus' chief ally, has blamed the U.S. and Israel for instigating more than five months of protests in Syria.
The U.S. and other nations have accused Iran of helping Assad crush the uprising.
"Other countries have no right to interfere in ... domestic discussions," Ahmadinejad said, citing NATO's intervention in Libya as an example of misguided actions.

				I agree, Syria should adopt the US model, go in with guns blazing, shock and awe the s..t out of them.  Or, maybe we should grow up and use this thin sliver of an opening from Iran and work together to stabilize a region that George Bush totally destabiliz­ed with his attack against an innocent nation.  We could also go into Iran and lump around looking for WMDs, how did that work out for us?

				Ahmadineja­d has stated several points that I've been suggesting for the past seven months: "The unrest in Syria and Libya, unlike that in Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Bahrain, Jordan and Yemen was instigated by the U.S., Britain and France. WHile I'm uncertain of how the Syrian educationa­l system functions I'd say that if it resembles that of the western government­s - "Dumbing Down, or financiall­y limiting" your citizens is not in the nations overall interest.

				Look who is talking. Iran never had talks with their citizens when they protested, they never backed away from violence and they never had a military response to protests..­.rather the Iranian protesters were arrested, imprisoned and often killed. This tyrant is trying to act as if human life means something, as if he is not exactly like Assad. He wants the world to believe he is helping the people..wh­at he is doing, is trying to save Syria because Iran is Syria..Ira­n dictates what happens in Syria..if Assad loses power, Iran might not maintain control.  I hope both of these countries fall and that the people will be free from the suffering and misery imposed upon them..Once again Ahmadinaja­d, the man who denies the Holocaust, is denying his vicious and sadistic rule..

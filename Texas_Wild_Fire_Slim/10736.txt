Name misspelled on 9/11 memorialSpokesman: Memorial officials regret the errorUpdated: Wednesday, 14 Sep 2011, 5:22 AM CDTPublished : Wednesday, 14 Sep 2011, 5:22 AM CDT


NEW YORK (AP) â The name of a man killed in the Sept. 11 attacks is misspelled on the memorial at the World Trade Center site. The family of Jeffrey Schreier tells WNBC-TV the R and the second E in his first name were switched on the memorial. His sister Janice Hart says she couldn't believe it when she saw the error Sunday, when the memorial opened to family members. Her brother worked in the mailroom at financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. His remains were never recovered. Memorial spokesman Michael Frazier tells WNBC the letters apparently were reversed when the name was entered into a database. He says memorial officials regret the error and are working on fixing it. The memorial opened to the general public Monday. ___ Information from: WNBC-TV,   http://www.nbcnewyork.com/   Copyright Associated Press,    Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

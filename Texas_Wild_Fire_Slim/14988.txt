         Marriage has become so scarce these days and there might be a lot of contributing factors. Evidently there are more women than men and again some people have decided not to join the institution, even those who do, do not stick around for long. Funny and dodgy strategies have been used lately by those who are still pro- marriage. Some people will tell you that if you are a young woman in search of a life partner you should socialise a lot, “ be an extrovert and stop hiding, where will he see you if you keep behind closed doors” some say. Some will tell you to relax your standards a bit, after all does this perfect MR Right we have in our minds really exists? I went to a wedding of a close friend this past weekend and while there met some interesting young women. We were just chatting about this and that when the issue of red lip-stick emerged. One lady told us that her friend decided that her boyfriend was taking forever to pop the question and she wanted to make him jealous by behaving like she was seeing someone else. She changed her hair style, bought new clothes and her secret ingredient was a red lipstick which she used from that day, took dozens of pictures and posted them on facebook almost every day. Two months down the line the much awaited question was popped and now they are happily married. Funny right, makes me wonder whether men really need a little push in the right direction or maybe women sometimes get impatient and pushy but anyway it worked for her. It might work for you too who knows or might just be a total waste of time but who cares, what do you have to loose anyway? I am just saying.        1 of 3

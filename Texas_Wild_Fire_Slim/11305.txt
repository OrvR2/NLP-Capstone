Perry a no-show in BastropWalk-through canceled, leaving some mad, confusedUpdated: Saturday, 10 Sep 2011, 9:38 PM CDTPublished : Saturday, 10 Sep 2011, 6:31 PM CDT

BASTROP, Texas (KXAN) - Gov. Rick Perry canceled a walk-through of destroyed Bastrop neighborhoods Saturday afternoon and then was a no-show a press conference where residents and media waited. His press secretary, Allison Castle, was peppered with questions by media and residents. Castle said logistical issues and a late change in the location were factors in the governor's absence. "I don't know what to think," said Frans Hendricks, a business owner who lost his home and chocolate business in the Bastrop fire. The anger and confusion of residents overshadowed the good news that FEMA officials arrived and as of Saturday, the fire is 50% contained. "We've been working with local officials to find the most appropriate location [for this press conference]," Castle told reporters.  "By the time we were able to get the location finalized and certain that this would be it, it would have taken the governor longer and we did not want to hold up the press conference." The location for the press conference at what is now a burned down chocolate shop off Highway 71 in Bastrop was announced at 3:00 p.m. Saturday.  Castle told KXAN that Perry, considered the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination next year, was in Austin, only a 25-minute drive away. "He [Perry] is in constant contact with the governor's office, with his chief of staff. We have been in touch with FEMA," Castle added. Frans Hendricks, who lost the chocolate shop and his home in the fire, was expecting Perry. "I don't know what to think [about Perry not being here]," said Hendricks.  "I've lost everything, so at the moment I have nothing. I am taking it day by day." The press conference instead turned into an update discussing vouchers being given to displaced residents to help them get out of shelters. County Judge Ronnie McDonald said 182 vouchers have already been issued. "It allows them to move past a point of destruction to try and get to some normally," said McDonald. "We realize this is going to be a long process." A parade of officials spoke to media. "This is not the end of what we are doing, this is just the beginning of a very long recovery process," explained Nim Kidd, Texas Emergency Management Chief. Meanwhile, across town, residents waiting to re-enter their neighborhoods once it is safe picked up wrist bands and placards for their cars at Wal-Mart, Tractor Supply Co., Lowe's and Home Depot. Residents must show proof of residency to get placards and wrist band.  Only resident in the Chapel Hill neighborhood have been allowed back in. Officials did confirm that 622 houses are destroyed and that number is expected to rise to more than 1,400. Danny Robbins lives on Circle D and already knows his home is still standing. "We are hanging in there you know," said Robbins while picking up a placard.  "We are trying to help out people that is less fortunate, but we can only do so much." There are now lists up at the Bastrop Convention Center where displaced residents can check by zip code if their home is still standing. Not all zip codes are up yet because fire crews are still assessing charred areas. Those who wish to file a claim with FEMA should visit their website for information or call 1-800-621-FEMA to register. Placards and wrist bands will also be available for pick-up on September 11 at the four designated location listed above.

nytimes.com:
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Judging from the popularity of the Broadway show “Boeing Boeing” and plans for a television series based on the world of Pam Am stewardesses, the public seems to long for the days when airlines prided themselves on their flight attendants and the pampering they provided.
Those days are long gone for most carriers. But some long-haul airlines are betting that service that harks back to the glory days of flying will give them an edge.

Tiffany Hawk: What You Don't Know About Flight Attendants


		                        
																They're human. Although trained to remain calm in emergency (I've fought more than one inflight fire), they still have emotions. I've worked with flight attendants who were dealing with dying family members, cheating lovers, and abusive spouses.
                            







Heather Robinson: I Was an Eyewitness to Flight Attendant Steven Slater's Rant on JetBlue #1052


		                        
																Watching Slater's rant got me to thinking: it's a shame things like this don't happen more often.   Sometimes people need to rip off their masks of social nicety and express normal feelings of frustration.

																Kendra Kalounis, the executive director of the slutty flight attendants' group, said she had canceled a tanning appointment to attend the march.

				I have flown with Emirates Airlines many times. Almost all their flight attendants are young, well groomed and good looking. Some are extremely pleasant and polite and attentive, others not so much.

But I certainly do not see why they should be accused of old school ``gamour'' ( ??!! )

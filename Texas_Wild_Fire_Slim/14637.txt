Dozens of wildfires raging in rain-starved Texas are now reported to have engulfed more than 1,000 homes.
The biggest of the blazes - which has razed about 45 sq miles (116 sq km) in rural Bastrops County - is now 30% contained after burning out of control for three days, destroying nearly 800 homes.
Fire Engine Operator Jerry Olsen said efforts were continuing to try and contain the fires, but it is already too late for many homeowners who have lost all they own to the flames.

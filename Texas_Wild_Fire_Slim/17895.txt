Yeah wouldn't have a thing to do with Libya's Transitional Government giving missiles to the Taliban and Al Qaeda.

âI had said at an eight oâclock breakfast that sometime in the next two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve months there would be an event that would occur in the world that would be sufficiently shocking that it would remind people again how important it is to have a strong healthy Defense Department that contributes toâthat underpins peace and stability in our world.â
- Donald Rumsfeld, interview with Larry King, December 5, 2001

Here they do again, crying "wolf" over some pre-imagined terrorist attack. The way one can happen today is to have the C.I.A. orchestrate one since Al Qaeda has all it can do just to merely survive! Unfortunately, the public is falling for it!

My apologies above as I meant to print "go", not "do" in my first sentence.

Oh, and by the way, FP levels have been increased every year, just not with the attention provided by the 10-year anniversary.

Patton, since you are a fan of your beloved Al-Qaeda, why don't you join them? That would solve two problems: the C.I.A. can monitor YOUR anti-American activities, and we wouldn't be blessed with your retarded rhetoric under the many names you have stolen.
"Pre-imagined?" The word you want is "imaginary".
You're not a very good troll, are you?
And no, I'm not a member of the TP, and you can understand the language very well.

Don't apologize for your typo; apologize for being such a deadly boring troll.

NYC memorial will signify not only the lives of those lost , but it also keep the threat of terrorism alive in everyone' s mind for generations to come, and  to stay guard against  terrorism in general. Long term this is not going to help the people of different races and religion unite, a discreseful wall has been created here by the Government  to condemn the Islam
Religion, and at the same time strengthen American patriotism and solidarity.

The Romans build the coliseum so the people hail to Cesaer and the Empire it worked for some years, but the Empire fail anyhow. All Government are destined to fail son or later. America is just buying time.

Yeddo ... you're a dumba$$ if you think you think terrorists had ANYTHING to do with WTC building #7. You think you're so smart, yet you seem to not have an ounce of intelligence in your entire cranium.

Terrorism is great because it allows the government to pass legislation like the Patriot Act that keeps the population in perpetual fear and dependency

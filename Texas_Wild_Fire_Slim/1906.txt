Juror gets caught adding female defendant to Facebook friend's listBy Mike Flacy | Digital Trends – Wed, Aug 31, 2011





 
When Jonathan Hudson of Arlington, Texas sent a Facebook friend request to Courtney Downing, he probably didn’t realize that it would eventually result in four charges of contempt of court. At the time of the friend request, Hudson was taking a break from delivering pizzas to serve on a Texas jury. Courtney Downing happened to be the defendant in the case that concerned a 2008 car wreck and Hudson thought it would be a brilliant idea to befriend Downing on Facebook during the trial. Downing reported the friend request to her attorney and this led the judge to dismiss Hudson from the jury immediately.
 After being dismissed, Hudson contacted Downing on Facebook yet again through the messaging system pretending to have befriended the wrong Courtney Downing. This course of action yielded no help for Hudson and he ended up pleading guilty to contempt charges last week. Hudson could have faced up to six months in prison for his actions, but the court sentenced him to 16 hours of community service to be determined by the court bailiff. 
Texas recently added specific language regarding the misuse of social media to the instructions that a judge reads to potential jurors before a trial begins. This inclusion specifically targets updating Facebook and Twitter status with details of an ongoing trial. With periods of lengthy downtime during a typical trial, jurors often turn to smartphones to pass the time.  
A similar case happened in the UK during June 2011 when a juror reached out on Facebook to the defendant facing charges around drug distribution. The illegal communication caused the entire trial to collapse and the juror faces a potential penalty for the entire cost of the trial, an astounding 6 million pounds. The juror, a 40 year old mother of three, was eventually sentenced to eight months in prison for the contempt charges.

I absolutely hate people that don't seem to remember that some of the lower class people didn't have the luxury of being able to 'blow" their way to the top. Yes... many are morons but to image everyone in the lower class as being "dumb***", or simply... "morons", entails that the ignorance pursues even in the high classes. So once again... you got lucky in "blowing" you're way to the top. Keep drinking plenty of fluids to keep the cottonmouth away.

The part I don't understand is the defendant turning him in. 
Isn't he going to vote to acquit? 
Why turn him in now? 
Why not at least wait until, (and if,) you get convicted and need an out?

What a dumb b****. She could have co** teased him into siding with her, guaranteeing a win. Now none of the jurors will like her.

I see people saying Facebook is for morons and retards and whatnot. I use Facebook to keep in touch with my friends whose numbers I do not have. There are morons who use Facebook, but Facebook was not made for morons. I love how the stupid people get all the attention, and make everyone else look bad.

All the loosers supporting Casey think they have a shot to get in her pants...not. 
Our jury system is a joke. There are little qualification to be on a jury,, basically have a pulse.

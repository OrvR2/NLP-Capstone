Did Abercrombie & Fitch’s ‘Situation’ offer inspire a Wall Street sell-off?By Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – Wed, Aug 17, 2011

While the majority of American television viewers may have thought Abercrombie + Fitch's hilarious offer to pay The Situation to stop wearing its clothes on MTV's "Jersey Shore" was a well deserved slight to an outsized reality-TV celebrity, shareholders in the company didn't find it very funny.
Shares in the teen clothing retailer fell more than 8 percent on Wednesday, a day after the New Albany, Ohio-based company released a public statement purporting that it would pay Michael Sorrentino, a.k.a "The Situation," a "substantial" sum to wear an alternative brand.
"We understand that the show is for entertainment purposes, but believe this association is contrary to the aspirational nature of our brand, and may be distressing to many of our fans," A&F's statement read.
As a result, Abercrombie and Fitch was a worldwide trending topic on Twitter on Wednesday.
"It's a clever PR stunt," MTV responded in a statement.
Perhaps not so clever. According to the Speakeasy, after Wall Street analysts "peppered executives with endless questions about inventory and gross margins" during A&F's earnings call Wednesday, CEO Mike Jeffries took it upon himself to explain the situation with "The Situation."
A&F shares closed at $64.87, down 8.66 percent for the day.
To be sure, the sell-off had more to do with Jeffries' assertion that despite posting a quarterly profit that beat estimates, A&F is "entering a period of greater uncertainty"--a shaky outlook for any company, even those that don't outfit reality stars.
But the "Jersey Shore" stunt didn't help.
Nonetheless, Jeffries told investors, "We're having a lot of fun with it."

They should be happy people were buying their clothing.  Everyone should stop buying A&F that will show them.  They are saying only a certain type of people can wear their clothing.  The Situation is popular right now and was giving A&F exposure.  They should have been thankful.

that is what i call a major insult,to say that only certain types of people should be wearing your clothing.they sound like  they haven't gotten over the days where only a certain type of person was allowed to use a stores bathroom.

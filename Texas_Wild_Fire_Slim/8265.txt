Russian jet carrying hockey team crashes, 36 deadBy by LYNN BERRY - Associated Press | AP – 20 hrs ago





YAROSLAVL, Russia (AP) — A Russian jet carrying a top ice hockey team crashed while taking off Wednesday in western Russia, killing at least 36 people and leaving one critically injured, officials said.The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said the Yak-42 plane crashed immediately after leaving an airport near the city of Yaroslavl, on the Volga River about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northeast of Moscow. It said one person survived the crash with grave injuries.The weather was sunny and clear at the time.Prime Minister Vladimir Putin immediately sent the nation's transport minister to the site, 10 miles (15 kilometers) east of Yaroslavl.The ministry said the plane was carrying the Lokomotiv ice hockey team from Yaroslavl. The team was heading to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, where it was to play Thursday against Dinamo Minsk in the opening game of the season of the Kontinental Hockey League.The KHL is an international club league that pits together teams from Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia and Slovakia.Lokomotiv Yaroslavl is a leading force in Russian hockey and came third in the KHL last year. It's coached by Canadian Brad McCrimmon and includes several international stars in its ranks, such as Stefan Liv of Sweden and Czech Republic players Josef Vaicek and Jan Marek.It wasn't immediately clear which players were on board the Yak-42 on Wednesday.Lokomotiv was a three-time Russian League champion in 1997, 2002-2003. It took bronze last season.The short- and medium-range Yak-42 has been in service since 1980 and dozens are still in service with Russian and other airlines.President Dmitry Medvedev has announced plans to take aging Soviet-built planes out of service starting next year.In June, another Russian passenger jet crashed in the northwestern city of Petrozavodsk, killing 47 people. The crash of that Tu-134 plane has been blamed on pilot error.

It's really funny how this Yahoo comment 'forum' is so full of people who have nothing better to do than to write 'Prayers to blablabla' and 'My thoughts are with them'... How about this one: I don't give a hoot in hell about those people! Never met them, don't know them, so why should I care!!? So many people die every minute, but they are not on Yahoo news, and you stupid people don't care about them, now do you? No, only if Yahoo snaps their fingers you all go into 'care & share mode' and start typing your nonsense! What a waist of time!!!

.....it is a shame....though some of you have no clue what it was like living under Russian rule in Easter Europe....having family members disappear.....killed, tortured....having your father in Siberia in a gulag for 6 years, returning as a human wreck.....then you would know that everyone is not saddened by this news..........that some are indifferent and numb

The Ultimate Goal

They skated down the tarmac
toward 30,000 feet
passing the puck to one another
between the isles of the Tu-134

The roar of the engines
sounded like the crowd on game night
as they passed center court
moving swiftly toward a wide open net

With hockey sticks in hand
they plowed into the land
scoring the last of their goals
and now they'll find out if any of them really counted at all

Well, I can see Obama giving billions to Russian now. I think Obama likes that number since he gives it to alot of other countries that hate us also.

Russian aircraft are garbage to begin with..add 35 yrs of service and poor maintenance to them..and it's a recipe for disaster.....this is a tragedy that didn't need to happen...Aeroflot has begun purchasing western built aircraft, Airbus, Boeing, MD11 Freighters,.......with proper maintenance, their safety record should improve remarkably.....

To those who wish to criticise Russian aviation, Some of the greatest innovations in flight have come from Russia, including the largest heavy lift bomber and transport ever made.

People die all the time. Why is they are only worthy of being prayed for in articles when they die in large groups in a spectacular way?   Every day, according to Blue Oyster Cult, over 40,000 men and women every day die.  Its got to be 60,000 a day by now at least.

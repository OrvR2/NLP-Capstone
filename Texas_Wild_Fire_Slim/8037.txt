Another sad attempt by a fallen star to recapture his past glory .
 Perhaps Jim Carrey, should try more dramatic roles, instead of the same old, tired performances, he's been doing for 20 years
His comedy doesn't appeal to anyone over the age of 5 yrs old ..( funny faces and slapstick, just isn't funny, when it's all you do)
Don't pull a "Crazy Charlie"... it's been done ..and it doesn't work...

This guy belongs in the puzzle palace where the rooms have rubber walls and the tailors make jackets with extra long sleeves.

Oh well, if it's his own property, then he can spray to his heart's content.  Just leave other people's stuff alone.

Another example of a person who shouldn't be a parent.  This is a bad example to the younger ones who end up being the punks that destroy property.  We end up suffering.  If only we could sue him.

I don't think there's anything odd about advertising his own website. People need to stop looking for something that isn't there.

Poor guy I think he is losing it.

He is advertising for his WEBSITE so he is trying to get attention. Wow you people are so stupid to not realise this. Plus he went through a divorce.

I have never liked this guy. He gives me the creeps. I don't find him funny at all.

I met Jim when I was 14 while he was still living in the VW van, with the family, at his uncles place. He was odd then. That's what makes Jim, Jim. Who else would stand in front of a mirror for hours to perfect a goofy expression or wear a pink tutu and speak backwards so well that when you reverse the film you can understand it. He's a Martian ..truely

lol that's one way to get your face back onto front pages and in the centre light. hadn't heard anything from him in a while. like a song says 'the more they write my name down, the more my price goes up' wether it's cause you did a good or crazy thing lol.

I thought I read somewhere he has bipolar disorder. Maybe that explains his strange behaviour.

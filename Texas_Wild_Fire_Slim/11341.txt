May 12, 2011 — LUFKIN, Texas — Firefighters from across the nation will gather next week for the 14th Annual East Texas Interagency Wildfire and Incident Management Academy.Texas Forest Service is joining with the City of Lufkin and Angelina College to host the firefighters attending the 10-day academy that kicks off May 17.Courses offered at the academy are part of a standardized, national training curriculum developed by the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, an organization that facilitates coordination between participating wildfire management agencies.The coordinating group also teaches the incident command system, a standardized method for managing an incident safely and effectively. Classes include dozer operations, GPS orientation, resource ordering and firefighter training at beginner and advanced levels. Knowledge and expertise of wildland fire fighting increases the capacity of local firefighting resources and strengthens protection efforts.“A key benefit of the wildfire academy is that personnel from state, federal and local agencies can come together and share experiences as well as expertise,” said Meredith McNeil, Texas Forest Service business coordinator and Wildfire Academy registrar.

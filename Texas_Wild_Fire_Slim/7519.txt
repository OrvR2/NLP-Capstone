'Brat Pack' actor Anthony Michael Hall arrestedBy Tim Kenneally | Reuters – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Perhaps Anthony Michael Hall was attempting to re-assert his status as a member of the Brat Pack over Labor Day weekend.
The actor -- perhaps best known for such '80s John Hughes fare as "Sixteen Candles" and "The Breakfast Club" -- was arrested on suspicion of disturbing the peace and taken into custody Monday night, after allegedly engaging in a disturbance at his Playa del Rey, Calif., condominium complex, the Los Angeles Times reports.
The actor, 43, was arrested at approximately 9:50 p.m. after Los Angeles Police Department officers were called to the residence. Hall's neighbor told police that the actor had torn up plants in the common area of the condominium. When confronted, the neighbor claimed, Hall hurled an obscenity and threatened to beat the neighbor "to a pulp."
Hall was transported to the LAPD Pacific Division Jail, where he posted $500 bail and was released.
Hall, who has made a couple of guest appearances on NBC's "Community" in recent years, also had a part in 2008's "The Dark Knight," as "Gotham Tonight" host Mike Engel.

They mentioned nothing about Dead Zone, he was the main character in that series, I would have mentioned that if I wrote this article, I didn't write it so there is my two cents....

"He hurled an obscenity." Wow, didn't the guy duck ? You mean it hit him that hard and knocked him down ? #$%$ And seriously, what happened to just giving people misdemeanor citations ? Arrested on suspicion ? Cities must be hurting for money. Although, this also must have been more PR, I'm sure we can expect to see Hall in a new movie or series shortly.

It's not so bad. We don't know that he was drinking or doing drugs. Why do people seem to think he's living in the past? Give the guy a break, maybe he got fired, or his grandma died, or he's getting a visit from the IRS, so like anyone he took his frustration out on something (could have been someone). then he yelled at the neighbour. really, it's not like he pulled a knife or shot someone.

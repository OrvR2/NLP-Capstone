         The ex President of Libya Col Moammar Qaddafi is not traceable, his latest message was aired once again on a friendly TV station, in which he again said that he will fight till death. On the other hand NTC forces though controlling most of the Libya now, is facing stiff resistance from the pro-Qaddafi forces at Bani Walid and Sirte.  But at the same time future lines are being drawn by the new leadership. In a first public address in Tripoli, the NTC supremo said that Libya will be a "moderate islamic state". He was addressing to a large gathering which had come to greet him on the victory of NTC to oust the ex President Col Qaddafi. Mr. Mahmoud Jibril while addressing a charged crowd said "We are a Muslim nation, with a moderate Islam, and we will maintain that". He went on to say " the NTC would not accept extreme right- or left-wing ideologies". Nearly 10,000 people had gathered in the martyr's square to listen to Mahmoud Jibril's short speech, unlike Col qaddafi's long sermon. This speech will put an end to those murmuring which talked of a secular Libya.        1 of 8        
Future ideology of Libyan state is being discussed everywhere

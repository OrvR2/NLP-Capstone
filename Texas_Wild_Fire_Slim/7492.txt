Wow - this show seems really necessary.  A can't miss. 16 designers making belts and purses. This isn't a totally mediocre idea at all.

I LOVE Molly Sims.  Thought she was actually a pretty good actress on that show Las Vegas. I watch the reruns all the time and for being a model turned actress she did a pretty good job.

well there's a mistake. You can't water down and spin off everything and be successful. How about some creativity?

I think the suggestion of a Project Runway for men's clothing was actually brilliant.  This is something i would watch simply because it would be different.l

Really? The cutthroat world of accessories?  Unless the make em fight in a cage with what ever purse or belt they create I dont think many people will be watching this.  On the bright side no Kardashians are attached...

gfg. Now let's have a "reality show" about whether iguanas think it's OK to wear white after Labor Day. See, it's a competition where viewers vote every week and the lizards have to...

when are TV networks going to actually get creative?  By spewing out re-hashes of all their best shows they're watering down the quality of the originals while also adding total crap that no one wants to watch to their lineup.  

Project Runway is a total "guilty pleasure" that I got into because of my wife, and while I like the idea of "Project Runway: Mens Clothing", just like this show about the accessories, there just isn't the real market for watching it. I can't imagine even watching this upcoming show WITH guilt.  Pretty sure it's going to be GARBAGE.

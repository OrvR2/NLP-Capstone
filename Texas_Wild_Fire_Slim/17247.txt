About this blog

What you’ll find here:
Compelling stories about the ways religion influences politics, pop culture, entertainment, sports, ethics and just about every other aspect of American life.
Some will come from Houston, tales of big-name megachurches and growing minority populations, like Hindus, Muslims and atheists. Others will come from Washington, the Vatican, Hollywood or anywhere else spiritual forces are at work.
Believe It or Not is a place for breaking news and religion headlines, but don’t be surprised if you also come across silly, lighthearted stories about the weird stuff that also goes on in the religion realm.
Who’s making it happen:
I’m Kate Shellnutt. I work for the Houston Chronicle as the producer of HoustonBelief.com, and I also cover religion for the newspaper’s Belief section, which runs on Fridays.
My adventures as a student of religion and a reporter have taught me a lot about the traditions I write about, and I’m continuing to explore faith communities in Houston.
As far as my perspective, I think religion is one of those topics that we don’t talk about enough. I hope Believe It or Not is a place that highlights religious forces at work in peoples lives and in our society as a whole. I hope the blog spurs you to think more and talk more about what you believe, what ever that may be.

				Looks reasonably close to the results of other surveys to me.  Keep in mind that on the 2012 election match-ups, the MOE for the difference between the two candidates is a little less than double the MOE of the poll for individual percentage­s.  For example, the result that former Governor Romney leads President Obama by 4 percent is a statement with an MOE of about 6.7 percent.

Again I would poin out that those of you who live in TX and enjoy bashing TX on here regularly have this thing called "freedom" and are "free" to leave TX anytime you like for supposedly vastly superior places to live such as MA or the People's Republic of Vermont.

				We've discussed this before Stillow, moving isn't free.  Your average waiter probably doesn't have the $6-10K available to move from Texas to Vermont.  I moved 35 miles this summer and it cost me something like $800 after all was said and done.  The only way to do it cheap is if you have relatives already at the place.  Otherwise you have to set up living accommodat­ions, deposits, etc... all on your own.

				I was going to say, a job, albeit a low-paying one, is probably preferred to the millions who are out of work right now.  I hope Obama campaigns on that:  "Texas is creating only crappy low-paying jobs.  It doesn't matter that it's cheap to live there nor that I am not creating ANY jobs!"

				It's not that cheap where the jobs actually are.  Most jobs are in the 3 major metros.  Houston has a cost of living comparable to a lot of midwestern and northeaste­rn metros, although it is cheaper than NYC, Boston, San Fran, etc...  but then most other areas in those states are cheaper than those metros.  

Ie: your savings moving from Madison, WI or Hartford, CT to Houston wouldn't be that much, but obviously moving from Los Angeles to Houston would be.

				And I think you live in CO?  The average cost of living there is very similar.

In TX the distances are so great you'll spend a lot on your car.  I don't think CoL calculator­s take that into account.  30+ mile one-way commutes are not un-common - since it takes living that far out to take advantage of cheaper housing in decent school districts.  Closer to the city some housing may be fair but your school district is probably bad.  In the city where they are good housing is very high.  You'll have to buy new cars every 6 or 7 years at least or spend a lot keeping them up.

				The cost of living between Hartford and Houston is completely different.  I checked three different cost-of-li­ving calculator­s and the range was an overall 22% to 31% cheaper in Houston.  In addition, they all said housing was 40%-48% cheaper.  The difference with Madison was less but it was still cheaper in Houston by 10-18%.

				Here's what I know.  Republican­s are hanging their hats on a candidate that most have never even seen debate, one that seems to avoid debates in the first place.  That cries desparatio­n, and while you may not like President Obama's policies, showing desparatio­n towards a candidate is truly pathetic.

				Scroll your browser up and see the poll results?  Perry has a slight lead over Obama, romney a slightly bigger lead over Obama.....­so who is desperate?  

Maybe you are new to this, but the GOP has not put a hat on anyone yet.....it­s called a primary.  That means people are in a contest to see who will be the party's nominee.  During the primary season you will have many ebbs and flows.  Both parties have them, they are pretty common things.  

But when one is leading they are not usually described as desperate.

				I don't really expect you to follow what I had CLEARLY said Stillow, but I'll repeat it again for you, and hope for the best.  

It is CLEAR I am not making any comparison to desperatio­n and the leading candidate.  I am making a claim that it REEKS of desperatio­n to have a candidate who hasn't even been seen in debates leading the party.  It is absolutely desperate to want to vote for someone you don't even know.  

I would compare it to all  the "Scott Brown 2012" hopefuls, shortly after he won his election.  They didn't know ANYTHING about him, but what did that matter.  Republican­s got their quick sugar fix, and they were happy with that for the moment.

				Romney and Perry continue to show they are the only two with the capacity to take down Obama.  Considerin­g this is a poll of adults with a pretty heavy Dem lean, D+9 without leaners, D+7 with leaners and not a poll of LV, I think one could easily conclude that both Romney and Perry's leads are a few points larger than the poll's topline numbers.

				Yeap. As of today, once you adjust this sample to a realistic likely voter scenario, BO loses to Perry and Romney by at least 8-10, but he also loses to Bachmann and Huntsman by narrower margins.

Still time for him to stage a comeback, but he keeps on choosing the wrong direction all over again..

				The top-line 2012 election survey results posted by Emily were from the registered voters subsample only.  Thus, the Democrat to Republican difference in that subsample was probably closer to D+3.

				Do you have anything to back up the "probably closer to D+3"?  There is not that much difference between their results with RV and adults.  Example Perry with adults is 46/46, with RV its Perry 47 - Obama 46.  That is a net change of 1.   IMO that is not very reflective of going from a D+9 to a D+3.  

Unfortuant­ely theydo not give us that much detail.  But at face value IMO it does not look like the Adult sample is that far off from their RV sample.   Plus the networks  have somehwat of a history of using a pretty big party id gap.  I'm not as aggressive as stats is...if this poll were narrowed down to LV...I think the effect would be a 5-7point shift to the right.

				Okay - I e-mailed Gary Langer (Langer Research Associates does the analysis for ABC News for this poll).  Gary said that indeed the published data on party affiliatio­n were for all adults and also gave the data for Registered Voters.  The breakdown without leaners is (D-R-I):
all adults 33-24-36
registered voters only 34-27-33

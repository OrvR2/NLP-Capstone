BASTROP, Texas (AP) - Firefighters gained ground on Wednesday against one of the most destructive wildfires in Texas history even as the number of homes lost reached almost 800, and an elite search team set out to find any victims in the smoking ruins. 
Governor Rick Perry, meanwhile, resumed his presidential campaign after rushing home over the weekend to deal with the crisis, travelling to California to meet his Republican rivals on Wednesday night in his first nationally televised debate. 
The blaze has left at least four people dead and blackened about 116 sq km around Bastrop and cast a haze over Austin, 40km to the east, where the air smelled strongly of pine and cedar. 
Firefighters reported that the flames were at least 30 per cent contained after burning uncontrolled for three days. They credited an easing of the winds from Tropical Storm Lee that had caused the fire to explode over the weekend. Nevertheless, the number of homes reported destroyed rose from around 600 the day before.

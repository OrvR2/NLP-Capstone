Riley Road fire has 3 pet monkeys on the lam

Grimes County Sheriff Don Sowell said he hopes the use of a DC-10 plane dropping fire retardant reinforces the bulldozers that worked through the night to contain the active fire inside an earthen berm.

Firefighters made more progress battling the massive blaze on the Grimes County border Sunday, but, just as they were starting to gain control, a new problem popped up -- monkeys.
Authorities said three primates were on the loose in the area after a Waller County landowner set them free while evacuating last week. The animals initially were believed to be harmless, but the Grimes County Sheriff's Office warned residents that they could be dangerous. Officials were told that a game warden was bitten while trying to corral one Sunday morning. 
Exact details of the incident couldn't be confirmed, though the injury wasn't believed to be severe, Grimes County officials said. Regardless, authorities are warning residents to be careful and call animal control if they see the animals.
Many residents who were forced to hastily evacuate and couldn't take their pets opted to let their animals loose instead of risking trapping them in the fire, authorities said. As a result, animal control officers have been busy trying to round up stray pets and livestock. 
Meanwhile, authorities reduced the estimated number of acres burned in the blaze Sunday to 18,468. The number was dropped due to more accurate GPS measurements, the Texas Forest Service reported. At last count, 60 structures -- 59 homes and one business -- had been destroyed. Another 23 structures were damaged. 
Mild winds allowed authorities to keep the fire from spreading. The blaze still is considered a threat, but most of the danger is now outside Grimes County in Montgomery and Waller counties, authorities said. 
"We are through with it here for the most part," said Grimes County Sheriff Don Sowell. "We are probably going to shut our command post tomorrow. Waller County is still going to evacuate, though, they still have a lot of areas of concern."
Almost all evacuations have been lifted in Grimes County, except for two subdivisions off Riley Road that can only be accessed through roads in Waller County.  
Nearly 700 people have battled the fire since it started on Sept. 5.

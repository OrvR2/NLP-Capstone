"I Married A Beautiful Woman." Roger Moore (James Bond) tells me. Wow I was over 200 lbs. then... 150s now. That was FOUR years ago, and I had less, and bad hair wow!  See THIS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP5dl67d860 Rick Dees. A Class Act! "Live Fearless with Sam Botta" Clip from Dees Entertainment Studios - Father's Day be reminded that great men still exist. If you are having difficulty meeting him, you've not met my friends yet. But then again, my male friends are people that are in constant learning, constant growth, they know why they are on the earth and the do their purpose, it's like the music you've got inside and they just can't keep it in. I have written extensively about this topic and I've been told that I've helped more than a few women see Mr. Right for the first time...James Bond in seven films from 1973 to 1985 And the counterintuitive answer by Roger Moore: I Married A Beautiful Woman. As Father's Day Approaches, be reminded that great men still exist. If you are having difficulty meeting him, you've not met my friends yet. But then again, my male friends are people that are in constant learning, constant growth, they know why they are on the earth and the do their purpose, it's like the music you've got inside and they just can't keep it in. I have written extensively about this topic and I've been told that I've helped more than a few women see Mr. Right for the first time. This is not that difficult, but there is so much to say about it. So I'll load the video and go for a swim instead. If you want these secrets, however, visit my little website and send me an email through there www.livefearless.com - let's be friends and hopefully you'll see things you've never thought of that can bring you those moments of excitement every day. I can't wait to get up each day knowing what I have to look forward to, but there were some changes I had to make. Change isn't easy, but I knew, for instance, that the Agents probably did care about the fact that I had added fat. Seventy Four pounds later, the picture has changed and motion pictures are in the works. What is it for you, I changed my eating (and actually ate more than before, and exercised LESS, during the rapid fat loss), but other habits, like learning body language and its importance... these took time and work. But as I do now, there are outcomes I had, and more I have, and I know I'll reach them. Now that's incentive. It's James Bond Roger Moore-Dad-Daddy-Family Guy not Co-Starring in The Girl with Dragon Tattoo with Daniel Craig by placement with CAA WME The Agent. The science of online dating ex. Eharmony, Free Chemistry Weekend, Match, etc,  Looking at it all, the interview, Apple Concert Video Lady Gaga, Britney, Katie Perry, the reminder is that Roger Moore has Talent. You too! A Gift, Skill, and today, Do you speak fearlessly? www.livefearless.com

Oh, Beatrice. You were doing so well. 
After bombing spectacularly at the Royal Wedding in that squiggly Philip Treacy hat, you hired Emma Watson's stylist at a cool $2,400/day rate to polish your sartorial rep.
And it worked -- for a while. Then you stepped out last night and blew the style cred to shreds.
Princess Beatrice and her sister Princess Eugenie both donned shiny outfits on Monday night to celebrate the late Freddie Mercury's would-be 65th birthday. 
Partying with Queen's Roger Taylor and Brian May, the royal sisters wore both colorful cocktail dresses and black high heels.
Bea chose a glossy purple dress with appliqued flowers with sheer black sleeves attached, topping the outfit off with giant, heavy silver becklance.
Her younger sister Eugenie wore a red dress with a sparkly silver shrug thrown over her shoulders. She also sported neon orange nails.
We're not sure what to make of the two get-ups... except that we're pretty sure Princess Beatrice's fancy shmancy celebrity stylist didn't pick them out. 
Check out the sisters below.

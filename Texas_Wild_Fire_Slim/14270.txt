George W. Bush won’t join President Obama at Ground Zero wreath-laying tomorrow

Former President George W. Bush has reportedly declined President Obama‘s invitation to join him at a wreath laying ceremony at the 9/11 Memorial tomorrow. Instead, he plans to attend a 10-year anniversary event in September.
Bush has received bipartisan thanks following Sunday’s assassination of Osama bin Ladin. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi personally thanked Bush yesterday, acknowledging his efforts in the bin Laden hunt. “He is a very friendly person, as you know, and he thanked me for my call,” Pelosi said. “And I think he appreciated it. But I wanted him to know the appreciation that many of us have in a bipartisan way.  We have all recognized in our public comments that his role was important in having this success.”
Conservative commentator Michelle Malkin urged Bush to reconsider, calling Obama’s invitation an “act of political maturity, good faith, and transcendent unity.”
Following the wreath laying ceremony, Obama will meet privately with 9/11 family members and with first responders.

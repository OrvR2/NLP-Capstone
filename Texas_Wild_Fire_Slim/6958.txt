Our Neighbors: Boy Scouts


Tweet


















  
Austin David Jones, Mark Nicholas "Mac" McAuliffe and Patrick Edwin McAuliffe recently earned the prestigious Eagle Scout Award, the highest award offered by the Boy Scouts of America.
Only two percent of all Scouts nationwide achieve this honor. 
Each of these young men, as members of Troop 976 sponsored by Central Baptist Church Men's Ministry, has earned at least 21 merit badges, served in several leadership positions and organized, planned and led others in completing an Eagle Scout Service Project to benefit the community. 
Liz Jones and Liz McAuliffe pinned the Eagle Scout medals on their sons. David Jones and Mark McAuliffe, who are both Eagle Scouts, also participated in the presentation to their sons.
Scoutmaster Charles Sanders and former Scoutmasters Paul Ask, Gary Manthei and Tim Konderla presented the awards.

                        Note: The specific link may be OK, but the webhost may be the issue. For example, if you are trying to visit a blog or page on some webhost, the specific site or blog may be benign, but because the host/company won't work with Myspace security to block other malicious sites on their domain, we are sometimes forced to block the entire domain.

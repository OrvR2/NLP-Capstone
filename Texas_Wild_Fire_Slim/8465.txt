New York prosecutors widen Goldman probe: reportBy Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore | Reuters – Wed, Sep 7, 2011

(Reuters) - New York prosecutors are widening their investigation into the manner in which Goldman Sachs  marketed certain mortgage-linked securities before the financial crisis, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The Manhattan district attorney's office began its probe into Goldman following the release in April of a U.S. Senate subcommittee report into the causes of the financial crisis, the paper said.
The district attorney's office has issued subpoenas to Morgan Stanley  and other investors in the deals. The prosecutor's requests to investors, including some hedge funds, concern how Goldman sold the deals, the Journal said.
Subpoenas do not indicate wrongdoing. They are formal requests for information and do not necessarily mean charges are forthcoming or likely.
A spokeswoman for Manhattan district attorney's office declined to comment on the Journal report to Reuters. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment to the Journal. The bank could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours.

Goldman probe? It's just for show.

Exactly. The probe is probably more about exonerating them, given that they had their ex- CEO Paulsen hoodwink Duhbya into creating TARP, and making sure they survived while they bitter rivals would not get the same interest-free loans.

Maybe they should bring in George Soros to figure out how to fix this thing.  He is a bank.  He seems to know how to make or steal money.

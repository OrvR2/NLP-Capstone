4 killed in religious rioting in central NigeriaAP – Mon, Aug 29, 2011





JOS, Nigeria (AP) — Authorities say at least four people were killed in a riot in a central Nigerian city that is beset by religious and ethnic tensions.Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency said the fighting began Monday in Jos after Muslims began praying in a predominantly Christian neighborhood in the city. Officials with a local Muslim group said the unidentified attackers used knives, machetes and bows and arrows.Witnesses say more than 50 vehicles and 100 motorcycles were set ablaze during the fighting. Army and police moved into the affected neighborhood late Monday.Jos sits in the Nigeria's "middle belt," where dozens of ethnic groups vie for control of fertile lands and political and economic power. Nigeria is largely divided into a Christian south and Muslim north.

I have an idea...Get all of the Christians together and draw a line between them....everybody pray to the God of their choice and if one of the others God tells them to kill the other then you know there is no God ...but just a false profit....

There is something seriously wrong with all religious people.  The only things you people seem to due is scam money, sodomize little boys and kill people.  What is wrong with you?

You never hear about NRA members shooting, hacking with machetes, or shooting arrows at each other.  I don´t know why people just can´t sit back, have a beer, light up a good cigar, and enjoy life.  P

Christian terrorists? No! Tell me it isn't so. Only Muslims can be terrorists.

For all of you morons who obviously can't read but feel competent enough to vomit out your stupidity through your fingertips on a keyboard: this is a story about despicable, alleged CHRISTIANS attacking a group of Muslims at prayer. And I am a Christian, by the way.

Verily it doth say in the bible of the christians that god and his son shall one day put on their HOLY boxing gloves and beat up the other false and not nice gods of the muslims.  Asmodeus; Chapter 2, Verse 7.   All religions are false.  All 'holy' books are fiction.  Sorry, buds, and there is no 'Santa Claus'!!  You morons are killing eachother and no 'devils' or 'angels' are doing the killing, just YOU religious nut-cases.  PLEASE quickly kill eachother.  :)  And have a nice day, eh?!

True Christianity is based one Gods righteousness through Jesus and not mans own effort, all religions are based on self righteousness not Gods righeousness, christianity is based on relationship with a living God all religions are based on no relation with the only True Living God.  Christianity is not about religion it is about relation with God through Jesus, God himself supplyng the covenant, the sacrifice to restore man to himself as first was in the garden of eden ! God created man for relationship on religion !

Romans 3:4  God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. Jesus paid for our sins already he is Gods salvation and by his grace we are saved. There is only One True God and he does not promote murder through Jesus but love and acceptance

If  there is any argument why religion (all religion) should be outlawed, this is it.

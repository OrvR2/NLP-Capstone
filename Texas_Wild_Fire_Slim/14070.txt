Syrian official denies targeting peaceful protestersBy admin – June 28, 2011Posted in: News


  
Damascus, Syria (CNN) — An adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said Tuesday that the government is not trying to attack protesters, despite reports from human rights activists that hundreds have been killed in a months-long uprising and crackdown in the country.
“We’re not targeting demonstrators. I think peaceful demonstrators have made their point, and they are making their point every day. We have no problem with that,” Bouthaina Shaaban told CNN. 
“Security forces are there against armed groups. They are not there against peaceful demonstrators.”
Shaaban said that while demonstrators have “legitimate grievances,” there are extremists who are using protests “as a cover to incite sectarian violence in Syria.” 
Rami Abdelrahman, head of the London based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told CNN on Tuesday that 1,342 civilians and 343 security personnel have died since the protests erupted in mid-March.
 
 
 Videos belie Syrian regime’s denial
 
For its part, a Syrian military spokesman said Sunday that more than 400 police officers and government troops and police have been killed battling “armed gangs.”
CNN cannot independently verify the death tolls.
When asked whether the crisis would have been different had security forces not acted violently during the uprising’s start in Daraa, Shaaban said she thinks “there are lots of fabrication about the security forces” and that many security forces were ordered not to carry weapons in Daraa. 
Syria’s embattled government allowed a group of activists and intellectuals, including some it had previously jailed, to hold a conference on democratic reform Monday at a Damascus hotel.
“We must change this tyrannical regime to a democratic, civilian one,” said Louay Hussein, a writer and onetime political prisoner. “How that transition happens is a question this conference is trying to address.”
Hussein said the conference would “not necessarily” find an answer to that question, “But that is the big question in this country now.”
About 200 Syrian dissidents gathered in the hotel ballroom, including several signatories of a 2005 declaration that called for a democratic transition. But some of those who have been risking arrest or bodily harm as al-Assad tries to suppress a wave of anti-government protests said the people in the hotel don’t necessarily speak for them.
“The big question regarding this conference is, where are the young people?” asked Wissam Tarif, a pro-democracy activist based outside Syria. “Where are the people who are on the streets? Where are the voices of the people who are from Daraa, or from Douma, or from Jisr al-Shugur, or from Idlib? I think those are the voices that have been missed so far.”
Shaaban acknowledged that those at the conference were not representative of the protesters on the streets. 
“That’s very true. And this is our biggest problem and our biggest challenge,” she said. “We are trying our best to reach the leaders of people on the street because we want to solve this problem in our country and move forward.” 
The al-Assad family has ruled Syria since 1971, with Bashar al-Assad taking power after his father’s death in 2000. He held out a promise of reforms and a “national dialogue” in a speech last week that was met with widespread skepticism.
The Syrian president has faced growing criticism from leaders in the United States, Europe and elsewhere over his government’s violent clampdown on demonstrators. Al-Assad has repeatedly blamed “armed gangs” in explaining its military crackdowns, which have pushed thousands of Syrians to flee to Turkey. 
The Turkish government said Tuesday that 10,757 Syrian refugees have crossed the border. It also said 441 Syrians had returned on their own will in the past two days.  
Security sources in Lebanon told CNN that about 1,000 Syrians have crossed into Lebanon near the town of Hermel.
CNN’s Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.

They were CHRISTIANS, using the same holy book to justify stopping one group marrying as you try to use to stop another group.

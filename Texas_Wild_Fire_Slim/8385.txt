Armitage replaces injured Cueto for EnglandBy STUART CONDIE - AP Sports Writer | AP – 9 hrs ago

DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) — England picked Delon Armitage for its World Cup opener against Argentina on Saturday after winger Mark Cueto failed to recover from a back injury.Having been ousted from fullback by the emergence of Ben Foden, Armitage was selected out wide Thursday as one of 10 players making their World Cup debut against the Pumas."There's a gray area between injured and fit, where most players sit all the time," England team manager Martin Johnson said. "We know Delon has been around for a few years now and we know when he's in good form and good nick. I've no qualms about picking him in any of those back three positions."Mike Tindall again leads the side in the absence of the injured Lewis Moody and links up in the centers with Manu Tuilagi. Matt Banahan provides cover for both wing and center from the bench."We just thought Delon is in very good form and he deserves his shot. We could go with Matt on the wing and even Manu there."The only other change to the side that beat Ireland in last month's last warmup is the return of Nick Easter at No. 8. That means James Haskell switches back to the openside flank, where Johnson hopes to be able to put Moody later in the tournament.Jonny Wilkinson keeps the No. 10 jersey to start his fourth World Cup at flyhalf, with the returning Ben Youngs on the bench to leave Richard Wigglesworth at scrumhalf."There's not a drop off in any of the positions," Johnson said. "Jonny's got his nose in front for this game but that may change next week. It's a good decision to have to make."___England: Ben Foden, Chris Ashton, Manu Tuilagi, Mike Tindall (captain), Delon Armitage, Jonny Wilkinson, Richard Wigglesworth; Nick Easter, James Haskell, Tom Croft, Courtney Lawes, Louis Deacon, Dan Cole, Steve Thompson, Andrew Sheridan. Replacements: Dylan Hartley, Matt Stevens, Tom Palmer, Tom Wood, Ben Youngs, Toby Flood, Matt Banahan.

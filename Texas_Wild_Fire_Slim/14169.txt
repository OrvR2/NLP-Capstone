Perry Proves He Won't Shy Away From His Faith
He speaks comfortably about it at Falwell's Liberty University

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry's speech at Jerry Falwell's Liberty University today made one thing clear about the Texas governor: He will "not shy away from cloaking his candidacy in his Christianity," writes Philip Rucker in the  Washington Post . In fact, he "presented his life in deeply spiritual...

HPV Vaccine-Maker Merck, Perry Cozier Than Claimed
Made major donations to Republican Governors Assocation

(Newser) -

(Newser) -
                                    Many pundits are saying Rick Perry’s  views on Social Security  could be his biggest problem as he campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination, but the Texas governor isn’t backing down.

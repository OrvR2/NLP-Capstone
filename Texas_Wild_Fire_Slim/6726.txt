Firefighters respond to report of smoke on A&M campus


Tweet


















  
Firefighters and Texas A&M police were responding Monday afternoon to a report of smoke in the Heaton Registration Center on campus.
Emergency officials received a report at 2:17 p.m. of smoke coming from the second-floor mechanic room of the building, 444 Ross St., and firefighters were searching for the source of the smoke 20 minutes later, College Station Fire Department spokesman Bart Humphreys said. 
Someone had pulled the fire alarm, and university police were assisting with evacuating the building when firefighters arrived, Humphreys said. 
No injuries have been reported.

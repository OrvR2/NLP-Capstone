        According to report former military dictator Pervez Musharraf in his Chinese Television interview said that Pakistan would have faced the combined military might of the US and India if it had not allied itself with America in its war against terrorists after 9/11.  Mr. Musharraf in an interview from his exile in Dubai on China’s state-run CCTV released by Chinese news agency categorically said I do not regret at all. I think it was a very right decision and if I am told for the same situation I will take the same decision. Mr. Musharraf wrote in his “In the line of Fire” that the US had threatened to bomb Pakistan into stone age if it had not agreed to become it ally in the war against terrorist following the 9/11 attack. .        1 of 3

All sorts of crime...
Aug 28, 2011 | Share
If your looking for something to add to your fall reading list, you might wanna pick up my new friend Frank Bill's new book "Crimes In Southern Indiana". The book will be hitting the public on August 30th (this coming Tuesday). There are some dark and gritty tales within these page, but seeing how your reading this on my site, it should be par for the course. A sneak peak of the book is included in the Sept 2011 issue of Playboy magazine, and Frank has been given plenty of praise. Click on the book cover right now to get your order in! I'm waiting with great anticipation for this book after reading some of Frank's other works online!

Head over to Frank Bill's House Of Grit and bookmark it to your favorites!

It's almost that time of year: Miss Universe time!
We know you were waiting with bated breath.  
89 beauties from across the globe have arrived in Sao Paulo, Brazil to compete in Donald Trump's Miss Universe pageant on September 12. But amongst the contestants there has already been some controversy: Catalina Robayo, the reigning Miss Colombia, has scandalized the organization by making official appearances in mini skirts... sans underwear.
FOX News reported the story, quoting a source that said, "Colombia had to be spoken to and told she needed to wear underpants as what she was doing was totally inappropriate... People have been pretty upset by it; there have been photos and media appearances where she has completely had her crotch out."
Yikes. What, is the weather too hot in South America for undies? 
It's actually not the first controversy Robayo's been involved in. According to Spanish sources, Robayo briefly earned a Miss Colombia 2009 title after the original winner, Diana Salgado, was forced to hand over her crown (whether it was a medical issue or a weight gain issue that caused Salgado to relinquish her crown is unclear).
Now Robayo has earned her own way to Miss Universe... but she may put her chances at risk. 
President of the Miss Universe Organization Paula Shugart told FOX, "Our supervisors talked to all of the contestants about dressing appropriately, and one of our PR people spoke to [Robayo] and apparently she said she was wearing underwear. But regardless, it created quite a stir here for a few days."
A great, publicity-brewing stir. We're sure they've loved every minute of it. 
See pictures of Robayo (presumably) wearing her panties below in the 2010 Miss Colombia pageant.

				underwear sucks, another layer, and this one with elastic...­it could fit just fine, then after a couple of hours the elastic starts to be annoying. They get smaller all the time, and the smaller they get, the more annoying cos then the elastic etc has to be just right. Scroooooo it.

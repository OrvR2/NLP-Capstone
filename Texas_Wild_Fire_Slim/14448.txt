Guest Post; Recent Studies Showing Health Risks For Firefighters
3 comments






Submitted by T. Durdan

When we think of the dangers of a firefighter, we often think of their moments of rescue, running into burning buildings and the possible dangers and wounds that may follow. Certainly these situations present major problems for firefighters all the time, but these can be just the tip of the iceberg as far asthe risks that can come along with being a firefighter.
Researchers have found that firefighters are often at a higher risk in developing testicular cancer,lymphoma, prostate cancer, and myeloma than the normal population. This expanded risk of other diseases involves when firefighters remove their protective gear after leaving a damaged or burning building. When they take off their equipment they could still be in the vicinity of many dangerous areas. Even being in the vicinity of burning or damaged structures can lead to inhalation and exposure to
carcinogenic toxins regularly.
Dr. James Lockey of the University of Cincinnati has taken extensive looks in the past few years into the correlated risk of health problems with firefighters. It was taken on nearly 110,000 firefighters and researched the correlation to around 20 different types of cancer. The percentages of risk varied, but in many cases, they were frightening. For example, there was a 100 percent increase of risk for testicular cancer and 50 percent for lymphoma and multiple myeloma.
Another great risk of firefighters is the exposure to asbestos and mesothelioma. Many of these burning buildings contain this dangerous fiber within their insulation and piping setups. This exposure to asbestos has been known to cause permanent damage to the lining of the organs within the chest and abdomen area. With the mesothelioma survival rate being extremely severe, this is one of the most dangerous health risks a firefighter can be exposed to.
When the firefighters take their gear off, cancer causing chemicals can become absorbed through the skin. Researchers are looking into ways to prevent from these secondary exposures to cancer causing toxins and chemicals. Some have suggested that mandatory showers be taken back at the firehouse upon return, while some others have targeted the study of these toxins to figure out how they damage the body and cause cancer.
Much of this research has been a result of the continued health risks of those who risked their lives on 9/11 nearly a decade ago. Reports have surfaced finding that nearly 70 percent of rescue workers have suffered from lung related health issues in the ten years afterwards.
In the end, it’s clear that firefighters risk their health not only in the ways that we commonly think of like running into burning buildings, but also in subtle ways that are often equally as dangerous. It may not seem as heroic for a firefighter to be sure to carefully follow safety protocol and wear the proper equipment at all times, but in truth it is the best line of defense against environmental toxins that are often as deadly as raging infernos. Hopefully as we approach an age of better understanding
of the cancer risks involved with firefighting, we can also take a safer approach on how to make sure firefighters remain cancer-free.

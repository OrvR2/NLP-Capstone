Breaking News: Kardashians MockedBy Mike KrumboltzYahoo! Buzz LogPostsBy Mike Krumboltz | Yahoo TV – 17 hours ago

Kim and Kourtney Kardashian (Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)(Yahoo! Buzz) — News anchors are supposed to read the news, not make it. But we're more than happy to make an exception for two reporters from Philadelphia's Fox 29 morning show, "Good Day."
After interviewing Kim and Kourtney Kardashian on the air, Mike Jerrick and Sheinelle Jones thought the cameras had stopped rolling. They hadn't.
As soon as they said their goodbyes to the Kardashians, who were promoting a line of clothes, the anchors began making fun of the two sisters. "Can they still hear us?" asks Jerrick. He then proceeds to mock the reality stars for their high-pitched voices and affinity for shoulder pads.
Jones half-heartedly attempts to defend the sisters, saying, "I think they're stunning." But even she can't keep a straight face as her cohort continues speaking in a nasally Kardashian-like voice, a bit like a Smurf who had inhaled helium.
Yes, yes, we know. Making fun of others is wrong. Except when it's the Kardashians. Then it's hilarious. Enjoy!

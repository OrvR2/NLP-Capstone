In Peru, climate change is already a troubling daily reality. Peru’s arid coast depends largely on glacial run-off for its water supply, especially during the long dry season. In the past 30 years, the country has lost 22 percent of its glacier area, according to a recent study by the World Bank. Unless new ways to manage and store water can be found, Peruvians will face severe problems in the coming decades.

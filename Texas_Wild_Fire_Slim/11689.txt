KNOW TAX IMPLICATIONS









[ Print | 

 ]



As with any event that creates income (like a timber sale) it is always a good idea to know what implications the income will have on your tax for that year.  Timber sales will substantially increase your taxable income in the year that the sale takes place.  A look at how the potential income is going to affect your tax payment is critical in the management of a timber sale. 
Contact a CPA or their tax accountant before making a sale for suggestions as to handling tax planning for the additional income.

From The Daily Green:
Whether you're looking for organic dog toys, recycled beds or other natural pet products, you'll find great ideas here.
Throw the earth a bone and reduce your dog's carbon paw print with these organic and natural dog products. Doug Mazeffa, research director at Greenopia.com, rates products based on safety and sustainability. When shopping for pets, Mazeffa recommends buying items made out of post-consumer recycled materials that don't have as large of an impact as items that rely on virgin material production.

				Our staff is mainly research types, their efforts are utilized to determine the validity of various nutrients ability to improve the health of our beloved dogs.  The blending of popular human causes with the pet market is a fairly successful method of expanding the amount of money people are willing to spend on their dogs and cats.  Our staff has a front row seat when a new trend is marketed to family pet, we see the studies attempting to fabricate demand among pet owners for products their not seeking.  The greening of pet products is to early we are still attempting to determine how to supplement their diets to prevent heart disease and whether their health insurance covers bypass surgery.

				As a responsibl­e dog companion, I look for safe alternativ­es as well as recyclable materials when possible.  I pay extra for doggie bags, for instance, that breakdown when I could buy the cheaper plastic bags.  I am very careful of the food and treats my dog ingests and the toys he comes into contact with.  He's a dog.  He's going to put his nose in places that I can't always control.  What I can control is what comes from my hands.  

All of my friends with dogs are the same way.  Now, granted, we have a bit of discretion­ary income but we aren't the only ones.

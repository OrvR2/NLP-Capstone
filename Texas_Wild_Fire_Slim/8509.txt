Cooper content to be public enemy No. 1 for KiwisBy ROB MURRAY - AP Sports Writer | AP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — Quade Cooper has a message for the New Zealand public at the Rugby World Cup following his latest clash with All Blacks captain Richie McCaw — "I don't mind being public enemy No. 1."The New Zealand-born Australia flyhalf was accused by All Blacks coach Graham Henry of deliberately kneeing McCaw in the head as the Wallabies won the Tri-Nations decider 25-20 in Brisbane on Aug. 27.The pair also engaged in another bit of Bledisloe brouhaha beforehand as the Wallabies threatened the try line, Cooper trying to drag McCaw away from a maul only to be manhandled himself by All Blacks scrumhalf Piri Weepu.Cooper escaped suspension by SANZAR for the kneeing incident, but it wasn't the first match in which he has been involved in an incident with the openside flanker.During Australia's victory in Hong Kong last October to end the All Blacks' 10-match winning streak in head-to-heads, Cooper shoved McCaw after James O'Connor had scored the decisive try.But the 23-year-old Cooper says he couldn't care less about how he is perceived in the country of his birth. He left New Zealand eight years ago before forging a professional career in Queensland."I don't mind being public enemy No. 1. It's going to come with the territory," he said. "I actually enjoy it. I get a buzz all the time. Reading my Twitter there is a lot of guys who have their own opinions, some not necessarily nice. I like reading through them and getting back to most of them."Most New Zealanders hate the Wallabies, but there is a lot out there that respect that we play as well. We've a lot of respect for the All Black public and the All Black jersey as well for what they've done and the history they have. At the same time, we're here to win a competition — we're not here to make friends."Asked if there is bad blood with McCaw, Cooper pleaded ignorance."I don't know, you'll have to ask him," Cooper said. "From my point of view, there's not. It's just a matter of he's wearing a different jersey. From a personal point of view, I don't know the bloke. I haven't had much to do with him off the field."McCaw, for his part, seems similarly perplexed by a "feud" that neither player acknowledges but which nevertheless appears real. Speaking two days after the last Tri-Nations match, he could offer little light on their history."I have absolutely no idea. I have absolutely nothing against the guy at all," McCaw said. "I never get personal on the field because if you start doing that you will make decisions that aren't best for the team. There have been a couple of times when we have had a bit of push and shove but, whether he's into that, I don't know. Certainly for me, it doesn't worry me at all."

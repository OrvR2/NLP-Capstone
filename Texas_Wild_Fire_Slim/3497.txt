SLAVE LAKE — The wait is over — at least for now.Residents of Slave Lake will finally get some answers now that officials in the town have a firm grasp on the amount of properties that were destroyed and damaged by a firestorm that carved a path of destruction through the community of 7,000 people Sunday evening.Len MacCharles, incident commander and deputy fire chief of operations for the Calgary Fire Department, said a total of 374 lots were destroyed and a further 52 lots were damaged by the wildfires, which hit the area with 100 km/h winds.The most extensive damage to homes and communities is in the southeast and a section of downtown. The town hall has been reduced to a pile of charred rubble, while nearby businesses were also burned by the blaze.In the municipal district of Lesser Slave River, 59 lots were destroyed and 32 damaged. More than a handful of firefighters also lost their homes.MacCharles said the winds created a firestorm that caused devastation that's second to none."In all the years I've been doing this job, I haven't seen anything with this kind of speed and devastation," said MacCharles, who's noticed the strong sense of community."It gives me a lot of hope for how this community will be able to rebuild."Upon entering the town, it appears to be untouched by the flames that sent residents fleeing their homes with whatever possessions they could grab.The Tim Hortons, McDonald's and shopping district that sits along the main highway through town remain untouched. A few streets away however, it's a much different story as entire neighbourhoods are now reduced to piles of charred rubble, resembling more of a war zone than a tranquil community.Fire officials have spent the last three days putting out the remaining flames, and have now extinguished 90% of the hotspots.After being virtually a ghost town since the fire, Slave Lake was alive and thriving again Thursday as hundreds of people from the town and MD are now taking care of recovery efforts, which includes restoring power and water, which so far MacCharles said has been a success.One of the most time-consuming tasks is shutting off all the natural gas valves at every location throughout the town, he added."There's a lot of people working on a lot of fronts," said MacCharles. "Everybody out there you see is working to get residents back in a safe manner."Many of the town's residents are left wondering when they'll be able to come home.MacCharles said there has been a lot of thought around letting residents back into the town to take a look at the damage, but officials have determined it's just not safe enough to do so.The town's Mayor, Karina Pillay-Kinee recently visited evacuees at reception centres in Athabasca, Westlock and Edmonton, calling it "an emotional day."But after seeing the spirit of the town's citizens during such times of crisis, she's confident the recovery will occur sooner than later."When you first see the devastation, it's a numbing feeling," said Pillay-Kinee, who called the lengthy task of rebuilding "overwhelming."She said it could take weeks before residents can return to the community, which is why the province and town are currently working on providing more comfortable accommodations for evacuees."It's (rebuilding) a daunting task. It's going to take some time to get our community back."Both of the two fires that ripped through the town have since been pushed into the nearby lake by southeast winds, but are still considered out of control.With higher winds again in the forecast for this weekend, the town is not out of the clear yet since conditions can still change in the blink of an eye."Until the fires are completely contained, they will still be a threat," said Jeff Driscoll, wildfire information officer with Sustainable Resource Development. "It's just not safe yet for people to come home."Combined, the fires have burned 105,000 hectares. donate: Canadian Red Cross (donations): 1-800-418-1111To DONATE TO REDCROSS for the wildfires just TEXT the #30333 and type in "REDCROSS", it will automatically donate $5 from your phone and be put on your bill, let's see how far we can go to reach out to our Canadian people in great need

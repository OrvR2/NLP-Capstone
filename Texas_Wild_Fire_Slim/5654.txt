Tea party, right blast Teamster president Hoffa’s remarks; Bachmann fundraisesBy Rachel Rose HartmanPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Rachel Rose Hartman | The Ticket – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

Hoffa (Paul Sancya/AP)Tea party leaders and conservative critics are calling on the White House to denounce remarks made yesterday by International Brotherhood of Teamsters president James Hoffa. Hoffa's detractors contend that his comments called for violence against tea party members
During Hoffa's introduction Monday of President Obama at a Detroit, Mich., Labor Day rally, Hoffa likened union fights to a "war" and a "battle" between union workers and tea partiers, and described union supporters as Obama's "army."
"Everybody here has got a vote," Hoffa said. "If we go back and we   keep the eye on the prize. Let's take these son-of-a-bitches out and give   America back to America where we belong."
As evidence of how quickly outrage over Hoffa's comments had spread, presidential candidate Michele Bachmann began using them in a fundraising pitch just hours after Hoffa's speech had concluded.
You can watch clips of Hoffa's remarks below via ABC News:


Bachmann on Monday at 4 p.m. EST emailed supporters, hoping to benefit from anger over Hoffa.
"Hoffa  and his well-funded liberal allies are scared of our momentum, and will do  anything to try and silence our voices. But, we won't go quietly into  the night," she wrote. "Will you follow this link and make a donation to help me defend myself against their profane and vicious attacks?"
While Bachmann fundraised off the furor, tea party leaders, conservatives and others demanded that Obama and the Democratic Party denounce Hoffa's remarks. Some conservatives suggested that Hoffa's call to "take out" tea partiers encouraged violent behavior.
"Jimmy Hoffa's remarks are inexcusable and amount to a  call for violence on peaceful tea party members, which include many  Teamster members," Tea Party Express chairman Amy Kremer said in a statement calling for Hoffa to apologize and for the White House to denounce his comments.
"Lying attacks on the tea party movement have  disturbingly increased in recent days. It is high time that elected  leaders like President Obama were held accountable when their key  supporters engage in harmful and divisive rhetoric."
Kremer made reference to Democratic Reps. André Carson and Maxine Waters, who each made inflammatory statements about the tea party in recent weeks: Carson suggested tea party members of Congress support lynching; Waters told the tea party to "go straight to hell."
Meanwhile, national and local tea party groups have called on Democrats to denounce the comments, requested apologies, and some have called for Hoffa's resignation as news of the comments spread via conservative news sites, blogs, among pundits, on Twitter and cable news shows over the past day.
Several critics have compared Hoffa's comments to the type of violent rhetoric President Obama called on both parties to denounce in the wake of the deadly shooting attack at Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' Tucson, Ariz. town hall event in January.
But progressive site MediaMatters and others argue that much of the outrage over Hoffa's comments this week has been unfairly based on excerpts of Hoffa's remark which did not include Hoffa's statement about using the ballot box to "take out" tea partiers. MediaMatters claims the edited version of Hoffa's remarks, promoted by Fox News, were misleading and more incendiary.
Hoffa on Tuesday defended his comments in an interview with Talking Points Memo, saying he has no regrets about his choice of words.
"How is that different than Mitch McConnell saying he wants to take out Barack Obama?" Hoffa asked.
Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz refused to denounce the comments during an interview on Fox News Tuesday, accusing the network of failing to express outrage over incendiary remarks made at tea party rallies.
Obama made no direct reference to Hoffa's speech during his own remarks Monday and the White House had not issued comment on the speech as of early Tuesday afternoon.

The only rights the Union worker has it to strike and then watch his job move overseas when the company can no longer afford their demands for higher wages and benefits.

The unions keep harping  about protecting workers rights. Don't non union workers (tea party workers) have rights ? The way Hoffa talks you are not considered to be real workers unless you are unionized !

Unions are all about themselves and everyone elses money. They claim to be for the common man or woman but are really a socialist organization that want more union workers so they can pay more in union fees and Union leader and their political supporters can get a bigger payout.

I find it so funny how these liberal are so afraid of us everyday folks when we stand up to them. Tea Party organizations don't demand dues and they don't discriminate against anyone. We just shine a light on the ridiculous and absorb and counter with some common sense ideas.

Unions are essentially a communist concept and many union leaders are out and out communists. Communists are also very violent in their beliefs. However if they get in charge you suddenly find that they do not really believe in communism as espoused by the likes of Marx, they actually believe in something more like national socialism (Nazi's) that they will get everything, and people get nothing (as normal). Nazi;s and communists hate each other because they are almost identical.
Hoffa is a communist bully, and will probably end up like his father....

it is typical of the republicans and tea party to blast organized labor because they want the robber barons to come back so the working class will be under their scummy thumbs with nothing to look forward to except a lousy pay check with no medical, dental, life insurance and retirement benefits

and we all will be screwed out of social security and medicare too

them idiots want to put the labor movement in the ground and push us back to before unions existed when people were at the mercy of the boss of the company where they work

yep, the republican/tea party dream is a real nightmare when you open your eyes

I guess it's ok for Sarah Palin to talk about lock and load or putting people in her sights but when it's someone who supports the average working person,  that's not ok. Get a grip vote the bims out who are against the average working person. The rich haven't done me any good and I doubt that they ever will!

After all the invective, hateful speeches, and violent messages from both the Republicans, and comments from the Koch brothers that the upcoming election would be the "Mother of all Wars" with regard to removing Obama, I have to laugh at any of them who find fault with what Hoffa said.

We are finally up and out there.  The conservatives have always sat back and took the crap and lies from the liberals, NO MORE. even if you are not a Tea Party member, most everyone agrees with them!  The Unions are old school.  I remember during the illegal immigration debate they had 800 numbers set up for union members to call there congressman.  That is no joke.

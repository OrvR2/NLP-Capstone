Investigators in Dr. Dean Tang's laboratory study how cancer stem cells effect tumor progression, metastasis and progression.

Dr. Ellen Richie studies the molecular mechanisms of thymic development. Shown here are mouse whisker cells visualized by an early epithelial cell marker.

Researchers in Dr. Mark Bedford's laboratory investigate how protein-protein interactions modulate transcriptional control and DNA damage repair.

Dr. Richard Wood directs research investigating how DNA repair enzymes prevent cancer following exposure to carcinogens.


















The Virginia Harris Cockrell Cancer Research Center at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Science Park, Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis is a basic science
research component. Science Park is located in the Lost Pines region near Smithville, Texas. Our mission
is to investigate the molecular biology of cancer and to
develop means for cancer prevention and detection.





The Center for Research on Environmental
	   Disease, based at
	
	Science Park and funded by the
	NIEHS, was established to study the mechanisms by which
	environmental factors cause human disease and to develop
	methods for the detection, prevention and control of
	environmentally-related disease. In addition, the Center
	seeks to detect human exposure and monitor disease
	prevention strategies.

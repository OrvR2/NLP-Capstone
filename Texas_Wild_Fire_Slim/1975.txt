What I Learned About the Middle East and Its People After 9/11By Amy HetlandPostsWebsiteBy Amy Hetland | Yahoo! Contributor Network – 11 hrs ago






Yahoo! is asking Americans how September 11 changed them. Below is an account from a reader.


  I was thousands of miles away in a Parisian hotel when 9/11 happened, so all I knew was that two planes flew into the World Trade Center. There were no English-language television stations, and no English-language newspapers left on the neighborhood stands. It wasn't until the next day could I find a newspaper to answer the many questions I had, but yet leave me with even more questions.


  [Your story: How has September 11 changed you?]


  When I came back to the states a week after, everyone else seemed to be able to move on with their lives. After all, it happened on the East Coast, not in the heart of the Midwest where I lived. On the other hand, I crashed into despair. Even now I can't explain why; I think I just couldn't believe that someone would hate my home and my people so much as to kill us. For a while, I would have a sense of fear when I saw a plane fly low over the skyscrapers of Minneapolis, where I worked, or when I would see a Middle Eastern man on the street. I never paid much attention to the Middle East before. I didn't even know where Afghanistan was. This all changed after 9/11.


  At first I wanted to "kill the terrorists," and I cheered when we finally went into Afghanistan. I began to learn more about this country, reading Khaled Hosseini's books. I gasped at the horrors that the Afghans endured at the hands of the Taliban. I knew we were right in going in and ridding this once beautiful and mysterious home of its terrorists.


  Then we went into Iraq. I knew about Saddam Hussein after his invasion of Kuwait, and after the reports of weapons, I thought another attack was imminent if we didn't rid the world of this warmonger. Then other countries of the Middle East began to introduce themselves to me. I saw "Persepolis" on a plane, and proceeded to read Marjane Satrapi's book. I became aware of the protests in Iran, and continue to follow them to this day. I cheered the Arab Spring uprisings this year, hoping against all hope that finally, peace would come to the Middle East.


  Four years ago, I started volunteering teaching English as Second Language in my community. Some of my students are from the Middle East. I think about them, wondering how they came here, what obstacles they had to overcome to get a better life for their children. I can't imagine coming to a country like ours, having to learn our complicated language, essentially having to start over in one's life. I admire my students; they have such courage, and serve as a witness at how much people want a better life for their families.


  All these changes have brought me a global awareness that I never had before. I don't see the Middle East as an enemy stronghold, but a region full of people like you and me, hoping their future will be one of freedom and democracy.

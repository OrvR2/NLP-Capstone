All Blacks ready for bone-cruncher with TongaBy FOSTER NIUMATA - AP Sports Writer | AP – 8 hrs ago

AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — When the All Blacks were last sighted at the World Cup, eyes were glazed and faces expressed shock as they tried to comprehend their earliest exit in tournament history.Richie McCaw and Dan Carter, both replaced during that 2007 quarterfinal, were forced to watch from the stands in Millennium Stadium as France rallied to upset a crumbling New Zealand side.Four years later, McCaw, Carter and Co and the same coaches reappear under lights on Friday in their revamped Eden Park fortress to begin a new quest to banish those haunting memories when they open the seventh World Cup against a fearless Tonga.Armed again as the title favorites, the All Blacks are said to be a lot more excited about the buildup than four years ago because they're on home turf. But coach Graham Henry noted the players have become quieter, bantered a little less and focused a bit more.As his assistant Steve Hansen put it, having not won the World Cup in 24 years, "there's just a sense of needing to get the job done."Tonga should be accounted for, although it's not expected to be as easy as that reads.New Zealand hasn't scored less than 45 points against the Pacific islanders in their three previous matches, two of which were at World Cups in 1999 and 2003.But knowing Tonga has become far more professional and a lot harder to beat in recent seasons, the All Blacks have chosen a side to meet the improved physical threat head on. The All Blacks will send out virtually their best pack, confident in winning the set-pieces, while the backline has been bulked with muscle and speed in the form of Sonny Bill Williams and Israel Dagg instead of the experience of nearly 150 caps shared by Conrad Smith and Mils Muliaina.Utilities Richard Kahui and Isaia Toeava were also preferred out wide ahead of specialist wings Cory Jane and Zac Guildford.Henry said competition within the All Blacks squad for fullback, the wings and scrumhalf was still to be resolved.Williams, the backup midfielder who's loyalty has been questioned while he hassles over his contract, was offered unexpected game-time.And Henry gave him a message: "Don't try and do it all in five minutes, the game lasts for 80.""I think when players get a chance and haven't played for a while, they try and push it too much and overdo it and I guess patience is going to be key. If he just lets his natural ability control the way he plays then I think he will do well."Center partner Ma'a Nonu was hoping to benefit from the freakish offloads Williams mastered while playing years of rugby league."If he can do his magic," Nonu said, "hopefully I can run off him."Tonga captain Finau Maka boldly declared his squad didn't care who New Zealand put up against them. A majority of the players in the squad have lived and played in New Zealand, including Maka. His brother and coach, Isitolo Maka, was a 1998 All Black."It's home away from home for us, just another boost for us really," Finau Maka said.The Tongans have also been boosted by the frenzied and fun support of their fans, who have literally stalled Auckland wherever the team has gone. There are more than 55,000 people of Tongan descent in New Zealand, more than half than actually live in the islands themselves, and it's been easy to believe this week that they all live in Auckland.The Tongans will send out a front row heavier than New Zealand's and the fastest player on the field in ACT winger Viliame Iongi, who since his debut in June has scored seven tries in six tests.Their confidence has been proudly expressed by Maka all week."Tonga beat Fiji in its last match and New Zealand lost to Australia," he teased. "We've got our tails up and theirs is down."Maka hasn't been so quick to endorse a simultaneous challenge with the All Blacks' pre-match haka, despite overwhelming calls from their supporters to take on the haka. On Friday, the Tongans will do their sipi tau first, and it'll be up to the All Blacks when they respond. When the teams last met in the 2003 World Cup in Brisbane, Tonga's decision to do the sipi tau during the haka thrilled the crowd.Then the All Blacks won 91-7.___Lineups:New Zealand: Israel Dagg, Richard Kahui, Ma'a Nonu, Sonny Bill Williams, Isaia Toeava, Daniel Carter, Jimmy Cowan; Victor Vito, Richie McCaw (captain), Jerome Kaino, Ali Williams, Brad Thorn, Owen Franks, Andrew Hore, Tony Woodcock.

With summer's warm, activity-friendly days coming to a
close and fall's homey coziness upon us, most of us experience
a lull in our exercise regimens and a leap in our scale numbers
around this time of year.  But, if you're careful, staying
fit and healthy during the colder months doesn't have to be a
challenge. In this video, Dr. Oz outlines the most common
weight loss mistakes and offers advice on keeping your health up
and your weight down through a sluggish autumn—and beyond.

'Doctor' Oz is not a doctor and knows virtually nothing of actual medicine or health. (if he does he certainly never discusses it) Please do not get any type of medical advice from him. Real doctors don't get TV shows - that alone should tell you something.

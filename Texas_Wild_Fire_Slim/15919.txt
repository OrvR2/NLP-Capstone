Kate Gosselin’s flashy new carBy Lizbeth Scordo | Celebrity Broods – Thu, 8 Sep, 2011 5:19 PM EDT

Kate Gosselin recently purchased herself an Audi TT sports car. Think it's an odd choice for a single mom of eight? …
For most new parents, trading in the car they had pre-kids for something more reliable, spacious, practical, and less, well, cool, usually comes with the territory just like diaper changes and sleep deprivation. A zippy little sports car usually isn't an option again until junior is off to college and said parents become empty nesters.
Except, that is, if you're mom of eight Kate Gosselin.

The 36-year-old reality star (make that former reality star) recently went out and bought herself a brand new Audi TT. It's got leather seats, a turbo-charged engine, and can go up to 130 miles per hour. What it can't do is hold even a fraction of Kate's big brood in its miniscule back seat. Kind of an unusual choice for a single mom of 7-year-old sextuplets and 10-year-old twins, no?
Kate's reality show, "Kate Plus 8" was recently canceled, and she's expressed concerns about finances. …
You might be thinking, "Hey, if she's got the money, let her get whatever extra car she wants." Thing is, Kate's reality show "Kate Plus 8" (the spinoff of the TLC monster hit "Jon and Kate Plus 8" that began airing after she and Jon Gosselin divorced in 2009) was recently canceled. Since then, she's lamented to the media about financial woes.

"People think we made gazillions of dollars, and we didn't," she said in a recent cover interview with People. "After the show was canceled, I said, 'I'll go back to my old nursing job.' If nothing comes up I'll do it. But the scary reality is, 12-hour nursing shifts every day wouldn't let me continue to provide well for eight kids essentially on my own. When you think about it that way, it gets really scary."
Scary enough to go out and buy a small-but-gorgeous ride that averages in the $50,000 range? Our sympathy's waning, Kate ...

she never reallly did take care of those kids all by herself..she always had a brew of babysitters helping her out..and deep in my heart i pity those kids..they never really knew waht it really is to have fun like other kids...she bossed her x around till he couldnt take it anmymore...he dumped her and never gave up on his kids..its her he ran away from...she's a cold hearted bitch who used her kids to get a show...i never could stand her and now i really hope her kids will have a normal childhood..

I do not understand the attention these reality show people get. She has let it all go to her head and I am glad to see that the show was cancelled.  The important thing is the quality of life the kids have and not what she does.

Ah, Kate Gosselin, a prime example of our misplaced priorities with fame and celebrity these days. A woman gets knocked up a bunch of times? Give her a TV show, let's exploit those kids for every penny! A woman is a talented singer and songwriter? Well if she's *really* good, she'll get a lot of subscribers on YouTube and maybe a couple will donate her money through Paypal.

Is this what YAHOO calls journalism? Is this what society calls a celebrity?  Answer, No!

It is the American Dream, and she is living it. Those who watched this silly show 
(fools), should not be envious of her, and should be happy for her getting this car.

Regardless of what car Kate drives, what kind of house she lives in with her brood or even what she does in her life, NO ONE SHOULD CARE.  Everytime she hits the news, the cash register goes chinching.  She has a lot of personal problems brought on by her and how she deals with them is another rung around her neck.  Boo Hoo!

It's probably Audi's way of advertizing.  They know it will get plenty of press if the much disliked Kate drives it. Probably did not cost her a dime.

What a bunch of garbage all of you wrote. Seems like you have nothing better to do than to trash talk people. Give Kate a break...and for the person who wrote that  her claim to fame was intercourse.For your misinformation...she had invitro fertilization for her sextuplets....dah.

Honestly, who cares?? I'm sure she will manage to provide for her children (as will their father)! She birthed 8 kids, for goodness sake! Let her drive WHATEVER she wants! Who are we to judge?

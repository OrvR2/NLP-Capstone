TEXAS COMMUNITY WILDFIRE PROTECTION PLAN









[ Print | 

 ]



Planning for wildfires must take place long before a community is threatened. Once a wildfire starts, the only option available to firefighters is to attempt to suppress the fire before it reaches a community.  Texas Forest Service has developed a user-friendly set of guides and tools – the Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) – to aid communities that wish to reduce the risk wildfires pose to the homes, businesses and natural resources. A CWPP is unique in that it empowers communities to share the responsibility of determining the best strategies for protecting a community and allows communities to make informed choices to decrease the hazards around them. To assist counties and communities in the development of these plans, the WUI team has developed the CWPP Guide, Handbook and Leaders Guide.The CWPP Web ApplicationThe Texas Forest Service CWPP Web application was created in an effort to provide communities with a tool that streamlines the development of a Community Wildfire Protection Plan. This site provides access to numerous resources that will ensure that the plan reflects the communities’ wildfire protection needs, as well as meeting the requirements of the Healthy Forest Restoration Act. CWPP StatusTo date, there are 94 completed CWPP's in the state of Texas.

Terms and Conditions
Each item in your order is sold by Amazon Export Sales, Inc. ("Amazon Export")
or the merchant that the item is specified as sold by ("Merchant"). Those items for shipment to countries outside
of the U.S.
may be subject to taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination
country ("Import Fees"). The recipient of the shipment is the
importer of record in the destination country and is responsible for all Import
Fees. 


With respect to each item for which Import Fees
have been calculated, you authorize Amazon Export or Merchant (as applicable) to
designate a carrier ("Designated Carrier") to act as your agent with the
relevant customs and tax authorities in the destination country, to clear your
merchandise, process and remit your actual Import Fees for such item.
"Import Fees Deposit" represents an
estimate of the Import Fees that will be levied on the items in your order for
shipment to countries outside of the US. By placing your order, you
agree to allow Amazon Export and/or Merchant (as applicable) to collect the Import
Fees Deposit for the applicable items in your order. This deposit will be used,
on your behalf, to reimburse the Designated Carriers for the import fees that
they have paid on your behalf to the appropriate authorities of the destination
country.
You further agree that the Designated Carriers
may disclose to Amazon Export or Merchant (as applicable) the amount of actual
Import Fees levied on the item you have purchased from Amazon Export and/or
Merchant ("Actual Import Fees"). In the event that the Import Fees
Deposit exceeds the Actual Import Fees, Amazon Export or Merchant (as
applicable) will refund the difference to you.
In the case of gifts or other purchases made on behalf of another recipient, you also agree to grant the foregoing authorizations on behalf of the recipient designated in your order.
To obtain details regarding the Actual Import Fees, or to obtain documentation or receipts in connection with customs clearance, you may contact the Carrier specified in your shipment confirmation e-mail. 
These terms and conditions are in addition to the standard Conditions
of Use of the Amazon website. Pursuant to those terms, title and risk of
loss for the items transfer to the recipient upon delivery to the common
carrier in the United States.
Please note that Merchants participating in the
International Direct program may have policies that differ from Amazon Export's
terms and conditions. For items you have
purchased from a Merchant, please see the applicable Merchant's policies for
any other terms and conditions that may apply to your purchase of such items.
Limitations
For products shipped internationally, please note that any manufacturer warranty may not be valid; manufacturer service options may not be available; product manuals, instructions and safety warnings may not be in destination country languages; the products (and accompanying materials) may not be designed in accordance with destination country standards, specifications, and labeling requirements; and the products may not conform to destination country voltage and other electrical standards (requiring use of an adapter or converter if appropriate). You are responsible for assuring that the product can be lawfully imported to the destination country. When ordering from Amazon.com, the recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country.Read our Import Fees Terms and Conditions.

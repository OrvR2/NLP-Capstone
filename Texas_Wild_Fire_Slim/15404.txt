Brush fires have ravaged the state just recently. But the Bastrop County Complex Fire is so large, unpredictable, and fast that authorities have included the word “complex” into its official name. It has already destroyed an estimated 25,000 acres and more than 1,000 homes as of the time of writing. However, the above statistics could no longer be true as the fire reportedly consumes about one house every four minutes.Governor Rick Perry Rallies Aid To Fight FireTexas Governor Rick Perry had to leave the Republican presidential campaign to get back home and try to generate aid and manpower to deal with the fire. People are calling the Bastrop County Complex Fire the most destructive brush fire ever recorded in Texas. One of the most intriguing questions about the fire is that no one has any idea how it started. Texas is experiencing the worst drought this year which makes it easier for sparks to start another brush fire.Fire Crossed Colorado RiverSimilar smaller fires have emerged and are spreading across the county. The fire is spread by strong winds and fed by dry shrubs, grass, and trees. The Bastrop County Complex Fire is reportedly moving southward and getting bigger. The fire allegedly crossed the Colorado River in two locations. This could mean the fire is so large that its tentacles can cross over huge bodies of water like the Colorado River.Fire Still UncontainedAs of press time, the fire is still uncontained. This means Texas needs to deploy more crews to fight the blaze. Moreover, fire authorities are confused on how to fight such a big blaze.  Officials say they don’t know where it began. They don’t know where the fire’s eye is. The officials also don’t know where it finishes. “We will be working days on end. The fire is so dynamic we really have no idea where it is,” an official was quoted as saying.In this article, you learned that the huge brush fire swallows Bastrop County, Texas.

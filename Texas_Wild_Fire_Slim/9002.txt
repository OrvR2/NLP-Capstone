'Barbie Girl' Tops Rolling Stone's Worst Songs of the '90s

Posted Tue Sep 6, 2011 3:57pm PDT by Andy Greene in The Rolling Stone Blog



When people look back on a decade's music they tend to focus on the good stuff - but the people who lived through the time period know better. While the 1990s certainly had amazing music, not everything on the radio was Nirvana or Radiohead. Michael Bolton, Kenny G. and Vanilla Ice sold enough records to fill 500 landfills - which is where most of those records now reside. Last week, Rolling Stone asked readers to vote for the worst song of the 1990s. And topping the list is Aqua's "Barbie Girl.""Barbie Girl" - written by the Danish dance-pop group Aqua - is an incredibly polarizing song. Many people were offended by the portrayal of a woman as a man's plastic doll, begging him to "undress me everywhere." Others loved the over-the-top cartoonish video and bizarre sound of the song. Mattel (the makers of Barbie) were less than pleased that their product was being presented in such an overtly sexual way and filed a lawsuit. The courts ruled that the song was a parody and thus permissible, but Mattel took it all the way to the Supreme Court. The company had a change of heart in 2009, when they changed the lyrics and used the song in an ad campaign. ROLLING STONE'S WORST '90s SONG ENTRIES, 2-10:2. Los Del Rio, "Macarena"3. Billy Ray Cyrus, "Achy Breaky Heart" 4. Vanilla Ice, "Ice Ice Baby"5. Chumbawamba, "Tubthumping"6. Hanson, "MMMBop"7. Celine Dion, "My Heart Will Go On"8. Baha Men, "Who Let The Dogs Out?"9.

And where are all the boy bands like N' Sync and Backstreet Boys?   They were the worst of the worst.

Not the greatest of Aqua's library of music, but still pretty @#$% good. I'm anxiously waiting for their new album to drop (next month I hope. It's already been pushed back twice.)

113 users disliked this commentA Yahoo! User Tue Sep 06, 2011 05:59 pm PDT Report Abuse Some are clearly bad, but many are great songs that bring back college fun and starting out with a real job.   Can agree that Barbie Girl is not good, and "I'm too sexy" is bad.   4 Non Blondes is annoying, but the other songs listed all had some positive attributes about them

188 users disliked this commentUser Darrell Tue Sep 06, 2011 06:02 pm PDT Report Abuse "Ice Ice Baby" was the first hip hop song to top the Billboard charts. The song was great and the hook was infectious.   This makes one question the credibility of this poll and its respondents.

37 users disliked this commentUser Plantman Tue Sep 06, 2011 06:02 pm PDT Report Abuse I have so many problems with this list.   I'm not saying the tunes are genius, but you really need to have more respect.   This list should be called, "Tunes A Ton Of People Loved In The '90's".   You can't deny all of these were huge hits.   It might be embarassing now, but please.   It's like saying your haircut was ridiculous in the '90s, just because style changed.

You could name a gazillion songs "better" than these from the '90's, that no one's ever heard, because they're not catchy enough.

Again, I won't say I love all of these, but they deserve some level of respect for the success they achieved, no matter your taste.

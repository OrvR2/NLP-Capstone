Blog Posts by Laura RozenEx-Saudi spy chief: after UBL killing, U.S. should have declared victoryBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – 10 hrs agoAfghan Pres. Hamid Karzai and Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal at Davos in 2006. (Michel  …Former Saudi spy chief Prince Turki al-Faisal, speaking at Washington think tank Wednesday, said after the killing of Osama bin Laden in May, the United States should have declared victory in Afghanistan and gone home.
"Killing bin Laden would have been the perfect moment for your   president to say, 'We've done it, we are victorious, this is the   timetable that we've set for withdrawal of troops and goodbye and good   luck,' " Turki said Wednesday, at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Washington Post's Craig Whitlock reported. "This would be the perfect moment to leave with a   victory and not to go on and sort of continue in this endless mission   of strike and counterstrike."
"I don't mean withdrawing your embassy, your economic aid or your   other support, but having troops on the ground in Afghanistan has never   succeeded," he added.Read More »Live chat with “Top Secret America” reporter Dana PriestBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – 14 hrs agoPulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post intelligence reporter Dana Priest and producer Michael Kirk of Frontline's "Top Secret America" are taking questions for a live web chat at 1 to 2pm today on the rise of America's  national security state.

(Saudi Press …Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has sent a private message to President Obama, The Envoy has learned.
The message was delivered to the White House by the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Adel A. Al-Jubeir, who returned to Washington from a trip to the oil-rich kingdom last week, a former senior US official told The Envoy on condition of anonymity.
The exact subject of the correspondence remained opaque, but it was described as concerning a Saudi diplomatic initiative--possibly on Syria. The message was also described as substantive and "close-hold," meaning not  widely briefed beyond a small circle of senior officials.
The Saudi ambassador has since left Washington again, a second former senior US official who works on the region told The Envoy.
The White House declined to comment Tuesday.
The director of the Saudi embassy in Washington's information office, Nail al-Jubeir, the ambassador's brother, told the Envoy by email Tuesday that he had just returned from holiday and did not immediately have any information on such a message, but would look into it.
American-Saudi bilateral relations have been recovering from a period of tension. Riyadh has been upset by the Arab Spring uprisings, and was horrified by Obama's call last February for Washington's ally of three decades, Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, to step down from power.Read More »Former SecDef Gates named chancellor of William & MaryBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Tue, Sep 6, 2011Vice President Biden swears in CIA director David Petraeus Tuesday. (David Lienemann/White …The national security shuffle kicked off by Defense Secretary Bob Gates' retirement in June now appears to have come full circle.
This morning, Vice President Joe Biden swore in now-retired Gen. David Petraeus as the new director of the CIA. And an hour later, the White House sent out President Obama's statement of congratulations to Gates on being named the incoming chancellor of William & Mary University, his alma mater.
"As he did at Texas  A&M and the Department of Defense, Bob will again help lead an  institution devoted to our nation's most precious resource—our young men  and women," Obama said in the statement, going on to wish Gates "the very best as he begins this new chapter" in his post-government career. (The previous time Gates retired from the government, as CIA director, he went on to become dean of Texas A & M; he then came back to government service to work as Defense secretary for President Bush in 2004.)

A gargantuan male sea crocodile--all 21 feet, 2,370-pounds of him--was captured by villagers and crocodile farm staff in the southern Philippines late Saturday, and is headed to an eco-tourist park.
Bunawan township mayor Cox Elorde said the impressive, one-ton animal was caught "along a creek in his township after a three-week hunt," the Associated Press reports. (You can see the AP's video report on the captured croc below).Read More »Daily Planet: Convoy of Gadhafi loyalists enters Niger; Crocker calls for strategic patience in AfghanistanBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Tue, Sep 6, 2011Tribal elders and rebel leaders negotiate surrender of Bani Walid on Sept. 6, 2011.

Europeans mull alternative resolutionBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Fri, Sep 2, 2011Pres. Obama, Israeli PM Netanyahu, left, and Palestinian Pres. Mahmoud Abbas meet at the UN Sept. 22, 2009. (Charles …
As President Barack Obama prepares to address the United Nations later this month, a painful diplomatic failure of his administration looms: last year, speaking to the same UN General Assembly opening session, Obama voiced the hope that US-led diplomatic efforts would help achieve a negotiated agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians that would lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state this fall.
"Each of us must choose the path of peace," Obama told world diplomats gathered in New York last September. "If we do, when we come back here next year, we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the United Nations — an independent, sovereign state of Palestine, living in peace with Israel."
As that deadline fast approaches, however -- Obama is set to address the UN General Assembly on September 20th, the White House said Thursday--the vision seems further away from reality than ever. Israelis and Palestinians have not even been at the negotiating table for eleven months. Meantime, the Arab spring uprisings have re-scrambled the political order of the Arab world, toppling early on a key Arab pillar of the peace process, Egypt's Hosni Mubarak.
Amid the ongoing tumult, Israelis have grown increasingly risk averse about their restive neighborhood. Meantime, the Palestinians, having lost confidence in Washington's peacemaking abilities, have vowed to go to the United Nations and seek unilateral statehood recognition this month, bypassing a negotiated agreement with Israel, against the strenuous objections of Washington and Israel.
Watching it all with growing unease are the Europeans, who have generally been relegated to a backseat role by Washington on Mideast peacemaking. But now, some diplomatic observers suggest that the Europeans may offer a way to avert a potential disaster on the issue: by introducing an alternative UN resolution that would recognize both Israel and a Palestinian state, living side by side, in peace, and calling for renewed negotiations.
Such diplomatic discussions are in their early stages and sensitive, given several factors. Among them: the Europeans have not yet arrived at a unified position on the issue among their 27-nation bloc; Palestinian plans are still in disarray; and because the Obama administration's public position--reflecting Jerusalem's--remains to adamantly reject that any sort of Palestinian statehood resolution should proceed at the United Nations at all.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy went public this week with his discomfort at European divisions on the matter, and voiced growing conviction that Washington is unable to lead Mideast peacemaking efforts on its own:Read More »EU bans import of Syrian oilBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Fri, Sep 2, 2011The European Union issued a ban on imports of Syrian oil Friday, in what many Syrian analysts believe may be the international community's most significant measure yet to protest Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's crackdown on anti-government unrest.
"In view of the gravity of the situation in Syria, the Council today further tightened the EU's sanctions against that country and imposed a ban on the import of Syrian oil to the EU," the 27-nation European Union said in a press release Friday. "The prohibition concerns purchase, import and transport of oil and other petroleum products from Syria. No financial or insurance services may be provided for such transactions."
Analysts estimate such sanctions can do real damage to the Damascus regime's economic standing, especially in view of two key facts: Syrian oil exports account for one-third of the Assad government's revenues; and four European countries account for an astonishingly high 90 percent of Syria's oil exports.
The "EU ban on import of oil from Syria will truly bite," Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said on Twitter Friday after the EU decision. "We are serious."Read More »Libya rebel commander contends was tortured, rendered by CIABy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Fri, Sep 2, 2011Libyan rebel Tripoli military commander Abdel Hakim Belhaj in Tripoli Aug. 31, 2011. (Francois Mori/AP)The top Libyan rebel military commander in Tripoli, Abdel Hakim Belhaj, dropped something of a bombshell in an interview with the New York Times yesterday: In  2004, he said, two CIA agents tortured him in Thailand and then "rendered" him to Libya. From that point on, he maintains, he was held in solitary confinement for the next six years.
"Yes, [Belhaj] said, he was detained by Malaysian officials in 2004 on arrival at the Kuala Lumpur airport, where he was subjected to extraordinary rendition on behalf of the United States, and sent to Thailand," the New York Times' Rod Norland writes. "In Bangkok, Mr. Belhaj said, he was tortured for a few days by two people he said were CIA agents, and then, worse, they repatriated him to Libya, where he was  thrown into solitary confinement for six years."
Now, Belhaj heads the Libyan rebels' military committee for restoring order in the capital of Tripoli.
A spokeswoman for the CIA told The Envoy Thursday the agency declined to comment on Belhaj's allegations.
But the allegations point to the challenge facing Western diplomatic officials in Libya: How much does the West know about the influential faction of the Libyan rebels with past Islamist jihadi ties? And how will such ties affect the effort to safeguard U.S. interests in a post-Gadhafi Libya?
The scholar Omar Ashour summed up the dilemma in an article this week informed by his interview with Belhaj last year: "Does his prominent role mean  that  jihadists are set to exploit the fall of Qadhafi's regime?"Read More »Gadhafi urges resistance in defiant audio speechBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Thu, Sep 1, 2011Moammar Gadhafi made his last public appearance in Tripoli in June. (AP)Where's Moammar Gadhafi? As the Libyan rebels took their manhunt for the former Libyan dictator to his latest suspected hideout in the desert town of Bani Walid, a defiant Gadhafi vowed resistance in an audio interview aired Thursday by Syria-based broadcaster al-Rai.
"Let there be a long fight and let Libya be engulfed in flames," Gadhafi said in the audio message, Al Jazeera reported.
"We will not give up," he vowed. "We are not women. We will continue fighting."
Gadhafi's call to arms came as Libyan opposition leaders met Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and European and Arab foreign ministers in Paris for a meeting of the international Contact Group on Libya. The Contact Group has been coordinating the international intervention in the north African nation since the imposition of a NATO-led no-fly zone in the country in March.
The UN is preparing a civilian mission to Libya to assist with preparations for elections, post-conflict humanitarian, reconstruction and state-building efforts.
Earlier Thursday, a Libyan rebel military commander in Tripoli, Abdel Majid Mlegta, told Reuters the rebels are increasingly focusing their manhunt for Gadhafi and his son Seif al-Islam on the town of Bani Walid, some 100 miles southeast of Tripoli.Read More »

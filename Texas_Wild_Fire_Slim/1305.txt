NEW YORK (AP) — Madonna has lost a bid to get rid of a neighbor's lawsuit claiming the superstar made a racket by using her New York City apartment as a rehearsal studio.A judge turned down Madonna's request to dismiss the suit. Her publicist and lawyer didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday, after the Aug. 24 decision was reported in the New York Law Journal.Karen George says Madonna's dance and exercise routines subjected neighbors to "blaring music, stomping and shaking walls" for up to three hours a day. Madonna took steps to dampen the sound in 2009, but George says they didn't work.She sued Madonna and the building's co-op board. They say the noise never topped legal levels.The judge says the dispute warrants a trial.

She can certainly afford to rent a warehouse some place and stop disturbing people who live there.  Obviously, the tenants are not fans of hers.

This is why our courts are so clogged with crap; judges who don't have enough common sense to judge and people who think they can sue anyone for anything.  This is a country of majority; when will people quit letting the whiners get their way?!?

Madonna sold out to israel and "its brand of residents."  If that is not wh0ring yourself out, then nothing is......

Madonna is part of a horrible jewish cult called kabbalah. kabbalah is nothing but a money-hungry cult.

This is funny.  She and Guy Ritchie filed a similar suit against their neighbors when she was married to him and living in England.  Nice that she's now getting a taste of her own medicine.  I guess in Madonna's world the rules don't apply to her.

Hope someone gets a mint but not Madonna. I think its a case that she believes she is a "Madonna" or other Goddesss and the little people have to tolerate her &h!t.

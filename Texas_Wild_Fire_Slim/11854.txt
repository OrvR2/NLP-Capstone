AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Gov. Rick Perry says residents whose homes were destroyed by a massive Central Texas wildfire will be eligible for state funding that will pay for hotel vouchers for temporary shelter as well as cover essential expenses.
The funding is being provided by the Texas Disaster Relief Fund and the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs.
The wildfire in Bastrop County near Austin has burned about 35,000 acres and destroyed nearly 1,400 homes.
Volunteers will be at shelters in Bastrop County on Saturday to take applications for the hotel vouchers.
The relief fund will provide up to $250,000 for the hotel vouchers while the state housing department will provide up to $350,000 for assistance cards to help residents pay for essential expenses.

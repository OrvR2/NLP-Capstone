Appeals Court Denies New Tax Trial For Wesley SnipesBy Janet Novack | Forbes – Tue, Sep 6, 2011




Related ContentAppeals Court Denies New Tax Trial For Wesley Snipes


A three-judge federal appeals court  panel today nixed  jailed action star Wesley Snipes’ bid for a new trial on the grounds of possible juror misconduct in his February 2008 tax trial. In that Florida trial, Snipes was convicted of three misdemeanor counts of willfully failing to file tax returns in 1999, 2000 and 2001, but acquitted of more serious felony tax charges.
Afterwards,  federal prosecutors argued Snipes should get the maximum three year prison term for his misdemeanor convictions, not only because of the amount of money involved--$14 million in gross unreported income in 1999, 2000 and 2001 alone--but also because of he was a “tax defier” whose partial acquittal was sending the wrong message to other would-be tax protestors.  Middle District of Florida Federal District Court Judge William Terrell Hodges sentenced Snipes to the max, and the star, now  49, reported to The Federal Correctional Institution-McKean in northwest Pennsylvania to serve his sentence on Dec. 9.
Snipes’  attorneys argued unsuccessfully to Hodges, and then to the 11th Circuit Appeals panel, that Snipes deserved a new trial because an e-mail from a former juror alleged three members of the jury had gone into the trial convinced Snipes was guilty and that the jurors had agreed on  the misdemeanor convictions only because they believed Snipes wouldn’t get jail time.  A new statement  from the tattletale juror (including his name) was even read aloud by now retired CNN talk show host Larry King during his December 7th show,  which featured an exclusive—and sympathetic—interview with Snipes.  During the show (transcript here) the star of the  Blade vampire trilogy complained about “egregious and very malicious efforts to misreport the facts of this case,’’  and insisted he had never taken tax protester positions and had simply followed the advice of professionals he trusted. (Two Snipes co-defendants who sold him the tax protest ideas were  convicted on felony charges.)

After the King interview, attorneys for Snipes immediately filed—and Hodge immediately rejected--an emergency motion asking that the start of Snipes’ jail term be delayed because the  juror’s statements to CNN  justified further inquiries  into potential jury misconduct.
In  its seven-page decision today, the appeals panel concluded Hodges had properly denied Snipes both a new trial and the right to interview jurors, because deliberations don’t have to be perfect and a defendant isn’t allowed to challenge his conviction based on juror “compromise, mistake, or even carelessness.’’ Instead, the court said, a defendant must show a clear impropriety, such as extraneous prejudicial information being brought to the jury’s attention or improper outside influence, to gain a new trial on the grounds of juror misconduct.  But the e-mail didn’t even allege such improper information or influence, the judges wrote.
In June, the Supreme Court declined to hear Snipes appeal of his conviction on still other grounds ---namely that he was tried in the wrong place and that prosecutors should have been forced to meet a higher standard of proof to keep the trial in Florida.

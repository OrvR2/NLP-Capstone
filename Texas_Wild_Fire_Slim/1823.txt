‘Ground Zero’ is a term that no longer applies, according to NYC mayorBy Jess Wisloski | The Upshot – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

Ten years after the terrorist attacks, and less than a week from the ribbon-cutting at the new World Trade Center, the New York City mayor says it's time to retire Ground Zero.
In a speech delivered this morning on Wall Street, Michael Bloomberg said the new construction and memorial on the site has made the name no longer fitting, news site DNAinfo.com reports. 
"We will never forget the devastation of the area that came to be known as   'Ground Zero' -- never," Bloomberg told the Association for a Better New York at a breakfast appearance, adding that the "the time has come for us to call those 16 acres what they are: The World Trade Center and the National September 11th Memorial and Museum." (Read more and see photos of the memorial at DNAinfo.com)
His call for the name change isn't the first: For years Downtown residents have asked officials to stop calling the two rising skyscrapers and eight-acre memorial "Ground Zero," according to the article, saying that moniker recognizes only the past destruction rather than the promise of recovery.
The largest tower at the new World Trade Center will reach  1,776 feet, becoming the tallest building in the country when completed,  while towers two, three, and four will each be successively shorter.
Despite the years of construction delays and cost overruns, Bloomberg says the half-finished office complex on the site of the former twin towers is the center of a growing and vibrant neighborhood, which boasts its highest population since the 1920s. 
Bloomberg pointed out that Lower Manhattan gained 4,000 new school seats, 19 new hotels, $260 million in new parks, and more new residents in the past decade than Atlanta, Dallas, and Philadelphia combined, DNAinfo.com reports.
"New York has come roaring back faster than anyone thought possible," Bloomberg told his audience of community leaders.
In addition to the skyscrapers, the site's eight-acre memorial consists of two sunken foundations at the exact spots where the towers used to stand. Inside the foundations are reflecting pools, and bronze protective walls atop the pools are etched with victims' names. The memorial and the museum are set to open Sunday, on the  10th anniversary of the attacks.
"I believe the rebirth and  revitalization of Lower Manhattan will be remembered as one of the  greatest comeback stories in American history," Bloomberg told the group.  "And I believe it will stand as our greatest monument to those we lost on 9/11."

Hi, I'm (not really... don't wanna get sued) Mayor Bloomberg.  I want you to forget that pesky little terrorist attack since those oh, 2606... I think... people died when the Towers, uh, fell.  Calling it "Ground Zero" is scaring people away and it's such an old fashioned name anyway... sorta like ""Pearl Harbor" or stuff like that.  I mean come on! I've cured the city of smoking, traffic and pretty soon gun crimes (if I can get President Obama to sign that exemption against that pain in the butt 2nd Amendment thing).  I mean, people have forgotten pretty much, right?

Bloomberg is the worst politician in the United States of America.  Worse than Bush, Obama, Bill Clinton, and anybody else you care to dislike.  He is more like a dictator than a mayor.  As a resident New Yorker, he is a tyrant.  He will ban cigarettes, alcohol, salt, and god knows what else.  Why elect a billionaire to office?  Why why why I ask?

"...The largest tower at the new World Trade Center will reach 1,776 feet, becoming the tallest building in the country when completed, while towers two, three, and four will each be successively shorter."  

Seems to me it needs to be named "Opportunity Plaza".  Way to go New York, give those who want to do America harm something much grander to target and try to take down.

I am no fan of Mayor Bloomberg, and I have admired Rudy G. ever since the attacks. So saying, I have to say that the preoccupation at Ground Zero is not helping the victims...it is playing into the exact wishes of the maniacs who plotted the carnage.
Think about it...every time we see a tape of the Towers falling, we see (rightfully so) panicked Americans, victims leaping out of windows...it is horrible and sad, but each viewing gives the terrorist scum exactly what they desired...a forum! I lived in Germany during the era of the Red Brigade, and kidnapping/torture of American military was a very real and constant threat. While there, I came to admire the way the Israelis handle the constant threat they face: they do not give their tormentors the satisfaction of repeated viewings. When there is a bombing, they will describe the area, respectfully name the people caught in the tragedy, and deny the a**hole scum any added attention. Then, quietly, they go in and take the terrorists out. Their commandos are lethal, and they get the job done, just like our guys when they aren't handcuffed by showboating politicos who want to use deterrents as campaign tools.
People, wise up! I knew some of the victims at the Puzzle Palace, admire the heck out of the passengers in Pennsylvania...and I wish there never was a bunch of fanatics dive-bombing New York, but I think we need to make this next 9/11 memorial our last. Not out of any disrespect to the victims of this tragedy, but out of a need to deny the cowards who are still alive and gloating the sight of our grief. Let our military do what they could always do...take out the trash!

They might as well call it Ground Zero, since the towers were demolished with explosives anyway and crumbled like they were timed explosives. Ground zero means the point of detonation, no?

Its better to forget what happened than to remember. DO NOT forget the people who died. But do not remember how they died. DO NOT remember the evil that happened because that is exactly what Bin Laden wanted. just because he is dead does not mean our anger (if any) will not fuel the other followers. Remember to forget, but do not forget to remember who died.

Mayor Bloomberg is right..I feel it is appropriate to call WTC-Pheonix 1 and 2 respectively, as it is no more a ground zero and an upcoming,raising ,strong buildings, with lots of good wishes from people in NYC/NY, people from all over USA , people around the world as well.

"All he did was change the name. It's not like he slapped every victim in the face by it."Actually that is exactly what he did! Bloomberg is the LAST person who could properly assess how much healing has occurred and now he has enraged us again. He needs to keep his #$%$ mouth shut! Let us forever call this place GROUND ZERO so that we NEVER forget.

REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of Pan Am flight 103! 
REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993!
REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the Marine Barracks in Lebanon! 
REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the Military Barracks in Saudi Arabia! 
REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the American Embassies in Africa ! 
REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the USS COLE! 
REMEMBER the MUSLIM attack on 9/11/2001 ! 
REMEMBER all the AMERICAN lives that were lost in those vicious MUSLIM 
attacks!
That is how “peace loving” Muslims voice their disapproval of the western world. Compare to that the burning of a few hundred Korans and put it in the proper perspective. Would all those people who object to the Koran burning prefer that he follows the Muslim method to express his disapproval and kills a few thousand innocent people instead? I find it a rather mild way to express disapproval compared to Muslim methods.
The government should honor the separation of state and church and keep its nose out of this mess. 
The Muslim outcry against the proposed Koran burning has been far louder than the outcry against the combined murders listed above. Muslims have allowed and accepted terrorist organizations within their religion who murder at will. As long as Muslims do not stop terrorists and allow the silent moral and financial support they can expect more severe retributions in the future. 
Muslims have invited responses to their murdering actions and have only themselves to blame.

We can call it whatever we want to call it, much to the chagrin of Mr. Napoleon Bloomberg. This "man" is all about the nanny state and since he is not from NYC, nor did he experience it the way we lifelong residents did, he can kiss my you know what.

What else does he want people to call it? Ive gotten use to calling it Ground Zero. I live in Jersey City and everyday I look across the river at the empty skyline. I was 14 and have been calling it that for the last 10 years, I can no longer call it the World Trade Center or The Twin Tower. I just got use to calling it the Freedom Tower. This is just riduculous.

When are they going to give 9/11 a rest?  It's over, people. It's been ten years. I bet no one even thinks of someone who died in a car accident ten years ago. Enough is enough. I refuse to turn the TV on every time 9/11 rolls around. It's just a photo op for all the politicians. I'm sure the families have moved on. Let it go!

Q-poll puts Perry ahead by 6 over Romney, 14 over Bachmann
 And 13 over Palin. We’ve had the media polls and Zogby tell us that Rick Perry has become the frontrunner in the Republican presidential primary polling at the moment.  Now we can add an academic poll as well.  Quinnipiac’s latest survey, released this morning, shows the Texas governor with an six-point lead over Mitt Romney, and 14 points over

Video: Dems accuse Tea Party of wanting minorities “hanging on a tree,” “at war” with a black President
 Despicable and desperate. What happens when your entire political philosophy is so discredited that you can’t even make a coherent argument for it any longer? If you’re Rep. Andre Carson (D-IN), it’s simple — you just call your opponents who are winning the debate “racists” and accuse them of being comfortable with lynching: A top lawmaker in the View the

Giuliani still mulling a presidential run
 Romney’s worst nightmare? Sarah Palin isn’t the only Republican keeping primary voters guessing.  The one-time frontrunner for the 2008 GOP nomination may still decide to throw his hat in the ring in the 2012 cycle — and that will be bad for another recently-deposed frontrunner: Giuliani says he’s seriously eyeing another run for the nomination despite the spectacular Read this post »

NLRB agrees to new rules that will harm workers, job creation
 Priorities. The National Labor Relations Board yesterday issued three decisions that will make it easier for workers to unionize even when a majority of workers prefer to remain non-union.

Obama administration sues to block AT&T – T-Mobile merger
 Hmmm. Here’s a bit of a surprise: The U.S. government sued to block AT&T’s proposed $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile USA Inc., saying the deal would “substantially lessen competition” in the wireless market. The Justice Department complaint was filed today in federal court in Washington. The U.S. is seeking a declaration that Dallas-based AT&T’s takeover of Read this post »

 THE CONFIDENCE RECESSION: There is no way to sugarcoat this. The expectation of rotten times ahead colors purchasing and hiring decisions, leading to a further contraction of the economy. Low confidence begets low growth which in turn begets low confidence. The president and the Democrats keep promising more spending and taxing. But that’s not a recipe to improve the outlook of investors, consumers and employers. . . The trap for many conservatives is to likewise fall into the habit of talking exclusively about budgets, debt and government spending. The missing element is growth. What should …

Your Lying Eyes
 In 1986 Tim Cole, a student at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for a rape he did not commit. He was exonerated in 2009, a decade after he died behind bars from a severe asthma attack at the age of 39. Like three-quarters of the defendants who are cleared by DNA evidence, Cole was convicted based on sincere yet inaccurate eyewitness testimony—a problem the New Jersey Supreme Court highlighted last week when it revised the state’s rules for pretrial hearings and jury instructions based on three decades of research exposing the fallibility…

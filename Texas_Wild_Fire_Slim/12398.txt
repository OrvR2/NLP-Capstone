Daily Horoscope for September 12

 Cancer
Today's Full Moon may bring personal differences to the surface, but this can be a good thing. If you and your associates can keep an open mind, all parties involved can learn and grow. Avoid people who are only interested in making you see their point of view. In the same way, do not try to force your beliefs or opinions on anyone.

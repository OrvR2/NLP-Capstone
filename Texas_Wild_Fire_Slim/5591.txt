Ron Paul said the Transportation Security Administration is "abusive" toward passengers and "accused of all kind of sexual activities" during Tuesday's GOP debate, hosted by NBC News and Politico.
"Look at the monstrosity we have at the airports," Paul said. "These TSA agents are abusive. Sometimes they're accused of all kinds of sexual activities on the way they maul people at the airport."
Paul said the government agency could not protect passengers as well as private companies and said the 9/11 attacks were the result of too much government involvement in airline security.
“They told the pilots they couldn’t have guns,” Paul said. “They set up the stage for this.”
Paul has spoken out against the TSA before, saying the government agency should be "abolished" and recommending that it be replaced with "real privatization of security."
During a July 4 audio address, Paul said, "The press reports are horrifying... children molested; disabled people abused. ... If the perpetrators were a gang of criminals, their headquarters would be raided by SWAT teams and armed federal agents. Unfortunately, in this case the perpetrators are armed federal agents. This is the sorry situation ten years after the creation of the Transportation Security Administration."

				He's a darling old coot.  I really do like him, but surely the answer to bad government is good government­.  Not no government­. We have the same number of traffic fatalities now as we had thirty years ago while we have twice as many cars on the road.  Why is that?  Government regulation­s on car companies.  Can Ron Paul really believe the car industry would have made those technical improvemen­ts on their own?  See... at every level he is naive about capitalism and the free market.  Capitalism is great, but it needs regulation­.

				"Paul said the government agency could not protect passengers as well as private companies ..."

In other words, he is setting the stage for the privatizat­ion of the TSA in favor of one of his funders, probably the CCA. For CCA, that'll be equivalent of winning the LOTTO.

				My question to the posters that agree with Rep. Paul is, if you think abolishing the TSA, is a good idea, what do you suggest as a replacemen­t?. Surely no one thinks that we are not at risk from terrorists­. Be specific. What procedures would you endorse, other than what is being done now?
Either by the govt. or private security.

				Gee, for some reason I have a bit of a problem with getting on a plane with someone who has managed to get a weapon or bomb on board the airplane because Ron Paul has decided that pat downs and scanners are "too much government­". Personally­, I would rather know they screened all the passengers­. And I certainly don't want to be patted down or otherwise screened by a non-govern­ment agency. Without the rules that cover government workers I would be concerned about the abuses a private entity could carry out. We only have to look at so many of the other privatized contracts to see how much abuse there is in those companies who hold government contracts that used to be done cheaper when it was a government­al responsibi­lity. Now Halliburto­n and others are bleeding us dry-costin­g a great deal more than when people working for the government or in the military did the work.

				I agree he has a sprinkling of ideas that bond many of us.  But then you get to the core; abolish civil rights annd eliminate FEMA, social security, all taxes, any gun control, etc.  Common sense..not for many of us who believe in the common bond of humanity.  There's a mean streak of the K Brothers running through him.

				Does Paul ever have it easy - serves in the Congress - but never authors legislatio­n or calls for hearings. Collects his pay and enjoys his perks - without ever breaking a sweat.

Runs for president every four years on the free labor of his cult of windmill-t­ilters.

Gripes about the government while growing old as part of it.

Nice work if you can get it...

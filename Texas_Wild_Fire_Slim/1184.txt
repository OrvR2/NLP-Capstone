Alexander Skarsgard is definitely taking advantage of his time on the East Coast
The "True Blood" star was spotted enjoying the local scene in the Hamptons over Labor Day weekend.
According to Page Six, the newly single Skarsgard hit up Water Mill’s Stadium Red Estate and Southampton’s South Pointe Saturday night, ordering multiple shots and taking pictures with fans.
But the party didn't stop on Saturday. According to E! Online, Skarsgard was spotted at The Surf Lodge in Montauk Sunday night, posing for even more photos with adoring fans and talking up some very lucky ladies, including Alexandra Keating, who is the daughter of the former Prime Minister of Australia.
The actor and his girlfriend of two years, Kate Bosworth, split in July but the two star in the upcoming "Straw Dogs," which hits theaters September 16.
Skarsgard is currently filming "What Maisie Knew" in New York City and we honestly can't get enough of him. Check out some of our favorite photos below!

				Pretty...b­ut not TOO pretty.
This one is the sort that stills really don't do justice to.
Now motion pics...YES­.
I suspect his real mettle will show after True Blood. 
He has an genuine actors face that moves, acts, and reacts.
Give him ten years, and I bet he is doing Oscar worthy stuff.

				Quite possibly. It isn't his fault, though, that A. Ball has the hots for Stephen Moyer and is ignoring the events of the other seasons because his baby boy id married to paquin in real life.
No independen­t woman, as Sookie if supposed to be, would ignore the fact that a man let her be beaten half to death in order to make her indebted to him when they met, drained her to the point of death and raped her. 
I was looking forward to the shower scene for years, and will never forgive Ball for ruining it.

				OK, when did Bill rape her? I've read this elsewhere and, being a huge fan of the show, I don't remember this. It's a major thing to be raped - wouldn't I remember it?!?!?

AB has said that Bill & Sookie will likely end up together again but that it'll be a long road. I'm sorry but just this 1 seasons of separation isn't long enough. I want more Eric & Sookie!!! Want to see the fallout between these 2 after his gaining his memory back. But I guess it's too much to ask for. They even had her grandmothe­r say that it's temporary.

				In the back of the van when she, Tara and Alcide rescued her from Edgington'­s mansion last season, Bill raped her and drained her to the point of near death. The rape was glossed over because everyone was so focused on the fairy blood and no transfusio­n stuff, but he raped her.

				And another thing. Stephen Moyer cannot be AB's golden boy. If he is, then he's nuts. The fans love Alexander. Period. Whenever there's a group interview with them, he's the one that gets the manic response from the crowd.

				Alan Ball has been quoted numerous times saying that Bill and Sookie are "soul mates" because in real life Anna and Stephen are. He obviously thinks the fans will stick just to watch Alexander.
Bill is reduced to just a minor character in the books, sort of like the first love you had before you find out how intense the real thing is. Alan Ball refuses to let Sookie move past Bill.

Someone spotted a UFO during the Notre Dame weather delay By      Chris Chase


If you believe one conspiracy website, the oddest thing that took place Saturday at Notre Dame Stadium weren't the hundreds of lightning strikes that caused a pair of long weather delays or the fact that the Fighting Irish got worked by a second-rate team from a third-rate conference. It was the presence of extraterrestrial life hovering above the stadium.
Amateur skywatchers noticed a number of unidentified flying objects circling the stadium during the first weather delay. This clip, taken from NBC's broadcast, proves beyond a reasonable doubt that wacky conspiracy theorists are proficient at uploading video to the Internet:
 
Cue the "X-Files" theme while I make a few observations:
1. You know what flies around huge, enclosed stadiums when the wind is whipping around during a thunderstorm? Everything. Programs, ticket stubs, popcorn containers, hot dog wrappers, napkins, the band's sheet music, copies of "Infinite Jest" that were brought to the game by a freshman attending the football game ironically; you name it. There are literally thousands of better explanations for what that little white thing was than a UFO.
2. The UFO was voted No. 23 in this week's coaches' poll.
3. Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly is considering starting the alien occupants of the vessel at starting quarterback this weekend against Michigan.
4. Is it coincidence that the UFOs flew over South Bend when Eastern New Mexico University in Roswell, N.M., had a home football game the same day? The same day people!
5. If the aliens were looking for intelligent life they were unsuccessful, likely because they were unable to discern why NBC would continue broadcasting games of a team that hasn't won a major bowl game since 1990.
Thanks, Yardbarker

0 users disliked this comment Andy Anderson 7 minutes ago Report Abuse Chase, do you know what UFO means? You listed a pretty good list of what items it could be but still don't know which item it was. UFO is not AFO or Alien in Flying Object it is Unidentified Flying Object and you simply proved that you could not identify what it was and were simply grasping at straws of what it could be. Thus it's still a UFO right up until someone say's I saw where it landed, it was this paper plate right here.

0 users disliked this comment David 10 minutes ago Report Abuse @#$%!!! USF is a second rate team??!! A few years ago USF was ranked 2nd in the nation! The last time Notre Dame was a powerhouse or relevant was almost 20 years ago!! Chris Chase.. I guess this what I can expect from a forth rate "sports writer" from a tenth rate "sports website".    Go back to chasing stupid home improvement articles.. or what ever you did before you got this gig

It doesn't make much sense to put all your eggs in the basket of Tebow and Quinn.    Am I missing something???    Here's a crazy thought...get rid of Quinn and let Orton and Tebow compete for the starting job.    Maybe the team just doesn't like Orton as a person.

0 users disliked this comment Richard 17 minutes ago Report Abuse Misleading headline, yahoo flubs again.   It's not a UFO, it's a rod.   It's not visible to the naked eye, it only shows up during playback. So there's no wonder that nobody at the game saw it.   It's a phenomena thats been showing up in video for decades.

They, I assume it is the government, have been using them   at events where thousands of people are expected to attend. They are very difficult to see unless there are dark clouds in the background. They can be easily seen at night with night vision goggles though.

1 users disliked this comment Robert 24 minutes ago Report Abuse AWESOME !    Another BLURRY video of a flying object, that we can't tell what the hell it is; so it must be an alein spacecraft.    Why an alien spacecraft ?    Because it is blurry & you can't tell what the hell it is.   That's total, 100 % proof that it's an alien spaceship.

And yet; somehow I can still manage to CLEARLY, video a fighter jet at an air show, flying supersonic with a simple, digital camcorder set for high speed motion.   Imagine that.

The technological powers that I posses in my very hands ! ...   With this super high tech camcorder of mine... I AM... going to video Bigfoot !   ... right after my interview with E.T.

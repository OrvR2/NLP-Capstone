 Nov. 19, 2010 – CROCKETT, Texas – Although the past year has presented hard work and challenges for Texas Forest Service employees, the agency united recently, renewing a commitment to service at its annual personnel meeting. Hundreds gathered at the Crockett Civic Center for games, food, fellowship and an awards ceremony. Director Tom Boggus reflected on the high caliber of staff among the agency’s ranks.“There are no second-class citizens in this agency,” he said. “This is an organization of service. It’s not an easy thing to get to work here, but once you’re here, you’re family. We want you to make us better.”A team of 14 employees, chaired by Professional Development Coordinator Stacy Overby, planned the program of events for the Nov. 18 personnel meeting.“This is an important time for our employees to get together and celebrate their hard work from the previous year,” Overby said. “It’s a way for the agency to say thank you to the men and women who make Texas Forest Service a great place to work.”The agency has been under review by the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission for the past several months. Staff from the Sunset Commission filed a report making recommendations to increase efficiency in the agency. The report was, in part, refuted by Texas Forest Service, which also provided more information to the commission in a self-evaluation.A recent public hearing was held in Austin, at which no one spoke against Texas Forest Service. A second hearing is scheduled in mid-December. “We’re positive,” Boggus said. “People like us and we’ve got a good reputation in Austin. That speaks volumes to the people in this room.”Boggus recalled a statement made during the public hearing that Texas Forest Service is “just a BB in a barrel” of the Texas A&M System. “It’s just a BB, but you make a lot of difference,” he told employees.The agency director then recalled some of the good work achieved by Texas Forest Service over the past year, dropping a BB into a metal canister as he ticked off the accomplishments. “Before long, we start making noise,” he said, shaking the canister. “We make service noise. Whatever names they want to call us, we’re going to keep making noise.”The Bronze Smokey Bear Award, an honor from the National Association of Foresters and U.S. Forest Service, was presented to Boggus at the personnel meeting. The award is an honor for service having impact within a state over a minimum two-year period.

BASTROP, Texas (AP) — Texas Gov. Rick Perry unexpectedly canceled plans to visit areas hit by a massive Central Texas wildfire.
A  Perry spokeswoman said the governor's scheduled visit on Saturday of  damaged areas in Bastrop County near Austin as well as his participation  in a news conference with local and state officials did not take place  because of "logistical issues" with Perry arriving in Bastrop on time.
Perry's office on Friday had announced the governor would visit the area.
Perry  spokeswoman Allison Castle said the governor was in Austin and was  keeping in regular contact with officials on the wildfire.
Castle  did not say when Perry would return to Bastrop. Perry visited the area  earlier this week after he cut short a presidential campaign trip to  deal with the crisis.

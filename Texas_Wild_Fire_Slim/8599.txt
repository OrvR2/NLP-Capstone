   New Jersey and Section One Audio Visual – Perfect Together – Miss New Jersey Pageant 2011PRWeb – 1 hr 51 mins ago





   For the First Time Ever, Section One Audio Visual was engaged for the 2011 Miss New Jersey Pageant held on the Music Pier Stage in Ocean City New Jersey. Section One Audio Visual provided Extensive Services Including LD (Lighting Design), Lighting Programming and Operations, TD (Technical Director), Set Design, Video System Design and Support with Multiple Large-Format Video Projectors and Video Projection Screens along with Multiple-Program Video Switching.Ocean City NJ (PRWEB) September 08, 2011  Section One Audio Visual, with its Headquarters located in Princeton NJ, provided the Miss New Jersey Foundation – a non-profit scholarship organization for young women that determines “Miss New Jersey” each year for competition in the famed “Miss America” Pageant – with extensive Audio Visual Equipment and Services including both Design and Full Production Services for the 2011 Miss New Jersey Pageant.
This summer, Miss New Jersey 2011 was announced and crowned on the Stage of the Ocean City Music Pier in Ocean City, NJ. Katharyn Nicolle, 20, was the winner. Miss Nicolle will proceed to compete in the National Miss America Pageant. The Miss New Jersey Pageant has been taking place on this Ocean City Music Pier stage for an estimated 10 years.  Ocean City has been a proud sponsor of the Pageant and has hosted it within its very own Music Pier – a space that accommodates an audience of over 900.
There were a total of 23 contestants from across New Jersey competing for the Miss New Jersey crown. The contestants, restricted to ages 17 to 24, train long and hard. The rehearsals on the Ocean City stage took place every day throughout an entire week, with the shows spanning three nights.
Robin Filippone, co-producer and two-time former contestant in the Miss New Jersey Pageant, witnessed Section One Audio Visual in action at a major Event for another non-profit organization.  It was there that she realized after seeing the multiple large Video Projection Screens that the 2011 Miss New Jersey Pageant should be Video-driven and, after consulting with Section One Audio Visual, also realized that they were the right company to do it. Hence, Ms. Filippone’s idea was born.
Section One Audio Visual designed and executed a very elaborate Stage Production including Set Design, Lighting Design (LD), Technical Director(TD), and multiple Video Projectors and large Video Projection Screens with Video Switching that facilitated different Media – including Pre-Production Video and  Image Magnification (IMAG) from 3 Video Cameras – across different screens. A substantial amount of Theatrical Equipment was also brought in by Section One Audio Visual to supplement the Theater’s existing Lighting Instruments and other Theatrical Equipment.
“The Audio Visual services were beyond all expectations. Section One Audio Visual deserves the highest of praise and I thank them for all that they did for us” exclaimed Lou Barthold, Executive Director of the Miss New Jersey Foundation.  “I have heard nothing but great comments and high praise on the show in total and much of that is due to their professionalism and expertise. Great job!”
“I was thrilled for my team to be such a vital part of the 2011 Miss New Jersey Pageant and was quite pleased with the results. As a Corporate Audio Visual Company, we differ from most of our competition because of our Creativity, Passion for the Industry, and extensive Stage Experience in Theater environments. We look forward to many more future shows with them” stated Howard Schneider, CEO of Section One Audio Visual. 
Earlier this year, Section One Audio Visual also provided Audio, Lighting, Staging and Drapery for an Event for New Jersey State Governor Chris Christie at a hotel on the Jersey Shore with over 500 supporters of the Governor.

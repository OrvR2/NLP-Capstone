Harry still thinking like a loser on his debt bill.

Sad, isn’t it?
Or maybe he doesn’t want to win this one.  Would you, in his shoes? Via AoSHQ:
Reid to GOP: It’s your fault if stimulus stalls
As the $820 billion stimulus package heads to the upper chamber, Senate Democratic leaders are launching a pre-emptive strike.
In a Thursday afternoon news conference, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid urged Senate Republicans not to line up against the bill, and says Republicans will be blamed for any delay in the landmark economic legislation.
“If we don’t [pass the bill], it’s not our fault, we’re trying,” Reid said. “The president has done a remarkable job covering all the bases on Capitol Hill.”

Yeah, yeah, yeah, Mr. President.  Just pass your debt bill, already.

Gridlock?  What gridlock?  That bill got passed by House Democrats, didn’t it?  You’ve got enough Democratic votes in the Senate, don’t you?  So why don’t you go ahead with it, already, and stop trying to get us on-board?
After all: you won.
Moe Lane
PS: Sucks to be you, Wall Street.  Particularly since all y’all voted for him in the first place.  I believe that even the British would accept that as being ironic.

Stimulus Watch: how THEY are spending YOUR money.

Via Ace of Spade HQ’s headlines, and very, very timely.
No explanation or expansion really needed for this one; just go, search, and marvel.  And maybe give a Senator or two a call on the subject?

I Brake For Zombies.

No, really.  The damn things have the mass of a living human, remember?  Try to barrel through a crowd of them and you end up crashing the car, which probably means that you’ll break a window, and then it’s all over for you, Sparky.  If you absolutely can’t go around, just take your foot off of the gas pedal, get down to three miles an hour, and keep swerving the wheel left and right to sort of nudge the undead hordes out of the way.  With any luck, none of them will have the leverage needed to smash the glass.  With even more luck, they’ll not smell your tasty, tasty brains in the first place.
…this is what I think of, typically, when I see stories like:
Construction signs warn of zombies
Hackers change public safety message
This is simply the sort of person that I am, and everybody around me has had to learn to accept that.
Moe Lane
PS: The Zombie Survival Guide doesn’t think you should drive at all.  To which I say, try transporting more than 10 lb. of looted medical materials to your isolated fortress on a bicycle and see how far you get.
PPS: Heh.  I guess that AoSHQ was saving this story for Saturday, too.  Theirs have more pictures.

Still no eruption on the Alaskan volcano.

But it’s starting to look like it’ll be soon:
If Mt. Redoubt blows, Alaskans may get a light show
The volcano watch for Alaska’s Mt. Redoubt continues apace.
According to the Anchorage Daily News:
An observation flight by scientists this afternoon reported no sign of ash emission yet, but discovered significant steaming from a new melt depression at the mouth of the summit crater….
That flight took place Jan. 30.
Not much to add to this, except that: volcanoes are pretty cool, and if there’s an eruption where no-one gets hurt it’d be an interesting and educational thing to see.  So if you live near Mt. Redoubt, move well away from the area, please.  Let’s not have another Mount St. Helens.

Not In Your Name, International ANSWER.

Or Code Pink’s, for that matter.  Or anybody else who thinks that hanging with them is neat.
Not then.
Not now.
Not ever.
Iraqis vote in landmark elections
Iraqis are electing new provincial councils in the first nationwide vote in four years, with the Sunni minority expected to turn out in strength.
After a slow start, correspondents said voting was brisk, including among Sunni Muslims, who largely boycotted the last elections.
The vote is seen as a test of Iraq’s stability ahead of a general election due later this year.
Security is tight and thousands of observers are monitoring the polls.

I have tentatively changed the background image.

Not entirely happy with it, but it’s certainly brighter around here now.
Now would be an excellent time for an artist-type to chime in.

No, really, Obama DIDN’T ask any of his nominees about their taxes.

I think that Jake Tapper isn’t going to be getting a Christmas card from the Obama administration.  Ever.
ABC News has obtained the Senate Finance Committee Report on Tom Daschle’s nomination to be Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, which indicates that Daschle’s tax problems were even more substantial than earlier reported.
The report indicates that Daschle’s failure to pay more than $101,000 taxes on the car and driver a wealthy friend let him use from 2005 through 2007 is not the only tax issue the former Senate Majority Leader has been dealing with since his December nomination prompted a more thorough examination of his income tax returns.
Mr. Daschle also didn’t report $83,333 in consulting income in 2007.
Via AoSHQ, and let me just add this: I expect to see Tom Daschle lay hands upon a leper at his confirmation hearing and heal that man of his affliction.  Because it’s going to take about that much of a mitigating factor to make this pick for HHS palatable.
Moe Lane
PS: Does any Democratic politician pay his or her taxes properly, and on time?  Do any of them know how to, even?  It’s a heck of a thing to ask, but circumstances kind of require it right now.

Maxfield Parrish is apparently in the public domain!

Which explains why there’s umpteen billion examples of his work online.




















Anybody got a favorite that they wouldn’t mind seeing for a while?

The Darth Giger gave it a run for its money, though.

I was sent an email on this Star Wars photoshop contest (supposedly the link’s on Fark).  Some pretty good, some not so much.  This one is probably the best so far:

I’d like to note for the record that the original has always kind of haunted me.  Something about the endless Friday night at 3 AM that it represents.  This, on the other hand, does not.

May 5, 2011 – WEST TEXAS – Residents in Brewster and Presidio counties interested in learning how to protect themselves from wildfire are invited to two town hall meetings next week.Meetings are set for Tuesday, May 10, at the Brewster County Courthouse in Alpine and Wednesday, May 11, at the Presidio Activity Center in Presidio. Both meetings are set for 7 p.m. Representatives from Texas Forest Service and West Texas fire departments will be on hand to answer questions and talk about what you can do to protect your home and family from wildfire. For example, you can reduce potential losses by adopting Firewise landscaping practices 100 to 200 feet around your home. That includes moving firewood and clearing dead and dense vegetation.Wildland Urban Interface Specialist Patrick Allen stressed that wildfires are a community-wide problem, which means reducing risks to homes and property is everyone’s responsibility.“More than 80 percent of wildfires in Texas occur within 2 miles of a community,” Allen said, reminding residents that wildfires recently raged through West Texas and likely will again. “We want to encourage residents to take proactive measures that could end up saving lives and property.”For more information, visit www.texasfirestorm.org and www.texasfirewise.org.

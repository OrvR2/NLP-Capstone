NEW YORK (AP) — A calico cat named Willow, who disappeared from a home near the Rocky Mountains five years ago, was found Wednesday on a Manhattan street and will soon be returned to a family in which two of the three kids and one of the two dogs may remember her.How she got to New York, nearly 1,800 miles away, and the kind of life she lived in the city are mysteries.But thanks to a microchip implanted when she was a kitten, Willow will be reunited in Colorado with her owners, who had long ago given up hope."To be honest, there are tons of coyotes around here, and owls," said Jamie Squires, of Boulder. "She was just a little thing, five and a half pounds. We put out the 'Lost Cat' posters and the Craigslist thing, but we actually thought she'd been eaten by coyotes."Squires and her husband, Chris, were "shocked and astounded" when they got a call Wednesday from Animal Care & Control, which runs New York City's animal rescue and shelter system.Willow had been found on East 20th Street by a man who took her to a shelter."My husband said, 'Don't say anything to the kids yet. We have to make sure,'" Squires said. "But then we saw the picture, and it was Willow. It's been so long."ACC Executive Director Julie Bank said a scanner found the microchip that led to the Squires family."All our pets are microchipped," Squires said. "If I could microchip my kids, I would."The children are 17, 10 and 3 years old, so the older two remember Willow, Squires said. As for the 3-year-old, "She saw the photo and said, 'She's a pretty cat.'"The Squireses also have a yellow Labrador named Roscoe, who knew Willow, and an English mastiff named Zoe."We had another dog back then, too, and I remember that Willow would lie with them as they all waited to be fed," Squires said. "She thought she was a dog."Squires said Willow escaped in late 2006 or early 2007 when contractors left a door open during a home renovation.Since then, the family had moved about 10 miles from Broomfield to Boulder, but it kept its address current with the microchip company.Bank recommended that all pet owners use microchips.She said Willow, who now weighs 7 pounds, is healthy and well-mannered and probably has not spent her life on the mean streets of Manhattan. But there are no clues about her trip east or anything else in the five years she's been missing.Squires seemed a bit worried about a possible New York state of mind."I don't know what kind of life she's had, so I don't know what her personality will be like," she said. When Willow disappeared, she said, "She was a really cool cat, really sweet."The ACC and the Squireses were trying to arrange for transportation back to Colorado and health certificates and said it might be two weeks before the reunion. Willow may spend some time with a foster family in New York."The kids can't wait to see her," Squires said. "And we still have her little Christmas stocking."

Some don't care for cats but they are really wonderful amazing creatures.  There sure are a whole lot of paranoid people commenting.

Putting microchips in your pets is the best thing anyone can do for their animals. All 5 of my pets are chipped and if I could I would put a GPS chip in them. I often wonder where my ourdoor cat goes all day, but I know when it gets dark she comes home or else I start looking.

How about saying HER home instead of A home? Or better yet "She is moving in with her old family in a new home." Outside of me hating on the writer, this story was great. I'm glad the cat for her family again.

great story n all but yeah i agree with these other people, dont ever let the gov or anyone else put micro chips in you.. animals are fine..just not in you... last thing you need is a way for gov to monitor your every move, they already do enough of that with credit card strips and other card strips.... btw the cat escaped so technically if someone picked it up it isn't stealing.. unless it had tags but they prolly thought it was homeless, since people think they dont need tags cause they have a chip... use both on yer pets...and why would u want to put a chip in your child?? it wouldnt help you locate the child just identify it, and if you cant recognize your own child then there is always DNA

"Mean streets of Manhattan"... "worried about a possible New York state of mind".. Nice. I am willing to bet the cat had 10x better chance to survive in NYC without the threat of other wildlife and abundance of food. Maybe the cat thought it had a better chance in an area where there weren't crazy bullied kids who shoot up schools. That New York state of mind is what returned the animal to its original home. Sorry but the niceness of the story was destroyed by the stereotypical.

What is more surprising is that the cat didn't die of cancer from the microchip.

Amazing story. Someone probably "catnapped" or found the cat in Colorado and took her to New York years ago.

Great story.  I'd rather read about a lost and found kitteh than some inconsequential celebrity or politician.  At least cats live in the real world.

Nice, but faked, "happy-ending story",......to bring us closer to accepting microchips being planted in us......so they can track us better.........

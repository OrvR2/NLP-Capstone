Pete Rogers of McKenna Racing forces Cory Jacobi of Bad Decisions out at second base in the fourth inning of their third-place game at Veterans Park on Sunday afternoon.



 
 Team RACC from Santa Clara, Calif., defeated McKenna Racing of Auburn, Wash., 11-7 Sunday for the USSSA Men's Class E Slow Pitch World Championship at Veterans Park in College Station.
The tournament hosted 87 teams from 18 states, including a team from Bryan and one from College Station. Bad Decisions, from San Antonio, lost to McKenna Racing to finish third.
The United States Specialty Sports Association (USSSA) put on the tournament, which began Friday and ended Sunday afternoon. Greg Huchingson is the South Texas State Director for USSSA and was the tournament director for the Men's Class E Slow Pitch World Championships this weekend in College Station. 
Hutchingson said the USSSA was the largest amateur sports association in the world, and slow-pitch softball is its most popular sport.
"This is the world tournament," Hutchingson said. "Teams play all year and go to their respective state tournaments, where they have to qualify by placing at their state tournament, and then there's a national tournament." 
Men's Class E is the largest division by far and the lowest level in the USSSA's slow-pitch division -- but it's still competitive. 
 "This Texas team that took third from San Antonio (Bad Decisions) plays 12 months a year, multiple tournaments in a month," Hutchingson said. "It is very competitive. It's not league night, drink a beer, city league play. This is tournament play."
Most USSSA world championships are held in Kissimmee, Fla., where the organization's headquarters are located. The city of College Station earned the bid for Sunday's event in part because of a strong reputation for hosting softball tournaments.
"You don't just have these tournaments," Huchingson said. "There's a bid process, and the city of College Station stepped up and the city made the financial commitment so that the businesses in the community could reap the rewards. Hotels have been full all weekend."
Hutchingson said he was happy with the decision to hold to tournament in College Station.
"It absolutely was a success," he said. "It was a home run. I was afraid when we initially got it that it would be a bunch of Texas teams coming in and playing each other. But to get a bunch of teams coming in from 18 different states, it exposed our community."

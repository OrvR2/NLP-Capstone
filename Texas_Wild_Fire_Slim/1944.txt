Nevada gunman said detained in 2000 for mental issuesBy Timothy Pratt | Reuters – 13 hrs ago

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - A man who opened fire at a Nevada pancake house, killing three National Guard soldiers and a civilian before shooting himself, was detained for mental health reasons over a decade ago, police said on Wednesday.
The man's family has cited mental illness as a possible factor in Tuesday's shooting rampage, which also wounded seven other people in what investigators said initially appeared to have been a random act of violence.
Eduardo Sencion, 32, had been taken into custody in South Lake Tahoe in 2000 under a California law that allows police to hold a person who presents a danger to themselves or others, South Lake Tahoe police spokesman Lt. David Stevenson said.
Sencion, who worked in South Lake Tahoe at his family's market, was held so he could receive psychiatric evaluation and care, Stevenson said.
Stevenson declined to elaborate on the incident that prompted police to detain Sencion, but said a report did not name any victims and that no weapons were involved.
Sencion walked into an IHOP restaurant in Carson City, Nevada, on Tuesday and opened fire, killing the three uniformed soldiers and a 67-year-old woman and wounding seven others before turning the gun on himself, authorities said.
He initially survived his self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head but later died at an area hospital.
Besides the three Guard soldiers who were shot to death, two of the wounded were also active-duty Guard members.
Carson City Sheriff Kenneth Furlong has said there was no sign that Sencion, a Mexican-born U.S. citizen, knew anyone at the restaurant or had singled out members of the military.
He said investigators were still looking for a motive in  the shooting spree, which he called "the most devastating attack on our community ever."
Furlong also released the names and some details about the four people killed.
Major Heath Kelly, 35, of Reno, had served in Iraq with the Army from 2004-2005, Furlong said, while Sgt. Christian Riege, 38, had served in Afghanistan from 2009-2010.
Also slain were Sgt. Miranda McElhiney, 31, from Reno; and civilian Florence Donovan-Gunderson, 67, from South Lake Tahoe, California, near the Nevada border.

You just never know when somebody is going to go off. This is unfortunate, I really doubt he obtained those firearms legally. Read up on the Texas sniper, he just went off one day, killed his mother, his wife, and went on to the University of Texas where he massacred 16 people and wounded 32. Oh, and he was a U.S. Marine, white if you must know! The truth is it doesn't matter what color you are. I honestly don't understand why people keep mentioning illegal aliens when clearly this guy was a Naturalized U.S. Citizen. Anyway, God rest the souls of the fallen.

We live in a violent world, and its not guns that kill.  Backgrounds check will not work on medical conditions because they are protected by law.  My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of this crime.

Many frustrated people in the US. With guns readily available, more killings are expected. Some were trained to kill in foreign assignments. Now they are back to kill their own kind. No one comes back without being mentally scarred if not also being physically scarred; each questioning the purpose of it all.

to kill any one or body because your crazy is plausible.  To kill people in uniform, is terrorism. To kill yourself, is another way to hide something, not an act of a crazy person.
There is more to this and there is a link to 9/11.

And the racists jump on their soapboxes and shout "illegal". Naturally. Too bad all those good ol' boys never learned to read. Ignorant and proud of it. Just conveniently skip over the part about mental illness, which happens equally among all races.

THREE OTHER "GUNMAN STORIES":

Yahoo is always quick to report news were a bad-guy with a gun victimizes innocent and defenseless good people (Usually people who believe THE REALLY BIG LIE: “You don't need a gun the police will protect you.”) but they are never quick to report stories where the victims weren't defenseless. Here's but three examples of multiple thousands never reported by Yahoo:

In 2007, shortly after pharmacist Jeremy Hoven began working the night shift at Walgreens, the store was robbed by four armed men. Despite workers’ security complaints, Walgreens made no changes, so Hoven obtained a concealed carry permit and purchased a firearm. Earlier this year, Hoven was behind the counter when two masked robbers carrying guns burst inside. According to Police Lt. Delmar Lange, the robbers were “very aggressive and very dangerous in what they did and how they did it.” The robbers ordered all employees into a back room. Hoven fired upon the robbers, likely hitting one and causing both to flee. Unfortunately, Walgreens fired the heroic armed citizen for carrying a gun. (The Herald-Palladium, St. Joseph, MI, 05/10/11)(The Armed Citizen 8/2011)

IT'S A FAMILIAR SENARIO: An armed citizen with a concealed-carry permit is likely once again to have saved multiple lives. Several customers were doing business inside a pawn shop when a man walked inside, pointed a gun toward the ceiling and announced a robbery. Did the gunman intend to shoot the clerk? Would he take hostages? We’ll never know, because a customer with a concealed-carry permit promptly drew a pistol and shot the robber in the stomach. The robber has been charged with aggravated robbery. (KSAT-TV, San Antonio, TX, 06/22/11)(The Armed Citizen 9/2011)

CASHIER THERESA STUCKEY sold a woman groceries, and the next thing she knew the woman was outside pleading for her life. "She was screaming, 'Help, he's trying to kill me!' She was rolling on the ground, trying to get out of the way, but he kept stabbing her" Terrified onlookers yelled at the man and honked their horns. Ignoring the crowd, the rampaging man poured gasoline on the woman and attempted to set her ablaze, but a passerby entered the scene armed with more than a car horn. According to a witness, the Good Samaritan drew a gun and, "He told the man, 'Stop, or I'm going to shoot! And if you run, I'm going to kill you"' Police say the heroic man held the suspect until they arrived; however, he left before anyone
got his name. The victim was listed in good condition at the hospital.

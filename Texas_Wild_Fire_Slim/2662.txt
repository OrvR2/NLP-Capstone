SKorea court upholds Somali pirate's life sentenceAP – 6 hrs ago





SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A South Korean appellate court has upheld a life sentence imposed on a Somali pirate for hijacking a ship and shooting its captain.Five Somali pirates were captured during a raid on a hijacked South Korean-operated cargo ship in the Arabian Sea in January. The South Korean military operation killed eight pirates. During the raid the ship's South Korean captain was shot and wounded by a pirate.A district court in the South Korean city of Busan subsequently sentenced one pirate to life in prison and four other pirates to between 13 and 15 years behind bars.On Thursday the Busan High Court upheld most of the district court's ruling, though it reduced one pirate's sentence by three years.Both the pirates and prosecutors have one week to appeal.

Nice one, let's keep at it. In fact go a bit further, shoot pirates on site if and when they open fire, yep, that's right no arrests, simply act in defence, why has it taken so long, wake up you 'politicians' the seafarers need help.

now that is justice. nine months to complete trial and go thru appeals.  awesome.  why does it take 3 or more years just to bring high profile cases to court here in the us?  and a decade of apeals.

If this is in the US the court would be sued for racism and the pirates would be offered assylum.

hijacking and a firefight ?... and then they get just 13-15 and 1 life sentence ..? what a waste of taxpayer's money.  a bullet to the head would have been more cost effective and would be a better deterrent.

life sentence for shooting a guy in an armed robbery and kidnapping? seems fair to me.

Good!  I've been to South Korea; even had a South Korean girlfriend for a couple of years.  They don't play around with criminals - or coddle them like we often do here.  It wasn't too many years ago that they were just plain executing a lot more of them there!  And I wouldn't underestimate the military unit that re-took that freighter ship either.  Like the American GI's I met there said; "the 'ROK's are tough"!  S.Korea has also contributed many more troops to our so called 'coalition' forces in the middle east that many other "allies" have.  - Hats off to them!

This is just the beginning of change for human on earth. For all those that are of religion, if you understand what you read and believe in it if it is right than instead of finding ways to stop the changes, which we can not do. We should all find a way to make sure all human beings as creatures of this world can make it through those changes to come. Everyone want to make it somehow in life. As long as so few that have not lived the life of so many continue to try and control the so many with unjust hands, everyone will loose in the end. Life is not wrong, we make that way by living for ourselves rather than everyone as a whole.

Instead of putting the burden on tax payers to pay for their trail, clothing, food and housing, just put 1 in the head on the spot when caught!  Maybe then they will get the hit and stop!

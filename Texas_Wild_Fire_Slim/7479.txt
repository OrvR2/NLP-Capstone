Melinda Gates: All lives have equal valueBy Anna RobertsonPostsEmailBy Anna Robertson | Newsmakers – Fri, Mar 11, 2011

With so many Americans struggling to make ends meet, how does an international philanthropist like Melinda Gates convince people to support global causes? In an interview with Yahoo!, Gates said it's as simple as asking Americans to skip their cup of coffee to save a child's life.
Watch here:

The interview was conducted in New York, where Gates, the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, spoke at Tina Brown's Women in the World Summit.
She also responded to questions from the Yahoo! News Facebook community about how the foundation decides where to spend money in America.
Watch here:

In the interview, Gates spoke about how empowering women with the right tools can lift up entire families and communities (watch here), and she shared her outlook on balancing demanding work with raising her three children (watch here).

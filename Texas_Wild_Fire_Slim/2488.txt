Groupon discounts can make certain events much cheaper (that is if you can find 6 other people that also want to attend a champagne tasting), but is it possible to use this model for tuition?  
National Louis University in Chicago will be the first school to find out. In an effort to grow its graduate teaching program, the private institution will be offering a 60% discount for an introduction to teaching course this fall.
The Chicago-Tribune  has more: 
With the Groupon, prospective students can save nearly 60 percent on tuition for the single, three-credit course and earn credit toward a graduate degree, said Jocelyn Zivin, the vice president of marketing and communications for the Chicago-based, private university.

"There are all kinds of factors in the K-12 world that are really discouraging teachers and people seeking teaching degrees," Zivin said. "We'd like (potential students) to understand what the realities are, whether you are committed to this profession ... and see if you have what it takes."
Regular tuition for the course is $2,232, but with the Groupon discount, it drops to $950. The deal will go live on Tuesday,  officials said. 
"This is... an opportunity for our subscribers to take the first step toward what could be a new career," Julie Mossler, Groupon's communications director, told Mashable. "National Louis joins an innovative list of merchants who were the first in their industry to experiment with collective buying power, and do it on Groupon."

This university is out of their minds. Even 950 is a TOTAL RIPOFF.

				Unless your job doesn't require higher education your statement is false.  Even if your job doesn't require it, what about learning for the sake of learning?  To say that a relatively minor investment of $2,000.00 considerin­g the payback of the course of one's life time isn't worth it is shortsight­ed a best.

				That is silly.  Drive matters more than a college degree.   Honestly most careers you can get in with four years of experience much better than four years of college.   The exceptions being certain profession­als like lawyers, doctors, and teachers.   If you have a degree and your job doesn't require it in my opinion you wasted money.

My generation and those younger than me have been lied to about what a degree can bring them.   This is one of the factors that has lead to college education skyrocketi­ng in cost.  Most people do not need a degree.  I have managed many college grads making $10 or less per hour.   And that is just sad.   I was making the same as them out of High School and that was my first job.

Currently I make about $10,000 more than the average college educated worker.  We have a service economy and while some positions do require an education most do not.   

Also remember that when you compare the average incomes of people it is the drive and skills that cause this difference­.  The education level merely goes along with this.  Those more driven are more likely to seek a higher education.   But a driven individual without an education can go further with less debt if they plan to enter an industry that does not require a degree.			





Aaron_Doud: That is silly. Drive matters more than a college degree.

				$2,000 - That's a F'ing rip off.  You can go to community college and take MULTIPLE courses for WAY less than $950.  It's it Intro to Teaching.  It is not like you're going abroad for an internatio­nal business course.  

And what happens to your Intro to Teaching course?  It's not like that will work on a resume for a teaching job.  You need way more than one course for that.

				Compared to the tuition at the university­s I attended that's pratically a steal. Whether it's worth the money or not is dependent on what you do with your college degree. I do agree that the tuitions are extremely inflated, but $950 isn't exactly breaking the bank.

				I know out here in California the price of a higher education went through the roof. I had a course at California State University at Northridge and it cost over $2,000. When I started at a State University in the 1970s my cost was about $67.
More recently I had a class at the University of California­, Riverside. Through their Extension Program I saved a bundle by spending about $570. Warnings arrived earlier last month telling me to expect a large fee increase when I return. Groupon please work your magic in California on our public and private universiti­es.

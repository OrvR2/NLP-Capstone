Turkey denounced the report declaring it null and void and after demanding Israel apologize for the activists' deaths and compensate the families, downgraded diplomatic ties with Jerusalem. At Sunday's cabinet meeting. Netanyahu vowed Israel would not apologize but regrets the loss of lives. Netanyahu said he hoped to find a way to improve ties with Ankara. Israel reserves the basic right to defend its citizens and does not need to apologize for working to protect them, Netanyahu said.

US President Barak Obama suggested this week that Israel and Palestine respect the borders set-up back in 1967. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , however, says that isn't going to happen. Already involved in three wars, is US involvement on the ongoing issue even necessary? Former US Ambassador to Saudia Arabia Chas W Freeman, Jr says that as long as America continues to supply Israel with finances and weaponry, investment in the issue is unavoidable. What is the risk? According to Freeman, it's America's credibility. Follow Lauren on Twitter at twitter.com

From: Russia Today rt.com Published: 30 July, 2011, 21:51 Edited: 31 July, 2011, 11:05 Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in seven cities across Israel, and their social slogans are rapidly being replaced by the calls for the government to step down. The biggest rally is underway in Tel Aviv with around 150000 people having gathered at the "Tahrir Square of Israel." Police have arrested several activists who were blocking roads in the centre of Tel Aviv, calling for Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu to quit over government policies. This demonstration, which started with demands of affordable housing, food, healthcare and education, has taken the authorities by surprise by turning into a political one and they certainly do not know how to deal with it, RT's Paula Slier says. The calls for regime change and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down are heard on the square. "I'm here because it is just becoming impossible to live in this country anymore," says one of the protestors. "We work and we give, and we keep on giving, and there is no end to it." "I think there is a lot of influence of what happened on Tahrir Square, in Syria, Lebanon, what we see in Libya," says another. "People understand that they have the power and that they can organize themselves, they don't need anymore the government to tell them what to do. They can start telling the government what they want. They can start deciding for themselves." rt.com <b>...</b>

benjamin netanyahu 28 years old

Order: Reorder
Duration: 10:00
Published: 2011-05-22
Author: verfrakt


In a remarkable video from 1978, 28 year old MIT grad Benjamin Netanyahu debates whether there should be a Palestinian state created on the West Bank and Gaza. Netanyahu argues that such a state would have but one goal: to destroy the Jewish state of Israel. He reviews the history from 1948 to 1967, when Gaza was controlled by Egypt and the West Bank by Jordan and there were no calls to end the occupation, or for national sovereignty for the Palestinians. But one thing was similar in that period and today: terror attacks against Israeli Jews. Netanyahu went by the name of Benjamin Nitay at the time. His brother, Yonatan was an Israeli commando who led the Entebbe raid on July 4, 1976 during which he died. Netanyahu chose to use the name Nitay at MIT, where he was one year behind me, in large part for security reasons due to his brother's notoriety and the spate of Palestinian terror attacks aimed at Israelis all over the world.

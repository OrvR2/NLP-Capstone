TAX DEDUCTION FOR TIMBER LOSS DUE TO HURRICANE RITA









[ Print | 

 ]



East Texas timberland owners are eligible for claiming an income tax deduction (full report) on their 2005’s tax return for timber destroyed by Hurricane Rita.   The deduction falls under “casualty loss” in tax terms. 

Under the casualty loss tax laws, the amount of loss deduction is limited to the smaller of the decrease in fair market value of your timber and the adjusted basis in your timber.   If the adjusted basis is zero, your casualty loss deduction will be also zero.  The deduction is not the value of timber you lost caused by the storm under the current tax law. 
Furthermore, if you conduct a salvage sale, you will have a taxable gain when the sale proceeds exceed the adjusted gross income.  This is true even if the decrease in fair market value of your timber is smaller than the adjusted basis.  However, you may postpone taxes by investing in qualified replacement property such as reforestation and additional timberland purchases.  
If your casualty loss is more than your income, you have an operating loss that you can carry it forward or backward to your returns in earlier year or later year.
The appraisal fees are not part of the casualty loss.

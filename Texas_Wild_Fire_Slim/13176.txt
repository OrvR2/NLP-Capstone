According to local officials in Bastrop County Texas, the fire is swallowing "One home every four minutes". The fight has only begun. As of now, "zero percent" is contained. Words cannot describe how devastating these fires are to Austin and the surrounding areas. I'll simply let the images speak for themselves.










 The video footage was shot in and around Bastrop County. Please Contact the Central Texas Red Cross to help - americanredcross.org/​CentralTexasFaceBook

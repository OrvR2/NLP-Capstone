11.09.2001. Diese Menschen waren in ihrer Verzweiflung ganz alleine. So möchte doch niemand sterben.
Ach... @Freeze, was für ein Quatsch!!!
Hast Du keine Nachrichten gesehen an diesem Tag?
Seit nunmehr 10 Jahren denke ich am 11. September an all die Menschen, die gestorben sind und ganz besonders an die Angehörigen, die mit diesem Schicksalsschlag fertig werden müssen.

Billige Bildmanipulation in der Farbsättigung. Sonst wäre der Rauch braun und nicht grau und könnte schnell mit einer nuklearen Sprengung verglichen werden.

Government truthers are too stupid to realize that Popular Mechanics is an entertainment magazine. Those PM scum made money selling their story and lying to people. Now the Government truthers put on their foil hats and jerk off to PM in their moms basements.

Many Americans are content with the 9/11 Commission Report, but the two chairmen of the commission, Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton are not. Neither was commission member Max Cleland, a US Senator who resigned from the 9/11 Commission, telling the Boston Globe (November 13, 2003): "This investigation is now compromised." Even former FBI director Louis Freeh wrote in the Wall Street Journal (Nov. 17, 2005) that there are inaccuracies in the commission's report and "questions that need answers.

The reason I said that the picture of the man falling from the tower  is fake, is because #1,  The tower is still standing - not a scratch on it.  #2.  There is no one else falling, no papers flying everywhere, no fire, no smoke and #3. The man falling, his body is straight as an arrow except for his left leg being bent, not the way someone would be who had just jumped from a building like that, and he appeared to have a backpack on and something under his right arm.
Where there's fire, there's smoke.  No fire no smoke here though.  Unless he jumped BEFORE the plane hit the tower.

Live video evidence of a controlled demolition aside. we were told that the towers support beams were warped from the force of the planes and jet fuel; that is what allowed the pancake collapse. The construction of 1 & 2 had reinforced concrete slabs the size of several floors separating each half of the buildings. There would have been SOME resistance in a top heavy collapse. I can understand people walking the fence over the towers but BUILDING 7 was NOT HIT BY A PLANE and crumbled into its own footprint with NO RESISTANCE. This is not conspiracy "theory", It's documented and nobody is looking! You Tube "building 7" turn the sound of the nut talking about the new world order off and see for yourself people! There is no explanation.

I remember this very clearly...when the building collapsed it felt like my heart stopped. They just showed the firefighters and the police going in to make sure people are out. I just couldn't believe it. All those heroes...gone.

its amaing how some people are still so ignorant to facts off 9/11.some are calling it a "controlled demolition" at the twin towers by the government in some elaborate conspiracy theory...but they forget that their were 2 other planes. and the twin towers were the only civilian target..the rest were GOVERMENT targets like the pentagon and flight 93 that was on its way to the white house...why would they try to kill themselves..STUPID THEORY

The photographer did a very good job on capturing such powerful images. 
The ones of the people falling are the saddest, though. It really shows you how desperate they were. Having to decide between burning alive or falling to a death is horrible. I was only in 1st grade when it happened, but I knew that everything was eery that day. We must honor all of the brave men and women who helped that day, and who died.

Since when do buildings need to BLOW UP to collapse when their inner structure is weakened???  The bridge in Minnesota collapsed. It didnt BLOW UP..then collapse...did it??

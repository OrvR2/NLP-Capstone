Harper could be the most powerful political executive in the world: professorBy Andy Radia | Canada Politics – Thu, 8 Sep, 2011

Stephen Harper has been accused of having a "my way or the highway" attitude towards governing the country.
Now with a majority government, some would argue that attitude has been exclaimed.
This past week, the prime minister has flexed his proverbial political muscle once again with the introduction of a draconian terror law which will allow for police detention of suspects without charges for up to 72 hours and for judges to compel witnesses to testify at trial.
The laws were first introduced in 2001 following the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, but opposition parties blocked their renewal in 2007.
Now with a majority, Harper is free to push this legislation through. In fact, he's pretty much able to do what he wants - with very few obstacles.
Although it seems benign, Harper ordered all Canadian embassies to have a portrait of the Queen hung prominently. He makes no bones about being a staunch monarchist.
Ralph Heintzman, a professor at the University of Ottawa and head of the federal Office of Public Service Values and Ethics, says Canada might just have the most centralized political system in the world.
"The Canadian prime minister is probably the most powerful political executive in the world because there is nothing, once he has a majority in Parliament, to restrain him or her," he told the Winnipeg Free Press in a recent interview.
"In most other Westminster democracies, there are peculiarities of the system, which act as checks, formally or informally."
Heintzman cites parliamentary systems in the U.K. and Australia where the party leaders are chosen by MPs, as opposed to party members like in Canada.
"That turns the power relationship upside down," he says. "The leader controls the caucus. The caucus does not control the leader."
In other words, members of Parliament in Canada are inclined to vote the way the prime minister wants them to or risk losing opportunities to serve on cabinet or even in caucus.   In the U.K. and Australia, MPs yield more power over their leader.
Canada's prime minister even has more power here than the president does in the United States. The American head of state can find his or her agenda blocked by either or both houses of Congress as well as a politically activist Supreme Court.
But in Canada a prime minister with a majority government and an appointed, unaccountable Senate has no real obstacles to passing bills.
For the next four years at least, it might just be appropriate to call him King Harper.

We still have the Supreme Court. Many of King Harper's "draconian" new laws are clearly in violation of The Charter of Rights and Freedoms. That will be your last defense in Canada's new fight for your rights against the King.

We Canadians see a great person thinking about his Country folks and thinking about their safety first, now we need to have a few other items back in force or put back on the table, like when you take a life you lose yours, i am tired of these criminals getting educated on our bill, when we can't afford to give our own children a good education, something wrong there, but getting the Liberals out of power for good will be good for Canada, McGinty has to go people, wake up and boot him out.... He will give immagrants granst to study in Canada but does nothing for his own Canadian kids here, what a jack ass, his free ride is over and I for one have stopped lining his pockets in the last few elections, too bad more didn't feel this way too....

Scary thought that the country's biggest jackass is the most powerful leader in the world.  Canadians were foolish to vote him in so whatever he may or may not do it is our fault.  In a country full of immigrants, we gave the biggest bigot the top job.

That is pretty unnerving news.  I know the man is a control freak, now I find out he's a control freak with the power to exercise it...

Such scenario is unhealthy for a nation as it would eventually lead to dictatorial form of government. There would be complete absence of checks and balances since the Prime Minister has the majority control of the entire form of institution.

If harnessed, the amount of drama and whining generated by this page alone would power the average household for half an eternity.

I love how people cry about the government as if their sniveling would get anything done. Gives new meaning to the word 'powerless'. You want change? Do it yourself. Make your own political party. And then we'll see if you crybabies can do any better.

not true. Obama had his party majority in both chambers of Congress, which they used to reward and bail out their crony banksters and thugs with the taxpayers' future earnings. They had absolute, unbridled power for 2 years. Not so for Harper: the Tories do not have absolute majority of both chambers of our legislature.

What this asshole "Professor" fails to mention is the fact that it was his hero Trudeau who centralized the PMO and set the rules as such so he wouldn't have any opposition whatsoever when bringing in his insane policies.  His clone Chretien expanded on it so as to ensure he could dig the knife deeper into the back of Paul Martin.

That is only one tiny example of the leftist, socialist, bleeding heart, commie, pinko make me puke mentality in that if the beloved Fiberals do things such as this it is OK cause after all Fiberals are "Enlightened" whereas conservatives are all uneducated rednecks and evil doers.

Get a life you commie creeps and cut with the hypocrisy.

You've forgotten the that the seculars also have false idols of the worst kind. We bow to our car and truck, and big screen televisions, sex, rock and roll. but let's not forget the things that give us temporary joy., crack, cocaine other assorted Gods that love to destroy us.

By the choice of words and the tone of this "news" article, you can say this was written with a slant whose aim was to incite a lot of reaction. Well, i guess that this kind of "news" has been written may be called an expression of freedom of speech.... however, by the choice of words in the negative and hateful comments this article has provoked, it is obvious that many of us do not respect this freedom of speech....  Again, freedoms are bought with a price and the price is called RESPONSIBILITY, eh!

The article is misleading.  Having considerable power in Canada doesn't mean much of anything.  No one outside of Canada knows who this guy is.  If you don't believe me, ask your relatives abroad as to who the Prime Minister of Canada is without Googling.

I'm very proud of all the knowledgeable comments on 9/11. Harper government can crawl into their caves with all the other satanic worshipers.

It is a sign of the times that people who lack any kind of decorum or sane behavior would have a computer in their hands and be able to work it enough to get onto a news article comment column to be able to spew out name-calling of our PM, someone who is the leader of one the great nations of the world. What have these people accomplished in life or contributed to our country?

For those that have no idea what your talking about, please quit making your self look stupid. The efforts that have gone into this Memorial is way more than what you think. This Memorial has been well thought out, well planned, has been executed with most haste. These pictures don't do the Memorial any justice. The 2 water fountains are over 30 feet deep, with a tree garden with over 400 new trees. The tower is a marvel in itself. I may not have lost a person on 9/11, but a part of me went out to those that did. There is a special I do believe that will be on Discovery Channel about the new Memorial and the building of the Skyscaper. May those that lost loved ones find some closer with this new Memorial.

a well thought out memorial>? that is all america has become from the arlington cemetary to 911 or vietnam war memorial  or the delaware memorial bridge is a place of memorials.  right thinking would apply in not manufacturing the need for memorials.

It amazes...10 full years later and still no Freedom Tower. Sept 11, 2001 was a devastating day in America, but so was Pearl Harbor. Innocent people dying all in the name of hate. But rehashing it over and over doesn't really honor those who perished that day. They would want us to move on, not forget...but move on. Lets pay our respects at the memorials and fill the skyline with our Freedom Tower proving to the world that America is still strong and that we will not go down with a wimper and the lives that were taken that day were not in vain.

You're a Christian Hypocrite, this nation was not founded on Christains values and never has been because Thomas Jefferson was against religion, he even wrote a letter to his own son about it, and Jesus was hung on a medieval torture device by the Roman Army soldiers because he would not accept Julius Ceasar as his ruler and king. In other words he was murdered by the Roman Army. Jesus is not the only one to have gone through Crucifixion, the coastline was littered with hundreds of thousands of people's bodies that this ritual was imposed upon. Jump ahead 2000 years: George W.anker Bush should be put in prison for lying us into a false war about false intelligence that has drained our country of resources. It was called "The Project for A New American Century". Even Condoleeza Rice said Richard (Dick) Cheney lied in his memoir.

The hate that was shown for our country and what we stand for is overwhelming.  We founded our nation on Christain values and we need to return to them.  It is those values that lead me to the great grief I feel for the ones that were lost and their families

I think it is unfair that Chaz Bono is being critized for being on DWTS. More powr to him.

The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. The United States took American Japanese citizens and threw them in concentration camps, then after the war released them. Did we learn anything from that? No, of course not, not as a people. We are motivated much by fear and shouldn't forget the ideals that built this country no matter how hard it is sometimes.

SUPPRESSED DETAILS OF CRIMINAL INSIDER TRADING
LEAD DIRECTLY INTO THE CIA'S HIGHEST RANKS
CIA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR "BUZZY" KRONGARD
MANAGED FIRM THAT HANDLED "PUT" OPTIONS ON UAL
by Michael C. Ruppert

[© COPYRIGHT, 2001, Michael C. Ruppert and FTW Publications, www.copvcia.com. All Rights Reserved. May be reprinted or distributed for non-profit purposes only.]

FTW, October 9, 2001 - Although uniformly ignored by the mainstream U.S. media, there is abundant and clear evidence that a number of transactions in financial markets indicated specific (criminal) foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In the case of at least one of these trades -- which has left a $2.5 million prize unclaimed -- the firm used to place the "put options" on United Airlines stock was, until 1998, managed by the man who is now in the number three Executive Director position at the Central Intelligence Agency. Until 1997 A.B. "Buzzy" Krongard had been Chairman of the investment bank A.B. Brown. A.B. Brown was acquired by Banker's Trust in 1997. Krongard then became, as part of the merger, Vice Chairman of Banker's Trust-AB Brown, one of 20 major U.S. banks named by Senator Carl Levin this year as being connected to money laundering. Krongard's last position at Banker's Trust (BT) was to oversee "private client relations". In this capacity he had direct hands-on relations with some of the wealthiest people in the world in a kind of specialized banking operation that has been identified by the U.S. Senate and other investigators as being closely connected to the laundering of drug money.
Krongard (re?) joined the CIA in 1998 as counsel to CIA Director George Tenet. He was promoted to CIA Executive Director by President Bush in March of this year. BT was acquired by Deutsche Bank in 1999. The combined firm is the single largest bank in Europe. And, as we shall see, Deutsche Bank played several key roles in events connected to the September 11 attacks.
A September 21 story by the Israeli Herzliyya International Policy Institute for Counter terrorism, entitled "Black Tuesday: The World's Largest Insider Trading Scam?" documented the following trades connected to the September 11 attacks:
- Between September 6 and 7, the Chicago Board Options Exchange saw purchases of 4,744 put options on United Airlines, but only 396 call options. Assuming that 4,000 of the options were bought by people with advance knowledge of the imminent attacks, these "insiders" would have profited by almost $5 million.
- On September 10, 4,516 put options on American Airlines were bought on the Chicago exchange, compared to only 748 calls. Again, there was no news at that point to justify this imbalance; Again, assuming that 4,000 of these options trades represent "insiders", they would represent a gain of about $4 million.
- [The levels of put options purchased above were more than six times higher than normal.]
- No similar trading in other airlines occurred on the Chicago exchange in the days immediately preceding Black Tuesday.

The 9/11 memorial looks like a waste of space to me for something meaningless.  A slab of metal and perhaps names of those lost would be more meaningful.

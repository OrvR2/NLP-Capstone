From Inhabitat: 
If this is someone's plush toy, we're a bit worried about its owner coming back to get him after dropping him in this Swedish town square! As part of this summer's openART biennale in Orebro, Sweden, Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman built this giant, 13-meter-high yellow bunny using local materials and craftsmen. Located near St. Nicolai church in the city center, Stor Gul Kanin (Big Yellow Bunny) questions the purpose of the public space and changes the perspective of the monuments within.

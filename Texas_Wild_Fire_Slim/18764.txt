NASA’s Cassini orbiter snaps unbelievable picture of SaturnBy Mike Wehner, Tecca | Today in Tech – Thu, 8 Sep, 2011

Sometimes reality is just as stunning as science fiction
Science fiction movies have spoiled us on high definition views of our planetary neighbors, but real-life photographs with equal jaw-dropping potential are exceedingly rare. That's what makes NASA's awe-inspiring snapshot of Saturn (hi-res version here) such a stunning piece of eye candy.
Taken by NASA's Cassini robotic orbiter, the shot was captured from the dark side of Saturn as the Sun's bright rays illuminated every piece of dust and debris circling the planet. Cassini has offered astronomers a never-before-seen look at Saturn and revealed more information about the planet than any craft before it. The craft has taken so many pictures of the ringed wonder that they were recently made into a short flyby film that looks like it was created by George Lucas rather than a robotic space explorer.
The Cassini probe was launched in 1997 and took a further 7 years to reach Saturn's orbit. The total cost of its overarching objective of studying the ringed planet stands at a staggering $3.26 billion. However, the wealth of information it has wrought — including amazing pictures like the one above, and recordings of massive lightning storms on the planet — have already made it one of the best investments in space exploration. Hopefully Juno — which began a 5-year trek to Jupiter just last month — will bring us some equally stunning shots of Saturn's neighbor.

What's attached to it, a disposable camera? That's got to be the worst resolution shot I've ever seen.Try a little zoom.. Ohh wait, nahh that's pretty impressive for the millions of dollars they invest into building those things. I'm so impressed with the immaculate quality.  then again, didnt NASA just shut down.

Ok, it is a stunning picture, BUT what is the "circle" around the planet and/or why does it appear that the lower half of the planet is outside the rings.  Also, there is discontinuity of the rings in the center.  It looks like I am seeing it under a magnifying glass.

wow wee! it does look really cool! 
and just to add after read the below comments ( which tickled me, thanks for the entertainment LOL) I am a Christian ( which is what the Pharasies named us, which means follows of Christ), I do believe in the trinity, i do and know there is a God (who also goes by many bibical names) who did create the planets and the earth. I also know He does not need defending... and before you go off about believing in this or that, prove this or that.. I will end on this truthful note. Even the devil believes in God. Prove it? prove he doesn't...

Sara what really makes people mad is the religious comments on a science article. Wrong place to try to sell your religion and especially the wrong place to sell the failed myth of creation.

3.26 BILLION?  BILLION?  to study a RINGED PLANET?  and there are homeless people? and people knocking at my door for bucks for research?  Obviously screwed up priorities.

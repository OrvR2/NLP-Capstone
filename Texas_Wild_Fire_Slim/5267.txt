Journalists trapped in Tripoli’s Rixos hotel are freedBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – Wed, Aug 24, 2011

Journalists inside Tripoli's Rixos hotel. (Reuters)
Dozens of journalists that were trapped inside the Rixos Al Nasr Hotel in Tripoli for five days have been allowed to leave.
"It's been an absolute nightmare for all of us," CNN senior international correspondent Matthew Chance--one of the trapped journalists--said on air Wednesday. "I can't tell you how relieved we all are."
All of the journalists were allowed to leave on Wednesday, Chance said, and were escorted in four Red Cross vehicles to another hotel at an undisclosed location. No one was injured, he said. "Perhaps some emotional scars, but other than that, nothing," he said. "It's a huge, huge relief."
The journalists--from CNN, Fox News, Reuters and other outlets--had been held inside by armed forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi, and the $400-a-night Rixos had become something of a five-star "prison" for journalists.
Even if they were allowed to leave, the New York Times noted, "a raging gun battle outside would probably prevent them from getting very far."

Chance told Anderson Cooper on Tuesday that while, at first, they might have felt mildly relieved to be sheltered from the gunfire outside, they are "not happy being here anymore."
Chance described the situation inside the hotel as "grim."
The journalists--roughly 35 in number--had taken a floor in the hotel, dressed in body armor and bulletproof vests as some windows had been shot out with bullets.
"We're very anxious about what might happen in this hotel in the hours ahead," Chance said.
"There is no power and no running water," the Associated Press' Dario Lopez-Mills wrote. "On Monday we ate bread and butter. On Tuesday, the cook made french fries. Bottled water is running low. We don't know when it's going to end." Fox News' Tadek Markowski described a similar scene. "[It was] the hotel from hell," Markowski said.
On Wednesday, Chance reported via Twitter that five journalists tried to enter the hotel, but were turned away by Gadhafi forces at gunpoint.
"All puzzled as to why we are being kept in #rixos," Chance wrote. "Any ideas?"
On Tuesday, Chance told Cooper, "We feel that they feel that we're valuable."
Reuters released a series of photographs of the journalists inside Rixos in varying degrees of fear and boredom.
Jomana Karadsheh, a CNN producer who was also trapped inside Rixos, said she had been negotiating with the guards for their release, telling one of them about wanting to see her family.
"He got tears in his eyes at that moment," Karadsheh said. "Slowly myself and another colleague here, an Arab camera man, sat there with him and said things are changing out there ... just let us go."
Meanwhile, Karadsheh and Chance's CNN colleague Sara Sidner--who was not one of the trapped journalists--has been delivering on-air reports amid waves of loud, celebratory gunfire that is nonetheless less unnerving.
"These bullets have to come down somewhere," she said on Wednesday.
"We had no idea Tripoli was like this," the BBC's Matthew Price, another one of the trapped journalists, said.

poor guys looks like nthey had it pretty rough, reminds me of those south american miners who were trapped underground for like three month's.  I just hope that the reports were'nt compelled to have sex with one another during their ordeal. Maybe now they will be more simpathetic toward us prisoners here in the joint.

I remember when journalists were MEN, not these pantywaist wussies who talk about "emotional scars" after merely being held in a hotel, yes a HOTEL, for a very short time. It goes hand in glove with the wussification of all Americans. Everybody's a victim, everybody's suffered "abuse," and now there are a dozen different flavors of "abuse" where drama queens can parade around their victim status. Thanks liberals and leftists for turning American men into an utter disgrace of whiny girls. A real man would be saying "Being held in this hotel was no big deal because it was a hotel for ___sakes, and it wasn't very long, and it was totally expected since we were in the middle of a ___ing WAR ZONE!" But instead we're reading a news story that mentions their "emotional scars." Good grief. How wussified will men be in 20 years? Part of the wussification and coward creation of American males is how the "tough" ones all want to be soldiers and cops. Nothing is LESS manly than these overbearing modern cops who travel in gangs, who hide behind their badges and massive resources (resources that aren't even THEIRS, which the taxpayer paid for at gunpoint). Modern cops don't possess reason or humanity. They always admit that "the training took over." A real man possesses REASON and doesn't hide behind "policy" or "the training" to explain his actions. Modern cops strut around with machine guns for the most harmless "standoffs" so they can feel tough. They come out in their "SWAT" gangs for EVERYTHING, no matter how harmless, so they can feel tough and super "manly" strutting around with machine guns when there is no threat (very UNmanly behavior). They bash into people's homes in pre dawn raids, in ultra cowardly fashion because it's frequently over A PLANT. Real men possess a sense of right and wrong instead of just mindlessly following government like these enforcers do. Modern cops slick their heads like warriors and strut around in sunglasses on an overcast day so they can appear tough and manly. Many of them are ex military, which goes along with the evil militarization of our PEACE OFFICERS (they aren't peace officers anymore, they are cowards who see themselves as warriors and the citizen as the enemy).

There are no heroics, no trials-by-fire in this "news item", just self-aggrandizement among a covey of journalists cocooned in body armor, flak vests and kevlar helmets holed up in a four-star hotel; their situation could barely but charitably described as "deprived" (bread and water, then french fries no less) as they milled about exchanging looks of fear and worry. 

Beekeepers face greater danger than these 35 did.

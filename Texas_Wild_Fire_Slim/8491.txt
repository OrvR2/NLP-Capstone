Man refused bail over Australia 'bomb' siegeAFP – Wed, Sep 7, 2011

A man who allegedly threatened to detonate a bomb during an 11-hour Sydney siege was refused bail, as police admitted that storming an office building to arrest him was a "big risk".
The 52-year-old, who cannot be named, has been charged over the bomb hoax after the lengthy stand-off forced parts of a Sydney district into lockdown and prompted the evacuation of workers.
He did not appear at the hearing at the Parramatta court across the road from Tuesday's siege, and was formally refused bail and remanded in custody.
The man allegedly threatened to detonate a bomb in his backpack after barricading himself and his 12-year-old daughter in a law firm office.
He was arrested when police stormed the building after 11 hours of negotiations failed. The girl was unharmed and police later determined the man had not been carrying explosives.
Assistant Police Commissioner Denis Clifford admitted the operation was risky.
"It was done very swiftly, precisely, and she was extracted from there in a matter of a few seconds," he said of the girl.
"It was certainly a big risk and we're going to praise the courage of the officers who broke into the confined space, that barricaded space, believing that that person had a bomb."
The incident was the second in as many months in which Sydney has been hit by an explosives scare, with teenager Madeleine Pulver making worldwide headlines in August after finding herself at the centre of a collar bomb hoax.
A man was arrested in the United States over the incident but charges are yet to be laid.

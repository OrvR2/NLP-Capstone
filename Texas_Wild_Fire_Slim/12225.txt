Aug. 23, 2011 – LINDEN, Texas – Wildfire activity is on the rise in Northeast Texas as the state continues to experience critical drought conditions. As of Aug. 18, Texas Forest Service crews in the northeast part of the state have responded to 631 fires that have burned 9,705 acres. Throughout the entire 2010 calendar year, 358 fires occurred in the same region, burning 4,598 acres.Although numerous fires in the past several weeks have been started by lightning striking extremely dry fuels, others have started accidentally by hay-baling equipment, welding and catalytic converters. Extra caution is advised when using heat-producing equipment, especially in areas with tall grass. Welders are cautioned to use a spotter and have a fire extinguisher nearby.Although burn bans are in place in every county in Northeast Texas, the number of wildfires resulting from outdoor burning has increased recently. In addition to criminal charges, those responsible for escaped fires also are subject to civil liability. Current conditions are so dry that a single spark can create a dangerous wildfire. In recent weeks, several counties in Northeast Texas have experienced wildfires resulting from arson. Texas Forest Service law enforcement investigates all fires of a suspicious cause. Citizens who witness or suspect arson activity are encouraged to call 1-800-364-3740. Contacts:Lee McNeely, Public Information Officer(903) 756-5571, lmcneely@tfs.tamu.edu April Saginor, Communications Specialist(979) 458-6619, asaginor@tfs.tamu.edu

Daily Horoscope for September 13

 Capricorn
Your home and family may be on your mind as the nurturing Moon enters your fourth house. Past conditioning from your childhood may be making itself felt now, but you should be able to recognize whether or not these behaviors are productive. Pat yourself on the back for the positive way you respond to the present, but take a time out for inappropriate, knee-jerk reactions.

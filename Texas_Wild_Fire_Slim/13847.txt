This historic Texas wildfire season has shattered all previous records

The wildfires that plagued Texas this spring are back, in a big way. Most recently an ongoing massive wildfire in Central Texas, fanned by winds from distant Tropical Storm Lee,  has burned more than 1,000 homes.
This year’s wildfires have, unfortunately, truly been historic.

Check out this data from the Texas Forest Service, which was compiled before the outbreak over the weekend:

Six of the 10 largest wildfires in Texas history occurred in 2011.
Fires in Texas in 2011: 18,612
Acres burned in Texas in 2011: 3,486,124
Texas counties with burn bans: 251 of 254
Total Aviation Hours: 13,216
Gallons of water dropped: 20,555,281

That’s not all. Since Nov. 15 more than 3.5 million acres have burned in Texas, breaking the all-time record of 2.1 million acres for the same period set back in 2005-2006.
I take that back. This year’s wildfire season has annihilated the previous records. “Break” isn’t nearly strong enough.
In short, it’s a terrible year for fires, and with little relief in sight expect the disastrous trend to continue.

Would that they had extinguished them as well…

The Lege cutting funding to volunteer fire departments did not help.

The drought caused the fires, not the legislature.

Don’t see a mention of the Lege causing the fires. Controlling them though requires resources beyond a rugged individual’s means.

That’s 2% of the total land area of Texas.  And the fires are still burning.
Eric, your reference to Dust Bowl might be all too prescient.

I know it’s early, but any chance that new system just off the Mexican coast could travel North and give us relief ?

Very unlikely. High pressure will probably steer it into Mexico or toward the northern Gulf coast.

Eric, i am a native of S. Central Texas, And it is now a powder keg. There is vast amounts of dry needle grass, oily juniper and ceder trees, and vast amounts of thick mesquite and extremely dry underbrush.

It is just brutal, I agree. Alas relief may be a long time in coming.

That is some photo of the fire creeping up on that house. What a shame.

uhh.. HELLO??? Wasn’t it Perry and his republicon ilk who slashed school funding, jobs and aid to the infirm and poor in favor of leaving billions in the rainy day fund for use in mitigating natural disaster damage? Any repugs or Perry calling to release those funds for this “epoch” disaster? THE SILENCE IS DEAFENING!

He wouldn’t want to spoil his record as a patriotic fiscal conservative. Besides maybe FEMA will bail us out and he can keep carping about how big and bad federal Government is.

Eric, is it too early to pin a cause on most of these wildfires? We know the historic drought is a major contributor to these fires. But someone — or something — has to light the fuse. Are these fires started by people (intentionally or not) or by nature (lightning)?  Any thoughts?

A number of these fires are zero contained right now. It’s a bit early to be doing forensics. With so many fires over such a wide area the answer will probably turn out to be all of the above. One thing for sure with so much dry tinder across the state anyone looking for some attention can unfortuanately get it all to easily right now if you know what I mean.

I thought Lee would bring a little rain – all we got was firestorms.

Eric, you’ve been quoted on The Atlantic website, and linked to.

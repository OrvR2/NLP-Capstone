Nyjer Morgan tosses tobacco at Carpenter, calls Pujols a ‘she’ By      David Brown




Despite being entertaining and talented, Nyjer Morgan(notes) plays baseball like a hockey player who takes dumb penalties. With the Milwaukee Brewers on the cusp of the playoffs, it's easy to see how this might play out in the NLDS.
Exactly how it did Wednesday night in St. Louis.
Someone is going to take a cue from Chris Carpenter and the St. Louis Cardinals and antagonize Morgan into losing his cool, and it will hurt the Brewers when the margin for error is smallest.
Morgan apparently got angry over being sworn at in the ninth by Carpenter (though Carpenter vaguely denied saying anything). So, Morgan yelled obscenities back — and also chucked the wad of tobacco he had been chewing in Carpenter's general direction. Albert Pujols(notes) saw it go down from his position at first base and came running in, dramatically, not unlike Gaby Sanchez(notes) did during the Marlins' big fracas with Morgan a season ago.
Only, Pujols pulled up and didn't clothesline anyone. But benches briefly cleared and Nyjer had to be restrained by teammates.
Watch for children
It was like a scene Vince McMahon might have written for pro wrestling, or if Terry Gilliam directed a movie about Muhammad Ali.
After tossing the chaw, Morgan got tossed from the game by umpires and the Cardinals won, 2-0, with Carpenter finishing them off with a four-hitter.
Later, on Twitter — one of Nyjer's favorite Tony Plush hangouts — he was still chatting:
Alberta couldn't see Plush if she had her gloves on!!! Wat was she thinking running afta Plush!!! She never been n tha ring!!!
By referring to "Alberta," was Morgan referring to his pro hockey roots in Canada? No, he was making an unfunny joke about "Albert" Pujols lacking masculine qualities.
UPDATE: The Brewers plan on disciplining Morgan.



If screaming at people unnecessarily isn't going over the line, and if throwing your disgusting tobacco at them isn't going over the line, then calling a man "she" and "her" — as if female equals weak — certainly is. (At least he didn't play the gay card.)


Although he's not the best player on the team, Morgan has been an important reason they're in first place. He has a 116 adjusted OPS, fifth-best in a good lineup. He certainly brings a spark to the mundane day-to-day baseball life. He's darn funny at times, if nonsensical. He also can play baseball, and even the Cardinals — even Tony La Russa and Carpenter — said as much after the game. Pujols even said he liked Morgan.


But he won't help the Brewers by getting run from a playoff game, or suspended from one, or inciting a brawl in one. Morgan has to be the most obvious Achilles' heal in the playoffs.
Can he stay out of the penalty box?

0 users disliked this comment DT 4 hours ago Report Abuse I just don't get why it's always Nyjer's fault.   Am I missing something here?   Sure, Nyjer has a mouth.   I get that.   But so does Carps.   I'm a Cardinals fan, Carpenter is usually the antagonist and instigator.   He cussed Nyjer out, Nyjer cussed back.   The chucking of his chew toward the mound is NOTHING.   The story should be about how Albert Pujols came unglued and chased after Nyjer spouting off at the mouth.   He should have stayed out of it, or at least settled Carp down.   What's been going on between Nyjer & Carp has been going on for a while.   We all know Carp started this and is playing Mr. Innocent.   That's how he works...he knows it will get under your skin.   It's not like Nyjer went all Yadier Molina on Carp just for saying Hi to him.   He had a pretty good excuse for talking back.   A better excuse when Pujols charged.

1 users disliked this comment fred 9 hours ago Report Abuse So today Carpenter admitted swearing at Morgan, saying "f--- you" after the strike out. This after he lied about it for two days.
For this Morgan threw his chew. Big deal. Frankly anyone who thinks you can hit someone with a chew from sixty feet is crazy.
Pujols    is the one who stirred things up, came running across the field with the usual Cardinals @#$%, yet nobody writes a story about his "attitude".
Will Pujols confront Carpenter for lying, or is that just the "Cardinal way"?

0 users disliked this comment teddybearmiller 11 hours ago Report Abuse High Testosterone plus Steroids plus Arrogance plus a multi million dollars salary equals what? Hot headed, rude and ignorant sports jocks (Jerks). Their habits are disgusting and their arrogance nauseating. And these are the athletes that children try to mimic and worship as sports heroes. Overpaid Jackasses is more like the term to describe many of them. There are exceptions in the sports world but it seems that the High-strung Jerks get noticed and the nice guys are left in the trenches.

0 users disliked this comment Tim 13 hours ago Report Abuse Hahaha, how predictable, all you need to do is read the title from yahoo's home page, think of something dirty baseball players can throw and VOILA, you've got a pissed off batter throwing a nice chaw (chewing tobacco) at the the pitcher

In all seriousness though, that wasn't a classy move and I hope, for his sake that he apologizes. He may have been insulted but it would have been better for himself and the team that he decided that rather than getting even, he'd get better and pop a base hit. That would have trumped any insult and he could have gloated for as long as he wanted after.

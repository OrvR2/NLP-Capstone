Coppola Making a Movie With Charlie Sheen. No, Not That Coppola. No, Not That One Either.By Will LeitchEditorPostsEmailRSSBy Will Leitch | The Projector – Thu, Sep 8, 2011 5:50 PM EDT

Tom Briglia/WireImage.comOne of the nice things about Charlie Sheen not having starred in a movie in seven years -- 2004's "The Big Bounce," which gave Americans the opportunity to at last see Sheen and Morgan Freeman work together -- is that we don't have to write about him. No offense to the guy: He's clearly doing well for himself and is stable and well-adjusted and has made sound and logical decisions that have led him to be respected and admired and surely on the boards of several distinguished charitable organizations. We bid him no ill tidings. But he also hasn't been a movie actor in so long that he has remained blissfully off our radar. Maybe if this were a theater site.

So: Darnit. Sheen just signed to be in a movie. (It's his first gig since being fired from "Two and a Half Men.") We can't hide anymore. Sheen, having long passed the point where he can play any character other than himself, will play "Charlie Swan" in ""A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charlie Swan III." It's an indie that'll co-star Jason Schwartzman -- an actor we tire of, for reasons best explained by HitFix's Alan Sepinwall -- and be directed by Roman Coppola, a.k.a., The Coppola Who Does Music Videos And Hangs Out With Spike Jonze But Never Dated Spike Jonze And Also Does Not Have A Vineyard. Here's the plot description:
In a plotline that intersects with some of Sheen's real-life  travails, "Glimpse" follows a successful graphic designer whose fame,  money and charm have made him irresistible to women. But when his  girlfriend breaks up with him his life heads into a downward spiral.
We're pretty certain the Coppola/Schwartzman/Wes Anderson/Spike Jonze is just gonna make fun of him, right? By the way, good luck getting insurance on this one, boys.

So, who thinks his character was originally named something else, but they had to change it to Charlie to avoid a lot of unusable footage of Sheen looking befuddled and saying "You talking to me?"

"Get Samples 123" is promoting a new line of detergent, tooth paste, lotion etc by giving away free samples. It’s more of the “try it before buy it” marketing model and who can resist a free useful household product like detergent?  This free sample is limited to one per household and only available while supplies last.

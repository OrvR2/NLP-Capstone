Next up: a sleight of hand


Posted: Thu, 12 May 2011 18:47:09 MDT
Immigration reform, huh? Well, President Obama did recently consult with Eva Longoria on this formidable policy conundrum. As goes Longoria, so goes the nation.
    




When can we call it terror?


Posted: Thu, 24 Mar 2011 18:51:09 MDT
What does a guy have to do to be called a terrorist these days?
    




David Harsanyi: A war we don't need


Posted: Tue, 22 Mar 2011 18:12:20 MDT
Contrary to pithy bumper-sticker truisms, war is occasionally the answer. But can anyone explain why it's the answer now? At the moment, at least, polls insist that Americans are generally supportive of the United States intervening in the civil war now raging in Libya, so someone must have an iron-clad case.
    




Rural communities would be hardest hit by PBS funding cut


Posted: Thu, 10 Mar 2011 19:09:22 MST
Thank you for David Harsanyi's thoughtful column highlighting the strengths and challenges of public media. I welcome a discussion about federal funding for public broadcasting.
    




Why can't we talk about radicalism?


Posted: Thu, 10 Mar 2011 19:07:00 MST
As reckless as it is to make sweeping statements about Islam — and it is reckless — isn't it equally irresponsible to claim there is prejudice where it doesn't exist? Because that's where we are in this debate surrounding Rep. Peter King's infamous investigation into domestic Muslim radicalization.
    




David Harsanyi: The Elmo vendetta


Posted: Tue, 8 Mar 2011 17:59:40 MST
Looks like we're finally going to get those hipsters at National Public Radio. Elmo should probably start thinking twice before going outside, as well.
    




Donald Trump: His time is now


Posted: Thu, 3 Mar 2011 19:05:04 MST
Our nation, fractured and beleaguered, can finally embrace a moment of consensus. From Tea Party to union activists to undecided moderates, we must demand Donald Trump run for president.
    




David Harsanyi: There's plenty to cut


Posted: Wed, 2 Mar 2011 16:33:11 MST
Did you know that the federal government — the folks who brought you $1.6 trillion yearly deficits, $14 trillion in debt and make Elmo a reality — also offers Americans 56 separate programs to help them better understand their finances?
    




Harsanyi: Paul Krugman's Third World fantasy


Posted: Thu, 24 Feb 2011 19:07:15 MST
According to Nobel laureate and raconteur Paul Krugman, Gov. Scott Walker and "his backers" are attempting to "make Wisconsin — and eventually, America — less of a functioning democracy and more of a Third World-style oligarchy."
    




Harsanyi: An assault on taxpayers


Posted: Thu, 17 Feb 2011 22:29:26 MST
When Dan Nerad, the superintendent of Madison, Wis., schools, was informed that 40 percent of the teachers union was calling in sick this week (evidently something's going around), he shut down the entire operation.
    




David Harsanyi: Democracy isn't enough


Posted: Tue, 15 Feb 2011 21:18:06 MST
Though one hates to nitpick, it seems that Middle East coverage on cable TV has been only almost perfect. You see, for some reason, a number of anchors and talking heads have made a careless habit of using the words "democracy" and "freedom" as if they were interchangeable ideas.
    




The Patriot overreact


Posted: Thu, 10 Feb 2011 20:10:35 MST
This week, the House failed to pass a one-year reauthorization of three provisions of the Patriot Act even though the Republican leadership tried fast-tracking the effort without allowing the traditional airing of grievances.
    




David Harsanyi: Cronyism isn't capitalism


Posted: Tue, 8 Feb 2011 19:45:50 MST
When will you wingnuts stop referring to our economic restructuring as "socialism"? Winning the 21st century is all about business.
    




David Harsanyi: The right kind of activism


Posted: Tue, 1 Feb 2011 18:01:23 MST
For discussion's sake, let's just concede that every four years or so the American public is fooled into voting for a demagogue who's mastered a pleasant-sounding, market-tested populism.
    




Who are we in "Sputnik moment"?


Posted: Thu, 27 Jan 2011 19:55:36 MST
One of the difficulties progressives face is trying to make centralized planning sound like a good idea. Even the president, with all his rhetorical genius and majestic vagueness, can struggle with the task. So, from time to time, it's important to mold history a bit to, you know, make a point.

Gunman attacks seven people in three states, then kills selfBy Steven Allen Adams | Reuters – 9 hrs ago






MORGANTOWN, W.Va (Reuters) - A West Virginia man on a tri-state killing spree gunned down six people and ran over a seventh with his car before committing suicide, police said on Wednesday.
Five of the seven attacked have died, police said, and the alleged shooter, Shayne Riggleman, 22, of Morgantown, shot and killed himself after getting pulled over by police in Kentucky.
West Virginia State Police said the bloody trail began in Morgantown on Monday, when they were called to a home and found five bodies with lethal shotgun wounds.
They said Riggleman, driving a vehicle stolen from one of the victims, then traveled to Fairchance, Pennsylvania, to meet a female friend.
On Pennsylvania's Interstate 79, Riggleman struck another car and ran over the elderly driver as she exited her vehicle, critically wounding her. The victim's name has not been released.
Riggleman drove back into West Virginia and then stopped to get gas on I-79 in Roane County, 139 miles outside Morgantown. He shot the station attendant, Donald Nichols, who was now in critical condition, police said.
Riggleman got back on the road, entering Kentucky, and the Lewis County Sheriffs Department attempted to pull over his car. After a short pursuit, Riggleman stopped the car and shot himself, police said.
Authorities identified the dead as Charles Richardson, III, 49; wife Karin Richardson, 50; their two children, Katrina Hudson, 22, and Kevin Hudson, 17; and Robert Raber, Jr., of Wetzel County, W.Va.

Such acts of heinous behavior like this are going to increase in the future.  Send a letter of thanks to your present / past government officials for contributing to the destruction of the American Dream.  Allowing rich, fat cats to steal homes and taxpayer money, without concern for how parents without jobs are going to feed or provide basic living essentials to their starving children.  All this happening while your "under-paid" elected officials enjoy golf on one of their monthly family vacations.

But it just doesn't matter.  Hell, I'm all for population control.

To those of you reading this story who are suicidal/homicidal (and you are a guaranteed readership for this kind of story), please consider just killing yourself...and leaving the innocents among us alone.  If you MUST to go out in a blaze of glory, consider the guy who decapitated himself recently by tieing a wire around his neck attached to a tree and then driving away real, real fast. Sliced his head clean off.  And nobody else got hurt.  Just a thought for you. Thanks in advance.

I'm always amazed to hear otherwise intelligent people posting things like "something has to be done to make sure this never happens again" – as if that were possible!  As long as you've got humans, you're going to have crazies and killers and ways to do what they want to their victims.  It's just like the green "save the planet" people – that's not possible either.  All you can do is live your life and take your chances, and if they get you they get you.banning inanimate objects won't work, or else there'd be no drugs.  And passing laws doesn't stop crime, or else there'd be no crime, child abuse, things like that.

The hate projected by white people toward Hispanics brought this on! The hate toward blacks resulted in lynchings. White people should return to Europe, but they don't like you either.

Hopelessness depression and anger. It seems to be spreading. When someone goes into that dark place it is sometimes difficult to identify with people as having feelings and loved ones and allthat makes you a human being too. It can blind you. What seperates those of us who also have walked through that dark night of the soul and not acted out like this? Maybe someone being kind to us at the right place and time, no matter how small the gesture. Maybe not succombing to others who would feed that darkness further.  Maybe "grace". When I read about a man or woman doing something like this to others and to themselves I think: "There but for that grace go I."

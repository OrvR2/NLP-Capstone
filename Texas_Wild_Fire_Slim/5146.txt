The temperature isn't the only thing that heats up in Tinseltown during the summer months -- from summer flings to the real deal, we're looking back at this summer's hottest celebrity hookups. 
From Hollywood royalty spawn and a 'Glee' kid making us all say 'aww' to a "Monster" calling a "Green Lantern" beau, this summer's new celebrity couples were nothing short of smoldering. Forget playing coy, we've caught you hand-in-hand strolling on the sand or grabbing a quick bite to eat so we expect to see these pretty pairs in all of their relationship glory on the red carpet this fall.

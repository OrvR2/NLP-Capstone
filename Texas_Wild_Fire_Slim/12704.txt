Opinions divided over Bush's no-show at ground zero



 



Washington (CNN) - When President Barack Obama lays a wreath at the 9/11 Memorial on Thursday, he had hoped to be joined by former President George W. Bush. But in declining this invitation, Bush has left some observers puzzled, while others were supportive of his decision.
Conservative columnist Michelle Malkin says it's odd that Bush, who made it his mission to hunt down Osama bin Laden, will not appear alongside Obama. The trip to New York comes just days after the president announced bin Laden's death by U.S. forces in Pakistan.

By not attending the wreath laying ceremony, Bush is showing a maturity most of his GOPerville minions will never understand.  I applaud him for his decision.

The Day of Financial Reckoning is HERE - The Great Democrat Welfare Society Ends
Why in God's green earth would Bush get within a mile of Obama?  So he can be personally attacked in person, like Paul Ryan or the Supreme Court justices?  Obama has spent a huge amount of the last 3 years spewing hateful lies and vitriol about George Bush and Dick Cheney.  Attack after attack about policies which Obama has kept and is now benefitting from without acknowledging his predecessor.  Obama and his supporters have gone WAY OVER the line so they should not expect anything from George Bush.  And maybe George Bush thinks this is a cheap publicity stunt by Obama and doesn't want to be a part of it?

'Who knows if heâs hiding in some cave or not. We havenât heard from him in a long time. The idea of focusing on one person really indicates to me people donât understand the scope of the mission. Terror is bigger than one person. Heâs just a person whoâs been marginalized. â¦ I donât know where he is. I really just donât spend that much time on him, to be honest with you.' George Bush

	May 4, 2011 04:38 pm at 4:38 pm | 





The Situation
It's not odd since Bush and his administration didn't give a damm about getting OBL! All Bush was is all talk. He said how he was going to smoke OBL out of his cave and bring him to justice, like he is some US Marshall or Chuck Norris in Texas Walker Ranger. It bring him shame tht he claim he didn't worry about Bin Laden, while when Obama said from day one he will bring OBL to justice and "Yes He Did"

	May 4, 2011 04:39 pm at 4:39 pm | 





Robert
Really sounds like a man who made it his mission. Michelle Malkin is a fool and a liar.

	May 4, 2011 04:40 pm at 4:40 pm | 





GI Joe
Malkin needs to review some of Shrub's speeches/briefings.  He said AT LEAST TWICE that Bin Laden was NOT IMPORTANT to him  He was, after all, going after the man "that tried to kill my daddy".
Conservatives never let the facts get in the way of a juicy piece of gossip to bring our country to it's knees.  Why do they hate us so much?  Our taxes pay the corporations that give them campaign financing.

	May 4, 2011 04:56 pm at 4:56 pm | 





RKT
When you leave office, or any executive role, you leave. After that, there are protocols to follow.  The current exec (Obama) offers to share the stage, the former exec (Bush) respectfully declines.  Then the current exec (Obama) acknowledges the role of the former exec (Bush) in successes that had origins in the former's (Bush's) administration. By doing so, the current exec (Obama) establishes continuity for the organization, in this case the US government.  As most successes cut across administrations, whether in government or private industry, acknowledging the efforts of one's predecessor allows people who have stayed the course through both administrations to share the credit.

	May 4, 2011 04:58 pm at 4:58 pm | 





Paul ny
Because Bush knows he failed and he does not want to be there by the man who got the terrorist he let get away.

Michelle Malkin  âit's odd that Bush, who made it his mission to hunt down Osama bin Ladenâ yes that is true  after we invade the Iraq Bush didnât care  
G.W.Bush  own words âI donât spend much time  on that  truly I am not concern about Bin Ladenâ
So Michelle Malkin   give a credit to Obama

Thank God I am a Democrat
It was classy for Obama to extend the invitation. It was classy for Bush to decline. Bush had his moment right after 9/11 when he united all of us together. This is now Obama's moment when we should once again unite together. However I am not getting the same sense of unity from the right that we did when their guy was in office. I think allowing party affiliations to get in the way of this moment is a huge mistake. You repubs are so concerned to have Obama potentially get a single thumbs up for something that you are willing to not properly unite for this occasion with your fellow citizen who may not be a conservative like you. I hope to be proven wrong tomorrow.

S. In California - Obama 2012
I saw the video tape last night for the first time on MSNBC's The Last Word.  Bush is ABSOLUTELY RIGHT NOT TO SHOW UP.  He was disgusting standing there laughing and making sarcastic remarks when our men and women were out there dying.  He was completely classless and I'm sure even he is smart enough to realize it was in BAD taste to act in such a irresponsible form when discussing the subject of OBL.  Thank you former president for STAYING HOME.
As for President Obama's decision NOT to show the pictures of OBL – IT IS THE RIGHT DECISION.  Never have I been so proud of him.  In less than one week he has made two very difficult decisions.  We as Americans are supposed to represent ALL that is right and human in society.  By showing these pictures we aren't any better than the same pack of animals who laughed and cheered at hangings.  People who are demanding them listen to yourselves.  You sound like the Romans when they cheered lions tearing the heads off innocent children.  Personally, I am so very thankful to have a president who actually "thinks" before he acts.  For those who don't believe.  Keep watching for OBL to send you a videotape.  Maybe in a year or two – you will have calmed down and realized HE DID THE RIGHT THING afterall.  Pack these photos away just as the Lincoln funerals were packed away and America – LET'S MOVE ON.

Mo
Who gives a rip.  We got the mass murderer and everyone in the country is happy.  I am pleased with Obama which is a first but any more stomping on Bush when he is gone is not gong to help you Democrats.  Let this be a time like after 911 – let it rest.  All is good.

	May 4, 2011 05:16 pm at 5:16 pm | 





Inmyopinion
Hypocrites. The same people that were against us fighting terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan, against Bush invading Iraq to get rid of a murderer, demanding Bush face trial as well as Cheney, against Guantanamo,  these are the same people now cheering Obama for trespassing, breaking into Pakistan to kill Osama Bin Laden. How is Obama's action better than Bush's actions? depends which political party you belong to.  Why would Bush want to stand with all these hypocrites in a place where so many died in the hands of terrorists?  
Wait, we don't call them terrorists anymore, I think Napolitano calls them men who do bad things?

Who wants to see the man who sent our troops to Afghanistan to find bin laden and bring him back dead or alive to then desert them to go finish his daddy's war in iraq for wmd that he knew was a lie.
We had enough of this idiot.  Eight very long years.

	May 4, 2011 05:39 pm at 5:39 pm |

No matter what Obama does the idiots from the right will always complain. I think it was decent to invite Bush.....

	May 4, 2011 05:45 pm at 5:45 pm |

Bush wants to stay out of the spotlight. That's why he went on a nationwide tour to sell his book...

	May 4, 2011 05:46 pm at 5:46 pm | 





Nick
Bush said he DIDN'T CARE ABOUT BIN LADEN.

	May 4, 2011 05:49 pm at 5:49 pm | 





Inmyopinion
It was Bush who went after Bin Laden and has been critized for more than 8 years for having our soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, Obama did not start the hunt for Bin Laden, Obama only finished what was already in the works for many years by the previous administration which is why he has to give credit to Bush, like it or not. Obama is smart enough to recognize these was already in the works way before he took the White House.

Dominican mama 4 Obama
It would be nice to display our solidarity to the world, but that would make our current President look good. Can't do that.
It is true that Bush has always said that there is only one President at a time, (Obama has said the same thing by the way), BUT when YOUR President invites you to something of this magnitude you should come, if only out of  sense of patriotism, national duty, repentance, whatever, but you heed the invite of YOUR President, UNLESS you're one of these current Republicans.
I personally do not think that Bush has any business NEAR the World Trade Center.
People died because he was negligent of his duties. Additonal thousands died because he sent them to the wrong country, for the wrong reasons.
He then proceeded to further drop the ball and sound totally STUPID on national television by asserting and re-asserting quite erroneously and arrogantly that bin Laden was IRRELEVANT and not being pursued by his administration.
This is NOT SARCASM, this is just THE TRUTH.
Stay home Shrub, and mow the back forty.

viva Mr President,JOB WELL DONE.GOD BLESS OUR ARM  FORCES.forget about the teabergers,

	May 4, 2011 06:02 pm at 6:02 pm |

Alright since people want to trash Bush lets get to the truth. Without the intelligence architecture set up by Bush and waterboarding that scumbag Khalid Sheikh Mohammed we would not have identified the courier that led to bin Laden.  Bush set up the warrantless surveilance progeams that Obama and rest of loony left have pilloried him for but Obama has continued to use unabated.  Obama deserves credit for the killing but realize he succeeded despite his disavowing Bush policies that paved the way.  So it was great Obama woke up and continued the Bush policies.

	May 4, 2011 06:08 pm at 6:08 pm | 





Nelson
I'm so glad he is not attending. I think everyone forgot about back in march 2002 about president bush saying the following about bin laden six months after sept 11: "I'M REALLY NOT THAT CONCERNED ABOUT HIM." Bush quit finding bin laden! He didn't care! Obama on the other hand is showing how to really fight the war on terror. Also, in 2005, bush dismantled the CIA group to hunt down bin laden. Therefore, bin laden has been in that compound since 2005! To say bush deserves credit, I DON'T THINK SO! Obama finished the job! Bush quit finding bin laden!

	May 4, 2011 06:15 pm at 6:15 pm | 





New Age Independant
I have to laugh at liberals when they say this is "Obama's moment". Such a thought is ludicrous. Obama simply kept in place the policy of hunting down Bin Laden.  It was the right thing to do, and I give him credit for recognizing that fact.  With that said, I think it's a monumental mistake for Obama to try and make this into something about him and visit "ground zero" to commemorate the death of Bin Laden.  The fall of Bin Laden is just one event in a long road yet to come.  I don't mean to trivialize the efforts of the CIA and the special forces, but there is too much work to be done.  Too many threats that continue to exist for this to become a political statement.  It's classless and disturbing.

T'sah from Virginia
@The Day of Financial Reckoning is HERE
You guys are trying to give BUSH half the CREDIT for the capture and killing of Osama – So why shouldn't he go to Ground Zero and take HALF THE CREDIT????  Maybe it's because he feels he does not deserve HALF THE CREDIT!!!!!

	May 4, 2011 06:24 pm at 6:24 pm | 





Okme2
Not surprising to me. He's stupid and has made a host of stupid decisions. Add this to the stinking pile that is the past of a rediculous man.

	May 4, 2011 06:35 pm at 6:35 pm | 





Rewriting history again
Inmyopinion@5:50 p.m.
Bush abandoned the CIA unit in charge of hunting Bin Ladin in 2006.  Obama was criticized by McCain for wanting to go into Pakistan and get OBL without their permission.
All bush did was use a bullhorn, take his eye off the ball and give up in the hunt.

	May 4, 2011 06:52 pm at 6:52 pm |

Just further proves what half of us have said all along....no class, no concern what's best for America...it's just me, me, me...typical republican.

	May 4, 2011 06:53 pm at 6:53 pm |

To the sitting president goes the spoils . . . Period!

	May 4, 2011 07:18 pm at 7:18 pm | 





T'sah from Virginia
On another NOTE and I hope this gets posted:
The RIGHT want to take credit for the killing of Bin Laden – claiming BUSH had the intelligence and "torturing" was the key!!!  Okay – so I have a question – Would the SAME RIGHT take credit if the mission FAILED???????????????????????????????????  Oh NO they WON'T!!!!  They will BLAME President Obama and make up some OTHER PLAN that Bush would have followed if he were in charge – GIVE ME A BREAK – Dang!!!  And I guess if the Republicans were in charge they will "keep torturing!!!"
Just like Libya – the Republicans was FOR IT before they were against it – criticized it after they praised it and to this day would NEVER give President Obama credit for anything!!!  It's so outrageous and MANY Americans can see through it!!

	May 4, 2011 07:28 pm at 7:28 pm | 





U.S. Common Sense
I see no issue with Bush declining to attend the event.  As someone mentioned above, this is Obama's moment.  Bill Clinton didn't come out to the WTC with Bush right after the attack, even though Clinton was already fighting Bin Laden before the 2000 elections.
"John" said:  'No matter what Obama does the idiots from the right will always complain.'
It's quite obvious from some of the anti-Bush comments on here that the "idiot" door swings both ways.

	May 4, 2011 07:32 pm at 7:32 pm | 





LacrosseMom(real one)
Honestly, I do not know why Bush wouldn't want to be there to celebrate the end of Usama bin Laden.  IF Bush wanted to not be in the 'spotlight' then why did he go on a national tour to peddle his book? 
That's okay though, Bush can stay home.  After all, in 2007 when asked about Usama bin Laden, Bush said, "I don't know where he is, and I don't give him much thought."  SEVEN years Bush had to "get" bin Laden, and he didn't........ now along comes a president whom the Far-Right nuts despise, and ........ President Obama fulfills the promise he made on Oct. 7, 2008....... and the Far-Right is still spewing lies.  
@Inmyopinion: President Obama did not start the hunt for bin Laden......... HE FINISHED IT.

	May 4, 2011 07:43 pm at 7:43 pm | 





Frank
Please!  First Obama says that he wont release the photos because that's not what we do.  Now he is on his "I killed UBL" victory tour.  Is that what we do?  The pictures wont help Obama's re-election.  The victory tour might.   Why should Bush engage in this?  President Bush is far above this behavior!

	May 4, 2011 07:51 pm at 7:51 pm | 





Indy
Day of reckoning
Where is your proof that Obama was not telling the truth about Bush and Cheney We want proof !! If you want to thank Bush for the three trillion dollar diversion to Iraq go do it yourself because I am pretty sure you are the only one that thinks Bush should be commended for dropping the ball on Osama and taking the country to into financial ruins all while saying he did not care where Osama was. Think before you post !!

	May 4, 2011 07:55 pm at 7:55 pm | 





Indy
Inmyopinion
You really dont understand the difference in a forty minute operation to take the most wanted man in the world and Bush killing thousands of innocent people all while making Cheney and Haliburton rich ? You really dont see a difference between Obama methotically getting credible intellegence against the lies about weapons of mass destruction ? You seriously dont understand the difference ? I feel very sorry for you. God Bless

	May 4, 2011 08:01 pm at 8:01 pm | 





GonzoinHouston
Obama succeeded where Bush failed.  Bush doesn't want to stand next to the man who accomplished what Bush could not.  Bush's  presence would just invite comparisons of their respective approaches to the fight against terrorism.

	May 4, 2011 08:26 pm at 8:26 pm | 





Terry
Bush does not want the world to see this really short ex-prez standing next to the current-prez who is head and shoulders above him.

	May 4, 2011 08:26 pm at 8:26 pm | 





bassman
I applaud Pres. Bush for not taking a victory lap on the grave site of 3,000 Americans.

	May 4, 2011 08:43 pm at 8:43 pm | 





Albo58
What is obviously (or should I say, transparently?)  pathetic is Obama and his inept handlers do not see that this campaign stop only cheapens this accomplishment!  I can't blame Bush or anybody else for not wanting to be seen at this political pandering event

	May 4, 2011 08:44 pm at 8:44 pm | 





ruty
Bush is ashamed to show up. He is such an uncouth, redneck cowboy. I am glad he is not going. He is an embarassment to the USA.

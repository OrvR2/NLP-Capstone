NFL Picks Week 1: 3 Blowout Games Not Worth Watching




 
 Justin K. Aller/Getty Images I would never say that an NFL game is not worth watching, but every week there will undoubtedly be a few blowouts that leave you channel surfing.Here are three games that you'll want to turn off by the end of the third quarter.Atlanta at ChicagoThis matchup seems intriguing at first with Atlanta taking their high powered offense into Soldier Field, where the Bears consistently boast one of the league's best defenses.However, I don't think this one's going to be close at all.Matt Ryan was simply phenomenal last year and he's got all sorts of help: Roddy White and Julio Jones on the outside, a slightly washed-up Tony Gonzales in the middle, and Michael Turner in the backfield.Atlanta just has too many weapons and Chicago won't be able to hang for very long.Plus Jay Cutler will probably throw a few crippling interceptions. He tends to do that.Minnesota at San DiegoLike the Atlanta/Chicago game, San Diego's offense just has too many weapons offensively. Unlike the Atlanta/Chicago game, the Chargers also come equipped with one of the NFL's top defenses.I've always liked Donovan McNabb, but frankly I've lost all faith in his abilities. He had more interceptions than touchdowns last year and I don't feel like he's the answer for the Vikings quarterback woes.It doesn't help that his first game is against the Chargers, who allowed the fewest passing yards in the league last year.The Vikings will be totally reliant on Adrian Peterson yet again, but he shouldn't expect to find much running room in San Diego. The Chargers also boast one of the NFL's best run defenses, giving up just 93.8 rushing yards per game in 2010.As far as the Chargers offense, I can't stand Phillip Rivers but there's no denying his skills. Look for him to hook up with Vincent Jackson and Antonio Gates for at least a couple scores.New York Giants at Washington Personally, I think the Redskins are screwed this year. They're in a very tough division, their offense is frighteningly devoid of talent, and their defense last year was, well, terrible.John Beck will probably spend most of Sunday on his back thanks to Giants pass rushers Justin Tuck, Mathias Kiwanuka and Osi Umenyiora (who's currently questionable with a knee injury).Eli Manning has reliable targets in Hakeem Nicks and Mario Manningham, both of whom should find gaps in Washington's secondary.Sorry Washington fans, I think a rocky season is in order and it's going to start with a blowout loss against a division rival.  Most recent updates: NFL Picks Week 1: 3 Teams That Won’t Cover Spread in Victory NFL Picks Week 1: Cam Newton Will Struggle in Regular Season Debut NFL Picks Week 1: Texans' March to Playoffs Begins with Win vs Colts View all updates

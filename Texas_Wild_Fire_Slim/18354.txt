Texas Wildfire Devastation
The Austin Skyline September 5th 2011Thank you to Austinite Deanna Roy for capturing the true magnitude of the fires and allowing the photograph's use for charitable purposes.You can visit Deanna's website at www.DeannaRoy.com
If all you know of Texas is from movies, you’re probably picturing dusty trails, flat prairies, and a tumbleweed or two .  But that’s not the Texas I know, and it’s not the part that’s going up in smoke.  The Texas I know is filled with hills and trees, lakes and rivers, and broad city skylines.  North and south Austin are determined by what side of the river you’re on, and the west side of town offers windsurfing, cliff-diving (even for us non-werewolves), and sunset cruises on the lake.
But now it seems the whole state is on fire.  Labor Day weekend saw an explosion of fires across the state, with more than 60 new ones reported in a single day.  Only 100 acres remain of a 6000 acre historical state park just east of Austin.  More than a thousand homes in this area alone have been reduced to ashes, and thousands have fled to shelters.  In the city of Austin, 40 police officers are now homeless.  Smaller towns with only volunteer firefighters and single, used firetrucks were forced to fend for themselves, as nearby cities had their own fires to fight.  My own family lost two homes, and we’re waiting for word on three more.  Half of the small community where I grew up is nothing but blackened landscape now.  And today, the government has asked the residents of Austin to stay indoors, as the black smoke descending upon us is making breathing difficult.  And the fires still burn.
Yesterday, the Texas Forest Service responded to 19 new fires, and in the past seven days, they have responded to 172 fires burning 135,051 acres. Giant plumes of smoke can be seen from space, and half the state is under a haze that stretches out into the Gulf of Mexico.  While the Austin area may be my home and where I’ve seen so much damage, areas around Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas are burning as well.  This season has seen enough burnt ground in Texas to fill the state of Connecticut, and still the fires are uncontained.
People we all know in this fandom are still waiting in hotels and shelters to find out if their homes are still standing.  Laurnorder and I are asking for the fandom’s help in trying to make a difference for so many who’ve been displaced and have lost family members, homes, businesses, and beloved pets.  If you’d like to sign up to write for the compilation please fill out the sign up form so we can list you on the contributing authors page.  All who forward to us a receipt of their donation to an agency aiding in the Texas Wildfire Relief Efforts will receive a PDF compilation of fanfiction and original fiction stories. The due date for both donation receipts and stories is November 1st.

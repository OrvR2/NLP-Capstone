ORLANDO, Fla. -- A scuffle between an Orange County sheriff's deputy and a UCF student at the school's football game  against Boston College was captured on video and posted to YouTube.The nearly two-minute video shows the fan pushing the deputy, who grabs the fan by the neck.  Another deputy then joins the fracas and appears to attempt to use a stun gun, although it's unclear if the fan was shocked.The video then shows the fan grabbing the deputy in a bear hug, and the deputy lands on top of the fan as they fall to the ground.The YouTube poster said the video only captured about 25 percent of the incident."By the time I started recording I hadn't gotten about 3/4 of the whole thing. But just before I started, the sheriff was holding the fan's neck over the railing.  What I recorded doesn't accurately reflect the whole confrontation," the YouTube poster said.The Orange County Sheriff's Office said Andrew Galbo was arrested Saturday on charges of attempted aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer, battery on a law enforcement officer, trespass on property after being warned and resisting an officer with violence.According to the Sheriff's Office, UCF event staff members were trying to escort Galbo out of the stadium when Orange County Deputy Shaun Halleran, who was working an off-duty assignment at the game, assisted.In a report, Halleran said Galbo, whose breath reeked of alcohol, refused to leave and held onto a stadium railing.  Galbo repeatedly told Halleran, "Don't touch me, bro."Halleran said in the report that he used a "palm strike" to Galbo's chest as he continued to resist.  The scuffle then ensued, and a Seminole County sheriff's deputy assisted Halleran, the report said.Galbo then tried to pull on Halleran's belt, and the deputy was concerned that he was trying to grab one of his weapons, the report said.Galbo also spit in Halleran's face and kneed him in the leg during the fracas, the report said.Galbo was eventually escorted to a UCF police substation.The report didn't state if Galbo was shocked with a stun gun.Halleran suffered abrasions to his hands and bruises to his knees, the report said.On the field, UCF beat Boston College 30-3 to move to 2-0 on the season.Watch Local 6 and stay with ClickOrlando.com for more on this story.

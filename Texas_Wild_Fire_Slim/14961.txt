Climate Disasters Dominate America’s Front Pages

By Brad Johnson  on Sep 9, 2011 at 5:06 pm

Extreme weather disasters, fueled by global warming pollution, dominate the nation’s news, even as the contenders for the Republican presidential nomination vie to scorn the threat of climate change. Even those who purport to accept the science of global warming, such as Jon Huntsman Jr., argue that making our climate less deadly would hurt the economy.
The montage below is drawn from a few front-page headlines from the nation’s newspapers on Thursday and Friday, via the Newseum. From the record, killer wildfires in Texas to the record, killer floods in the Northeast, our nation is under attack by a poisoned climate system.

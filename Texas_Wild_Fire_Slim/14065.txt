Texas wildfires: How to help and raise money for fire victims

Many parts of Texas have been slammed with an almost unprecedented outbreak of massive wildfires. According to the Texas Forest Service, over 135,000 acres have been blackened by wildfires over the past 7 days. In the past 48 hours alone, officials estimate over 1000 homes have been destroyed. 
The largest fire occurred in Bastrop County, where as of this morning at least 33,000 acres have destroyed more than 700 homes and blackened nearly all of Bastrop State Park. So far two people have been reported dead as a result. And after 4 days, this fire is now only 30 percent contained. 
 
Several other fires are burning across the state with numerous homes lost. For the latest update from the Texas Forest Service, click here. Additional information on the fires is also available here. 
 
As chaos and tragedy erupts from the scorching wildfires across the Lone Star State, people from all over the state have connected with one another through social media. Concerned residents, local reporters, Emergency Management officials, and others have been checking in on both Facebook and Twitter to share and gather time-sensitive information.

Here is a list of Facebook pages I recommend following for up to date information:
Texas Storm Chasers 
Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) Police Scanner
Williamson County Office of Emergency Management 
Magnolia TX Fire and Evacuation Information
Upshur County Emergency Citizen Communications
Central Texas fires 2011 
Fisk Consultants Group (FCG) 
KYTX CBS19 Facebook
Texas Fire Fighters
North Texas Longhorn Weather
 
There have also been many great reports on Twitter, way too many to list. However, for the most up to date information, be sure to follow the #TXFire #CentralTXFires and #SATXWildfire hash tags. 
 
If you have a page you would like to recommend, please let me know and I will include them on the list. 
 
It is very important to keep in mind that even with the best intentions, not everything you read online is true. Many false rumors have gone around, so you must verify each bit of information that you read. Like any crisis, misinformation can spread rapidly. The good news is that most of the false bits of information get rebuked fairly quickly. 
 
How to help
 
For interest of full disclosure, I do earn revenue of just under a penny per read on Examiner.com in addition to a dollar for writing local, and on topic. I cannot in good conscience write about the fire, and the destruction or life and property and accept any revenue from it. Therefore, any revenue I earn from today (September 7th) through my next payout (September 20th), I will donate to fire relief. Starting tomorrow, I will post screen shots of my daily revenue on my facebook page, Anthony Torres Weather, and on my twitter page @AnthonyTorresWx so that everyone can keep track how much money you raised. 
 
Examiner updates the daily revenues somewhere between 5 and 6 AM CDT every morning. I will be sure to post my latest daily revenue from each of those days to show everyone how much will be donated.
 
I have not decided where I will donate as I hope to decide that from your help. Right now, I want to focus in on helping the hardest hit area in Bastrop. The only thing I ask is that the the donation must be accepted by PayPal. Please help spread the word by sharing this and all my other articles with your friends and family. This is by far the easiest way to help. 
 
That said, below is a short list of links I have compiled by region detailing where you can donate. If you know of any other places accepting donations, please let me know on my Facebook or Twitter page, or simply comment below. I will add onto and edit this article as necessary. I plan to add as much as possible to this list.

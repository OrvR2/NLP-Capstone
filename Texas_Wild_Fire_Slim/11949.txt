Sadly though, for fans of the Oilers the possibilities are a little more limited than they are for most of the NHL's other fan bases. Coming off back-to-back last place finishes, the Oilers are once again the odds on favourite to be right at the bottom of the league this season. With the rebuild in full swing, the only hope that the rebuild will ever end is success at the draft table. So while fans of most teams dream of Stanley Cup parades, I find myself thinking ahead to next June's NHL Entry Draft.

In addition to using social media to help educate others about Lincoln's life and legacy, I have recently begun lecturing to public and private groups about different aspects of Lincoln. In recent months, I've spoken on his Inaugural Journey to Washington in 1861; his assassination and funeral train journey back to Springfield in 1865; and his struggles to find competent generals during the Civil War.My next scheduled lecture will be about Lincoln's numerous ties to my home state of Ohio. While he of course never lived in the Buckeye State, he gave speeches in Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland. Ohioans Salmon B. Chase and Edwin M. Stanton served in his cabinetac

Reese Witherspoon Struck By Car While Jogging | TMZ.com

Let me go ahead and fill in the specifics using common sense. Seeing as how she attained no injuries, it’s likely Witherspoon was running across the street when a motorist waiting at a stop sign either went without looking or decided to be a douche and prove a point. Either way, his or her vehicle made contact going less than five miles an hour, knocking Reese to the ground. She got up, decided not to be a hero and went to the hospital to verify her organs weren’t secretly bleeding.

The remarks from Huntsman came in response to a question on whether he believes the country is safer today as a result of the nation's counter-terrorism efforts in a post-9/11 era. Looking ahead to the ten year anniversary of the tragic day he said, "I think one way to commemorate our ten-year anniversary of 9/11, remembering the 3,000-plus people who died in New York and in Pennsylvania and in Washington, is to say it's time for this country to set a goal for ourselves: We're going to get our core fixed. We're going to do some nation-building right here at home."

There is a tendency in the sports world to expect the injuries that superstar athletes suffer to match the spectacle and drama of the contests themselves – we are awed by NASCAR crashes, we marvel at the expressionless face that Muhammed Ali is left with after the pounding he took at the end of his career and we still immortalize Joe Thiesman’s legendary broken leg.

"Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did, Mitt," Perry jabbed in the debate's opening moments, referring to one of Romney's Democratic predecessors as governor of Massachusetts."As a matter of fact, George Bush and his predecessors created jobs at a faster rate than you did," Romney shot back at Perry, the 10-year incumbent Texas governor.The debate was the first of three in as many weeks, at a time when the economy is struggling, unemployment is seemingly stuck at 9.1 percent and Obama's popularity is sinking in the polls - all events that could make the GOP nomination worth more than it appeared only a few months ago.

In the interview Chenoweth says that just because she is a Christian it doesn’t mean she blindly follows what others say her religion asks of her, and that instead she relies on the old adage of “What would Jesus do?”, affirming she doesn’t believe Jesus would walk around saying “You’re going to hell” and “You’re wrong, you’re wrong, you’re wrong,” but would instead be accepting and loving of people.

Who was Tamar? We encounter her in the book of Genesis ch.38. She was the daughter-in-law of Judah, one of Jacob’s children. She was given in marriage to two of Judah’s sons, Er and Onan, who both died because they offended Yahweh. Fearing that his third son might befall the same fate, Judah did not allow him to marry Tamar. Tamar disguised herself as a prostitute and seduced Judah, her father-in-law in order to have an heir by him without his knowledge. She bore the twins Perez and Zerah.

LOLA: “It was so humid! I hadn’t expected that. Now I’ve been to three very humid cities – Hong Kong, Singapore and Honiara.”We only stayed 24 hours, but managed to go around the Botanic Garden and see the spot where rubber trees were first trialled, take a great boat trip from Clarke’s Quay, get a bit tiddly on Singapore Slings at the famous Raffles Hotel (see pic) and finally meet a friend, Tony, for noodles at one of the Hawker sites. These offer tasty food – carrot cake which is more like spicey omelette is a must try, especially if you don’t want chilli crab – all at dirt cheap prices, approx £3 or £4 a dish.

These are a few of her most eye-catching pieces.acMumbai-born designer Shilpa Chavan, known better as Little Shilpa, has made her mark in fashion capitals around the world.

Kirton added that his client further related that while he was being beaten he was forced to have anal sex with Shaw. Both Brown and Shaw, the lawyer related, were then made to sign confession statements related to three robbery under arms matters for which they were charged.According to Kirton, all of the issues were raised in court yesterday, and the Magistrate asked the Prosecutor to make arrangements for his clients to see a doctor. He added that his clients’ complaints were documented in the court. However he said he is hopeful that the police carry out a thorough investigation into the matter.

On matters large and small, Obama has yielded to House Speaker John Boehner in a string of concessions that have unnerved Democrats and emboldened Republicans. A chorus of Democratic voices is now demanding that the president abandon his attempts at being a compromiser and instead lay out an ideological vision that distinguishes him from Republicans and becomes a template for his re-election

Firstly, I don’t know why they want to do this Doraemon wearing Chinese zodiac costume soft toy. They look ugly. I prefer either Doraemon by itself or the Chinese zodiac by itself. Not combined. But maybe that is just me.What I cannot understand is the logic behind McDonald’s exclusion of the pig from the Chinese zodiac series. The Chinese zodiac animals is a part of the Chinese culture. There are 12 animals. You cannot remove 1 of the animals and still call it the Chinese zodiac. Does McDonalds know how many customers are born in the year of the pig? How would they feel if their zodiac is being excluded?

Ramkissoon thought about defying her leader, grabbing Javon and leaving the house. But she didn't think Antoinette would maliciously make up her claim that the boy was possessed by an evil spirit. And she didn't want to defy God's will, guaranteeing eternal damnation.So she did nothing.Nobody else in the 10-person household came to Javon's aid either. Over the next week, he whimpered and grew sluggish and sallow. By the time Antoinette relented and told Ramkissoon to feed the boy, it was too late. Javon died in his mother's arms.

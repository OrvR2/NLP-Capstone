Bird's Eye view of Bastrop firesCongressman takes a helicopter tour over wildfiresUpdated: Sunday, 11 Sep 2011, 6:48 PM CDTPublished : Sunday, 11 Sep 2011, 5:17 PM CDT

No matter what your vantage point, the destruction from the Bastrop fire is massive. On the ground, scorched land, charred homes and little else remains. The view from above though, is even more sobering. Sunday afternoon, KXAN and Congressman Michael McCaul (R-TX) took a DPS helicopter tour of the path the flames blazed through Central Texas. From the skies you could see smoke, hot spots and little else. Trees have turned from green to black. Homes are nothing more than a pile of ash and brick. The Congressman told KXAN the scene was heart wrenching. "It's a disaster," Congressman McCaul said shortly after the flight. "Mile after mile of burnt acreage, homes burnt to the ground. It is going to take a long time to recover." Congressman McCaul said this was not his first tour of the wreckage. He spent some time on the scene of the fire from the very beginning and told us from the very first day of the blaze he has seen signs of resilience. "One image I will take away is a house I saw that had burnt down and there was an American and Texas flag still in tact; still waving in the wind. That gives me some hope and optimism," he said. He also added that the focus now must turn to rebuilding and starting over again. "At the local level, let me tell you the the level of giving is amazing. The assistance from the state and now from FEMA. I can tell you we are going to get you through this. That's what Texans do. We are going to get you through this," Congressman McCaul said. FEMA is on the scene in Bastrop and if you need there assistance you can contact them at the Grady tuck Building at 104 Loop 150 West or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA(3362) Â

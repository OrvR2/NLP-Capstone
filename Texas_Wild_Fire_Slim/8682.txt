Guitar-maker Gibson denies 'smuggling' after US raidAFP – Fri, Sep 2, 2011

Gibson Guitar Corp. renewed its plea of innocence on Friday after US agents raided its Tennessee plants and seized rare ebony wood from India used to make some of the world's most coveted guitars. 
"We were not engaged in smuggling," chief executive Henry Juszkiewicz told CNN television. "We have been importing fingerboard stock on a regular basis from India for 17 years." 
It was the second raid in as many years targeting the makers of Les Paul, Epiphone and other guitars favored by such artists as B.B. King, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, U2's The Edge, and the late Bob Marley and John Lennon.
"It was a nightmare. We had people sitting there making guitars. We had no weapons," said Juszkiewicz, who reckoned the raids in Memphis and Nashville cost Gibson about $1 million in seized wood and documents.
Imported woods are important in guitar-making, with different species lending different tones and texture to an instrument's sound.
While Gibson has not been criminally charged, wildlife agents reportedly suspect it might have violated a US law that forbids the import of wood exported in violation of another country's laws.
"We're still in the investigating stage at this point so there's not a lot that we can say," a spokesman for the US Fish and Wildlife Service told AFP in Washington.
The raids on August 24 has left globe-travelling guitarists worried that their instruments could be seized by customs if they cannot prove the origin of the wood used to make them.
"The law says that if a guitar or instrument of any kind crosses a border, you have to know the species of wood that every component is made of and where it came from," Juszkiewicz said.

Thank you, Mr Obama. I feel so much safer knowing now that a few pieces of wood are a higher priority and the jobs of 14 million Americans. Maybe next time you can go after companies who are harbouring illegal rocks.

And, Fabio, one of the few guitar companies to be non-union.  This is most certainly either selective enforcement .... more likely harrassment than anything else.  Anything to try to shore up his union support.  Kinda makes me sick.....but doesn't make me surprised.

Good ole Eric Holder denies any political assassination attempts against Gibson for being the only Guitar Manufacturer in America to donate to the Republican Party while also being the only American Guitar Manufacturer to have their Rosewood confiscated, Isn’t this the same Eric Holder that decided not to prosecute New Black Panthers in Philadelphia for a voter harassment case, claiming that the case against them demeaned his people. The same Eric Holder from the Administration that rewards supporters with an inordinate amount Government Stimulus Dollars and aide. He’s a corrupt Black Nationalist Nazi and his people are not the American People.

You think I will believe anything the potus has to say w.r.t. jobs when they are hard handling folk that actually create jobs here?   This is all about unions and politics folks.   Holder, when he's not trying to kill Americans (Fast and Furious fiasco) in order to undermine the second amendment, is going after folk who are either not unionized or not Democrats.   We have a corrupted government that only can be appreciated by Orwell.   Stop this madness now and keep shining the light on these thugs; maybe we can get at least Holder kicked out.   :)

Typical example of how our government is undermining efforts to keep jobs in the U.S.: it was considered legal to import pre-finished fingerboards from other countires here, but illegal to import the raw stock and use American labor to build the finished product? While there are so many people in our country out of work due to outsourcing, our own government agencies decides to deliver a swift kick to one of our 'Made in the USA' companies? It's a total outrage! We need to maintain a manufacturing base in our country and companies like Gibson have been trying to do just that. According to reports, Gibson employees 40 people in their factory to make their guitar fingerboards. That's 40 jobs that are being kept in this country and not outsourced to India, Indonesia or China. Our politicians and government need to quit biting the hands that feed them and do more to support ameican manufacturing! Not LESS!

OK, the Gibson CEO is a Republican and I just saw on the news that his factory, unlike the other big boy, Fender, is non-union. I am a guitarist. My American made Stratocaster has a rosewood fingerboard. Fender and Gibson both get their rosewood from the same supplier, so why is Gibson being raided and harassed? Gee, I wonder...

Well now Mr. Gibson, that is what you deserve for being a Huckabee supporter in the last election! Get on board the "corporatist" train my friend or get your knees broken! Mussolini is dead, so that Hugo Chavez sycophant, Eric Holder, must be running our economy now through our Department of Criminal Justice!

Gibson has government letters from both Madagascar and India saying the purchases were in order and legitimate. But the Justice Department said, "they interpret Indian law differently than the Indian government does!" What the hell?

This article was so buried in the depths of Yahoo news, I can almost guarantee that each of the 20 other comments are from people who were outraged enough to seek it out, like I was.

Gibson is a non union manufacturer, Hoffa's head must be exploding... I love it

How does suspicion of possessing wood without the correct paperwork warrant government agents with guns?  It's getting scary out there......

Every industry is being targeted by our communist government.  They are in full knowledge of what they are doing and this is just another piece in the puzzle.  Another brick in the wall of the Feds to make "We the People" reliant on the communists that have taken over our government.

Could Gwyneth Paltrow be saying goodbye to her leading lady status? Between guest starring as the lovable Holly Holliday on FOX's musical comedy "Glee" and a taking small part in the Hollywood thriller "Contagion," it looks like Gwyneth is taking a step back from major career commitments.
"I have little kids, and I'm a full-time mom," Gwyneth said while promoting her film at the Venice Film Festival. "I really only do small parts." 
The Oscar-winning actress--who is mother to daughter Apple, seven, and son Moses, five, with husband Chris Martin--appears alongside Kate Winslet, Matt Damon and Jude Law in Steven Soderbergh's disaster movie "Contagion." And it looks like Gwyneth is sticking to her new gig as a supporting role actress. After all, she only appears in the ensamble cast thriller for the first 15 minutes. 
Although Apple and Moses are her first priorities, she did take some time to relax in Venice--on Jay-Z's boat, of course. Gwyneth stopped by to congratulate her famous friend Beyonce on her thirtieth birthday and possibly give Beyonce some baby advice, since Beyonce recently announced her pregnancy at the 2011 MTV VMAs. 
But somehow, we don't see Beyonce slowing down anytime soon.

The traditional mariachi band includes a guitarrón, a vihuela, a guitar, violins, and trumpets, but sometimes you just have to make due.
Introducing, the Coca Cola trumpet, the latest musical craze -- judging only by the following video -- to sweep across Mexico. Located in Ciudad Juarez, this resourceful entertainer actually teases out quite the authentic brassy sound from the plastic soda bottle.
Maybe the "trumpet" player and this water jug tuba player should start a band?
Pretty incredible, or as one top commenter put it, "Solo en Mexico."

				I think it's real, but am no video forensics expert.  If it is real...?  It's stuff like this that gives me hope for the human race.  Out of garbage, he makes a trumpet.  Got to love it.  I think Colbert should send someone to find this band and put them on the Report.

				Fake.  The overtone series is wrong.  He can't have the chromatics he uses in that register.  He'd have to have a valve to play the steps and half steps you hear, and *if* his fingers are covering tone holes, it still doesn't work -- his fingers seem to move at random.

				If coca cola claim that the dispatches documentar­y by Mark Thomas was full of out dated and innaccurat­e allegation­s about their company and business practices- why did they only produce a website containing their reply and why not ( being one of the richest global companies) sue him and the makers of the documentar­y?

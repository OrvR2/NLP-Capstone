You Need A Budget. Yes, You.By Sierra Black | Forbes – Fri, Jul 29, 2011




Related ContentYou Need A Budget. Yes, You.


This post provided by SavingsAccounts.com.
Budgeting has a bad rap. It's one of the least glamorous aspects of personal finance. It lacks both the thrill of clever investing and the fun of money-saving DIY life hacks. Most of the time, building and maintaining a budget is downright boring.
It's also essential. An article in the New York Times Bucks blog calls budgeting your most essential financial task. Call it what you will: a budget, a spending plan, cash flow management. If you're going to establish and maintain a solid financial foundation for your life, it's imperative that you know where your money comes from and where it goes. All of it.
As the Bucks blog says:
Financial goals get funded with dollars. Dollars tend to slip through our hands unless we have a system for plugging those holes. We can only plug those holes if we know they exist. So managing cash flow is not something that gets in the way of reaching financial goals; it's the key to reaching them.
Once you've established clear financial goals, having a clear spending plan is the key to making progress on those goals and growing your high-interest savings account. Your budget is where you decide how much of each paycheck you're going to devote to retirement savings, how much you need to cover your living expenses and how much you can put toward that dream vacation.

Beyond budgeting
Of course, it's not enough to carefully craft a budget once and then never look at it again. Once you have a spending plan in place, you'll want to periodically reconcile your actual spending with your budgeted amounts. To do so, you need to have records of where your money goes.
You can do this with a simple notebook where you jot down every time you spend money, or you can use personal finance software like Mint or Quicken. The important thing is to find a record-keeping system that works for you and use it.
Keeping careful records of everything you spend can help you spot problem areas as they emerge, before you go broke buying comic books or impulsively spend your vacation savings on a new couch.
When you're just starting out, you may want to check your actual spending against your planned spending as often as once a week. Over time, you'll be able to babysit it less. Once a month is about right for most people to do budget reconciliation. You may even find you can stretch it to quarterly, if your spending is pretty stable.
Automate what you can
In addition to carefully monitoring your spending, you can automate aspects of your financial life to help you stay on track with your budget. In particular, you can set up automatic bill payments and savings account deposits.
If you're employed, and your employer offers a retirement plan, you probably already have automatic deposits to your retirement accounts. That money disappears from your check before you ever see it, making it painless to save. You can set up similar deposits into your personal savings accounts as well.
Using an online bank like ING, you can direct savings automatically to a series of targeted sub-accounts dedicated to your particular financial goals. I have a sub-account for my daughters' educations, another one for holiday spending and a third for family travel. Each week, an automated deposit is made to each account, according to what we've budgeted for each category. This keeps me on track with my savings goals, and protects us from getting hit with a pile of extra expenses when the holidays roll around or it's time to visit family.
Face the facts
One reason people avoid budgeting is that looking at our spending habits can make us face up to some uncomfortable truths. Hidden in the data are things we don't want to know about ourselves, like just how many lattes we drink in a month or how much we're really paying for Internet and cable.
Hiding from the truth about your financial life won't make the problems go away. We all know this and yet it's hard to resist the urge to dodge reality. If you find yourself tempted to bury your head in the sand, try working on your budget in small bites, or finding a partner to help you with it. Being held accountable by your spouse or a friend dealing with similar issues may help you stick with it Your savings account will thank you.

it's actually very simple.. Make savings as your expenses! Meaning, when you do the budgeting like paying for house rent, electricity, phone bills etc then treat savings as your expenses.. No matter how small your pay is, you can really save if you want to..It doesn't matter if it's small amount coz if it piles up each month, you'll be amaze of the figures. Trust me!

mareklamo lng naman tayo mga pinoy pagdating sa pera, puro hindi kasya ang sueldo
pero see u naman kung pano mamuhay, nauuna ang bisyo, yabang, di magsisip kung pano 
gagamitin ang pera, di unahin ang pang araw2 na gastusin bago ang lahat, una food dpat
ang priority, fixed bills, saka na un iba kung san u dadalhin. savings isama na sa budget.

PEOPLE NOWADAYS REALLY KNOW HOW TO PISSED OFF OTHERS. You know what? LIFE IS EQUAL. YOU JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH CHOICE. Absolutely, expending today = no money tomorrow or not expending today = money tomorrow! It's just the same! LOL. The best thing is that YOU ENJOYED YOUR LIFE. Sometimes, pressuring yourself up too much can cause larger damages that will lead to failing family bonding and suicidal attempt if you're too harsh. JUST BREATHE, DO YOUR BEST AND GOD WILL DO THE REST!

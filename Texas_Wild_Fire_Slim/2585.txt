Republican U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk defended President Obama's jobs speech scheduled for Thursday in light of 8th District Rep. Joe Walsh's announcement that he would skip it, but encouraged the president to share its contents with House Speaker John Boehner to set a tone for bipartisanship.
"I will be in the chamber, because you have to respect the office," the Highland Park resident said, according to NBC Chicago. "Even if you campaigned against the current office holder, you respect the office and the role of the joint session is in the Constitution."
Kirk, who has developed a list of nearly two dozen economic policies he believes will get "huge majorities" in Congress, recommended that Obama give the Republican Speaker a preview of the jobs plan he will outline to foster a sense of bipartisan cooperation, he told WGN.
“I hope procedurally what the president does in the next two days, he brings the speaker in and does a kind of a preview and works with him some, because you’ve got to listen to what the American people said in 2008 and 2010," Kirk told the Chicago Tribune. "They elected a divided government. The point is to get something done."
Kirk, who is also a U.S. Naval intelligence officer, recently returned from a two-week deployment in Afghanistan with a bold proposition as part of his economic policy arsenal calling for an immediate end to U.S. aid to Pakistan, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.
Kirk also took a position on the U.S. Postal Services $9.2 billion deficit, saying he doesn't think they will "close this winter or close at all" but declining to offer suggestions to combat the deficit, the Daily Herald reports.
In the meantime, he plans to take many notes on Thursday's speech, Kirk told the Daily Herald.

				I wish I could believe that Kirk was being a stateman.  I would have so much respect for him.  But, as others have posted, showing Boehner the speech ahead of time would be disastrous­, because there is no trust.  Obama thought he had an agreement on the debt ceiling, and then Boehner pulled out the rug. He also thought Boehner was okay with a Wed. night speech, and got rolled.
It would be nice to believe Kirk, but at this point in time, I don't.

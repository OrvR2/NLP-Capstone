NASA’s Cassini orbiter snaps unbelievable picture of SaturnBy Mike Wehner, Tecca | Today in Tech – 20 hrs ago

Sometimes reality is just as stunning as science fiction
Science fiction movies have spoiled us on high definition views of our planetary neighbors, but real-life photographs with equal jaw-dropping potential are exceedingly rare. That's what makes NASA's awe-inspiring snapshot of Saturn (hi-res version here) such a stunning piece of eye candy.
Taken by NASA's Cassini robotic orbiter, the shot was captured from the dark side of Saturn as the Sun's bright rays illuminated every piece of dust and debris circling the planet. Cassini has offered astronomers a never-before-seen look at Saturn and revealed more information about the planet than any craft before it. The craft has taken so many pictures of the ringed wonder that they were recently made into a short flyby film that looks like it was created by George Lucas rather than a robotic space explorer.
The Cassini probe was launched in 1997 and took a further 7 years to reach Saturn's orbit. The total cost of its overarching objective of studying the ringed planet stands at a staggering $3.26 billion. However, the wealth of information it has wrought — including amazing pictures like the one above, and recordings of massive lightning storms on the planet — have already made it one of the best investments in space exploration. Hopefully Juno — which began a 5-year trek to Jupiter just last month — will bring us some equally stunning shots of Saturn's neighbor.

How do you get a picture like that from the dark side of the planet. Where does the light come from?

i cant think of a better way to spend $3.26 billion... its not like the money would be better used to help our country out of some of its problems. why not spend all that money on a bunch of pics? come on! we already know what the planet looks like. its not doing and research or anything of value that will help out mankind. yes the pic is pretty, no argument there, but its not helping us.wanna go play around in soace, thats great but be helpful. go find another planet that we can live on. removing some people from this planet would at least make the world less crowded and give the earth a fighting chance to heal itself. there are so many better things to spend all that money on... but nasa wants to spend it on some damn pics.

You people are massive twats. Do you have any idea what new breakthroughs and technologies NASA has helped put forward. NASA advocates exploration and science. Expanding horizons and reaching the stars. Don’t you know how many people have jobs because of NASA? Okay, let’s shut NASA down. Let your tax dollars go toward a welfare line and a stupid war. We need to stop killing each other and giving handouts to people who don’t need it. We need to explore as a planet and cooperate as a planet united, not as nations divided. That’s the only way our species will survive in the long run.

The figure in this article seems to be fake. In a real image, the rings would overlap the sphere.

Wow, The bitterness of some of the people on here never ceases to amaze me. I mean, I'm not big on mixing Gov and Religion either, but to show so much bitterness for a comment that say's "Beautiful, Thank You God" ? It's SAD really... If the people on here are that upset with Government, Than maybe they should channel some of that energy into calling/writing their Representatives and telling them that they are tired of all the moral rhetoric that has nothing to do with running the country, Instead of turning something Beautiful into some bitter political statement that has nothing to do with Beauty or God. Just a thought.

Beautiful! When you consider the complex design, math, balance and everything else, it's hard for me to believe any arguement that there is no God!

Sounds like a waste of 3.26 billion.  Next time NASA should send out the Photoshop image before they spend all my tax dollars.

We are no longer the leaders in science, and science related fields, engineering for example, thanks in part to the anti-science crowd like most (not all) of these GOP candidates. They want us to be number one in science and then dismiss scientific study, particularly if it doesn't fit their religious/political view. Just like the fools that destroyed Galileo.

Beautiful, yes.  But let's put aside the 3.26 BILLION dollars that was spent for a second.  If you offered me even $3.26 million I would not be taking pictures of a planet I will NEVER EVER set foot on.  Can we please look to spend this money on something like, I don't know... Education!

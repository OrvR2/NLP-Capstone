NBC’s Andrea Mitchell: I have breast cancerBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – 10 hrs ago


Andrea Mitchell, NBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent and host of an eponymous MSNBC show, announced on Wednesday that she has breast cancer.
The 64-year-old Mitchell made the announcement at the end of her show, "Andrea Mitchell Reports."
"And now a personal note, or how I spent my summer vacation: I had planned to be hiking in Wyoming last week," Mitchell said, "but instead discovered that I am now among the one in eight women in this country--incredibly, one in eight--who've had breast cancer."
"Mine was discovered during my annual screening just a short time ago," she continued. "Luckily for me, I'm one of the fortunate ones. We discovered it in the earliest stage, it had not spread, and I'm already back at work with a terrific prognosis."
Mitchell urged female viewers to get screened.
"I'm looking at this as another of life's lessons," she said. "For you women out there and for the men who love you, screening matters. Do it."

Sorry to hear that. cancer is something no one should have to go through. I only wish more people had access to treatment centers, but unfortunately for them, most treatment centers are profit driven.

I thought she had some kind of cancer 20 or 30 years ago, but they didn't mention it here.  Perhaps I'm confusing her with another NBC reporter.  Glad she found it in time.  It's very curable in the first few months or year, but after about 2 years it's very deadly, I'm told.

Google Curcumin and cancer.  It's a kinase inhibitor (makes cancer cells self-destruct) and is active against breast cancer cells.  Big Pharm is trying to synthesize it.  A clinical dose is 4.7grams a day.  It's available from online vitamin stores for less than $25 a month.

Sorry about the illness.
However, she's married to Alan Greenspan.
So she's another One-Worlder.
Get the truth reported from her?
Oh sure.

Upcoming  meetings*  Monday, 6:30 p.m., Hewitt Community Center, 208 Chama Dr., Hewitt*  Tuesday,  6:30 p.m., Waco Transit Administration building, 301 S. 8th St., Suite 100*  Thursday, noon, Dr. Mae Jackson Development Center, 401 Franklin Ave.





A Waco transportation organization is updating plans for a new overpass on U.S. Highway 84 at Speegleville, cutting back its scope and chopping millions of dollars off its expected price tag.As part of the switch, the Waco Metropolitan Planning Organization is holding three public hearings this week so it can make changes to its long-term priority list reflecting the nearly  $7 million in savings.MPO director Chris Evilia said the update will show a dramatic reduction in the cost for acquiring private land to accommodate the project.The cost, according to documents that will be  presented at the public  meetings, show a new right-of-way price tag of $6.3 million, down from $13.1 million.“The original plan also extended the (U.S. 84) frontage road all the way to Harris Creek Road,” Evilia said.Under the new plans, the road would be extended to Bosque Lane, he said.mshapiro@wacotrib.com757-5707

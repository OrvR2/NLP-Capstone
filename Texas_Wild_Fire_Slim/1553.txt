The better to hear you with, my dearBy Lili Ladaga | The Newsroom – 3 hrs agoThe wolf from Red Riding Hood has nothing on a pooch named Harbor: Each of the black-and-tan coonhound's floppy ears is at least a foot long.
His left ear measures in at 12.25 inches, while the right is 13.5 inches long. Not only is Harbor able to hear a pin drop from a mile away, he can easily hear all the applause for his new title: The Guinness World Record holder of the "longest ears on a living dog."

But here in the U.S., getting past security with a bag of baby animals is a little harder. Heck, it's hard to get past TSA even if you ARE a baby. The next reasonable smuggling solution? Your pants!
In Miami, eagle-eyed TSA agents busted a man with snakes and turtles in his pants. (One can assume they were not in his pockets.) His answer when asked why he had seven snakes and three turtles in his pants? "That's all I had room for." (Ba dum chhh! He'll be here all week! Don't forget to tip your waitress!)

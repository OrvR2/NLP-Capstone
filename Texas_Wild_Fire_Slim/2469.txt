When a Christian publisher happened to come across a beautiful photograph by Shane Gavin, aka Roomic Cube on Flickr, they were clearly struck by the spiritual power of the image. Of course, it didn't occur to them that there might be something about it that didn't totally gel with the tenets of their faith. The full story is below in convenient picture form.

				You people are good at lumping things together.  You people complain about intoleranc­e and then go on to exercise intoleranc­e to the hilt.  Many spirtual and religious people understand the human condition better than "you" people know.  Why don't try reaching out to something higher instead of going low.

				Making fun of the homophobia within most (if not all) evangelica­l churches is not intoleranc­e.  It's sardonic, maybe smug, but hardly hateful.  No one is trying to deny legal equality to the religious.  However, when those same churches preach hate or lobby to deny equality to others, then that is indeed intoleranc­e.

				If you understand the human condition, then you all need to start speaking up a little bit more. A good Christian wouldn't let others be persecuted for such a long time and so openly. When more Christians start speaking up and out against open discrimina­tion against gay people, then we'll believe that you finally do understand the human condition.

This Is A Relief Rally- Not A Bull MarketBy Robert Lenzner | Forbes – Mon, Aug 1, 2011





Stock markets rallied as a form of relief from possible Armageddon. There will be no default and  at worst a rating reduction to the quite satisfactory AA+. Note that the preachers of doom in the form of interest rate spikes were wrong, dead wrong; The 10 year Treasury yield-- the most sensitive measure of the cost of borrowing money remains mired at 2.84%. Mired that is in cheapness. Mortgage rates will adjust reasonably. Banks will continue to coin profits from the steep yield curve.
We have officially entered the Age of Austerity. Less government spending. Cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, a means test for Social Security. But, we were dragged screaming and shouting there by this dreaded Tea Party movement that thinks its perfectly just NOT to tax rich people to pay for the deficit.
As for myself I guess when you look at the numbers- $2.5 trillion cut over 10 years--or $250 billion a year-- that's small potatoes-- less than 2% of GDP.  Not desperately unimaginably tough to handle.
Still, we have stained ourselves, again after the 2008 debacle when our excesses in the financial system almost did the world in. Now, we are still facing recuperation, meaning that everyone has to pay a bill for  an extended time-- maybe forever. Ain't no bull market to come of that.

No matter how you try to spin it, getting our fiscal house in order was still the correct move. Thankfully some of our folks were paying attention to Greece and those other socialized countries that are collapsing under the weigh of all the entitlements programs.

#$%$ "Bob"!  I guess I was confused again.     Foolish me, I just got a doctorate but forgot to get that MBA that renders me omniscient!

This congressional committee is more smoke and mirrors. These politicians are always trying to kick the can down the road to try and save their political careers.

What relief rally are you referring too. The markets are barely hanging on afetr a 600 point Obama induced market fall. The petulant one will be a "One term President".

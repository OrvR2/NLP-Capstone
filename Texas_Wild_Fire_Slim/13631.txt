BASTROP, Texas — Firefighters gained ground Wednesday against one of the most destructive wildfires in Texas history even as the state said the number of homes lost reached almost 800, and an elite search team set out to find any victims in the smoking ruins.
Gov. Rick Perry, meanwhile, resumed his presidential campaign after rushing home over the weekend to deal with the crisis, traveling to California to meet his Republican rivals in his first nationally televised debate.
The blaze has left at least two people dead, blackened about 45 square miles around Bastrop and cast a haze over Austin, 25 miles to the west, where the air smelled strongly of pine and cedar.
Firefighters reported that the flames were at least 30 percent contained after burning uncontrolled for three days. They credited an easing of the winds from Tropical Storm Lee that had caused the fire to explode over the weekend. Nevertheless, the number of homes that the Texas Forest Service reported destroyed rose from around 600 the day before.
The wildfire is the most catastrophic of more than 170 blazes that have erupted in the past week across the Lone Star State, which is perilously dry because of one of the state's most severe droughts on record. In addition to the two victims in the Bastrop area fire whose bodies were found Tuesday, the outbreak is blamed for two deaths elsewhere. A total of at 1,188 homes have been destroyed by wildfires in Texas in the last week, including the 800 lost in the Bastrop-area blaze, according to the Texas Forest Service.
One of the two people killed in the Bastrop-area fire was identified Wednesday as Michael Troy Farr, 49, who died at his home in Smithville. Bastrop County officials did not immediately release details about the second victim, who they said was found at a different location.
Texas Task Force 1, a search team that was sent to New York following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, set out in the Bastrop area using dogs trained to sniff out bodies.
Mike Fisher, the Bastrop County Emergency Operations Agency's incident commander, said he didn't know if there were any more dead, but "if there are bodies out there, that team is going to find them."
Several thousand people evacuated ahead of the fire, but only around 2,500 registered with the county.
 Across the state, about 1,200 firefighters battled the blazes, including crews from as far away as California and Oregon.
The outbreak has made this the state's costliest wildfire season on record, with $216 million in firefighting expenses since late 2010.
The crisis is unfolding months after Perry signed a budget that cut funding to the Texas Forest Service by one-third. Yet the agency insisted that being $35 million lighter hasn't left Texas less equipped to fight the latest fires.
Under the new budget, which went into effect last week, no firefighters in the Forest Service were laid off, and the bulk of cutbacks will be felt by volunteer fire departments that were denied money for new trucks, said Robbie Dewitt, the agency's finance officer.
Moreover, the Forest Service said it will spend whatever is necessary from state coffers to deal with the disaster and have the expenses accounted for later by state leaders.
However, the Fire Service does face some hurdles when it comes to resources.
A converted DC-10 jetliner from California that is capable of dropping 12,000 gallons of fire retardant arrived in Austin on Wednesday but won't be used until Friday morning because officials could not find a qualified pilot to fly it, Forest Service spokeswoman Holly Huffman said. The agency is facing competition for pilots from other states, particularly California, that are also fighting blazes, she said.
Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said Wednesday he would sign a request for the federal government to declare Texas a major disaster area. The White House later said President Barack Obama had telephoned Perry to make it clear the federal government will continue to provide assistance to state and local officials fighting the fire.
Obama also assured Perry that requests for additional assistance would be quickly assessed.
At the Bastrop convention center, residents streamed in to check maps taped to the pillars that showed the destruction.
Faye Tucker said she could tell just by looking at the map that her home of 20 years was gone, even though it wasn't among the addresses listed as destroyed. She and her husband had recently spent $20,000 to renovate the place.
"It's just stuff. I think that the thing to keep in mind here is so far we only have two confirmed deaths. ... So I'll take that," she said.
Perry returned to the campaign after cutting short a visit to South Carolina on Sunday.
"I'm a little disappointed after what he said the other day about pushing politics aside because Texans are his first priority," said Guylaine Williett, who lives near an area that was severely burned. "Now he's out on the campaign trail when us Texans are here in need."
Veteran GOP analyst Alex Castellanos said three days on the ground coordinating state efforts was long enough.
"The public understands his job is to be governor, not fireman," said Castellanos, who worked on President George W. Bush's re-election campaign and more recently worked for Perry opponent Mitt Romney. "Americans know he can meet both his responsibilities as governor and as a Republican candidate."
Before Wednesday night's debate, Perry discussed the fires while chatting backstage with some of his fellow candidates. Herman Cain and then Mitt Romney asked the governor how Texas was faring.
"Have they been brought under control?" Romney asked, talking across the room to Perry.
"It's still too early to tell," Perry responded. "They're serious, they're mean."

				For those of you who do not get it, let me make this analogy for you...You go to work, you go to pick up your paycheck, cause you worked hard for that paycheck, your employer tells you sorry I know its your money, but I feel like I know better than you how to spend it..Ms. suzy over in bay one needs the money more than you this week...tha­nks for your hard work..come back next week and keep working..I will keep on taking your money and hopefully you will see some of it soon..Now I know that is a bit of a stretch..b­ut the FEDS take my tax dollars, because yes I have a job..then decide who best to send MY money too..And you Libs are screaming while peoples homes are burning..n­o FED money for TX...Guess what ..its actually our money...

				Having read  the comments especially from Texas with great interest as the clown resides in a heavily wooded area in North Texas, one of the reasons these fires start has to do with Texas ATTITUDE of that of their citizens and their law enforcemen­t.

The reason the vast majority of these fires ORIGINATE is three-fold­.

• Human carelessne­ss
• Human criminal negligence
• And arson

The fact is Texans in general have a very lackadaisi­cal and strange apologetic attitude towards fires especially during a record drought and sustained record high temperatur­es. One can read it here in many of the comments.

If you reside in Texas it is not uncommon to see lit cigarettes flipped from vehicles, unattended trash fires, chains dangling on the pavement behind many types of vehicles, constructi­on using welding or grinding next to brushy areas, the list goes on.

Hopefully, these fires will prompt those living Texas to become far more mature and attentive regarding fires in general?

				You are correct but Texans will not change their behavior. Even the man in the article is blaming others and taking no personal responsibi­lity. I came back from vacation Monday and have several tubs filled with personal belongings and food and pet supplies. If the time comes I have to eveacuate I will have 2 weeks supplies of everything and my insurance agent has video of my house and yard.

				"The conservati­ve Republican (Perry) said he expects federal assistance with the wildfires.­..  [R]esident­s ...  lashed out at state and local officials and said federal emergency management officials should have been brought in sooner."  Seriously? It sickens me how people demand for themselves what they deny to others.

Look,  I am truly sorry for each and every person who has lost property, livestock or heaven forbid, loved ones to these fires. But isn't it the height of hypocrisy, Texas and Mr. Perry, to demand that the Federal Government­, you know the one, the Christ-hat­ing, immigrant loving, American-h­ating, taxes raising LIBERAL GOVERNMENT step in and bail you out of your problem? 

I read all about how FEMA just CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP BAILING PEOPLE OUT  when the problems  from Hurricane Irene were an issue, but that was when the devastatio­n was confined to the East Coast, right? .THIS situation is completely different. Hey, take your own advice that you so freely give to the unemployed­, to the victims of Irene, to poor public school children, to the elderly and the chronicall­y ill and don't turn to me, the taxpayer, to bail you out.

				This is a story about the fires and their devastatio­n.  There is a story in politics about Perry in relation to the wildfires.  Maybe that is a more appropriat­e thread for these kinds of comments?  Being a Democrat, I understand where you are coming from; however, many people who agree with you politicall­y are also devastated by these fires.  Texas is an amalgam of people. I disagree with painting everyone with the same broad brush.

				They shouldn't get any Federal help at all. We're broke, government­'s bad, etc. I'm sure you know all the reasons by now. I've been hearing them for two years now.

So which is it? Do you want to suck on the government teat or not?

				Now the man who cut funding for volunteer fire department­s that make up approximat­ely 90% of Texas' fire units from $30 million to $7 million dollars, or slightly more than 74%, Gov. Rick Perry,
wants to be president. Maybe he can choose Eric Cantor, who wants to pay for disaster relief with cuts in Social Security and Medicare, as his running mate. There they will be, standing over the charred, inundated, parched and starving remains of the country they mean to run into the ground. I can see it now: They'll appoint G.W. Bush and Dick Cheney to be travelling ambassador­s to go about poisoning all the remaining wells. Heck of a job, Rick and Eric!

				Mr Rick Perry - would you accept that climate change is one of the major reasons for wild fires that are devastatin­g your state? Climate change is real, sir and if Americans don't change their lifestyles and reduce their carbon footprint wildfires are going to continue. Do not blame God then. Blame man for his greed, lust, selfishnes­s, profiteeri­ng and what have you.  Mr Perry, become an environmen­talist and not an evangelist or better still  an environmen­tal evangelist­!

				Wild fires in Texas are probably the work of arsonists. Who knows? There are some weird people out there out to create havoc.  The dry season and the winds too have aided the fires to spread. These wild fires, natural or anthropoge­nic in origin, also contribute to global warming. Observe the tremendous amount of heat these wild fires generate. The atmosphere gets heated for many days and cause imbalance in the local weather. People of Texas must be more conscienti­ous of the delicate environmen­t and the ecosystem of the planet. They have to be cautious. Hikers, picnic groups and people who roam around the region for a lark  must be provided with ample knowledge  of wildfires and asked to be  cautious. Wildfires are disasters no state can afford to experience­. Has Perry ever thought of constituti­ng a disaster management team to fight wild fires, hurricanes and tornadoes that hit the state? It is time that Rick Perry change his attitude to environmen­t and prioritize the protection of the arid Texan environmen­t.

NOT TRUE.

				I heard a wildfire profession­al state that conditions are so dry that these fires are started by things that would not usually be of concern.  For instance, tow chain that is dragging the pavement can cause sparks.  Those sparks have started grass fires.  Anyone who leaves a vehicle running that is parked over grass can start a fire.

It is so dry that it takes very little for any of these fires to start.  Plus, it was reported that it was very windy on Monday.

WASHINGTON -- In Texas, firefighters aren't just battling the wild fires raging around Austin and Houston. The state's first responders have also had to deal with budget cuts affecting everything from fuel purchases to hoses and air tanks.
In some cases, fire officials say, firefighters have had to pay out of pocket for basic necessities like proper protective gear and fuel to get them to the scene. One fire department that battled the blazes in Bastrop County had to pay for a hose, recalled Bastrop City Fire Chief Henry Perry, speaking to The Huffington Post during a break from working the wild fires.
"That fire department has been on this fire every day," he said. "Before this fire, they were having to buy stuff out of their own pocket." Perry said he knows of at least one other department whose firemen had to pay for equipment maintenance and engine fuel.
Earlier this week, HuffPost reported that Gov. Rick Perry, the GOP front-runner for president, had signed off on millions in firefighting cuts as part of the state's most recent budget legislation. The Texas Forest Service's funding has gone from $117.7 million in the 2010-2011 budget years to $83 million in the 2012-2013 budget years.
Severe cuts have also hit assistance grants to volunteer fire departments throughout Texas. The grants decreased from $30 million per year in 2010 and 2011 to $13.5 million per year in 2012 and 2013. These are cuts that firemen are now dealing with.
"I don't agree with it. I understand what Governor Perry did," said Henry Perry (no relation). "Do I like it? No. I don't like it at all."
The cuts come at a time when Texas fire departments have already been slowing purchases of new fire trucks and other critical equipment as a way to save money, said Guy Turner, president of the Texas State Association of Fire Fighters. The association had endorsed Perry in his re-election for governor in 2010.
"What I fear will happen is equipment will start to fail and put our members at peril," Turner explained. "You can imagine if you're inside a structure fire and your engine quits."
Turner doesn't have to imagine it. He said he knows of firefighters whose breathing apparatus has malfunctioned during fires. There have also been "instances of hoses failing during the course of firefighting operations."
"For years, public safety was the golden calf -- that we were untouchable," Turner said. "Nobody's untouchable. It is a shame. They are basically putting a price on how much our lives are worth. It's disturbing at best."
Firefighters also have been hit with millions in cuts from a state matching grant program that helps local departments pay for essentials like proper clothing and engine upkeep. The departments already had difficulty matching the state grants. "These are the folks out there having to have fundraisers -- fish fries and pancake suppers and barbecues to raise money," Henry Perry said.
Chris Barron, executive director of the State Firemen's & Fire Marshals' Association of Texas, told HuffPost that one department in Bastrop County has had to beg for proper clothing to use in combating wild fires. Other firefighters have paid out of pocket for that gear. They can't wear their normal gear when battling these fires. "The last thing we want to do is wear something heavy and nonbreathable," he said.
Barron said his organization had started a wildfire relief fund in March with the goal of raising $500,000 for new gear. It has received $200,000 in private donations so far.
The budget cuts haven't just hit local departments in need of proper gear. They've hit the state agency charged with inspecting that gear. The Texas Commission on Fire Protection, which regulates and inspects the personal protective gear such as breathing apparatuses and protective clothing, took a 25 percent cut. The commission has gone from 41 to 31 employees. It's down to six inspectors covering 700 departments, including Houston's 4,000 firefighters.
"We lost personnel and we lost funding," said Jake Soteriou, the commission's executive director. He said he had not heard of the breathing gear malfunctions.
Will the budget cuts slow down the commission's inspections? "We're going to find out," said Soteriou.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said that firefighters were paying for "oxygen tanks," which is inaccurate. Firefighters carry air tanks, rather than compressed oxygen, to breathe in smoke-filled environments.

                        A few miles to the northwest of my home is burning, right now, the third largest wildfire in Texas, which, after several days, is now perhaps 65% contained.  The primarily Volunteer Fire Department­s, along with some help from a few area town department­s, struggled mightily to get a handle on this fire, but winds and 13% humidity made the fire race through the tree canopies above                        
                                                     Read More...
 even as they fought it at ground level.  It's been a conflagrat­ion that only turned around when fire department­s poured in from around the state, FEMA money brought in a DC-10 dumping fire retardant, helicopter­s came in dumping water, and community support helped set up a staging area with cots and hot meals and showers for the exhausted firefighte­rs who continue to work around the clock on this "Riley Road" fire. (Google it, if you want)Please click on this link to see a short article about this fire.  A big specialize­d DC-10 was sent to Bergstrom in Austin to help with the Texas fires.  Really notice the last paragraph:http://wil­dfiretoday­.com/2011/­09/09/map-­and-update­-on-the-ri­ley-road-f­ire-in-tex­as/The DC-10 Very Large Air Tanker, which carries 11,600 gallons of fire retardant, arrived at Austin, Tuesday night but it was not used on Wednesday or Thursday because the crew had to take two mandatory days off. During that time, a portable retardant plant was assembled so that the aircraft can reload at the Austin-Ber­gstrom Internatio­nal Airport. The plans are for the DC-10 to begin working on the fires Friday. There is only ONE CREW.  AS THE FIRES RAGE AROUND THE STATE, like at Bastrop near Austin and the one here near Houston, there is only ONE CREW.  They were required to hold off fighting the fire while homes and acreage burned, animals burned, citizens were displaced, because SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE has cut funding down to just the one crew.That's just absolutely ridiculous­.  You can read more athttp://wil­dfiretoday­.com/2011/­09/09/maff­s-air-tank­ers-activa­ted-only-o­ne-dc-10-l­eft/and more history about all this athttp://wil­dfiretoday­.com/2011/­09/09/air-­tanker-stu­dies/

				This article spells it out:
"State funding for volunteer fire department­s is taking a big hit. It is going from $30 million to $7 million. Those department­s are already facing financial strains."

"Most of the State of Texas is protected by volunteer department­s. There are 879 volunteer department­s compared to 114 paid department­s and 187 department­s that are a combinatio­n of both paid and volunteer firefighte­rs."

				The 24 Billion Dollars that Texas got from the "Failed" Stimulous plan ran out so there wasn't enough money to support Fire Fighting.   You would think that a State with the economic strength of Texas would fully fund public safety, but if you did you would be wrong.  Simply amazing.  Now you know about some of the priorities of Rick Perry.  If you want the USA to have the same priorities­, then vote for him.

				Yesterday I traveled from Bastrop to Houston. I saw the devastatio­n of the Lost Pines State Park. 

The Lost Pines forest of loblolly pines in central Texas are 100+ miles from other loblolly pines in the East Texas Piney Woods. Thus the name Lost Pines. It was a beautiful forest with a lake in the middle of the pines.The Lost Pines have been here for nearly a 100,000 years. To lose this forest is a tragedy in itself. For people that loved living amongst these pines it is even a greater tragedy. The other great thing about the Lost Pines is they are protected from the logging industry.

What I saw was many of the trees burnt down to a thin black stick.  Any structure amongst the trees or very close were completely burned down to the cement foundation­. However, the largest trees were still standing although they were dried out to a pale brown color. 

As I went on I saw some workers with big saws and cherry pickers bringing some of the larger trees down. They were then stacking 50 foot logs along the way. I couldn't be 100% sure but it look like these were people that worked for a logging company. Exactly one week after the fire  the vultures had arrived. In the future, look for large contributi­ons from the logging industry for Rick Perry and Lt. Governor David Dewhurst's run for the U. S. Senate. Crony capitalism at work as always in Texas.

				How sad! I am a person you could call a tree  huger .I love trees and flowers,i love nature.Eve­ry time i here about the destructio­n  in a very old place, with very old trees, it makes me heart sick.Trees that have stood for 1oo,ooo years , not just in Texas but all over.Destr­oyed in our lifetime, by people who refuse to protect the planet for many reasons, the main one being greed.Peop­le that care as much as i do, need to organize in every state to stop these, i can't post what i want to call them because HP would prevent it from going through.Le­t's just say, that i am so angry about the destructio­n and the loggers i could spit, which i never do unless it's tooth paste.  I am so sorry that the beautiful pines are gone, maybe when the earth heals a little, a group of caring Texans can replant trees,it's one way of trying to make the forest a better place for future generation­s.

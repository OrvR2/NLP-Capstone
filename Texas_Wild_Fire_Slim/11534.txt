NEW YORK (Reuters) - She has graced countless magazine covers and dresses sell out hours after she has worn them, but experts at New York Fashion Week say Britain's Kate Middleton is a style follower, not a trendsetter like her royal spouse's late mother Princess Diana.
Middleton has been compared and contrasted with Diana, whose style, charity and scandalous divorce from Prince Charles made her arguably the world's most famous woman.
When Middleton married Prince William in April, hundreds of millions of people around the world watched on television, eager to see the wedding dress designed by Sarah Burton for the British label Alexander McQueen.
Then during the a visit by the couple to Canada and the United States in July, all eyes were on Middleton's wardrobe.
"She is stylish, but she's not setting trends, she's following trends," said Gregg Andrews, a fashion director at U.S. department store chain Nordstrom.
"If you take Kate out of the royal family, put her on a street in New York, you wouldn't look at her twice. She's a beautiful woman, but she blends into a crowd," he said.
While experts debate her fashion status, they say there is no question that the new Duchess of Cambridge and wife of the person second in line to the British throne is influential.
"Is she a style icon of the likes of a Kate Moss? Absolutely not. Is she in the public eye? Are people going to become obsessed with everything she wears regardless of what it is? Yes," said Elle Fashion News Director Anne Slowey.
Much like U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, Middleton has been praised for wearing affordable Main Street labels.
A blue Issa crossover knee-length dress that she wore when her engagement to William was announced sold out within 24 hours and cheap knock-offs vanished almost instantly.
GREAT ROLE MODEL
And the cream "Nannette" gown by British fashion retailer Reiss, which Middleton wore in the official engagement portraits, sold out several times over.
"Is she iconic at the moment? Time will tell. She's certainly influential. In the position that she's in you can't be simply stunning as she is and not have influence," said Neiman Marcus Fashion Director Ken Downing.
While more polished lady-like looks have been shown at New York Fashion Week -- such as evening wear with sleeves -- some experts were not expecting to see many styles on the runway inspired by Middleton.
Almost 100 designers are showing collections for spring/summer 2012 to retail buyers, media and celebrities, with dozens more showing at other venues around the city to coincide with the semi-annual event, which ends on Thursday.Click photo to view more images. (Reuters/Phil Noble)
Saks Fifth Avenue Senior Fashion Director Colleen Sherin said Middleton's style could be aspirational for many women.
"She seems to be starting to experiment a bit, to try some different looks and some different designers which I like to see but also still remaining thoughtful and appropriate in her choices and that's the key to her success," she said.
Jill Martin, author of "I Have Nothing to Wear!", described Middleton's style as classic. "I think this spring you will see many brides walking down the aisle in dresses with sleeves and that will pay tribute to Kate," she said.

Whatever...

Don't think Kate will be too worried about what department store heads have to say about her wardrobe.  Given the fact that they are actually watching their spending over there due to their economy, unlike the talking heads here, and Kate isn't spending ridiculous amounts on gowns, designers to clothe her, well you get the pic.  Pretty ignorant statements in this article.  My opinion.

A trend setter is someone that initiates or popularizes a trend or new fashion.  If the clothing that she wears when she goes out into public fly off the shelves or sell out over and over again after she is spotted wearing them, then she is a trend setter.  If "cheap" knock offs are made right after she is seen wearing them, and they sell out, too...she is a trend setter.  These high fashion snobs that call themselves "experts" just don't want to admit that no one was paying any attention to those overpriced fashions until Kate stepped out on to the street wearing them.

How old and how educated are these people that write for Yahoo? Kate excudes polish and style....I think the author is confused about what a trendsetter actually does. Perhaps Kates' "trend" is well-fitting, classic clothing that highlights her best features. Dianna might have worn a series of "trendy" little haircuts for her time, but she was never tacky or following wardrobe planners from shows comparable to Jersey Shore.

I am from Iran and I absolutely love her. I think she has a great sense of style and grace. The conservative chic look never goes out of fashion. In Iran we love her style and she even looks quite Iranian herself. Kate is setting trends to look like a lady rather than alternative which everyone tries to do. I saw her in Peter Jones and she stood right next to me, I wanted to give her a big cuddle but it would have been rather inappropriate.

JENNY ANISTON ain't no trend-setter either.  And neither are Lindsey Lohan or Katy Holmes for that matter.  But so?  So what?  People who seek "trend-setters" are sheep. Design and wear your own stuff already!

It is a shame that poor Kate has to wear beautiful clothes that make her look gorgeous instead of that fashion crap on the New York runway that make those emaciated ghouls look like clowns. Kate is leading the world in fashion (God forbid she wears the same dress twice) with clothes that would make most women look beautiful. You go Kate.

Has anyone seen some of the garbage these so called experts parade up and down their cat walks.  Just because there are sheep that will buy anything they tell them to, doesn't mean they know what actually looks good.

No kidding.  I am not a fashion expert and I have been saying this ever since her disappointingly ordinary wedding gown.  Say what you want about Di, but she was a trendsetter.

NY fashion experts have no taste in clothing anyway. Most of their designs are ugly and disgusting and I wouldn't spend 1 penny on them. Princess Kate doesn't need to be a trendsetter. She's beautiful and anything she wears looks great on her. Instead of being a trendsetter, she shows how classic is acceptable at any time and never gets old or tiring. What looks good today will still look good in 20 years. That's the type of clothing I want to buy. I don't want to buy something today that's out of fashion next year. I can't afford to spend that type of money on clothing all the time. Do the fashion experts want all of us to look like Lady Gag Gag? No thank you. Even as beautiful as Jennifer Lopez is, her clothing is sometimes ridiculous. I want classy clothing I can wear everyday to work, church, weddings and for fun. I'd choose clothing such as Princess Kate wears anytime over almost anybody else's choices. I'd rather  have her classy look than the tramp slut look most models and trendsetters have today.

My best friend ,she just has announced her wedding with a millionaire man! They met via SearchⱤichṢingles.CȯṀ ..it is the largest and best club for millionaires and their admirers to chat online. …You do not have to be rich or famous, but you may meet one. It's worth a try!

Chase now i understand why people are so hard on you.   Some of your articles are ok but the content of this one is horrible.   Your trying to tell me that email is bad for business transactions.   Geez you better get the word out in a hurry cause its done everyday.   The NFL is a buisness and this guy is a product.   Your trying to say it would've been better for him to 'tweet it' than for the team to email everyone.   This article is a joke, cmon you can do better than this.

This article simply goes to show that "NY fashion experts" have no idea what they're talking about.  Does anyone care what  "fashion experts" think anyway?  Really?  Shut up already.

Maybe you wanna ch'eck it out or tell your friends.
What makes these people experts? Some of the styles you endorses are positively fugly. Kate may not be a trend setter, but she has grace, style and Prince William to boot. I will love to be a style follower like her. Show me your Prince or Princess, you haters.

@Talinthis i got an idea, what if,﻿ in the future, WE create a star so large and so unstable, we send this star into the past (somehow) and there you go, the big bang! that might be it!

@Talinthis well, when i was a kid,﻿ i thought that if you found the edge of the universe, you'd be gone forever, and every one would think you never existed :P who knows?

@sefbrodz
i dunno i find it hard to believe it just goes on forever, that means no matter how infinitely far you go in any direction, there is always some sort of matter or space... but then again, i also find it hard to believe that all of a sudden oh, theres the end.. like the edge of a cliff.. it blows my mind and i wish someone could tell﻿ me exactly what i want to know! :P

@JonoGreene i think i can answer how space goes on forever, i think of﻿ space as a sphere, it expands and contracts, or it grows and shrinks. it's a cycle that goes on FOREVER!
(i love studying the universe) :)

Al Jazeera journalist not allowed to film at Texas high school football gameBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Upshot – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

Eilzondo in Booker (Al Jazeera)
Gabriel Elizondo, a Brazil-based correspondent for Al Jazeera, is in the middle of a road trip across the United States, talking to people about the effects of 9/11 on American life. In Texas, Elizondo says he just experienced part of the impact firsthand.
"Ten miles," he wrote Sunday in a blog post. "That's how deep I got into Texas before being asked to leave."
On Friday, Elizondo says, he decided to stop at a high school football game in Booker, Texas, near the Oklahoma border. "What better a setting to immerse one's self into Texas rural life than high school football," he wrote. "I easily imagine sitting in the bleachers, eating a hot dog (or three) and drinking a Coke, talking football (the American kind) with parents and maybe slipping in a little 9/11 if they allow me. It's a no brainer for me. I love this stuff. I'll take this over sitting in a White House press briefing any day of the week."
But after Elizondo introduced himself as a member of Al Jazeera to Booker High's principal, a warm Texas welcome apparently turned cold.
"I don't think anything can wipe that double-wide smile off Mrs. Yauck's face," he wrote. "But my Al Jazeera business card does the job pretty quick."
More from the post:
"So you're from Al Jazeera," Mrs. Yauck says in a sharp tone, still looking down at my card. Looking up at me, she adds quickly, " So what's your spin on this story?"
"I don't have a spin," I say, still smiling to try to ease any sudden tension. "What I told you is exactly what I want to do. Just talk to people, film a bit. That is it. Nothing more. Nothing less."
"But you're with Al Jazeera?"
"Yes," I say proudly, still smiling.
But Mrs. Yauck is again staring down at my business card.
"Our superintendent is here, let me just go talk to him and I'll be right back."
According to Elizondo, the superintendent, Michael Lee, said, "I think it was damn rotten what they did."
"I am sorry, what who did?" I say, not sure exactly if he was calling me rotten, the terrorists rotten, Al Jazeera rotten, or all of the above.
"The people that did this to us," he says back to me with a smirk, still glaring uncomfortably straight at my eyes.
"Well, I think it was bad too," I say. "Well, do you think, sir, we can film a bit of the game and talk to some people here about just that?"
"No. You can't film, you can't take pictures, or interview people."
"OK, can I ask why? And if you allow me can I explain …"
Cut off.
"No, I just expect that you will respect it."
Elizondo says he respected the superintendent's wishes, and left.
I guess I could have snuck back in and secretly filmed with my Blackberry. I could have went back in with a camera rolling and confronted Mr Lee, which would have certainly got the classic shot of him putting his hand in front of the lens of the camera and likely provoked him to call the local sheriff. It would have turned into the largest scandal Booker had likely ever seen. But I quickly decide against it, not wanting to make a mockery of 9/11 just for a cheap TV confrontation trick. That was not my objective going in, and wouldn't be my objective now.
"I want to apologize to you if I came across as disrespectful," Lee wrote in a response on the high school's website. "That certainly was not my intent and is definitely not how I want to represent my community. I do say this with all sincerity."
"I was dealing with several situations in the few minutes prior to the start of the football game, my conversation with you being one," Lee continued. "The most important situation was the fact that two of our elementary children had not arrived at their home. I can assure you that two kids missing is very stressful for an administrator."
But Lee disputed Elizondo's account of the conversation. "You asked me a question about 9/11," he wrote. "I responded to your question. I did not use profanity in my response as indicated in the blog. I do not recall you writing any comments down and verifying them."
More from Lee:
I tried finding you after our other situations were resolved and talk with you more. [...] I would not have changed my mind about allowing you to just drop by and interview people and film our students. We did not have prior notice and we certainly did not have time to verify who you were. Also, I would have asked you not to do those things at a public event, on public property and at a public school function. If you had done these, then the FERPA rights for our students would very well have been violated, especially for the students whose parents have signed papers not allowing the pictures of their children on the web. I do regret however, that you did not return to talk to me more, or "confront" me as you stated in your blog. I think we would have enjoyed a nice conversation. Booker is a community that has accepted diversity for decades, including many different faiths. I am sitting here listening to the music from our annual "Fiesta Night" that celebrates the unification of the many cultures that make up our community.

"Eating hotdogs"?  Is he making a joke there? I know Muslims can not eat hot dogs.

It looks like to me to be a great misunderstanding. Mr. Elizondo should have given the Booker enough notice that he was interested in visiting their football game, so they can make sure the FERPA-protected children would not be filmed, and Mr. Lee's attitude came across to Mr. Elizondo wrongly. I hope this would help all of us understand what has gone on after 9/11, and I hope that Booker and Al Jezeera can get together for a future home football game with Mr. Elizondo filming his doc.

Al Jazeera can evaluate the 9/11 effect by watching American TV.  He has no reason to show up at an American High School to report and film events without proper verification and consent to do so.

Guess what, Al.  You have never shown beheadings, but somehow got that reputation.  Ever wonder why?  Maybe do a series on why you are hated by the US and admit the arabs might be a tad at fault too.

And Slappy the Horse is the South end of a North Bound Jackass. Good Job Mr. Lee. I assure you he will recieve the same response and welcome here in Oklahoma. Hopefully he went East or West and not north.

I agree, Mr lee do not say your sorry.  Im sure if this person did sneak back into the game the good people of Texas would has show waht all of rural american would show.  A swift kick in the Al Jazeera back side.  So you got off easy, just remember that.  Do'nt start No trouble, wo'nt get no trouble...Remember Al Jazeera...

Any person requesting to film anything at a school has to have prior authorization and the film reviewed by the district to ensure proper representation of the students.  It does not matter who it is.  All parents sign media release consents at registration and can opt not to have their children in the media.  Many of these children's safety is at risk.  Those parents are notified when someone is filming or publicizing anything at the school and the school has to ensure those children do not end up on camera.  A parent filming a game is different than a reporter publicizing children against their parents wishes.

Al Jazeera is the poster child of yellow journalism. When 9/11 happened, Al Jazeera immediately publicized it could not have been Bin Laden. They even published a story that 9/11 was a conspiracy involving the Jewish community. The same should go with any media an organization wished to ban when they are a threat (including Fox, CNN, MSNBC, etc.). Freedom of the Press also includes Freedom from the Press.

US Journalists should be banned from the rest of the world.  Americans do not understand it anyhow.  Most have never been outside Wal Mart.

For those of you who feel bad for this guy let's be serious he would have been treated much worse in any other country, so quit complaining, if you don't like how our country is than leave it. This journalist can " besa mi cu" that's Portugues for kiss my ass, that's right u hippie liberals there are immigrants who live in this awesome country and value it for what it is, so if u don't like that this idiot go told he wasn't welcomed too bad

I'll bet 10 to 1 AL Jazeera sent a Brazilian on purpose. Easier security clearance. 

i'll bet 8 to 1 that "higher ups" wanted this story to break exactly when it did, about 36 hours before RNC debate with Governor of Texas standing front and center. 

I'll bet 4 to 1 that the people supporting Al Jazeera either: A) felt badly for the terrorists who crashed the planes, because after all they were brainwashed, or B) have done ZERO research as to why this network shouldn't be allowed in this country. 

And I'll bet 1 to 1 and lose the vig that 97% of readers of this article failed to pick up on the "double wide smile" comment, CLEARLY showing this journalist did have a biased ax to grind.

Lets cut the PC crap. Having Al Jazeera at a Texas football game is like having MSNBC at a Texas football game. Its just un-American.

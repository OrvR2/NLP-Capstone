Italy: UN plans Libya political/observer missionBy NICOLE WINFIELD - Associated Press | AP – 11 hrs ago





ROME (AP) — The United Nations is expected to help oversee Libyan elections and train local police with political and military missions that will help guide the country through its post-Gadhafi transition, Italy's foreign minister said Wednesday.Foreign Minister Franco Frattini briefed Parliament on the U.N.'s proposals, which were outlined by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a letter to Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi Aug. 30.Plans for Libya's political transition have gone into high gear amid claims by Libyan fighters that they have surrounded ousted leader Moammar Gadhafi, even though his exact whereabouts remain unknown.Frattini said that within a few weeks the entire opposition National Transitional Council would be transferred to Tripoli from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and would declare the creation of a transitory government.The aim of the U.N. political mission would be to help the NTC prepare, within eight months' time, for the election of a national assembly that would draft a constitution to be put before a popular referendum, he said.The U.N. would then help plan legislative and presidential elections, as outlined by the NTC's own "road map" for Libya's transition, he said.Frattini said the U.N. is also expected to recommend — once conditions on the ground permit — an unarmed military observer mission to monitor and train local police. U.N. political chief B. Lynn Pascoe has said there will be no U.N. peacekeeping troops in Libya, something the former rebels have ruled out.Frattini said that while the exact details haven't been worked out, any such force would be composed of military observers from Arab and African countries. But he all but ruled out forces from sub-Saharan Africa, noting that many Libyans today equate sub-Saharan Africans with the mercenaries used by Gadhafi to quash the rebellion.While such generalities are wrong, he said: "The balance that the United Nations will have to find will be difficult."Libya's next steps are expected to be discussed at a high-level meeting with Ban in New York on Sept. 20, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Frattini said.Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York on Wednesday that the Security Council is waiting for a briefing in the coming days by Ian Martin, the U.N. special representative for post-conflict planning in Libya.Based on his briefing and a report from Ban, council members would begin drafting a resolution that would "express the council's support and approval of the initial steps that the United Nations intends to take to put a presence on the ground in Libya," she said.She said the council would also look to revise the financial sanctions against Libya to free up assets frozen when Gadhafi's crackdown began.___Edith M. Lederer contributed to this report from the United Nations.

That's a polite way of saying the UN has to send ground troops to "facilitate" the transfer of LIbya's gold and oil into NATO control. Otherwise known as an Armed Robbery of Libya's resources, something the Libyan people will be furious over. NATO will need guns on the ground to stop Libyans from fighting back.

If they can do this without American troops it will be the first time in history.  Obama is sure to put in our people so they can start getting picked off, even though he promised "no boots on the ground".  Can anyone actually think that the UN can allow unarmed observers to go into Libya without them being slaughtered?
When that happens, because of the insurgency that is sure to start, Obama will announce that we are forced to put in troops to protect our interests.  Interests we never had before this summer, but now it will be a National Security issue worth spending billions of taxpayer funds.  Wait and see.  This is just a new way of sneaking into a war we don't need.
Who is Obama going to blame for this one?

There is something not right about this whole thing! Libya's funds were frozen around the globe because the country was in turmoil. What if you went to the bank to withdraw some funds and they told you that you couldn't because the government put a hold on all your funds. You ask them why and they tell you that your credit rating fell below 500 and now the government has to supervise your spending. That's right, this will soon happen in the United States. I'm telling you guys, I bet this has already been suggested! If the world governments will do this to a country, you don't stand a chance! What if Libya said no to the UN! Their accounts would remain frozen around the world and to make matters worse, they would be cut off from any imports or exports. You better start getting your credit right because government supervised spending is headed this way. It's the only way to effectively fix the debt problem in the U.S..

Shameless acts by NATO, UN, USA, UK, FRANCE, ITALY, RUSSIA AND CHINA. they are all involved in the whole unfair games that took place there and right b4 the eyes of the world a no fly zone turned into a NATO + rebel fly zone where many innocent bloods were spilt by bombs and not reported honestly by the controlled press. Now it is time to install a leader they can control. When would all these stop for goodness sake. Tomorrow there is a revenge or attack on the states the whole world would cry foul but here the world is numb cos its big bullies on board. No jobs, no improvement in economy yet our leaders enrich their pockets and then go to other nations to teach them about oppression cos as far as proofs shows, libya has been one of the healthiest economy in Africa and lets see what happens after the so call help for democracy. People are not just stupid, just lil or nothing one can do these days especially how Obama pushes some policies up our throats even when we clearly don't want it. Injustice is injustice no matter who does it!!!

This is excellent news. Real progress is being made to provide Lbyans with internal security through local police departments and legal institutions that Libyans will build themselves with assistance from the UN. This is precisely the way it should be done. Great work by the UN and the Italian Foreign Minister!

I don't see how they (UN) can hope to succeed. Islam must have some plan is place to usurp power in the UN or they will just play along until the timing is right. This is some kind of sick joke.

This so called humanitarian mission was a sham from the start.  How the UN went from a no-fly mandate to an actual attack mode is not surprising.  The mission all along was to take over and control another 3rd world country that the Europeans and US deemed necessary to "LIBERATE."  Right, liberate it of its natural resources.  COLONIALISM LIVES !!!!!

Libya is a good example of what can happen to a small soverign country with resources & wealth that is unable to defend.  Inevitably thieves show up - especially from the european continent to rob them blind.

@dpalumbo7 You can meet me at my reservation. The Oconaluftee village in Cherokee, NC.
Also, I'm told my heart is high in cholesterol﻿ and evil. Ironically enough, my heart isn't very heart-healthy.

@nbreyes20031 I don't mind it that much. Look through the comments. It's filled with death threats and insinuations of my sexual preference, but it doesn't bother me because it's people hiding behind the anonymity of the internet.
Ultimatly, using vulgar language or nine exclamation points doesn't prove﻿ your opinion it just makes you lose credibility.
My view was that this video made fun of the hip hop community for making up superfluous idioms more than the Native American community.

Cont- and the man STILL looks back at the camera repeatedly
Now this video was obviously made to be taken lightly
But since we have not seen that,
You all criticize what you SEE
NOT what you look﻿ closely at.

The thing I find odd is that I see everyone commenting and criticizing the fact that it was either racist or offensive or just bad because they used modern music
U all say how dare u disgrace our﻿ traditions
One fails to realize that their 'traditions'
Are being video taped
How traditional is a 'rain' dance that's being video taped? HOW TRADITIONAL??!!
and one also fails to realize that the man in front is so busy staring at the camera that the second man overtakes him/his place in the dance.

Im not even a Native American and this is a disgrace, why parodize and shame the beauty and traditions if the culture. ﻿ Pride is something people hold close at heart, I am sure you'd see that if someone did the same of your culture.

John Mayberry’s Agent Tries to Net Him a Date with a Mermaid from “Pirates of the Caribbean”By Yahoo! Local | Local Philadelphia – 11 hrs ago

Erin Wright, Y! Philadelphia editor
That old phrase "Have your people call my people" has taken on a whole new meaning when it comes to one member of the Phillies team.
John Mayberry Jr., who has been a hit on the field, is looking to extend his winning streak -- at least when it comes to romance. According to an article in the New York Post, the outfielder is reportedly smitten with actress Antoinette Nikprelaj, who recently did a turn as a sexy mermaid in the latest installment of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie franchise.
The 27-year-old slugger isn't calling up the stunning actress, however, and asking for dinner and a movie. It seems he's outsourced that job,  relying on his agents to make the introductions and possibly facilitate a meeting. The Post said it obtained e-mails written by an agent in the baseball division of Creative Artists Agency -- the firm that reps Mayberry -- that were sent on to Innovative Artists, the agency representing Nikprelaj.
If the e-mail quoted in the article is any indication, the agent wasn't too happy in the role of pseudo-Cupid:
"I hate to even be sending you this e-mail, and I'm quite embarrassed to say the least, but we have a young client on the Philadelphia Phillies who asked us if we knew any agents at Innovative Artists and could connect him to Antoinette Nikprelaj.
"I know you're not a dating or set-up service, but John Mayberry Jr. (Phillies OF) would love to meet Antoinette or invite her to a baseball game sometime. Would this be possible?"
A bio of Mayberry, in which his Stanford education featured highly, was reportedly also sent to Innovative Artists.
No word on how -- or if -- the agent's inquiry was received, but looks like it may be a moot point, anyway. Seems the lovely Ms. Nikprelaj is married with a daughter. Maybe she has a single sister?

well if he has to go thru others to make a date then he's going about it the wrong way, you do it yourself......give a first impression in person.......not because you are a celebrity with a maid service to do your bidding...........all he's doing is copying what some people did asking celebrities on a date via the internet.........its so impersonable!!!!!!!!

Be an adult. Find out if she's in a relationship and if she's available then go from there (yourself- not your agent or her agent). What did you think she would do - throw her life away at the chance to meet you and your enormous ego?

TOTAL horse-hockey . . . This is one of the most down-to-earth, well-rounded individual you'd ever want to meet.  I'd be amazed if this didn't start out as him mentioning her as someone he'd like to meet (who wouldn't?) and then BAM! a Yahoo! reporter-wannabe decides that this is where he'll earn his $15 for the week . . . by writing this non-story and passing it off as an "item".  Really.

I think Mayberry just desperately wanted to know her, but he doesn't know anyway to get into touch with her. What he did, well, was kind of a little bit unprofessional, but he is a single young guy and you cannot blame him for trying!

This isn't a racial issue at all. Why do some of these comments suggest that? It's scary, honestly, that people can use such derogatory terminology so easily & freely.

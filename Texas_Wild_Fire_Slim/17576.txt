Texas WildfireSeptember 7th, 2011
As reported on myfoxhouston.com, a Bastrop fire claims two lives. 



Bastrop Fire Claims Two LivesThe wildfire has burned more than 34,000 acres, 600 homes and claimed two lives in Bastrop area. Officials have shared that the fire, which has required assistance from dozens of firefighting units - a total of 366 firefighters - from across the state, could be days from containment.
Over 5,000 residents have been displaced from 20 subdivisions. Residents in the Hobbs Creek subdivision have also been evacuated. County officials set up shelters for those that were evacuated at: 
Bastrop Middle School Ascension Catholic Church Bastrop Christian Outreach Center Smithville Recreation Center Elgin Family Worship
County officials held a press conference Monday morning and said the fire is too dangerous to be fought from the ground.  They first had to fight the fire from the air using planes and helicopters including Black Hawk helicopters.  There have been 250 fire crews that have worked on fighting the fire.  Fire officials expect the fire will take several days to contain.  
Additionally, a second wildfire broke out near Union Chapel last night, and has consumed nearly 1,000 acres and 27 homes. Another 100-150 homes remain threatened by that blaze. That fire is 15 percent contained.
Due to the continuation of the wildfires in Bastrop County, Bastrop ISD officials have made the decision to cancel school throughout the week. They are looking to reopen on Monday. All school related activities have also been canceled. This includes all athletic events and all extra-curricular activities.
Several Roads have been closed as a result of the fire.  Highway 21 between Bastrop and Smithville and from Bastrop to 290 is closed.  FM 1441 between Highway 95 and Highway 21 is also closed.
Bluebonnet Power has had to cut electricity to many homes in the area as firefighters worked to fight the fire.  Many homes that are not being threatened by the fire might lose power. 
Additionally, there is a boil water notice for parts of Bastrop.  
There are no reports of injuries at this time.
Texas Task Force 1, the state's elite search team, was deployed Tuesday to assist local officials and first responders here. Authorities said more state and federal resources have started to come in which will help, but at this point, the fire has still not been contained at all.
Bastrop County Residents are asked to call either 512-332-8856 or 512-332-8814 to get information about the fire and when they will be allowed back into their homes.
There will be two Legal Clinics set up starting at 9 a.m. on Wednesday for tho0es citizens who need legal advice. The clinics will be held at Ascension Catholic Church and Bastrop Middle School.
Also, Health and Human Services will have a mobile unit at the Bastrop Convention Center.
The fire originally began in the Circle D neighborhood on Sunday around 2:00 p.m. The wind blew a second fire off of 290 to join that one. The fire has forced evacuations in Tahitian Village and Pine Forest.

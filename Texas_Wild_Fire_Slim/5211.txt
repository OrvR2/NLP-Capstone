The BIGGEST fraud played in American history has been this idiot name Obama!  What exactly has he truly done?  He cannot run a business let alone a nation.  We are more socialist today than when he became president.  He is a shame to the US Presidency to US History.  No one says anything bad about the idiot because he be black, even those he is half white.

Some of you half-brains can you please go back to using your fingers for what you've been using them?   Your vibrator is out of batteries then try it manually, hence, using your fingers for something other than scribbling here.

I sit here reading some of the comments and I cannot but help thinking, "What a waste of taxpayer's money.  These people have learned nothing from 9/11."   Granted, Pres. Bush was not the greatest US President but 9/11 is not about Bush it was about America under attack.   Can some of you FOREST GUMPS grasp this concept????

The Bozo Bush need to be arrested for crimes of war, along with Cheney and the others in his group.  It is deplorable to see him hamming it up for the camera.  He makes me sick.

at least we HAD a president with a heart, a head, a soul and compassion.....Since then, all those characteristics of a president have gone up in smoke too.

Sarab.....I'm sad for you, not only for your atrocious spelling but, for your head full of mis- information.  Frankly if I was a black president in charge of that country..there wouldn't be enough security in the world to make me feel safe.

George Bush could NOT protect American people from terorist. LOOK at THIS, September 11 ATTACT came when BUSH was president. He spent money for IRAK & AFGANISTAN for ZERO Result. WMD NEVER be found and He could NOT Find & Kill Bin Ladin. 
Bush flew onto that aircraft carrier with that big banner MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!! but in reality the only one who accomplished anything was Bin Laden and we are still there. 
Bush & Cheney used SCARE TACTIC to american people.
BUSH made BIG DEBT & RECESSION for this country. He got SURPLUS when He was president from BILL Clinton. He ended with BIG DEFICIT for this country.

This goes out to Sarab with the very inventive little thumbnail he/she created for themselves on the comment posting site..don't you realize that what's wrong with your country is that there are people like you out there who find this sort of thing charming , witty, smart...
It's none of the above.

My question is this. Regardless of your feelings towards 9/11 or politics especially Bush someone explain how Obama has been so great? People bash Bush for reading they bash him for staying out of washington for a few hours yet when has Obama even been in washington let alone the white house other then "offical dinners" or other PR moments. When has he visited victims of attacks or even natural disasters? He travels with more security then bush did & his schedule's closely guarded by everyone especially the secret service so how is bush an more cowardly then Obamao? Even after 9/11 the bulk of the time Bush's location was known and reported on even before twitter he didnt need a special million dollar bus. Bash Bush but throw Obama in there to he's an even bigger coward then Bush was.

"I just wonder what health problems he now has being around the pollution of that dastardly act...committed by who knows who?" Recent photos of him look horrible! Just goes to prove that all the money in the world can't stop (the violence of) nature!"

Returning to the scene of the crime.

I wouldn't quote psychiatrists for 9/11 truth, psychiatrists are crazier than the patients.  Architects and engineers.

Do you think people that question the Government's explanation of 9/11 are crazy?

Well, the following psychiatrists and psychologists have concluded that the official version of 9/11 is false. Moreover, many of these mental health experts have concluded that the government's account is so obviously false that people who believe the government's version are in psychological denial:

Psychiatrist Carol S. Wolman, MD

Psychiatrist E. Martin Schotz

Professor of Psychology at University of New Hampshire William Woodward

Professor of Psychology at University of Essex Philip Cozzolino

Professor of Psychology at Goddard College Catherine Lowther

Professor Emeritus of Psychology at California Institute of Integral Studies Ralph Metzner

Professor of Psychology at Rhodes University Mike Earl-Taylor

Retired Professor of Psychology at Oxford University Graham Harris

Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of Nebraska and licensed Psychologist Ronald Feintech

Ph.D. Clinical Neuropsychologist Richard Welser

Clinical psychologist, Ed.D., Harvard University Gwendolyn Atwood,

Psychology researcher, M.A., Psychology Victoria Ashley

Psychotherapist, M.S. Clinical Psychology, Greg Henricks

M.S. in educational psychology, Roy Holcombe

M.A. in Counseling Psychology Tova Gabrielle

There are literally thousands of other mental health professionals who have reached the same conclusions. So who is out of touch with reality: those who question 9/11 or those who believe the government's version without question?

Talk about hate.  President Bush was in office for only eight months when 9/11 happend.  I can't believe this country has become so hateful.

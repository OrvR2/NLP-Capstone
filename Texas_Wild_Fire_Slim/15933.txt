Rick Perry has risked fanning the flames of criticism for his handling of the Texas wildfires by failing to show for a pre-arranged press conference.The Texas governor and Republican presidential nominee was scheduled to be in Bastrop on Saturday to see and talk about the latest on the huge blazes, which have torched 1,600 homes and killed four people.But he didn't turn up. 

No show: Texas Governor Rick Perry, pictured today during a memorial service at the Texas State Cemetery Twin Towers Monument in Austin, has drawn ire for failing to show for a press conference on Saturday
Mr Perry's office had sent out two advisories about his media availability. The second one gave a new location for the event because the first one would have had limited access.However, when the cameras started rolling at the second, confirmed location, which was a burned-out home and chocolate shop along the main highway, Mr Perry was not there.Local officials briefed the media on the fire situation in his absence.

Aides to the presidential candidate cited 'logistical issues', explaining that the change of location made it impossible for Mr Perry to get there in time.'We didn't want to hold y'all up,' staffer Allison Castle told the Houston Chronicle. 'Our intention was for him to be here.'Another Perry spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, told the Texas Tribune: 'By the time we nailed down a second location we wouldn’t be able to get the governor there in time without making everybody wait.'

Instead, Mr Perry stayed in Austin 
and did not travel to Bastrop at all. Staffers could not say exactly why
he was unable to make the 45-minute journey.His office added that officials at that press conference 'reiterated the same message that the governor would have delivered.'Mr
Perry, who has already come in for stick due to time spent on the 
campaign trail while there were fires burning in his state, was today at
a memorial service at the Texas State Cemetery Twin Towers Monument in 
Austin.Texas officials
say the number of homes destroyed by the massive wildfire raging east 
of Austin has risen to 1,554. They also say 17 people are unaccounted 
for.Bastrop County 
Sheriff Terry Pickering said today that the missing people could simply 
be out of town, but authorities have been unable to contact them.

County
emergency management director Mike Fisher says the number of homes 
destroyed is expected to rise further as officials enter more areas 
where the fire has been extinguished.
The
blaze in Bastrop erupted a week ago when blustering winds whipped up by
Tropical Storm Lee blew over parched, drought-stricken Texas. The fire 
is the largest of more than 190 raging throughout the state.
Yesterday,
tensions flared at a news conference when residents shouted at county 
officials and demanded to know when they could return to their homes - 
or find out what remains of them.'This is day seven, tensions are 
high'Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald
Fire
crews are making progress fighting the wildfire but concerns over 
smouldering hotspots have kept thousands of residents from returning 
home in the Bastrop area, 30 miles east of Austin.
At the conference yesterday, Bastrop 
County Judge Ronnie McDonald said officials hope to get people back as 
soon as possible, but he is not sure how long that will take. ‘This is 
day seven, tensions are high,’ he said.
After
spending nearly a week wondering whether his home had been destroyed in
the wildfires, George Gaydos got the news on Saturday that it had 
indeed burned down.

But Mr 
Gaydos - who has been living at a hotel with his wife, two children and 
father since fleeing the fires nearly a week ago - still cannot return 
to his neighbourhood to see what is left of his house.
A
perilous mix of hot temperatures, strong winds and a historic drought 
spawned the Bastrop-area fire - the largest of the nearly 190 wildfires 
the state forest service says have erupted this week. 
A 22,000-acre blaze straddling three 
rural counties about 40miles northwest of Houston has burned for several
days, destroying about 60 homes and forcing some people to evacuate. 'Everybody hang in there and we'll get you back home as soon as possible'Bastrop County Sheriff Terry Pickering
About half the fire was behind 
containment lines and no towns or cities were threatened. Most homes in 
the area are scattered in the forest, ranch-land and in small 
subdivision clusters.
In Bastrop, officials said the fire was about 50 per cent contained after almost a week of burning. 
Though
residents were anxious to get to their neighbourhoods, Bastrop County 
Sheriff Terry Pickering said authorities need to be certain they are 
safe before residents would be allowed back.

Doing their bit: The Lassen National Forest crew help fight the massive Texas wildfire but concerns about hotspots are keeping thousands of residents in the Bastrop area from returning home
Residents
from one 700-acre area that includes about two dozen homes were allowed
to return home, but other areas remained evacuated as crews tried to 
put out potentially dangerous hotspots.
‘Everybody hang in there and we'll get you back home as soon as possible,’ Mr Pickering said.'We haven't even hit our toughest area'Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald
Fire crews continued battling hot spots on Saturday, but didn't expect major wind gusts overnight.
However authorities also cautioned that the toll from the fires could get worse. 
Judge
McDonald said he expected the number of homes destroyed by the fire to 
increase from the current tally as more assessments are completed. 
A spokesman for the team of state, local and federal agencies also said it is expected to rise.
‘We haven't even hit our toughest area,’ Judge McDonald said on Saturday afternoon.
He added that teams haven't had a 
chance to go in and ‘count those houses or get a tally because of the 
amount of heat that's in the area’.

Smoking: A Lake Worth fire unit sprays an area where the fire had jumped Shelby Road in Rendon, Texas, as brush fires occupied numerous fire departments on Friday
In the meantime, residents are 
staying wherever they can - makeshift shelters at churches, friends' and
relatives' homes, even cars in nearby parking lots.
‘There are some who are actually 
picking out apartments,’ said Sean McGahan, pastor of New Beginnings 
Church in Bastrop. ‘If you haven't already started, you're probably 
behind the curve.’Next week, Mr Gaydos and his family will move into a mobile home in Bastrop while they decide whether to rebuild. Before
finding out Saturday on a fire department website that his home had 
been destroyed, Mr Gaydos spent much of the past week so worried about 
his home that he couldn't sleep.‘You wake up in the middle of the night and you can't go back to sleep,’ Mr Gaydos said. ‘I've been going to work early just because I'm already up.’‘There are some who are actually picking 
out apartments. If you haven't already started, you're probably behind the 
curve'Sean McGahan, pastor of New Beginnings Church in 
Bastrop
Governor Rick Perry's office said families whose homes have been destroyed will receive seven-day hotel vouchers from a non-profit organisation as well as assistance from the state.The vouchers were welcome relief for Russell Horn, who said the $104 nightly hotel bill for him, his wife and two boys had become too costly. The 32-year-old electrician said their home had been destroyed by the fire and he had only been able to get out wearing an undershirt and shorts.‘There aren't too many places you can go just wearing that,’ Mr Horn said. 

No go: Resident Ronnie Williams decides the fire that jumped Shelby Road is too much to put out with his feet and retreats as brush fires occupied multiple fire departments in Mansfield, Texas, on Friday
 

Relief: A plane drops fire retardant on Friday near a ranch off Cass County Road 1649 near Avinger, Texas
On Friday, White House officials announced that President Barack Obama had signed a federal disaster declaration for Texas. 'You wake up in the middle of the night 
and you can't go back to sleep. I've been going to 
work early just because I'm already up'George Gaydos
The move allows federal funding to be made available to individuals in Bastrop County. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs.Governor Perry unexpectedly cancelled plans on Saturday afternoon to visit areas hit by the Bastrop wildfire and hold a news conference because of ‘logistical issues’ with him arriving on time.But he was in Austin and keeping in regular contact with officials on the wildfires, a spokesman said.

The bigger distraction is the Feds getting their oar in & turning away firefighters from elsewhere in the state plus the fleet of gov't airborne water tankers is reduced by forty as the gov't cancelled the contract only weeks ago.

I live in Austin, Texas, which is about 25 miles from Austin - approx. 45 minutes by car, 10 minutes by helicopter! I call total BS on Governor Perry's inability to get to the changed location due to logistics. Bastrop is a very small community. Even if the press conference had been moved from one side of town to the other, it wouldn't have made him "late." If he had been late, the Bastrop survivors would not have cared; his support would have been invaluable. I agree with Abby1; Perry didn't want to be in the hot seat, as it were. 
This is an historic event and Perry has been to the site of the state's biggest fire one time in eight days. Meanwhile, he's been in California, South Carolina, and Florida. And the election is a year away? That ought to tell you where Rick Perry's priorities lie. 
Thanks for the article, Mail Online - great coverage and photos!

- completely average, somewhere, 12/9/2011 05:53******I recall reading a comment from you some months ago where you were bragging on the fact that your Governor had an extremely large surplus in the treasury. Why does Texas not use that money to help it's citizens in their time of need?

I have to say I have always found it odd that it is considered acceptable for a sitting governor to run for president. The people of Texas elected Perry to run the government of the state of Texas, not to use that office as political capital in a bid for the white house. If he is going to be spending the majority of his time over the next year running a campaign, then he should resign his office and allow his lieutenant governor to be sworn in as the full time governor so that somebody will be devoting their full attention to the affairs of the state.

I'm willing to bet that throwing lit cigarettes out of vehicles causes a lot of wild fires, and until the penalties for doing that are made severe, these acts and the fires that result, will continue.
- SwampFox, Palmetto, FL USA, 11/9/2011 19:00
------------------------- I'm willing to bet that they don't cause nearly as many fires as you think, at least not in Texas which requires "fire safe" cigarettes which self extinguish if you aren't actively puffing on them.

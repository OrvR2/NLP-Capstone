Kaiser gives $400,000 to Marin, Sonoma nonprofits
By Dan Verel, Business Journal Staff Reporter  Print Friendly
   

SANTA ROSA — Kaiser Permanente said it has given grants totaling $400,000 to 30 local nonprofits as a means of improving the health of communities in Marin and Sonoma counties.
“These grants will have a positive and significant impact on community health,” said Judy Coffey, senior vice president and manager for Kaiser Permanente’s Marin-Sonoma area. “Partnering with others is another way we help transform neighborhoods and communities into healthier places.”
A local needs assessment helped determine the priority areas for funding, prior to awarding the grants. This, according to Kaiser, allowed its community investment teams at the San Rafael and Santa Rosa medical centers to evaluate requests from a variety of local nonprofit organizations.
This year’s funding priorities for Kaiser include increasing access to health insurance coverage and health care services; decreasing excess weight and obesity; preventing alcohol, tobacco and other substance abuse; creating a sustainable safety net; fighting breast cancer; and improving oral health.
The funding range for each grant in Marin and Sonoma counties was $5,000 to $40,000.
Grant recipients include:

Agricultural Institute of Marin
Alliance Medical Center, which has locations in Windsor and Healdsburg
Bay Area Community Resources in Marin County
California Parenting Institute in Santa Rosa
Canal Alliance in San Rafael
Center for Domestic Peace in San Rafael
Coastal Health Alliance in West Marin County
Council on Aging Services for Seniors in Santa Rosa
Healdsburg Farm Market
Jewish Community Free Clinic in Rohnert Park
Jewish Family & Children’s Services
LIFT for Teens
Marin AIDS Project
Marin Bicycle Coalition
Marin Center for Independent Living

Sonoma County Department of Health Services

The grants are in addition to the recent $1 million Kaiser Permanente Healthy Eating Active Living grant to fight obesity in Santa Rosa.

Aug. 11, 2010 — COLLEGE STATION, Texas — The vast majority of forest owners would consider keeping their land forested if they got paid for doing so, according to a recently-released Texas Forest Service survey.The findings were part of the agency’s Environmental Credit Marketing Survey, which was sent last year to more than 5,100 landowners in an effort to gauge their interest in newly-emerging ecosystem services markets.The markets are designed to provide a monetary reward to landowners who maintain their forests and, as a result, provide society with public benefits such as clean air and water, wildlife habitats, carbon sequestration and even places to relax and play.Though they’re not yet fully developed, the markets one day could allow landowners to earn money for keeping their forests intact.“The goal was to gain a better understanding of landowner perspectives on ecosystem services markets, determine interest in these emerging markets, and identify potential participation barriers,” said Program Coordinator Hughes Simpson, noting the overwhelming 20 percent response rate. “I think we successfully did that.” Arguably the most notable finding was that the lion’s share of landowners — 82 percent of the more than 1,000 who returned the survey — would consider selling environmental credits. And many who said they likely wouldn’t participate still were interested in learning more about the markets.Of the landowners who were interested in selling environmental credits, several factors were found to have a significant positive influence: awareness of carbon credits, size of their property, current participation in cost-share programs, and ownership to generate income.“As expected, compensation is the biggest motivator,” Simpson said. “Land and management restrictions - primarily timber harvesting - were the greatest barriers to participation.”Among the more notable findings:•Seventy-five percent of landowners surveyed were knowledgeable about carbon markets, but not other ecosystem markets. •Eighty-five percent were interested in obtaining more information on the topic. •Eighty-two percent would consider selling environmental credits.It also is interesting to note that among the landowners who indicated they would not be interested in selling environmental credits; forty-four percent were still interested in learning more about ecosystem markets.“These results will help the agency develop additional educational materials, provide technical assistance to interested landowners, shape state and national policy regarding these markets and facilitate potential transactions, ultimately keeping forests in forests,” Simpson said.

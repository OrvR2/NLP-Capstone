      Quick Facts and Upcoming Events97.5% of Earth’s water is in the oceans and seas, 1.73% is frozen in glaciers and icecaps, 0.77% is freshwater resources (of which only 0.0008% is actually available and renewable freshwater). Source: USDA80% of freshwater resources originate on forestsThe current overall BMP implementation rate is 91.5%The Texas Forest Service BMP Program has prevented 91,520 tons of soil from eroding off East Texas forests and 12,387 tons of soil from reaching East Texas streams annually.Almost 3000 loggers have been trained in BMPs since 1995. Upcoming Events It is documented that well managed forests provide us with clean water. They also absorb rainfall, refill aquifers, slow and filter stormwater runoff, reduce floods, and provide habitat for fish and wildlife. Forestry operations, if done improperly, can negatively impact these benefits. Forestry Best Management Practices  (BMPs) were developed to prevent these impacts from occurring.Forestry BMPs are a set of guidelines that involve the application of conservation practices that effectively prevent or minimize the amount of nonpoint source pollution (NPS) generated during forestry operations. BMPs can include such measures as leaving a buffer zone of trees next to a stream, installing a culvert to cross a stream, or establishing grass on forest roads to prevent erosion.In 1989, the Texas Forest Service established the BMP program to focus on minimizing any threats to water quality from forestry activities. The program educates landowners, loggers and foresters about the threats to water quality and provides technical assistance on how to minimize those threats through the use of non-regulatory forestry BMPs.The BMP program also monitors BMP implementation throughout the state. Every three years, the BMP program publishes a report, Voluntary Implementation of Forestry Best Management Practices in East Texas, which describes the level at which BMPs are being implemented. The TFS has also conducted a study designed to measure the overall effectiveness of BMPs in Texas.

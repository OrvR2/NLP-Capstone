                     BASTROP, Texas -- Authorities say active flames from a massive Central Texas wildfire are behind containment lines and some residents evacuated from unburned areas can return to their homes. Smoldering hot spots remain across the 45 square miles blackened by the massive Bastrop County wildfire. But a spokesman for an interagency team assisting the Texas Forest Service says flames are inside the lines surrounding about 30 percent of the fire area. Rudy Evenson says Thursday' major concern is wind sparking more flames beyond those boundaries. Nearly 1,400 homes have been destroyed about 25 miles east of Austin and...

Armed Mexican Navy Chopper Invades Texas, Buzzes Homes

Rather Unfortunate, but it seems the Foreclosure Firestorm will only increase and compound itself throughout the summer. The Alt-A loans will be resetting also, so a large bulk of soon to be former homeowners will find themselves in Negative Equity in relationship to Loan to Value. An estimated 2.4 million homeowners will lose their homes, multiplied by spouse and kids, truly an exodus that would put the Israelites to shame in number.

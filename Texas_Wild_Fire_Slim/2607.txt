Kate Hudson's estranged father and Goldie Hawn's ex-husband, Bill Hudson, is spilling family secrets in his tell-all book "2 Versions: The Other Side of Fame and Family," to be released in November. 
Hawn married Bill Hudson in 1976 and they divorced four years later. Together, they had two children: Kate and Oliver, who is also an actor. 
According to RadarOnline who obtained a copy of Hudson's book, it promises to shed some light on Bill's strained relationship with his ex-wife and children. 
And Bill Hudson really doesn't seem to be holding anything back. RadarOnline reports that in his book, Bill accused Kate of not visiting or calling her dying grandmother, who is batting Alzheimers disease. 
In the book, Bill writes, "I love Kate, but ... She has done stuff which is just awful. She is a spoiled brat in my eyes and at the end of the day, she should meet her little sister. I should meet my grandchild and she should help her grandmother."
Uh Bill, shouldn't you want to meet your grandchildren? 
Kate gave birth to son Ryder in 2004 and just this past July, she and Matthew Bellamy welcomed their son Bingham to the world.

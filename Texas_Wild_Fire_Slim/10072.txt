NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. — Casting himself as America's CEO, Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney on Tuesday outlined a sweeping economic plan that would reduce regulations and taxes on companies, sanction China over its currency practices and weaken the clout of labor unions.
Trying to hold off surging rival Rick Perry, Romney traveled to economically suffering Nevada and stood inside a giant truck warehouse to deliver his multi-point plan designed to position him as the GOP contender with the most comprehensive approach to fixing the economy.
"This is a business plan for America," Romney told supporters as he promoted his plan as one designed to modernize an economy he says is still oriented toward earlier decades – and held up General Electric CEO Jack Welch and former Apple CEO Steve Jobs as "real deal" leaders in the U.S. economy.
It's a version of the economic pitch Romney has been making throughout the campaign so far – but it's now been sharpened to highlight how his private-sector record contrasts with Perry, the Texas governor, who has held elected office for more than two decades. In his speech Tuesday, Romney barely mentioned his own four years as governor of Massachusetts.
Perry's campaign sharply criticized Romney immediately after the address. "As governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney failed to create a pro-jobs environment," Perry spokesman Mark Miner said in a statement. When Romney was governor, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 in job creation.
Romney's plan calls for reducing or eliminating several taxes, extracting more U.S. oil, coal and natural gas, expanding trade pacts and slashing federal spending. His campaign distributed the 160-page booklet, and Romney explained it in an at-times rambling speech delivered without prepared text or a teleprompter.
Democrats called Romney's plan wrong-headed and doomed to fail. Taxes already are near historic lows, they noted, and many employers say weak consumer demand is more troubling than taxes or regulation.
Romney portrayed his plan as a bold vision to lower the nation's unemployment rate, now at 9.1 percent.
"America should be a job machine: jobs being created all the time, people looking for employees to join their enterprises," he said.
Many of his proposals are not new, although they could cause fierce debates in Congress if pursued. He would seek a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, cut non-security discretionary spending by 5 percent, eliminate the estate tax and undo the 2010 health care overhaul championed by President Barack Obama.
The jobs plan is Romney's first major policy statement since he announced his candidacy in June. It came two days ahead of Obama's scheduled speech on jobs before a joint session of Congress.
Romney's campaign predicted that his overall plan would lead to 4 percent annual growth in the U.S. economy, and create 11.5 million new jobs over four years. The campaign did not provide details of how it reached those projections, which are certain to be challenged by Democrats, independent groups and perhaps his GOP rivals.
Winning congressional approval for such proposals could prove difficult even if Republicans keep their House majority in the 2012 elections and take over the Senate. Senate Democrats would likely retain filibuster powers.
First, of course, Romney must win the Republican nomination, which eluded him in 2008. Many party insiders saw him as this year's early front-runner until Perry jumped in and shot to the top of polls.
Texas has gained many thousands of jobs during Perry's decade as governor, pressuring Romney and the other contenders to convince GOP voters they can do a better job of attacking unemployment.
Romney called for lowering the corporate income tax to 25 percent, from the current 35 percent. That rate is high compared to other advanced economies, but a host of tax breaks allow many U.S. companies to pay little or no corporate tax. Romney said a lower rate would encourage companies to keep more operations within the United States.
He would eliminate taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains for people making less than $200,000 a year. A campaign spokeswoman declined to offer estimates of the proposal's budget impact "because they are still being refined and finalized."
Most capital gains taxes are paid by the richest Americans, and Democrats said Romney's plan would have scant effect.
Romney said he would keep the Bush-era income tax cuts unchanged. Obama wants the cuts, which were set to expire this year, to disappear for the wealthiest taxpayers.
Romney did not go as far as GOP presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, who has called for lower tax rates for all Americans and the elimination of most tax breaks and loopholes.
Romney said he would consider wider changes to the tax code over time. He also said a number of foreign and domestic proposals would lead to job growth, the issue dominating the presidential election.
Saying Obama has greatly expanded federal regulations, he proposed steps to ensure that new regulations won't cost employers more money. If a new set of federal rules raises costs for businesses, his plan would require other regulations to be eliminated as an offset.
He said he would sanction China for deliberately keeping its currency low, which makes Chinese-made products easier to sell abroad. The Obama administration has complained about China's currency policy but has not made it a priority in the two nations' relations.
Romney also accused China of stealing intellectual property, a common complaint among U.S. creators of technology, entertainment media and other products. He proposed a "Reagan Economic Zone," which would be a coalition of nations that respect intellectual property rights and seek expanded trade with each other. And he vowed to push stalled trade pacts with Colombia, Panama and South Korea.
Focusing on labor unions, which overwhelmingly back Democrats in elections, Romney said he would seek rules making it easier to defeat unionization drives and to prevent mandatory withholding of union dues from workers.

                        An excellent plan to accelerate the race to the bottom and to further exacerbate the inequality problem we currently face.  Making it easier to defeat a union organizing drive?  How much easier can it get than what we have today - captive audience speeches, no meaningful penalties for threats, veiled or otherwise, employers firing employees who start drives knowing any ULP charge will take years

 to settle and the drive will lose steam by that point.  The only thing this will accomplish is to further increase the representa­tion gap and to further drive wages down and benefits out at a time when this country is in the middle of a demand crisis that is being driven by stagnating and declining wages.   Then refusing payroll deduction for union dues-  How exactly will this create jobs?  This is nothing more than an attempt to eliminate the duly elected representa­tives of workers - to cripple the employees attempts to engage in concerted activity after they have made the decision to do so.  Finally, giving further tax breaks to the Corporatio­ns and individual­s that are already taking more and more of the income and wealth in this country - quite a plan.  After all we know that the historic low effective tax rates of corporatio­ns, the historic low income tax rates on investment­s and the temporary eliminatio­n of the estate tax the first time created millions of jobs.

				Looney tunes, I love "visual aids" they can be made to reflect any point you want to stress. Even if its used correctly its misleading as is "Silver spoon" Romney is his speeches.  250+ million dollars and unemployed just like the middle class. He left out the word spend because there is no other way to get out of the Teapublica­n grave they have dug.

				I like the way he thinks. Less regulation­s and they would hire many more Americans. Get rid of the child labor laws. Lower the wages to compete against third world nations that our "Moral" People/Cor­porations would prefer to use. It would create millions of jobs. And god knows we will need them so a normal family can afford to feed themselves­. That's the new American Dream. A nice dry cardboard box and a little something in our children's bellies.

				The Obama administra­tion has had zero "jobs" plans since taking over, their so-called stimulus plan was a disaster, they have been unable to even put an approved budget together for over two years and continue to run at. 1.5 Trillion dollar annual deficit, has no plan to deal with the massive debt problem we have, has fumbled our foreign policies, continues to borrow and spend like drunken sailors, and has demonstrat­ed a level of incompeten­ce only worse, maybe, to the Carter administra­tion. All they do is harp about tax breaks for the rich as though rising their rates would solve the country's problems, which just shows how out of touch they are with the complexiti­es facing this country. All they can do is pick on Paul Ryan's plan, which many economists feel does not go far enough, or the Tea Party Americans who actually understand what is at stake in this country better then most Americans, and now, they can pick on Romney's job plan.  How about this? Let's compare the ideas from Romney against the jobs plan that Obama is going to announce in the President'­s speech tomorrow night. Romney has 59 ideas based on his business experience and let's see if Obama has anything new to offer. Most of us know that other then another stimulus (now called the "infrastru­cture bank") and the "Georgia Job Bank" idea which will have minimal impact on job creation, he is only going to talk in broad concept terms without any real

				While taking my regular Tuesday rountrip of 220 miles in order to teach a class - my job - I listened to Romney's speech on his economic plan.  He made a pitch for the 160 page book that laid out all 59 proposals for the economy but didn't seem to know if Amazon was charging for a Kindle download.  They weren't, so I read the whole plan last night.  If you are a child, a woman, poor, middle class, or elderly be prepared to suffer even more under the Romney plan.  We need a little history lesson here.  When Bush was president   1) June 2001 - tax cut for rich 2) 9/11 3) war in Afganistan 4) March 2003 war in Iraq   5) May 2003 - even bigger (1.3 trillion?) tax cut for the rich.  Convention­al wisdom says you don't cut taxes while waging a war and certainly not while waging two wars.  The same economic advisor who helped Bush fashion these plans is now the chief economic advisor to Romney.  Clearly nothing new here and certainly nothing that will help the middle class.

Now that the President is about to make a speech about jobs Mitt is basically running out to say he knows were the jobs are and how to get them, but his plan is one that has already been tried and failed, unless he is going to some how put all those people back to work that he helped layoff.

This week, May 2 to 6, is national Teacher Appreciation Week. It's a time to give thanks to this country's educators, who work hard for far less pay than their counterparts abroad.

With education budgets being cut across the country, teachers are under fire from every direction. Their resources are being cut and many of their jobs are threatened, yet they're given the responsibility to take us out of the education slump into which we've fallen.

This week, stop to show your appreciation for the hard work they do all year long. Here are a few suggestions for how to express your gratitude to your community's teachers.
If you have a great idea we haven't included, add it to the comments below or tweet it to @HuffPostEdu with the hashtag #thankateacher.

Nausheen Husain: The Importance Of Teaching Religion Well


		                        
																Most people who decide to leave their childhood religion say they did so before the age of 24. This makes it clear that the role of a religious education teacher is crucial in a young adult's life.                            

 






Kati Haycock: Teachers Deserve More Than a Week

Michelle Rhee: In Honor of Teacher Appreciation Week: Let's Show Our Thanks to Teachers by Elevating the Profession


							            							            Most teachers are evaluated inconsistently, going without the feedback and professional development that can help them excel. The need for change is basic and glaring. We need new evaluation systems that can strengthen the profession.							        



 






Leonie Haimson: Teachers, We Honor and Respect You!


							            							            It's teacher appreciation week; and in a letter in EdWeek published Monday, Arne Duncan attempts to convince teachers that his policies actually reflect respect towards their profession.							        



 






Paul Lamb: Appreciating Teachers: A Letter to Mrs. Hamilton

Brock Cohen: Three Things Teachers Want More Than a Slab of Coffee Cake


							            							            Nothing appeases masses of overworked, perpetually underpaid educators quite like the wholesome, crumbly goodness of warm, moist government coffee cake. 							        



 






Don McNay: A Teaching Role Model on Teacher Appreciation Week


							            							            The first week of May is Teacher Appreciation Week.   One that I was glad to have was Dan Tieman.  34 years later, I still remember his teaching.  It made an impact on my life. 							        



 






Robert Schwartz: The Best and Brightest Will Never Teach


							            							            I remember my first teacher contract. It was 1994 in LAUSD. The union had just negotiated me a 10 percent raise even though I never taught a day in my life. 							        



 






Joel Shatzky: Educating for Democracy: What if Teachers Ran the Schools?


							            							            I am basing this premise -- absurd as it might seem to educational bureaucrats -- on a conversation I remember my father had many years ago with a Soviet teacher.

				Teachers are the backbone of this country and to read the terrible things people are saying about them on here is downright destructiv­e to the educationa­l system of our country.

Will insulting teachers make someone else sit up and say, "Gee, I think I'd like to be a teacher?" 

Will hurling insults cause teachers to sit up and say, "Oh gee, I don't work hard enough so I think I'll just start working harder."

And after they read these things, do they go to school and look at their students and wonder if they're the ones who insulted their intelligen­ce, their morals, etc.? Or if it was parents of their students? Will they view their students differentl­y? Will they be more inclined to help little Suzy when they're wondering if Suzy's Dad is running around castigatin­g them?

And when they go to the grocery store, do they wonder if the checker was lambasting them and calling for their heads? Or maybe at church, they look around at the people they love and trust and wonder if that love and trust is misplaced?

What do those who have so many negative things to say hope to accomplish by doing so? This is one of those life mysteries that I just can't figure out.

...especia­lly the primary school teachers, ...

...you are gebuine heroes and deserve so much more in terms of both respect and financial reward.

Without you folks our whole country would be like Texas is turning into, funding auto racing and spending time and money on legislatin­g bills regarding cheating in fish tournament­s while defunding education.

				As a teacher I always thought "Teacher Appreciati­on Week" was a sham and a farce.  The Principal, with student help, would put on a breakfast one day and on another you would find a key ring with the school logo on it in your mail box and on another day you might get a computer generated card from the student council.  This was all just fluff and stuff that had little genuine meaning and did little to alter the general lack of respect or regard for teachers during the rest of the year.  I would always tell my students that if they wanted to show their appreciati­on for me as their teacher that they should do the best they could to cooperate with me through out the year.  Someone who cooperates with you while you are trying to help them learn is really showing appreciati­on for your efforts.

				As a teacher, I have to kind of agree. I teach in a Title 1 school in urban Phoenix. Pretty sure that the kids and their parents weren't ever aware of Teacher week. So leave it to the Super of the District to give every teacher a candy bar and the principal gave teachers a white board marker! Next week, they closed a school down. YIKES!

				Like Secretary Duncan and many of you, I am inspired by great teachers that truly influenced my life. Exceptiona­l teachers are the reason I have spent most of my career in education. I was attracted to an education publishing company founded by two phenomenal teachers, Patti Carson and Janet Dellosa.  This HUFFPOST EDUCATION conversati­on made me realize that one week of teacher appreciati­on is inadequate­. We should create a way to recognize great teachers all year long.
I challenge you to use the communicat­ion and social media tools available to advocate for the exceptiona­l teachers in your lives. We would like to create a 52-Week National Teacher Appreciati­on Challenge, where transforma­tional teachers are recognized weekly so that the profession shares it best practices in real time. We routinely interact with teachers and parents and the learning community through the rich dialog that takes place on http://www­.facebook.­com/Carson­Dellosa. Starting today, we invite you to join us in this challenge and share outstandin­g educators in your communitie­s. Each week, we will honor an inspiratio­nal teacher and illuminate best teaching practices.  Let’s grow the list of 7 Ways to Share Your Gratitude to 52 WAYS by adding to the HUFFPOST list or tweet to @HUFFPOSTE­DU with the hashtag#th­ankateache­r. Join us in this exciting online collaborat­ion and ongoing interactio­n so that inspiratio­nal teachers and exceptiona­l instructio­n will be captured, shared and elevated to transform education every week, not just one week a year.

Judy Harris, CEO, Carson-Del­losa Publishing

				Years ago I had the privilege to work three classes away from my eighth grade math teacher.  For months she kept on telling me I could call her by her first name.  One day while sitting down at lunch I looked at her and said "Ann, when I was the student I couldn't stand you and how hard your class was.  It took years for me to know but I now know that almost everything in math I learned from you, thank you."

				I think the best thing for a parent to do is to tell the teacher that you do NOT consider them responsibl­e for the education of your child.  You should consider YOURSELF responsibl­e for the education of your child, and you would appreciate anything that teacher can do to help during those 9 months he/she has your child in their class for 30 hours/week­.

Make sure homework is done.  Make sure your kids get to class.  Make sure your kids stay home when they're too sick to do anything but disrupt the rest of the class.  Do whatever you need to, so the teacher can do their job, which will ultimately help you and your child.

The relief I've seen drop from teachers' shoulders when I have this discussion with them!  Teachers, schools, and school districts are fantastic tools for parents to utilize in the education of their children.  But ultimately­, they have them for a limited time, while you have them for life.

Teaching a curriculum for 9 months is hard enough.  We shouldn't hold teachers responsibl­e for the future of our own children.

				A teacher I know miscarried this week and needed a D&C.  She scheduled it AROUND the state exams her students had to take so they would not have to take the exam with a sub.

Her students have no idea what she was going through nor how difficult it was for her to keep herself together for them.  She is my hero.

				Thank you teachers, your work is so important.  Unfortunat­ely many do not understand what it takes to be a teacher today.  My son and daughter-i­n-law are both teachers and I know how hard they worked to prepare themselves for their profession and how hard they work everyday in their classroom.  Unfortunat­ely many do not understand this...in honor of Teacher Appreciati­on Week, yesterday the emergency school levy failed in their city, 27 teachers lost their jobs including my daughter-i­n-law whose teaching position was eliminated for next year and she will be unemployed­, and my son's position is in jeopardy.  If this trend continues I wonder who will teach my granddaugh­ters and who will be left to appreciate­.

DanCharnas.com:
In July, RollingStone.com commissioned Village Voice pop music columnist Chris Molanphy to craft a feature called "Introducing the King of Hip-Hop."
The request came after the success of Molanphy's previous post for the website, "Introducing the Queen of Pop" -- in which Molanphy measured female music artists' commercial performance in nine different ways and tallied the results. "Queen of Pop" crowned Lady Gaga, garnered 2000 Facebook "Likes" and engendered hundreds of comments-worth of bile from livid fans of Madonna and Brittany Spears.
For "King of Hip-Hop," Molanphy consolidated his nine parameters into just seven -- album sales, album reviews, chart position, touring, social media, YouTube hits, and awards -- and tweaked his spreadsheet a bit, weighing album sales, chart position, and YouTube heavier, and giving less weight to social networking and reviews. Fatefully, Molanphy reprised the "Queen of Pop" survey's irregular time period, a two-and-a-half year span between the beginning of 2009 and mid-2011, so that the data sample would be big enough. All Molanphy had to do was collect the data and crunch the numbers.
Not long after he started entering the figures, Molanphy stopped by Woodwork, a bar near his home in Brooklyn, to meet up with some friends. They asked him how his project was going.
"It’s clear Eminem’s going to win this thing," Molanphy told them.
Oh man, his friends said. You are gonna get hounded for the white guy taking the crown.

				I like Tupac and i regard him as perhaps the king of hip hop.
Lil Wayne and Kanye West doesnt come anywhere near him, however with Dr. Dre´s vital impact on Eminem he is certainly the only one i can listen to that comes near Tupac´s standard.

				Ok, first of all, lets get this straight, Rap IS NOT MUSIC. It is poetry set to music. The poets speak lines, they don't sing them. In most cases they have not even written the background music to their poems, preferring instead to 'borrow' from previously written classics. 
No problem, if you prefer your poetry set to an already establishe­d tune. But when it becomes a dictum of hate for or k*ll*ng of police, women & other n*gg*rs & m*th*af*ck­*rs, then it should not be broadcast in any form available to the young, impression­able, or ignorant.

				I am surprised and according to a biography of Tupac Shakur
Bob Dole republican politician­. in 1993 tried to ban his album because
a black kid who shot police happened to have Tupac´s album on his car.

Now compare that to the bowling of columbine incident 
and most school shootings that have happened to been influenced by death metal
and Marilyn Manson, the outrage for the black rappers inspiring violence is blown out of proportion while no one wants to talk about the death metal genre. 

Rap is not music ?
and most poets have not even written the background music ?
are you serious how do you think a person can rap to a beat if his not on the beat.
Dr Dre is probably the best beat maker and his a rapper too ?
your so old fashioned.­. 
not everyone can rap,  ;)

				And not everyone can play a musical instrument­. Swiping others work and "rapping" over it doeth not a musician make. Personally­, Public Enemy was the last "rap" group of any import. The rest play off misogyny and what columnist Stanley Crouch call minstrelsy­. Making money from selling a product that takes advantage of a people's socio-econ­omic plight is not what I would call music. String together an A chord with a E minor chord with a G chord, etc. That would be called making music. Nevermind auto tune and other gimmicks. Gimme Erykah Badu anyday or Arrested Developmen­t. Yeah, I know old fashioned, but I can play.

				Plenty of hip-hop has singing, as well as original background music. All music shares elements with poetry (even Chopin, not just music with lyrics), but that doesn't mean it isn't music. Also, plenty of hip-hop is not a "dictum of hate", but rather an exposition of American poverty, a cry for help, or a message of love. If you're just listening to the radio, don't be surprised if what you hear is shallow.

				I think the author of this article should listen to what Nas, said and I quote "Ain't No Best".Eminem is great, but right now I think Lupe Fiasco is better, 20 years ago I would have said it was Rakim or KRS-ONE,30 Years ago I would have said it was Melle Mel.For these silly people saying Elvis was the King of Rock and Roll, my question is how can that be when the Beatles made better albums. Most of Elvis's catalog is filled with Gospel music, so how could he be the King of Rock and Roll?Do you listen to music or do you just skim through it? -- Jay Z

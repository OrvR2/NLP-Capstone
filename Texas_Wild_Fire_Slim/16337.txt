Eminem And Lil Kim Duke It Out For Favorite RapFix Live Moment

Posted 13 hrs ago by D.L. Chandler in Interviews,  Music News,  RapFix Live 



Hosted by MTV News' resident rap icon, Sway Calloway, “RapFix Live” has featured exclusive in-depth interviews with some of hip hop's biggest stars. This Wednesday, (September 14) the show will celebrate its one-year anniversary with a special edition at 4 p.m. ET featuring appearances by Trina, Lloyd Banks and Tha Outlawz.
Last week we asked fans to vote on their favorite "RapFix Live" moments, and while the votes continue to pour in it appears that a certain pair of Detroit rhyme slingers may have eclipsed the field of competition. Back in May, an appearance on “RapFix Live” from Bad Meets Evil duo Eminem and Royce Da 5’9 has leapt out as an early front runner as we approach Tuesday’s (September 13) voting deadline. On the show, Slim Shady revealed to Sway that his move from rapping to acting proved far more difficult than fellow rapper turned actor peer Ice Cube originally advised. Sway chopped it up with the longtime rap pals on the set of the duo’s “Fast Lane” video set.  Read more...

Thanks to Newsvine user beth-4037097, who pointed out that the original headline, Cops: Teen arsonists sought over Texas wildfire, referred to a different fire to the one depicted in the photographs below. The arsonists were sought in connection with a fire in the city of Leander, Texas, as reported by the Austin-American Statesman.Original post:Rich Shulman writes:It's amazing that the fire spared this one house.Recent PhotoBlog posts from Texas wildfires and drought.Slideshow.Eric Gay / APHomes destroyed by wildfire are seen Wednesday, Sept. 7 in Bastrop, Texas.

beth-4037097This is a misleading title. The Steiner Ranch fire in northwest Travis county was reportedly caused by teen arsonists. The Bastrop fire, depicted in the pictures here, was not.

Cars That Thieves Don't WantBy Jeanine Skowronski | TheStreet.com – Tue, Sep 6, 2011 1:49 PM EDT





Thieves favor large pickups and SUVs.The Highway Loss Data Institute recently released its annual list of the most- and least-stolen vehicles,  and a perusal of the top 10 most stolen cars list indicates thieves still favor large pickups and SUVs. The No. 1 stolen car of the year, for instance, was the Cadillac Escalade, a large luxury SUV. Thieves are also going for large cars known for their power (or Hemi) engines, including the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger and Nissan Maxima.MORE AT THESTREET.COM» 10 Hot Cars You Can’t Have Yet» The Most Car Accident-Prone Cities» 5 Car Repair Myths That Save You CashConversely, the cars appearing on the least-stolen list tend to be small or midsize vehicles that are more sedate in appearance and, as senior vice president of the Highway Loss Data Institute Kim Hazelbaker says, in some cases just not worth going to jail for."It's a mixed bag of vehicles," Hazelbaker says. That mixed bag includes some unexpected vehicles.Measuring the madnessThe Highway Loss Data Institute bases its ranking on data provided by insurers representing about 80% of the market for privately insured vehicles.That means it doesn't include information on thefts of uninsured vehicles or vehicles insured by non-reporting companies. It also doesn't address whether the theft was of the entire vehicle, vehicle parts or vehicle contents, instead identifying which cars are most often targeted by thieves across the board.Claim frequencies are determined per 1,000 insured vehicles and form the basis of the ranking. Vehicles are from 2008-10 model years unless otherwise noted.2011 Mini Cooper Clubman Mini Cooper ClubmanClaim frequency: 0.7 Average loss payment per claim: $1,883 Vehicle size/type: Mini two-door carChevrolet Aveo (2008-2010)Claim frequency: 0.6 Average loss payment per claim: $7,642 Vehicle size/type: Mini station wagonBMW 5-series.BMW 5 series 4WD Claim frequency: 0.7 Average loss payment per claim: $12,200 Vehicle size/type: Large luxury carHazelbacker explains that one of the reasons BMW's
 5 series and (spoiler alert!) two other luxury vehicles popped up on 
the list of least-stolen vehicles is that these types of cars have 
excellent ignition immobilizers, which prevent vehicles from being 
hot-wired."It's a technical issue," he says, explaining that one
 of the reasons pickups are popular amongst thieves is that, until 
recently, they didn't have immobilizers as part of their standard 
equipment package.Saturn Vue Claim frequency: 0.6 Average loss payment per claim: $3,747 Vehicle size/type: Midsize SUVLexus RX-350Lexus RX 350 (2010) Claim frequency: 0.6 Average loss payment per claim: $6,084 Vehicle size/type: Midsize luxury SUVChevrolet Equinox 4WD (2010) Claim frequency: 0.6 Average loss payment per claim: $4,870 Vehicle size/type: Midsize SUVVolkswagen CCVolkswagen CC (2009-10) Claim frequency: 0.6 Average loss payment per claim: $7,098 Vehicle size/type: Midsize carChevrolet Equinox (2010) Claim frequency: 0.6 Average loss payment per claim: $2,069 Vehicle size/type: Midsize SUV (The Chevrolet Equinox and the Chevrolet Equinox 4WD are the same car with different features.)Mercury Mariner Claim frequency: 0.5 Average loss payment per claim: $1,970 Vehicle size/type: Small SUVAudi A6Audi A6 4WD Claim frequency: 0.5 Average loss payment per claim: $16,882 Vehicle size/type: Large luxury car In addition to having better immobilizers, Hazelbaker attributed Audi's disfavor to its appearance; along with its luxury counterparts the Lexus RX350 and the BMW 5 series, availability issues also prevent theft. For instance, he says, these cars "are more likely to be spending the night in a suburban garage" than on a city street.

by the way in Bulgaria a country of 7 million peoples , only in the capital alone 12 car are stolen a day , and the police is working with the maf in close contact even they are insure the clear horizon for them to flee the CS, oh why Am so surprised in a country leaded by the mafia  , you can see wiki leaks for that when the american embassy wrought about the prim minister as a mafia boss in several occasions

Mortgage refinancing means re-funding the mortgage loan with better terms as well as conditions, most likely from a different lender. It is one way to save money. Search online for "123 Refinance" they found me 3.1% refinance rate and also gave free analysis of my mortgage. You got to learn the secrets.

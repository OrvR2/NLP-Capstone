Anheuser-Busch donates canned water for wildfire relief

Fire consumes a forest as a wildfire  burns on Tuesday, Sept. 6, 2011, near Magnolia, Texas. A large blaze burning in forests in Montgomery, Waller and Grimes counties north and west of Houston contributed to more than 1,000 homes that have been destroyed in at least 57 Texas fires.

Anheuser-Busch InBev, the global brewing giant that operates a plant in Houston, is donating to the wildfire relief effort with nearly 3,000 cases of drinking water.
The company sent the following release this afternoon:
ST.  LOUIS (Sept. 7, 2011) – There’s  a need for drinking water in  areas of Texas affected by wildfires, and  Anheuser-Busch is  contributing to the relief effort.  The brewer is providing 2,940 cases of drinking water — or 70,560 cans — for use by residents affected by  wildfires  that have resulted from a severe drought.
A  truck loaded with water left the company’s brewery in Cartersville, Ga.,  yesterday and is scheduled to arrive tomorrow at the local Budweiser wholesaler  in Austin, Brown Distributing, 8711 Johnny Morris Road. A second shipment will  be sent to Silver Eagle Distributors in Cypress, 8660 N. Eldridge Parkway,  arriving later this week.
Both  wholesalers will work with relief organizations to get the water where it’s  needed.
“People  in Texas are in need of fresh drinking water, and this is one way Anheuser-Busch  and our local wholesalers can help,” said Peter Kraemer, vice president of  Supply for Anheuser-Busch.
In  April the brewer sent more than 100,000 cans of water to West Central Texas to  areas affected by wildfires, and last  week the company sent more than 400,000 cans to assist with some of the hardest  hit areas of the East Coast affected by Hurricane Irene.  So far this year  Anheuser-Busch has donated more than 1.7  million cans of water for U.S.  disaster relief.  Since 1988, Anheuser-Busch has donated more than 70 million  cans of drinking water following natural and other  disasters.
Helping  communities cope with disasters has been an Anheuser-Busch tradition since 1906  when Adolphus Busch made a donation to victims of the San Francisco earthquake.   Today, in addition to providing monetary support, Anheuser-Busch packages fresh  drinking water and donates it to emergency relief organizations for distribution  to those in need.
As longtime reader Craig Stichtenoth noted on the Beer, TX Facebook page a few minutes ago:
Jokes  about the similarity between the taste of this water and some of their  beer products aside, A-B has historically been very good about doing  this in time of water need.

Forget the cost of the water. You have to give IN-BEV credit for a foreign company to spend the cash not only on the Aluminum cans but the cost of shutting down production to retool the label printers and clean the lines to run clean water through.  It’s probably costing the company a dollar a can or more. Great advertising and maybe tax deductible even.

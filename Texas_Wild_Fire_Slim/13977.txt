Weather Outlook:

A surface ridge of dry high pressure will maintain a dry air mass and northerly component to the flow to most of the Lone Star state. A surface trough of low pressure in place over the panhandle during the afternoon will lead to some gusty winds at times over the far northern portions of the panhandle where an isolated shower or thunderstorm could occur. The pressure gradient will be strongest near the Interstate 35 corridor today, where winds should generally be strongest sustained, around 10 mph for a few hours in the late afternoon to early evening hours. Relative humidity this afternoon will be slightly higher than yesterday in most places, but the majority of the state should experience minimum relative humidity below 25 percent. Many areas will fall to the 10 to 20 percent range. High temperatures will range in the 80s and 90s in general, but will approach 100 over Deep South Texas. Poor overnight recoveries are expected again for areas away from the coast, especially locations west of Interstate 35. Dry conditions will continue as high pressure over Texas and Oklahoma moves very slowly east. Northeast flow 6-10 mph, with gusts to 12-15 mph will be common. Partly sunny skies with high clouds moving into the northern areas, and sunny skies across the south will allow afternoon high temperatures to climb to 85-92. Relative humidity values fall to 14 to 20 percent in the northwest and 18 to 30 percent across the southeast. Poor to moderate overnight recoveries of 50 percent in the northwest to 60-65 percent in the east and south are expected.

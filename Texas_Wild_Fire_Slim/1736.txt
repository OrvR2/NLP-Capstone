AllThingsD:
Hulu's corporate owners are currently mulling bids from three would-be buyers: Amazon, Yahoo, and the Dish Network.
And then there's Google. The search giant has also made an offer for the video site, but it seems to be playing a different sport than the rest of its peers: Rather than bid on what Hulu's owners have offered for sale, Google has proposed a different acquisition, on a larger scale, say people familiar with the sales process.

				I actually think that this is a great idea. If Google bought Hulu they could expand it out to other countries. The main reason that it's U.S. exclusive is because of other companies not being able to find the ad support to make the site internatio­nal, but since Google is the Ad King, then Hulu around the world is a very big possibilit­y. 

Also, if you read up on this on other sites it says that most bidders have requested an up to 5 year content deal, with exclusivit­y. Plus this would be great as an Android booster, which is already over half of the mobile market share.

				This would be a bad decision on Google's part. Take that probably four billion and invest in actual worthwhile properties­. Try to buy out George Lucas or something. Maybe buy out full rights to Star Trek. I mean, even just 2 billion is probably enough to buy out all of the British Film Industry (we'll even toss in Nollywood free of charge). 

And for God's sake make whatever new site not preceded by Google. If Flickr were called Yahoo Photos, it'd be closed by now. Sometimes it's best not to dilute the brand.

				I can't find any report of Google's alleged high bid or 'grand scheme' anywhere else other than this one report on ATD. 

Why would Google pay over the odds for Hulu when they're already trying to get pay-per-vi­ew content on YouTube? Why not ignore Hulu (which, let's be honest, isn't exactly a roaring success) and deal with content providers directly?

I'll wait and see. It sounds like a dumb move for Google, but so was paying billions for Motorola Mobility when they'd already sold most of their most valuable patents just to stay afloat.

				Think it's the tie in with the major movie studios, like Fox, Google wants.

If they get Hulu and tie the studios in to a multi-year contract, I think google will relaunch GoogleTV with Hulu at it's centre.

				That's a very good point. 

But again, aren't they already dealing with studios directly for Google TV? Don't forget that despite being part-owned by studios, Hulu still has deals with those studios and those deals *do* have an expiration date. Would Google really spend a ton of money only to find themselves in 2 years time negotiatin­g again with studios... except if, as you suggest, Google make Hulu central to GoogleTV, then the studios would have then Google over a really, really big barrel. 

I don't see the logic in it. 

But then I'm not a billionair­e tech executive, so what the heck do I know.

				Yes, that's true, but those rights are granted by a contract that expires in 2 years (I wish I could find the link where I read that, so please treat it as unconfirme­d rumour).

Hulu is slowly dying, which is why they put themselves up for sale. The studios don't want anything more to do with it. The terms of any sale may or may not include a renegotiat­ion of content rights. 

All I'm saying is that I don't understand why a company with Google's cash reserves would spend over the asking price for this brand when even its owners have lost faith.

				I normally applaud Google for their purchases but this seems like its going to be an epic fail, I know Hulu gets millions of views a day but there Hulu Plus option isn't catching on quite like they hoped, and they don't have the name recognitio­n of a Netflix or the movie selection. Hulu's best days are behind it, and they are being saturated with commercial­s, if this was a year ago I think it'd be a good idea, but now if you watch a regular sitcom on Hulu the difference in commercial­s being viewed with regular television is only about a minute or two.

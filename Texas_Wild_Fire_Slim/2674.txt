Gaddafi defiant in call Syria TV says is from LibyaBy Joseph Nasr and Ahmed Tolba | Reuters – 3 hrs ago

CAIRO (Reuters) - Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, in a phone call a Syrian television station said was made from inside Libya, vowed Thursday to defeat rebels who control most of the country.
He also said a Libyan military convoy that arrived in neighboring Niger was "not the first," and gave no hint this might be a step toward him and his followers fleeing Libya.
Gaddafi, whose whereabouts are unknown, instead said in the brief live speech carried by Arrai TV that his forces would rally to defeat the rebels and NATO, which has attacked his military through air strikes.
"The youths are now ready to escalate the resistance against the 'rats' (rebels) in Tripoli and to finish off the mercenaries," Gaddafi said during the call, which the television station said was being made from within Libya.
"We will defeat NATO...and NATO is rejected by the Libyan people," he said.
Gaddafi said the Libyan military convoy, which French and Niger military sources said showed up in the northern Niger city of Agadez this week, was nothing exceptional.
"Columns of convoys drive into and out of Niger carrying goods and people inside and outside (of Libya) say Gaddafi is going to Niger," he said.
"This is not the first time that convoys drive in and out of Niger."
Gaddafi's spokesman has repeatedly said he is in Libya and remains in high spirits. Niger said he was not in the convoy.
Libya's ruling National Transitional Council (NTC) has sent envoys to Niger to try to stop Gaddafi and his entourage from evading justice by fleeing across a desert frontier toward friendly African states.

Enough is enough. Gaddhafi must stop speaking. He brutalised his own people, now from beneath of sand of Sahara he is trying to  make his people fool. Neighbouring countries should think twice to grant any assylum.

I'm trying to understand our great support of the support for the rebellion in Libya.  I just don't get it.  Is it because we just love rebellion, or do we really love to support enemies?  Yes, Gaddafi, and his government were responsible for Pan Am flight 103.  He's been an enemy.  However, to quote the phrase "the enemy of my enemy is my friend", which is worse, an enemy that is responsible for the death of 270 people back in the 80's but has since become a point of stability, and support since, or an enemy that has, much more recently killed thousands, and still has the central goal of killing more?   Al Qaeda and the US/NATO are ALLIES in supporting the rebellion in Lybia!   Does that sink in?  We are currently allies with Al Qaeda!  (don't believe me?  Google it for yourself, Al Qaeda leadership supports the ousting of Gaddafi).  Lybia, Algeria, and Niger are NOT Al Qaeda friendly governments.  Egypt wasn't, but thanks to our assistance, they now are much more 'tolerant'.  

Even reading the comments to this article, it boggles my mind why so many support Libyan rebels??  Does any of you understand the consequences this is going to have, both in and outside of Libya?  For an Islamic nation (majority wise), Libya had some of the best equal rights around, especially for women.  You are very mistaken if you think for one second, that any government that comes out of this rebellion is going to be friends with us.

Lawnmower God Awful is a puke!  He is hiding from the people and using what little control he has left to try to terrorize the people that he once controled!  He should be hunted down and given the same treatment he has given the people of his domain!

Greed kills!

This poor Gaddafi needs to show up to lead his supporters and stop calling the rebels a "Rat" when he's the one hiding underground the bunker.

Advice for Col. Gaddaffi: When he saw that the situation was hopeless, your friend, Marcos, chose to flee rather than launch a counterattack. After his death, his family was allowed to return and today his widow is in congress and his son was elected governor. Follow his example and spare your people from suffering.

Before the terrorist rebel uprising, the living standards of Libyans have improved significantly since the 1970s, ranking the country among the highest in Africa. Urbanization, developmental projects, and high oil revenues have enabled the Libyan government to elevate its people's living standards. The social and economic status of women and children has particularly improved. Various subsidized or free services (health, education, housing, and basic foodstuffs) have ensured basic necessities. The low percentage of people without access to safe water (3 percent), health services (0 percent) and sanitation (2 percent), and a relatively high life expectancy (70.2 years)  indicate the improved living standards. Adequate health care and subsidized foodstuffs have sharply reduced infant mortality, from 105 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 20 per 1,000 live births. The government also subsidizes education, which is compulsory and free between the ages of 6 and 15. The expansion of educational facilities has elevated the literacy rate (78.1  and rising). There are universities in Tripoli, Benghazi, Marsa el-Brega, Misurata, Sebha, and Tobruq. Many direct and indirect subsidies and free services have helped raise the economic status of low-income families, a policy which has prevented extreme poverty

Have you all noticed in Yahoo's "9/11 REMEMBERED" feature no one can post anything and they just continue to spew out the "official" government propaganda on 9/11, though TONS of data, eyewintness accounts, and even scientists, engineers and technicians have questioned and debunked the "official" view.  Is this America, or Nazi Germany?

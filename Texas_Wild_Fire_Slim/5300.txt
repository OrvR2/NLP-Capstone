‘Where were you?’ News outlets crowdsource their 9/11 coverageBy Joe PompeoMedia ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Joe Pompeo | The Cutline – Fri, Aug 26, 2011

One of the 9/11 relics collected by Dan Barry (Richard Perry/The New York Times)Media outlets have been pouring resources into their 9/11 coverage as the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks approaches. Among the most valuable resources, it turns out, are readers.
From the Post and Courier of Charleston, S.C. to the Bulletin of South Washington County, Minn., news organizations nationwide are asking readers to share their memories of that day, when thousands of Americans died after al Qaeda operatives crashed passenger planes into the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and a barren field in Pennsylvania.
"It's the question that comes up over and over again every year--where were you?," said Amy Westfeldt, the 9/11 anniversary editor of the AP, which put out a call for "most vivid" 9/11 memories on its Facebook page earlier this month and has since been compiling the responses into a weekly feature.
"I was 9 years old on 9/11," Jeffersonton, Va. resident Coy Ferrell recalls in the latest installment, "and at least here they had a constant patrol of fighters all throughout the region from soon after the attacks to weeks after the attacks. Whenever I hear a jet fighter I still cringe."
These exercises in crowd-sourcing reflect the increased interactivity that is becoming more a part of the fabric of news reporting. (Yahoo! News, for its part, is gathering submissions on the 9/11 blog it has set up to mark the anniversary.)
"The days of a website just being a website are over," said Jimmy Orr, the managing editor of latimes.com. "Reader engagement is so very important, social media is so important. People expect to be able to interact."
That was the thinking behind the Los Angeles Times' "Where were you?" on 9/11 project. The paper posed this question on its homepage and has likewise been encouraging readers to submit their recollections--including photos and video--on Tumblr.
"Many hundreds" of submissions have poured in, said Orr. The result is an interactive 9/11 landing page on latimes.com that collects some of the most poignant of these alongside relevant reportage from the paper's journalists. The newspaper also has been sharing select vignettes on Tumblr.
"I called my ex-wife, who worked about 15 miles closer to Manhattan, and  frantically told her to pick up the baby and return to the house, that  we should all be together in case a nuclear bomb went off," writes Tony Dela Cruz of of Marlborough, Mass., who at the time was a magazine editor living on Long Island. "I found  myself wanting to skip over 'well-planned terrorist attack' and go  directly to Armageddon, as if increasing the gravity of the situation  would make what had happened easier to accept. ... This loss still feels fresh as the day it happened."
The Daily, News Corp.'s 6-month-old iPad newspaper, also used Tumblr to spread the word. The digital tabloid comes equipped with a feature that enables readers to leave audio comments using the iPad's built-in microphone. The editors decided to ask readers to "help create an oral history of the day" by leaving 60-second sound bytes of their 9/11 stories that will be adapted into a multimedia feature as part of The Daily's forthcoming anniversary coverage. Dozens have come in so far.
"One of the great things about this is that it's an experiment," said Mike Nizza, The Daily's managing editor. "It's a human exercise for these people--taking the time to remember and tell their stories."
The New York Times is using the lobby of its Midtown Manhattan headquarters to host an art exhibit of 9/11 reflections. The show, open to the public from Sept. 8 to Sept. 12, will include photos of 9/11 relics that readers submitted to Times reporter Dan Barry after he put out a request on nytimes.com. Some of the photos will be published in print and online on Sept. 11.
"Dan keeps some objects from his months covering 9/11 on his desk--relics, he calls them--and we simply wondered what objects other people might have kept," said Laura Chang, the editor overseeing the Times' 9/11 coverage. "Hundreds of readers have sent us images of objects, some obviously related to 9/11 and some that reveal the connection only in the telling."
As for Barry, "I have the construction helmet that I wore when I camped out near the  site with the National Guard, several days after the collapse," he writes. "I have a flier from the Dakota Roadhouse bar in Lower Manhattan, saying  in colorful language that since Osama bin Laden has us working overtime,  it's time to drink."

Did you know Portland, Oregon (45° north latitude), is going to be nuked by a "nuclear dirty bomb" (a "false flag" nuclear attack) on Sunday, 11/6/11, at 5:55PM (when the big hand on a face clock is on "11" and the small hand is near the "6", being the inversion of "9/11")?  This is ten years AFTER 2001 when 9/11 happened, and it will be perpetrated by the very same covert operatives of the Underground Global Government who also orchestrated the 9/11 "false flag" attacks which were aimed at pushing the draconian Constitution-nullifying Patriot Act through; the operatives, of course, are the arm of the Zionists-Globalists-Global Banksters-Illuminati, being the CIA, MI6 & MOSSAD.  It will activate their goal of WWIII and the climax 3 years later of a global thermal nuclear holocaust to depopulate 50% of Earth's population.  The nuclear attack will be falsely blamed on Islamic terrorists, which is why TPTB fabricated the faked Osama assassination to generate the needed "retaliation" and "revenge" factor required for a scapegoat to blame for the nuclear attack on Portland/America.  If you fall for the scheme, you will be a manipulated pawn as TPTB desire.

Google the following articles and/or see the following videos on YouTube:

SEE VIDEO: "Footage of Mass Artillery Movements Across U.S." - this is video of vast military artillery movents into the Portland area in preparation for the post-nuclear civil mayhem... Martial Law will be declared... there will be no 2012 Presidential Election, Obama will assume de facto authority until America is ultimately nuked by Russia and China, all planned by TPTB, the Globalists.

SEE ACLU ARTICLE: "Are You Living in a Constitution Free Zone?" – in 2006 the Patriot Act established a draconian Constitution-nullifying “security zone” around the periphery of the entire Continental U.S. that penetrates 100 miles inland and possesses the force of unwarranted search, seizures and detainment, nullifying and voiding ALL your constitutional rights and freedoms, completely superseding the U.S. Constitution, Amendments and Bill of Rights.

SEE VIDEO:  “ALERT - HOMELAND SECURITY - BORDER PATROL - FOREIGN TROOPS - CONSTITUTION FREE ZONE” – one man’s startling personal experience and encounter with Homeland Security Agents near the Canadian border, and his inadvertent discovery of the “Constitution Free Zone.” 

SEE VIDEO: “THE SIMPSONS - 911 WAS PREDICTED” – imbedded in a May 2010 episode are the clues to the Portland false flag nuclear attack, just as the 9/11/01 false flag terrorist attack on NY was also imbedded in a Sept. 21, 1997 episode of the Simpsons.  Note that the Zionists-Illuminati (Rothschild & Company) OWN the Media and Hollywood and use the entertainment outlets for subliminal programming for their global initiatives.  Most peculiar, they tell us what atrocities they will do BEFORE they do it as a strange guilt-freeing ritual, like Pontius Pilate washing his hands of the guilt and blood of the crucified Messiah; in fact, they literally call it “washing of the hands.”

 Now, the video poster who originally made this video got everything right except for the year of the event predicted.  He erroneously mis-assumed that the major “10” clue, being the face of the clock with a linear structural attachment for the number ONE and the round clock face for the zero that lands in Homer’s backyard with the time frozen at 5:55PM was pointing to the year 2010.  In reality it is a clue to 10 years AFTER 2001 (9/11), hence being this year 2011.

Asleep in Busan, So. Korea waiting to fly a 747 to LAX that day. That of course did not happen. I got back to U.S. soil a full week later.

Read "Against All Enemies" by Richard Clark.  It will tell you where all the politicians were from 1980 to 9/11/01.  It's an eye opener.

I was two blocks away. I knew quite a few people who's families will never see them again. Can we just for once mourn for the losses of brave and innocent people?

Exactly what is intended on the subject of 9-11....where were you and what were you doing is the way they want you to think about it. So safe and non-controversial. Yet, there remains a growing number who still want more sufficient answers as to what happened and how?

I was kidnapped by Frank Wirts brother (by gunpoint) at Tom Taylors Buena Vista Trailer Park(TX) in Oct 2000, then kidnapped to Tampa FL to the insane, schizo, racketeering Jew Judge named James D. Whittemore (who killed Terry Schivo in 2003). I was then insanely destroyed on 3 sets of falsified probable cause affidavits (two stolen ,precious time taken) while in the corrupt Tampa Jail. When Dr. William E. Bonney PH.D wrote an exam stating I was sane , fine and competent (and even to do my own trial) the racketeering enterprise and its Sarasota crybaby racketeering FBI should have dropped everything and let me go but no they insanely continued their ruthless attempted murder on me right past a trial (which I done pro se and they even flew Tom Taylor over to Tampa against me?) . The spoiled, scum, garbage, crybaby, weakling sissies in the Sarasota FBI were so obssessed with killing me (for millions of dollars) that they completely forgot to to catch the terrorists training right down the road 2 miles away at Huffman Aviation??? They could have made 500,000 at least for every head they caught but they let them train at Huffman Aviation while destroying and attempting to kill me instead ? This is how our (SIO)FBI Sissy Infested Orgranization operates ? Have you know they are still obssessed with killing me (for money) as they just failed at falsifing my Fed Taxes on my small business and drummed a fake Florida Tax lean on my credit Report (Trans Union) of 1100.00 (felony warrant). I (by miracle) found out about the fax tax (jew ) lean while answering a mortgage advertisement on the radio out of Michigan (they done a credit check). Yes, the Tax lean "Docket # (it was called) didnt even exist in FL as I called Sarasota County and they told me? Therfore it was a fake drummed up fake tax lean docket number by the SIO straight out of Muellers Sissy office in Washington D.C.! This is what our SIO is doing to innocent people when they could be catching real criminals but they are getting paid much more money to frame people instead and out of Public Law 101-647. Anyone who justifies this insane racketeering behaviour is a SIO(FBI) sissy lover. Thx Kevin. ("Animal")

I was temping at U.S. Financial Life Insurance in Blue Ash, Ohio. My wife called me. We were sent home at 14:00. The next day the owner addressed the staff (he was from N.Y.) and told us to continue our lives without alternating plans due to the terrorists. We moved to VA and lived there to 2004, near all the military bases.

I watched from my apartment, but never saw any planes.  I did however see the two missiles that hit the towers.  Amazing what news media and graphics can do for special effects these days.  Watch "September Clues" on YouTube.  It explains how the media covered up 9-11 and planted the lie in the public's mind that it was carried out by Bin Laden and "Al Qaeda".

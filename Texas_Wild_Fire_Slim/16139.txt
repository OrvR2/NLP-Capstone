                                                                 –
                                                                Texas’ Bastrop Wildfire has already been named the state’s worst ever, and it continues to rage: Now 1,386 homes have been destroyed, and the fire is just 30% contained. Two people have died, one of them a city of Austin employee found inside his home. The fire has burned about 38,000 acres and has affected a 25 mile by 20 mile area, MyFox Austin reports.
                                                            

                                                                Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters, as well as 366 firefighters, have been battling the blaze. Officials hope to contain more of the fire before winds worsen tomorrow, but they have warned containment could still be days away. More than 5,000 residents have been displaced, school has been canceled, roads have been closed, and 4,300 are without power. Meanwhile, another wildfire broke out this week and consumed 27 homes, but has been 100% contained.

                Rick Perry and his Republican buddies cut the funding for the Texas volunteer firefighters last year trying to cover a $27 Billion deficit in Texas. This fire just might just have been controlled better with the help that didn't get hired. Penny wise pound foolish dumbass 60 year old cowboy with his hair dyed.

                Another mess made by a Bush clone (Perry) that somebody else will have to clean up.

Perry cut firefighting funds by 75% 6 months ago.

                Well they shouldn't have been living in such a flammable area.  If they aren't going to use their heads and live somewhere less dry they shouldn't expect the rest of us to throw money at them-they should be left to rot.

Texas Fires' Toll: 1,000 Homes and Counting


Firefighters still trying to contain blazes fed by Tropical Storm Lee
                    (AP) - More than 1,000 homes have been destroyed in at least 57 wildfires across rain-starved Texas, most of them in one devastating blaze near Austin that is still raging out of control, officials said today. Gov. Rick Perry, who cut short a presidential campaign trip to South Carolina to return to Texas, toured a blackened area near Bastrop, about 25 miles from Austin, where a fast-moving blaze destroyed nearly 600 homes yesterday.

Texas Wildfire Is 'Worst Ever'


Nearly 500 homes destroyed; 3.5M acres charred this year
                    (NEWSER) - Wildfires continued to ravage Central Texas yesterday as firefighters battled the most devastating single fire in Texas history, the Los Angeles Times reports. As of yesterday, 476 homes had been destroyed in Bastrop County, east of Austin; firefighters battled the flames as they tore through thousands of acres. With 40 square miles already charred, the fire remained a threat, though no one has been seriously injured, the American-Statesman notes. “This one is as mean-looking as I've ever seen,” said Gov. Rick Perry. More»

Mom, child killed in separate blaze in tinderbox state
                    (NEWSER) - A mother and child have been killed in a blaze near Dallas, while another "catastrophic" Texas wildfire has destroyed 300 homes and sent thousands of residents near Austin fleeing for their lives. The 16-mile-long Austin fire has burned through 14,000 acres and is now threatening an additional 700 houses, reports the American-Statesman . Firefighters were battling a dozen brush and grass blazes throughout eastern and central Texas yesterday as dry conditions and winds whipped up by Tropical Storm Lee turn the state into a tinderbox. Two of the fires were started when flames jumped from barbeque pits, and one ignited as a teen burned love letters outdoors, said officials. More»





6 States Ablaze, 1.2M Acres Lost


OK, fire not being caused by illegal immigrants, admits John McCain
                    (NEWSER) - Six states are ablaze in a searing summer that's breaking records for wildfires. More than 1.2 million acres have already burned and some 10,000 people have been forced to flee their homes as flames devour land in Arizona, New Mexico, California, and Colorado, as well as Georgia and Texas. Some 3,500 firefighters have battled Arizona's Wallow fire that has consumed some 500,000 acres, and 700 smoke-eaters are wrestling the Monument fire near Sierra Vista in the state. "I feared for my husband, my animals and for the air quality," one fleeing Arizonan told ABC News . Also hardest hit is Texas, suffering its worst drought in history, where some 15,000 acres have burned in temperatures topping 100 degrees. More»

GOP senator claims president doesn't like Lone Star state
                    (NEWSER) - GOP Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison thinks President Obama has it out for Texas. "I see a bias in this administration," she said on MSNBC today. Specifically, she cites the denial of federal disaster funds for the state's recent wildfires and claims that Obama is reluctant to help secure the Mexican border. "I do think that a lot of the rhetoric has rubbed the administration wrong, and we have had to fight hard for our fair share." More»

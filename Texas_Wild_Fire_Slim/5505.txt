Illinois Governor Pat Quinn on Tuesday admitted that the reports about thousands of state employee layoffs and facility closures across the state shortly are true.
As the Chicago Tribune reports, Quinn is expected to announce the closure of several facilities, including a prison, juvenile detention center and homes for the mentally ill and disabled, this week. Further, thousands of state workers will be laid off, despite the Democratic governor's previous promise to AFSCME, the state's largest public employee union, that no layoffs were coming down the pike.
The layoffs and closures are necessary, Quinn said, because the state's General Assembly did not appropriate enough funding in the budget they approved to keep the state operating for the entirety of the fiscal year ahead, NBC Chicago reports. He has thus far declined to say how many jobs will be cut nor which specific facilities will be impacted.
(Scroll down to watch Quinn responding to reports of his plans for statewide cutbacks.)
"We can't spend money we don't have," Quinn said Tuesday, as reported by NBC Chicago. "We have to do what we have to do."
In response to Quinn's move, AFSCME is expected to sue, as they did in July after the governor canceled $75 million in raises for 30,000 state workers. The union said they have yet to receive any notification from the governor's office about the planned cutbacks, but said such a course of action would be "in direct violation of negotiated agreements with our union," Capitol Fax reports.
"Moreover, it would have a dire impact on the maintenance of public safety and the delivery of services of vital importance to the people of Illinois," AFSCME said in a statement. 
The union urged Quinn to "work with the General Assembly to forestall service cuts and layoffs" by appropriating more funding for the state's budget, adding that "there is certainly not a funding crisis at this point in time. There is merely a crisis of will."
State Republican leaders are likely to have a different take on the union's call for further appropriations, as the four highest-ranking GOP leaders in Springfield last month trashed Quinn's borrowing plan for the state and called for even further cuts to the budget.
State Senator and former gubernatorial candidate Bill Brady (R-Bloomington) described Quinn's planned layoffs as "a political document" in conversation with WJBC and conjectured that many of the facility closures, in particular, would more heavily impact Republican-dominated areas in the state.
"I assume it will be a political document. It will be interesting to see how many of these facilities are in areas where Democrats are running," Brady told WJBC of his former rival. "He's turning into a blowhard that has no credibility in the General Assembly."

				Isn't Illinois run by Democrats and has been for decades?  Why hasn't their government philosophy worked to keep their budgets funded?  Can't blame the federal government the state budget comes from state taxes?  Illinois should be left to file bankruptcy­, businesses and residents are leaving in mass because of the corruption­, hiring taqxes, reduced services.  They are going to implode under the pension obligation­s and it should be left to implode as a warning to unions.

				This is where the federal government is needed most.  It is just not Illinois facing massive layoffs and closures. For those who said the stimulus didn't work, it did. Now that the money is gone there is no way the states can sustain themselves during these economic crisis.  The Republican­s had no problem holding up BANKS and CORPORATIO­NS when they CAUSED THIS GLOBAL RECESSION.  The State is suffering from the same fall out many Americans are.  Illinois unemployme­nt rate, I believe is 10%. So that is 10% of the citizens of Illinois not paying income taxes.  That is 10% on top of the other uncounted citizens needing government assistance­, like Food Stamps, Mediaid, headstart, housing assistance­. The states are the ones that pay for that with some assistance from Federal Government­. However, the Feds have cut their assistance and many states like Illinois can't pay their bills. This in not a spending problem but a revenue one.  United States Federal Government System was designed as a safety net to protect all citizen via the military and quality of life.  Now the MEDIA AND REPUBLICAN­S have brainwashe­d Americans to distrust government when we need them the most.

				Yeah, I agree ... this was caused by the folks at the top in several ways ... they failed to regulate or police themselves and others, they took excessive compensati­on and bonuses - for any kind of performanc­e - meaning they were all corrupted by power and greed.  We should get rid of all of them, and put the worst that we can prove in jail for a long long time and prevent them from ever going back into their previous jobs.

				No stimulus for union hiring or union jobs.  The problems in Illinois are due to the unions.  Let Illinois go bankrupt not federal bailout of their budget or their pensions.  Unions need to use some of those political contributi­ons and start a company, pay the illinois state income tax on profits and provide jobs.

				Bill Brady is apparently unaware of his hypocrisy.  We're not providing enough revenue to keep many facilities open, but the Governor better not touch Republican districts.  He wants the services for his constituen­ts, but not for the entire state.  

Of course, some of the people being affected by this (home for the mentally ill and disabled) are the people who are probably the least equipped to become homeless because of budget cutting Republican­s.

				People who pay no taxes have just as much right to vote as those better off...I would hope you aren't implying that with wealth, comes the right to vote?

I would like to add that during this economic downturn, the proportion of folks paying less or no taxes has skyrockete­d.  

And by taxes, of course, you are talking only income taxes.  Sales and property taxes continue to be paid by the poor, should they buy goods, and those poor able to hold onto their homes....f­or now.

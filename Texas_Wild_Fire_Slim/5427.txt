Chicago Sun-Times:
The real Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the fake Rahm Emanuel met Tuesday night -- but this time there was no vortex.
The mayor showed up at the Hideout for an event to promote "The F***ing Epic Twitter Quest of @MayorEmanuel" -- a book of vulgar tweets by Dan Sinker who was posing as Emanuel during his campaign for mayor.

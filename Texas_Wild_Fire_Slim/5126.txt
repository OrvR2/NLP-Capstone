» More Information on Texas Wildfires

AUSTIN, Texas -- Wildfire survivors in Houston, Leon and Travis counties can meet with state and federal specialists at recovery centers opening in area communities this week.
Starting Thursday, specialists from the state of Texas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Small Business Administration will be on hand to answer questions and provide information on the types of assistance available to survivors. They also have brochures and other written materials on disaster recovery.
The schedule is:
Houston and Leon Counties Centerville/Leon County Annex II 155 S. Cass, 3rd floor Centerville, TX 75833 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 22 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday, Sept. 23 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24
Travis County Fire Station #2 801 Bee Creek Road Briarcliff, TX 78669 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. Friday, Sept. 23  9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 24
Any Texas survivor who has questions about the recovery process or who needs help registering with FEMA is urged to stop by a center. Visiting with a recovery specialist is not a requirement for survivors who want disaster assistance, but the centers are an excellent way for people to get answers to their questions about disaster aid and help applying for it.
Texans can register online at www.disasterassistance.gov, via web-enabled phone at m.fema.gov, or by telephone via FEMA's toll-free numbers: 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or TTY 1-800-462-7585. Those who use 711-Relay or Video Relay Services can call 1-800-621-3362. Operators are available by phone from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. seven days a week.

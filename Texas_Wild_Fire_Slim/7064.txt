Djokovic fights back three times to stun Federer in U.S. Open semis By      Chris Chase




Three times on Saturday afternoon, Novak Djokovic looked finished. Three times he held off defeat to cap a thrilling, furious, stunning, use-whatever-adjective-you-can-think-of semifinal comeback against five-time U.S. Open champion Roger Federer, 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 7-5.
First: Federer got out to a two-set lead. Looking like the Federer of old, that magician who won five-straight titles last decade and made hitting a forehand look as natural as checking your wristwatch, the 30-year-old Swiss took an early lead over the world No. 1. It's not that Novak was flat; it's that Federer was as sharp as he was earlier in this year in their French Open semifinal, the only completed match Djokovic has lost this year.
Djokovic isn't known for his five-set comebacks and Federer had only lost one Grand Slam match in his career while getting up two sets. Surely Djokovic was done.
Second: Serving at 3-4 in the final set, Djokovic was pushed wide by a Federer forehand. He lunged for it on the right singles line, got it back to Federer, who then rifled it back for an easy forehand winner. The New York crowd, pro-Federer from the outset, erupted with a cheer not heard at the USTA National Tennis Center since Jimmy Connors was running down overheads 20 years ago. U.S. Open crowds have never been warm to Djokovic. Now, they were totally against him. Sarcastically, Djokovic looked up at the crowd and mock clapped for them, striking his left hand against his racquet frame and nodding in petulant defiance.
Federer broke to go up 5-3 and serve for the match. With ease, Djokovic had come back from two sets down to force a fifth and deciding set. He has never responded well to hostile crowds (see: French Open, 2010) and his anger, mixed with that break, mixed with Federer's return to serving form surely meant Djokovic was done this time.
Third: Federer served at 40-15 in the next game. Match point. It was all over but the celebrating. In the booth, John McEnroe previewed Monday's Federer final. Writers started their columns on Federer's comeback from a comeback. He served. The ball bounced wide and Djokovic took one step to the right, pulled his racquet back ever-so-slightly and ripped a crosscourt forehand for the winner. The crowd erupted in a cheer, probably thinking the same thing that McEnroe was. "Good for him for losing well." They were applauding the nobility of defeat.
 
(Watch the clip as long as you'd like, or stop it after the point.)
This was the same Novak Djokovic who was 62-2 on the season? The guy who had won two Grand Slams, overtaken Rafael Nadal at No. 1 and set a course to have one of the greatest seasons in tennis history. Losing well? Djokovic doesn't lose, period.
He basked in the applause, raising his arms to soak it in. Federer lost the next point, this time on his accord. Djokovic broke, held serve, broke again and served out the match. It was the second straight year he defeated Roger Federer in a U.S. Open semifinal after saving two match points.
Three times he was on the brink of defeat and three times he came back. Novak Djokovic the fighter. You know who loves fighters? New York. Could there be a new king of Queens?

0 users disliked this comment HenryDavidT 39 minutes ago Report Abuse This is just another "writing on the wall" that the Roger era is about over.   When he was in his mid 20s, with 2 sets up and 2 match points, he could have played with his left hand and still won.

And it's not only that Roger's "getting old," at 30+; it is also that Novak is also re-asserting himself at the very top, playing supremely exceptional tennis.

Tennis is a real athletic sport where every cellular movement, at every second, counts, for you or against you; it is not a business-oriented game like golf, where someone over 45 could still beat a 24 year-old, because all it is requires is that you hit a ball as hard as you could, as accurate as it is possible to hit it, getting it to fall into a small hole, all by yourself, against yourself, without someone just as good hitting the small ball really hard, AT you, a ball which you have to return in a fraction of a second, just as hard or harder...

7 users disliked this comment Gregory 2 hours ago Report Abuse I can't believe the hatred that I read on some of these posts!!! Some people insulting Federer.

Roger Federer is a classy guy. No doubt he loves to win. He's competitive. But it's poor sportsmanship on Jockitch's part when taunting Roger (by flaunting his winning shot to the crowd) after saving the first match point. He was not "basking in the applause." He was feeding the pressure. At 40-30, that irked Roger. I think Roger should have been able to block it out but the pressure must've been too much.

Roger mentions that in the post-game interview.

I recall when Robin Soderling eliminated Nadal in the French. Imagine going up against a guy that you wanna beat so bad because of personality differences. It would be like playing an opponent that screams so loud on every hit that you wanna just destroy something. ANNOYING would be an understatement.

How many rivals do you know hang out like bosom buddies off court. Roger picks up Nadal at the airport to go to an exhibition match in Roger's hometown. That's a class act!

Now put yourself in Roger's shoes and play pro tennis for 13 years, coming home to a family, twins, and sustaining athletic excellence in a super-competitive sport. Give credit where credit is due. To be in the top 10 of tennis is phenomenal. To maintain it in the top seeds of the top ten is EXCEPTIONAL.

I see he has character. A guy like Roger could be doing the Tiger thing. (I hope he's not). But for him to be so committed to his wife, and daughters is a quality of character that is rare in this world. Especially in pro whatever. Keep fighting Roger!!! You have captured more than a trophy and titles. You have captured the hearts of your fans. AO 2012!!!

0 users disliked this comment Free 2 hours ago Report Abuse Roger is simply under pressure because of the idea of not being the goat or even the best of his era....I know when everyone loses his hope on Rog. that is the time that he will emerge victorious again. for now it's just a series of bad luck, slow reflex maybe because of pressure, aging phiysic. I know that it is easier to play when you expecting to loose anyway than to play 1 or 2 good points to close out the match. That's what happened to Roger.

2 users disliked this comment Andri 2 hours ago Report Abuse Dude, Roger has won more tournaments than any other, he's the king of the tennis world. Why is it such a big thing now that he starts losing a bit more? One day even the biggest king will have to go. It has nothing to do with his personal life, or his thoughts, or his problems, or what ever. Where is Agassy? Is he not playing anymore because he had personal problems? Where is Navratilova? Hinggis? Graf? Borg? Becker? I'll tell you this: Once you made it to the top, there's nowhere else to go except down. And eventually everybody who made it to top will make it down again. It's a natural process of life on earth, every life, even tennis players.
So stop treating it as if it was this "Surprising" phenomenon, that Roger is losing more games than he used to. We knew that. He knew that. Everybody knows that. No biggy. It's always been like that, it will always stay like that.

0 users disliked this comment RDSKNROB 3 hours ago Report Abuse can anybody tell me why it is that   the #1lseed face the #3seed in the semis instead of the 4th seed.   It seems like the WTA is trying to make it as easy as possible for Nadal.   He has only had to beat one of them the entire yr if he was to win the events, while Roger and Novak have had to play each other in all the semis

2 users disliked this comment dark_gambit 3 hours ago Report Abuse Maybe Federers' era is over. At 30 he's deteriorating. But lets wait when Novak and Rafa reach 28-30. Lets see if they can play the way Roger can in that age. The record speaks itself. Still a thrilling match. Lets see who will win on monday. Good game for #1 and #3.

Roger's   face when he's playing (which is lovely) he shows no emotions what's so ever... And not to be rude but his wife, I forgot her name, always looks mad at the world!

What resilience and determination he showed in this match - both mental and physical.   Hope to see another thriller on Monday!   Hajde Nole!   Car si!

4 users disliked this comment annalivia 5 hours ago Report Abuse Ever since 2008 when Nadal beat him at Wimbledon, Federer has been all too human.   Other than beating a mentally weak Roddick in 2009 in Wimbledon and winning a French Open sans Nadal due to injury, Federer has been stuck in the mud.   Nadal has owned him, and now the Joker seems to have his number.   Makes one wonder if Roger is truly the GOAT.   His dominance came after Sampras and before Rafa and Djokovic -- in other words, during those years when he was piling up majors, Federer was never seriously challenged.   The losses to Del Potro in the US Open Final, to Djokovic in the semis for 2 years straight (blowing match point after match point both years) may hurt Fed's legacy.   How can you be the GOAT when you are not even the best of your own era?

8 users disliked this comment nick 6 hours ago Report Abuse Disappointing, this is the first time for Fed with no grand-slam in a year since he becomes a superstar.

he almost win the match, just bad luck Fed, he could have just close it off with an ace or un-returnable service just like in Paris

but he will get more slams no doubt - fresh start next season   - 2012. Good luck Feb!!!

for the final - Djoker will most likely to win it because Fed is the only man who can beat him and Feb is now out; unless Nadal comes up with something different...

Nadal - if he loses on Monday, he will start to know how it feels to keep losing the finals - especially the grand-slam finals to the same guy.   He was keep taking away Fed's slams, now it's his turn. But having said that,   go for Nadal on Monday.

as for Murray - what the hell is wrong with him, can't beat these top guys in majors, but can in other ones including masters series... he should win one by now otherwise will end up like Tim Henman...

Grass fire prompts evacuation in Grimes County


Tweet


















  
A grass fire has caused the evacuation of at least 60 Grimes County residents this afternoon, Sheriff Don Sowell said. 
Volunteer departments are on scene and the Texas Forest Service is en route to help with firefighters and air power. 
For now, the fire remains on the east side of F.M. 244 and the evacuation order affects anyone living on Jubilee Trail, Skillett Bend, River Oaks, Tuttle Road or Sunbelt Road. 
That order could expand. 
More information will be released as it becomes available.

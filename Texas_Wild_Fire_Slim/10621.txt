Mos Def will soon be the rapper formerly known as Mos Def.
At this weekend's "Rock the Bells" concert in New York City, where the musician performed with Talib Kweli, Mos Def revealed that he's retiring his name by the end of 2011. The new name? Yasiin. 
"I’m retiring the Mos Def name after 2011. I’m actually doing it," he told Sucker Free. "Mos Def is a name that I built and cultivated over the years, it’s a name that the streets taught me, a figure of speech that was given to me by the culture and by my environment, and I feel I’ve done quite a bit with that name and it’s time to expand and move on."

				I get it, it makes sense. His name is like a brand and that brand has moved on. He feels like the work he's producing now doesn't fit into that "old" brand. Whatever. It's like when Larry Fishburn became a SERIOUS actor and rebranded himself as LAWRENCE Fishburn. John Melloncamp was branded as COUGAR. Profession­al women who get married often don't change their names because they've already got a good brand going on with the name they have. So maybe it is all about business, so what. He's a business man. His music and his name are his business. Can't fault him for that. Go 'head Yasiin.

				As a Jew who's nothing like any of the Jews you see wearing their support for Israeli imperialis­m on their sleeves, I might humbly suggest you narrow the scope on that statement a little bit.  But whatever, I'm not especially offended.

On an unrelated note, thanks for clarifying the arabic, that was helpful.

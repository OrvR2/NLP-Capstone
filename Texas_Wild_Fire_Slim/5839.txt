 Chicago News












A man driving on the South Side early Monday was shot in the head -- but still managed to drive himself to a nearby hospital. 
The Chicago Tribune reports that the victim was a 36-year-old man, and was wounded in the 1300 block of East 74th Street about 12:03 a.m. The bullet was possibly fired from another vehicle. 
Despite his injury, the man was alert enough to drive himself to Jackson Park Hospital, which was about six blocks away, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. 
The man was later taken to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County and listed in serious condition. No arrests have been made, and a motive in the shooting was not immediately known.

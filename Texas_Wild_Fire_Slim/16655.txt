A left-hander, he has a soft touch and he can air it out, giving his receivers enough time to get the ball in stride, as indicated by two long touchdowns. He also has a little moxie, shown by his third-down run for a score when he tucked the ball under his arm and sprinted toward the end zone.]]>

She did not visit ground zero; she may return next year when the memorial is complete. Instead, she wanted to meet some of Evan's colleagues at the investment banking firm Sandler O'Neill & Partners, which lost 66 principals and employees when the south tower of the World Trade Center was struck by a hijacked jetliner.]]>

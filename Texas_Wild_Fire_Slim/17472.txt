Band-Aid Blister Cushions for Fingers & Toes, June 21, 2008

Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)


These bandages are rather pricey but they're indispensable for me.  I walk 20 miles/day and tend to get callouses/corns between my toes.  No other types of bandaids fit between my toes and these have amazing staying power.  They rarely come off on their own.  I can take baths for several days and they stay on.  I used them to hold on tiny callous cushions which tend to be knocked off by putting on and taking off shoes and socks or by the bedclothes when I sleep.  Highly recommend!

also good for fingers when you have to do a lot of writing, June 6, 2008


By Holly Ann  - See all my reviews


I'm practicing for a 3 day hand-written exam.  I layer 3 over my middle finger to cushion against the pen when I write.  The adhesive is great for this use - fingers don't sweat like runner's feet. The cushioning is just right.  The local Safeway and drugstore.com stopped carrying this product, so I'm awfully glad I could order it on Amazon.

This review is from: Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages, Advanced Healing Blister Cushions for Fingers & Toes, 8-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) (Health and Beauty)


I'm an older person, and my skin is thin, predisposing me to scratches and abrasions.  These bandages promote healing like no other I've used. Stay on for a long time through showers and hand washing. They don't just cover wounds; healing occurs with minimal or no scarring.  In addition to blisters and fingers and toes, they're a perfect size for small cuts. I only wish Band-Aid would manufacture more different sizes of these hydrocolloid bandages. I'm an R.N., and I know that hydrocolloid bandages have been used for a long time by wound care professionals, so when I saw them on the shelf, I tried them right away.  Funny thing--I don't remember seeing any newspaper, magazine, or other print ads for them.

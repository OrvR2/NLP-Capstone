Girl Scouts Offer Aid to Central Texas Wildfire Victims



Girl Scouts of Central Texas reports that Girl Scouts, volunteers and staff are responding to the massive wildfires that ravaged through Central Texas this past weekend. Donations are currently being accepted at the Kodosky Program Center in Austin and Camp Texlake is open to evacuees who may need shelter. Starting next week, Oak Hill Service Unit will show thanks to more than 100 firefighters by providing dinners to their local firehouses. Established in 2002, the initiative - known as the Firehouse Challenge - sets to feed every firefighter in the Austin, Round Rock and Georgetown area. The challenge will honor the memory and service of the 9/11 first responders and recognize the work of the Central Texas wildfire firefighters.The 2011 Texas wildfires are an ongoing series of wildfires that have burned over 3,582,000 acres across Texas. The fires have been particularly severe due to the ongoing 2011 Southern US drought covering the state. Exacerbating the problem is a unusual convergence of strong winds, unseasonably warm temperatures and low humidity. On Labor Day, 500 homes were destroyed in and around Bastrop, TX, by a particularly lethal wildfire. Firefighters from more than forty-three states have been involved in the operation to combat the fires.Our thoughts go out to anyone impacted by the Texas Wildfires.

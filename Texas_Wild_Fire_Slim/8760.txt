Ahead of the Bell: Analyst raises Take-Two outlookAP – Wed, Aug 31, 2011





NEW YORK (AP) — A Sterne Agee analyst on Wednesday said the release of the next installment in the best-selling "Grand Theft Auto" series, due next year, could drive publisher Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.'s earnings far beyond expectations.Analyst Arvind Bhatia said he's raising his sales estimate for the game to 17 million units and his fiscal 2013 earnings to between $2.12 per share and $2.50 per share. Other analysts appear to be on the same track as Bhatia: they are on average expecting earnings of $2.49 per share, according to FactSet.But Bhatia said Take-Two could easily sell 20 million to 25 million copies of the game, which would push earnings for $3 or $4 per share.That estimate is based on the 17 million copies of "Grand Theft Auto 4" sold in the year after it launched in April 2008. When the new installment launches, there will be more than three times as many Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 units in use in the target markets, Bhatia noted, so 17-million-copy estimate could prove conservative.Take-Two stock closed Tuesday at $13.14, up 44 cents, or 3.5 percent, on the day.

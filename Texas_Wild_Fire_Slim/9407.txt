Baseball has a hall of fame to honor its greatest players. So does football, basketball and, of course, rock 'n' roll. There is a hall of fame for Canadian cartoonists and even pinball. However, the sport known as "dog surfing" has been one activity that hasn't had a "hall" to honor its best and brightest.
But that changes on Sept. 11, when the first surfing pooch is inducted into the Surf Dog Hall of Fame as part of the Helen Woodward Animal Center’s Surf Dog Surf-A-Thon, the world's largest dog surfing event.
The lucky dog? He's Buddy, a 14-year-old Jack Russell terrier, who has been surfing with his owner, Bruce Hooker, off the coast of Ventura County, Calif., for the past 10 years.
In the process, he won numerous tournaments, including the first four Surf Dog Surf-A-Thons, and became the Fido face of dog surfing thanks to appearances on Animal Planet, Pet Star, ESPN, CNN, NBC and the CBS Morning Show.

Buddy the Surfing Dog, 14, is a Jack Russell Terrier who has been surfing for 10 years.
In the process, he's won numerous tournaments including the Helen Woodward Animal Center Surf Dog Surf-A-Thon, the world's largest dog surfing tournament four times. On Sept. 11, he will be the first dog inducted into the HWAC Surf Dog Hall of Fame.

In addition, Buddy helped Steve Jobs launch the iPad when his clip called "Wet and Woofy" was the featured video.
It's not a bad resume and Hooker is pleased that Buddy is getting recognized for doing something he loves.
"This honor is validation that Buddy's a good surfer," Hooker told HuffPost Weird News. "He's a special dog."
Former surf journalist Nedra Abramson, who now organizes the Surf Dog Surf-A-Thon, agrees, hence the decision to honor him as the first inductee.
"Buddy does it for the right reasons," she said. "He loves to surf -- and he does turns! It's like he's a reincarnated surfer. He's brought the sport great notoriety."
Need proof? This year marks the sixth year of the tournament and, in that time, the number of participating pooches has gone from 10 to 80, and Abramson credits Buddy playing a big part.
She hopes to add other dogs to the Surf Dog Hall in future years, and while there are no plans to build a shrine to the great surfing dogs of yore like the ones in Cooperstown, N.Y., or Dayton, Ohio, she plans to honor Buddy and future honorees in a room at the Helen Woodward Animal Center, an animal charity in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., that gets the proceeds from the event.
"We will also be giving Buddy a plaque and a banner, although he won't have to give a speech," she said. "He can bark if he wants."
Buddy's surfing style gets thumbs (and paws) up from his human counterparts, such as pro surfer and former world champion Guy Takayama, who has judged a few dog surfing events in the past.
"What sets Buddy apart is that he actually turns the board and manuevers it," he said. "He doesn't just sit on the board and ride the wave in straight.
Ten years ago, when Buddy first got on a board, Hooker never thought it would start this such a wave of popularity.
"I was teaching my son to boogie board and he lost the board and Buddy found it and jumped on it," he said. "My daughter pulled him on it and it progressed from there."
Getting a dog to surf isn't easy, he said. The dog has to want to go in the water.
"I see people who throw their dogs on a board and expect them to surf," he said. "That never works. I needed three separate training sessions before he was comfortable on the board, and learned to compensate for his weight.
Since then, Hooker and Buddy experimented with different sizes and styles of boards, even a remote-controlled board so Buddy could go out in the ocean on his own. The board that works best seems to be a 5-foot, 6-inch soft board.
Although Buddy sticks with smaller waves more associated with longer surfboards, he's surfed waves as big as five feet.
However, Peter Noll, who leads a San Diego-based group called SoCalSurfDogs, says the message of Buddy's success is more than just the fact he's a good surfer.

"The thing is, Buddy and [Hooker] didn't start dog surfing to win contests, but because they liked it," he said. "A dog has to enjoy being in the water and standing on an unstable board."
Because 14 is supposedly equivalent to 98 human years, the Sept. 11 Surf-A-Thon may not just be his day of glory, but also his last tournament.
"He still likes surfing so we'll do this one, but this may be the last time," Hooker said.
But Noll and Abramson say he is a major reason why dog surfing has become a growing sport with four major tournaments and more to come, such as one taking place in Ireland this fall.
Still, other surfing dogs may follow in his pawsteps, but Takayama says there may not be one like Buddy ever again.
"He sets the bar very high," Takayama said. "It's going to be hard to find another dog who can surf like him."
Hooker, for one, doesn't plan to try.
"I do have another Jack Russell terrier -- a girl. She has no interest," he said. "But I am not a dog surfing trainer. I am a surfer that had a dog that wanted to surf."

				MissMaizey­belle, I'm so sorry about your loss; it's so hard to say goodbye.  I hope you find some peace in knowing that Maizey and all the other pets waiting there are being well-cared for.  My dad, his longtime sweetheart and I had a deal to wait at Rainbow for each other and collect each other's cats and dogs. His sweetheart wondered who was caring for the pets while they were waiting there, and we all agreed the Bridge needed human caretakers­.  He and his sweetheart have passed on, and there's no way in h*ll they'd leave any animal behind, so  they're having a ball keeping all the fuzzies happy until their owners come.  I can also guarantee they're gonna spoil her terribly (in the unlikely event you didn't do that already.)

				I HATE seeing people force animals to do unnatural things for their entertainm­ent! Dogs do not want to surf in probably 99% of the cases. A dog will do almost anything to please his person, that does not mean he enjoys it.  I know I'll get negative blowback for saying this, but first try to think about what your dog actually enjoys doing before you make him do what YOU enjoy. Anything I say about animals comes from my heart which LOVES them and my years of observing animals.

				JRTs and most dogs want to play and be with their owners; as long as surfing is voluntary (and parents are nearby) I have no problems with it.  I had one cat who thought he was a dog...he'd follow me automatica­lly (even to my college classes, where he once slid in a window landing onto the lectern), play hide-and-s­eek or ball, and of course beg from anyone.

				Your sweet girl may have dementia. Ask your Vet for tips on making her feel more secure. I read that giving a senior dog a smaller space to occupy, such as one room with everything she needs to be comfy (water bowl, bed, etc..) helps with the confusion they experience­. Also, if/when you judge the time has come to help her "go on," you can ask your Vet to come to your home to "put her to sleep" my Vet did this for us and it made it so much less traumatic for both of us. My precious boy slipped away while I held him in my arms and told him "I love you" over and over. Good Luck and Best Wishes, K

				Thanks for your thoughts and advice.Mis­s Maizey Belle crossed the Rainbow Bridge at 10 am this morning. She was under the care of my vet, a neurologis­t and a cardiologi­st.As in my previous posts she has been great for the last 5 years on hermeds,bu­t had a breakthrus­eizure about 10 days ago,and didn't seem 2 recover.Th­edementia might have been age related but could have been caused by themeds she was on too.She gave me 17 years of love and laughter,w­he would not have wanted her present existance.­As devastatin­g as this morning is I know I did the right thing.Than­ks again for your kind words.

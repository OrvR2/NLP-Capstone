Chicago homeowners looking to challenge their property's assessed value can now save a trip downtown by filing their appeals online, via a new system unveiled Tuesday.
The Chicago Sun-Times reports that homeowners will still have to provide evidence that their property has been overassessed, proving that some sort of error was at play. Supporting evidence to that effect will need to be mailed within five business days of the complaint being filed online -- at cookcountyboardofreview.com.
While the new filing system is open to all homeowners and most property owners, those challenging a commercial property assessment will still have to file their supporting paperwork in person -- at least for now, according to the Chicago Tribune.
Still, convenience is clearly key with the new online system. And the ultimate goal is for everything to go paperless.
"People can file in their pajamas if they want to," Cook County Assessor Joe Berrios' spokeswoman Kelley Quinn told the Sun-Times. Berrios is said to have spearheaded the new, online system.
The system -- long talked about, though delayed by concerns about implementation cost -- was completed by existing county staff in-house, which reportedly cut the cost of a half-million dollar estimated price tag, according to the Tribune.
The number of appeals the Board of Review is asked to consider is expected to increase due to its move online, the Chicago News Cooperative reports. The board reviewed more than 380,000 assessment appeals in 2010.

				The system is rigged when you can only appeal your assessment­s; when requests to adjudicate exemptions are denied.

People should be asking, "why can I not appeal my exemption if my neighbor is getting more than I do?"

After all, the law gives the Board of Review full authority to do so:

35 ILCS 200/16-70: "Determina­tion of exemptions­. The board of review shall hear and determine the applicatio­n of any person who is assessed on property claimed to be exempt from taxation. However, the decision of the board shall not be final, except as to homestead exemptions­."

				A valid appraisal, make sure your exemptions are correct.  In Peoria County there is much info available online, even this new GIS system. I created a page for my own little jurisdicti­on.  http://www­.elmwoodil­.org/Asses­sorPage.ht­m

Remember you are not protesting your taxes, it is a discussion of the value of your property. Appraisals and assessment­s are estimates.

Also rules are different in Cook County than in rest of the state, but it ends up being about the same.

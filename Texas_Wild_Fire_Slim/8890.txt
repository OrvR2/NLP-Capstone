   Report Benchmarks Top U.S. Retailers on Support for In-Aisle MobilePRWeb – 9 hrs ago





   Which U.S. retailers are leading the charge in providing great in-aisle mobile experiences to smartphone-savvy consumers, and which are falling behind? A new report by digital agency White Horse benchmarks the top players.Portland, OR (PRWEB) September 07, 2011  As consumers increasingly rely on smartphones to aid and enhance their in-store shopping, a handful of top retailers are meeting this new demand with effective, integrated mobile experiences, while many more are falling behind, according to a new report by White Horse’s Digital Futures Group.
White Horse will introduce the report, "In-Store Mobile Scorecard: Industry Leaders and Laggards," in a webinar on September 14, and will make the full report available to attendees. The report evaluates the in-store mobile readiness of nine top U.S. retailers, including Walmart, CVS Caremark, Kroger, The Home Depot, Target, Walgreens, Best Buy, Lowe’s, and Safeway. Using a combination of secondary research, in-store audits, and heuristic analysis of current mobile experiences, White Horse benchmarked the retailers on nine criteria of progress toward in-aisle mobile, as well as four criteria measuring the criticality of in-aisle mobile to the brand’s success. 
White Horse found that top retailers fall into three distinct tiers of mobile readiness: Leaders, for whom fully formed in-aisle experiences are extensions of the brand identity, Experimenters, whose mobile experiments haven’t yet coalesced into a defined sense of purpose, and Learners, whose use of mobile tends to be tactical and focused on replicating the desktop web experience. The study uncovered opportunities for retailers to leapfrog into leadership positions by delivering mobile experiences that capitalize on core competencies and brand equities.
The report is a follow-up to the White Horse Digital Futures Group’s recent study, "The Future of In-Aisle Mobile: A Framework for Innovation," which features primary research on consumers’ use of mobile devices in store aisles. “Retailers who read that report asked to provide examples of what best practices for in-aisle mobile might look like,” said Will Reese, head of the Digital Futures Group. “This new report is an effort to provide that answer.”
Sign-up for the webinar is free and open to all at https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/439934838. Attendees will be the first to receive the published report in PDF format.

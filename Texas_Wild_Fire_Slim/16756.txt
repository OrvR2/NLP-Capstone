TECH COMPANY BUILDING HUGE SCIENCE GHOST TOWN
Posted: September 7th, 2011


 

STORY HIGHLIGHTS:
(HUFFINGTON POST) Pegasus Global, a Washington-based technology company, announced plans Tuesday to build a 20-square-mile model metropolis, or ghost town, in New Mexico.
The project is being called a petri dish the size of a large U.S. city. The tech company plans to use ghost town to test everything from renewable energy innovations to intelligent traffic systems and next-generation wireless networks.
The replica city would be capable of supporting a population of 350,000. Pegasus Global CEO Bob Brumely says the $200 million project will be a first of its kind in the U.S. and could create a Silicon Valley of sorts in New Mexico.

Take This Regret by  Amy Lichtenhan


Posted on 7/28/2011 08:52:00 PM



There are some mistakes we make that we will regret for the rest of our lives.  For Christian, it was the day he betrayed Elizabeth.

Christian Davison has a plan for his life.  He is determined to become an attorney and to one day take his place as partner in his father’s law firm.  Nothing will stand in his way, not even Elizabeth Ayers and their unborn child.

After Christian cuts her from his life, Elizabeth spends the next five years struggling to provide for her daughter and willing to sacrifice anything to give her child a safe, comfortable life. 

For five years, Christian has regretted the day he walked away from his family and will do anything to win them back just as Elizabeth will do anything to protect her daughter from the certain heartache she believes Christian will bring upon them.

When Christian wrestles his way into their lives, Elizabeth is faced with asking herself if it is possible to forgive someone when they’ve committed the unforgivable and if it is possible to find a love after it has been buried in years of hate.  Or are there some wounds that go so deep they can never heal?

They say everyone deserves a second chance.

In The Hands of Grace by Dianne Greco


Posted on 6/30/2011 08:38:00 PM



Susan Appleton is a woman who married well, lived the life of plenty, and loses most of it when her husband Harry is killed in a car accident. She manages to walk away from the lap of luxury and her husband’s greedy family with some insurance money, a summer cottage on eastern Long Island and her well-paying, highly stressful job as an assistant gem broker in Manhattan’s Diamond District.

Then, she is fired, the victim of office politics and downsizing.

Once again, she is forced to cope with a sudden, unwelcome change. During the weeks that follow, she is bombarded with constant worries—her teenage son Chris, her finances, and her job prospects. She also faces the long unanswered questions she has avoided since her husband’s death.  Who was he with at the business meeting on the night he was killed?

When she meets up with her neighbor Grace Burton on the very day she is fired, Susan is amazed at how safe she feels around her. With Grace’s friendship and clairvoyant gifts, Susan learns the value of simple pleasures. She also meets Tom, a local handy man, who has a talent for fixing a lot more than a broken screen door. He just may be the one to mend her broken heart.

In just a few weeks, Susan realizes how blessed she is in the face of adversity and learns to appreciate all the amazing “coincidences” she is experiencing in the hands of Grace.

When literature student Anastasia Steele is drafted to interview the successful young entrepreneur Christian Grey for her campus magazine, she finds him attractive, enigmatic and intimidating.  Convinced their meeting went badly, she tries to put Grey out of her mind - until he happens to turn up at the out-of-town hardware store where she works part-time. 

The unworldly, innocent Ana is shocked to realize she wants this man, and when he warns her to keep her distance it only makes her more desperate to get close to him.  Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her - but on his own terms.

Shocked yet thrilled by Grey's singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success – his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving adoptive family – Grey is man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a passionate, physical and daring affair, Ana learns more about her own dark desires, as well as the Christian Grey hidden away from public scrutiny.

Can their relationship transcend physical passion? Will Ana find it in herself to submit to the self-indulgent Master?  And if she does, will she still love what she finds?

Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.

Somewhere between the first twinkling of stars in the night sky and the break of dawn, two souls from two unique worlds collide, creating an everlasting supernova.

Kerrigan Cruz and Dominic Grayson are among the chosen few who have the gift, or the curse, of being able to walk between two worlds.  It is on the cusp of where these beings meet that everything changes, and life as they know it is turned upside down. Fantasy becomes reality and what shouldn’t be, is.  

Forced by destiny, their chance encounter is breathed to life by the one thing that can make even the most impossible of impossibilities a reality.  Something so complex in nature, yet as simple as a flicker of thought to exercise. Most normal people go about their everyday lives never even suspecting its existence. But it is out there…it is the Light.

The universe has granted the power of the Light to a chosen bloodline charged with the responsibility of protecting our right to choose our destiny. But in the shadows, darkness wreaks havoc in the lives of the unsuspecting. Yes, another world does exist, and it holds secrets beyond what the most vivid imagination can comprehend.

Supernova:  His curse. Her gift. Their destiny.

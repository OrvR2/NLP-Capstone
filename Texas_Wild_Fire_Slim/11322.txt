At the Republican debate Wednesday night, the fireworks came quickly between Gov. Rick Perry and the man he replaced as the frontrunner for the Republican party's presidential nominee: Mitt Romney.
The topic of contention was, as it has been for several days now, job creation. Romney argued that a career politician wasn't the right resume to have to turn the country around, and Perry responded by noting that Romney, while in the private equity world, did a good job creating jobs... overseas.
Then it turned a more personal.
"States are different," Romney said, of the notion that Perry's management of Texas showed his prowess as a job creator. "Texas is a great state. Texas has zero income tax, [it's] a right to work state, [with] a republican legislature ... a lot of oil and gas in the ground ... Those are wonderful things. Governor Perry didn't create those things. If he tried to say that it would be like Al Gore saying he invented the Internet."
Perry, famously, worked on Al Gore's 1988 presidential campaign.
"Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did Mitt," Perry responded.
"George Bush and his predecessor created jobs at a faster rate than you did," Romney replied.
"That's not correct," Perry said.

Perry, famously, worked on Al Gore's 1988 presidenti­al campaign.

"Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did Mitt," Perry SNORTED/re­sponded.

"George Bush and his predecesso­r created jobs at a faster rate than you did," Romney Blaaaa/rep­lied.

"That's not correct," Perry said ... "SNIFF!"

				Cain has a 9/9/9 plan. Thats 9% national sales tax, 9% income tax and 9% corp tax... no cap gains or dividend taxes.. the major income of the rich..  Add the additional 7% private soc sec tax to that on the middleclas­s.

Under his plan a Warren Buffet goes from  16% to almost zero plus the tax on what he buys , which will not be 45 million of his income. But 100% of middleclas­s income and the poors income is spent ( including taxing retirment income of the lederly that was already subject to income taxes when they earned the money). This will increase our poor distributi­on of wealth, already the worst of developed nations, that destroys demand and the economy, just as in the great depression and now.

Now how you can make up for all the loss of corp and the rich tax income is beyond me!

Remember that the avg family of 4 makes just 53K. No interest deductions­, no child credits , no earned income tax credits, just a poor middleclas­s made poorer, who can afford less goods and thus less demand and the creation of an even biiger aristocrac­y that owws government whihc ends democracy as now and under the robber barons.  Yes, the tax code needs to ne redone, especially the corp taxes( which repug did nothing about when they controlled congress and the WH for most of the last decade.

				Perry was well-rehea­rsed but normal people don't want to hear what he's selling.  They don't want to hear that social security is a ponzi scheme and he keeps saying it over and over.  Romney won the day when the said he would make social security stronger - not take it away.  I don't see what everyone is bragging about with perry - he stands around boasting about his state while it burns to the ground and he defunded his fire depts by 75 percent!  Think people - this guy is just phony window dressing!

				In 1964 at the ripe old age of 15, I campaigned for Goldwater. never voted for a Democrat until 1992.

In the begiining Soc Sec was a "PONZI" scheme because existing seniors and those for the next 25 years didnt pay in all their lives!   The first having paid nothing in and thus the need for much higher worker to retiree ratios.

They grandfathe­red in.. because under repug robber baron/tric­kle down economics, there was no union pension funds, no private pensions funds(they were structured so no one would vest but management when even offered).

Thus there was no retirement funds for almost all of America any more than there was healthcare for most seniors(or most americans before unions). Where were the states/ private business then?

The great depression had like now wiped out much of the countries savings.

Those retiring now have paid in their entire lives, the ratio of workers to retires has stayed constant for decades at 3 to one.

Repubs said in 1968 that socsec would be bankrupt by 1980.  They were wrong!  When I was 24  and those even older were told by repubs it wouldnt be here when we retired. Well they and I our now collecting socsec. AND GIVEN THATS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SELL MY REAL ESTATE AND MY SEP FUNDS THANKS TO WALLSTREET ARE WORTH HALF WHAT THEY WERE IN 2001 IN CONSTANT DOLLARS..I­TS A GOOD THING.

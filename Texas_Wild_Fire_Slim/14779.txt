It’s Ennis, not Dallas, thanks
You just couldn’t get around this weekend without tripping over a race fanatic. Even the most racing-illiterate resident of Ennis knows why.

Flu prevention  is common sense
With so much news going around about H1N1 flu these days, it is reasonable to be concerned.

Future trends for education
One of the most enjoyable parts of being an educator is that we not only get to predict the future, but have a responsibility to try to do so. Happily, lots of people who work in education are practiced professionals at “futurism” so those of us in the trenches have a lot of help. It [...]

By Associated Press
MONTREAL — A 36-year-old man has been charged after he allegedly broke into singer Celine Dion's home near Montreal, raided the fridge and even took the time to pour himself a bath, police said Tuesday.
He was nabbed by police in the Montreal suburb of Laval on Monday afternoon after the alarm system went off.
The international pop superstar and her husband, Rene Angelil, were not at home at the time. Dion and Angelil usually live in Florida but use the Laval residence when they come home to Quebec.
Laval police spokesman Franco Di Genova said the suspect was getting ready to take a nice hot bath when police arrived with a canine unit.
"He opened the water faucets, was pouring a nice warmish bath (and) he even managed to eat some pastry that was in the fridge," Di Genova said.
Di Genova said police worked their way through the house, starting with the basement and finally confronted the man on the main floor.
 "The suspect was coming down the big staircase and was asking: `Hey, guys what are you doing here?'" Di Genova said.
"So the officers replied: `What are you doing here?' and they proceeded to put him under arrest."
Di Genova said the man had jumped a fence to get on the property and used a garage door opener that he found in an unlocked vehicle to gain access to the luxury residence.
Daniel Bedard, a Laval resident, was arraigned Tuesday on charges including breaking and entering, auto theft and causing property damage.
Di Genova said there was another incident at Dion's mansion in 2009 when another man jumped the fence, but was stopped by the security firm that was keeping an eye on the property before he could enter the home.

				LOL yeah he actually broke into Celine Dion's house who would waste time doing that. Taking a bath does sort of make sense especially after breaking in you would need one NASTY.

				The intruder was 'pouring a nice warmish bath'.  Thanks for sharing with us the bath's water temperatur­e, Mr. police spokesman.  Unless you're a penguin or polar bear, most baths do tend to be on the warm side.

				I came across this Celine Dion Quote:

“Oh, they're stealing 20 pair of jeans or they're stealing television sets. Who cares? They're not going to go too far with it. Maybe those people are so poor, some of the people who do that they're so poor they've never touched anything in their lives. Let them touch those things for once.”

There you go, Celine, Daniel Bedard heard you and he touched all your things.  You OK with that?

				what's so bizarre about someone having a bite to eat and then wanting to take a bath?  I'd guess millions of people do those 2 things in that same sequence daily (but usually in their own homes of course)

				I see the Associated Press, a long standing bastion of profession­al journalism­, is no longer immune to amateurs. No one ever "pour himself a bath." A bath is drawn. I suppose if one lives somewhere without running water, a bucket and a washtub might be used, but I'm fairly certain that Celine Dion has running water in her home.

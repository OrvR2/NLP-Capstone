#rsrh The Green Rhetorical Disconnect, Part 65 (NSFW)

Scenario: a six year old boy in Quebec is excluded from entering a drawing for a stuffed bear because his parents used a Ziploc bag to store his sandwich (Ziploc bags are apparently worse than Tupperware, theologically speaking).  When the parents contacted the school, the teacher presumed to lecture them on the subject, presumably because said teacher felt it necessary to subject other people to her own religious views.  Needless to say, at no point is it actually explained why the specific punishment for this ‘transgression’ was necessary for the child’s development; in fact, it is unclear that the teacher would have been able to explain the rationale behind the transgression in the first place*.  Nonetheless, a message was made.

What the intent of the message was: It is very, very important to make sure that even the smallest act of heresy and Gaia-hatred be vigilantly defended against.  It is regrettable that this must sometimes result in a small child crying in shame and confusion because he does not have the vocabulary to explain the rigorous rules of his school life to his parents, but that is a small price to pay for stopping the malignant spread of Ziploc bags.

What the actual message was: Greenies are assholes.

#rsrh A handy primer on the Sanchez sisters.

Because it’s going to be confusing.

Loretta Sanchez is the Congresswoman from California who tried to vulture fellow-Democrat Gabby Giffords off of the powerful House Armed Services Committee; who race-baited her Vietnamese-American opponent last year; and who has been turning PMA contributions into PMA earmarks for years now.
Linda Sanchez is the Congresswoman from California (sister to Loretta) who thinks that the majority of the population of the United States is made up of white supremacists*; who crafted a bill attacking First Amendment rights in such a way so as to make roughly 95% of the blogosphere potential felons; and whose first action as Ethics Ranking Member should be to recuse herself (due to a conflict of interest) from the Ethics Committee’s investigation of Maxine Waters.
If you’re trying to remember which Sanchez sister was the one that got the Pelosi-era Ethics Committee to whitewash a violation of House rules about hiring other Members of Congress’ staffers as a favor, it’s a trick question, of course: they both were.

I hope that this helps.  One heck of a political dynasty that these two are building for themselves, huh? – And here I thought that the Carnahans were… suboptimal.

*Yes.  It was fun to watch her have to retract that.  No doubt seething all the while.

Movie of the week: Red.

Red was one of those flicks that I actually got to see in theaters; it was cleverly done, had an excellent cast – it takes real skill to screw up a movie that has Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren in it – and the plot was surprisingly sweet, considering the amount of explosions.
Quite a lot of explosions.  And automatic weapons fire.  Can’t have too much automatic weapons fire in a movie, in my opinion.
Anyway, that’s it for The Eagle Has Landed.

#rsrh Annnnnnnnnnd Mubarak might as well start packing.

The Egyptian army has announced that protesters’ complaints (which include ‘Mubarak is still leading this country’) are legitimate, and that the army will not fire on them.  I’m not precisely tied into the relevant inner circle or anything, but what I’ve heard from people familiar with the Egyptian military is that they’re ready for a power change, just as long as it doesn’t result in a hardline Islamist government.
If it’s the army and the civilians against the cops and the government apparatus, well, now is a good time for members of the latter to start buying their plane tickets.  And it’s cheaper in the long run to just let ‘em go.

#rsrh Rep. Lynch (D, MA) to base: shut up and sit down.

More like blue-on-blue than red-on-red (it is one of the great ironies of American politics that these days the Right is designated as red while the Left has blue, to both side’s secret annoyance.  Or not-so-secret annoyance) – still, Weasel Zippers (H/T: …somebody) is correct: watching Establishment Democrats try to get their base under control is pretty funny.
Let me give you the gist of the article: Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, still smarting over the way that the dirty, smelly union hippies (I paraphrase) dared to challenge him in the last election primary, came out to tell progressives that their refusal to rubber-stamp incumbent Democrats cost the party eight seats, so shut up.  This did not, as they say, go over well: particularly funny was watching DCCC chair (read: “designated scapegoat for 2012″) Steve Israel practice the arcane art of sounding confident and declarative while at the same time saying nothing at all, but the progressives made up for that lack of semantic content with… an entirely different lack of semantic content.

Re-Meet Michael Williams (R CAND, SEN-TX Primary).

Long-time readers of RedState are familiar with Michael Williams, of  course: he was of the candidates for replacing Senator Hutchison, back  when she looked ready to vacate her Senate seat.  Now that she’s  retiring, Michael is officially running for Senate.  We talked last  week:

Michael was until quite recently a Texas Railroad Commissioner, which (as Texas Railroad Commissioners  soon learn to explain, over and over and over again) has nothing to do  with Texas railroads; it actually oversees Texas energy policy, which is  why it’s an elected position.  His Senate campaign site is here.

‘Don’t Stand So Close To Me.’


Don’t Stand So Close To Me, The Police
Actually, it’s more depressing than you think.  Not only is this song legal, it’s old enough to have a kid.

The new Thundercats images are worrisome.

I was expecting more of Teh Suckage; but this is… pretty good.

I say ‘worrisome’ because the current business model for remakes these days seems to be ‘rape your customer base’s collective childhood*;’ and if things aren’t so bad here, well, what pitfalls await us?

*There’s a reason why the article text and I independently came up with the same comment, you know. (more…)

#rsrh Is Debbie Stabenow (D, MI) vulnerable?

…Maybe.
The most important thing to take away from this highly preliminary and definitely partisan poll is that it shows Senator Debbie Stabenow’s (D, MI) numbers being below 50%.  This is somewhat surprising, given that she did not have a particularly hard time of it in 2006; then again, 2006 was a bad year for a Republican to be challenging a Democratic incumbent (to put it mildly).   However, since 2006 the unemployment rate has more or less doubled (just like everywhere else, really); if Stabenow had been up for  election last year she would probably have been thrown out of office  alongside a good number of her fellow Democrats.  If she wants to survive 2012 Stabenow had better start hoping that the economy improves*.
H/T Taegan Goddard, whose comment section is by the way being highly entertaining in its Democratic members’ inability to grasp that Michigan is the state where the GOP just swept the executive branch, cemented its control over the state Senate, flipped the State House, and now has a majority of federal Congressional seats.  It’s not enemy territory for Democrats.  Yet.  But it’s certainly at least not under their control, which will be… interesting for an administration that may be perhaps not experienced in adjusting their campaigning style to reflect reduced resources.
*I think that we have had it demonstrated by now that federal Democrats are singularly inept at making the economy improve.

President to doom gun control.

President Obama’s going to be starting a push for “gun control” next month, sayeth insiders – which is a statement that would worry me more if the President hasn’t been a bit of a jinx at using the bully pulpit up to this point.  I’m trying – and failing – to come up with something where his “assistance” has been a net positive: all of the Democrats’ dubious legislative successes have been on the Congressional level thus far, and when it comes to skill at advocacy Obama, well, sucks. One wonders what the man hopes to accomplish.
And no, I don’t know what the heck “gun control” has to do with the economy, either.

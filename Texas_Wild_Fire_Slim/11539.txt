A spotlight from the 9/5 WC with Jenndur ~ yesmrcullen’s Rain Falls Down


Posted by jenn on 9/05/2011 10:54:00 PM



Here’s a spotlight on one of the authors who participated in the 9/5 WC hosted by Jenndur.A teaser from Chapter 11 of yesmrcullen’s story, Rain Falls Down:We walked into Charlie’s house and I headed toward the kitchen to check on the ingredients for dinner. Sure enough, there was only a pound of ground beef in the freezer, no noodles or pasta sauce. Edward had offered to go to the store. While he was gone, I did some last minute cleaning and saw my keepsake box still on the dining table.I took a couple of deep breaths, staring at the box, debating if I was ready. I had no idea why I was so hesitant, already knowing what was inside. I pulled the box closer to me and slowly lifted the top until it was completely open to me. I carefully lifted my three diaries out and laid them on the table, spotting the pink mound of tissue that had been underneath. I picked up the bundle, remembering what lie between the layers and slowly unwrapped until the golden treasure Edward bought me for my sixteenth birthday was revealed.My mind flashed back to the day he gave me the necklace. He had told me that no matter what, I should remember to always love and forgive. He had the words Love No Matter inscribed on the back, so I wouldn’t forget. On the front, was a simple carving of a heart.My heart raced as I remembered the way his fingers had brushed against my neck as he placed it around my neck, causing my skin to tingle. The way he tenderly kissed me on my lower cheek before I turned my head, touching his lips to mine and catching him off guard. He smiled and kissed me gently once more before Esme walked outside, interrupting our intimate moment. Later that night, after everyone had gone to sleep, I crept into his room, and he held me for hours while we talked. That night was the first time he told me he loved me.

Spotlight from 26/07 WC with Chelle :~ gredelina1 Hunger


Posted by Chelle on 7/26/2011 02:35:00 PM



Spotlight from July 26th WC with Chellegredelina1's Hunger“Hi, Bella,” Ben said. “Mike ran out of sodas, and I being the sober one went to the store to get more. I was approached by some guy asking about you.”“Some guy came up to you, asking about me?” Bella said.“Yes, he had apparently heard about the party and thought you might be here. He seemed kind of weird, though, and I wasn’t sure you knew him, so I didn’t tell him where you were.”“Thanks, Ben,” Bella said, and gave him a smile.“Sure,” he said, feeling very protective of her. I realized that they’d gotten closer since the last time I had met him, and I was glad that Bella had friends who were looking out for her.“He asked me if I could give you a letter and handed me this envelope,” Ben said, and Bella took it from him with a feeling of dread. She hid it well, though, and thanked him again. He turned around and went to find Angela. Bella stood frozen, staring at the envelope in her hand. Edward went up to her and gently put his arm around her shoulder, guiding her away towards a quieter place, Alice and I following behind them.“Bella, do you want me to open it?” Edward asked.She looked at him, confusion clear in her eyes. “Does it smell from vampire?” she asked, and Edward nodded. “But, why would a vampire give me a letter?”“I don’t know, love,” Edward said softly. “Why don’t you let me open it to find out?” She narrowed her eyes at him, and he quickly added, “I’ll read it out loud, I promise.” She nodded her consent and Edward ripped the envelope open.As soon as he opened it, Alice gasped and slipped into a vision. Edward growled and I couldn’t take it anymore. I yanked the envelope away from him and looked inside. There wasn’t a letter in it, though, but pictures. Pictures of a broken human, obviously tortured before killed. Across one of the pictures, eight words were written; See what happens to people you love, Bella?

Spotlight from 12/07 WC with Chelle: mcgt's Behind the Velvet Rope


Posted by Chelle on 7/12/2011 03:25:00 PM



Spotlight from the 12/07 WC with Chellemcgt's Behind the Velvet RopeShaking his head minutely, Felix told me wordlessly that now was not the time to discuss Alec’s mysterious disappearance. Edward’s voice crackled in our ears, telling us that we’d have to speak with him when our shift was over to give him the full run down of the situation. Rolling his eyes, Felix explained, “Every time there’s an incident, we have to do a full report on it so that the fine upstanding gentlemen who we just threw out of here won’t have a leg to stand on should they try to sue us. It’s all pretty standard, but since we have to be rough sometimes, we don’t want someone with a hangover getting p****d off at the bruises on his biceps that we left the previous night.Getting back to the VIP section, there were a few people standing around waiting for us to let them in. Felix handled their entrance efficiently until it came to a shaggy haired dude he addressed as Jasper.“Jasper my man. How are things? What are you doing slumming it here with the likes of us?” Felix’s jovial personality switched on in an instant as the two men bro hugged. Turning towards me, Felix introduced him to me as his good buddy Jasper and Edward’s roommate.Why would Edward need a roommate? The guy had to be making bank working here.“Emmett. Nice to meet you.” Shaking hands firmly, we both sized each other up.“Go on up, J-man. I’ll let Edward know you’re in Fire. Catch you later,” Felix remarked, pulling back the velvet rope and allowing the lanky man to pass.Once he’d ascended the stairs, Felix gave me the run down on our bosses couch surfer. Seems Jasper was a struggling musician who thanks to Edward’s generosity crashed at his place between gigs. Felix promised to take me to see one of his shows on our nights off, telling me that the man was quite talented, but hadn’t gotten his big break, like so many others in the city of struggling actors, musicians, artist and well, just about any profession. New York was the city where people came with a dream. Bankers, artists, it didn’t matter if you wore a suit or a guitar; everyone came here baring their soul to follow their dream.

A spotlight from the 6/29 WC with KitsuShel ~ Katmom's Dragon Stones


Posted by Shel on 6/30/2011 01:48:00 PM



Here’s a spotlight on one of the authors who participated in the 6/2p WC hosted by KitsuShel.
A teaser from katmom's story, Dragon Stones: 


To no one’s surprise, Jasper and Alice had announced that they were together just a week after Brenith broke shell.  They were bound just as closely as their dragons were. I tried not to feel jealous over the fact that they could be together openly.  She was almost nineteen, nearly two years past the age of consent. No one questioned their status because of age.  I had heard the whispers of some when Edward and I were working together.  He never seemed to notice and I did my best to not hear them. I tried not to let it rankle when older girls would approach him and would try to entice him to meet privately with them.  My ire was appeased slightly when he never took them up on their offers while I was around.I never saw him with any other woman, Rider or not, and he spent every night curled up on Volterra’s forearms next to where I slept with ShayTan.  I did notice the way he looked at me.  It seemed warmer than the glances he gave other woman and I hoped that it meant something.  It certainly sent warm shivers down my spine. Alice had been annoyed when Tanyara had approached Jasper shortly after they made their status known.  She never told me what transpired between herself and the Bond of her dragon’s dam, but one day she invited Tanyara into Brenith’s cavern and closed the door. Fifteen minutes later a red cheeked Tanyara had exited the cavern, mounted her dragon and hadn’t come back for hours.  I never saw her glance at Jasper in that predatory way again.  My guess is that Alice may have displayed some of that magic that had protected the dragons and herself to the pushy Rider.

A spotlight from the 6/27 WC with Jenndur ~ burntcore’s Theory of Love


Posted by jenn on 6/29/2011 06:38:00 PM



Here’s a spotlight on one of the authors who participated in the 6/27 WC hosted by Jenndur.A teaser from Burntcore's upcoming story, Theory of Love:Alice looked at me with a smirk. I instantly knew something was up. She didn't smirk like that unless I was about to be embarrassed. "So, Miss Associate Professor Swan, what took you so long in the Music building?"I blushed, my cheeks reddening. I hadn't drunk enough to blame it on the alcohol either. "Er, nothing. I just got lost." I had gotten lost alright, lost in thatmusician's beautiful music."Oh, bullshit," Alice retorted with a snort. "That building isn't that confusing to navigate. Are you sure there wasn't anything, like a hot teacher or something?"The b*tch was always so perceptive. It was like she was psychic. I took another sip of my beer and tried to sort out my thoughts. I didn't want to give Alice any indication that I was interested in this man. For all I knew, he could've been a student that was already on campus."There was someone playing in one of the practice rooms and the music was so beautiful, I just had to stop and listen to it. Before I knew it, you were texting me to see where I was."I thought my explanation would be enough to satisfy Alice. I was wrong.She peered at me, that smirk still on her face. I think she knew something more than she was letting on."Did you get a look at who it was?" she asked.I shook my head. "His back-""It was a guy, I knew it!" she crowed, nearly spilling her beer.I leveled a look at Alice. "Really, Alice? I heard the music long before I saw who was playing, so I had no idea it was a man until I was standing outside of the practice room."Alice tried to act contrite but the corners of her lip quivered as she fought to smile."Anyway, his back was to me. He was playing a gorgeous black, grand piano. The man was so into his music that he never knew I was there ... until my phone buzzed when you texted me.""So what happened?" Alice asked excitedly.

Spotlight from 14th June WC with Chelle:~ Lizmonfaine's Seattle's Most


Posted by Chelle on 6/14/2011 01:35:00 PM



Teaser from the 14th June WC with ChelleLizmondaine's Seattle's Most To: Bella SwanFrom: Renee SwanSent: November 28, 2010 1:45:21PMSubject: That awful girl!I know that you’re on a weekend get away, so you’re very likely not seeing this, but I have attached a copy of her nasty little article. I take back everything I said about thinking she was witty and liking her column. She’s mean, spiteful, and just plain nasty.Just read it for yourself.Hope you’re having fun!Love, MomP.S. I bet she’s ugly too, isn’t she?Small Town Sheriff is a Big Time Fraud...If you ask any of the inhabitants of the small town of Forks what they think about their current sheriff they are all quick to sing his praises, and spout all the good that he has done for their tiny, little town. However, what they don’t know about hometown hero Charles Swan is his secret past while he was away for four years at college. Well, as is my duty, I have the dirt on Charles Swan’s sordid past. Is he really the type of father-in-law the Cullen’s are looking to welcome into their family?As we all know the Cullen’s are known for the charity work and for Dr. Cullen’s extensive contributions to the medical community, you would think bringing a well respected Sheriff into the bosom of the family as the newest in-laws would be a welcome addition over the hippies, who attend the Cullen’s family events in formal wear created from hemp, that their eldest son Jasper brought home with him when he married his wife Alice.

A spotlight from the 6/12 WC with wmr1601 ~ an outtake from lizmondaine's Seattle's Most


Posted by Shel on 6/13/2011 04:54:00 PM



Here’s a spotlight on one of the authors who participated in the 6/9 WC hosted by wmr1601.
The Adventures of Eds and Ro, an outtake from lizmondaine's story,  Seattle's Most:


 “So what do I owe the honor of seeing you outside of a charity event?” I ask finally once our waitress clears out after getting out drink orders and shoving her overly enhanced person in my face one too many times for my patience. Rose smirks and raises an eyebrow as she reclines. Without glancing under the table I’m sure she’s swinging her heel on her toe enticingly. It always amazes me to look at the pictures of us as kids, because it was as if one day Rose suddenly woke up one morning and decided she was done being a tomboy.  There was no gradual progression one day she was scarfing nachos with me and wearing her dirty jeans and Nike t-shirt two sizes too big and the next day she came into class in a sundress with lip gloss and her hair perfectly pressed.I would have been lying if I didn’t admit that I had been shaking in my Doc Martens that day, I thought I had lost my best friend. Who am I trying to kid all these years later? My only friend. However, she was the same Rose on the inside though, as soon as class ended she was at my desk rambling on and on about whatever irritation Leah had caused her. When I mention her new look and the possibility  if something had triggered it. I was rewarded with a heeled sandal upside my head and it was never discussed like that. Everyone stopped calling her amazon behind her back and instead were whispering about how hot she was. Surprisingly, people who would never look at me twice were stopping me in the hall asking if they could sit our table at the next meal. Apparently, put Rose into some fitted clothes to show off the fact that she really is a girl and suddenly everyone wanted her.

A spotlight from the 6/9 WC with Jenndur ~ TG81’s Soul to Keep


Posted by jenn on 6/10/2011 08:55:00 PM



Here’s a spotlight on one of the authors who participated in the 6/9 WC hosted by Jenndur.A teaser from Chapter 4 of TG81's story, Soul to Keep:Just as I resolve to do whatever it takes to make this change permanent, a waiter appears, offering me a canapé. I decline, but there is something about him that makes me stop. His eyes are the same French’s mustard as Andy Taylor’s and I can’t help but wonder if they are the same person. Considering all the talk of the past few days, I know there is something supernatural at work and I couldn’t care less. I’m living on cloud nine.“Miss, is everything to your liking?” the server asks.“Absolutely.” I can’t help but grin a silly smile.“Wonderful, enjoy your evening.” He winks and the way he says it makes me realize that he is the same person from before. Dream or not, this is fucking confusing. Maybe it will all make more sense in the light of day. I sigh to myself and make it to the ladies’ room in peace.After making sure my make-up was flawless, although I don’t remember putting any in my clutch, I make my way back to the party. I accidentally brush against someone and I hear them yell, “Shit!”I turn around to apologize, but words fail me when I realize I knocked a glass of red wine down the front of Edward Cullen’s tux. Apparently all the beauty and elegance that Jasper and Alice gave me, still didn’t stop me from making an ass out of myself.My words find me and I rush to apologize. The yellow-eyed waiter appears with plenty of napkins. “Thanks,” Edward mutters, not bothering to look up. I glance back at the man and he winks again, nodding for me to go back to Edward. The waiter briefly looks at my ass, and then moves along. I get a good look at Edward and he’s even better looking in person than on the front of USA Today. His tux jacket is cut for his broad shoulders and his pants are tailored perfectly for lean legs. Through all the material, I can tell, homeboy hits the gym.

A spotlight from the 6/4 WC with wmr1601 ~ shpwhitney's upcoming story, Turn My Life Around


Posted by Shel on 6/05/2011 06:04:00 PM



Here's a spotlight on one of the authors who participated in the 6/4 WC hosted by wmr1601.
A teaser from shpwhitney's upcoming story, Turn My Life Around :


As I switched my focus from the stage area to the bar, it was clear that Bella had done some changing of her own. Whereas yesterday she was wearing a pair of denim shorts, black Chuck Taylors, and the staff tee shirt, she now sported a slinky black dress that was somewhat low cut in the front and fell right above her knees. Her hair, which had been pulled back by a headband last time I saw her, was now hanging loose around her face in soft waves and accentuated the smoky makeup she wore. If I thought she was beautiful before, she was beyond stunning now.

As I walked towards the bar where she was standing off to the side, she looked up at me and smiled slightly. Once I reached her, I noticed that she looked a little flushed and anxious.

Although I wanted to know what was wrong, I wasn’t sure it was my place to ask considering we barely knew one another. Before I could make a decision, she started to speak.

“Hey, Edward. It’s nice to see you again, but you’re here early! You know the show doesn’t start until 8, and you don’t have to go on until 9, right?” she stated while looking down at what appeared to be a list of numbers in front of her.

“Yeah, I know, but I figured I’d come on by and hang out instead of letting the nerves settle in by sitting alone in my apartment waiting for time to pass,” I admitted somewhat sheepishly. Although I was still feeling the same amount of excitement that I felt while at work, the nerves and doubts were definitely setting in as well.

Something in my tone or my face must’ve tipped Bella off to my thoughts, because she looked up at me with a sweet smile and said, “Edward, you’re going to do great. You were amazing on the tape you sent in and you were amazing in person for your audition; there’s no reason to be nervous. Besides, aren’t you just suppose to imagine everyone in the audience is naked?” she finished with a little giggle.

I laughed along with her, all the while trying not to let my mind wander to what a naked Bella would look like. That would present problems I did not need before I had to sit down on a tiny stool on a stage.

“Well I don’ think I’m quite that nervous! Nothing a little liquid courage can’t cure,” I said while winking at her and motioning to the bottle of Jack that sat behind her. She winked back as she turned to grab the bottle before pouring one shot. Before she could replace the bottle, I stilled her hand.

“Whoa, whoa. You’re not going to let me drink alone, are you? I’ve heard that’s bad luck, especially right before a performance.” I said cheekily. I’m sure she knew I was full of sh*t, and I myself was surprised with how bold I had been with her in these last few minutes. It seems that when it comes to Bella, her presence brought about courage all on its own.

She laughed while shaking her head, and prepared to pour a shot for herself as well. “What the hell? With the night I’m having, maybe a drink we’ll do me some good!” Bella said as she passed me my shot and picked up hers.

A spotlight from the 6/4 WC ~ Le Crepuscule's Fandom4SAA story, Rainbow Stutters


Posted by Shel on 6/05/2011 10:00:00 AM



Here's a spotlight on one of the authors who participated in the 6/4 WC hosted by KitsuShel.
A snippet from Le Crepuscule's Rainbow Stutters, which will be featured in the Fandom 4 Sexual Assault Awareness compilation.  


“I think you're being stupid, to be honest.” Always honest, that's my sister.

“Es, be nice. The boy doesn't deserve to be called names.” And that's my soon-to-be brother-in-law, Carlisle. Did I mention he's seventeen years older then her? Yeah, apparently that means he can call me 'boy'. “Listen it's rather straight forward. You knock on her door, tell her you have a package with her name on it-.”

“What is he a pimp? Don't listen to him, he's a pervert,” glad we both realize that Sis, “look this girl is obviously a bit shy. Just go up to her when you see her and say that it was delivered to the wrong door. She'll be grateful, and right before she walks away you ask her to have coffee with you. It's all very simple, really. You're making it into this big thing when it really doesn't need to be.”

Simple adj \sim-pəl\ : Constituting a basic element : Fundamental

In kindergarten I was constantly being told to go make friends, it was simple. All I had to do was walk up and ask if one of the other kids wanted to play; I didn't. I sat underneath the large tree and watched the other children play, not because I was lazy and didn't want to, but because I liked to do it.

When I was eight years old I used to cry about not wanting to grow up and pay bills and how scary the whole concept was. I was told that it was a long ways away, simple as that.

In the seventh grade my Physical Ed teacher was trying to teach me how to throw the football so it had the spiral effect. I couldn't get it perfect, but was told that it was simple, and I wasn't listening. Every time I went to throw it with the spiral it would just sort of go to the left and flop around when no one would catch it.

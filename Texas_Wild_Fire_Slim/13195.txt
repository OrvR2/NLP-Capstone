Firefighters in Bastrop, Texas, near Austin, are working to control a wildfire that has claimed lives and burned hundreds of homes.
With lighter winds in the area, officials reported that the Bastrop blaze was 30 percent contained by early Wednesday, according to the Associated Press.
In the video below from the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department, you can see just how fast a wildfire spreads through dry brush on the north edge of Bastrop State Park. According to The Atlantic wire, the spreading fire spread across an entire field in under a minute.
Firefighters in Bastrop are receiving help from the elite Texas Task Force 1 which also helped with searches after the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina.
The state is currently in the midst of a nearly year-long dry spell that is the worst since the record drought of the 1950's.
Texas Governor Rick Perry toured burned areas near Bastrop earlier this week, saying, "The magnitude of these losses are pretty stunning," reports AP. Perry left a presidential campaign trip to South Carolina early to return to Texas and address the wildfires.
Scroll down after the video for pictures of the wildfire devastation.



Below are photos of the Bastrop, Texas wildfire destruction.

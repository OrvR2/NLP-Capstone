The cooler temperatures that have descended on Central Texas are a welcome respite, but they have produced an unhealthy atmosphere when mixed with wildfire smoke.The problem is a thermal inversion, which occurs when cooler air closer to the ground is trapped by warmer air above, preventing pollutants — such as tiny particles from smoke — from rising and being dispersed.People at the greatest risk of health problems from inhaling the tiny particles are those with respiratory conditions, such as asthma, emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Austin-area doctors said.Others at risk include people with heart disease, those who are elderly and children, but inhaled smoke "can bother anyone," said Dr. William Howland,  an Austin allergy and asthma specialist.Smoke can cause teary eyes, wheezing, coughing and difficulty with breathing.Dr. Paul Vigo,  also an Austin allergy and asthma specialist, said his office had seen five new patients by early afternoon Tuesday. "We think it's smoke-related," he said."The inversion acts like a lid," said Bob Rose,  a meteorologist with the Lower Colorado River Authority. "In this case, we don't have much wind overnight, so it will build up and stagnate and spread in all directions. It becomes very unhealthy to breathe."Rose said an inversion occurred overnight Monday and could happen again in the next couple of days. He said people with respiratory conditions should stay indoors with air conditioners running, especially from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m., when inversion conditions are most likely.Also, anyone near smoke should stay indoors.Dr. John David Hinze,  a pulmonary critical care specialist who works in St. David's HealthCare hospitals, said he has seen some increase in patient calls and visits, but not a huge amount.The ordinary healthy person should be fine outdoors unless smoke is nearby, Hinze said.Seton Healthcare Family hospitals have not seen an increase in adults with respiratory complaints, a spokeswoman said.But Dell Children's Medical Center has seen more children with those ailments in the past three days, said Dr. Pat Crocker,  chief of emergency medicine. It's difficult to say how many are smoke-related and how many are caused by a virus or another irritant, he said.Dr. Jody Henson,  an emergency medicine doctor at Scott & White Hospital-Round Rock, said Tuesday afternoon that she had seen at least two children who had been seriously affected by smoke, including one she hospitalized.If parents can smell smoke, they should limit their child's outdoor play time, she said.The doctors said that in most cases, patients with asthma and other conditions don't need a doctor unless their symptoms worsen or they have trouble breathing.Short-term exposure to smoke won't produce long-lasting health effects, they said.

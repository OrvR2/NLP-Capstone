Comings and goings: Arms controlBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Thu, Aug 18, 2011

Moves afoot in the Obama White House arms control shop: National Security Council non-proliferation hand Rexon Ryu has begun work as the deputy to the U.S. representative to the United Nations, heading up the US/UN's Washington office. Ryu, a former staffer to former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), met with Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides about his new appointment last month, according to Nides' public schedule. Ryu succeeds Erica Barks-Ruggles, who is off to South Africa to serve as the consul general of the U.S. consulate in Cape Town.
Succeeding Ryu as an NSC director for non-proliferation: the State Department's Jofi Joseph. Joseph, currently senior adviser to Under Secretary of State for Arms Control Ellen Tauscher, previously served as a non-proliferation expert on the staff of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee and for Sen. Robert Casey (D-Penn.). At the NSC, Joseph's portfolio will focus on Iran and North Korea, reporting to White House WMD czar Gary Samore.
Also joining Samore's shop: Lynn Rusten, a former Senate Armed Services Committee staffer who recently played a key role at State in the negotiations on the New START Treaty under Assistant Secretary Rose Gottemoeller. Rusten succeeds Anita Friedt, who has returned to the State Department.

@Ben Ben, your the disgrace. Your brief comment is like the article, lacking anything that should prompt negative attitude toward the president. Why don't you try to make better sense by using the tools taught in school, like properly formed sentences with purpose and clarity!

Usually i like Ben's input even though at times, he can overdo his "shtick" and snarky commentary.
But i just think he was insufferable this episode. Here are some tips:
1.) Stop interrupting﻿ people mid-sentence.
2.) Stop rehashing a joke you've made so much. Going back to it once is fine once in a while, but stop trying to flog a dead horse endlessly and for every one you make.
3.) Don't be a dick. Ana was a little tongue-tied, it happens. No need to put her on the spot like that.

@ruddypoo86 I﻿ think you're just a bitter man. I saw your comment before I watched this video and was waiting for Ben to act as a dickhead, but he didn't. He poked fun and Ana being tongue-tied once or twice which is something Ben often does anyway. He's just being himself here..

There is hope! Dead people are being canvassed and are breaking solidly for the Democrats. Do﻿ your part. Visit your local cemeteries and get out the vote; take lots of absentee ballots with you.

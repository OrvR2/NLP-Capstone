‘Venomous’ Nadal angry about rain, lashes out at U.S. Open referee By      Chris Chase


Rafael Nadal was among a number of players upset about being forced to take the court in misty conditions Wednesday at the U.S. Open. The defending tournament champion made his stance known by waiting nearly 10 minutes to emerge from the locker room. He later lashed out at tournament referee Brian Early after another band of rain delayed play after 15 minutes on the court.
"It's the same old story," Nadal said to Early of the decision to play in the light rain. "All you think about is money."
ESPN's Pam Shriver said Nadal appeared "venomous" after going down 0-3 to Gilles Muller before the rain delay. Their match had been postponed from Tuesday and was delayed an hour on Wednesday because of inclement weather.
In Nadal's mind, it never should have started.
He first expressed his anger with the passive-aggressive waiting game before the match. While Muller waited by the doors to walk out into Arthur Ashe Stadium, Nadal lingered in the locker room for eight minutes before joining him. He was asked about it by ESPN's Tom Rinaldi in the pre-match interview and unconvincingly blamed it on a miscommunication with the ATP:
"Sorry for that. It was a little bit of my fault but more fault from the ATP because they don't have to put to Gilles on court if I'm not ready. With the rain delays you never know when you have to go on court. I have to do all the tapes, I cannot do the tapes [30 minutes] before the match. I have to do it at the last moment and I have to know exactly when I have to go to the court. They told me that at the last minute. I thought we would go on later. What cannot happen is Gilles waiting for me. So sorry for that, sorry for Gilles, sorry for everybody."
It was a fine response even if it rang a little hollow. ESPN had been telling viewers that play was set to begin around noon ET for the previous hour. If Chris Fowler knew when Nadal was supposed to take the court, surely Nadal did too.
His later actions suggest the same. Nadal was clearly displeased during warm-ups and at the start of the match. Dispirited, he was broken in his first service game and was down 0-3 when the rain halted play. Nadal briefly exchanged words with Early and stormed off the court.
As of 1:30 p.m. ET, rain continued to fall in New York with little sign of stopping in the near future.

0 users disliked this comment DNY 2 minutes ago Report Abuse This situation with the weather reminds me a lot of 2009.   The rain delayed everything -- the women's semi was played late Saturday night instead of Friday afternoon, their final on Sunday, and the men's quarters and semis were all a day off and their final was played on Monday.   Neither Federer nor Serena were able to defend their titles as Clijsters and Del Potro replaced them as USO champions.   Right now it's pouring and we even hear some thunder in the distance.   Great weather for sleeping in.   Hopefully we'll get some good weather for tennis tomorrow.

0 users disliked this comment Honey 7 minutes ago Report Abuse Pam Shriver should chose her words a lot more carefully.   Describing Rafa as being venemous is ridiculous!   Upset, angry, sure---but venemous?   That's like saying he's evil and mean.   Of course Chris latched onto this word for effect no doubt.   Don't paint this image of Rafa---it's soooo not what he's about.

0 users disliked this comment Lachhman 10 minutes ago Report Abuse Idon't think the use of the word 'venomous' is proper about what Nadal said in regard to the decision to 
start the match. Nadal is not in the best of health and he has naturally to make himself ready for the 
match he has to play and plays. I watched on TV what was happening off and on the court. Both the 
players came on to the court, warmed up a bit and then had to go back. It was not a wise decision to 
start the match when there was mist in the atmosphere. Nadal seems to have lost his concentration
and as a result lost his servs when the match was interrupted again by rain. Nadal is now at a disadvant-
age psychologically as 0-3 in the first is not a good beginning for a champion who is out to retain the title
he won last year. The same thing happened about the night match which featured Serena. Both Serena 
and her opponent player had come on to the court and warmed up in their normal dress. Then there 
were confabulations between the match referee and the chair umpire who had come down to feel the 
atmospheric conditions. Then the decision to call off the match was taken and both the ladies went back.
I know the tournament committee is placed in a piquant position as a day had already been lost and another day was also going to be lost. But players' interests must also be taken into consideration. Things 
should not be hurried through when the tournament has reached a crucial stage. Now it seems there is no
escape from extending the tournament being extended. I feel an announcement about it should be made
in time so as to put the players in proper frame of mind and the bitterness as felt by Nadal is avoided.

I caught a foul ball once along the third base side that had been hit by Chipper Jones. I was with my gf at the time, now wife, and we gave it to a four year old boy sitting in front of us with his mother and father. He didn't whine or complain when I caught it and he didnt beg for it either. He was so gracious that we had given him the ball that my gf/wife went and bought him a Cardinals hat from the souvenir shop. One of my top two favorite baseball memories.

0 users disliked this comment yahoo user 28 minutes ago Report Abuse Poor choice of words for Pam Shriver. I was at the Open today and Nadal was right to indicate the match should never have started. It never stopped raining and it was clear the conditions were not dry enough for the players. He merely expressed his frustration to the officials. Afterwards several of the players met with the officials to voice the same concerns. Once again Chris Chase gets it wrong. When will Yahoo get some legitimate reporting.

0 users disliked this comment score 33 minutes ago Report Abuse Rafael Nadal is always courteous especially to the press an others who interview him.   He stood up for his rights for not playing on a wet surface and is described a "venemous".   That is ridiculous and I think that Pam Shriver is wrong in using that word to describe his statements.   I have always thought she was annoying anyway.   She is one commentator we could do without when it comes to tennis.

I think it would behoove the players, the tournament and the fans to resume the tournament into another week and that the USTA   considers a covered court in the future, not only for rainy conditions but when conditions are unbearably hot.

I have heard everything about these ladies over the years.   Continue to live your lives like you want to and don't worry about all these naysayers.   You revolutionized the game and I look forward to your induction in the Tennis Hall of Fame.

0 users disliked this comment Jay 46 minutes ago Report Abuse I would like to invite some of the commentators on ESPN., CBS and the Tennis Channel as well as some of the bloggers   to elevate the analysis of the tennis players and their games.   It really amazes me that some of these people who never won a title or were minor in the scheme of things have so much to say about what these players should be saying, wearing or doing.   The ramblings about Nadal were petty and rude.   The man has earned respect for his outstanding career and work ethic.   So has Roger Federer .   I am so tired of hearing about them getting old or losing confidence.   Well gentlemen, welcome to the club that criticizes Venus and Serena Williams and makes excuses for C.Wosniaki for mocking Nadal.    Perhaps its time for a new crew to give us a more balance perspective of players and their careers.   I think Roddick had it right the other day.

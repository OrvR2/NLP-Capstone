 Texas Forest Service in cooperation with the Southern Research Station of the USDA Forest Service conducts a forest inventory to measure the status of all the forest resources in the state. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program consists of a series of permanently established plots which are re-measured every five to 10 years to determine growth, composition and mortality of forests, as well as land use changes and potential for wildfire in the state. Previous surveys were conducted periodically in East Texas during 1935, 1955, 1965, 1975, 1985 and 1992.Issues such as increased demands for forest products, restricted timber supplies from regions such as the Pacific Northwest and growing interest in forested conditions other than commercial timberland have increased need for FIA data. The 1998 Farm Bill replaced the periodic surveys of the past with a continuous survey system where 10-20% of the plots are measured annually and increased the scope of the survey from only commercial timberland to all woodlands of the stateIn June of 2003, the first complete round of this new annual survey system was completed in East Texas and in August of 2008, the second complete round was completed. Twenty percent (20%) of the plots are measured annually with latest inventory data available for 2010. In January of 2004, the survey of the 211 counties not included in the original 43 East Texas counties was begun and results based on the first 17,000 plots measured are currently available.FIA provides objective and scientifically credible information, and is part of the universal benchmark for measuring the sustainability and success of natural resource and land management practices. The results of this research will help landowners make informed decisions about managing their land for desired outcomes, whether it is to run cattle, attract wildlife or harvest trees for income. Data is reported on a county, regional and statewide basis, ensuring the confidentiality of individual landowner information. FIA teams will not access private land without the landowner's permission.East Texas InventoryCentral and West Texas InventoryFor additional information, please contact Christopher C.

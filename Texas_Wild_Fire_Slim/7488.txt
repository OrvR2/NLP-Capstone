JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) — Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony may be ending their personal relationship, but their professional one lives on.Anthony and Lopez launched their fashion lines — the Marc Anthony Collection and the Jennifer Lopez Collection — on Wednesday.Anthony marked the launch with a ribbon cutting at Kohl's department store in downtown Jersey City, N.J. Lopez did not attend, but Anthony said they collaborated a lot on the work."I always had Jennifer as a soundboard and vice versa," he said of his collection. "I'm really happy about her line and I saw all the work that she put into it."Anthony also said he's "really proud of" Lopez.The pair, both 42, announced their split in July after seven years of marriage. They have 3-year-old twins named Max and Emme.In April, Lopez and Anthony announced plans for a TV show together called "Q'Viva! The Chosen," a series searching for talent in Latin America and then bringing them to America. It will be produced by Simon Fuller, the creator of "American Idol," where Lopez works as judge. A representative for Anthony said the show is in its pre-production stage.___Online:http://kohlsjlmafallcollections.com/___Mesfin Fekadu covers entertainment for The Associated Press.

I agree, they both suck. They use fur. They could change the world and the way people treat animals, instead, they abuse them, and the fur trade continues. Celebrities like them, could have a great legacy. But no, greed...

There will be people across the country who buy their clothing lines. The same way they bought J-Lo's fragrance a few years back. It's all about "your brand" these days. For everyone who's bashing these two in Yahoo's Comments and around the internet, there's someone saying, 'I'm gonna check this out...see what all the fuss is about'. Good or bad it's just Capitalism...and that kiddies is the American Way...

Marc Anthony: Is he a pimp or just a wimp? The talentless fairy is as fake as his name. He and Lopez are truly the queens of shoddy clothes and greasy cosmetics. Well, at least it helps to keep them away from microphones; I guess that's a bonus.

I don't know why celebrities think we will buy something just because it has their name on it. How vain is that?!  And I don't know why retailers and companies want to pay celebrities millions of dollars for them to represent their line. We'd rather prefer to use a normal person, and make the items cheaper. We're not stupid enough to think that we're going to buy this-and-that because of so-and-so on the ad. And we're definitely not stupid enough to think that these people shop in the exact stores that their own "collections" are sold. How many of these celebrities are getting their outfits at Kohl's, Target and KMart??? Pu-leezzz!  What a waste of money and an insult to our intelligence!

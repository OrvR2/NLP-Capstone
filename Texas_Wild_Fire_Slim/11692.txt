HAVESTING METHODS









[ Print |

There are different methods to harvest timber for specific management goals and you need to make sure that the method you are employing is appropriate for your management objectives.  Many times landowners simply sell timber with little to no thought of what potential the stand will have in the future.  Every operation should be well organized in your management plan and should focus on continually improving the overall composition, production and health of the forest. 
With this in mind it is important to note that there are several harvesting alternatives available related to removal of trees from your property.  The professional forester you work with can recommend total or thinning harvesting alternatives depending on the condition of each specific stand of timber.  These options vary on application, intensity and ultimate goal for the harvest.  These different alternatives can lead to natural regeneration of the site using the existing trees to naturally seed in the site with a new forest or in the case of total harvesting can open up the site to be ready to be planted with genetically improved seedlings.  Both of these types of harvest mimic natural processes by removing trees to promote growth, enhance wildlife habitat and cover, encourage regeneration, enhance forest health and perpetuation of the forest.  Thinning harvests can be planned on a cycle to allow regular income from a stand of trees while total harvests are a one time operation and will necessitate reforestation operations to replace the forest. 
These different harvests types can:
• Salvage anticipated losses of merchantable volume due to natural mortality
• Increase value from improved diameter growth of your residual trees
• Provide income and control of growing stock during the stands rotation
• Improve product quality of your forest
• Provide opportunities to improve stand composition, reduce risk of damage, promote wildlife and prepare for establishment of new trees

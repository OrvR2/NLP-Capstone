BASTROP, Texas (AP) - Fire crews are gaining ground against one of the most destructive wildfires in Texas history.
Firefighters report that the flames are at least 30 percent contained after burning uncontrolled for three days. They credit an easing of the winds from Tropical Storm Lee that had caused thefire to explode over the weekend.
The blaze has left at least two people dead, blackened about 45 square miles around Bastrop and cast a haze over Austin, 25 miles to the west.
The state reports the number of homes lost has reached almost 800. An elite team is searching the smoking ruins to see if there are more victims.
The wildfire is the most catastrophic of more than 170 blazes that have erupted in the past week across the Lone Star State, which is perilously dry because of one of the state's most severedroughts on record. In addition to the two victims in the Bastrop area fire whose bodies were found Tuesday, the outbreak is blamed for two deaths elsewhere.

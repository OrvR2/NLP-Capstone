“I wouldn’t like to see Americans make the same mistake Canadians have made… Patients in Canada are treated like Third World citizens. Our health-care system is like Cuba or North Korea.”
- Lindsay McCreith (Brain tumor patient, Canada)

Gisela Stuart, MP for Edgbaston in Birmingham, West Midlands, a former parliamentary under-secretary of state for health, called the inquiry findings `tragic’ and said she had requested a Government debate on maternity services.
NOW lets focus on all the short comings﻿ of the Europe NHS and all the recorded ways in which it eats peoples live and their income and how it is on edge of collapse now that we cant fund their little fantasy land system and now THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR IT hehehehe

‘It is not something that we should underestimate in terms of an emotional response﻿ to it, and it is something we must improve upon.

hate the unborn. Hate themselves and hate not﻿ only god but the very idea of order and regulation from god.
Fay Baillie, from NHS West Midlands, said: ‘The report is really disappointing. It has identified that there have been babies that have died in the West Midlands for whom we as health professionals could have provided better treatment.

But﻿ Mrs Scott added: ‘From the perspective of parents this is unforgivable as every parent needs to know that their baby’s death has been investigated with the utmost rigour, and that when something has gone wrong changes are made in hospital systems to ensure it cannot happen again. ‘Depressingly, the same poor levels of care have been identified in previous national reports over the last 10 years. Why aren’t lessons being learned and babies’ lives being saved?’

@footstomp1﻿ Where the fuck do you get your information dude? Most countries have a top tax bracket of 30 something percent.
(In the 20's they fixed the US economy by making the rich pay something like 95% income tax)

@footstomp1 Sigh, Americans. Look at any country in Europe for healthcare, look at Australia. There has NEVER been 'death panels' or other alarmist bullshit, our systems just work.
Anecdotal evidence probably copy pasted off of bill o reillys website or some shit proves nothing.
Nobody dies because their public health care rejected them for not being sick enough, or gave them shitty cheap treatment. Plenty die in the US because﻿ they cant afford any at all though.

people how in NHS﻿ countries that they tax 60 to 78% of your meager incomes is why that is...or does that cold hard light of truth make it less attractive? mmm? mmm?

The panel also found mothers who lost babies were offered ‘substandard’ support and bereavement care in seven of the cases. Before the inquiry, which was carried out by the West Midlands Perinatal Institute,﻿ the hospitals involved had only identified a quarter of the significant failings in the cases. NHS West Midlands, which deals with 70,000 deliveries per year, said it would learn lessons from the inquiry.
Whats the life of a few kids huh? And as for free doctor visit bill why not tell

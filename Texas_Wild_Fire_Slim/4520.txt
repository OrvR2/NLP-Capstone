Video: Coastal Carolina coach demands a locker room full of dogs By      Matt Hinton


Here's longtime Coastal Carolina head coach and reigning Big South Conference Coach of the Year David Bennett earlier this week, speaking in the form of a parable to communicate to reporters the mindset of the Chanticleers ahead of Saturday's showdown with Bennett's former team, Division II Catawba College. What that mindset is, I have no idea.
 
The complete transcript is as follows:
Tryin' to get our two boys ready to carry 'em to the golf tournament before practice, right? Twelve cats live across the road. Our door's open. Screen's broke — we need to get a new screen door — but the screen's broke, so you can come in through the screen but you can't get back out of it. I turn and look. There's a little kitty cat in our—in our kitchen.
So I said, "What're you doin' in here, little kitty cat?" By that time, [growl], the cat turns, tries to get back out, but the screen won't go that way. Cat starts goin' "MEEOOOOW!" All crazy! And I told our players: We need more dogs. Bo's barkin' in the back, I have to go shut Bo up, Mel's like, "What's goin' on?!" I say, "There's a cat in the house." "Cat in the house?!" I said, "Yeah, there's a cat in the house!"
So I told our players, I tried to let it out the front door—"MEEEOOOW!"—the cat's still goin' crazy in there. And I told our players: You need to be more like a dog! We don't need a bunch of cats in here—meow!—lookin' in the mirror. "I look gooood, I got my extra bands on, I got my other shoes." Be a dog! We don't need no meows, we don't need no cats. We need more dawgs.
I still have no idea what that means. But I do know Knute Rockne couldn't have said it better himself.

No comments






Photo by Maise 
One construction was trapped in a pile of bricks and critically injured when building under construction in Brooklyn came crashing down.  Three other people, including 2 workers and a passerby who tried to help, sustained non-life threatening injuries.
FDNY sent a major collapse assignment and was able to free the man trapped victim in about 20 minutes. City engineers believe a critical support may have been removed, causing the collapse. See the video below, it has some good shots of the collapse scene.

You’ve heard of a chinese fire drill, check out a chinese confined space rescue
No comments






Sky News Photo
Sky News reported the confined space rescue went something like this:
“The first rescue attempt involved hoisting the thinnest member of the group down the pipe to try to attach a harness around him. But the boy was too far down to reach and the rescuer could not get his shoulders into the narrow pipe.”
 
 


“A group of firemen then lowered a makeshift harness down and encouraged the boy to grab it, and eventually hauled him out. The boy emerged shocked but otherwise uninjured.”

Here’s the the video, sorry no subtitles available…

Honolulu Fire Boat Faces Sinking Budget
1 comment






Special Operations Units are some of the most expensive fire department assets to maintain, and often have a much lower run volume.  As budgets across the country get tighter, special operations teams are facing dramatic cuts or even being eliminated all together.
The Honolulu Fire Department staffs a 110′ fire boat owned by the state.   The state gives HFD $2,000,000 for maintenance and a six person crew 24×7.  The State would like to find a less expensive arrangement, possibly reducing the staffing to 2 members 24×7.

Multiple Departments Fight Fire at Ohio Nuclear Power Plant
No comments






Photo by Jamie Andea / AP
Firefighters from Painesville, Perry, and Madison were called to the Perry Nuclear Power Plant outside Cleveland. They assisted the plants fire brigade with fighting a fire described as small, but stubborn.  Two members of the fire brigade were transported for heat exhaustion.
Initial reports are that the fire involved a lubricant for a pump motor, and may have spread to insulation soaked with the lubricant.  The fire re-ignited several times, but was finally contained after about 3 hours.
Plant personnel reduced power output to 70%, but said there was never any danger to the public.

Search & Rescue Team Hoists Stranded Dog up Cliff.
No comments







The Mineral County, Colorado Sheriff’s Department Search & Rescue Team pulled a dog to safety after it fell/slid several hundred feet down a cliff.  A passerby heard the dog barking and called the Sheriff.  The Search & Rescue team lowered a rescuer down the cliff and attached a harness to the dog.  Both were then hoisted up the cliff.
Mineral County has a pollution of 831 people.  I highly doubt the rescue team performed this rescue for the “public relations”.   So why did they do it then ? Maybe they did it for the old fashion reason…because it was the right thing to do.
Two thumbs up for MCSD SAR team.

Another Chemical Suicide…This time in a house.
No comments






Photo by Gavin Lesnick
A property manager discovered the body while checking on the renter who had not be seen in awhile.  A note was found nearby indicating a hazmat team was needed.
The North Little Rock Arkansas Fire Department Hazmat Team responded.  The team removed a bucket of chemicals that had been mixed together in an apparent suicide attempt.
Although most chemical suicides occur in cars, responders should be on guard for a possible chemical suicide on all EMS, runs including man down or welfare check type calls.
In many instances, but not all, the victim has left a warning note for responders.  Although responders should always look for the presence of a note, don’t bet you life on the kindness of stranger.   Stay alert, and when in doubt, don your bunker gear and SCBA.

Nighttime Helo Operations in San Diego Cliff Rescue
No comments







San Diego fire and lifeguards responded when a man took a tumble down a cliff.   The rocky terrain made moving the patient difficult, so rescuers elected to hoist onboard Copter 2, hovering overhead.   Try not to get hypnotized (like I did) by the light up rescue hook and the cool blinky thing on rescue tech that was lowered by the helo.

The Friendship Hose Company responded to a water rescue, when a vehicle drove around barricades and became partially submerged in the flooded roadway.  The 1994 Nissian Pathfinder was occupied by three adults and an infant in a car seat.  A bystander walked out to the SUV and retrieved in the child.
The adults, including the child’s dad who was the driver, elected to wait for  rescue.  Rescuers were able to pick the stranded occupants up in a boat, and walk it to shore.  The driver of the SUV was charged with disorderly conduct.

Hazmat called for mystery illness on plane.  Exhaust fumes suspected
1 comment






Photo by WSOCTV.com 
A hazmat team along with EMS were called to the Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, when 9 people, including 2 pilots, began filling ill onboard a US airways flight.  The 767 had just pushed back from the gate when passengers and crew began coughing and complaining of burning eyes.
Hazmat members entered the plane with meters and checked the entire aircraft, but didn’t detect any hazardous chemicals.  The FAA says that faulty seals on two of the plane’s doors may have allowed exhaust fumes to seep into the cabin.
Apparently, this same plane has had odor issues on three previous occasions.  Read the full story here.

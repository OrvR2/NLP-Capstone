Letter from Lincoln being sold by Philly dealerBy JOANN LOVIGLIO - Associated Press | AP – 7 hrs ago

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A rare letter is for sale that President Abraham Lincoln wrote to one of his top generals at a turning point of the Civil War. The Raab Collection in Philadelphia is selling the document, which for decades has belonged to an anonymous private collector. The asking price is $100,000.Lincoln wrote the letter to Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan on Oct. 29, 1862, requesting a progress report. The handwritten note on presidential stationery with "Executive Mansion" printed at the top, states that Lincoln was pleased with the movement of McClellan's Army of the Potomac as it crossed the Potomac River into Loudoun County, Va., and he was closely following its advancement.The president's battlefield dispatch to McClellan ends: "When you get entirely across the river let me know. What do you know of the enemy?" The letter is signed A. Lincoln.Though the apparently hastily scrawled note belies Lincoln's dissatisfaction with McClellan's performance, it is the president's final correspondence to the general before relieving him of his command for failing to aggressively pursue Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee since the Battle of Antietam a month earlier."This was the last straw for Lincoln, who now came into his own," said Nathan Raab, vice president of The Raab Collection. "He realized that his strategic sense was better than that of his military experts and that he must exert leadership in military matters rather than defer to his generals."Lincoln's demotion of McClellan on Nov. 5, 1862, was the first of a series of decisions that culminated with the president naming Ulysses S. Grant as his commanding general, a move that ultimately ended the war and brought victory to the North in April 1865. Lincoln was assassinated days afterward.Four years later, Grant became the 18th president of the United States.___Online:Letter details: http://bit.ly/oFzE6t

A letter from Lincoln -- He placed it in a time capsule...
It reads "Stop robbing and cheating Americans in the name of my Party..."
"What have you done -- back in MY day, Republicans HELPED Americans, and DEMOCRATS had all the bigots!"

even though it is of presidential importance, putting it in a museum (unless it is of Lincoln Memorabilia only), doesn't mean that it will be on public view......most of the rare and important documents (there are some exclusions) are locked away in protected drawers and vaults that only chosen and selected scholars are privy to...I'm sure there are lots of them that have never been seen by ""the public""...so much for "ownership".

It's pains me to say this but....documents like this belong in a national museum for all americans to view. It's a matter of patriotism.

Bachmann Tones Down Words on HPV Dangers
Rush Limbaugh says she's 'jumping the shark' with retardation anecdote

(Newser) -
                                    Michele Bachmann looks to be pulling back from controversial comments she made about the HPV vaccine after drawing flak from the medical community and others—including Rush Limbaugh, notes  Minnesota Public Radio . Bachmann  scored points  in last night's debate by criticizing Rick Perry's decision to try to mandate...

Michele Got Her Mojo Back
Bachmann's HPV attack on Perry turned heads

(Newser) -
                                    Pundits seemed to all agree that Michele Bachmann was on the ropes heading into last night’s Tea Party debate—and now they all seem to agree that she fought her way back in with her  scathing indictment  of Rick Perry’s HPV vaccination program. Here’s what people are...

Debate Winners: Romney, Bachmann, Tea Party
Rick Perry-bashing pays off for rivals

(Newser) -
                                    It was "attack Rick Perry night" at last  night's GOP debate in Florida -—to the extent that even Jon Huntsman got in on the act—and the Texan's rivals succeeded in landing a few blows. Mitt Romney, who wisely ignored the Tea Party debate audience to...

Social security and Tea Party topics likely to be big issues

Bachmann: Obama's Plan Just 'Gimmicks'
She denounces it as a 'political speech'

(Newser) -
                                    Michele Bachmann criticized  President Obama's jobs plan  tonight as filled with "failed gimmicks" and "yet one more political speech where he doubled down on more of the same policies that are killing the United States economy," reports  Fox News . "Mr. President, what among your proposals...

'Michele Bachmann Overdrive': Not a Tribute Band
Group hopes to capitalize on her name while poking fun

(Newser) -
                                    Michele Bachmann is such an icon these days, she’s even got a band named after her—though its members aren’t her biggest fans. “The concept is to have a band that captures the spirit of Michele Bachmann by being somewhat ill-prepared, not really up to the challenge...

Bachmann Will Rebut Obama's Speech
She appears to be only Republican planning to do so

(Newser) -
                                    As she  struggles to stay relevant  in the 2012 presidential race, Michele Bachmann has figured out at least one more way to keep her name in the news. She’ll offer a rebuttal to President Obama’s jobs speech tonight at 8:30pm,  The Hill  reports. No formal Republican response...

And the Winner Is ... Mitt Romney (Mostly)
His steady performance seems to make him the consensus pick over Perry

(Newser) -
                                    A consensus is taking shape from last night's GOP debate, and Mitt Romney should be pleased. He won or at least held his own in the eyes of most (but certainly not all). Chris Cillizza of the  Washington Post  pronounces him the winner for his "slow and steady"...

Bachmann Is 'Done. Fini. Kaput.'
Critics agree: GOP debate confirmed she's just an 'afterthought' now

(Newser) -
                                    If the fat lady didn’t quite sing for Michele Bachmann at last night’s debate, she at least hummed a few notes, say the critics:   It was “remarkable” to see this once-top-tier candidate “relegated to an afterthought, getting barely as much face time as Herman Cain, Rick ...

Perry, Romney Tee Off
Texas governor makes his presidential debate debut

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry made his debate debut tonight, and it's clear the new frontrunner is happy to mix it up. He and Mitt Romney went after each other with gusto, notes  AP , as evidenced by an early exchange: After Perry criticized Romney's record of creating jobs in Massachusetts, Romney...

What to Watch for in Tonight's Debate
Will Perry make a good impression? Can Bachmann survive?

(Newser) -
                                    Sure, some of them have faced off before—but tonight’s Politico/NBC News debate marks the first time  new frontrunner Rick Perry  will join the fray, making it what  Politico  calls the “first Fall Classic” for 2012 GOP presidential hopefuls. And it’s the start of a busy month...

Bachmann's Shooting Star Is Burning Out
Bachmann's poll numbers have dropped in half since winning Ames

(Newser) -
                                    A month ago, Michele Bachmann won the Ames Straw Poll and was a leading candidate in the GOP's nomination process. Today, her support has plunged in half,  her campaign manager has quit,  and she's struggling to keep her name alive in a contest increasingly  all about Rick Perry...

Perry New Frontrunner in Post Poll
He moves ahead of Romney and steals Bachmann's support

(Newser) -
                                    New poll results from the  Washington Post  and ABC have a familiar ring—Rick Perry is the frontrunner. Among all Republicans and right-leaning independents, Perry gets 27%, followed by Mitt Romney (22%), Sarah Palin (14%), Ron Paul (8%), and Michele Bachmann. What's more, 30% say Perry has the best...

Ed Rollins said Bachmann was losing momentum before stepping down

(Newser) -
                                    Trouble in political paradise?

"I wish I was 40 years old, but I'm not," he said. "I'...

Romney seeks middle as other GOP candidates vie for right

(Newser) -
                                    With the GOP presidential candidates vying to be the rightest-of-the-right at yesterday's Freedom Forum in South Carolina, Mitt Romney kept focused on the general election, where wooing moderates is key, reports  Politico .

(Newser) -
                                    Michele Bachmann isn't giving up on her $2-a-gallon gas, today repeating her pledge to bring pump prices down, reports  Politico .

                                    He's not exactly yelling  "You lie!,"  but count Jim DeMint as less than thrilled about President Obama's jobs speech on Thursday,  Politico  reports. “I’m so tired of his speeches it’s going to be hard for me to watch,” the South Carolina Tea...

Campaign confirms she's focusing on Iowa, South Carolina

(Newser) -
                                    Where’s Michele Bachmann? Well, she’s certainly not in New Hampshire. She hasn’t visited the state since two months ago, and she canceled her last planned visit, after the Ames straw poll. In fact, every single 2012 GOP candidate other than Bachmann has been to New Hampshire since...

And that's bad news for Mitt Romney's quest for cash

(Newser) -
                                    Michele Bachmann  likes to talk to crowds  about "the creator of the universe, our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ."

(Newser) -
                                    Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry’s time in the spotlight has brought back a “fear of theocracy” not seen since the days of George W. Bush.

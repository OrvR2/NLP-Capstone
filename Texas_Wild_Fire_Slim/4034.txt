Dec. 14, 2010 — MIDLAND, Texas — Drought conditions, high winds and low humidity are prompting Texas Forest Service officials to predict a high risk for wildfire Tuesday and Wednesday in West Texas.Texas Forest Service is stationing resources throughout the state. High risk is forecast in an area including the Guadalupe Mountains, Lincoln National Forest, Southeast New Mexico Plains, Van Horn Highway 54 corridor and the Davis and Apache Mountains. The combination of ongoing drought, gusty winds and low humidity creates the potential for large and threatening wildfires. Residents in this area should use caution and refrain from outdoor burning or other activities that could start a wildfire.“Some of our most damaging fires occur in the winter,” said Texas Forest Service Fire Operations Chief Mark Stanford. “Freezing weather comes in and kills the grass. It’s dry and burns really easily.”Contact:Les Rogers, Texas Forest Service Assistant Chief Regional Fire Coordinator(325) 928-1427 Office, lrogers@tfs.tamu.edu Writer: April Saginor, Texas Forest Service Communications Specialist979-458-6619, asaginor@tfs.tamu.edu

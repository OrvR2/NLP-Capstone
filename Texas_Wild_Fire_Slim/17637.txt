Mitch,
 
I just wanted to take a second and acknowledge you and your team.  The construction industry seems to be more like a fire department in that everything seems to be a fire drill.  The ability of Agnes, Becky, and yourself to respond to our last min demands does not go unnoticed.  
 
Excellent customer service is expected, yet rarely found...  I just want you to know that I personally appreciate everyone?s efforts.   While in the heat of the moment I might not take the time to indicate as much, but I do...   
 
 
Our reply:Bill,
 
Thank you for your very positive comments regarding our Corkill Insurance team members Mitch Backes, Agnes Olech and Becky Spees.  Everyone at Corkill Insurance is dedicated to client service at the highest level and getting feedback ...

                            Review by: Randy Ferrari (Lombard, IL)
Corkill Team Member: Brian Mock  
Department: Sales  
Several years ago I was directed by the owners of L.J. Shaw to review our health insurance program.  We are a small firm and have had a strong commitment to provide the best service to our clients and loyalty to our employees since 1932.  The length of our relationships with our clients and the years of service of our staff attest to the wisdom of that commitment.
 
At the outset of my review process I received a solicitation from Brian Mock of the Corkill Insurance Agency.  It was the classic ?cold call?.  I spoke with Brian and was impressed with his congeniality and professionalism.  Shortly thereafter I asked that he review our health insurance program.  His prompt response and comprehensive presentation to the L.J. Shaw partners resulted in their ...

Corkill Team Member: Rich Moss  
Department: Sales  
The Lincolnshire-Riverwoods Fire Protection District has purchased health insurance through the Corkill Insurance Agency for the last four or five years  In 2009 we added our workers compensation insurance and in 2010 our business and liability insurance. .  The reason for our switching agencies was simple. We had developed a relationship with our agent Rich Moss and we were so confident in Rich  that we moved when he did so we could stay with him. Since  we have expanded our relationship with Corkill we have found all of their staff to be competent and trustworthy in helping us to protect our employees and assets. We still deal with Rich Moss for our health insurance and he updates on an ongoing basis throughout the year with what is ...

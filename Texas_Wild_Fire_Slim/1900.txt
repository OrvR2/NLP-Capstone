					You can find out more about me on my Google Profile: Haydn.

My work is about the personal and systemic aspects of innovation, how the new economy is emerging through personal and systemic change: this collision is helping us reshape the world. I call it Re:Thinking Innovation because that's what many of us are doing, rethinking how we create wealth, reshaping capitalism.

I look at it from the personal perspective - how we individually are changing the way we engage with wealth creation, the cultural, how change is manifesting around us, the systemic, how structures and markets are changing, and the enterprise, what's different in work. But always, I hope bringing it back to individuals and their needs.

I've written for HBR.org, The Wall St Journal, The Times, GigaOM, and The Irish Times, on economics, innovation and design. I've made TV programmes for the BBC, Channel 4 and RTE. And I've worked with many major companies like Alcatel-Lucent, Unilever, and Volvo.

The ease with which people can make use of Twitter and Facebook gives them a potentially dominant position in opinion forming. After all, it takes just a couple of key strokes to participate in the flow of outrage, interest, intrigue or humour.Yet blogs are still numerically the most important place to express opinion on significant issues.
They ease past Twitter and Facebook once the noise around an issue extends beyond one day.
What does this mean for how companies and politicians engage with people over time?
Facebook and Twitter are one day wonders on many topics.
If you look at Twitter use on any single day it normally will outshine Facebook as a source of shared news, though the difference can sometimes be marginal. And blogs are generally a poor third place not much above forums.
The chart below shows the use of Twitter and Facebook during this year’s Tsunami on 3/11/11, the peak day of news activity around the event. All data here is courtesy of Netbase who are kindly supporting this research (we’ll have more data next week and I should include the caveat that the research is preliminary and these are first impressions).

Social networks (Facebook) at 34% of buzz compared with Microblogs (Twitter) at 40% means Facebook comfortably shades Twitter. Blogs at 13% are barely in the picture.
Take a look at the chart below because it shows that when you extend the period of coverage to a month, blogs become the dominant form of participation.

Hi Haydn – enjoyed that post, interesting stuff!
I tend to think there’s an element of comparing apples and oranges in blogs v social networks though.
That’s not only in the difference between mass audience ‘broadcast style’ blogging, and friends + family ‘conversation style’ Twitter / Facebook behaviour.
Also: there’s often a discovery gap – a high proportion of the Facebook iceberg sits in a walled garden (there’s a mixed metaphor for the ages!) and isn’t discoverable by monitoring technology.
Ditto Twitter, for which the free search API only looks at 10% of all Tweets posted.
I don’t know Netbase well enough to know if that could be the reason, but it’s definitely a factor to be considered.
I think the key point about stickiness of blog v social network interest is a really powerful one though. And it leads to another really important – and not often considered point: that social media is not monolithic, and an ‘opinion’ on a blog is a very different type of beast to an ‘opinion’ on Twitter or Facebook.
That’s a point that isn’t often factored into social media monitoring programmes.

You’re right Chris – thanks for commenting and I know you are the expert on the topic. There are a number of things going on here. If you recall you and I did research on recession and recovery and found people in comments generally prefer to talk about people – Obama for example. That’s also going on in this research. Where people are using blogs is where the issue focuses on a person – Obama and Bernanke. I will come back to that tomorrow hopefully.
The point that I think stands out in the material posted to date is if you get past the first 24 hours people blogs become an increasingly significant part of the online activity. I hope to get mor ddata to share with you and please pitch in with observations.

very interesting post.
I blog, and for me blogging is the best medium to properly express my ideas. I also use Twitter , to get readers or for for immediate reactions to events, as you say.
I use other people’s Tweets to get news fast, but I click through to their blogs for the real discussions.

The truth is we HAVE to use twitter and facebook to amplify blogs, so I understand what Chris is saying – we probably don’t log all the activity ontwitter and we can’t get at everything said on facebook, but by the same token every time we blog we push messages out to twitter and facebook. they are amplifiers rather than builders of opinion

The nature of Twitter does not allow any deep level discussion of a topic.
The FB isn’t totally open, the discussion, if there’s one, is confined within the “friends” circle.
Whereas, blogger is almost totally open, if the commenting feature does not have much nonsense requirement, hence, the scope of thoughts and ideas can easily flow on such a platform.  So, it has my vote to say the least.

Thanks for commenting – you’re right of course. I’m a big fan of blogging as a new historically important phase in communications.

I enjoyed your article Haydn! I work very closely with all of our brand and agency clients and do a lot of social media research for my blog.  What I have noticed is that people express very fleeting, spur of the moment opinions/reactions on twitter and facebook – an instant response to what is going on in their world.  These comments may be passionate and when looked at in amalgam, highlight a trend or lead to an insight.  But, from my perspective, the real meaty insights can come from forums and blogs/blog comments.  I think this is because blogs and forums are gathering places that unite people and encourage passionate and in depth conversations.  So, if you want to get a “gut” reaction take on what people initially think, you find patterns in the microblog and social network domains.  When you want to dig into a topic and see what people are thinking more deeply, you will find interesting insights in blogs and forums. Regarding Chris’  question on NetBase data, we only access public facing data and go beyond what is available from the free search APIs.
Looking forward to the next post!

One of the things I’ve noticed is how people use blogs to write about people as well as issues. By the way – forums being still so strong amazed me.

From Inhabitat:
Anonymous artist group LuzInterruptus rattled the crowds at Hamburg's Dockville Festival with a haunting installation that reminds us of the dangers of nuclear power. The Spanish collective is known for creating guerilla LED light installations throughout the streets of Madrid that they call "interventions." Their work often features slightly illuminated everyday materials and figures that would otherwise go unnoticed.

				The high level nuclear wastes from power plants need to be kept safe and monitored for thousands of years, not hundreds. Until sane solutions to dealing with this stuff are found we shouldn't be creating more of it or risking releasing it into the environmen­t.

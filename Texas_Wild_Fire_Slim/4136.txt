Pauline Potter has found the ultimate motivation to go on a diet.
The 47-year-old woman from Sacramento, Calif., tells HuffPost Weird News that she has accepted the title as "World's Heaviest Woman" so that she can come to terms with the fact that she currently tips the scales at 643 pounds.
Potter's amazing story will be featured in the 2012 Guinness World Records, which will be released Sept. 15. The new book will feature a section on "Extreme Beauty."
In the past few weeks, two other large ladies -- Susanne Eman and Donna Simpson -- have been said to be vying for the heaviest woman title.

Simpson entered the Guinness book as the world's heaviest mother. She weighed in at 532 pounds when she gave birth to her daughter, Jacqueline, in 2007. A team of 30 doctors assisted in the procedure.
Eman, a native of Case Grande, Ariz., claims to weigh 728 pounds. However, she has not verified that distinction with Guinness officials.
Potter says she isn't looking to turn her fat into fame -- at least not in the long run.
"I did a lot of thinking about this," Potter told HuffPost Weird News. "I called Dr. Phil, Dr. Oz, Oprah -- and no one would help. I didn't want to call Guinness, but I thought this was the only way to get my story out so I could get help."
Potter says that obesity runs her in family. "My father was 600 pounds at one point and my mom weighed 400," she said.
Still, she does not want to blame her condition on genetics.
"I do have a sweet tooth," she said. "I love Haagen Dazs and a pint is nearly a thousand calories. But, to be honest, my son eats more than me and weighs less so I think I also have a slow metabolism."
A Guinness representative says Potter came forward not for fame, but in hopes of getting help to lose weight.
"[Potter's] reason for getting in touch with Guinness World Records was to gain public attention for her situation, in the hope that a doctor or nutritionist would see her story and want to help her lose weight," the representative said.
Potter describes herself as a single mother raising a teenage boy. Although she is currently unemployed and collecting disability and Medicare, she hopes to get well enough that she will be able to attend school and finish her nursing degree.
Although some have suggested that the inclusion of records such as "World's Heaviest Woman" encourages unhealthy behavior, the Guinness rep says the organization is simply "chronicling the extremes in the existing world around us, which include this particular human body category."
Guinness recognizes 1,200-pound Rosalie Bradford as the heaviest woman in history. She was 63 years old when she passed away in 2006.
"Our job is to be the arbiter of records," the representative said. "This is not a record we are encouraging anyone to break, however, because of the severity of her health crisis. Of course we are hopeful that her story will be heard and that she will obtain medical help she needs."
If all goes well for Potter, she will be a true one-hit wonder, as far as Guinness is concerned.
"Nothing would make me happier than to not be in the book next year," she said. "I want to dance, ride a bike. I don't want to be like the other women who are gaining weight on purpose. I am existing, not living."

				That is Nothing to smile about. Perhaps its the fame of it all.. Because I know for myself, being obese is truly horrible. There is so much discust inside of ourselves that believe it or not, for me anyway, we hate ourselves, then the thoughts of "who cares anyway" kinda thing. It really is a mental problem as well as physical problem. And for you people that  say " just join a gym!  or just go DO something about it!"  Dont have a clue what kind of life heavy people live.  We know we are fat, you dont need to keep repeating it, and maybe some of us ARE doing something about it. or maybe some of have diseases that side effects are weight gain. Obesity is NO laughing matter I agree, the USA is becoming the fattist nation on earth!  Even our children are becoming obese!  I have news for schools who want to make lunches differentl­y, and congress that thinks taxing soda's would do the trick. It aint gonna happen  We all know what the problem is but ignore it.  Take away ninetindos­, ps3's or whatever, tv's  get those kids out from"machi­nes' and outside playing real games that are much better for the mind, and wayy better for bodies. As for adults, well..you just can't have everything you want to eat so get over it!

				"Simpson entered the Guinness book as the world's heaviest mother. She weighed in at 532 pounds when she gave birth to her daughter, Jacqueline­, in 2007. A team of 30 doctors assisted in the procedure.­"

Some hard core proof that obesity is contributi­ng to the skyrocketi­ng medical fees faced by all. How much do you think it cost that hospital to have 30 doctors assist in her delivery? I severely doubt she was billed for all those doctors' time, as well.

This article talks about her "amazing story", and I all see is a woman who's happy on the couch receiving Medicare and disability­, always was happy on the couch getting paid for it, and while she may say she's doing this to get help, perhaps she can help herself. Instead of spending money on ice cream, she can just *pay* for a personal trainer or dietician to help her. You know, like people who are actually serious about losing weight do, instead of calling Dr. Phil, Dr. Oz, Oprah....

				This is really just sad, not amazing in any way.  At what weight did she think she may have a problem ... what makes you keep eating?  And I am a weight loss success story having kept off  43 lbs. since 1991 (a few slip ups here and there but mostly kept it off -- and no it isn't "easy" but it is certainly better than the alternativ­e).  This story put the fear of God in me as I have resolved every month this summer to go back to my "real" eating habits ... it is starting NOW.  Do you really think she is happy -- she has got to be bored out of her mind!  Human beings never cease to fascinate me.

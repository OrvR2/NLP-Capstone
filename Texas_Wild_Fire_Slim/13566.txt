[Updated at 12:08 p.m.] A plane carrying Russian, German, Swedish and former NHL hockey players crashed as it took off Wednesday afternoon from Russia's Yaroslavl airport, killing at least 43 people, Russian emergency officials said.
A Russian Emergency Situations Ministry representative said there were 45 people on the plane, including eight crew members, of whom two had survived. It had earlier said 37 people were aboard.
Twenty-nine bodies have been recovered from the crash site so far, the ministry spokesman told CNN. He added that the plane crashed on the banks of the Volga river, with parts of the plane falling to the ground and other parts into the river.
The Russian Federal Aviation Agency said earlier a number of people had survived the crash, but their condition was critical.

Check the pilots BAC l am sure it was up there. They drink constantly there and I know the vodka was flowing on that flight.  Many times seen pilots at the bar before the flights. No one cares there. Its normal.

That Yak-42 from the 60's... not too shabby. I would be scared playing in the KHL and traveling the snowy winters of Russia on a 5 decade old plane and underpaid pilots

It's not Yak-40... Crashed plane was made in 1993... Not so old.

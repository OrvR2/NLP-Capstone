The truth be known, most of the 200 Zelaya supporters were killed by MS-13 drug gang members and their deaths related to drug deals.  The MS-13 is the Honduran version of the Mexican cartels who cut off the heads of their rivals and those who will not support drug trafficking.  The truth be known, the sleazy druggies in the US are probably most responsible for their deaths.  This sounds like another Marxist lie right out of the Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lennin playbook.  Who would believe anything that a Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez supporter would tell you?  P

Whoever did this should get a medal. Here is an Indian from India living in a latin american country trying to influence their culture, government, and total way of life. This is typical for minorities moving into a country and trying to change it. Why didn't this sorryass stay in India and try to help make that shit hole into a better country?

Zelaya was a socialist anti-constitutional revolutionary.The Honduran SUPREME COURT tossed Zelaya when he & Hugo Chavez tried to unilaterally over-rule the constitution.  This Clinton/Obama ally got what he had coming..

Well, going by some of the things Yahoo posters write I'm surprised this isn't happening in the US as well.

Its regretable that this man was killed, but please remember that in Honduras, 17 people are killed each and every day, month after month, giving the country one of the highest homicide rates in the world .... it could very well be that this killing of a Zelaya supporter had absolutely nothing to do with his politics.

Well, what about the other thousands who have been murdered and their cases not solved either?

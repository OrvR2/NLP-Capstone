CIA rendition flights exposed in mundane billing lawsuitBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Thu, Sep 1, 2011

(Alamy)
The CIA's super-secret rendition program--to whisk terrorist suspects in the dark of night to CIA black sites for interrogation--has been further exposed to the light of day in rather humble fashion: a billing dispute in upstate New York.
The flight logs for a Gulfstream IV plane hired by a one-man Long Island firm are among the 1,700 pages of documentation in court records filed in conjunction with a 2007 breach-of-contract suit filed in Columbia County, New York. The records show, among other things, a curious itinerary for the plane over a four-day period in August 2003--northern Virginia's Dulles airport, Bangkok, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, Tripoli, Ireland.
As the Washington Post's Peter Finn and Julie Tate report Wednesday: "The Gulfstream IV's itinerary, as well as the $339,228.05 price tag  for  the journey, are among the details about shadowy CIA flights that  have  emerged in a small Upstate New York courthouse in a billing  dispute  between contractors."
The two contractors involved in the litigation are Richmor Aviation, a Hudson, NY-based aviation services firm which leases out private aircraft and flight crews; and Sportsflight, based in Long Island, NY, which hired Richmor to conduct dozens of flights between 2002 and 2007. Richmor, in turn, was reportedly hired by defense contractor DynCorp, working at the behest of the CIA, the Associated Press reports.
Under the arrangement, one Richmor Gulfstream with the tail number N85VM "was identified publicly in  2005 after it was used in the rendition of Abu Omar," a Milan cleric kidnapped by the CIA and sent to Egypt in 2002, the Post report explains, leading to "negative publicity, hate  mail and the loss of a management customer as a consequence," the company charged in a complaint. (You can see the tracking of other aircraft that may have been employed in the CIA rendition program here.)
In addition, "Richmor accused SportsFlight in 2007 of failing to  pay more than $1.15  million for at least 55 missions flown by planes and  crews chartered by  DynCorp for government use," the AP writes.
So Richmor did what any company might do in the midst of a bitter billing dispute:  It sued Sportsflight. And to the surprise of some of the lawyers involved in the case, no men in trench coats appeared to shut the trial down.
"I  kept waiting for [the government] to contact me," an attorney for Richmor, William F. Ryan, told the Post's Finn and Tate. "I kept thinking,   isn't  someone going to come up here and talk to me?"  But no one ever did.
And while the CIA hasn't sought to stymie the suit, the spy agency's fingerprints are pretty hard to miss in the paper trail. Among the hundreds of pages of documents filed at the courthouse during the litigation process are "logs of air-to-ground phone calls made from the plane ... [showing] multiple calls  to CIA headquarters, to the cell and home phones of a senior CIA  official involved in the rendition program, and to a government  contractor, DynCorp ... that worked for the CIA," the Post's report continues.
Richmor won the initial judgment in Jan. 2010, and this past spring, "an appeals court affirmed the decision, cutting  the judgment to $874,000," the AP reports.
Not surprisingly, CIA officials declined to comment for the story. "The CIA does  not, as a rule, comment on litigation, especially that to  which we are  not a party," CIA spokeswoman Marie E. Harf told the paper.
As for the GulfStream's breakneck Dulles-Bangkok-Afghanistan-Sri Lanka-United Arab Emirates-Triploi-Ireland itinerary in August 2003? It coincided, the Post reports, with the U.S.  apprehension of an Indonesian terrorism suspect, Riduan Isamuddin, who  was detained in Thailand, and who spent the next three years in the CIA's secret  black-site prison system. Isamuddin met in Malaysia with two of the 9/11 hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaz al-Hazmi, shortly before their arrival in California in January 2000.

The Right-Wing LOVES followers with short, convenient memories.

    But sorry, Bush will ALWAYS hold the dubious distinction as worst president, and Cheney as VP. They lied to START the war in Iraq without a plan for the aftermath of their invasion or a clue. We're left to try and clean up his and Cheney's MESS.

    And don't tell me to lay off Bush and Cheney, Freaking Rush Limbaugh and the Right has been harping on Bill Clinton for A DECADE. Get used to it— Bush and Cheney were a CATASTROPHE.

    The Republican spin machine will ALWAYS try to gloss over the reality of the Bush years. Bush was the worst President ever. Cheney was a vengeful conniving politician right out of a Hollywood movie out to stuff the pockets of his company Halliburton. Let's review The Bush-Cheney-Republican years—

    They and Republican legislators happily dismantled all the sane rules put in place to rein in the greedy excesses of big banks and Wall Street, which then set off the worst recession since the Great Depression. They ran roughshod over the Constitution and intentionally LIED to the nation with fabrications about non-existent weapons of mass destruction into going into a COMPLETELY illegal, immoral, poorly planned, poorly funded and POINTLESSLY HUMILIATING war with Iraq against all advice from our own military and EVIDENCE to the contrary, costing far more than the Health Reform Bill ever could in not only treasure (over TWO TRILLION dollars) BUT AMERICAN LIVES and world prestige. It was very wily of Bush & Co. to keep those massive military expenditures off the official national dept. And remember how then viciously attacked ANYONE who questioned their reasons to start the war as TRAITORS. And Congressional Republicans gleefully joined in. Remember Republican FREEDOM FRIES?

    Cheney ordered the outing of CIA operative Valarie Plame in revenge to get back at her husband Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson for discrediting some of the false claims the White House concocted to justify invading Iraq. Cheney's directs assistant took the fall for his boss and was convicted by an independent investigation. Whoops! Republicans would prefer we conveniently forgot that act of criminality!

    Those were good times for those who love to wave the flag while despoiling the Constitution.

The previous incumbant ran an administration that was rotton to the core.  According to multiple National Intelligence Estimates, the "policies" they followed created a national security nightmare and a string for foreign policy disasters unparalleded in United States history.   As an added bonus, they took a budegtary surplus and healthy economy and destroyed the finances of this nation.  Fortunately, if some patriotic prosecutor has the cahones, the crimes they commited int he name of the United States have no statue of limitations.

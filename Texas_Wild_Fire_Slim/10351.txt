Timber theft is a crime that affects everyone. While the timber owner feels the initial monetary loss, everyone stands to lose a natural resource - trees taken without reforestation methods in place to ensure a new forest for the future.Many timber theft cases involve absentee landowners who are more vulnerable because they aren’t around to protect their property. In these cases, the thief is often long gone by the time the crime is discovered.Another method of theft involves timber buying contracts. There are a number of scenarios, but the most common is probably that the contract is never fulfilled by the buyer.To help property owners avoid these and other timber theft tactics, the Texas Forest Service offers the following advice:Have someone you know and trust report any cutting on your land immediately.Never sign a contract without checking several references of the buyer. For the best price insist on getting bids for your timber. Mark all property lines to assure cutting on adjacent property does not encroach on yours. Most importantly, if the landowner does not know the timber business, find someone who does to help you determine volumes, current prices and potential bidders.

An empty Times Square, a closed subway system, streets flooded with water, most businesses and restaurants closed--Hurricane Irene made for a pretty surreal New York City weekend. 
Thankfully (and not surprisingly) New Yorkers had their video cameras ready to document it all before, during and after the storm. 
Watch below for an urban slip n'slide, a dreamy black and white tour of an empty, wet city, a embarrassing harrowing rescue operation, a mesmerizing time-lapse, and a walk through a soggy Lower East Side.

While some of us were waiting for Hurricane Irene Saturday night in bunkers surrounded by peanut butter and wine, others took advantage of a nearly empty Times Square to have a little fun.

Some played hockey, some played rugby,  and one woman just twirled.

For our money though, this urban slip n' slide looks like the best. Watch below for the neon-tinted version of one our city's favorite pastimes as the weaker-than-expected Irene approached New York City.

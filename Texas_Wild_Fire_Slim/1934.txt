California hangs up on cell phone driving billBy Greg Lucas | Reuters – 11 hrs ago

SACRAMENTO, Calif (Reuters) - Hold the phone! California's governor on Wednesday vetoed legislation to toughen the state's law against talking on a cell phone while driving.
The bill also would have made it illegal for California bicyclists to talk or text on mobile phones when they are riding.
Since 2008, California has barred motorists from holding a phone to their ear when they are behind the wheel. But the state allows hands-free cell use, such as with an earpiece.
A bill recently approved by the legislature would have more than doubled the first-offense fine to $50, from the current $20, for drivers caught texting or holding a cell phone to their ear. For those caught a second time, what has been a $50 fine would have grown to $100.
But because California cities and counties tack on a variety of fees and penalties to base fines set by the state, a first offense would actually have cost $328 and a second offense, $528, according to an analysis of the bill prepared for the California Senate.
"I certainly support discouraging cell phone use while driving a car but not ratcheting up the penalties as prescribed by this bill," Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, wrote in a veto message.
"For people of ordinary means, current fines and penalty assessments should be sufficient deterrent," he added.
Thirty-three states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territory of Guam ban text messaging for all drivers, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.
Besides California, 29 states and D.C. ban cell phone use altogether, earpiece or not, for drivers under the age of 18.
Meanwhile, California's original hands-free cell phone requirement and texting ban did not specifically include bicycles.
The latest bill would have corrected that and charged cyclists violating the law $20 for a first offense and $50 for subsequent offenses.
But for the time being at least, California cyclists who use a cell phone at the handlebars will get a free ride.
Brown also vetoed another bill that would have required minors to wear a helmet on the state's ski slopes.
"I am concerned about the continuing and seemingly inexorable transfer of authority from parents to the state," Brown said in vetoing that bill.

for you idiots that insist on using your cell phones while operating any moving vehicle, please pull over to the side of the road.  There are hands free options that are fairly cheap.  Use them.  If you kill someone while using your phone for calls are texting, you should recieve the death sentence for pre meditated murder.  Drunk drivers cause fewer deaths per year than texters/cell phone abusers nowadays.

Does California really want to stop people from using their phones while driving?
First offense - Existing fine plus loss of license for 30 days.
Second offense - Double existing fine plus 6 months loss of license.
Get caught driving on suspended license, 6 months at county.
That would wake people up.

Every time there is a fatality with cell phone useage involved, this decesion by Jerry Brown will come back to bite him in the political @$$.
So big Jerry is that phone or texting conversation really worth a life. I can alredy feel the heat rising on Mr Brown and I live in Texas. But it was a rather idiot choice that Mr Brown made.

They are easy, stupid, marks that need to be fleeced for their perverted addiction to phones.
Make laws with penalties that will ensure there are no second offenses.

How does one call a governor an idiot and say it nicely or a dumb *** and yet be ploiticaly correct? His only possible escuse is he may somehow be related to Bloomberg. The *** that wants us to forget ground zero.

For those of you that oppose this law and/or think the fine is too hefty I wonder if you would feel the same way if you got rear ended from a driver that was too distracted by their phone conversation to notice the traffic ahead had stopped? Or even worse!!

Outrageous fines are nothing more than the rape, plunder and pillaging of citizens to pay for extragavant government. A $50.00 fine is excessive in my book. This is a day's wages for some people. This could make the difference between eating and not eating or paying a mortgage payment and going into foreclosure. A $20 fine is plenty big enough to discourage cell phone use (which 99% of the time is not harmful or distracting or dangerous).

What I simply cannot get my head around are all the people that would even ever WANT to distract themselves with the silly pointless phone call, while operating a motor vehicle!  Turn the stupid thing OFF and drive.  Chatting with somebody – or worse and much stupider yet texting – is just moronic.  Operating a motor vehicle takes all your attention, whether you admit it or not.  It is serious business!

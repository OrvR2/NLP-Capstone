the lyrics for this song
[Pre Chours]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when
heaven is right above it we…
cause
[verse 1 – Drake]
Who else is really tryna fuck eith
Hollywood cole I’m with Marley
G bro
Flyin hollygrove chicks to my
Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something
that you
Probably should know
This that slum dog millionaire
bollywood
Flow and uhhhhhh My real
friends
Never hearing from me fake
friends
Write the wrong answers on the
mirror for me
That ’s why I pick and choose, I
don’t get shit confused
I got a small circle; I’m not with
different crews
We walk the same path but got
on different shoes
Live in the same building but we
got
Different views I got a couple
cars
I never get to use
Don ’t like my women single, I
like my chicks in
Two ’s and these days all the girls
are
Down the road I hit the strip
club, and all
Them bitches find the pole plus I
be sippin
So this shit is moving kinda slow
just tell my
Girl that tell a friend that it’s time
to go
[chours]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when
Heaven is right above it we on
It ’s Young Money motherfucka
If you ain’t runnin with it
Run from it motherfucka
Alright, now somebody show me
some
Money in this bitch and I got my
B’s
With me like some honey in this
bitch you digggg
I got my gun in my boo purse
and I
Don ’t bust back because I shoot
first
[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Meet me on the fresh train
Yes I’m in the building you just
on the list
Guest names and all of my riders
do
Not give a fuck, XGames guns
turn you boys
Into pussy, Sex change and I
smoke till I got
Chest pains, And you niggas
know I rep
My gang like Jessie James women
Are so possessive and they
wanna
Possess Wayne I been fly so long
I fell asleep on the p-p-plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me triple A, get my
Advanced in
Advance, amen as the world
spinning,
Dancing in my hands life’s a
beach,
I ’m just playing in the sand
Uh, Wake up and smell the
Pussy you niggas can ’t see me
But never overlook me I’m
On a paper trail and aint no
telling
Where it took me yea, and I ain’t
a
Killer but don’t push me
[chours]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when
Heaven is right above it we on
It ’s Young Money motherfucka
If you ain’t runnin with it
Run from it motherfucka
Alright, now somebody show me
some
Money in this bitch and I got my
B’s
With me like some honey in this
bitch you digggg
I got my gun in my boo purse
and I
Don ’t bust back because I shoot
first
[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
How do you say whats never
said?
Beautiful black women, I bet that
Bitch look better red limping off
tour
Cause I made more off my
second leg
Birr Bir Birdman JR 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start I can
hand it to
Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw
prints
We in the building you niggas in
apartments
Uh, noe come on be my blood
donor
Flow so nice you ain’t gotta put
a rug
On her do it big and let the
small fall
Under that damn where you
stumbled at?
From where they make gumbo
at Kane
Got the fucking beat jumpin like
a
Jumping jack and you know me I
Get on this bitch and have a
heart attack
Hip-Hop, I’m the heart of that
nothing short
Of that president Carter Young
Money
Democrat, Uhh
[chours]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when
Heaven is right above it we on
It ’s Young Money motherfucka
If you ain’t runnin with it
Run from it motherfucka
Alright, now somebody show me
some
Money in this bitch and I got my
B’s
With me like some honey in this
bitch you digggg
I got my gun in my boo purse

		On 08.04.10 Zanny Noble said:
My name is Zanny Shayne Noble and I am a hard rock/ heavy metal musician from Holmen, WI. I taught myself to play guitar at age 8 when I discovered the band Kiss. I wanted to shred the guitar like Ace Freley and sing like Paul Stanley. I have never given up on that dream. I am the lead singer and lead guitar player for my band Hardhat Rebellion. I am the song writer, leader, and perfectionist of the band. Being able to play all the other instruments (bass, drums, and keyboard) helps me to orchestrate the band and keep everything on point. 
My talent definately sets me apart, but I am also unique in that I am a BLACK rock/metal musician living in the midwest. My opportunities have been limited by living in a small town, but I’m a dedicated father to three children. Now that they are getting older I feel free to pursue my dream. I would love to work on bigger and better things by opening up for other big name bands and going on tour. I’ll play any show, anywhere. I am willing to collaborate with any gendre of music and already have experience working with rappers.  
I have the talent. All I need now is the opportunity.

Hi Lil, I am a promoter from Australia and my company is called Mansfield Entertainment, and i am now living in Malaysia where i run my company from.
I have shows for you in Asia and Australia when you get out, and the funny thing is, i have been chatting to you or supposed to be you on YM messenger, and we spoke about gigs and if it was you that responded to me on YM, or who ever it was on the other end of your YM told me to talk to Cash Money and gave me this email address: cashmoneystudio@gmail.com, now no one has responded from my emails to them i was asked to speak to Birdman.
Anyway, lets hook this up and do a deal for you. we also have our Record company in Australia where we would like to distriute your albums through our network worldwide, http://www.savvymuzik.com.au is our label in Australia.
All the best brother, and lets get this on the way for you, so we can get you touring all over my man.
Best 
Ian Mansfield
Mansfield Entertainment

yall are dumb as fuck. Weezey F. Baby can suck my fat throbbing cock. he’s not a good rapper. his lyrics are not good. he’s just a fad. young wayne. your dad is twice the man you’ll ever be.
freedom of speech should be limited on you cause it sounds like you’re creatin’ zombies and shit. “free weezey.” “wayne i want your baby.” “get me famous wayne” “how do i get signed to YM wayne?” 
why do you suck dick wayne. fucking you suck at rap, and don’t go back to metal. you suck at that too!


		On 08.06.10 Justin FROM montreal said:
hey lil wayne i dont like yur new tracks because your all ways on drugs and thats not being a role model. being rich and fame is not every thing keep in mind that the way you are is the way you want the next generation to be all doped up on drug! think about it if the presdent is all doped up on drugs (like bush was) nothing gets done just more killings and more hatred.
Look at eminem he went to rehab and thought about what was going on so use the jail time to really think about the next wave of singers and rappers or even lawyers and judges, we as a socity should look at these things and really look because to make a difference we gotta start with ourselfs. thanks for reading and understanding

yea mon, Wayne, one of the best, if not the best, along with Slim. I rock out loud to your sounds every day, blasting tru the streets of Exuma, letting all the haters know, that there’s an invasion, and we gona pick the world up and drop it on there f***in heads.I never saw u in concert, it is hard in the Bahamas to see you in concert because you don’t come this side, well at least I never heard you comin this side, but if you did, for sure, I would be there. peace young money.

lil wayne it takes one strong willed person to come from the streets or with just the absolutes and actually reach their goals. now days that is pretty rare. my husband and I have been locked up and now are on the straight and narrow so I feel ya it sucks. I like the truthness to all your lyrics and don’t forget how without the fans and our support groups you/they would not be where they are today. You always tell your fans  U love them and answer there mail that takes dedication.  your one hell of a man!!!!!! you never have changed to suit anybody but,just keeping it real and saying this is me you also said in an interview i’ve never forgotten where you came from you don’t try to do all the bling bling shit that’s what I think and love about you. I read the poem on mothers day and I cried it was so true and it came from the heart. never give up keep turn the cd’s out cause I know I will be buy’n. I will be praying for you in and out of lock up. God be with you and Bless you weezy. just keep it real

May GOD of ur understanding bless u and ur family. Yo! I know how it feels to be away from ur people right now but {Like tu-pac said}keep ur head up and never look down. I always told myself this:  NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAD DONE IN THE PAST,YOUR FUTURE IS ALWAYS SPOTLESS!!! so get out and let them feel ur pain by ur music. one love until u come home.     lil man  {flatline records inc}

Hey Weezy, Kinda not so suprise cos i know very sure you will be release from jail, I really like most of your flow and rap cos something make me think that truely ppl got haters and enemies arround but you just dont have to look up too them, All you need tell them is fork you Haters and leave up your life, You once said it mostly in your song, sometime i copy down your lyric and begin follow up most of your song, Weezy you da boooooom, Cant wait to see you get out from there and please make a new song with LIL TWIST cos he is ur blood, I really love him too….I aint in the state but wish am there cos i cant just do a moment without listning to ur flows.

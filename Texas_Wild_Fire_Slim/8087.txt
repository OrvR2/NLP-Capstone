Kiefer Sutherland says he was shocked and heartbroken by Jack Layton's deathBy Michael Oliveira, The Canadian Press | The Canadian Press – Sat, 10 Sep, 2011 4:24 PM EDT

TORONTO - Canadian actor Kiefer Sutherland says he was shocked and heartbroken by the death of former federal NDP leader Jack Layton, and he is still coming to grips with it.Sutherland, who is in town to promote "Melancholia" at the Toronto International Film Festival, says he had been speaking with Layton throughout the federal election campaign and after the NDP's stunning ascension to become the official Opposition.But he lost touch with Layton after he revealed that he'd had a setback in his cancer treatment."I got a message like, 'I'm sick again, I've got to deal with this,' and then he got very quiet and I didn't hear from him again. He'd been fighting it for so long and beating it — it was under control — and then for it to (strike again) like that I was absolutely stunned when that happened, it was heartbreaking," says Sutherland, who spoke softly and fought for composure as he paid tribute to Layton."It was just such an exciting time for him ... just take a look at what he did in Quebec, he got people to believe there was a shot to do something, and he deserves to have that as his legacy."He inspired people and made them believe in a time, in an economy, that no one believes in anything and he got them to really think there was a shot to make this place better."Layton died on Aug. 22.Sutherland's grandfather is Tommy Douglas, the former premier of Saskatchewan and the first federal leader of the NDP.

Compared to a guy like Rob Ford Layton loved ALL people. He showed up front and center at Pride Day. Where as Ford snubbed it in a sarcastic way but turned up at Caribana. Probably cause of all the food for the fat beady eyed PIG!! Jack loved everybody and embraced all types of lifestyles. He was a great man and will be so missed. Not to mention he was VERY good looking. Rest in peace Jack!!

It doesn't matter what citizenship is Kiefer, the fact he is a Canadian and comes to Canada so often.  He has to go where he needs to work as Canada don't provide enough work for the Canadian actors/actresses.  That is why John Candy moved to California.  Before he died, his goal to set up a huge film industry so that the Canadian actors/actresses, writers, producers, directores can work in Canada.  As for Jack Layton, it is rare that the NDP was able to do what he did especially with Quebec during the election.  NDP is for people, farmers, low/limited income people, seniors, people with disabilites while PC and Liberals are not!!  Get it??!!

Poor Kiefer, I wonder what else he is thinking that is as equally news worthy as this.

Jack Layton was a rarity on the Canadian political scene.  He was one of a very few individuals who actually earned the privilege of using the title Honourable in front of his name.

It was refreshing to know that Jack Layton's character was solid. He fought for the people, he was true to himself, his family, and fellow Canadian's. How many Politician's do you know that are true to their character both on camera and off camera? More importantly, how many people do you know who demonstrate core values like Jack Layton in the Corporate or the Retail Sector? Do you have a Boss that puts your needs ahead of their own? Do you have a Boss that motivates you, and makes you feel like you can accomplish anything? Chances are the answer is NO!! 
I applaud Keifer for sharing his thoughts with fellow Canadians, about the tragic loss of Jack Layton, and whether you (the negative people writing comments) want to admit it or not we lost one of the best Canadian Men that lived when Jack died.

He does have a resemblance to his grandfather. Great to know he keeps in touch with his roots here in Canada.

I like Kiefer, but why ar actors always lefties. I guess because they never worry about where the next paycheck comes from.

Keifer is Canadian,as are his parents!(Both actors as well.His mother is Tommy Douglas' daughter.)

Does everyone miss this picture or what. Jack and Keifer were friends, and he was speaking kindly of his friend. This is not a political debate. He chose to speak of some of Jack's accomplishments. I believe that Keifer was born in Canada and may hold dual citizenship, both his parents are Canadian. I do not follow his career so am not sure of his citizenship, but you know what, it doesn't matter, he was speaking kind words for his deceased FRIEND.

Kiefer has it right to compare the two, just because he works in the US doesn't mean he is ignorant of what is going on here...the Tory trolls what to trash him because Harper could never get this kind of recognition. The only person of historical signifcance that Harper compares to would be Hitler.

More BS From Obama’s Cabinet: ‘US vows action against Pakistan-based insurgents’

Sep 15th


Posted by Crisis Jones in 911

(AFP) – 1 hour ago
SAN FRANCISCO — Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Wednesday warned the United States would retaliate against insurgents based in Pakistan blamed for staging a dramatic attack in the Afghan capital.
A day after a 19-hour assault staged near the US embassy and NATO headquarters, Panetta expressed frustration that the Pakistani government has so far failed to crack down on Haqqani network militants that Washington suspects carried out Tuesday’s attack.
“Time and again we’ve urged the Pakistanis to exercise their influence over these kinds of attacks from the Haqqanis and we’ve made very little progress in that area,” Panetta told reporters aboard his plane before landing in San Francisco.
“I’m not going to talk about how we’re going to respond. I’ll just let you know that we’re not going to allow these kinds of attacks to go on,” he said.
Panetta’s tough words come amid strained relations with Islamabad following the US raid that killed Osama bin Laden at his Pakistani hideout on May 2, a raid that Panetta oversaw while he was CIA director. Islamabad’s leaders had no advance word of the secret operation, which has caused anger and soul-searching in Pakistan.
As head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Panetta also presided over a dramatic expansion in drone bombing raids in Pakistan, with robotic aircraft targeting Al-Qaeda and Taliban militants in the country’s northwest tribal areas.
US officials have for years demanded Islambad move against the Haqqani network, which operates in part out of sanctuaries inside Pakistan’s borders.
Before the Kabul attack, the US military blamed the Haqqani militants for a truck bombing on Saturday against a NATO base in Wardak province that wounded 77 American troops.
The 19-hour Taliban assault on Kabul turned the city’s most heavily secured district into a battle zone. Fifteen people were killed and six foreign troops wounded in the attack.

Protest of government-financial ‘coziness’ planned for Wall Street area on Sept. 17th

Occupy Wall Street’s
call to action



Activists who object to what they see as the coziness between the U.S. Government and the nation’s largest financial institutions are planning twin protests on Saturday, September 17th.
One protest, called Occupy Wall Street, will supposedly take place in the “real world,” somewhere near Wall Street, in lower Manhattan. The other protest, known as US Day of Rage, is apparently going to unfold in cyberspace, perhaps with the active participation of the hacktivist group, ‘Anonymous.’
“This is something for everyone to take seriously,” said Jordan Loyd, a special agent in the FBI’s New York City field office, who spoke at an InfraGard cyber defense conference in Manhattan on September 14.
“The protesters find Wall Street to be the ‘hub’ for the government’s cooperation with large corporations,” Loyd added.
He predicted the cyber and real-world protest would happen in New York City, “all over the country,” and also abroad, but did not specify the form or content of the protests he was anticipating.
The organizers of Occupy Wall Street explained themselves in a poster available online.
“The perpetrators of the massive financial fraud have been allowed to slip quietly from the scene and continue business as usual,” says the flyer. “Our elected representatives in Washington have become so tightly intertwined with the financiers and bankers that public accountability has all but vanished. #OCCUPYWALLSTREET is all about breaking up that cosy relationship between money and politics and bringing the perpetrators of the financial crash of 2008 to justice.”
Loyd advised organizations (particularly major financial institutions, which are likely to be targets of the twin protests) to secure their wireless networks, among other precautions. “That will definitely be a factor on September 17,” Loyd declared.
News and comments about the planned protests are being carried at the Twitter hash tag #Sept17.

Why? Because what we have been doing is so obviously NOT working that’s why. I thought about that this morning as I read about the upcoming “Day of Rage” that is scheduled to take place on Saturday Sept 17 and includes a march on Wall Street. There have been many marches on Wall Street and what has changed?  Our Congress still votes to turn over billions of our taxpayer dollars to Wall Street crooks.  Congress is not responsive to the voice of  the majority.  They care more about their own Wall Street stock portfolios than they care about the American people.  There has been no recession for them.

Ralph Nader speaks to a crowd in front of the stock exchange.  Nader denounced the Wall Street Bailout plan and urged drastically increased regulation of the nation’s financial system.

(Jonathan Weeks/The Epoch Times)
April 4 and 5th – 2009 Two Day Wall Street Protest
In a nationally coordinated effort in six cities held on a Friday and Saturday in 2009 (The Saturday rally timed to coincide with the April 4 anniversary  of  the day Martin Luther King Jr. was shot in Memphis in 1968. The crowd was showing the spirit of revolution that was present in the ’60s and ’70s when the people forced the government to change their agenda.  The people were angry over the lack of transparency concerning where money from President obama’s economic bailout plan was going.  Remember the AIG bailout?  They got $180.5 billion of our federal money.  We do know that Goldman Sachs got $12 billion of that. We do know that the people from the 80% club got nothing. The crowds of 500 on Friday and 1,000 on Saturday were smaller than anticipated but they did draw participants from other states.  Read more here.

April 29, 2010 New York City  (Altaffer/NYDaily News)
Groups called for banks to be held accountable for their role in the economic crisis.  Hours before this rally, more than 100 people entered a midtown building housing JPMorgan Chase offices.  They handed a letter to the building worker and chanted “Bust up big banks”  The protesters then walked a few blocks and crowded into a Wells Fargo building lobby.   The banks did not respond to requests for comment.  JPMorgan’s response for helping the people?  They announced that they will stop financing tax-refund loans for about 13,000 independent preparers in a move that could drive customers toward H&R Block, higher fees and loss of more money for the average American. That is a response to be expected from a bully.  Just recently (Sept 2011) Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase suggesting withdrawing from an international banking group because it was suggesting that banks back their bets with at least 9.5% capital.  [Imagine what Jamie would tell YOU if you wanted a mortgage and were only willing to guarantee it with 9.5% of the value of your home?]
_____________________________________________________
It is time to bust up the big banks! and a few other monopolies like General Electric and Exxon Mobil too!  But protests in the streets may not be the way to do it.   2008, 2009, 2010 and  these are not all the protests by a long shot that have been held on Wall Street since the US Congress totally ignored the American people and used taxpayer money to bail out Wall Street as George Bush’s parting gift to the rich.  And there is a new protest scheduled to begin Saturday, September 17.*  Protesters are invited to bring their tents and camp out on Wall Street for several months.  This protest may garner more attention than previous Wall Street protests–particularly since people are a helluva lot angrier and the chances of Americans getting hurt run high on this one.  If that were to happen, there might be a public outpouring, a tide of indignation against the pigs on Wall Street and in Congress to effect some change.  Perhaps, but I’m not entirely convinced if the police murdered people on the street if that would change anything.  Remember Kent State?  They shot young students and that changed nothing.

*Note:  In case you haven’t heard, September 17 is designated as a Day of Rage with over 18 events scheduled all over the USA.
___________________________________________________
You want things changed?  You want a Congress of non-millionaires that responds to the majority instead of to Wall Street investors?
Then kick every last member of the U.S. House out of office in 2012 because you will never get what you want until you do–even if you throw bricks through their windows.
This is my dream for my country.  It is not only a totally attainable goal, but it is also an easily achievable goal.  Of course all Senators are not up for re-election in 2012, and it is more difficult to run for a Senatorial seat–especially in larger states because it does require money to cover  a territory as large as many states.  The same may be said for the office of President.  [Still, in some of the smaller states, it is possible to go after the Senate seats as well so don't let me discourage you.]
However, in most cases, all U.S. Congressional Districts in the USA can be managed with a budget of under $5,000 and a core of at least 50 dedicated volunteers.  It is entirely possible for ordinary Americans who are not millionaires and who are not fake astro turf Koch Tea Baggers to take over Congress.
_______________________________________________
RUN FOR OFFICE YOURSELF!
I am completely convinced that we can change things in our nation by running for office ourselves as Independents and by voting for other Americans who are doing the same.  These are the steps that you must take now, today, if you want to run for U.S. Congressional Representative for your District in 2012.
1. Go to your state elections website and find out what the steps are for running as an Independent candidate in your state. These requirements vary from state to state, but many states require that you file an intent to run as an Independent sometime this fall Prior to January of 2012.  In Texas, the time for filing your intent to run is between November 12 and December 12, 2011.
2. Check out all the other requirements to make sure that you meet them all.  Make a calendar now of the important deadlines and dates for filing various papers.  Download and print out all required forms now.  If you are running as an Independent, this means that you will likely have to gather signatures of registered voters in your district. [Most often you cannot being these efforts until after the 2012 primary is held in your state.]  There is a form that you will have to use to record those signatures.
3. Write your platform.   See my platform for  an example.  http://iflizwerequeen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Platform-for-US-Congressional-Representative.pdf
4.  Identify 10 key issues and write your solutions to each key issue.  cut it down to a 30 second sound byte.
5.  In November,  walk door to door in a several block radius of your home inviting people over for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon to your home/apartment and or to a local cafe if that works better for you.  The goal of this meeting is to tell them what you think about things. your plan, and to listen to what they think and their solutions.  You want to already have a date scheduled for another meeting in December and ask them to each bring one person with them.
You can do it!  We can do it.  We can change our government by using the democratic process that is in place.  There are those who tell us that it is broken–I’m telling you  that there is NOTHING wrong with the process other than the fact that people like us are not using it.  They have bought into the myth of the wealthy that it takes hundreds of thousands of dollars to win a race.  That is a lie.
Here is another Document for you:  SO YOU WANT TO RUN FOR OFFICE.  YOU CAN!

Massive New Radiation Releases Possible from Fukushima … Especially If Melted Core Materials Hit Water

Sep 15th

Governments Underreported Severity of Fukushima
As I’ve noted for 6 months, the Japanese and U.S. governments have continually under-reported the severity of the nuclear crisis at Fukushima.
The Wall Street Journal points out:
 
The Japanese government initially underestimated radiation releases from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, in part because of untimely rain, and so exposed people unnecessarily, a report released this week by a government research institute says.
PhysOrg writes:
The amount of radiation released during the Fukushima nuclear disaster was so great that the level of atmospheric radioactive aerosols in Washington state was 10,000 to 100,000 times greater than normal levels in the week following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that triggered the disaster.
***
[A] study [by University of Texas engineering professor Steven Biegalski and researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory] reports that more radioxenon was released from the Fukushima facilities than in the 1979 meltdown at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania and in the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Ukraine.
Biegalski said the reason for the large release in Fukushima, when compared to the others, is that there were three nuclear reactors at the Japan facilities rather than just one.
Nuclear expert Arnie Gundersen notes:
New TEPCO data measured on August 19 & 20 shows severe damage to the spent fuel in Fukushima Daiichi Units 1, 2, and 3…. This TEPCO data clearly contradicts and refutes the July assertion by the NRC the Fukushima Daiichi spent fuel pools were not damaged in this tragic accident.
There are also several unconfirmed reports that the Japanese government is trying to keep people from buying geiger counters to measure radiation.
New, Large Radiation Releases Are Possible
Mainichi Dailly News notes:
 
As a radiation meteorology and nuclear safety expert at Kyoto University’s Research Reactor Institute, Hiroaki Koide [says]:
The nuclear disaster is ongoing.
***
At present, I believe that there is a possibility that massive amounts of radioactive materials will be released into the environment again.
At the No. 1 reactor, there’s a chance that melted fuel has burned through the bottom of the pressure vessel, the containment vessel and the floor of the reactor building, and has sunk into the ground. From there, radioactive materials may be seeping into the ocean and groundwater.
***
The government and plant operator TEPCO are trumpeting the operation of the circulation cooling system, as if it marks a successful resolution to the disaster. However, radiation continues to leak from the reactors. The longer the circulation cooling system keeps running, the more radioactive waste it will accumulate. It isn’t really leading us in the direction we need to go.
It’s doubtful that there’s even a need to keep pouring water into the No.1 reactor, where nuclear fuel is suspected to have burned through the pressure vessel. Meanwhile, it is necessary to keep cooling the No. 2 and 3 reactors, which are believed to still contain some fuel, but the cooling system itself is unstable. If the fuel were to become overheated again and melt, coming into contact with water and trigger a steam explosion, more radioactive materials will be released.
***
We are now head to head with a situation that mankind has never faced before.
Mainichi also reports:
The Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) and residents of the zone between 20 and 30 kilometers from the stricken Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant held an emergency evacuation drill on Sept. 12 … in preparation for any further large-scale emission of radioactive materials from the plant.
***
The scenario for the drill presupposed further meltdown of the Fukushima plant’s No. 3 reactor core, and a local accumulation of radioactive materials emitting 20 millisieverts of radiation within the next four days. …
And nuclear expert Paul Gunter says that we face a “China Syndrome”, where the fuel from the reactor cores at Fukushima have melted through the container vessels, into the ground, and are hitting groundwater and creating highly-radioactive steam:

No this ain’t META, baby.
THIS is about JOBS. And JUSTICE. And EQUALITY.
On August 11, 2011, the activist group People’s Organization for Progress in Newark New Jerseystarted a 381-day boycott calling on the U.S. government to institute a jobs program. Citing the nearly 17% unemployment rate among African Americans, the POP embarked on a boycott modeled after the 381-day Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56 which resulted in a supreme court ruling that segregated seating in public buses was unconstitutional.
For your “listening while reading” enjoyment:


 

Protesters in Newark have vowed to stand in front of the courthouse everyday for the coming year.
No word yet about their response to Obama’s recently unveiled jobs program.
BUT WAIT THERE’S MORE
There’s something YOU can do. Here are some other ACTIVE protests happening soon. These are not one day events. These are on-going occupations. check it:
OCCUPY WALL STREET
Beginning September 17 (that’s this Saturday) at 12 noon at Bowling Green in NYC.
Goal: 20,000 people to flood into lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street for a few months. Once there, we shall incessantly repeat one simple demand in a plurality of voices and we will not leave until that demand has been met. Like our brothers and sisters in Egypt, Greece, Spain, and Iceland, we plan to use the revolutionary Arab Spring tactic of mass occupation to restore democracy in America. (Yeah, it’s vague. I know. But, hey. Gotta start somewhere. I’d settle for taxing the bastards. I’d be ecstatic with some arrests. Just sayin’. Maybe once the 20,000 people show up…we can decide…;)
Note: this occupation is “leaderless” and many groups have helped organize it including We Are the 99%, Adbusters and the US Day of Rage. Anonymous also put out YouTube in support of it. They are reported to be involved as well.
Want more?
OCTOBER 2011
This one’s happening in DC. And again, it’s an occupation, not a day of protest. It’s motto: Human needs, not human greed.  They say that since the majority of Americans favor the following agenda: tax the rich and corporations, ends the wars, bring troops home, cut military spending, protect and strengthen the social safety net, transition to a clean energy economy, protect worker rights and get money out of politics, they are calling on all who seek peace, economic justice, human rights and a healthy environment—to join together in Washington, D.C., beginning on Oct. 6, 2011, in nonviolent resistance similar to the Arab Spring and the Midwest awakening.
Both of these occupations’ websites have information and resources available, including ride sharing and accommodations. People seem to be ready and willing. Together we are able. We can CHANGE the rhetoric. We can CHANGE the debate. We can CREATE a movement and make a statement that cannot be ignored.
Are you getting excited yet? I am. There’s something in the air, baby. It’s TIME. Finally the tables are starting to turn. Talkin’ ’bout a revolution.
P.S. The October 2011 project has a live stream discussion tonight. If you’re in DC you can catch it in-person at Busboys and Poets Bookstore. If not, check the stream here beginning at 6 p.m. eastern time. TOPIC: “How to Shift the Power to the People.”
UPDATED: This is what happened in Israel after ONE WOMAN decided to “camp out” because she was fed up. Movements start with a few. They can be broadly defined or very specific at the beginning. But they can turn into this: (h/t to The Troubadour)

If you cant make the occupation, you can still support those who are there. Here’s how.
Several people have asked: if I can’t make it to New York City for the occupation, but still want to help, what can I do?
One of many answers is to support those who are at the occupation on Wall Street by calling various delivery places in the area and having food sent to the site. Not only will you be providing food to hungry people, you will also be supporting local establishments as opposed to corporate chains. A list has been compiled of several pizzerias, health food places, and delis around the occupation area from which you can call and order food. The list can be found here
I’ll add that if you live nearby but still can’t hang out, consider making something like beans and rice or bringing by some fruit on your way to work. Or beverages.

Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, gestures during a Republican presidential debate on Sept. 12, 2011, in Tampa.


During the Sept. 12, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas — a staunch advocate of limited government and a more modest military footprint — offered a surprising statistic about the reach of the U.S. armed forces.
“We’re under great threat, because we occupy so many countries,” Paul said. “We’re in 130 countries. We have 900 bases around the world. We’re going broke. The purpose of al-Qaida was to attack us, invite us over there, where they can target us. And they have been doing it. They have more attacks against us and the American interests per month than occurred in all the years before 9/11, but we’re there occupying their land. And if we think that we can do that and not have retaliation, we’re kidding ourselves. We have to be honest with ourselves. What would we do if another country, say, China, did to us what we do to all those countries over there?”
That statement includes a lot of different claims, but we’re going to focus on just one of them here that a reader asked us to check — that the U.S. military “is in 130 countries. We have 900 bases around the world.”
We’ll split this into two parts — checking whether the U.S. military has personnel in 130 countries, and whether the U.S. has 900 overseas military bases.
Personnel
For the personnel question, we turned to a Sept. 30, 2010, Pentagon document titled, “Active Duty Military Personnel Strengths by Regional Area and by Country.”
We tallied up all the countries with at least one member of the U.S. military, excluding those with personnel deemed to be “afloat.” We found U.S. military personnel on the ground in a whopping 148 countries — even more than Paul had said. (There are varying standards for what constitutes a “country,” so that may explain the divergence from Paul’s number.)
However, we should add a caveat. In 56 of these 148 countries, the U.S. has less than 10 active-duty personnel present. These include such obscure locales as Mongolia, Nepal, Gabon, Togo and Suriname.
By contrast, the U.S. has disclosed only 13 countries outside the United States and its possessions that are host to more than 1,000 personnel. They are: Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Japan, Bahrain, Djibouti, South Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait.
In addition, this is a snapshot of the global military footprint, so it may not include all temporary training missions and humanitarian assistance activities. “Such activities are so pervasive you almost have to wonder how the other 70 countries manage to avoid hosting such operations,” said John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, a national security think tank.
Bases
For this question, we turned to an official Pentagon accounting of U.S. military bases around the nation and the world, the “Base Structure Report, Fiscal 2010 Baseline.”
According to this report, the U.S. has 662 overseas bases in 38 foreign countries, which is a smaller number than the 900 bases Paul cited. But here again, the list omits several nations integral to active operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, so it’s conceivable that the actual number of sites approaches 900.
The Pentagon “is very reluctant to label anything a ‘base’ because of the negative political connotations associated with it,” said Alexander Cooley, a political scientist at Barnard College and Columbia University who studies overseas bases. “Some of these facilities, such as the Manas Transit Center in Kyrgyzstan, may not be officially counted as ‘bases,’ but it is the most important U.S. facility in central Asia, staging every U.S. soldier transiting in and out of Afghanistan and conducting refueling operations.”
Still, caveats are in order here, too. Of the 662 overseas sites listed — that is, those outside the active war zones — all but 32 of them are either small sites (with a replacement value of less than $915 million) or sites essentially owned on paper only.
For instance, the sole site listed for Canada is 144 square feet of leased space — equal to a 12-foot-by-12-foot room. That’s an extreme case, but other nations on the list — such as Aruba, Iceland, Indonesia, Kenya, Norway and Peru — have just a few U.S. military buildings, many of them leased. Some of the sites are unmanned radio relay towers or other minor facilities. “Most of them are a couple of acres with a cyclone fence and no troops,” Pike said.
Cooley said that the “true figure is tough to determine and involves judgment calls about the nature and purpose” of the activities involved. “The fact that host countries often choose not to disclose a U.S. military presence adds to perceptions of a ‘secret network’ ” that is larger than the officially disclosed number of bases.
Our ruling
Given the incomplete figures available from the Pentagon, Paul’s topline figures — 130 nations, 900 bases — are plausible when active military operations are included. “My eyebrows were raised many times” during the debate, Pike said, but this comment “was not one of those times.”
Still, we think it’s worth pointing out that many of the personnel deployments and facilities included in Paul’s number are fairly minimal in nature. On balance, we rate Paul’s statement Mostly True.

“The computer hackers, chat room denizens and young people who comprise the loosely affiliated Internet collective have increasingly turned to questionable tactics, drawing the attention of the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal investigator,” says the Associated Press.


In other words, Anonymous is making itself felt.
“What was once a small group of pranksters has become a potential national security threat, federal officials say, according to , which goes on, “The FBI has carried out more than 75 raids and arrested 16 people this year in connection with illegal hacking jobs claimed by Anonymous, says AP.
In short, the DHSS,FBI, Obushma administration’ and other outfits which are supposed to act on behalf of the people, but which act only on behalf of themselves  and their corporate owners are seriously worried.
Since June, the Department of Homeland Security has issued three “bulletins” warning cyber-security professionals (not to mention the’ financial sector’ ) of hacking successes and future threats by Anonymous and related groups, including a call to physically occupy Manhattan’s Wall Street on Sept. 17 in protest of various US government policies.

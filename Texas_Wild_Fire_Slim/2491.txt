For the second time in a month, authorities in Virginia are investigating a former deputy sheriff who has ties to the Colonial Parkway murders -- a series of unsolved homicides that began in 1986 along the scenic 23-mile route between Jamestown and Yorktown -- in Virginia.
On Wednesday, police in Gwinnett County, Ga., arrested 62-year-old Fred Atwell. The former Gloucester, Va., deputy is accused of robbing a woman in Roanoke County at gunpoint Tuesday. Atwell reportedly took less than $100 and told the victim he had been living in the woods and was hungry. 
In 2009, Atwell was considered something of a hero when he discovered a number of crime scene photographs regarding the Colonial Parkway homicides had been inappropriately taken from the FBI's Norfolk office. The photographs were being used as a training tool for a security company, and a number of the images had been leaked to the media. 
The two-decade-old puzzle of the Colonial Parkway murders had pretty much fizzled out at the time the photos were uncovered.
Due to the shared location and other similarities, some suspect the killings are the work of a possible serial killer. But since the first one took place in October 1986, the murders have all remained unsolved. 
The first two victims were Cathleen Marian Thomas, a 27-year-old stockbroker in Norfolk and Rebecca Ann Dowski, a 21-year-old business management major from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg.
On the evening of Oct. 9, 1986, Thomas and Dowski had been hanging out with two friends at a computer lab when they left to spend some time together. What happened to them after that remained a mystery until three days later, when a jogger running along the York River by the Colonial Parkway spotted Thomas' white Honda Civic on the edge of an embankment. Both women had been strangled, and their throats were cut. 
Virginia authorities found themselves in the middle of a second double homicide when the bodies of David Lee Knobling, 20, from Hampton, and Robin M. Edwards, a 14-year-old girl from Newport News, turned up in the Ragged Island Wildlife Refuge the following fall. Both had been shot in the back of the head.
Roughly six months later, on April 9, 1987, college student Richard "Keith" Call, 20, went out on his first date with Cassandra Lee Hailey, 18, from Grafton. The following day, Call's vehicle was found abandoned at the York River Overlook on the Colonial Parkway. Multiple searches were conducted for Call and Hailey, but no other trace of them has ever been found.
Less than two years later, Annamarie Phelps, 18, and a friend of Phelps' boyfriend, 21-year-old Daniel Lauer, disappeared over Labor Day weekend in 1989. Lauer's car was found abandoned at a rest area on the westbound side of I-64. That October, a hunter came upon the couple's skeletal remains less than a mile from the rest area. They had been stabbed to death.
Over the years, many theories have surfaced regarding the person or persons responsible. Last year, criminal profiler Pat Brown shared her own theory with AOL News -- a theory that centers on the fact that in some of the cases, the victims' driver's window had been rolled down.
"This would indicate someone approached the vehicle and was likely thought to be a police officer," she said.  
Brown also said the perpetrator could be involved in law enforcement or, more likely, "wished he were."
"He wanted authority and probably did not have it," she said. "His crimes gave him this feeling: He was able to surprise, control and punish 'wrongdoers.'"
WATCH (ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW VIDEO):

Atwell's discovery of the 84 graphic photographs brought a lot of much-needed media attention back to the unsolved homicides. And, as unsavory as the crime scene photos revelation was, it appeared to kick the investigation of the homicides back into high gear. Almost immediately, the FBI announced it was conducting a top-to-bottom review of the cases in its jurisdiction.
While the FBI and the Virginia State Police looked into the Colonial Parkway cases, the families of the victims joined together to support each other and conduct their own investigation into the cases. During this time, Atwell became a constant figure among them.
"He always tried to insert himself into the investigation and into the families," Thomas' brother, Bill Thomas, told The Huffington Post.
In the beginning, the support was appreciated but over time, Atwell began acting strange, according to Thomas.
"He would spin the most elaborate tales you've ever heard," he said. "Last January he called me and said he had been contacted by an attorney outside the country who claimed to have a client who was involved in the murders. He said they wanted $20,000 to reveal the locations where Keith and Cassandra's bodies could be found. The tale got more fantastic as it went on. We were very skeptical and at some point in the spring he dropped it."
Last month, Atwell was arrested in connection with an alleged phony car raffle, in which all of the proceeds were to go to "The Colonial Parkway Victims Fund." Investigators do not yet know how much money, if any, Atwell pocketed from the raffle but they say he cashed a check for $270 that was supposed to go for Department of Motor Vehicle fees related to the nonexistent cars. 
"We're still trying to deal with it. It's unexpected. We really felt he was on our side and then found out he was not," Jennifer Phelps, sister-in-law of Annamaria Phelps, told The Huffington Post.
According to Thomas, Atwell and his wife recently separated and he "has been wandering around in some capacity," he said.
Thomas also said Atwell made an interesting call to police following the alleged robbery he committed earlier this week.
"He called [a] suicide hotline and said that he is suicidal, a suspect in a serial murder [investigation] and wanted to commit suicide by cop," Thomas said. 
Authorities have yet to confirm whether the call took place.
For the third time in recent years, Atwell has cast a spotlight on the Colonial Parkway murders -– albeit not in a manner in which the victims families are very happy about.
"We're a little less likely to accept outside help. We're a little less trusting," Phelps said. "We're just trying to get through this and let the police finish their investigation. Then we'll pick up and move on."
Thomas said he is left wondering why Atwell has had such a strong interest in the case.
"I often wonder if he knows something he is not telling us," Thomas said. "If he does, I hope he comes forward with that information soon."

				From my family's point of view, let me clear that we are not saying the Fred Atwell is behind the Colonial Parkway Murders.  I am sure that the FBI will thoroughly check out Atwell's whereabout­s over the last two years, as well as the timeframe of the murders from 1986 to 1989.  Atwell was a Deputy Sheriff in Gloucester County, VA during that time.

The bottom line is that each of these cases need to be looked at independen­tly.  Two of these cases (Thomas/Do­wski and Call/Haile­y) are FBI cases, and two (Phelps/La­uer and Edwards/Kn­obling) are Virginia State Police cases.  I call on both agencies to devote additional resources to finally solve these murders.   If we get lucky, other related murder cases including the Virginia Route 29 Stalker case and the murder of Julie Williams and Lollie Winans in the Shenadoah National Park (both in 1996) may also break.  The Williams/W­inans case is remarkably similar to the Thomas/Dow­ski case in 1986.  There are a number of unsolved murders in Virginia from that time.  Isn't it time we solved a few of them?

				Why would a serial killer rob a woman, explain to her why he's robbing her, and then not kill her? The crimes were brutal, this guy is a gnat. Pat Brown's profile that the open window meant the killer was a cop or cop wannabe, did she make it after reading the old news story about how they suspected the killer was a cop or cop wannabe because the glove compartmen­t was open "as if" the driver may have reached for their registrati­on and license? The cars were moved before investigat­ors arrived on the scene and the crime scenes were contaminat­ed. How does anyone know what was done by the cops arriving at the scene or by the actual killers? The cops may have opened the glove compartmen­ts and wallets looking for ID.
The people were killed in pairs but one man could not strangle a woman, cut her throat, and the other one not run away. Even if he had a gun I would assume that it takes two hands to strangle someone. The killings went on for three years and the killer(s) is presumed dead according to another news story. Most likely in jail for another crime... but why not make a killer out of a con, have a trial by media, and give the family some peace while the real killers remain free.

				Many thanks to reporter David Lohr for this well written update on my sister Cathy Thomas and her friend Rebecca Dowski's case and those of all of the Colonial Parkway Murders.  Time will tell if Fred Atwell was involved in any of the murders or perhaps in a coverup of one or more-- the FBI continues to investigat­e.  

Strangely, the Colonial Parkway Murders families owe Fred Atwell a debt of gratitude even if he was involved, since it was Atwell's whistleblo­wing about the FBI and Virginia State Police losing control of the 84 highly graphic crime scene photos that jumpstarte­d the investigat­ion in Fall 2009.  This October will mark the 25 anniversar­y of the start of these still unsolved murders.

				The Colonial Parkway Murders were profiled by the FBI and the Virginia State Police in the 1986-1990 timeframe.  We understand that the FBI is going to reprofile two of the cases (Thomas/Do­wski and Call/Haile­y) in Fall 2011, which we are told is extremely unusual. 

The other two Colonial Parkway cases (Phelps/La­uer and Edwards/Kn­obling) are Virginia State Police cases, and any profiling would be done by the VSP Bureau of Criminal Investigat­ion.  There are other unsolved murders in Virginia in the same time period which may be related to the Colonial Parkway Murders as well.

				With this mans help an investigat­ion into the beltway shootings was reopened..­.That is the good side of this man. Then he conducted a raffle and committed a robbery. He clams he does not know where the money to the raffle went and neither do we until it comes out, if indeed it does. We know he did the robbery; He admitted to that, and the reason he gave was that his wife kicked him out and he was living in the woods, hungry and without food. The parts of these stories..p­art one, and then part two, being the raffle, the robbery, being kicked out of his home by his wife to go it alone in the woods without food just does not tie in together. Two completely separate stories about two very different points in this mans life!

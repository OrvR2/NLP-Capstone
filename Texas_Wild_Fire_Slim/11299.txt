This review is from: Vicks Vapor Inhaler Soothing Vicks Vapors Nasal Decongestant .007 oz. (Health and Beauty)


The design of the Vicks Inhalor is one of the reasons it is so popular.  No bigger than a chapstick, you can carry it anywhere.  The two primary ingredients are the reliable Vicks Vapors and another medicine, L-Desoxyephedrine which can show up on some drug tests as an Amphetamine.  That's why you should keep the card that it comes attached to in the event that your employer tests you shortly after you've used it.  
 The medications in the inhalor are very powerful and you should follow the instructions carefully.  Inhaling it more frequently than directed can cause nasal irritation.  This is a good product to have on hand when you need something to blast through serious stuffiness.  It's a good thing to use if you are so stuffed up that you can't even get nasal spray up you nostril.  Clear your congestion temporarily with this and THEN apply nasal spray.
 Make sure you keep the cap screwed on tightly and keep the inhalor out of the heat.  Don't leave in you car where it can heat up. If it's heated up drastically, it can cause irritation since the vapors will be stronger.   Just like a nasal spray, you should not use this for more than a few days.
 A good product that can help you out when others don't work.  A nice alternative to oral decongestants.

What a great little design that fits into your pocket just like a chapstick. No matter how stuffy I get, those Vicks vapors clear me right up allowing me to use my nasal spray to keep the airways clear. There are two things you should definitely avoid with this product. First, you should not over use the inhaler, as it will cause nasal irritation. Second, you should store the inhaler at room temperature because if it gets too hot the vapors will be stronger and also cause nasal irritation. The only other concern is that this product has an ingredient that will show up as an amphetamine on a drug test. So, you should keep the card with you if your boss gives you a drug test. If you follow these guidelines, then you'll see this product is a real lifesaver when you're all stuffed up.

This product was easier to use and carry ..., April 8, 2000

This product was easier to use and carry with you than the typical nose spray, but I didn't feel the product worked as well. The stuffiness returned sooner than with the typical nose spray products. I'd buy it, since it's easy to carry and use.

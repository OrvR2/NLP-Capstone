         September 14, 2011 If you think a Republican President is going to make life better in America, think again. The GOP platform is one of profound austerity for everyone but the super rich. "The U.S. poverty rate remains among the highest in the developed world," according to MSNBC. "The rate would be even higher without a variety of government programs intended to blunt the impact of the worst recession since the 1930s." Monday night's Tea Party GOP presidential debate had candidates railing against Social Security, Medicare and other entitlement programs that would drastically change the American way of life. U.S. poverty rates are rising, even as Republicans push for funding cuts to safety net programs. The elimination of Social Security and Medicare would throw millions of people into desperate poverty and cause early death for those who cannot access medical care. Americans should consider how much worse off the country would be if there were no Democrats to stand between a forced Republican austerity plan that is nothing more than a thinly veiled disguise for a redistribution of wealth from the working class to the super rich. A trend is emerging in America, and it does not point to prosperity for the nation. Democracy is failing, in part, because of the legalization of election corruption through Citizens United vs. FEC. With control of all three legislative branches of government, the Tea Party Republicans can effectively shrink government down to a shell, and take the middle class along with it. Without a middle class, America has no economy.        1 of 11

You are right to cite the Citizens United case as a problem. The GOP seems to value corporate rights over human rights, and the Right-wing Noise Machine has indoctrinated so many people that they don't understand what is happening. Sad state of affairs, for sure.

The Citizens United decision was a game changer - as we saw in the 2010 elections. the T Party backers literally purchased the House of representatives. Now they are blocking progress in the economy, administration appointments, and show a complete disregard for the democratic process. They have been ignoring what the public wants and acting only on what their PAC contributors demand. i never thought democracy would end in my lifetime but it sure looks like its over.

You have to give the Republicans kudos for their marketing. They would not have garnered the votes to get them into these hallowed halls without a super sell job on the plebians.

These dangers are prevalent because the same thing has just happened in Great Britain. The British were dumb enough to vote David Cameron, the conservative, as Prime Minister. Since his election, he has implemented austerity packages in the UK, which was ultimately the root cause for all of the protests and riots this year.

You do understand that British Conservatives and US Conservatives are miles apart right? Cameron is more like Obama than any US Conservative...

Good article. The question that keeps popping up in my mind as I listen to the "one term president" wishes of key republicans is: "If they win the presidency, will they then decide that the ideas presented by Obama to help keep America afloat are good ideas? In that case will they then spin things so as to claim that Obama "never proposed these ideas?"

As the GOP has mastered distorted spin, I would have to say 'yes.'

Their idea of Paradise is a handful of super-rich in the "ruling-class" and the rest of us working for them to make their lives more comfortable while getting paid $1.25 an hour.

Itobin53,when you wrote,without middle class,america has no economy,obliged me if i am wrong,your "daring statement" actually is very subjective and relative,it's opened for public debate, i was electrified to know great super power nation like your country having the same problems with my country, poverty rate in your country is increasing, in malaysia,those income below RM700(USD 230) is "gazzetted" by goverment as a "fresh poor"and they are entitled for goverment welfare scheme,they are given free "money",monthly between RM 100 to RM 300.and think,obliged me,if am wrong, your goverment, "wastage a big money on military budget too much, Why should your goverment spend money on killing innocent people in Middle east, why should Barrack Obama,send US Marine on hot spot area? Can't we all live in peace ? would it be possible your politician mutually agreed to create THE LAND OF PARADISE IN THE EARTH, no more blood, no more bullet, no more "war", anyway what you wrote was true, your are the hero for American's poor,good work, honestly,let's get back to square one, let's get back to the phylosophy of simple live,what about your prophet,Jesus say,if "he were to see what going on in US",your prophet Jesus is the poorest prophet among the prophet written in Bible and Al-Quran and Hadith, Jesus everyday "nurture" fasting and fasting until his last breath, the bottom line of the story "fasting make humane life spritually strong, after all, life is very simple, we live, we work, we eat, we sleep and "when time come" to die, we die,simply,tq

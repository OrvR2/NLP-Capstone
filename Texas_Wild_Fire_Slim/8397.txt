Scots names experienced XV for World Cup openerBy DENNIS PASSA - AP Sports Writer | AP – 10 hrs ago





INVERCARGILL, New Zealand (AP) — Veteran Chris Paterson has been selected at fullback for Saturday's Pool B match against Romania, which will make him the first Scotland player to contest four World Cups.Already Scotland's most experienced international with 105 test caps, the utility back will be playing his 12th RWC match in a starting lineup containing eight players with World Cup experience."I guess it's all about goals, and playing in my fourth is certainly something that's right up there in my career," Paterson said. "I sure hope it's a better milestone than my 100th test, where I picked up an injury."Coach Andy Robinson announced his squad Thursday, including Ruaridh Jackson at flyhalf to rest Dan Parks and favoring Mike Blair at scrumhalf to Chris Cusiter. Both Parks and Cusiter were included on the reserves bench."We have picked a strong side," Robinson said. "There is competition for places and we could have easily picked another XV, as we did in the warmup games."The Scots have a quick turnaround, with their subsequent match against Georgia on Wednesday."We need to get a good start, but you have to take the players into consideration throughout," Robinson said. "Playing two matches in five days is something we don't do very often."Lock Alastair Kellock, who is making his first appearance at a World Cup at the age of 30, will lead a Scottish side which has changed considerably since its 23-12 win over Italy in a warmup match three weeks ago.He will lock down the second row with the 2.07-meter (6-foot-9) Richie Gray, who returns in the place of Nathan Hines.Hooker Ross Ford will play in his 50th test on Saturday, the 31st Scottish player to achieve that feat.In the backs, only Blair and wingers Simon Danielli and Max Evans kept their places from the side which started against Italy. Ross and those three backs also started Scotland's last World Cup match, a quarterfinal defeat to Argentina in 2007."As ever, our key objective this weekend is to win the game and thus get a foothold in the tournament," Robinson said. "We really respect Romania, who are a young side who are developing together."Paterson, who said his side is "anxious to get going here," also praised Romania."They are a strong side with lots of big ball carriers," Paterson said. "We have a lot of respect for them and expect a tough game."___Scotland team: Chris Paterson, Max Evans, Joe Ansbro, Sean Lamont, Simon Danielli, Ruaridh Jackson, Mike Blair; Allan Jacobsen, Ross Ford, Geoff Cross, Richie Gray, Alastair Kellock (captain), Kelly Brown, John Barclay, Richie Vernon. Replacements: Scott Lawson, Alasdair Dickinson, Nathan Hines, Ross Rennie, Chris Cusiter, Dan Parks, Rory Lamont.

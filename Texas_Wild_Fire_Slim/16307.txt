Almost every family experiences a car accident at some point, and it's important that you choose an insurance company that will work with you to solve any problems that you experience. There are various aspects to consider when shopping for car insurance, like:how much does it cost, is there a local agent to consult, what are the company policies when an accident occurs, are there incentives for safe driving, are there discounts for taking safety programs. And, after the AIG debacle, it's even more important to also consider the financial stability of the company.Give it a Try: Search for Listing in Your CityBusiness, restaurant, or servicesCity, State or Zip CodeState Farm® Official SiteSave Up To $480 On Car Insurance!

Hail damage can be extremely expensive to repair, and it's important to remember that without comprehensive auto coverage, your insurance company is unlikely to cover the cost.Featured States:New YorkNearly 270 insurers write automobile insurance in New York, accounting for more that $8 billion in annual premiums. Personal Injury Protection (PIP), liability, and Uninsured Motorist (UM) coverage are all required by the state. Premiums in New York are the fourth most expensive in the country, averaging $1083 per year in 2006. It's estimated that 5% of New York drivers were uninsured as of 2007, a great reason to make sure you have as much coverage as your budget will allow. For more information on New York auto insurance requirements, contact the New York State Insurance Department (http://ins.state.ny.us/...).HawaiiThe minimum amount of Personal Injury Protection coverage a driver in Hawaii must have is $10,000. That may not be enough to cover your expenses in the case of an accident with an uninsured driver, however, so consider paying a little more for better coverage. Some analysts estimate that as many as 20% of the state's drivers are uninsured.

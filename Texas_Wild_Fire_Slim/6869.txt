Woman killed in wreck near Franklin


Tweet


















  
A 54-year-old woman was killed and a Bryan man injured in a two-vehicle wreck in Robertson County over the weekend, according to Texas Department of Public Safety officials.
Franklin resident Sharon Dieckman was driving a four-door car on U.S. 79, two miles north of Franklin at about 5:30 p.m. Saturday when she swerved into the northbound shoulder to avoid hitting tire debris, overcorrected and traveled into the southbound lane, authorities said. That's when she hit a truck, according to the DPS.
The driver of the truck, Ronald Rust, 61, of Bryan, was taken to St. Joseph Regional Health Center in Bryan with injuries to a knee and ankle, the DPS report states.
Both were reported to have been wearing their seat-belts.
Dieckman's body was taken to McCauley Funeral Home in Franklin.

June 20, 2011 – GRIMES COUNTY, Texas – At least 26 homes were destroyed in the Dyer Mill Fire in Grimes County on Sunday, bringing the total of homes and buildings destroyed by wildfire to nearly 2,000 across the state since fire season began Nov. 15. As the unprecedented drought conditions continue, Texas Forest Service is encouraging Texans to help prevent wildfires by avoiding outdoor activities that can cause a spark. More than 90 percent of wildfires are caused by humans. Seemingly harmless things like outdoor grilling, dragging safety chains behind a trailer, welding and building campfires can become deadly in an instant. “There is high probability of a wildfire breaking out if a spark occurs,” said Justice Jones, prevention coordinator for Texas Forest Service. “We’re seeing critical weather conditions and high winds that are causing these wildfires to spread rapidly. Firefighters need the support of Texans to prevent new fire starts during this extremely hot and dry summer.” Families can use Texas Forest Service resources to protect your property from wildfire and create a wildfire action plan for their homes.  Contacts:Justice Jones, Prevention Coordinator936-546-8042, jjones@tfs.tamu.edu April Saginor, Communications Specialist979-458-6606, asaginor@tfs.tamu.eduTexas Forest Service communications staff can be reached after hours at newsmedia@tfs.tamu.edu.

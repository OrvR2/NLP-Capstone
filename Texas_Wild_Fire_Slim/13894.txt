12-11-2007 Lusaka airport, Zambia Panic gripped on lookers and passengers at the Lusaka International airport when a South African airways passenger plane hit into a stationary truck upon arrival from Johannesburg. A ZANIS crew that rushed to scene around 15:00 hours found airport officials and fire service personnel and South African Airways officials inspecting the Boeing 737-700 registration number ZS-SJD. Uncompromising Airport and Zambia Police Officers could not however allow the crew access to the accident site as management had instructed them not to allow the press. According to an eye witness who refused to be identified, the plane was about to park at the apron before passengers could disembark when its left wing that was dented, hit into the stationary utility truck registration number KYZ 207. Efforts to get a comment from South African Airways officials also proved futile as they categorically refused to comment on the matter. The lady official who was found at the airlines office told the crew that the airline does not give information to the press on such matters and referred the news crew back to the airport officials. No casualties were recorded and both airport and airline officials further refused to state the number of passengers on board citing security reasons. This has been the airline policy since the September 11th attack in the United States when two planes were hijacked by suspected Al-Quaeda terrorists hit into the twin towers at the world <b>...</b>

AIRPORT CAMERA VIDEO Cargo plane crashes, bursts into flames at Narita Airport A FEDEX cargo plane en route from China crashed in strong winds and exploded in a ball of flames on Monday at Tokyo's Narita airport, killing both pilots. The pair, said to be US citizens, were reportedly the only two people aboard the McDonnell Douglas MD-11, which was flying in from Guangzhou in southern China. Television footage showed the three-engine wide-body plane tip sideways shortly after touch-down in strong winds and then, as one of its wings clipped the ground at high speed, burst into a fireball. "We confirm the deaths of the two pilots," Katsuji Komiyama, an official at Narita Red Cross hospital told AFP. Fire engines and scores of fire-fighters in silver suits rushed to the crash site and doused the fire with foam as the gutted aircraft lay upside down billowing black smoke. The crash, which happened at about 6.50am (0850 AEDT), closed down one of Narita's two runways, airport officials said. The two pilots were reported to be US citizens by public broadcaster NHK.

The following was an article written by Jonathan Maus on bikeportland.org on April 3, 2008. Jonathan is the owner and editor of bikeportland.org. An exhibition of bicycles handmade in Oregon debuted at the Portland Airport today. The exhibit — which I brought you the details of back in February — is slated to run for six months and airport officials say an estimated 3.3 million passengers will pass by the 40-foot, glass display case. Since the exhibit is located beyond security gates, only ticketed passengers can view it. I joined a video crew today that was working on a project for the Portland Development Commission (a partner in the exhibit) to gain access and snap some photos (my slideshow is below). I was full of Oregon pride as I walked up to the display. Passersby peered into the glass, studying the placards that described each of the ten bikes in the exhibit. One guy was so excited by what he saw, he chased down the rest of his group, and dragged them back to show them what he'd found (they were amazed at the 16.75 pound hardwood bike by Renovo). The photo didn't come out, but a nice statement about the exhibit was written in stickers on the glass. It said: Combining engineering skills, precious metal craftsmanship, cutting edge design, and a passion for cycling, these Oregon bike builders create functional works of art that appeal to today's rider. The ten examples shown here represent only a few of the builders working in Oregon, but they share a common goal of <b>...</b>

The airport must hold the emergency response drill every three years to satisfy Federal Aviation Administration regulations. Morristown Airport is owned by the town and operated by DM Airport LTD. It is the second most active general aviation in the state behind Teterboro Airport. The drill simulated the crash of a Dornier 328 jet, including the flaming wreck and burned victims scattered around the tarmac. (me) In that scenario, the Dornier jet, carrying 32 passengers and three crew members, hit a flock of birds just after take-off, causing an engine to break apart.

Hospital staff are caring for a newborn baby after cleaners found him stuffed into a bin on board a plane in the Philippines. Cleaners found the baby boy inside a rubbish bin in the toilet of a Gulf Air flight that arrived from Bahrain on Sunday, the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) said. The boy was covered with blood and wrapped in tissue paper when found. Staff said blood stains were also found on two seats in the plane. An airport medical team cleaned up the newborn, then rushed him to a hospital. He is in good condition, said an official of the Department of Social Welfare and Development, who has taken custody of the child. Radio stations were swamped with calls offering adoption of the baby, but the welfare department said they are giving the mother a chance to come forward. The boy weighs 3 kilograms, and measured 48 centimetres. Airport officials have reportedly christened the baby boy George Francis, short for GF which refers to Gulf Air's code. MIAA general manager Angel Hongrado said they will conduct an investigation and find out who the baby's mother is, and why he was abandoned. Immigration authorities said they did not see or notice any female passenger looking sick or in pain.

A Kingfisher Airlines ATR-72 aircraft skidded off the runway Tuesday evening while landing at Mumbai airport, officials said. All 42 passengers and crew onboard were safe. Flight IT-4124 arrived from Bhavnagar and landed at Mumbai airport which had been witnessing low visibility due to rains and cloudy skies since early Tuesday morning. Being a Tuesday, only half the main runway was being used and only smaller aircraft were allowed to operate between 12-6 pm, as announced last month by the airport authorities. A spokesman for Kingfisher Airlines said that the cause of the incident is not yet known. He also denied that a fire broke out in the aircraft due to the skidding. A few flights scheduled for departure Tuesday evening were delayed because of the incident.

The CIA's Secret Sites in Somalia Nestled in a back corner of Mogadishu's Aden Adde International Airport is a sprawling walled compound run by the Central Intelligence Agency. Set on the coast of the Indian Ocean, the facility looks like a small gated community, with more than a dozen buildings behind large protective walls and secured by guard towers at each of its four corners. Adjacent to the compound are eight large metal hangars, and the CIA has its own aircraft at the airport. The site, which airport officials and Somali intelligence sources say was completed four months ago, is guarded by Somali soldiers, but the Americans control access. At the facility, the CIA runs a counterterrorism training program for Somali intelligence agents and operatives aimed at building an indigenous strike force capable of snatch operations and targeted "combat" operations against members of Al Shabab, an Islamic militant group with close ties to Al Qaeda. As part of its expanding counterterrorism program in Somalia, the CIA also uses a secret prison buried in the basement of Somalia's National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters, where prisoners suspected of being Shabab members or of having links to the group are held. Some of the prisoners have been snatched off the streets of Kenya and rendered by plane to Mogadishu. While the underground prison is officially run by the Somali NSA, US intelligence personnel pay the salaries of intelligence agents and also directly interrogate <b>...</b>

Shahrukh Khan says stopped at US airport By Pratap Chakravarty (AFP) 5 hours ago NEW DELHI — Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan said he was detained for questioning Saturday at a US airport because he has a Muslim name. Khan, known as the "King of Bollywood," said he was questioned at Newark Airport in Newark, New Jersey, for two hours but was let go after the Indian embassy in the United States intervened. Khan "is a Muslim name and I think the name is common on their checklist," the 43-year-old actor told an Indian television station by telephone from Chicago. Khan, named as one of the top 50 most influential men in the world in 2008 by US magazine Newsweek, was detained by US immigration officers early Saturday. The officers wanted to know why the actor was visiting the United States after his name popped up on the computer screen at a counter. "I was waiting for my bags... I thought it was nice of them to take me to another room... but that was apparently a second check," Khan said, adding, "I had my papers in order." "I was really taken aback," Khan told CNN-IBN television station. "I did not want to say anything just in case they took everything wrong because I am little worried about Americans because they do have this issue when your name is Muslim." US airport officials are frequently accused by human rights groups of racially profiling Muslims. The actor, who was heading to Chicago to take part in celebrations Saturday to mark India's Independence Day, said the <b>...</b>

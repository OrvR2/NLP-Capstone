This is an amazing store.  The pictures don't do the size and scope of it justice.  Wish the US had more of an appetite for such design.  Thanks for the article and pics.  Great reminder.  Jon Eborn

Here is Similar Story

Apple Stores are almost always a center of attraction for all ages. Mostly because it allows you to experience some of the coolest gadgets on earth, also partly because the store itself is attractive in design. And now Apple takes the bar even higher. The spectacular Apple Opéra Store you see above is the newest place were all Apple fans in Paris can hang out. Located near the popular Opera de Paris, the store was originally a local bank which underwent a significant renovation.

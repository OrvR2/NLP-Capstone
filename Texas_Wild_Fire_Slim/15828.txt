TEEX instructor Chris Gallagher (left) and Texas Task Force 1 members Denise Corliss, with her canine partner Britagne, and Bob McKee recall the response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. McKee was working in Ohio at the time and went with his state team. Bud Force (far right) joined TTF1 in 2005 and recently published a book about the agency.

Texas Task Force 1 honored




  
The smell of raw jet fuel and saturated concrete powder cloak the memories that trigger sleepless nights almost 10 years later for a now-retired New York police detective.
For Chris Gallagher and others who responded to the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center towers, memories of the aftermath of the tragedy will stay with them for the rest of their lives.
A fourth-generation New York City police detective, Gallagher left the force in 2008 and is now an instructor at Texas Engineering Extension Service in College Station.
But on Sept. 11 he ran logistics for NYPD at two locations at Ground Zero, one that he commanded by radio.
Gallagher had worked for nine years in the department's Emergency Service Unit in tactical operations, rescue services and protection of high-risk dignitaries, so he was used to improvising and dealing with circumstances that bordered on being out-of-control.
But Sept. 11 was something different.
"I think what happens is your mind disconnects from your body, and that's to protect your mental state," Gallagher said. "You almost operate like a robot. You've known what to do for years and years being in law enforcement. You've dealt with a multitude of victims, suicide and homicides and being in the unit I was in, you had jumpers and people struck by subway trains. You were used to it already. But in that magnitude it was kind of like a sensory overload. You just couldn't observe what was going on very quickly."
At the time, Gallagher was on loan to the NYC Office of Emergency Management as citywide interagency coordinator.
"That morning I was fabricating a prop for training when the other officers that I worked with came out and said, 'Hey a plane hit the Trade Center,'" he recalled. "From that point it just went downhill."
Accurate information was hard to come by, Gallagher said, because radio frequencies were jammed, so coordinators turned on the TV to see what was happening. Gallagher said the team was coming over the bridge into Manhattan when the south tower collapsed. It took some time to work through the chaos, but the they moved swiftly to create a command post. 
"My wife didn't know whether I was dead or alive for 24 hours," he said.
He spent eight months working six days a week at the site.
One of his colleagues retired the same year that Gallagher did, but two years later discovered he had cancer caused, he believed, by exposure from the collapse of the towers. The disease developed in his lungs, brain and liver.
He passed away a month ago.
"It always has that little bird chirping on my shoulder," Gallagher said. "What's going to come knocking at my door? You don't know. Did he do anything different? Is his body different? You just don't know."
New colors
Bob McKee, director of disaster preparedness and response TEEX Texas Task Force 1, said he was working for the task force in Ohio at the time of the collapse. McKee said a friend called to tell him to turn on the TV.
Minutes later, McKee was paged by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He was to gather task force members and get to New York City immediately. 
"You just had disbelief. You had to think this was an accident, then live in front of me I saw the second plane come in and hit the tower," he said.
He said he was asked to move task force members into New York from across the country in cargo planes. Partnering with the Air Force, McKee said, they brought in personnel as well as several hundred thousands pounds of equipment in C-141s. Arriving at ground zero, McKee said, the area was bustling and covered in pulverized debris.
"Surreal is an understatement," he said. "To see the damage, the impact, and if you will, the shock that most people had about themselves."
For just under six weeks McKee worked around the area helping coordinating efforts.
"The color of smoke, the color of some of the products that were obviously burning deep in the pile ... and I remember thinking you know, there are some colors here I've never seen before."
'I've got to go'
It wasn't until leaving the wreckage in New York City that the emotions poured forward, said Denise Corliss, a volunteer firefighter with Texas Task Force 1. She said there were a lot of people asking what she saw and what it was like upon returning to Houston.
"For a period of time, I just wasn't ready to discuss that," she said. "When we're at the site, we're focused on the job. I'm not really processing all the emotions and all the scenes."
Each anniversary of the attack on the nation stirs the memories of working those 10- and 12-hour days.
"When it starts getting close to 9/11, a few days before, I can start feeling that I'm just not myself," she said. "Maybe a little more anxious or irritable, and I'll look and see it's close to time again."
It was her first deployment as part of the task force. 
But she had someone who carried her through the work: Bretagne.
Corliss said she selected Bretagne, a golden retriever, as a puppy and trained the canine for disaster search-and-rescue. She said she was outside training Bretagne when her husband brought her inside after reports a tower had been hit.
"When the towers fell I was on the phone with my mother. I remember saying, 'Mom I've got to go, the task force is going to call.'"
And it did. 
Corliss said she grabbed her gear, dog food and Bretagne and they drove to College Station to join the team, which would fly to New York City.
"I was more focused at that point at being prepared and getting out the door and really wanting to get there as quick as I can," she said. "I wasn't thinking about the what-ifs."
Each day consisted of breakfast, a briefing, 12 hours of searching through the ruble for survivors or bodies, a decontamination for her and Bretagne, a debriefing, dinner and then hopefully a few hours of sleep. 
Throughout the ordeal, she said, Bretagne was calm, focused and prepared.
Being perfect
While emergency response coordination has improved since the attacks, Gallagher thinks the United States is at risk of becoming complacent. 
"We have to be perfect all the time," he said. "They only have to be perfect once."

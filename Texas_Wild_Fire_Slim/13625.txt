A jumbo jet made repeated drops of 12,000 gallons of fire retardant Friday in hopes of slowing a tenacious wildfire north of Houston that had expanded overnight from 12,600 acres to 22,000 acres, the Texas Forest Service said.
The DC-10 tanker - assigned to Bastrop County in Central Texas, where the state's worst fire in history had devoured 34,000 acres - was diverted to attack the "particularly aggressive fire" burning across Montgomery, Grimes and Waller counties, said Carman Apple, Texas Forest Service spokeswoman.
The blaze is spreading so rapidly that it has tripled in size in just the last two days, reports show, and is the third-largest of the 95 active fires in the state.
"This fire is now the highest priority due to the expansion and the structures being threatened," said Ralph Collum, another agency spokesman.
As dusk approached Friday, the wildfire stood only 30 percent contained, disappointing given that containment had reached 85 percent shortly after the fire started on Labor Day, authorities said.
"But containment never means the fire is out," explained Apple. "It just means that there is a barrier keeping it from spreading and firefighters are able to enter the area and put out smaller smoldering fires that might respark."
In these record dry conditions, however, barriers are easily breached when a spark is blown into a new area and ignites the tinder-dry landscape, she said.
Waller County Commissioner Stan Kitzman praised the firefighters who are in the trenches, especially the volunteers.
"They're not getting paid and some have employers giving them a hard time for being here," Kitzman noted. "But our state couldn't exist without them."
One group of firefighters was positioned near the Pct. 2 Justice of the Peace office in western Waller County on Friday afternoon. Outside at a roadblock, dozens of residents had parked their pickups and cars under large trees, hoping county officials would let them at least have a quick peek at properties they had been ordered to leave on Monday.
In a few minutes, it became clear why authorities had closed the road.
Less than a mile away, the winds had fanned tall flames in the thick treeline along both shoulders of FM 1488, the scene of earlier battles with a tenacious fire that has leapt to life repeatedly since Monday.
On the south side of the farm-to-market road, firefighters clustered in small groups where they had parked their brush trucks, advancing on foot into the burning woods as far as their fire hoses would stretch. Two larger, distinctive red fire engines waited on the shoulder.
The road was splotched reddish-orange in sections, the residue of fire retardant dropped from airborne tankers deployed in the fight.
In one spot, a firefighter in a yellow jumpsuit was spraying a downed tree with water where it lay next to the pavement. A few yards away, another was tamping down the flames with a broom.
Next to them, a Texas Department of Transportation dump truck towing a trailer had stopped to off-load a bulldozer. As the flames were beat down, the dozer driver was ready to carve out a fire lane to protect dozens of houses on nearby Rice Road, a long curving route dotted with homesteads in the path of the fire.
Officials on Friday had to tell the evacuees to be patient, that the danger of fire was too close to allow them to return home.
Most people have been cooperative, said Fred Edwards, a Waller County assistant district attorney who was spending his day off helping answer residents' questions.
"They have been concerned about their pets, but they understand most of the people working out here are volunteers," Edwards said. "They are mostly just neighbors."
In Bastrop, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, acting as governor while Rick Perry is on the campaign trail, faced angry shouts and frustrated questions Friday from residents demanding to know why federal assistance hasn't arrived and whether the National Guard had been called to thwart possible looters.
Dewhurst told the crowd, jammed into the Bastrop convention center for a news conference, that he'd just signed a second letter to President Barack Obama requesting that he declare Texas a major disaster area.

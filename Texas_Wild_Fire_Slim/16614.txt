In a business that is forever changing, Julian Mayes and Karlton “Kuzo” Lockridge are emerging as two of the hottest underground producers in Tennessee. It all started from a simple hobby in High School of “making beats” which is now a passion for composing music. Julian Mayes and Karlton “Kuzo” Lockridge have never limited themselves to hip-hop/R &B; they have experimented with Rock, Neo-Soul, and even Reggaeton music. When asked what motivates Julian Mayes and Karlton “Kuzo” Lockridge to produce music Julian Mayes replied “My Faith and family that’s sums it up right? Naw just kidding, you hear the same type of music everyday right but our music is not predictable its memorable. Karlton “Kuzo” Lockridge said “My family motivates me, also, being able to get emotions out of people whether it’s good or bad. It’s just motivating to reach out to people and touch their lives with our music.

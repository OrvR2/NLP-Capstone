Grand Strand tourism to bounce back for Labor DayAP – Thu, Sep 1, 2011





MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) — Labor Day weekend tourism along South Carolina's Grand Strand is expected to bounce back strongly after last weekend's brush with Hurricane Irene.Researchers at Coastal Carolina University estimate that occupancy in Horry and Georgetown counties will be over 80 percent Friday night. On Saturday and Sunday nights, occupancy is projected to be closer to 90 percent.The forecast calls for fair weather through the holiday weekend along the state's north coast.Last weekend occupancy was only about 44 percent as Hurricane Irene approached. That was down more than 25 percent from the same weekend a year ago.The Grand Strand is the heart of South Carolina's $14 billion tourism industry.

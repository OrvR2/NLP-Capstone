Finally, we will hear words coming out of Chris Tucker's mouth (and, presumably, understand them).
The enigmatic "Rush Hour" star is in talks to join two new high profile films, Variety reports. First, the trade paper reports that he's looking at joining "The Silver Linings Playbook," the David O. Russell-directed pic about a man who suffers a break down, is institutionalized, and then heads back home to try and pick up the pieces. 
Originally, Mark Wahlberg was attached to the film, which would have re-teamed with his "The Fighter" director, but he had to drop out due to other commitments. Now, Bradley Cooper will play lead, with Jennifer Lawrence serving as his younger love interest.
Tucker is also potentially joining "Neighborhood Watch," a suburban comedy that has a mighty trio of Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill.
A successful comedian, Tucker hasn't been in a film since 2007's "Rush Hour 3," and hasn't featured in a movie outside of that franchise since the 1997 trio of "The Fifth Element," "Jackie Brown," and "Money Talks." He also recently went on a standup tour.

				I thought Dave Chappelle went nuts and ran off to Africa because he couldn't handle the fact that white people laughed at his jokes. So until they can absolutely prohibit Caucasians from seeing his stuff, he probably won't be making any. Which reminds me of a Dave Chappelle skit, really.

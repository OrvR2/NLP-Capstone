StoryText SizeTrooper Faces Drug Smuggling ChargesTSA Agents, Police Officers Also Charged In Major Drug Ring BustPOSTED: Tuesday, September 13, 2011UPDATED: 6:24 am EDT September 14, 2011 OCALA, Fla. -- Federal prosecutors in Connecticut say a state trooper, a police officer and three Transportation Security Administration officers based at airports have been arrested on charges of participating in a conspiracy to distribute tens of thousands of highly addictive painkiller pills.Authorities say the TSA officers, based at airports in Florida and New York, a Westchester County, N.Y., police officer and a Florida state trooper received cash payments to help transport oxycodone pills from Florida to New York and Connecticut and/or transport cash proceeds from the sale of the drugs back to Florida.Local 6 has learned 28-year-old Justin Kolves, a K-9 FHP trooper in Ocala was among over a dozen people arrested in the bust.Local 6 was there Tuesday as investigators searched the Lake County home of Kolves and his fiancee, 28-year-old Jessica Douglas.The local couple was arrested on charges of conspiring to illegally sell tens of thousands of Oxycodone painkillers from Florida to Connecticut.According to court documents an informant paid off Kolves by giving Douglas checks in exchange for protection for distributors transporting pills or currency driving through Central Florida."I'm shocked. I would have never thought it. Never," Cheryl Velazquez said Tuesday.Once relieved to hear a trooper was moving into their neighborhood, neighbors said they were unaware the man they trusted is now accused of being a criminal."It's a good feeling having that cop car on your street having that security just a couple doors down. But I guess you just never know," Velazquez said.If convicted, those arrested could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million.

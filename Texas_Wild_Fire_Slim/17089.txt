Oklahoma is No. 1 in AP poll for 100th time




        By RALPH D. RUSSO, AP College Football Writer
        Sep 11, 2:59 pm EDT

















NEW YORK (AP)—For the 100th time, Oklahoma is No. 1.
The Sooners reached a milestone in the history of The Associated Press
college football poll without even playing. Oklahoma became the first team to
hold the top ranking 100 times since the poll began 1936.


The Sooners will bring that No. 1 ranking into one of the biggest
nonconference games of the season when they face No. 5 Florida State in
Tallahassee on Saturday.
Oklahoma received 32 first-place votes and 1,441 points from the media
panel.
Alabama reclaimed the No. 2 spot after a 27-11 victory at Penn State,
flip-flopping with No. 3 LSU. Last week, the Tigers jumped the Crimson Tide.
Boise State is No. 4.
Alabama received nine-first-place votes, LSU had 17 and Boise State had two.
The Sooners have been ranked No. 1 in all three polls this season, including
their 10th appearance as No. 1 in the preseason, another record.
Notre Dame is second to OU with 95 overall appearances as the No. 1 team in
the AP poll. Ohio State is next at 94 and Southern California has been No. 1 90
times.
Defending national champion Auburn moved back into the rankings at No. 21
after one of the wildest wins from one of the wildest days in college football
in recent memory.
The Tigers needed a last-second goal line stand to beat Mississippi State
41-34, a week after scoring two touchdowns in the final two minutes to defeat
Utah State. Auburn has the nation’s longest winning streak at 17 games.
Also moving into the rankings this week was No. 22 Arizona State, which beat
Missouri 37-30 in overtime on Friday.
Missouri and Penn State fell out of the Top 25.
The rest of the top 10 had Stanford at No. 6, followed by Wisconsin,
Oklahoma State, Texas A&M and Nebraska.
No. 11 South Carolina moved up a spot after beating Georgia 45-42 on the
strength of three nonoffensive touchdowns.
Oregon was No. 12, with Virginia Tech at 13, Arkansas 14 and Michigan State
15.
No. 16 Florida, Ohio State, West Virginia, Baylor and South Florida round
out the top 20.
Joining Auburn and Arizona State in the final five were No. 23 TCU, No. 24
Texas and No. 25 Mississippi State, which fell nine spots.

0 users disliked this comment Lonnie  1 minute ago Report Abuse I read a post from a couple of hours ago, voted down for the arrogance I guess, but it is the truth.   THE SEC WILL SINGLE-HANDEDLY LEAD US TO A PLAYOFF.   That's right on.

The NYC/Big 10 media succeeded for years in keeping their "boys" at the top of the rankings, and the Pac 12 and Big 10 FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL AGAINST A PLAYOFF.   The prestige of the Rose Bowl was all that mattered to them.

Well, their clout is gone, outta here.   They will be forced to accept it out of DESPERATION.   THANK YOU SEC.

0 users disliked this comment jaguar 2 minutes ago Report Abuse Little early to be ranking teams before they play evenly matched schools.   Ohio State played Akron, then struggled against Toledo and now play Miami, one example of why these early polls are meaningless.

0 users disliked this comment Pam 3 minutes ago Report Abuse They always like to put a team other than an SEC team at number 1 to start the season, this is the only way another conference has a chance at this top spot.   LSU is the best team in the nation and if the SEC didn't beat each other up all year they would play for all the major bowls.   At least those that aren't reserved for those other conferences because without a reservation they couldn't get the ratings to get there.

1 users disliked this comment Saul 13 minutes ago Report Abuse Now that the Garrett Gilbert experiment is over (hopefully), Texas looks to be on it's way back. BYU is a very good team and I would be surprises if they (BYU) lose again. Just ask Ole' Miss......! Texas defense is pretty incredible. The offense is ok with Ash and Colt McCoy's younger brother. Jaxon Shipley is pretty good as was and is his older brother playing the in NFL. Malcolm is showing why he was a five star running back. Hook em'!

1 users disliked this comment REALLY 21 minutes ago Report Abuse It was not pretty, but a win at Georgia was an accomplishment.   All the respect for Richt!   Great person.   Im obviously a Carolina fan, but have lost respect for Spurrier and his ability to coach this team on and off the field.   Garcia is an embarrassment to our school.

4 users disliked this comment Lula 34 minutes ago Report Abuse You know what You guys should stop complaining because, one the health care we have now isnt as good as it was supposed to be. also the law has just been signed so give it some time. so if u want to say u have the right to choose tell that to ur congress men or state official. If you do not have insurance and need one You can find full medical coverage at the lowest price by searching online for "Penny Health" If you have health insurance and do not care about cost just be happy it and trust me you are not going to loose anything!

3 users disliked this comment David R 48 minutes ago Report Abuse College football has become pointless. Until they have a playoff system this will always be a joke. These fat guys sitting behind a desk somewhere are the ones that put these teams in a national title game, not the teams themselve. They put a team in the number 1 spot that didn't even play a game and at the same time drop a team in the standings for winning. What a joke. I'm a Florida fan but when OKlahoma faces the only tem they will play this year, they will loose. Big 12, what a joke, easiest conference in football.....

9 users disliked this comment Liberal Media Sux 59 minutes ago Report Abuse Ohio State, Michigan,Notre Dame, Miami, and USC are now footnotes in history.   But their significance in the college world are no more.   For that matter, everyone outside the SEC is second tier now.   You can look for that multi level playoff in the near future in order to TRY an get another winner.   But you are all done for a while.Comment hidden due to low rating.  Show Comment

The SEC is the premier league and WILL win the sixth national championship in a row this year.   Then, the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth, and then they will change the BCS and be forced to come up with a 16 team playoff in order to TRY and get another winner in there.Comment hidden due to low rating.

4 users disliked this comment The REF!  1 hour ago Report Abuse Georgia gave three, maybe four TD's to So. Carolina in their mistake prone game--not sure So. Carolina should rise in the polls--buyt they will be taken care of proper by Florida, LSU, Arkansas, Miss. State, Alabama. SEC will be up and down all year--but roll Tide will win and LSU be the also ran, again.

The People there were amazing the nicest most polite I have been around. Even after they beat us they were still   respectful and polite.   Thanks for a big helping of hospitality.   Go LSU   I look forward to going back.   Buckeye Fan

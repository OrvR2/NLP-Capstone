This was made as a sort of request buy some one that used to live in the area and has since moved away. Unfortunately I was not able to get to their old stomping grounds because the roads were blocked off. So this is the best I could do.Basically the drive in from Houston via 290, beltway 8, 249/Tomball parkway, FM 1774, FM 1488...Music by Kevin MacLeod

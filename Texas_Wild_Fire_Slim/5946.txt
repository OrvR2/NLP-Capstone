Firefighters gain some control over deadly Texas blazeBy Karen Brooks | Reuters – 6 hrs ago

BASTROP, Texas (Reuters) - Firefighters gained ground for the first time on Wednesday against a deadly wildfire raging near Austin that has destroyed more homes than any other blaze in Texas history, officials said.
The 34,356-acre Bastrop County Complex fire, which has forced the evacuation of 5,000 people, was about 30 percent contained. The fire has claimed 785 homes, the Texas Forest Service reported, and killed two people.
County officials have given a lower number for homes destroyed. Fire service officials said they were not sure why there was a discrepancy but that assessments were continuing.
Firefighters who have fought the blaze, which stretches 24 miles long and 20 miles wide at its thickest point, since Sunday have been helped in the last two days by decreased winds and cooler temperatures, officials said.
All of that is cold comfort to William Clements. He learned Tuesday that his home in Bastrop was lost. "It was kind of a shock when we came up and saw that it was gone," he said. "But we are recovering from the shock, and landing on our feet."
Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst, visiting the command center as Governor Rick Perry was in California preparing for his first Republican presidential debate, said he would ask the federal government to declare the state a disaster area.
Wildfires sweeping across drought-stricken Texas have destroyed more than 1,000 homes and forced thousands of evacuations in the last several days.
More than 3.6 million acres in Texas have been scorched by wildfires since November, fed by a continuing drought that has caused more than $5 billion in damage to the state's agricultural industry and that shows no sign of easing.
A list of 243 homes confirmed destroyed was posted for Bastrop residents to check at the county's shelters and in a command center, but it only accounted for a fraction of the houses officials say have been burned.
Resident Geary Garton, his arms covered with bandages and his nose and ears blistered, was cheerily hopeful as he approached the list looking for his house.
RESIDENTS CHECK LIST
Garton said he'd left his home on foot to find a hose on Sunday night when the fires were coming. When he turned back to douse his home with water, fire was blocking him.
"It didn't look all that bad at first, but it came up quick," he said, adding that he had sprinted back through blinding smoke to reach his two dogs, the heat blistering his arms as he ran.
His dogs, Berkley and Clancy, were hiding under the porch, which was untouched by flames. But Garton was too weak to pick them up and had to leave them behind. He expressed hope that they had escaped and would turn up at a shelter.
Then he turned his attention to the list, reading the street names. When he got to K C Drive he stopped talking. He whipped off his glasses, turned on his heel, and wiped his eye as he strode away into the parking lot. He didn't answer questions about whether his home had survived.
The U.S. Forest Service has sent a team to the area to help coordinate, and Federal Emergency Management Agency officials were on the ground assessing the damages.
Also assisting were about 100 members of Texas Task Force 1, an elite wide-area search team that will be combing "every inch" of the enormous fire zone, said Mike Fisher, the county's emergency management coordinator.
"Essentially, the mission is to find whatever's out there that we need to deal with," he said. "If we have environmental hazards out there, ecohazards out there, dead animals."
The team was used in New York City after the September 11, 2001, attacks and after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
A DC-10 air tanker capable of carrying 12,000 gallons of retardant to drop onto the flames -- four times the normal capacity for retardant bombers -- landed in Austin on Tuesday and will fly on Friday after a federally mandated break.
It had not yet been determined whether the DC-10 would be used in Bastrop or sent to other sites in Texas.
So far, four people have died in the Labor Day weekend fires, including a mother and infant daughter who died in northeast Texas on Sunday.
Officials identified one of the two dead from the Bastrop fire as Michael Troy Farr, a 48-year-old City of Austin employee found dead in his home in Smithville. Officials released no details on how he died or information on the second victim, found several miles away.

To a certain extent Texas' lack of regulation... much like the lack of regulation needed during the financial crisis, has come back to bite them in the butt.  Cowboy's see in straight lines and black and white...  wish it were that simple but it just ain't.

Texas will survive and rebuild better than before, much to the regret of the low-bred liberals who wish them ill.

God bless Texas! So it seems that most of the ANTI- Texas postings on here, want to condemn the state of Texas for being thought of as a 'CHRIST-IAN' state.. HMMMM.... that just makes me THAT much more proud of my home state!  These haters are building up more strength, confidence and unity for the Texans.. the very thing they are showing that they are soooo jealous of! STAND STRONG TEXANS!

For you 'normal folk', notice the anti-Perry group?  Some are stationed in Israel, paid shills, and from US foreign aid.

Has anyone else noted the absence of the big aircraft that dump water on these fires ?
If your curious, it's because the company got a call "earlier" this year from the Feds cancelling their contract.... So tell me more about the Governor who doesn't care...

Okay people, make a note.  I believe there is a God and I believe he does work to shape our lives.  He does that not by affecting people but our environment.  So here it is.  A blasphemer (Perry) prayed to God for rain yet lives steep in selfishness and the other six sins.  he got fire instead.  Left at that you can say anything.  So here's what is next.  Rain.  Starting in the later part of 2010 around mid November for about six months there will enough rain to wash away the soil.  There will be floods to wash around the ground.  Lives may be lost but property will be.  

So write this down.  It was told to me and it WILL come to pass.  God is NOT mysterious.  If you won't listen then you won't know.

It is good to see the firefighters are making progress.  Having not experienced this kind of tragedy in my life, I don't know exactly what to say.  
May each of those who are involved in this and who are fighting to get these fires out know that my heart is reaching out to you.  Stay strong and know I am praying for you all.

Good to see some well wishing from the grown ups for Texas. Makes no sense to wish ill, no one here did anything personal to those slinging mud.

Re: Perry and the "Prayer for water",...grow up, people. If you tell your mom "Have a good day" and she gets raped that day, do you want someone telling you "How's that 'good day' workin out for ya, chief"?  Don't be an a-hole.  That said, I hope your mom doesn't get raped, alright?  

I may be a Texan (not native, regretably), I may be republican, but I'd help someone on the side of the road in Cali.  I may not like liberal politics, but when people are dealing with disaster, politics goes right out the window. I learned that in the military.  If you're slinging political feces during a hurricane in NJ or an earthquake in DC or Cali, or a fire here in TX, you're a tool.

We can feed foreigners in any other country 100000 MREs within 3 hours after given approval, but we have ONE DC-10 tanker "asset" under contract while hundreds of homes burn.

This, from a bloated, FAT government that just found $291 mil in Medicare fraud.  That would have put the fire out ... Hundreds of homes ago.

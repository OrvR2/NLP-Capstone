Sheriff: Gunman used AK-47 in IHOP shootingBy SANDRA CHEREB | AP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — A man with an AK-47 assault rifle shot an entire group of five uniformed National Guard members eating breakfast at a Nevada IHOP on Tuesday, killing two of them and another person in a hail of gunfire.The suspect, 32-year-old Eduardo Sencion of Carson City, also shot himself and later died at a hospital. Seven people were wounded in the attack at a strip mall near a casino and department store in the state's capital.The gunman's motive was unclear, but authorities are investigating whether the military members were targeted. The two Guardsmen killed were men; another woman also was shot and killed.Carson City Sheriff Kenny Furlong said Sencion entered the front doors of the IHOP and traveled "all the way through the restaurant to the back area" before opening fire."Obviously with five out of the 11 victims uniformed National Guardsmen, that has taken a priority interest in our investigation," Furlong said.Sencion worked at his family's business in South Lake Tahoe, he was not in the military, and he had no known affiliations with anyone at the restaurant, Furlong said. He also had no criminal history.Sencion's family raised concerns about his mental health in interviews with investigators, Furlong said. He did not elaborate.Sencion filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2009. His former lawyer in Carson City and Reno, Joe Laub, said he was surprised to learn Sencion was identified as the shooter.He called the shooting an "aberration of his character.""He's a gentle, kind man who was very helpful to friends and family," Laub told The Associated Press. "I couldn't venture to guess what would cause him to do something as horrible as this."The owner of a nearby barbecue restaurant described a frantic scene in which the gunman pulled up and immediately shot a man on a motorcycle, then charged into the IHOP, where the Guard members were meeting.Ralph Swagler said he grabbed his own weapon, but said it was too late to stop the shooter."I wish I had shot at him but he was going in the IHOP," said Swagler, who owns Locals BBQ & Grill. "But when he came at me, when somebody is pointing an automatic weapon at you — you can't believe the firepower, the kind of rounds coming out of that weapon."Nevada officials first worried about the violence being more widespread. They locked down the state Capitol and Supreme Court buildings for about 40 minutes, and put extra security in place at state and military buildings in northern Nevada."There were concerns at the onset, so we took certain steps to ensure we had the capability to embrace an even larger circumstance," Furlong said. "At this point in time it appears to be isolated to this parking lot."The IHOP is about four miles from the Guard's headquarters complex. Nevada National Guard spokeswoman April Conway said she didn't know why the five Guard members had met at the IHOP.At a Reno hospital, service members gathered, waiting for word on those killed and hurt. A hospital spokesman said four shooting victims were being treated there, but wouldn't discuss their conditions or provide any other information."You go a whole tour in Afghanistan and no one is shot. And you go to IHOP and several are shot," said 31-year-old Sgt. First Class Cameron Anderson of Reno, a Nevada Army National Guard member. "It's a shock. I came to work today and had no idea I'd be driving the chaplain here (to the hospital.)"Another Guard member, 33-year-old Spc. Lee Amato, said he didn't know the victims' names but expected they were people he knew."It's hard to believe something like this would happen to really good people," Amato said. "It's like a hole, something taken away. It's mind-boggling and hard to comprehend."At the scene of the attack, police interviewed dozens of witnesses and kept the gathering crowd of media at bay. A body lay on the ground, covered with a white sheet except for the feet, clad in tan boots.The gunman pulled up to the IHOP in a blue minivan around 9 a.m. in a minivan registered to his brother, Furlong said. Witnesses said he unloaded a clip before he got even 12 feet from his car.Fran Hunter, a regular customer at that IHOP, decided to eat breakfast across the street at a coffee shop inside the Casino Fandango."If you know the IHOP, they had to be sitting ducks with that long narrow aisle — if they were at those tables with no way to get out," said Hunter, who works at a pet supply store in the strip mall."Those people never stood a chance," Hunter told The Associated Press.Once he exited the restaurant, Furlong said the gunman got into a vehicle and drove around in circles. He fired shots toward the barbecue restaurant, shattering the windows, and at an H&R Block and a casino across the street.Officers responded to calls reporting the gunfire within minutes, Furlong said. The suspect was wounded and lying in the parking lot when they arrived at the scene, he said.The person who was shot on the motorcycle also was alive when officers arrived, and was transported to a hospital.Furlong says they're analyzing the weapon to determine whether it is automatic or semi-automatic.Nevada's capital city of some 50,000 is normally a sleepy town when lawmakers are not in session, a jumping off point 30 miles south of Reno for travelers headed to Lake Tahoe or back to California across the Sierra."I don't know what's happening to my city," Fran Hunter, who works at the Sierra Le Bone pet shop just north of the IHOP, told the Reno Gazette-Journal. "This happens in L.A. or Las Vegas but not here."___Associated Press writers Michelle Rindels, Ken Ritter and Oskar Garcia in Las Vegas; Martin Griffith in Reno; and Scott Sonner in Carson City contributed to this report.

"A man with an AK-47 assault rifle" and "Furlong says they're analyzing the weapon to determine whether it is automatic or semi-automatic" in the same article. So which is it? IS it an assault rifle or not, because a semi-automatic rifle is NOT an assault rifle. But hey, when you a re a chick working for AP your priorities are pumping up Obama and the liberal agenda anyway.

I know this slightly off topic, but I would be curious to know in what country this particular AK was manufactured in.  (these things are produced everywhere) If it turns out that one particular country is dumping these things, and putting them into the hands of criminals via the black market, then we need to take a look at things more closely.

This is why I have a CCW and I'm carrying my legally owned handgun when I go out. But I wonder if this IHOP had a policy against carrying a concealed weapon in their restaurant. If they did then it would have been against the law for me to carry my weapon in there  because I'm a law abiding citizen and would have left my weapon locked in my car.  But that only prevents me from protecting myself and family from such a situation as this because a crook or NUTCASE does not care about being law abiding.  They know they can do as much damage as they can before the police arrive and no one can stop them. Wait and see the news media are going to start screaming for stricter gun control because it was the evil gun that done this not the nutcase behind it.  My prayers go out to the family's that lost members to this senseless act of a deranged person.

Wasn't the ATF caught handing out guns to Mexican gangs by the thousands. I guess job security trumps everything these days.

Hard to believe they need a lab examination to determine auto or semi. Just look at the selector.

$10 says the liberals will blame this on the gun and suggest further gun controls.. when a fully automatic AK-47 requires a class 3 license, which I can #$%$ near guarantee you this guy didn't have.

"It was the idiot, not the gun". Really? Gosh, I wonder how it would have gone if he'd entered without a gun and attacked them with foul language?

The time is right for all "hell" to break loose against Israel and the U.S. before year end.  Obama and the global socialists do not want to vacate the White House or control the Senate and Justice Department.  We can expect planned terrorist (even by our own government) attacks to drive chaos in America and pit citizens against citizens.  Who's to argue against this wasn't one of those attacks?  And, was this specific AK-46 one of those automatic military style weapons the BATFE "sold" in Arizona a while back?

Who cares if he used and AK-47 a M14 or Plasma Blaster in the 100k watt range? It was the idiot---- not the gun ......Make it sound like he was gunning for everybody and invinsible. 
Does everybody remember the DC Snipers?  Two nuts and crappy old car....played right into   perfect timing thinking it was AL Queada or sholdl I SAY... AL CIA AIDA who did 9/11 to get all the tooling up for IRAQ and AFGHANISTAN..but again my point...more sensationalism by MEDIA and some other nut soooner or later will go off /copy cat. RIGHT? Wish these nuts would just televise themselves blowing up in a cornfield with Dynamite on internet instead of killing innocent people.AGREE?

I say from this point forward we outsource all of our state and federal prison systems to China, the prisoners will be sent to our China run jails immediately after the guilty verdict.   China will then handle the prisoners as they see fit.  I believe this will greatly reduce crime knowing of the consequences, I mean what the hell, China does everything else for us.....this would actually be a service with positive results.

MIND CONTROL....Deliberate programming and deep hypnosis.

It's always the same: Mass casualties with an automatic rifle in a public place, then shooter commits suicide.... right before the anniversary of a horrific event.

The story runs much deeper than just another crazy guy with a gun
.
It's Manufactured Mass Terror....an instrument of power.

Wake up.

This was a fully automatic AK, something you cannot walk into the average gun shop and buy, illegal in fact unless you have a class three license.

Black Market?

AK-47's are used for hunting bunny rabbits and shooting Pepsi cans.  There's no reason that any American can't have these guns at home.  2nd Amendment. SECOND AMENDMENT!!!!!  AAAAAAARRGH!

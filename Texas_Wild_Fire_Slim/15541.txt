Disaster Relief USA (DRUSA) has partnered with Dare2Care Dare2Share to provide assistance to Texas wildfire victims.
“The Texas wildfires have been devastating,” said DRUSA Director Bill Terry. “We’re so thankful that C.D. Lawhon and his ministry are available to help us meet the need.”
The ministry is based out of Midlothain, Tx, and is affiliated with the Great Plains Conference. Director C.D. Lawhon says Dare2 deployed a truckload of water, food, paper products, and diapers to the Austin, Tx. area. The truck arrived around 4:30 this morning.
Lawhon says the items will be used to service several feeding kitchens stationed near the fires.
According to A.P. News, the wildfires have destroyed nearly 800 homes and killed at least two people. The fires are located in Bastrop, just outside Austin, Tx.
How to Help
To provide financial assistance for this project, contact DRUSA at drusainfo@iphc.org or (405) 787-7110 ext. 3224.
Lawhon’s ministry is also taking donations for wildfire victims. To donate food, water, or personal care items, contact Dare2Care Dare2Share at (817) 881-1642.

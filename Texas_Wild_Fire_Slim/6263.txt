Adopt A Job Creator asks you to give a little to those who have a lot, so they can continue to enjoy their way of life.  How much would you give a day to make sure an Investment Banker can continue to lobby congress for de-regulation, or to make sure a CEO of a large company can afford that $6,000 shower curtain he NEEDS.To those who have a lot, more is needed.Follow the Kleier Brothers on twitter:Sean Kleier -- http://www.twitter.com/seankleierRyan Kleier -- http://www.twitter.com/rykleierstweetsFunkanomics -- http://www.twitter.com/funkanomics

This is just one example of how America operates in todays times, and it's these types of corruption that is responsible for our countries fall from power as a world﻿ leader. Everything is about money, there is no honor left in America, and we're to blame, because we let it happen.

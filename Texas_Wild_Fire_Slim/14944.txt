Quetta blasts to avenge Qaeda arrests: Taliban


QUETTA - 7th September 2011 

By AFP


The Tahreek e Taliban has claimed responsibility for twin  suicide bombs in Quetta Wednesday that killed at least 24 people, saying  they were to avenge the arrests of Al Qaeda operatives.
“We carried out the attacks,” Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan told AFP in a phone call from an undisclosed location.
He  said the two bombs, which also wounded 82 people, were “to avenge the  arrest of our mujahedin brothers by Pakistani security forces in Quetta  recently”.
Asked whether he was referring to the arrests,  announced Monday, of Younis al-Mauritani believed to be a senior Al  Qaeda leader who had planned attacks abroad and two others, he said  “Yes.”
“We will launch a bigger attack in future,” Ehsan said.
Pakistan  said Monday that its forces had arrested al-Mauritani, described as a  senior Al Qaeda leader believed to have been responsible for planning  attacks on the United States, Europe and Australia.
He was picked  up in the suburbs of Quetta the main town in southwestern Balochistan  province, bordering Afghanistan and Iran along with two other  high-ranking operatives after the US and Pakistani spy agencies joined  forces.
The twin suicide bombs on Wednesday targeted Pakistan’s  paramilitary force, the Frontier Corps which was responsible for the  capture of the Al Qaeda operatives, police said.
One attacker  detonated his bomb-laden car outside the residence of the deputy chief  of the Frontier Corps in Quetta city, before a second attacker blew  himself up inside the house, said senior police official Hamid Shakil.
The  attack on the home of deputy chief Farrukh Shahzad wounded him, killed  his wife and injured at least one of his children, security officials  said.

Improved communication among first responders and a higher level of awareness among citizens has better prepared the nation for attacks like 9/11, but terrorism experts aren't sure whether that translates into making the country safer.
"Right now, here in our own community, are people who are trained to respond to a biological or chemical attack, and that wouldn't have been the case 10 years ago," said Kem Bennett, founder of Texas Task Force 1, who also serves as dean and vice chancellor of engineering at Texas A&M. "The equipment is here, millions of dollars in funding has come in to help prepare. But can it be better? Yes. And that will always be the case."
Bennett also has served various roles within the Department of Homeland Security and has been chair of an advisory council to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
He said prior to the attacks a decade ago in New York City and the nation's capitol, getting a conversation started about terrorism and preparedness was difficult. 
The attacks brought the discussion of preparedness to the forefront, though. 
"A lot of expertise from the military community was transferred to local first responders," he said. "In my opinion, the response this county had in putting together training programs was a fairly amazing thing, done very quickly, and very well."
Bryan Fire Chief Mike Donoho was among the local first responders who helped with the search and rescue efforts at the World Trade Center site. He said he quickly realized how radio communication problems there were hindering progress. 
It was a difficulty he hadn't faced in Brazos County, he said, because firefighters, EMS and police officers here had capabilities to communicate with one another for years prior to 2001. 
"We've been very blessed to have a small community with first responders on the cutting edge," he said.
College Station Police Chief Jeff Capps said efforts to improve radio interoperability have continued, with the establishment of the Brazos Valley Wide Area Communications System. Millions of dollars in grants are being used to fund the program, which aims to make sure all agencies within the seven-county region can communicate with one another. 
It's part of a plan to achieve statewide interoperability by 2015. 
The desire to prepare for an attack and decrease vulnerabilities could come at a price, according to some, such as Charles Hermann, director of the master's program in International Affairs at the Bush School of Government and Public Service.
"Suppose we gave government the power to monitor everyone's email, or everyone's telephone or cellphone calls. That might make us safer, but it's a tremendous violation of the basic sense of privacy that's been a cornerstone of our society," he said. "So, there are tradeoffs here that I suspect we're increasingly going to take -- steps that increase security but compromise civil liberties." 
Danny Davis, director of the Homeland Security Certification Program within the Bush School of Government and Public Service, said some steps taken to increase security have been very effective while others, such as the establishment of the Transportation Security Administration and air travel policies, still have a long way to go. 
"We've got this system in place now where we treat everyone like a potential terrorist, and I'm not sure how much good that does," he said. "There's a lot of wasted effort in those processes, and I don't have the answer, but I know we can do better than we are."

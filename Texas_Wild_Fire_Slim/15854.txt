       The government has asked the Swiss authorities to reject the plea for political asylum made by Bramdagh Bugti, who heads an outlawed Baloch rebel group and extradite him to Pakistan. The authorities have yet to hear from Berne about their request, but they say the initial response of the Swiss government was that of consideration. Bramdagh Bugti a 30-year old heads the separatist Baloch Republican Party and its militant wing, the Baloch Republican Army. He has been accused of attacks against settlers in Balochistan government installations and armed forces as well.

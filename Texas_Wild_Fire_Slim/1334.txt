By DAVID BAUDER, Associated Press
NEW YORK — For many in New York and Washington, Sept. 11, 2001, was a personal experience, an attack on their cities. Most everywhere else in the world, it was a television event.
TV's commemoration as the 10th anniversary approaches on Sunday puts that day in many different contexts. There is one place, however, for people to see the Sept. 11 attacks and the week after as they unfolded, without any filters.
The Internet Archive, a California-based organization that collects audio, moving images and Web pages for historical purposes, has put together a television news archive of that day's coverage.
More than 20 channels were recorded with more than 3,000 hours of television. Besides major U.S. networks like ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC, the Internet Archive has posted online TV recordings from Moscow, Paris, London, Baghdad, Tokyo, Ottawa and elsewhere.
The site is available at . http://www.archive.org/details/911/day
The material is valuable to researchers, but the Internet Archive wanted to make it easy to use so the general public can go back and see what that day was like, said Brewster Kahle, the organization's director.
"It is one of the top four or five events that have happened on television," Kahle said. "You can think of putting a man on the moon, the Watergate hearings, the Kennedy assassination. I'm hopeful that people will come to this and make their own decisions about how they want to think about it, as opposed to politicians who have been pushing and pulling the event for years."
The archive begins at 8 a.m. ET, or 46 minutes before American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.
That alone is interesting for the striking contrast it provides with the last seemingly carefree moments before several tough years. On NBC's "Today" show, Katie Couric talks brightly of "a beautiful fall morning in Manhattan" and the camera pans to a cheering crowd. Charles Gibson mocks his "Good Morning America" colleague Diane Sawyer for writing notes on her hand, and ABC's Claire Shipman said the biggest news in Washington was Michael Jordan giving hints he might return to the basketball court.
Out of a commercial late in the morning shows, even cutting one commercial short on CNN, suddenly came camera shots of a burning World Trade Center, ones that would dominate screens for several hours.
Newscasters were careful before the story became clear. Matt Lauer initially called it an "accident." Morning shows effectively used phone calls from eyewitnesses adding details beyond the faraway camera shots. "It's mind-boggling and it's horrifying," one witness, Jennifer Oberstein, told Lauer.
Then came one of many unthinkable moments: a second plane darting into pictures and crashing into the second tower, exploding in a fireball and falling debris.
"We just saw another plane coming in to the other side," Gibson said. "This looks like there is some sort of concerted effort to attack the World Trade Center that is underway."
Later, when the towers collapsed, one after the other, it seemed so inconceivable that anchors initially couldn't grasp what viewers had seen on the screen. NBC's Tom Brokaw talked of structural damage so severe that the buildings would probably have to be brought down – after one of them already came down on its own.
"The whole side has collapsed," ABC's Peter Jennings said when the first tower came down.
"The whole building has collapsed," ABC's reporter on the scene, Don Dahler, corrected him.
"The whole building has collapsed?" Jennings responded.
CNN's Aaron Brown responded with the horror most viewers no doubt felt when the second tower fell. "Good lord," he said. "There are no words."
"The landscape of New York has just been changed and you have to presume that thousands of lives have been extinguished," Jennings said.
In those early hours, ABC's John Miller and NBC's Andrea Mitchell had raised the name of Osama bin Laden as possibly the man behind the attacks, even as the networks reported the false claim of a Palestinian organization taking credit.
Also interesting are the perspectives from overseas. The BBC in London, for example, showed video of people jumping or falling from the towers – images that American networks stayed away from. In Moscow, a newscaster who broke into a program to report on the towers collapsing displayed a voice halting with emotion.
The site is easy to navigate, with timelines that direct users to specific events of the morning, such as when the second plane hit the trade center and when each tower collapsed. It can be frustrating to use, however, as the video is displayed in 30- or 40-second blocks instead of continuous streams. And there are occasional gaps; large portions of CBS' coverage is missing, for example.
Kahle said he believed it was important to provide this resource. There are surprisingly few ways for people to go back and see television news reports, at least compared to print, he noted.
"It is so important yet it has been, up until now, quite ephemeral," he said.

Paul Brandeis Raushenbush: Ten Years After 9/11: Has Religion Driven Us Apart or Drawn Us Together?


		                        
																9/11 made it clear that religion, which had been ignored and overlooked for decades, was still a force, and perhaps the force in people's personal and communal lives.                            







Rev. Dr. Martha R. Jacobs: Playing Poker with Police at Ground Zero


		                        
																I am so thankful for the opportunity to serve those who were there to protect us and recover the remains of those who died. It was not something I never envisioned when I answered a call to serve God.                            







Bishop James Magness: Spirituality Forged in Smoke and Fire


		                        
																That day, I began learning that the affirmation of our spiritual differences is the only vehicle through which we can build the framework for common ground.                            







Rev. Earl E. Johnson: Providing Disaster Relief with the American Red Cross, 10 Years After 9/11


		                        
																What has emerged in my experience is that those who have training and experience with the chronically ill also make good disaster spiritual care providers, without exception.

				Ten years on and any excuse to milk this attack. It was one of the pretexts for two middle-eas­tern wars, no doubt it will be added to the narrative of middle-eas­tern interventi­on whenever public opinion runs against the government­. Seeing as Bin Laden was a major factor in John Dough's need to continue over there, they need to revert back to the images of something that happened 10 years ago for their imperialis­tic march. How many middle-eas­tern people have died as a direct result of US interventi­on in the last 10 years? Where is the footage for the civillian deaths? Hidden that's where.

				I was sitting on my couch watching CNN as it all happened on that bright sunny day. I remember being terrified of what malice would happen next. Remember at that time no one knew how many planes and attacks there would be or where, for all I knew at the time there could have been dozens of attacks all across the nation. I started to watch the video to this story but stopped it after a few seconds. I don't want to see it again, once was enough.

				The media doesn't seem to know when to quit. I am just as empathetic as anyone else, but I got so tired of hearing about New Orleans, the disaster in Japan, Casey Anthoney, the flooding in Vermont, the fires in Texas, etc. Now, I guess we will be haunted by at least a week of footage of the 9/11 tragedy. Isn't there a point where the hype becomes intrusive and dishonors the victims?

				Lots of people followed this further - and are still doing so.

But the MSM owners h8 them.
So they don't get heard.

There's a stack of video info for anybody who can be bothered to look at it critically­.

I understand and sympathize with those who lost loved ones and would rather not look, but that doesn't cover the millions of Americans whose critical faculties don't go into shutdown when something dreadful happens.

The official story just doesn't make sense, and most of us have seen enough Discovery Channel programs about controlled demolition to be able to draw some inescapabl­e conclusion­s.
Personally­, I'd LOVE to believe the official story, and I'd love to be able to trust that our leaders have our best interests as a nation at heart.

But every day we get new evidence of the fact that we are of no importance to them.

				I sat through days of coverage as it happened and taped most of it .. . till this day I have not reviewed it. That was a highly emotional time and seen as the truth came out and the killers pointed out. If anyone does not believe that religous fanatics did not do this then they don't have all their senses. There was nothing complicate­d about the attack, just good planning and some brainwashe­d individual­s.

				I lost three family members and also want no part of the media circus. I will remember them in spirit and will tell those family members who never got to know them, who they were, what they were like, etc. The best way to honor them, in my view, is to live lives of compassion­, kindness, and service to others. Just my opinion.

				It would seem the writer convenient­ly left Fox News out of this article. After a bubble-hea­ded anchor on CNN on 9/11 said the SECOND plane that hit the trade centers was maybe an accident too, I changed over to Fox and have watched it ever since. Shephard Smith's coverage atop a nearby building in Manhattan on 9/11 was commendabl­e as well as brave. Oh yeah, and they knew it was an attack, not an accident.

				Then ask the thousands of witnesses that saw it hit. Or, you could simply "Google" it and see the pictures of the airplane. Interestin­g that NO ONE saw a missile hit it. Or was it that ALL those people who saw the plane hit were "in on it.?" How convenient they all (hundreds, if not thousands) just happened to be at the right place at the right time.

				In those early hours, ABC's John Miller and NBC's Andrea Mitchell had raised the name of Osama bin Laden as possibly the man behind the attacks.
Now how did they know it was Osama on the same day? While Bush was sitting in a classroom full of children and never moved. Afterwards Bush spoke on TV and said don't listen to conspiracy theory's. Interestin­g the Bush family had business with the Bin Laden for years prior (look it up) and Osama's brother was meeting with George Bush father on 9/11 in Washington­. Anyone who believes 19 terrorists took over 4 planes with box cutters while flying around for 1 1/2 hrs while our Air Force did nothing is ignorant.

				Ummm...aft­er the second plane hit the WTC, I and many other people suspected it might have been OBL, since he was behind other terrorist attacks, and had previously threatened the USA. You must not have been following the news close enough back then.

And the terrorists were not flying the planes for 90 minutes. They took over the planes sometime after the planes took off, which was much less than 90 minutes.

Texas A&M golfer Aly Smith watches her putt roll past the 18th hole during the ÔMoÕMorial Tournament on Sunday at Traditions Golf Club.




No. 18 at the 'Mo'morial was set up for an opportunity to gain a stroke back at the end of a long round. 
A short par 5 at Traditions Golf Club, the only true trouble was a creek in front of the green to discourage most of the young women from going for it in two.
It turned out to be anything but easy for Texas A&M, as the Aggies played the 447-yard finishing hole in 9-over on the opening day of the 54-hole event.
"That's ridiculous considering how many birdies I've seen us make on this hole," A&M coach Trelle McCombs said. "And they know that. In asking them what went on, none of them said it was a mental thing. It was just they hit some chunky wedge shots."
Two players hit into the hazard on their third shots and a third barely cleared it and was only able to punch it out of the thick grass a few yards. The fourth cleared the creek and went in the greenside bunker from 200 yards out after having to punch out from a poor drive and a fifth found the creek from about 215 yards out, going for it in two.
With the highest of five scores for each team thrown out, the four Aggies who totaled a 23-over 311, good for fifth, were seven-over on No. 18. Texas, which is tied for second at 299, was two-under on the hole, a nine-stroke swing.
Auburn, led by co-medalist Carlie Yadloczky's 2-under 70, held the team lead at 296. Kentucky was tied with Texas for second thanks in part to Ashleigh Albrecht's 70.
Ironically, the No. 1 player for Auburn, Haley Wilson (81), and Texas, Madison Pressel (78), had their scores thrown out.
Wilson wasn't alone in posting an 80 or above with nearly half the field -- 32 of 68 players -- shooting at least 8-over on Sunday. 
A&M, which fielded two teams, contributed to the number with 7 of 10 players firing 80 or above.
"Oh gosh nobody [on A&M] played as well as they could have," McCombs said. "With some of these hole locations out here, they were easy."
The conditions were also ideal, with very little wind and the heat not really becoming a factor until later in the round.
Albrecht had little trouble, hitting 15 of 18 greens in regulation, but she did sympathize with those who had difficulty.
"It's all about hitting fairways and greens here; it's all placement," said Albrecht, a junior who won the UCF Challenge last spring and qualified the for the Women's U.S. Open the summer before she arrived at Kentucky. "If you are going to miss a green you have to miss it in the right spot, find the a certain bail out spot or you are in trouble."
Auburn's Yadloczky birdied Nos. 1, 10 and 12, bogeying only 13.
Albrecht, starting on No. 10, birdied Nos. 12, 18, 2 and 6. She reached the par-5 18th with a 5-iron after one of the longest drives of the day. 
"Yeah, I was hitting it well," said Albrecht. "I didn't make the putts I wanted to, but can't complain about a 70."
Nicole Vandermade of Texas was the only other player to break par, at 1-under. North Texas' Jacey Chun and Texas' Desiree Dubreuil were at even par.
Katerina Ruzickova had the lone bogey on the 18th for the A&M 'A' team and paced all Aggies with a 74, good for tied for sixth. Susy Grunden shot a 78, Mary Michael Maggio, in her first tournament for A&M after transferring from LSU, had a 79, while Sarah Beth Davis and Chelsea Mocio posted 80 and 81, respectively.
"We had some bogeys and doubles but we bounced back and made some birdies too," said McCombs. "We just ran out of holes, because you can't bounce back from 18."
A&M's 'B' team played No. 18 at even par but was tied for last with Michigan State at 321. Aly Smith, Kirby Kramer and Janell Lysack all had 80s, while Natalie Reeves shot 81 and Patricia Garcia an 82.
It was the first collegiate event for Kramer and Garcia.
The second round begins at 8 a.m. on Monday.

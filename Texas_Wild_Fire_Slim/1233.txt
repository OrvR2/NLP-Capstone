Calif. principal accused of molesting 7 girlsBy SHEILA V KUMAR - Associated Press | AP – 2 hrs 6 mins ago

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The principal of a small private school in the suburbs of the state capital was arrested Wednesday on charges that he fondled at least seven girls over the past 15 years, months after he was accused of touching female students under their clothes.Robert Benson Adams, 60, was the owner and principal of the Creative Frontiers School in Citrus Heights, a middle-class suburb about 20 miles northeast of Sacramento. It was shut down in mid-July after a complaint was filed by the California Department of Social Services.Adams has denied the allegations and said he welcomed "a full investigation" at a press conference a few days after the closure of the school."But I assure you, I am very confident that nothing inappropriate has happened," he said then.Adams now faces six felony counts of committing lewd and lascivious acts on children under 14 and one misdemeanor charge of annoying or molesting a child under 18, according to a criminal complaint filed in Sacramento County Superior Court. He was scheduled to be arraigned Friday.The girls, who were between 4 and 7, told investigators that Adams, known as "Mr. Bob" to his students, often called them into his office, where he would pull them onto his lap and fondled them, according to the complaint.Citrus Heights Police Chief Christopher Boyd said more witnesses have come forward since July and that the most recent crime occurred this June."We took the time that was necessary to find the facts and the truth that has resulted in these charges being filed today," Boyd said.Two teachers separately told investigators they walked in on Adams touching young girls.Bethany Soloman, a teacher at the school, said she saw Adams put his hand under the skirt of a young girl who was sitting on his lap in his office in 2007, according to the complaint. It did not say whether she reported the incident then.Preschool teacher April Thompson, who was listed as a staff member on the school's website before it was closed, told investigators she came back from her lunch break one day in June to find Adams lying on a mat next to a 4-year-old during nap time.The child's shirt had been pulled up and Adams was rubbing her stomach, according to the complaint. The girl's parents told Thompson the next day that their daughter said Adams had touched her inappropriately.Thompson did not return a phone message left Wednesday by The Associated Press. Messages left with Adams' attorney, Linda Parisi, also were not returned.Adams suffered a medical condition when he was arrested and was taken to a local hospital, where he remains in police custody, Boyd said. He declined to elaborate on Adams' condition.Adams ran the school from its opening in 1975 until the city of Citrus Heights and state officials revoked the school's business and daycare licenses in July. The school sits on an idyllic tree-lined campus with a horse pasture and red, cottage-like classrooms.About 180 students in preschool through sixth grade attended Creative Frontiers. Tuition for a full year was $6,507, according to the school's website.Since the school was shuttered, parents have inundated a Facebook page for Creative Frontiers in support of Adams and his family. Many have volunteered at rallies and fundraisers in an effort to reopen the school.Theresa Del Biaggio, a parent who said she has been actively involved with trying to reopen the school, said she was devastated to hear about the charges filed against Adams."I did read the charges that were filed, and I have to be honest, it still seems relatively ambiguous," she said. "It seems fishy and far-fetched to me the way it's coming out."Lisa Lambert, whose 10-year-old daughter would have started her second year at the school this fall, said her daughter thought the world of Adams."Currently, I'm pretty shocked. I'm saddened. But in a way, I'm kind of relieved, because I'm hoping they can start their defense and clear his name," she said.Adams could face up to eight years in a state prison for each of the six felony counts if he is convicted. He could also face a fine of up to $5,000 and at least a year in a county jail if convicted on the misdemeanor charge.

i'm not sure if someone is trying to ruin his reputation or if he's guilty. like the poster 'danny' said before me, an accusation is not proof.  i wonder why the women that worked with him saw these things happening a year ago, and never said a word.   if i saw something like that, i'd report it immediately.

An accusation is not proof. Still better than public schools in California.

1 one sided account from 4 years ago and one recently do not mean that the man is guilty of anything. The teachers could easily have fabricated the stories and had the children lie to their parents. Amazing how the police fall for hearsay evidence without evidence of any kind to support it. Sounds like they have an ax to grind with the principal and talk about a witchhunt. The police chief said they took their time and found the truth...ha ha ha. Nothing in this article shows they have the truth, just emotional over-reaction. Unless real evidence is presented it is a he said/she  case.

I rub my 5yo's belly too...but I'm her PARENT. For anyone other than me, her dad, or her immediate relatives to rub her back or belly is just creepy. Any school employee who witnessed anything inappropriate and didn't share that with authorities should be criminally charged as accomplices. Reading through this garbage makes me glad we homeschool. Pedophiles know where to find access. Come on, do you REALLY want to trust education professional who allows themselves to be referred to as "Mr. Bob"? My radar goes off just hearing that alone. When it comes to your kids, trust no one. You'll never be able to undo the damage done to them by a pedo. I hope the parents in that school figure this out quickly.

AFTER KNOWING THE ALLEGATIONS....some of these stupid parents want this man back in charge of the school and children cuz they feel he is innocent. What part of " HE HAS BEEN SEEN ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS TOUCHING CHILDREN DONT YOU PARENTS UNDERSTAND"' ???? !!!!!!    YOU want a child molester touching your children ....as you think this man is wrongly accused. No wonder your kids got molested....you failed to investigate this school or its owner/principle. Stupid Parents.

Again "he said" versus "she said" case.  Repeat of the 1980s preschool case in Manhattan, California in which an 85 year old female owner and principal of the school in the wheelchair was arrested and charged with molesting several children.  Results ?

1. The 85 year old lady was found innocent, but she spent three years in jail during investigation.

2. The gossip was started by a single mom of a child enrolled at the preschool, who herself was undergoing periodic psychiatric treatment dealing with her own private life.

3.  During the child, a child psychologist interviewed several children in the private room attached to the court room .  Fortunately, the interview was recorded on the camera and broadcast on TV.  The psychologist was offering candies to the child if the child answered her question regarding touching inappropriately in favor of the prosecutor.  If the child answered negatively or ignored, then the psychologist would keep on repeating the question until she got positive answer.  The child under questioning seemed to be annoyed by the questions that did not make sense to the child, but was definitely interested in the candy.  The psychologist and the candy was paid by the prosecutor.

4. Apparently, children talked to each other during school hours while playing, and confused fiction with reality and spread the teacher gossips among themselves.  They were 3 to 5 years old.  No chance of charging them for lying under oath.

5. The whole yard of the school was dug up to find material evidence of what the children were claiming, like killing rabbits by the teacher to scare off the molested children and shut up their  mouths.  Nothing was discovered.  Even a local church where animal sacrifices were reported by the children refuted the stories.  But all negative findings were ignored by the prosecutor.  

The case was based solely on verbal testimonies of  3-5 year old playful children, one crazy mom, one overzealous child psychologist and one overzealous prosecutor.

Net result ?  A respectable 85 year old educator lost her good name, reputation, career, dream of life and her lifetime savings.  She was never compensated by the State, for wrongful prosecution or wrongful destruction of property.  

Most important, she lost her freedom at the hands of "we, the people".

Now another California special.

Going to be hard to win a trial with such allegations
I think he will be found guilty regardless of evidence.  With more than one accuser, the jury usually err on the side of children.    Doesn't matter if we agree or disagree, thats our system at work.

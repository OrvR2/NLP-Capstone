Central bank keeps rate at 1%AFP – 20 hrs ago

The central bank on Wednesday maintained its key lending interest rate at one percent, citing a deteriorated global economic outlook for halting its incremental rise from a historic low.
The rate decision had been widely expected after the Canadian economy contracted in the second quarter and amid worries about the weak US economy and Europe's sovereign debt crisis.
"The global economic outlook has deteriorated in recent weeks," the Bank of Canada said in a statement.
"The European sovereign debt crisis has intensified, a broad range of data has signalled slower global growth, and financial market volatility has increased sharply," it said.
As well, revisions of economic data now show that the US recession was "deeper and its recovery has been shallower" than previously reported, implying that US growth "will be weaker than previously anticipated."
Going forward, the bank said it expects that American household spending will be more subdued due to high personal debt levels, high losses of wealth and a "tough" labour market.
The US fiscal stimulus will also soon turn into a "material fiscal drag" while European fiscal and financial strains have triggered a "retrenchment" from risk-taking that could lead to "more severe dislocations" in global financial markets.
Emerging market economies have seen robust growth, but this will be affected by weakness in major advanced economies, the Bank of Canada predicted.
After stalling in the second quarter, Canadian economic growth is expected to resume in the second half of this year, it said.
However, exports are expected to remain a "major source of weakness" due to modest global demand and the high Canadian dollar.

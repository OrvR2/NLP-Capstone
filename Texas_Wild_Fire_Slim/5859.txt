Monique Exum, a 36-year old woman in the Bronx, has claimed responsibility to stuffing her dead roommate's body into a suitcase and then leaving it outside an abandoned home, according to The Daily News. 
The body of John Davis, Exum's 74-year old roommate, was found on Sunday, after a 911 call reported a suspicious suitcase outside 1309 Needham Avenue in the Williamsbridge neighborhood in the Bronx. 
However, Exum admits no wrongdoing to Sunday's disturbing discovery and it claims she acted on fear.
"My friend told me if someone dies in your apartment you go to jail, so I got really afraid,' Exum said to police. "I didn't know what to do."
Exum is being held on a $500 bond and was charged with improper body removal. Davis's cause of death has yet to be determined.

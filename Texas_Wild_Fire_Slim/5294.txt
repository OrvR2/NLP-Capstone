New Yorker dismisses attack from Church of ScientologyBy Joe PompeoMedia ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Joe Pompeo | The Cutline – Wed, Aug 31, 2011

The Church of Scientology has been known to go to great lengths to retaliate against members of the press who produce skeptical reports about its operations. Case in point: last summer, when the church produced an entire magazine devoted to blasting Anderson Cooper, and then handed the rag out in front of CNN headquarters.
The church's latest target is the New Yorker, which published a 25,000-word profile by Lawrence Wright of celebrity Scientology defector Paul Haggis back in February. The piece depicted alleged widespread corruption and otherwise bizarre behavior within the institutional hierarchy of the screenwriter's former religion.
Six months later, Scientologists are now milling about outside the Conde Nast building distributing a 51-page parody issue of their in-house magazine, Freedom, called "The New Yorker: What a Load of Balderdash," as well as a three-part DVD series attacking the venerable weekly.
The New York Times reports: "The church goes to surprising lengths in attempting to discredit The New  Yorker and its staff, naming editors, fact-checkers and others who  worked on the Scientology article by name . . . . The church mocks The New Yorker as no better than a supermarket tabloid  and even created a fake New Yorker cover with the headline 'Remnick  Denies Alien Baby Claim,' a dig at the magazine's editor, David Remnick."
Gawker's Hamilton Nolan characterized the lavish character assault thusly: "Here they are, six months later, to get their  revenge ... The level of work, at least, that went into producing this outraged  magazine spoof is impressive. The fact that Scientology's method of  choice for refuting a critical story is to criticize as unstable liars  sources who were once top Scientology insiders is less impressive."
A spokeswoman for the New Yorker told The Cutline: "We're confident in Lawrence Wright's reporting and our fact-checking process. And we stand by the story we published."
Indeed, it would seem highly unlikely that any inaccuracies or mischaracterizations would have eluded the New Yorker's notoriously rigid fact-checking process. As NPR reported when the piece came out, the magazine assigned five fact-checkers to the article, who submitted a whopping 971 queries to the Church ahead of publication. Wright, the research team and New Yorker editor David Remnick likewise met with Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis and four of his attorneys in an eight-hour session before press time.

It amazes me that the Church of Scientology has been able to attract so many seemingly intelligent people. The South Park episode on Scientology was really quite accurate when describing the church's teachings. L Ron Hubbard was science fiction writer who just one day had a flash of genius and suddenly knew how all creation came about. Very bizarre beliefs.

Scientology is a business not a religion. It should be taxed.

Like islam and "whatever" other religions, another "cult of deception" that does NOT treat other people the way they, themselves, want to be treated.  Only worse.

Sorry, folks, there is no truth to any of it. Great tax dodge though. ROBTHEPUBLICAN STYLE!

Don't really care either way but don't you all think it's a little strange that they were able to fact check anything given the secrecy of Scientology? The article states that there were 971 queries to the church from the fact checkers but how many of those were actually answered, if any? Was it really fact checking or was it just ask for confirmation, don't get a response, write that it's true?

No more idiotic or ridiculous than any other religion. Just saying. . .

Two things, first Patrick, what intelligent people? Tom Cruise? Good actor but......
Second to Rat Fink McRoy, Scientology is no different then any religion, and not in any form like atheism. You truly lack an education.

Scientologists any wackier than atheists?  Atheists think the Universe just magically appeared.  Sort of like me Lucky Charms are magically delicious.

$cientology says that we're all possessed by space alien ghosts  - and will get rid of them for hundreds of thousands of dollars.  And give you super powers to boot...

While obviously ridiculous, space alien overlords seem more likely than a preggers virgin.

The thing is, the lengths they go to to discredited "attacks" are all directed at their own constituents. Why do they have to try so darn hard to keep church members AS members? 

Maybe if you didn't have to pay an arm and a leg to go through a few dozen levels of "cleansing" you're told you need and then keep paying the rest of your life it wouldn't be so bad. 

People that believe in something are traditionally fervent and generous in their donations. If Scientology just said "we have a Way here, it might work for you" and didn't charge out the wazoo for it, they'd probably have oodles of believers and wouldn't need to defend against attacks (in part because the money component would be gone and that is usually at the bottom of legal issues when a disgruntled ex-member realizes they were fleeced), their members wouldn't need to be reminded to believe, they wouldn't question or leave in the first place. It's like they're trying to grip sand tighter and tighter in their fists.

Scientology has only been around for a few decades. Give them a thousand years and they'll have made stuff up to cover all the loose ends, just like Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. Or as their followers are known: The Crissy's, the Muzzies, and the Jizzys.

If Scientology had any merit they would be able to give well thought out counter arguments that back up the claims of their "religion" instead of just attacking or trying to sue anyone who criticizes them.

Hey, where is the Scientology candidate for the '12 election? This way, the GOP will have a full lineup of nuts to run for office...

If they were truly a "religion"  they wouldn't go about attacking people like this.  Just more proof that they aren't a religion, and should have their federal protection revoked.  I mean seriously this is just too much.

In a world full of kook religions and cults, the Church of Scientology stands head and shoulders above most.

The "Church" of Scientology is just a USELESS way to get people to hand over their money so that a few people heading it can be filthy rich for spreading false hopes!

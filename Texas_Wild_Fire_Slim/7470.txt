A Post-Labor Day Look At Amazon's Jobs And Tax StrategyBy Janet Novack | Forbes – Mon, Sep 5, 2011





When it comes to a jobs program, Barack Obama could use a dash of Jeff Bezos' chutzpah.
Back in February, I speculated that  Amazon.com's days of sales-tax free selling might be numbered. More specifically, I argued that the Internet behemoth's build out of “fulfillment centers” across the country  would prove the biggest threat to its long-running competitive strategy of avoiding the collection of sales taxes.  It’s one thing to argue that selling to a state’s residents over the Web doesn’t give Amazon the sort of physical connection (or nexus) to a state which the Supreme Court ruled in 1992 is needed before that state can force a retailer to collect sales tax.  It’s another to say: “Ignore that one million square foot warehouse down the road. It’s not really physically in your town, using your roads and police and fire protection.”  Even if holding the warehouse in a separate subsidiary from it retail unit (as Amazon does) might, after a lot of litigation, protect it from having to collect sales tax in some states,  the strategy is a  bit of an insult to common sense and not great PR.
But Amazon has been boldly attempting to turn that liability into an asset, offering to locate warehouses and their jobs in states that agree to exempt it from sales tax collection obligations for some number of years.  Most recently, it offered to create 7,000 jobs in California if the state would delay until at least 2014 a new law which took effect on July 1 and aims to require Internet retailers to collect tax on sales to California residents. (Technically, buyers owe the tax whether the retailers collect it or not, but few  consumers bother to send off their pennies to their states.)
Amazon’s jobs strategy can be looked at two ways. On the one hand, here's a rich corporation (market cap of $95 billion and Amazon founder and CEO Bezos was the 30th richest man in the world as of last March) demanding special treatment at a time when special favors for Wall Street and big banks have helped fuel the populist Tea Party movement. On the other, Amazon is really hiring when the unemployment rate is 9.1% (12% in California) and both President Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney are preparing major jobs speeches.  Amazon’s fulfillment center jobs, for the most part, aren’t high paid. But they have benefits and are available to high school graduates so long as (according to the Amazon’s application site ) they can read and write English, lift 49 pounds and stand or walk for up to 12 hours. That’s something, at a time when the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports high school graduates with no college have a 9.6% unemployment rate, versus 4.3% for college graduates.
Moreover, lest anyone cynically question its good intentions, Amazon is supporting the “Main Street Fairness Act” – a bill introduced by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in July which would allow states that abide by the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (21 now do) to  force Internet sellers to collect their taxes. This isn’t a new position for Amazon, which has long said it favors a federal solution. Conveniently for Amazon, that bill has no Republican sponsors and no chance of passing the current Congress. (Anti-tax enforcer Grover Norquist has already denounced it as "a massive $23 billion Internet tax hike that is dead on arrival for any fiscally responsible lawmaker.” All but six Republicans in the House have signed The Taxpayer Protection Pledge circulated by Norquist’s Americans For Tax Reform.)
So with Congressional action improbable for now, how is Amazon’s jobs offensive working? Well, like the sorts of jobs programs some left leaning economists wish Obama would propose, it should be judged as a short term strategy, designed to allow Amazon to  continue building fulfillment centers at a record pace (15 announced as of its last quarterly earnings conference call) while increasing its online dominance and postponing the day when it has to collect sales taxes in most states. (Currently, Amazon collects in only five states, whereas the next five largest online sellers--Staples, Apple, Dell, Office Depot and Wal-Mart -- collect nationwide.)
Amazon’s jobs strategy has worked in two smaller Southeastern states--- although in a messy fashion and, one could argue, in part because public officials quietly made promises to Amazon before those promises were subjected to public scrutiny or lobbying assaults by the bricks and mortar retailers.
On June 8th, South Carolina Republican Governor Nikki Halley allowed a five year sales-tax collection exemption narrowly tailored for Amazon to take effect without her signature, despite the fact that the she had earlier opposed it as “bad policy” and was excoriated by some Tea Party members for her refusal to veto it. (In her defense, the deal had been promised by the administration of her predecessor, Republican Mark Sanford.) On cue, Amazon immediately announced it would begin hiring for two warehouses it is building in South Carolina that will ultimately employ 2,000. In Tennessee, meanwhile, Republican Gov. Bill Haslam has said he’ll honor a deal Amazon made with his Democratic predecessor to allow Amazon to operate two warehouses in the state without collecting sales taxes from that state’s residents. (As a reward, Amazon has announced a third facility for Tennessee.) That deal, too, remains controversial, with retailers in the state threatening a suit to block it.
But the promise of 6,000 jobs and the support of Texas Governor Rick Perry, now a Republican presidential contender, didn’t win the day for Amazon in Texas’ Republican dominated legislature. In May, Perry vetoed a bill that would have made clear that an Internet retailer with a sister subsidiary warehouse in the state has to collect sales taxes from Texas residents. (Ironically, in his veto message, the famously anti-Washington pol said the issue needed more discussion “with other states and even the federal government...”)  So determined Republican legislators stuck the narrow provision into a big, must-pass budget bill, which the Governor had little choice but to sign in July. They did that despite the fact that Americans for Tax Reform labeled it a  tax increase and violation of its Taxpayer Protection Pledge. (Perry, 6 of 31 members of the Texas Senate and 66 of 150 members of the Texas State House have signed the pledge, according to ATR.)
One key here:  As in California, Amazon made its jobs bid late in the game---as opposed to quietly extracting promises from outgoing office holders and then later demanding that their successors honor those promises.  In 2010, the Texas Comptroller sent Amazon a bill for $269 million for four years of back sales taxes, based on the presence of a small Amazon warehouse in the state and on existing state law, which already required a business to collect sales tax if it operates an in-state facility “directly, or indirectly or through a subsidiary or agent by whatever name, an office, place of distribution, sales or sample room or place, warehouse, storage place, or any other place of business.” (Amazon is fighting the bill and argues the law doesn’t apply because its warehouse is run by an “affiliate, but not subsidiary, of the Amazon retailing entity”.)  According to a blow by blow account by Billy Hamilton, a former Texas Deputy Controller turned tax consultant, it wasn’t until a conference committee report on the big budget bill included the provision in June, that Amazon began circulating an offer for 5,000 and later 6,000 new jobs in return for a 4 ½ year delay in the new law---similar to the deal South Carolina accepted. (Hamilton’s analysis is available only to subscribers of State Tax Notes.)
In addition, the Texas provision, drafted by Rep. John Otto, a Republican who is the vice chair of the Texas House’s tax-writing committee,  wasn’t the sort of broad “click-through” legislation that legislatures in Arkansas (Wal-Mart’s home turf) and the Democratic strongholds of California, Connecticut and Illinois have adopted this year. Those laws are modeled on one adopted by New York in 2008, which presumes Internet sellers have nexus if they have marketing deals with “affiliate” sellers who steer customers to Amazon through links on their own web sites and get a marketing fee for those sales. Instead, Otto stuck to the notion of bricks and mortar nexus, while making clear that Amazon can’t escape collecting tax simply by holding its warehouses in a related subsidiary.  That’s why Amazon hasn’t jettisoned all its marketing affiliates in Texas, as it has in the other states. (In New York, Amazon kept its affiliates and started collecting tax, but has been challenging the law in court, so far unsuccessfully.)
So will Amazon’s jobs bid work in the California? No and sort of. Based on the cool response Democratic Governor Jerry Brown and Democratic legislative leaders gave the offer--local reports here and here --Amazon is unlikely to be able to cut a deal, meaning it won't start building warehouses in California. So it will have to continue to use neighboring states as a staging ground. (More job rewards: Soon after an Arizona House rules committee killed a New York style Amazon tax in April, Amazon put out a news release praising state officials and announcing the expansion of a Phoenix area warehouse. And in July, it announced a fourth Arizona warehouse. It also has centers in Nevada to serve California.)

Yet striking a deal with Democrats is not the only way Amazon can buy itself more tax-collection-free time in California.  Amazon’s bid may make it harder for backers of the new tax to push through the legislature a separate measure (which requires a two-thirds vote and hence some Republican support) which would block a voter referendum repealing the new Internet tax nexus law.
Amazon has already sunk $5.25 million into the More Jobs Not Taxes “coalition” and has been collecting the half million signatures it needs to get the repeal referendum on the ballot for June 2012.  Once the signatures are certified, the law will be suspended until the vote. Moreover, it could pass.  A July poll conducted by USC and the L.A. Times found state votes fairly evenly split, with 49% opposing and 46% approving of forcing internet merchants to collect tax.
Note that while Amazon has dismissed its California marketing affiliates, the new law (like the one in Texas) also requires Internet merchants with related subsidiaries in the state to collect sales tax.  (Bill analysis  here.) Amazon has three units operating in California, including the lab that developed the Kindel. So it can’t just, having gotten rid of the affiliates,  pretend it doesn’t apply.
Another question about Amazon’s strategy is raised by story in today's New York Times reporting how irate Democrats, including  California treasurer Bill Lockyer are now refusing to shop at Amazon. The company is  obviously less susceptible to politically inspired boycotts than a bricks and mortar retailer would be---you’ll never have to elbow by a screaming, sign waving picket to shop at Amazon. But at some point, any dominant company has to start worrying a little about a perception that its unfairly throwing its weight around and making up its own rules of play.  Just ask Google (or Microsoft earlier) about that.
Bottom line: I still think that Amazon’s days of selling tax free in the U.S. are numbered. So too does retail analyst David Strasser, a managing director at Janney Montgomery Scott. He points to Amazon’s willingness to cut a deal with California in return for just a few years of relief. “The tide is changing, and a more reasonable tax code is closer to fruition,’’ he writes in an email.
Still, you just gotta love Amazon’s chutzpah. Too bad it doesn’t sell alcohol. I’d order up a bottle on my Amazon Prime account and drink a toast.

SAN ANTONIO -- Sept. 11 commemorative services are somber but important at Wagner High School.When it opened in 2005, it was named after Lt. Col. Karen Wagner, who died during the attack on the Pentagon.On Friday, the entire school met in the school gymnasium to honor Wagner in a special ceremony.Most high school seniors were only  6 or 7 years old when the attacks took place but many of them said they do remember that day..Shannon Hladik, a 16-year-old senior, was 6 at the time. She said, "I remember just a feeling of almost, you know, panic."Some students said they recall being pulled out of school but didn't understand why.Jarrett Battistini, a 17-year-old senior, said, "My mom didn't tell me back then. I think I was too young to be told. She told me later and I knew something bad had happened but I didn't understand. I knew that something bad had happened but I didn't understand the magnitude of what had occurred. ""As a little kid I wasn't sure quite what was going on but I knew that something happened and something was wrong," said HladikOn that day, many students said they experienced a new kind of fear.Janaevia Broussard, a 17-years-old senior, said, "From that day on, like, I was always scared because my mom was in the military so I was scared to see her, you know, go off to work every day. I was terrified for awhile and I didn't want for her to be in the military anymore."A lot of healing has taken place over the past 10 years.Janaevai said she now plans to join the military when she graduates."I'm very thankful for those people who give their lives for us and I'm very appreciative and I love what the military stands for," she said.And school officials are also encouraging healing.  The principal said this will be the last year the school will hold a memorial service for 9/11.  IInstead, starting next year, they plan to hold celebrations in honor of the school's namesake.

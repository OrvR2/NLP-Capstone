				The best smell in the entire world is a roasting batch of Hatch green chiles. We just roasted some hot (they come in various heat strengths, world), and they are excellent this year. We have an extra freezer just to store the roasted chiles to eat all year round. Can't wait for winter and lots of green chile stew -- that'll warm 'ya up.

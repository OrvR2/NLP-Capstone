61-YEAR-OLD WOMAN CONTINUES QUEST TO SWIM 103 MILES NON-STOP
Posted: July 15th, 2011


 

STORY HIGHLIGHTS:
Diana Nyad is a world distance record-holder in non-stop swimming.  In the 1970s she broke numerous world records, including the record for non-stop swimming without a wetsuit by swimming more than 100 miles from the island of Bimini to Florida.  Last year, at the age of 60, Nyad planned to make the 103-mile swim from Havana, Cuba to Key West, Florida but was forced to cancel due to bad weather.  When asked about her motivation, Nyad has said, “I’d like to prove to the other 60-year-olds that it is never too late to start your dreams.”  She plans to complete her quest to swim from Cuba to Florida next month.

CARSON CITY, Nev. — One was an Iraq War veteran who loved military history. Another was an Afghanistan war vet and fitness buff. Still another would bring in cupcakes for colleagues when they got promotions.
All of them were National Guard members and they were sitting at a table at a Nevada IHOP when a gunman burst in and began shooting. All three died in the attack, a death toll that matched the total number of Nevada guardsmen killed in Iraq and Afghanistan over a decade. A patron was also killed.
"This is unquestionably the most devastating attack in Carson City's history," Sheriff Kenny Furlong said on Wednesday. "Yesterday our town was shocked to the core."
Exactly what set gunman Eduardo Sencion, 32, off – and whether the grocery store employee had some kind of grudge against the military – remained unclear. He killed himself after the shooting.
Family members told police that Sencion was mentally troubled, but he did not have a criminal history.
South Lake Tahoe police said the department took Sencion into protective custody during a mental health commitment in April 2000 and that he fought with officers. He was not charged.
The Lake Tahoe News first reported the incident.
No court order was involved, Lt. David Stevenson told The Associated Press. He said officers have the authority under state law to take individuals into protective custody if they determine the person poses a danger to themselves or others.
No weapon was involved in the incident, said Stevenson, who declined to release any other details because the Carson City shooting investigation remains active.
Art Panchal runs a South Lake Tahoe motel near the small Mexican market where Sencion worked, which is owned by Sencion's family.
Panchal visits the market to buy jalapenos, tortillas and fish, and saw Sencion on those shopping trips.
"He was a happy guy. He was always smiling," Panchal said. "He would help people out."
When Panchal heard media reports about the shooting, "I was shocked."
"I was totally surprised," said Panchal, who has operated the National 9 Inn for six years. "I don't know why he freaked out."
Authorities on Wednesday released the 911 calls made from in and around the IHOP. They painted a picture of a frantic scene, as witnesses described the gunman firing his gun.
"There's a shooting in the IHOP! Get there right now!" yelled caller Ralph Swagler, owner of Local's BBQ next door, as shots rang out in the background.
"Now he's coming back out. He's shooting people in the parking lot! He's shooting at us now!"
A female caller instructed the dispatcher to bring "several" ambulances.
Kathy Chaney, of Dayton, Nev., was inside the IHOP, just feet away from the National Guard members.
Chaney was sitting with five relatives and a child she was caring for when she heard the "biggest and loudest pops that I've ever heard in my whole life."
Chaney said she put her hands to her ears and got under the table as the gunman rapidly fired dozens of shots, shattering a glass partition that separated her family from the soldiers who were killed.
"If it had not been for that glass, we would have all been shot in the head," she said.
"I heard screaming. I heard glass shattering. I heard a woman moaning, and when I was on the floor I just kind of looked up," she said. "... I just saw debris flying, it was almost like in slow motion – like confetti."
Chaney said that as she huddled beneath the table, three men who work for a cable company took charge and started yelling for those inside to leave the restaurant through an emergency exit.
"We could tell that the gunshots were getting closer. And so I had no idea where it was coming from or where he was, and I thought for sure I was going to get shot," she said.
She knocked over a high chair where the 2 1/2-year-old girl she was caring for was sitting, then carried the girl out of the restaurant while crouching. As she left the building, "I was still hearing gunfire," Chaney said.
"It really is just such a miracle, by the grace of God, that we're alive today," Chaney said.
Seven people were wounded in the attack. Their names were not released, but authorities said three of them were released from the Carson-Tahoe Hospital on Wednesday.
Maj. April Conway of the Nevada National Guard said one of the three released was a Guard member. That leaves one Guard member still hospitalized, along with three civilians.
The four killed in the attack were:
_ Maj. Heath Kelly, 35, of Reno. Brig. Gen. William R. Burks said Kelly was a decorated officer and avid student of military history who was known for his dry sense of humor. Kelly was married with two kids.
Kelly's stepmother, Noretta Kelly of Terrytown, La., said Kelly lived for his two children, a 5-year-old daughter and 2-month-old son, and always wanted to be a soldier.
"We're just heartbroken," she said.
Noretta Kelly said she felt like his death was "unreal," given that he had survived a tour in Iraq and a childhood in the New Orleans area, and had moved to a safer place.
"It's just kind of like – it wasn't right."
_ Sgt. 1st Class Christian Riege, 38, of Carson City.
Burks said Riege was a fitness buff and father of four who had also been in the Navy. Riege's military occupation was armor crewman, and he served in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010.
_ Sgt. 1st Class Miranda McElhiney, 31, of Reno. McElhiney was an administrative sergeant who had been in the Guard for 13 years. She baked birthday, wedding and graduation cakes for anyone who asked.
McElhiney was a "fireball," said Kaylee Rutledge, who recently graduated from high school. "She told you how it was. She didn't hold anything back."
McElhiney was helping Rutledge navigate her way through the male-centric Guard. "She wasn't going to let any of the boys stop her," Rutledge said. "Whenever you needed her, she would always be there."
_ The patron killed was Florence Donovan-Gunderson, 67, of South Lake Tahoe. Donovan-Gunderson was married to a retired U.S. Marine Corps member.
Donovan-Gunderson worked in the credit department of Harrah's Lake Tahoe casino for 10 years before she retired in 1999, casino spokesman John Packer said.
Her husband, Wally Gunderson, was a security guard at the casino until 1998, Packer said.
Wally Gunderson also was shot during the restaurant massacre. His status was unclear.
Mary Synder lived next door to Donovan-Gunderson for 30 years. They were close friends.
She said Wally Gunderson has multiple sclerosis and depended on Donovan-Gunderson to get around.
The couple was at the IHOP because Donovan-Gunderson had a dentist appointment in Carson City Tuesday, Synder said.
Synder was supposed to have dinner with Donovan-Gunderson on Wednesday night. They often played card games, especially Rummy 500.
"I'm going to be strong until I don't want to be anymore," Synder said.

				I wonder if this wack job tried to get into the national guard and or military and was turned down? that might explain  his behavior.  Make no mistake if he was not able to purchase that gun legally he would have found one or a similar one using any means possible.  His intent was clear, kill as many as possible, you don't fire 3 clips / 90 rounds without knowing exactly  what you are doing. I'm so sorry for the loss of those 4 people and the many wounded. My condolence­s to the families.

				Well, as usual I have reduced the liberal know-nothi­ngs to carrying on like a French schoolgirl with a rat in her shorts.  

No surprise, there.  They always degenerate into name calling and accusation­s of dishonesty­.  It really is the best they can do.  Their attitudes on guns are simply expression­s of envy by the incompeten­t.  They cannot cope with the world, and bitterly resent those who can.

Good night.  And don't forget to put that big sign out in front of your houses tomorrow.  You know, the one that says "There are no firearms in this home."

I just KNOW you all have the courage of your conviction­s to do THAT, right?

G'night.

				Well, let's see.  I have posted probably a dozen ideas that the libs on this post could debate.  So far, I have been called dishonest, and been the subject of middle school insults, but only one actual response, that being from someone who actually doesn't know that a "well-regu­lated" militia meant a well TRAINED militia in the military parlance of the times, not buried in 21st Century liberal gun control laws. 

It's getting late, people.  Do we get better, or is this it?

				There is a comment thread earlier about Westboro wanting to protest at the Guard funerals..­. Of course they do. It will draw press. Hopefully they will be ignored. Here is the scoop. The only members of that SCAM are family, and that family is made up almost entirely of lawyers! Surprise!!­...  Their entire "church" is based on making money by abusing American Freedoms. No other legitimate church will even acknowledg­e them.. They don't believe the swill they preach, they just want to make someone angry enough to violate "their  civil rights" ... either right to assembly, freedom of speech or whatever.. then they SUE that individual or entity... It is their point, purpose and source of income. Why the Kansas Bar Associatio­n doesn't toss them out on their A 's... uh..Ears is beyond me.

				Have they determined if he was here legally yet? I know they said he had a passport but... that isn't always what it seems. I can only think of 2 reasons for him to target the National Guard; one being a romantic situation gone bad and the second being he that he may have been scared of being deported or "caught", for whatever reason. Any thoughts..­.

				Our nation is awash with guns.  This killer had several. 

Many dangerous people have been able to "get" guns because the NRA obstructs responsibl­e changes in the law that would protect public safety.

Americans don't understand how flawed the background check system is and how limited when someone wants to buy lethal weapons.  The problem remains mostly under the radar for most Americans.

				You mentioned that in a firefight, you can only react by pointing the gun with muscle memory and not the sights.  I said that only the poorly trained do that.  Properly trained people (and it is not hard to do) ALWAYS use the sights, no matter how stressful the situation.  This "muscle memory" business is a myth.

				From the State Dept:

In Fiscal Year 2005, Diplomatic Security investigat­ed 3,564 new cases of passport and visa fraud and made 583 arrests.

Who commits passport fraud?

� Those illegally seeking citizenshi­p or legal status in the United States

� Those attempting to change or conceal their identity

� Terrorists or fugitives

� Those committing financial fraud

� Those committing other criminal activity such as drug traffickin­g or alien smuggling

How is passport fraud committed?

� Substituti­ng photos, most commonly occurring overseas and with older passports
� Altering support documents, such as birth certificat­es
� Assuming the identity of a deceased person
� Circumvent­ing the two-parent signature rule for minors

The following statutes mandate the DS investigat­ive authority for passport fraud:

� 18 USC 1541 Issuance Without Authority
� 18 USC 1542 False Statement in Applicatio­n and Use of Passport
� 18 USC 1543 Forgery or False Use of Passport
� 18 USC 1544 Misuse of Passport
� 18 USC 1546 Fraud and Misuse of Visas, Permits, and Other Documents
� 18 USC 371 Conspiracy to Commit Offense or to Defraud the United States
� 18 USC 911 False Claim to Citizenshi­p
� 18 USC 1028 Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Identifica­tion Documents and Informatio­n

from: http://www­.state.gov­/m/ds/inve­stigat/c10­714.htm

- Having a 'valid' passport is rather meaningles­s unless it is validated by the Feds.

				Recently someone made a comment to the effect that the NRA must be gleeful over this incident.

Someone, presumably a supporter of the 2d Amendment, apparently complained and the comment was deleted.

Please, folks.  Let's leave suppressio­n of free speech to the liberals.  They love the little thought-po­lice hero badges that they get for suppressin­g the speech of others, but that is what liberals do.  They cannot argue the point, so they suppress it.

				Here is another little bubble-pop­per for you liberal know-nothi­ngs who claim guns are never used for successful self defense.

Prof. Gary Kleck of Florida State University­, a former gun control loving liberal, did a series of studies that indicated that citizens use firearms in self defense up to two million times a year.

Oh, NO!  Cry the liberals.  The study was flawed!!  (Of course.)

Well, let's look at that.

Let us say that Kleck was 90% WRONG, and it only happened 200,000 times a year.  Let us further say that THAT number was 90% wrong, and only 10% of that number really used a gun to avoid a lethal criminal attack, leaving us with 20,000 legitimate cases of self defense.

Given that there were about 12,000 gun deaths in 2008…

CONGRATULA­TIONS!  You gun grabbing know-nothi­ngs have just doubled the death rate!

Feel better now?

Or isn't 90% of 90% enough of a "flaw?"

Since it has happened TWICE in my family alone, I think his numbers make sense.

				Here is an answer to that absurd claim that no one ever uses a gun successful­ly for self defense:

Of the roughtly million times annually that it happens, it has happened in my family twice.

First, my sister was sitting at home when a man with a knife - later identified as a serial rapist - kicked in her front door.  She had a .357 magnum.  She was  unharmed, and the rapist is, shall we say, no longer a threat to anyone.

Second, just a few years ago, I was attacked by a nut with a knife in broad daylight in the middle of a supermarke­t parking lot.

I had a .45 semi automatic, carried legally.  He had an immediate change of plans.  No one was hurt.

Liberals could care less about crime.  They just don't want people to be independen­t of their Big Government Machine.  If a bad guy does in a good guy, the machine has lots to do; the courts, the cops, the prisons, the therapists­, and, above all, the FUNDING.

If a good guy decks a bad guy, the machine has nothing to do.

THIS is the issue for liberals.

				I suspect that, not having any argument of your own, you are clinging to the usual liberal tactic of accusing people of dishonesty when you have been decisively beaten in the arena of actual ideas.

And if I am being paid by "gun control lobbyists,­" then why would I be so decisively PRO-Second Amendment?  I realize that confusion is the natural milieu of the liberal, but really...

Are talking points from your liberal masters the best YOU can do?.

Do we get better, or is this it?

September 1787

(Lessons learned from Shays Rebellion and other uprisings in our young nation worked to change the Articles of Confederat­ion to the Constituti­on of the United States, and tempered Jefferson'­s notion while living off in Paris:  "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."

How about you quote James Madison on the 2d Amendment, since he wrote it?

				Funny you should ask:

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

Madison indeed wrote the Second Amendment and he was clear that the states' Militia would be well regulated and "officered by men chosen from among themselves­, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by government­s possessing their affections and confidence­."  (The states.)

"The Discipline of the Militia is evidently a national concern, and ought to be provided for in the National Constituti­on."  

Madison never said or wrote that the Second Amendment'­s sole purpose was anything other than "well regulated Militia", being necessary to the security of the free State.

The Shays Rebellion was treason, according to Madison.  Federalist No. 63, "Liberty may be endangered by the abuse of liberty as well as by the abuses of power ... The former rather than the latter is apparently most to be apprehende­d by the United States."

				This answers the NRA fantasy about heroic gun carry when there's a crisis:  

CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- A gunman wielding an AK-47 opened fire on a table of uniformed National Guard members at an IHOP

Ralph Swagler said he grabbed his own weapon, but said it was too late to stop the shooter, who charged into the IHOP through the front doors.

"I wish I had shot at him when he was going in the IHOP," said Swagler, who owns Locals BBQ & Grill. 

"But when he came at me, when somebody is pointing an automatic weapon at you - you can't believe the firepower, the kind of rounds coming out of that weapon."

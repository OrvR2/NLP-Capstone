Feb. 23, 2011 — HUNT, Texas — Residents in Kerr County interested in learning how to protect themselves from wildfire are invited to a town hall meeting on March 5.The gathering is set for 10 a.m. at Hunt Methodist Church, 120 Merritt Road, Hunt. Representatives from Texas Forest Service will be on hand to answer questions and talk about what you can do to protect your home and family from wildfire. For example, you can reduce potential wildfire losses by adopting Firewise landscaping practices 100 to 200 feet around your home. That includes moving firewood and clearing dead and dense vegetation.Wildland Urban Interface Specialist Jan Fulkerson stressed that wildfires are a community-wide problem, which means reducing risks to homes and property is everyone’s responsibility.“More than 80 percent of wildfires in Texas occur within 2 miles of a community,” Fulkerson said, reminding residents that wildfires have raged through Kerr County before and likely will again. “We want to encourage residents to take proactive measures that could end up saving lives and property.”The town hall meeting is hosted by Hunt Volunteer Fire Department, Canyon Springs Firewise and the Hunt Methodist Church.For more information, visit www.texasfirewise.org.

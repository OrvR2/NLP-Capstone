Upgrade Your Life:  The 5 worst photos to post onlineBy Taylor Hatmaker, Tecca | Upgrade Your Life – Tue, Sep 6, 2011



﻿﻿
With  online networks steering our social lives these days, deciding exactly  how to represent ourselves on the web can be tricky. This episode of  Upgrade Your Life addresses 5 kinds of photos you should avoid putting  online — and why.
1. Don't post pictures  showing personal data
Even  if your Twitter account is private and you closely monitor who sees what on your  Facebook profile, personal data revealed in  photos isn't necessarily safe. Strangers and hackers aren't the only  threat; people you know can steal your identity, too. And according to a  study conducted by the Javelin Strategy and Research group, they are with increasing frequency, thanks to social media.  According to Javelin's 2010 Identity Fraud Survey,  people between the ages of 18 to 24 were especially prone to this kind  of identity theft, likely due to their high level of engagement with  social networking websites.
By  2011, this demographic had shifted to the 25- to  34 age group who are now the most likely victims of so-called "friendly  fraud. Older Americans are the least likely to secure their social  media accounts, which also puts them at high risk for identity theft at  the hands of friends and acquaintances.
*  Don't post any images with any identifying information whatsoever. No  driver's licenses, marriage certificates, leases, or passports. You may  think that's obvious, but do an image search and you'll see plenty of  newly married couples, proud teen drivers, and world travelers posting  high resolution pics of their documents.
*  Even if you think your photos are private, more people might be able to  see them than you think. On Facebook, friends of friends might be able  to see photos tagged of you, if the photo's owner has the setting  enabled. Facebook's photo settings are notoriously complex, so err on the side of caution and untag  photos when necessary.
2.  Disable location services and geotagging
Cameras  are increasingly sophisticated — even the ones built into our phones. As you snap  pictures, many cameras record information called EXIF data or metadata, including the camera's  make & model, settings like speed and aperture, and the time the  photo was taken.  While much of this is helpful, it's just good for you  to know you may be posting this info with a photo. Probably the biggest  issue with embedded photo data is geotagging: when a GPS-enabled camera,  memory card, or cell phone camera pinpoints your exact location in the  metadata — even without your knowledge. Some social networking services  strip that data out, but others include it — which mean you've  essentially posted your home address online for anyone who knows how to  view the geotagging data.
If  your device includes this geodata as the default option, you'll need to  disable it in your settings. If you're working with a point-and-shoot  camera or a DSLR, you can find this through the settings menu on your  camera — just look for a menu mentioning "geotagging," "location" or  "geodata" and to be sure the feature isn't enabled.
Turn  off geotagging on Android and iPhone
To  disable geotagging on an Android device, open the camera app and be sure the "geo-tag photos" box in the  settings menu is unchecked. On an iPhone,  hit the settings icon, click on "location services" from the menu, find  "Camera" and move the slider from On to Off.
3.  Incriminating photos
As  social networks skyrocket in popularity, employers are increasingly  hopping on the web to research potential new hires. Many businesses  search the web for information about their prospective or current employees. Now, background checking companies like Social Intelligence Corp. have capitalized on this kind of job  vetting. The FTC recently ruled that such companies can store your  long-deleted online indiscretions for up to 7 years. And since 47% of Facebook walls contain content that  could be deemed profane, that fact is relevant to a lot of us.
*  Resist the urge to post "party photos" on social networks. And yes that  means no pics with the red keg cup in hand, even if you were only  drinking water.
* Keep the way you'd like to be perceived  professionally in mind when choosing a profile picture.
*  If friends tag you in an incriminating Facebook photo, a recent privacy overhaul means you can  approve or disapprove the tag, which will keep it from showing up on  your profile page. Keep in mind this new feature is limited, so those  photos can still pop up elsewhere on Facebook.

4.  Cut out poorly cropped photos
While  it's no security risk, there's little reason to choose Facebook profile  photo with a stray arm or shoulder in it. If you're looking to meet  people online on a dating site or social network, make the effort to  choose a profile that features you, without the distraction of half of  someone else in the picture. That someone else could distract anyone who  looks at your profile — who is it? Where was it taken? Is that your ex?  But keeping the focus on you is easy, thanks to free apps.
Improve  your photos with these free tools
Photos editing  services like Picnik, and DrPic, can make cropping a  snap. There's no need to use Microsoft Paint to edit a photo — if you  need to tinker around with a shot, use one of these free services.
And  pick an interesting one — according to stats from OKCupid, one of the web's  most popular dating sites, you'll be far more likely to strike up a  conversation with a potential match if your photo shows you doing  something interesting, like playing the guitar or scuba diving.
5.  Avoid webcam profile photos
There  are a range of great, cheap, easy-to-use cameras out there, which means  something better than your computer's built-in or external webcam is  often at hand. Even cameraphones often boast 5 megapixels or more, which  can easily eclipse the photo quality of a webcam, even on new  computers. Since many webcams are optimized for video, the photo quality  deteriorates when it comes to still images. Apple's new FaceTime cameras, found on the iPad 2,  the MacBook Air, and other devices  are one example of this. These cameras make moving pictures look great,  but your still shot may be grainy and blurred.
How  to improve your self-portraits
To get a good shot of  yourself, you're better off using any kind of point-and-shoot camera, a  DSLR for the best image quality, or even your phone. Since you can  potentially find a tripod for each of these devices (check out GorillaMobile for your phone), set  up your shot in advance so it will be well-framed and well-lit.
For  a flattering outdoor photo, avoid the high-noon sun. Instead either  take your own photo — or better yet, recruit a friend's help — during  the early morning and late afternoon hours, when photographers are known  to capture the best kind of light for portraits.

This woman just used this as a #$%$ soap box at the end. The first part of the show was common sense but the so called "boring photos" that's her opinion and should not be part of this broadcast.

if you're hot, it's generally better to be naked in your pictures. men like naked hot chicks, so this will give you a big advantage if you're looking for a job

Check my facebook, check my credit score (yeah, its terrible), and drug test me all you want... I'll find a way around it. There is always something new to block us from success, but the those of us who truly want something will find a way. I am living my life and I have nothing to apologize for and nothing to be ashamed of.

I feel sorry for the kids today. As if the job market wasn't bad enough, now everyone has to have a credit score busting 750. Your private life (if you can call facebook private) is factored into your job. Companies deny you employment if you smoke. Some places keep you under surveillance at work. And, to top it off, applications are just about all done online. Cripe, you can't even get any face time to talk with a potential employer.
When I was starting out, you could walk into a business, talk to the boss, he'd decide if you could do the job and say yes or no. It really was less complicated back then.

My best friend ,she just has announced her wedding with a millionaire man! They met via SearchⱤichṢingles.CȯṀ ..it is the largest and best club for millionaires and their admirers to chat online. …You do not have to be rich or famous, but you may meet one. It's worth a try!

well, the bengals have as nany superbowl rings as detroit. detroit has a much better team this year than the bengals. i am not a fan of either team, but, i think the bengals need to shut the pie hole. are there really season ticket holders for the bengals? that is sad

This article is written by an idiot for stupid people. The author thanks to social media in the article. Social media is the biggest culprit and the whole problem on the net. All social networks steal identity and personal information.

Ex-deputy accused of kidnapping faced harrassment probe in '97

Agustin Rubio




  
A deputy constable who recently resigned after being charged with felony kidnapping was under criminal investigation more than a decade ago when he quit his job at the Bryan school district, The Eagle has learned. 
Agustin Rubio never was charged in connection with the 1997 inquiry at BISD, but 14 years later that case could come under review again.
Last week, he resigned from his law enforcement job with Precinct 2 -- nine days after he was placed on paid administrative leave pending an inquiry into an Aug. 28 incident involving a woman attending a party in the area of Deacon Drive and Fraternity Row. 
According to a police report, Rubio, who was working an off-duty security job at a fraternity party that evening, was seen by a College Station officer placing a woman in handcuffs and into the back of his patrol car just before 2 o'clock on that Sunday morning. 
Minutes later, according to the report, video surveillance footage shows Rubio's patrol cruiser entering a parking lot less than a mile away, and leaving the lot 15 minutes later. 
The woman woke up in the parking lot just before 6 a.m. and called her parents, who already were in contact with authorities. The woman's friends told the parents hours earlier that they saw the woman being taken away in a patrol car and assumed she was going to jail, authorities said. 
College Station police opened an investigation, and three days later Rubio was arrested on the kidnapping charge. He was released from jail hours later after posting $10,000 bail for the third-degree felony charge. Authorities say the inquiry still is ongoing.
It wasn't clear if police were looking into that report made in 1997 while Rubio was working for the Bryan school district as a campus monitor at Lamar, which was a ninth-grade campus at the time, spokeswoman Sandy Farris said. 
He was hired Aug. 14, 1995, and resigned Feb. 28, 1997 -- eight days after a probe was launched by Bryan police into a report from a student that he had sexually harassed her, Farris said. He was placed on paid suspension on Feb. 20, Farris said, adding that a criminal background check was performed prior to Rubio's hiring, and no reason was found to bar him from employment with the district.
Bryan Officer Jon Agnew confirmed an investigation involving Rubio began Feb. 20, 1997, but he could not comment on when the investigation was closed or what potential offenses were investigated. 
He said that no criminal charges were filed.
Precinct 2 Constable Donald Lampo said Rubio worked for him for a decade and he never heard a complaint about the officer during that time. Lampo said Rubio's references were checked prior to his hiring and no reason was found not to employ him as a deputy constable. 
Rubio also previously worked as a jailer for the Brazos County Sheriff's Department for a six-month period in 1994, Sheriff Chris Kirk said. 
Attempts to contact Rubio at home were unsuccessful. Greg Cagle, an attorney assigned to represent him through the Texas Municipal Police Association, said he tried to reach Rubio Tuesday, but had not heard back from him by the end of the workday.

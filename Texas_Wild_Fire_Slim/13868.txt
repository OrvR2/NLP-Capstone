We're taking bets: Is it for real this time?

(Newser) -
                                    The  18-month storybook romance  of Cameron Diaz and Alex Rodriguez has come to an end. They've simply got no time for love, a source explains to  Us : "She's very busy with her career, and he's had injuries and wants to focus on his game. They're...

Michaele Salahi Abducted, Says Tareq
And police aren't taking him seriously, he tells TMZ

(Newser) -
                                    Now this is bizarre: Tareq Salahi has reached out to  TMZ  because he thinks wife Michaele has been the victim of a publicity stunt, er, kidnapping. Salahi, who is of course famous for  crashing a White House dinner with his wife  and then moving on to a stint on Real ...

But three years later, life has 'repaired itself'

(Newser) -
                                    When Heath Ledger died, "it felt like we didn’t have anything," Michelle Williams recalls in a new  Vogue  cover story.

On Keira Knightley: 'Well, she's thin.'

(Newser) -
                                    Apparently there's not a lot of love lost between Joan Collins and her fellow celebrities. In an interview with the  Telegraph  to promote her new book, The World According to Joan, the former Dynasty star was asked about:   Kate Winslet: On one of her outfits at the Venice Film ...

Anderson Gets Spray Tanned With Snooki
Yes, viewers at home, he does take off his shirt

(Newser) -
                                    Anderson Cooper, who has  braved angry mobs  in Egypt,  faced potential radiation poisoning  in Japan, and  rescued a bloodied child  in Haiti, shows a decidedly less hard-hitting side on his  new daytime show . Case in point: On the second episode of Anderson yesterday, Coop went for a spray tan with—...

                                    The Guinness Book of World Records is not just for regular joes who go on epic  bar crawls  or  paddleboard rides .

Jon Stewart Slams CNN's 'Amerigasm'
Was that a debate, or a reality show?

(Newser) -
                                    Monday night's GOP debate started off in "fine reality show style," noted Jon Stewart  last night , offering up as proof a clip of CNN's opening, in which the network actually assigned each candidate a title. (Mitt Romney is "the early frontrunner," Rick Perry "...

Gaga Flashes Photogs ... Er, What Was That?
Gawker stumped

(Newser) -
                                    The great Gaga  mystery continues . The too-much singer flashed photogs when her slitted dress slitted a bit too much, gushes the  New York Daily News , which spotted a piercing on the underwear-less Gaga. But  Gawker  was left wondering what exactly that was between Gaga's legs. The News blurred the...

14 Most Bizarre Celebrity Pregnancy Cravings
Bananas and ketchup ... yum?

(Newser) -
                                    More proof celebrities are just like us: They get weird pregnancy food cravings, too. The  Sun  reports that Beyonce is already hankering for some pretty weird combinations, which, perhaps too predictably, include pickles. "She's snacking on Oreo biscuits and gherkins," says a source. Also, "Bounty ice...

Madonna Bursts Into Song, Gives Critics Instructions
And calls King Edward VIII 'very punk rock'

(Newser) -
                                    Madonna doesn’t mind criticism of her new movie, WE—a good thing,  since it bombed  at the Venice Film Festival and,  Reuters  notes, subsequently received a one-star review in the Guardian—as long as that criticism is directed at the movie, and not at the Material Girl. "I...

                                    On Sunday, America remembered the 10th anniversary of September 11, 2001, but  last night,  Jon Stewart reminded us that there’s another important date to commemorate: September 13, 2001. After all, that was the day Jerry Falwell said that “the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the...

Madonna Posts Cheeky Video Ode to Hydrangeas
Material Girl responds to flower brouhaha

(Newser) -
                                    Nope, Madonna still doesn’t like hydrangeas, a fact she makes abundantly clear in a new video posted on her official  YouTube  channel. Though titled "Madonna’s love letter to hydrangeas"—and beginning with an apparent apology to the flower  she dissed last week —the video quickly...

(Newser) -
                                    Eighteen months after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Spartacus TV star Andy Whitfield has died. He was 39. Spartacus: Blood and Sand was the Starz network's first big hit, thanks in large part to the program's plentiful violence and nudity.

Ricky Gervais Plots 'Alternative' Golden Globe Hosting
He'd take podcast potshots during broadcast in percolating plan

                                    Ricky Gervais won't shut up. Bashed after hosting the last Golden Globe Awards show for his  inappropriate comments  (which should have come as no surprise to anyone), the irreverent comedian is considering being an underground podcast host next time around. That's the gist of his latest blogs as...

Charlie Sheen Gets Roasted
Comedy Central fetes actor with raunchy roast

(Newser) -
                                    Charlie Sheen probably needs an intervention, but he got roasted instead last night on Comedy Central. Celebs roasters included William Shatner, Seth MacFarlane, Mike Tyson, Jon Lovitz, and Patrice O'Neal, and the  Huffington Post  has a rundown of the best zingers from the raunchfest:   Shatner: "Never ever forget ...

Cyndi Lauper Flubs Anthem at US Open
Ceremony marred by Lauper's unforced error

(Newser) -
                                    This time, apparently the Goonies weren't good enough. Singer Cyndi Lauper flubbed the national anthem at the US Open women's semifinals, in a ceremony honoring 9/11 victims. After a moment of silence, and as an honor guard marched, Lauper did a mash-up of lines from the anthem, changing...

Alec Baldwin Bashes Lowly Starbucks Barista
...who may not exist

(Newser) -
                                    Alec Baldwin is not a man known for his cool temper, which makes it only slightly surprising that he went on a Twitter rant on Wednesday. The weird twist? It was directed at a possibly non-existent Starbucks employee. "Starbucks on 93 and B’way. Uptight Queen barrista [sic] named...

					Oh, Happy Friday!				






It’s been a heck of a week… and that is putting it tamely. (Gotta keep it rated G here, folks.) With all that has been going on, it is a great pleasure and fun distraction to share with you some of the Why we Love Austin postcards that have come in!
“I love Austin because of it’s diversity” … “I love Austin because it is a good place to relax” … “I love Austin, but not because of 6th Street” … “I love Austin because it is the pup capital of the world!”
We love getting your cards in the mail and seeing what you love about the fabulous city that we live! To participate, pick up a card from around town (they are everywhere, guys!), fill it out and mail it in (postage is already paid!!)! If in the event you cannot find a postcard, you can print one off here OR email photos/commentary to faithlovesaustintoo@yahoo.com.
Happy Friday, everyone!

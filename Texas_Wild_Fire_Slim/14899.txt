The Lions [...]

Caught up with the Rangers
I’m in danger of being considered a bandwagon fan. Well I’ll let you be the judge of that. Unlike many new Texas Ranger fans out there, I admit that whether or not the Rangers won or ever competed for a World Series was not one of my major concerns. Before moving to Ennis last July, [...]

Water rate boost in  the works
A city water rate increase foreshadowed during the summer’s budget-planning process has made it to the commission’s Monday agenda.

It was still dark outside as local World War II veterans gathered at the Waxahachie Civic Center to begin their journey as part of the 2010 Ellis County Honor Flight. Thirty local veterans were joined by 26 guardians for a trip that saw them travel to Washington, D.C. to visit many national memorials and landmarks [...]

Waxahachie squeaks past 9th Lion football, 28-22

Ennis (3-5-1, 2-4-1) made it all the way down to the Waxahachie 2 on the game’s final play in a 28-22 loss. While the Lions wanted nothing less than a victory, they showed great improvement from last [...]

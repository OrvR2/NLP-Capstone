Website Launch

Posted on April 7, 2011 by admin 

Today is our launch date. We are glad we have made it to today. Basically this site will be primarily to vindicate amoxicillin  President George W. Bush, the greatest president of modern times. We feel President Bush got a raw deal throughout his presidency.
Just one year into his term we get cytotec uses  hit with the largest terrorist attack in history. Then he gets dealt Katrina. One of the largest natural dissasters in modern history. Time and time again something happend, that wasn’t president Bush’s fault. That is the main reason we had to go into debt like we did.
Quick forward to todays president. President Obama drove us personally into record setting debt in under one year as president. President Obama Order Generic Propecia Online without Prescription  made numerous promises to his core voters that he has already broken, like Gitmo. He promised to close Gitmo in a year. It’s still open and he is trying the main terrorist in military tribunals, which he said he wouldn’t do. He is a liar!
I am glad Gitmo is still open. I am glad the terrorists are being tried by the military. I am glad Obama is failing as a president. He couldn’t run a playground, much less a country. No wonder these foreign countries want Obama to get re-elected. They want a weak America.

That is exactly what I have been saying for 8 years, and still to this day, another 2 years later.  President Bush was in Florida reading to children. An Aid pulled him aside explaining America is under attack.  President Bush is no chicken.  He acted asap flying back to DC.  All hell under attack, what do you do?  All the “american people” were behind him at ground zero, yelling “WAR, AMERICA IS COMING AFTER YOU.” Then what? Everybody stops. No war cries anymore, and then its, “what are we doing over there anyway?” All so called Americans disappeared.  Then again, natural disasters flagged the United States.  Since when was hurricanes the President’s fault? So just blame Bush for that too.  Idiots.  Natural disasters, attacks on American Soil, how many killed?  And nobody cared.  They all forgot.
President Bush never stood a chance from the beginning of his first term.  Trying to fix all Clinton’s screw-ups. Then, the bombing, the war- that EVERYBODY STOOD BEHIND HIM AT THE TIME, then forgot. Now we are stuck with a total idiot that does NOTHING FOR THIS COUNTRY. Using tax-payers money for extra long trips for vacation or sight-seeing.  Whatever.   The American people suck. But now, per FOX and CNN, 48% of the people NOW WISH oBAMA never got into office to start with.  Perhaps somebody is about to WAKE UP?????

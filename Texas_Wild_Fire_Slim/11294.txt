U.S. Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, today urged Texas Lt. Governor David Dewhurst and Texas Speaker of the House Joe Straus to call immediate hearings in the Texas Legislature on the impact to the state of Texas if the Big 12 Conference is disbanded.

Edwards announced this development in a news release, and said, "It is important that all the citizens of Texas have a right to have their voices heard on the future of the Big 12 before, not after, all the decisions have been made. These decisions are too important to be decided solely by a small handful of people behind closed doors without public input from the citizens of our great state.

"The Texas Legislature has a responsibility to our taxpayers to review the impact of any conference realignment on our state's economy and historic relationships between our state's universities and their respective communities."

Edwards is a 1974 graduate of Texas A&M University who represents both Baylor and Texas A&M in the 17th congressional district.

The higher ups in Austin were warned about what would happen if Baylor was left behind!

Edwards "These decisions are too important to be decided solely by a small handful of people behind closed doors without public input from the citizens of our great state." Really! Chet all I can say is wow, not to change the subject, but Chet, there are lot's of things going on in Washington that those of us were heard loud and clear. But yet members on both sides, have had deaf ears. Hey Chet, just vote present.

Chet Edwards and the government have much better things to do with their time than worry about college football. I have voted for Chet every single election but getting involved in sports may push me to the other side Mr. Edwards. why don't you and your political cronies worry more about GETTING OUR YOUNGEST SON HOME FROM BAGDAD!!!!!

As a Baylor alum I'm ashamed that pretty much our entire case to be included in a big league is "Pleeeeeeeease take us, pleeease!" But we're a relatively small potential audience, and we did ourselves no favors with our football performance in the Big 12. Pretty hard to argue against the decisions.

In My Opinion ...




Should Baylor sue if A&M leaves the Big 12?

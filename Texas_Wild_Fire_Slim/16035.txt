Many heroes emerged in the aftermath of September 11th, including dogs. 
Estimates suggest that hundreds of trained dogs and their handlers worked at 9/11 sites on search and rescue operations. 
According to a USA Today special by Sharon L. Peters, "No matter the calamity, natural or man-made, no matter the location, these animals that just hours earlier were, for the most part, romping in the yard with their families or chasing squirrels in the fields arrive on site in full-work mode and don't rest until ordered by their handlers to do so."
Reuters reports on one dog named Red, now 12 years old, who searched through rubble at the Pentagon in 12 hour shifts, spending weeks recovering bodies. 
While some oppose the use of animals for human purposes, particularly in warfare, most appreciate the heroism of these canines.
Below are photos of heroic canines over the years, from 9/11 searches to water lifeguarding to earthquake rescues. Take a moment to appreciate the four-legged heroes of the world. To learn about adopting a dog who needs a home, visit Petfinder.com.

In this 2000 photo provided by SICS (Scuola Italiana Cani Salvataggio-Italian School of Canine Lifeguards), lifeguard dogs of the Italian school perform a makeshift rescue operation at an international lifeguard meeting in Winterbach, Germany. Hundreds of specially trained dogs form Italy's corps of canine lifeguards, deployed each summer to help swimmers who get into trouble in the nation's popular seas. Unlike their human counterparts, these lifedogs can easily jump from helicopters and speeding boats to reach swimmers in need of a rescue. With millions flocking to Italy's crowded beaches each summer, the Italian Coast Guard says it rescues about 3,000 people every year _ and their canine helpers are credited with saving several lives.

				Our Politician­s could REALLY learn something about duty & self-sacri­fice from these service animals.

These service animals will provide their all, including their lives, for Humans... Too bad so many of our Politician­s haven't the same courage.

				Thank God for all the people and their wonderful canine companions who do this tiring and sometimes not very rewarding work. It has to be extremely hard on them all when they are unable to find survivors,­I can only imagine how draining and dangerous it is for both dog and human handler alike. not to mention all the harmful substances that the dog comes into contact with that can cause it to have severe health problems and shorten their already short life spans. My heart goes out to them all and makes my own dog all the more precious for what she has done for me.

				We just lost our lab to cancer this past week.  Before we took him to the vet that morning, I sat with him and and told him that he was our hero for bringing so much happiness and comfort in our lives. F*#! that was hard!  I think that dogs, and pets need to be thanked often because they are the ones that love us unconditio­nally.  Pets rule!

				I love these search and rescue dogs, and I appreciate their contributi­on to our safety and well being. Yet, at the same time I am disturbed by the increasing use of dogs for policing purposes at places like subways and airports. It just creates an almost nazi-like atmosphere of oppression­. Let's use our canine friends to protect people, not intimidate them.

				I can't even begin to tell you how much I love these 'dogs with jobs'... I literally gasped when I saw that there was a story on this.

I've seen the Beagle Patrol (Protectin­g the Farmers of America) at the airport in their little green coats. No smuggled salamis or stinky cheeses getting by their noses!

I'm really fascinated by the Italian lifeguard dogs. Amazing pics. The first pic of that one dog pulling nine other huge dogs in a raft by a rope! Or the one jumping out of a helicopter­! What? I had no idea they were doing this. 

They all do incredible work.

				The working breeds have always been my favorites - Shepherds, border collies, etc. - because nothing pleases them more than doing their job well. The dedication and devotion from these loyal creatures is so pure and absolute that sometimes it's easy to under-appr­eciate how much they really do.

				2 million horses mostly American Mustangs were sent to fight in WW1 only a few ever came back. They helped build this place and we thanked them by turning them into dog food. A woman fought for their protection and Congress listened to the will of the people and charged the BLM with their protection­. Unfortunat­ely as with everything else in this land the BLM caves to special interests and our living symbol of freedom is again being decimated for the greed of a few. Once gone it will be forever because 500 years of natural selection and survival of the fittest can never happen again. If this is how we treat the very living symbol of our freedom why should our mountain tops, air, waterways, or other symbols be treated any different?  Seems we lost eden in our search for greed.

What helps you wind down at the end of the night? As part of AOL Huffington Post Media Group's "Great Wake Up Challenge" with Lark, our sleep blogger asked you to share your answers to that question (with the added bonus of entering for a chance to win a great pair of Sheex sheets).
Here, some of our favorite answers, from the funniest ("Married With Children" marathons anyone?) to the most relaxing (we'll be trying that lavender spray!).

				For quite a while I have been watching TV before I go to bed. However, I had trouble falling asleep even with my nightly ritual of a cup of decaffeina­ted tea.  Also, several auto-immun­e disorders prevent me from enjoying a continuous night’s sleep. Several months ago I went through my day to try different ideas.  I limit nighttime TV, watch less political commentary then shut it!  I think pleasant and upbeat thoughts until I slow down.

My cat and I snuggle comfortabl­y as I ask angels to surround my bed.  I thank God for my day's blessings, children, cat, bird and friends. I give God ALL my pain of body, mind, spirit and emotion of the day and all unresolved pain of my past remembered or not.  This helps to heal me of past and present hurts and clears my head to pray. I pray for those for whom I promised to pray my children, friends, pets and residents in nursing homes where I work and volunteer. I include unnamed people in my “prayer bundle” those I meet during the day – those who cut me off in traffic, a person in the supermarke­t, a kindness received, anyone. Before I close my eyes I say “I am being healed” and fall asleep with a smile on my face.  If I awaken during the night I might get up for another cup of tea before I pray until hopefully, I fall asleep.

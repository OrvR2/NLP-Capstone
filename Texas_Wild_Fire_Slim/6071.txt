By Associated Press
BOULDER, Colo. -- Harbor has over two feet of ears. Does that make him a 6-foot dog?
Probably not. But on Tuesday, the black-and-tan coonhound from Boulder, Colo., gets the 2012 Guinness World Records title for "longest ears on a living dog."
His left ear is 12.25 inches long and his right is 13.5 inches long.
Owner Jennifer Wert says when her 8-year-old was a puppy, he would trip on his ears and roll down stairs.
These days, Wert says people often stop them to ask questions, take photos or tug on his ears.
Tigger, a bloodhound from Illinois who died in 2009, still holds the record for longest ears ever. One was 13.5 inches long, the other 13.75 inches long.
Coonhounds use their ears to help with scent.

When penalty kicks result in falling down and getting a yellow card By      Brooks Peck



A couple years ago, the paradinha (or "little stop") penalty kick approach was all the rage in Brazil (here's Retired Ronaldo doing it properly). But, ahead of the 2010 World Cup, FIFA outlawed the move, specifying that "feinting in the run-up to take a penalty kick to confuse opponents is permitted, however feinting to kick the ball once the player has completed his run-up is now considered an infringement."
It seems Al Ahly's Amir Sayoud never heard about this rule change, though, because in his side's 4-0 win over Kima Aswan in Egypt, he attempted to execute a paradinha and it went very wrong. After completing his run up to the ball, Sayoud stopped and tried to fake the shot, but his foot got caught, causing him to slip and fall as he actually kicked a slow dribbler towards the goalkeeper. And just to turn all that could've gone wrong on this sequence into a reality, the ref pulled out the yellow since Sayoud feinted only after he reached the ball.
The good news for Sayoud? I'm sure he's now very much aware of FIFA's paradinha rules.

2 users disliked this comment Osa 20 hours ago Report Abuse Poor officiating! The ref and his assistants could not comprehend the actual situation that made the player got confused and slipped. The goalkeeper was way off the touch line before the player approached the ball (goalkeeping trick) so as to narrow the goal post, which is not allowed in penalty shootout. The ref could have blown against the goalkeeper, and the penalty retaken.

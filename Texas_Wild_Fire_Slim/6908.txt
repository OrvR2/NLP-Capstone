        BASTROP, Texas, Sept. 7, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Texas Wildfire Relief Fund, a statewide non-profit that is working to raise funds and awareness about the ongoing crisis facing first responders battling wildfires across Texas, is making an urgent national plea for donations. The Texas Wildfire Relief Fund was established to aid volunteer firefighters' battling wildfires across Texas, including the largest active fire here in Bastrop.
    

	"Over 77 percent of fire departments in Texas are volunteer departments who struggle daily on getting the equipment they need to respond to emergencies across the state," said Chief Chris Barron, Director of the State Firemen's and Fire Marshals' Association of Texas (SFFMA). "Eighty-six percent of the state's volunteer firefighters use personal funds for their departments' safety equipment and supply needs."
Tax-deductible, secure online donations to the Texas Wildfire Relief Fund can be made by visiting, www.txwildfirerelief.org. 

	Barron added, "As Texas struggles with one of the worst droughts and wildfire seasons in state history, these volunteer first responders and their limited budgets are stretched thin. We hope Texans and people across the United States will give generously to these hard working volunteer firefighters."

	The Texas Wildfire Relief Fund website also offers additional information about the ongoing efforts to save lives and property while working to extinguish the worst wildfires in Texas history.

	Since January, wildfires have burned more than 3.5 million acres of Texas and destroyed more than 2,400 structures.

	"With over 3.5 million acres burned, numerous livestock lost and a tragic loss of life and property, we have to make sure the volunteer firefighters of Texas have the minimum amount of protective gear necessary to perform their jobs," said Barron.

	Since many volunteer fire departments operate with lean budgets in the best of circumstances, the wildfires only make their work more challenging and stretch their already limited resources.

	Barron noted that the Texas Wildfire Relief Fund has received nearly half a million dollars in requests for wildland firefighting gear since March and requests continue to come in from volunteer departments across the state.

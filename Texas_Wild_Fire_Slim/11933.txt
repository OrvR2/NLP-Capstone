OCEANSIDE, Calif., Sept. 9 (UPI) -- Oceanside, Calif., police have arrested a woman for stealing about 2,000 library books.
Police said Maria Natar, 44, was likely to resell the books she allegedly pilfered from Carlsbad and San Diego County libraries, CBS News reported Friday.
The investigation began when a Carlsbad library noticed a significant book loss between March and July.
A search of Natar's home found about 2,000 library books, mostly on cooking, crafts and animals, estimated to be worth at least $5,000.
"They were just everywhere, on shelves, in bins, stacks on the floor, just pretty much everywhere," said police spokeswoman Jodee Sasway.
Police arrested Natar after she made a stop at a library to pick up some more books.
"When she exited the library, the sensors went off, alerting the library people that not all the books were checked out," said Sasway.
The woman was booked into the Vista, Calif., jail on stolen property charges.

Sarah Ferguson’s “weird” interview sparks buzzBy Claudine ZapClaudine ZapPostsEmailBy Claudine Zap | The Lookout – Fri, Aug 12, 2011


Just because your title is Duchess of York does not mean you will get the royal treatment.
Sarah Ferguson has sparked buzz for a video that shows her storming off the set of an Australian news show when she was asked to watch a tape in which she seems to offer up access to her ex, Prince Andrew, for cash.
Ferguson's manager called the interview an "ambush." The "60 Minutes" news show--no, not the American newsmagazine franchise of the same name--claims it had prepared the duchess with the questions beforehand, and is promoting the segment as the "weirdest interview you will ever see." You can watch the promo footage of the interview above.
The duchess had been the target of a sting by the now-defunct Murdoch-owned British tabloid News of the World (which was shut down due to charges of illegal phone hacking): A reporter posed undercover to supposedly set up the deal but instead set the duchess up.

The tabloid claims that the duchess offered to sell access to her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, then the U.K. trade envoy, for £500,000 (or about $700,000) and was filmed accepting a $40,000 cash down-payment from the reporter. Unbeknownst to her husband, the duchess had allegedly been promising access and trade deals in exchange for a cut in profits.
The recent current-affairs interview was cut short when the interviewer asked the duchess to watch footage of the transaction. The Australian news team argued that the 2010 scandal was hardly news, and that the duchess had previously agreed to speak with them on tape. The show's producer sad that "she agreed to talk about the issue, as she has already extensively done, so it certainly wasn't entrapment."
Fergie's bad publicity hasn't done her any favors in the eyes of the royal family: The duchess was snubbed from Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding.

whats really pitiful is THIS story. It shows a video of Fergie saying pretty much nothing about anything. The true "ambush" is these trending stories that get to to click on them and really are nothing but advertisements...Yahoo "news" SUCKS

Fergie has been ambushed so many times that it is no longer funny - as if it ever was.  When I think of any media situation, I rarely fault the interviewee - the media sucks and will stop at nothing to win ratings - just look at what happened with Diana!  At the same time, Fergie, you continue to put yourself in the position.  Either bite it off and chew it, or learn to dislike the nasty taste it leaves in your mouth and move on.

Is the media stupid enough to think that the public really cares about what she did. She has been getting the shaft from the Royals and the media from the first day that her name was connect to Andrew. How about writing about how her children adore her and that she is working hard to improve her life. With the way the world is today, the media needs to stop the negative #$%$ and start writing heartwarming stories. I blame the media and all it's negativity with a lot of the worlds attitudes towards one another. STOP THE TRASH MEDIA

Good for her, She prefered to walk out, rather than to have gone off on those idiots...... If she would have, she would be in the news for an outragious behavior....Thumbs up for stanging up for an unacceptable behavior. Just because she is not married to Prince Andrew doesn't mean you can walk all over her. She should still be given the royal treatment, all of their guest should.

Seems like the media loves to rub peoples mistakes over and over on their faces. I guess they'll do anything for ratings.

I kind of feel she was ambushed. Sensationalisms makes them money.   She needs to stop with the interviews and find some other way to make money. She is a commoner now or maybe always was and she took her life for granted. She has shown us to appreciate what we have or things can drastically take a fall. I feel for her. Just leave her alone now. Let her get on with her life. Everyone deserves a new start.We all mess up at one point or another. I hate the media.

No wonder celebrities have such a hard time moving on with their lives when the press won't let them. Good for her for standing up for herself and not getting sucked in to an uncomfortable situation which obviously would have been twisted way out of proportion. How do I come to that conclusion? Because of the spin already being put on whatever footage these scummy reporters recorded. She has grown up, now it is time for the press to do the same.

The T.V. show was wrong to do that to her.And yes it was entrapment. I don't believe them. News Shows do a lot for publicity that isn't always in someones best interest. They do things to boost their ratings.

She is trying to move on with her life,leave her alone I am sure there are other things that media can ask her about her life now not about the mistakes she made in past. I find it very weird that people in the media and regular folk find it so appealing someone's else misfortune is like they thrive on it. If your life means so little to you that you must entertain yourself with other people's misfortune, well that's just plain sad.

Fergie made the mistake, apologized for it so leave it alone. She's a wonderful lady who made a mistake when she was really down and out. She paid the price already. Hold your head up, Fergie!

I am personally sick of this nonsense.  This lady has been thru alot and to bring up the same thing over and over is just hateful.  I don't care who she is, some people should learn the meaning of the word respect.  We all, no matter who we are, deserve it.

It never fails to amaze me how the media and its viewers feel they have the right to keep a pair of binoculars and a camera glued to their eyes and special audio equipment's head phones stuck in their ears so they spy on certain members of the royal family and other celebrities personal lives.  Then without any thought of empathy or just plain and simple kindness some of these private moments are blithely broadcast to the public where some people just live for this type of garbage and have to pry into business that is of no concern them.  Shame on the members of the media and the people who thrive on broadcasting, reading and listening to this garbage.  
Princess Diana along with her friends and driver were either killed or severely injured in a car accident that was caused by a form or media chasing them down a dangerous tunnel, Sarah Ferguson's later mistake in what she did/said being spread all around in an attempt to sully her reputation and name even more, Cruel and unnecessary words about Kate's dress and the Duchess of Cornwall, the cruel and invasive stories spread around about any celebrity, etc.  Very rare to peruse a story that is favorable to the person who's in the public's eye.  No it's the dirt that these people love to broadcast and read about. 
It is a crying shame that the media spreads this yellow journalism and that certain people who obvious thrive on sticking their noses and mouths into issues that are none of their business.  Leave these people alone.  They have a right to a private life just like you do.  Those who indulge in this horrible invasive actions should do some real soul searching and come to be totally ashamed of themselves.  They are poor excuses for human beings.

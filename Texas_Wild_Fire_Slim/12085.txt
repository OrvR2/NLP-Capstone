BRUSSELS (AP) — Warning: The warming of the world's oceans can cause serious illness and may cost millions of euros (dollars) in health care.That is the alarm sounded in a paper released online Tuesday on the eve of a two-day conference in Brussels.The 200-page paper is a synthesis of the findings of more than 100 projects funded by the European Union since 1998. It was produced by Project CLAMER, a collaboration of 17 European marine institutes.The paper says the rising temperature of ocean water is causing a proliferation of the Vibrio genus of bacteria, which can cause food poisoning, serious gastroenteritis, septicemia and cholera."Millions of euros in health costs may result from human consumption of contaminated seafood, ingestion of waterborne pathogens, and, to a lesser degree, though direct occupational or recreational exposure to marine disease," says the paper. "Climatic conditions are playing an increasingly important role in the transmission of these diseases."The paper also describes a host of other effects of ocean warming, both documented and forecast, including melting ice, rising sea levels, coastal erosion, increased storm intensity and frequency, along with chemical changes in the sea itself, including acidification and deoxygenation."What was striking to me was the enormous pile of evidence that things are already happening," Katja Philippart, a marine scientist at the Royal Netherlands Institute of Sea Research who was involved in putting the study together, told The Associated Press. "There is so much happening already. We are just in the midst of it."It is not only the range of changes that has scientists concerned, but the speed of them."The biggest surprise to me is the fact that things are changing in the ocean much more rapidly than we thought was possible," said Carlo Heip, who is director of the same institute in the Netherlands.In just a few decades, he said, the fish population of the North Sea has changed significantly, with larger species moving toward the arctic and smaller ones taking their place.He said the concentration of Vibrio genus of bacteria has been observed since the 1960s. "When the temperature in the North Sea began to increase at the end of the 80s, the Vibrios began to increase. One of those Vibrios is the cholera species."In the Baltic region in 2006, far more people got gastroenteritis than usual, Heip said. But he acknowledged that is anecdotal evidence only, and the extent of the danger is unclear.Philippart said some of the effects could even themselves contribute to global warming.The greater acidification of the ocean might mean that algae would be able to capture less carbon dioxide, she said. "Then there will be a further increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, leading to greater warming."Project CLAMER is holding a conference in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday._____Don Melvin can be reached at http://twitter.com/Don_MelvinOnline:www.clamer.eu

Ocean has been warning and cooling for gazillons of years. Man has survived it. Enough with this hyperbole. The sun goes through periods where it warms certain parts. Look at the south pole. It's COLDER there. but you ignore that agenda far left driven #$%$

It's amazing how the climate change wackos can always tie it into the topic of the day.  Now climate change causes higher healthcare cost!  The scary part is that people actually believe this crap!

Now the teabaggers can shake their fist and hope more Americans die including themselves. They are so stupid.

I don't imagine anyone cares but I feel like dying today. I probably shouldn't read yahoo, it mostly depresses me when I see how many uncaring people there are in the world. Most humans aren't very nice. :(

Instead of throwing billions of taxpayer dollars at the most profitable industry on earth, we need to get off oil. Period.

Anyone notice that the article says the ocean is warming but provides no data, no temperature increase, no scientific evidence.  Thats why they use the words "may", "might".  Its just another piece that will be proven a lie in month.

Enough taxpayer dollars going to Big Oil! I've had enough of paying for anti-science.

It's amazing how many uneducated, misinformed and otherwise idiotic people (neo-conservatives, bible thumpers, etc) there are on these forums. Obviously, their parents went swimming in the low end of the gene pool. We can only hope that their cowardly vitriol runs it's course and that more intelligent voices will be heard. Nature normally finds a way to cause the extinction of dead end branches of #$%$ sapiens. Hopefully, it's sooner than later.

It's time for Congress to end $44 billion in subsidies to Big Oil, an industry that doesn’t deserve it and doesn’t need it.

By some coincidence, Exxon increased lobbying expenditures by 25 percent this past quarter, bringing its total this year to $3 million.

Never fear, we have Obamacare!  Oh, I forgot.  Health care costs are still rising, and 1.5 million people have lost their coverage.  I guess it does pose a problem.

Exxon recently reported a whopping $10.7 billion in profits for the quarter, or $21.3 billion in the first half of this year—an increase of 54 percent from 2010.

Royal Dutch Shell recently announced 2011 second quarter earnings, reporting profits of $8 billion, a 77 percent jump from the same period a year ago.

GOD the reason poeple do nothing.
God will fix it poeple say.
God will cure my cancer poeple say.
yet  God didn't fix my toys so i blamed poeple and poeple cured my grandma so i thanked god.
now i don't believe in god and put my faith in chi and poeple.
And guess what my life hasn't changed.
also i'm scared shitless by global warming.

I would think conservatives would line up to cut $44 billion in taxpayer giveaways to Big Oil -- subsidies that even George W. Bush didn't support as President.

Photo of the day: Texas wildfireby Elizabeth Seward (RSS feed)  on Sep 7th 2011 at 6:00PM


Well, the Texas wildfires are officially too close to home. My home is in East Austin and the sky outside is filled with a hazy smoke. We had the windows open this week for the first time in months, but now they are closed so we can protect our lungs from this certainly unhealthy smoke pouring in. The largest, most damaging nearby fire has been in Bastrop, Texas--about 20 miles east of where I am. But the fires are sparking up in every direction, leaving a thick fog over the city of Austin, but also much anxiety.

A friend and fellow traveler, Ashley Halligan, ventured toward Bastrop yesterday and took this shot. No matter the vintage effects on this photo, the ominous smoke makes itself terribly clear. It's a scary time right now in Texas, to say the least. Please keep everyone who has been affected by the fires in your thoughts.

And if you'd like to submit a photo for Photo of The Day, just upload it to the Gadling Flickr Pool.

 Reader Comments (Page 1 of 1) jjohn  Sep 7th 2011 10:02PMSorry, but you guys elected a wing nut evangelical, he cut the budget for firefighting, claims FEMA is 'socialist' and wants to abolish it, and you don't pay any (income taxes) which, logically, could be used to pay for firefighters.  So, now he is calling for help from other states that pay for firefighters, wants FEMA help (!) and still doesn't want to raise any taxes.  The moral to the story is you get what you pay for and sadly, TX forgot to pay for firefighters and doesn't enforce common sense rules to rake up pine needles to remove fuel for fires.  I feel your pain, but shake my head at your whinning.Reply Ashley  Sep 8th 2011 1:32PMThough I agree Perry is a nut, you must also keep in mind that not everyone here elected him. He was, in fact, elected by Texas, but that doesn't mean 100% of Texans support him, particularly in the Austin area where the population tends to steer towards liberalism. Furthermore, what an asinine comment in light of the current situation where hundreds, nearly a thousand at minimum, folks have lost everything they own with no time for ample warning. Things are far more complex than the lack of income tax and our governor in terms of environmental truths, and it's led to more than reasonable broken hearts in the past week. You do get what you pay for, in all realms of life, but in this instance, it's unfair to point your finger at all Texas residents as the original catalyst to the issue. We're all people after all. And many of our hearts hurt right now.Reply

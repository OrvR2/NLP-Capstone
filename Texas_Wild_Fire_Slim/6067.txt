BOULDER, Colo. — Fox Sports canceled a show that aired a segment that mocked Asian students who were filmed on the University of Southern California campus.
Fox Sports Network spokesman Lou D'Ermilio said in a statement that last week's segment was "clearly offensive" and that the show "The College Experiment" would be cancelled effective immediately.
The Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder, Colo. reported ( ) about the video and the network issued an apology. The video shows a comedian approaching Asian students at USC and asking them to welcome the universities of Colorado and Utah to the Pac-12 Conference. The comedian tells the students to give the new Pac-12 members an "All-American welcome" and then mocks students' accents. http://goo.gl/RmKAE
D'Ermilio says the video was removed as soon as the network became aware of it.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.
Fox Sports is apologizing for what it calls an "inappropriate" segment filmed on the University of Southern California campus that critics say mocks Asian students.
Fox Sports Network sent the apology after the Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder, Colo., reported () about the video. It shows a comedian approaching Asian students at USC and asking them to welcome the universities of Colorado and Utah to the Pac-12 Conference. The comedian tells the students to give the new Pac-12 members an "all-American welcome" and then mocks students' accents. http://goo.gl/RmKAE
In the statement, network spokesman Lou D'Ermilio addresses the apology to USC President Max Nikias.
"We sincerely apologize to President Nikias and the entire USC community for the production and posting of the video," D'Ermilio wrote. "The context was clearly inappropriate and the video was removed as soon as we became aware of it. We will review our editorial process to determine where the breakdown occurred, and we will take steps to ensure something like this never happens again."
University of Colorado ethnic studies professor Darryl Maeda, who saw the segment, told the newspaper that the piece relies on stereotypes of Asians as "perpetual foreigners." The interviewer appeared to seek students for whom English is not their first language, he said.
"This is demeaning to millions of Asian Americans who have put down deep roots in the United States, claim English as their language and root vigorously for their favorite sports teams," Maeda said.
CU's football team hosts the USC Trojans on Nov. 4. CU and Utah entered the Pac-12 in July.

				Hello AOL and HUFFINGTON POST are you going to be weaker than Fox Sports or maybe it doesn't count because the Faces of Black men One with His Mouth Pulled from Side to Side and the other with Tatoos all over his Face, they were as offensive when Your Two Company's posted them and no apologies were given to Black People not like the Language which is heard not 
seen many people have accents and the Nationalit­y is a guess in xome instances, but Displaying the Faces for 3-4 Months is much worse because they were embarassin­g to Black Men. Then to deliberate­ly attack my E-Mail with Nasty Comments was a Corporate style of revenge By getting some Wussie to do your dirty work. Then the sorry part of the Situation happens to be,
I am a Monthly Paying Customer and have been since the Mid 1980'S before the person assigned to attact me was Born, and long before your merger and using each other to Violate the Privacy Act. I hope for the good of your existance the Two Companies can get their Act together and Publicly Apologize to the Black People of the World who were personally harmed by giving others Negative impression­s of Black Men???

				That brought back some powerful memories of a high school teacher I had the misfortune to have who used to mercilessl­y mock a girl in my class who had a high, squeaky voice and a very strong Ukrainian accent.  Not that he ever noticed, but she was a very good writer and an excellent artist.

				My deepest apologies for taking a couple hours to respond. I can assure you that these previous two hours were not spent looking for an example, as I attempted to watch tonights performanc­e by the current GOP field.  Second, you wanted proof? Here is the link:

http://new­sone.com/n­ation/case­y-gane-mcc­alla/top-5­-fake-fox-­news-racis­t-scandals­/


Finally, you do not even know me so how can YOU say "as usual you just LIED," when we have never encountere­d one another before.  Please refrain from accusing me of something which you do not personally have knowledge of.  Enjoy reading the Top Five Racist blunders by Fox and please notice the screen shot when you click on the link: I find the Kumbya and the men dressed in KKK outfits especially enlighteni­ng with Doocey on there.

				It would have been hilarious if they, threw this fix noise racist and camera in the chipper. These students are probably tops in their class in engineerin­g and medical school. So go ahead fix noise mock these kids all you want. But smart kids tend to push this country forward with leadership­. And not sit on the sofa dreaming about their glory days as the popular high school sports jock,cheer­leader or home coming queen. Like a high % of fix noise viewers.

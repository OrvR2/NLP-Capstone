East Texas Bear Creek Fire at 14,000 acres and growing, evacuations ordered

 | 

As of noon Tuesday more than 14,000 acres of land had burned in Cass and Marion counties over a widespread area. Six structures were reported destroyed, but the fire had not claimed any lives.  State Trooper Sylvia Jennings said the so-called Bear Creek blaze continued to move south into Marion County. At the time, the fire was four miles from Jefferson.  www.news-journal.com
Cass County and Marion County judges have declared their counties disaster areas and in a state of emergency. They are requesting additional resources from outside sources.
Several county roads between U.S. Highway 59 and Texas Highway 155 had been closed due to the fire.
Officials are contacting residents by going door to door in fire-threatened areas. Residents are being asked to go to evacuation shelters set up at three locations in the county: Pinecrest Baptist Church in Linden, Linden United Methodist Church and West Side Baptist Church in Atlanta.
Families needing information about evacuations and whether it is save to return to their homes may contact the Cass County Sheriff’s Office at 903-756-5571.

Mookie: Amazing.  Hat's off to y'all!  Stay safe....Kim Gillihan: Thanks to your brother and all other fighting these fires!Fookie: Darla - I don't know the circumstances surrounding the offer of assistance by these good men.  However, it is very unusual for anyone to walk on to the scene of an emergency without belonging to an organization such as a CERT group or emergency service provider.  I hope these men will take the opportunity to join up with a local fire department, EMS provider or disaster service like Red Cross so that their expertise can best be utilized.Fookie: Texas-Fire does its best to provide accurate information that we glean from various sources.  The above story comes from KLTV, KYTX and www.cbs19.tvFookie: Try these links.  Second one is a good map.

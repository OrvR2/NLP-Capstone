I admire the hard work Obama has done, I but feel he put too much importance on Health Reform just to leave his mark. But, that is going against him now because it took valuable time away from the more important issue in this country and that is job creation. He promised jobs, but he has showed no real efforts to have them created which puts him out of touch with the average American out there. I come from Reno the city that has the highest unemployment rate in  the country. Our crime is raising here as well as all over because of it,. and Obama has made a trip here to talk to the people about it,but is just not coming up with the solution. He has become a token president being the first Black in office, but now I'm praying he can in what little time he has left, show us what a real president is made of. I do wish him luck. I would like to see him succeed. I blame this on the men he has centered around him. They are just not smart enough to get the job done, I guess.

hey Tresa, obama does not want americans being successfully employed if they don't work for him.  Traditional business create jobs, he and his followers just declared war on private businesses.

What we must never forget is that on 9/11 God failed all of us miserably.  After putting His favorite idiot in as President, defiling our money and license plates with "In God We Trust" and showering his spokesmen stooges with untold millions of dollars, still God screwed us on 9/11.  We need to dump that Turkey and go with Someone else, say Ra or Jupiter.

It is sad that even when remembering such a horrible day, there are many who just can't let go of the arrogance, the article says that 9/11 was a day that changed the life of billions around the world. no it didn't. it changed ours as we had to learn to live with less freedoms and more caution.
The rest of the world already lived like this, we were affected, we joined the rest of the world, 
I know that as a nation we can rise again but our politicians are too busy playing the us vs the world and forgetting about fixing things here at home. it will be even more difficult now because out of many, we are yet to become one nation.
The day we stop using the something-American for good, that day we will be closer to being one nation. not before.

First Responders– including police, fire fighters, EMTs and others– have been barred from attending the ceremony commemorating the 10th Anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Instead, warmongering politicos including President Obama and former President George W. Bush will grandstand at Ground Zero, trampling upon the memory of those who lost their life while stifling the living heroes who have increasingly questioned the official story, the lack of care for those who got sick and other travesties.

It is sad to say but true to the word that when you look down on someone you can't hold you head up because you are too busy looking down.  America needs to respect all people in all countries it does not matter if they are 3rd world or 1st world there is only one world.  I love my country and wish to be nowherelse but a bee will not sting if it is not provoked!  As Americans we send our people all over the world to preach our beliefts and disrespecting theirs like Mother Africa and along with that comes hate.  one world people and it takes all kinds.  Our president is having a hard time simply because of his skin color he is the first president since my birth that really cared about all of the people! and don't forget he was not the president when 9/11 hit and he was not the president when the economy went belly up be he is the president that is trying to fix it and it is a pity that the rest of congress will not work with him to do what is needed to make America strong again!

We thoroughly deserved what we got.  None are so blind as those who will not see.  Quit the self-pity, America, and stop invading and bombing countries in the Mideast..

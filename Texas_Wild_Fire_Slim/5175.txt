‘Where were you?’ News outlets crowdsource their 9/11 coverageBy Joe PompeoMedia ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Joe Pompeo | The Upshot – Fri, Aug 26, 2011

One of the 9/11 relics collected by Dan Barry (Richard Perry/The New York Times)Media outlets have been pouring resources into their 9/11 coverage as the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks approaches. Among the most valuable resources, it turns out, are readers.
From the Post and Courier of Charleston, S.C. to the Bulletin of South Washington County, Minn., news organizations nationwide are asking readers to share their memories of that day, when thousands of Americans died after al Qaeda operatives crashed passenger planes into the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and a barren field in Pennsylvania.
"It's the question that comes up over and over again every year--where were you?," said Amy Westfeldt, the 9/11 anniversary editor of the AP, which put out a call for "most vivid" 9/11 memories on its Facebook page earlier this month and has since been compiling the responses into a weekly feature.
"I was 9 years old on 9/11," Jeffersonton, Va. resident Coy Ferrell recalls in the latest installment, "and at least here they had a constant patrol of fighters all throughout the region from soon after the attacks to weeks after the attacks. Whenever I hear a jet fighter I still cringe."
These exercises in crowd-sourcing reflect the increased interactivity that is becoming more a part of the fabric of news reporting. (Yahoo! News, for its part, is gathering submissions on the 9/11 blog it has set up to mark the anniversary.)
"The days of a website just being a website are over," said Jimmy Orr, the managing editor of latimes.com. "Reader engagement is so very important, social media is so important. People expect to be able to interact."
That was the thinking behind the Los Angeles Times' "Where were you?" on 9/11 project. The paper posed this question on its homepage and has likewise been encouraging readers to submit their recollections--including photos and video--on Tumblr.
"Many hundreds" of submissions have poured in, said Orr. The result is an interactive 9/11 landing page on latimes.com that collects some of the most poignant of these alongside relevant reportage from the paper's journalists. The newspaper also has been sharing select vignettes on Tumblr.
"I called my ex-wife, who worked about 15 miles closer to Manhattan, and  frantically told her to pick up the baby and return to the house, that  we should all be together in case a nuclear bomb went off," writes Tony Dela Cruz of of Marlborough, Mass., who at the time was a magazine editor living on Long Island. "I found  myself wanting to skip over 'well-planned terrorist attack' and go  directly to Armageddon, as if increasing the gravity of the situation  would make what had happened easier to accept. ... This loss still feels fresh as the day it happened."
The Daily, News Corp.'s 6-month-old iPad newspaper, also used Tumblr to spread the word. The digital tabloid comes equipped with a feature that enables readers to leave audio comments using the iPad's built-in microphone. The editors decided to ask readers to "help create an oral history of the day" by leaving 60-second sound bytes of their 9/11 stories that will be adapted into a multimedia feature as part of The Daily's forthcoming anniversary coverage. Dozens have come in so far.
"One of the great things about this is that it's an experiment," said Mike Nizza, The Daily's managing editor. "It's a human exercise for these people--taking the time to remember and tell their stories."
The New York Times is using the lobby of its Midtown Manhattan headquarters to host an art exhibit of 9/11 reflections. The show, open to the public from Sept. 8 to Sept. 12, will include photos of 9/11 relics that readers submitted to Times reporter Dan Barry after he put out a request on nytimes.com. Some of the photos will be published in print and online on Sept. 11.
"Dan keeps some objects from his months covering 9/11 on his desk--relics, he calls them--and we simply wondered what objects other people might have kept," said Laura Chang, the editor overseeing the Times' 9/11 coverage. "Hundreds of readers have sent us images of objects, some obviously related to 9/11 and some that reveal the connection only in the telling."
As for Barry, "I have the construction helmet that I wore when I camped out near the  site with the National Guard, several days after the collapse," he writes. "I have a flier from the Dakota Roadhouse bar in Lower Manhattan, saying  in colorful language that since Osama bin Laden has us working overtime,  it's time to drink."

Its strange that they have kinda quit giving the option to voice your opinion on the main yahoo page when it comes to Obama or 9/11.

I was setting on by bunk in my cell waiting to go on the outside work crew in prison in Arizona. The helpless feeling of being locked up on a drug charge and no way to help is hard to describe. Then the days after with no traffic in the skies where all planes had been grounded. I will always remember this.

I was working at Sigsbee Elem School on The Naval Base Housing in Key West when we found out about the terrorism attack at The Trade Center. We received instructions  to evacuated the building. After we sent all the students home I have the chance to called my sister who lived in New York at the time to see how her and her family were doing.
I was relief to know that she was ok but at the same time sad for the victims and their families.
I have no words to describe how I felt when I found out that my cousin Tony was on his way to work at The Trade Center but he didn`t make it due to traffic.

I was standing in the mirror doing my hair ready to leave for Mackinac Island Michigan when Charles Gibson said on GMA that a small plane hit the  WTC.  I stood infront of the TV watching the whole incident unfold.  I was froze by what I saw thinking God please don't let any people be in those buildings.  Well I never went on the trip.  This is worst thing that ever happened in my lifetime.  Many of my family members have passed away and I grieved, but not like I grieved for all those people in the Twin towers.  That brought me to my knees.

First fact: The September 11 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon was a direct response to the U.S. government's long-term support for Israel's aggression against her neighbors in the Middle East. The attack was not irrational or cowardly or unprovoked. And we were not attacked because fundamentalist Muslims hate America's freedom and democracy or because they want to oppress American women. America was attacked simply because the U.S. government has helped Israel attack and plunder her neighbors.

Second fact: Everyone of any consequence in the U.S. government and in America's mass media understands with perfect clarity the first fact.

Third fact: Everyone of any consequence in the U.S. government and in America's mass media has lied consistently and deliberately about why America was attacked and also about why the U.S. government is starting new wars in the Middle East.

Fourth fact: The reason for the lying by the media people and by the politicians and government officials is Jewish influence. Jews own or control most of the mass media in the United States, and they also own the politicians, for all practical purposes.

Fifth fact: If the U.S. government remains subservient to the Jews and continues its Israel-first policy in foreign affairs, as it is doing now with its war against Afghanistan and Israel's other enemies in the Middle East (Iran and Syria), Americans will continue to pay the price, and only Jews will profit.

These five facts bear repeating over and over and over again. They are simple and self-evident, but it is easy to forget them in the blizzard of lies and obfuscation coming from the news media. One fundamental principle that professional liars rely on is that a lie, no matter how transparent or preposterous, if repeated often enough and brazenly enough, will be believed by most people. And if repeated loudly enough it will drown out the truth, and even the more perceptive and thoughtful members of the population will forget what is truth and what is a lie.

The 9-11 Commission based its assessments on testimony from experts on terrorism and the Middle East. Asked about the motivations of the terrorists, FBI Special Agent James Fitzgerald told the commission:  "I believe they feel a sense of outrage against the United States. They identify with the Palestinian problem, they identify with people who oppose repressive regimes, and I believe they tend to focus their anger on the United States."

Assuming we have even been told the truth about WHO carried out 911 and the government version is doubtful at best, notice how the CRIMINAL politicians from BOTH parties and the JEWISH CONTROLLED MEDIA continue BRAZENLY LYING to the American people by telling them we were attacked becuase "They Hate Our Freedom"?  Hey America, your government is TOTALLY CORRUPT!!!!

I was at home in Springfield, Va., 9 miles from the Pentagon.  I was waiting for the stock market and I was watching a broadcast from a business station that was situated in New Jersey.  They were live with the New York skyline behind them.  We saw the first plane hit.  Of course when you see something like that, you immediately think some sort of accident.  After it hit, you could see that great big antenna start to lean.  Then another plane hit the second tower.  Then a plane hit the Pentagon.  It was going 500 miles an hour and some people heard the roar as it passed over us.  My son works at the Labor Deparment building on Constitution Ave in downtown DC and the building is at the foot of Capitol Hill and the personnel were told to evacuate.  Then we heard that there was a fourth plane headed for the Capitol, it was flight 93.  If those brave passengers had been unable to make that plane crash, my son could have been in danger.  9/11 felt like a huge punch in the stomach.  I remember wishing that I had not lived long enough to witness such horror.  I was stunned into silence---there were just no words----------

I was at home chatting online with a friend who's in UK then. She said something about a plane crashing into a building. I didn't have a clue it was actually happening. I thought she was just referring to a movie or something. When I saw it on the news myself, we were both saddened. Shocked. In disbelief.

My husband and I were were traveling from Gatlinburg, TN to Cherokee, NC and had just stopped at a mountain stream to admire the beauty of the area. It was a beautiful day with the sun shining through the trees. Our vacation wasn't the same after that and I didn't have an interest in doing anything.  I wanted to be near the comforts of home.

Vengeance not crying-I want payback,not speeches and I want it EVERY 9/11.

I was in my dental office doing some x rays and the radio, which was on  to some music , interrupted to say a plane had hit the World Trade Center. I couldn't believe my ears as it was an exceptionally clear day. I was sure it was an accident.
"How could the pilot be so blind as to hit the enormous building unless it was out of control?"
Now I feel it should be a day of  national vengeance, not remembrance.
Every 9/11  the US should go to one of the terrorist camps in Pakistan or Iraq or Iran 
or Yemen and OBLITERATE IT.
Crying,wringing our hands, church services only reinforces our enemies and shows our weakness and how much harm they did.
Let them feel our anger in their homes and they will cry also.
You haven't seen any Russian or Chinese building damaged in terrorist  incidents becasue they would destroy the entire SUSPECTED areas. No need for proof,just revenge.
Vengeance and payback,not crying and consolation.

I was spending my second full day both as a disabled Vietnam Veteran and diabetic due to the effects of Agent Orange exposure. My wife called me into the living room to see the fire in the first tower, and I saw the second plane hit. My first thought was...Those #$%$ didn't get the job done the first time they tried using the truck in the Tower basement. Now they have destroyed both Towers - WE ARE AT WAR!

I was sleeping on the couch and  recieved a call informing about the first plane. Instantly I thaught we are at war or so will be. I turned on the teli and it was already on every network. I was angry to see people crying, when they should be preparing for another attack. Dot not show weakness to your enemies. You can cry afterwards. Then the second plane hit. Where the bloody hell is everyone, the goverment asleep at the wheel. I was the civilains that picked up the slack.  the president was such an embarrasment. I am glad the had a fill in walking the streets of new york. we should not give any credit to the terrorist. we did this to ourselves. After the cold war we let our guard down. Everyone comes after number one. I is a struggle to found a nation, and a never ending battle to keep it.

Not a very good following Joe but I guess that's what happens in the end stage of the Empire. When the folks catch onto the game and those pushing it ahead the people stop responding. Spend your time writing worth while stories and not attaching yourself to cheap War Propaganda and Police State Propaganda!!

I was working for the mayor because it was primary day. We passed by the towers about 15 minutes before the first plane hit on our way to the Staten Island headquarters.

I was at a field work watching with a coworker who had her husband there. Thank God he didn't listen and got out! I will pray for the families and the poor souls who trusted those who told them to stay put as both building one and building two were demo'd. later building seven.

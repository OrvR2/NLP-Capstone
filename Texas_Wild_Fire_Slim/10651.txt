What is carbon exchange? 
  Carbon trading has emerged recently as a means of reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Through the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), greenhouse gas “credits” are traded.  One carbon credit is equal to one metric ton of carbon dioxide. Companies looking to voluntarily regulate their carbon emissions can purchase credits to offset their carbon emissions; these credits come from landowners who can sell the carbon that has been sequestered on their land through either forestry or agricultural means.

Where does this money come from? 
  Companies who are regulating their carbon emissions can purchase carbon credits in order to offset their own emissions. 
Back to Top
 What incentives do companies have to join CCX? 
  At this time participation in the CCX is voluntary in the US; however, in the European Union, and other nations currently participating in the Kyoto Protocol, carbon exchange is an important aspect of meeting emission limits that are enforced by law. This may soon be the case in the U.S. as well, and companies may benefit legally from taking early action. By voluntarily following emissions limits, companies can enhance the environmental sustainability of their business, an aspect that many consumers are looking to support as environmental awareness grows. 
Back to Top
How does planting trees reduce carbon in the atmosphere? 
  Healthy, growing trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen through the process of photosynthesis.  While trees can also release carbon dioxide through decomposition, healthy growing forests usually have net gains in carbon.
Back to Top
How will it be verified that the land meets qualifications? 
  An approved verifier will confirm the enrolled land meets all eligibility criteria and the actual amount of sequestered carbon.
Back to Top
What is an aggregator? 
  An aggregator is an organization that “pools” offset projects from multiple landowners so they can be sold on the open market. 
Back to Top
Will I as the landowner pay fees to the aggregator? 
  Yes, aggregators generally take varying percentages, usually 10%, of the payments earned from the sale of carbon credits before sending the landowner their portion of the revenue. 
Back to Top
 How many trees do I need to plant per acre? 
There is no set limit, however planting between 400 -750 trees per acre will yield the most carbon credits.
Back to Top
Does it matter when I planted these trees? 
  Yes! Since the Kyoto Protocol was established to reduce emissions from the 1990 level, only trees planted, or regenerated, after 1990 are eligible. 
Back to Top
What are vintage credits? 
  Carbon credits for forestry projects are retroactive. This means that any forest planted or regenerated since 1990 can be enrolled for vintage carbon credits. Currently, the CCX allows landowners to claim credits all the way back to 2003. 
Back to Top
How much land do I need to own to qualify? 
  There is no minimum number of acres to qualify.  In the last pool verified by Texas Forest Service (TFS), landowners were enrolled with as little as 10 acres. 
Back to Top
Would I earn more or less money due to various types of land use? 
  Yes, forested land, on average, earns nearly 4 times as much carbon credits as land planted in grasses. 
Back to Top
What paperwork will I need to complete? 
  Landowners interested in participating must sign a contract with a CCX-approved aggregator. 
Back to Top
How much money can I expect? 
  This depends on the amount of land that is enrolled, geographic location, species, age of trees, and market conditions.  For every 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent that your forestland is sequestering annually, you would have earned one carbon credit.   Currently, carbon credits are trading for $3.50.  Landowners, on average, can expect $10-20 per acre in revenue from the sale of carbon credits.
Back to Top
Will I be paid only one time, or will it be continual? 
  Payments will be continual.  However, carbon credits are sold at the discretion of the aggregator.  Typically, aggregators make payments at least once per year. 
Back to Top
Will the amount of money fluctuate or change? 
  Yes.  Just as the stock market values fluctuate due to varying demands, the carbon exchange functions in a similar manner. 
Back to Top
Will being involved in this program change my taxes, subsidies or other government funding? 
  Carbon credits are simply an additional form of income, and as such, must be reported as income. 
Back to Top
Is there any maintenance work involved? 
  No.
Back to Top
Is there a contract? Do I need to keep land forested for a certain amount of time? 
Currently, contracts require that forests be maintained for fifteen years.  After this, contracts can be renewed if desired. These contracts are legally binding once signed. During the years that the land is in contract, the CCX will retain 20% of carbon offsets in the reserve pool. If the contract is not broken, and no other losses to carbon stocks occur, then at the end of the contracted agreement, the credits will be sold and revenue will go to the landowner. 
Back to Top
Why does CCX retain 20% of carbon offsets in a reserve pool? 
  This is done to compensate for potential losses in stored carbon due to natural disasters (tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfire, insects, etc.). 
Back to Top
Can I, as a forest landowner harvest timber? 
  Projects enrolled in the managed forests protocol are allowed to harvest timber.  However, losses in carbon credits from timber harvests must be accounted.
Back to Top
Can any species that I plant qualify, or will some species earn more money than others? 
  Faster growing species, will accumulate carbon faster, thus increasing the amount of carbon credits; however, having diverse carbon crops is not only more ecologically sound, but will bring other benefits as well as buffer from losses due to disease or pests.
Back to Top
 How much money has been disbursed for Texas projects so far?
Approximately $170,000
Back to Top
Since when?
The verification began in March 2008 and was completed in May 2008.  Payments were made to landowners in July 2008.
Back to Top
How much money is predicted to be paid to landowners for carbon credits by one year mark in Texas?
$1,000,000 
Back to Top
How often do landowners receive checks? 
This is dependent upon the aggregator, but typically at least once per year.
Back to Top
How long is the landowner commitment to the carbon credit program once enrolled?
Currently the commitment period is 15 years.  Landowners that enrolled prior to December 12, 2007 were committed through 2010. 
Back to Top
How many landowners have participated in carbon credit projects in Texas so far?
129 
Back to Top
For how many credits?
Texas projects have accounted for 210,000 carbon credits to date.
Back to Top
For how many acres?
14,000 acres 
Back to Top
Does the credit amount increase for the landowner as the stands of trees enrolled in the program mature?
  Yes.  As trees grow older, they are able to sequester more carbon up to a certain point, and then it levels off before declining.
Back to Top
What kinds of trees qualify for the carbon credit program?
Most native tree species qualify for the carbon credit program. To date, all verified land has consisted of pine trees (loblolly pine.)
Back to Top
Where is the property currently enrolled in the Texas Carbon credit program located?
So far all of the Texas projects are located in East Texas.
Back to Top
What is the current market price for carbon?
$3.50 per credit. It has been as high as $7.50 (June 2008).
Back to Top
How is carbon measured?
Carbon may be measured by using reference tables that are based on the species, age, and geographic location to determine a per acre rate.  Computer models can also be used to determine carbon storage based on a forest inventory for an entire project.
Back to Top
Who does the calculations?
An aggregator or consultant working for the landowner.
Back to Top
How are calculated credits verified?
Verifiers audit the paperwork that is submitted by aggregators to confirm that the enrolled land meets all eligibility criteria, carbon has been correctly quantified, and supporting documentation is present.  Site visits are also conducted to confirm species, acreage, age, and the accuracy of forest inventory data (number of trees and volume).
Back to Top
Does Texas Forest Service (TFS) receive payment for verification work?
Yes. TFS (or any other verifier) charges a fee for the verification process. However, the emphasis of why Texas Forest Service performs verification work is as a public service to landowners and does so at a minimum fee.
Back to Top
Why does TFS verify?
TFS is verifier of carbon credits to help develop the ecosystem services market in Texas and add credibility to the program.
Back to Top
Has TFS ever found discrepancies in the enrolled data versus the agency findings during verification?
Yes. There have been cases where ineligible land was enrolled in the program.  Also, in some cases, the number of acres claimed did not match the actual eligible acres. 
Back to Top
Who is eligible to participate?
All forest landowners who manage land sustainably and meet certain other conditions are eligible to participate in the program. 
Back to Top
How many acres minimum for participation?
There is no minimum number of acres for participation.  In the last pool of applicants that TFS verified, some landowners with as few as 10 acres were enrolled. 
Back to Top
How do landowners enroll?
Landowners should contact an approved carbon aggregator or consultant to assist with this process.  For more information, landowners can also visit the Texas Forest Service website. 
Back to Top
Is this program a result of global climate change or global warming?
It is difficult to disprove the increasing emissions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, so it is important for landowners to recognize that there are programs out there that can offset these emissions. Regardless of one’s views on climate change, landowners can be paid to grow trees to offset human caused carbon dioxide emissions. 
Back to Top
Explain the initial rules of eligibility versus the current requirements.
Initially in Texas, landowners were required to have planted open land (pasture or cropland) after 1989 and agree to maintain 250 trees per acre through 2010 in order to be eligible.  Now, landowners are able to enroll both planted open land after 1989 as well as forests that are managed sustainably but must agree to maintain them for 15 years. 
Back to Top
Are Texas Landowners the first to participate in the exchange of carbon credits for forest land? What other states participate?
Texas forestland owners are among the first in the nation to be paid for storing carbon in their trees. Other Southern States include Georgia, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi  - though none of those states have enrolled as many as Texas.
Back to Top
Does TFS expect to see an increase in landowner participation?
Yes. With more than seven million privately-owned forested acres in East Texas, the number of projects that are enrolled should grow exponentially as more landowners learn about the revenue that can be generated from this program.

Jewish Leaders Slam Mel Gibson, Warner Bros. for Judah Maccabee Movie (Exclusive)"Casting him as a director or perhaps as the star of 'Judah Maccabee' is like casting Madoff to be the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission," says Rabbi Marvin Heir.By Alex Ben Block, Daniel Miller | The Hollywood Reporter – 19 hours ago

Mel Gibson

Prominent Jewish leaders are beginning to speak out
against Mel Gibson and Warner Bros. over their planned movie based on the life
of religious icon Judah Maccabee.
Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti Defamation
League, who criticized Gibson’s controversial 2004 film The Passion of the
Christ, issued a statement to The Hollywood Reporter in response to the news.
“Judah Maccabee deserves better. He is a hero of the
Jewish people and a universal hero in the struggle for religious liberty. It
would be a travesty to have his story told by one who has no respect and
sensitivity for other people’s religious views,” Foxman tells THR of the
project, which is being co-developed by Basic Instinct writer Joe Eszterhas.PHOTOS: '80s Action Stars: Where Are They Now?In the lead-up to Passion’s release, Foxman could be
found on numerous talk and news programs slamming the drama. In a speech to the
ADL’s national executive committee just before the film’s release, Foxman
questioned whether Passion could trigger anti-Semitism.
Rabbi Marvin Heir, founder and dean of Los Angeles's Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum
of Tolerance, also is speaking out against the new film. He tells THR that the
project is merely the latest slap in the face to Jewish people by Gibson, who
has been accused of making anti-Semitic comments.Heir tells THR in a statement:
"Mel Gibson has shown nothing but antagonism and
disrespect to Jews. First of all there were the anti-Semitic remarks he made,
his portrayal of Jews in The Passion of Christ. I’m talking about those Jews
who did not accept Christ, they were all portrayed as idiots, buffoons or
people who were tyrants, with a very unfair portrayal. He’s had a long history
of antagonism with Jews. Casting him as a director or perhaps as the star of
Judah Maccabee is like casting Madoff to be the head of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, or a white supremacist as trying to portray Martin Luther
King Jr. It's simply an insult to Jews."
Heir also is criticizing Warner Bros., a unit of publicly-traded Time Warner, for agreeing to distribute the movie."Warner Bros. is making a terrible mistake," Heir says, adding, "most
 of the people that are going to come to a film about Judah Maccabee are
 the Jewish community. Surely they know the Jewish communities are not 
going to come to this film."
Heir says he has no objection to Gibson making a living as an 
actor or director, but he has not apologized sufficiently for comments 
deemed anti-Semitic:
"Has he shown any sensitivity to Jews after those
incidents? Has he gone out of his way to write an editorial to explain himself,
to do some outreach and to understand better the implications of the Holocaust
or maybe on one of his visits to Europe to
stop at a concentration camp and show some sensitivity? Nobody would say a
person doesn’t deserve another chance. There’s no question about that. But he
has not shown any of that evidence at all. I am sort of appalled by such a
portrayal, because it’s a complete misfit for the role of Judah Maccabee, one
of the greatest Jewish heroes in all of history to be portrayed by someone who
has shown nothing but antagonism and anti Semitism toward Jews."
Gibson has not said whether he will play Maccabee, or even whether he will act in the movie.Still, regardless of his opposition to the project, Foxman 
says, "America is a free country and anyone can do whatever they want, 
so long as they don’t hurt others."Email: Alex.BenBlock@THR.com

They're has been good and ugly movies made about famous from every race of people. Heir has a right to complain as much as Gibson has a right to create art as he sees it. The bottom line is you can either see the flick or not. DA!

"most of the people that are going to come to a film about Judah Maccabee are the Jewish community." is like saying 'Most of the people going to see a movie about Barak Obama will be blacks."  This guy's a racist.  A 'great man' is a great man, and a movie about him appeals to all... non-racists that is.  Oh, and I DIDN'T mean Barak is great!!

Foxman, attack dog for the Jews is at it again! Foxman ask your Jewish buddies in Hollywood to give you a role as Moses for the Jews because you are the law giver, law maker,liberator and proponent of the 10 Anti-Semitic Commandments!

Mel Gibson is an anti-Jewish bigot and a coward. I do not view his films and will continue to speak out against him and encourage others to boycott his films. He is one of the greatest examples of catholic christian bigotry still alive in this world.  If I were ever to be able to meet him in person, I would make sure he doesn't spew his vitriol any further.

I don't think he's a racist. I love Mel and his movies. It's strange how the Jews do not say racist unless they are looking for support from other races; as if they are different from us. A racist is a racist. What's the big deal? Jewish owned medias produce movies that pits the caucasian against the the blacks or the Asians against other Asians. No one can say anything about the jewish production of racist movies, but when they are depicted as bad guy in movies it is so ungodly... wow!

Key point in the New Testament narration is the debate between Jesus(& his followers) and the Jews. But since Jesus (the Man) was also a Jew, they felt that He was subject to their laws & rules. Their violence on Jesus & His followers was justified under circumstances prevailing then. Now if Foxman found portrayal of Jews as "idiots" in the Passion, he is missing the point in the mindset of his ancestors who were desperately trying to protect their lifestyle in midst of sweeping changes Jesus offered the Jewish people.

When one makes a movie about the Jews and they do not agree with it... then it is always anti-semitism... get over with the self preservation... just relax it is just a movie.

THIS IS MORE THEN JUST A MOVIE THAT WILL OR WILL NOT MAKE MONEY, CAN YOU OR CAN'T YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE CHANGE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES WHEN THEY SAW THE PASSION OF CHRIST MOVIE? IF MEL GIBSON IS A CHRISTIAN AT ALL OR EVEN MAYBE THE LORD PUT SOMETHING IN HIS HEART TO DO. IF THIS ALL IS THE LORD'S DOING, THEN NOTHING OR NOBODY CAN STOP IT...

With my Grand Father being a Rabbi I can with out any bias say Fu(c the A.D.L.

the great thing about Gibson is he is rich enough to budget the movie himself and still make money off it.

In the September 2011 issue of National Geographic, Cynthia Gorney examines how Brazil's fertility rate has plunged below replacement levels, and provides a how-to guide for bringing down a developing nation's fertility rate without government intervention. Remarkably, in a country where abortion is largely illegal and the government doesn't promote birth control, many women from all social classes have made raising children a lower priority. As Cynthia Gorney's report states:
[The] new Brazilian fertility rate is below the level at which a population replaces itself. It is lower than the two-children-per-woman fertility rate in the United States. In the largest nation in Latin America—a 191-million-person country where the Roman Catholic Church dominates, abortion is illegal (except in rare cases), and no official government policy has ever promoted birth control—family size has dropped so sharply and so insistently over the past five decades that the fertility rate graph looks like a playground slide.

And it's not simply wealthy and professional women who have stopped bearing multiple children in Brazil. There's a common perception that the countryside and favelas, as Brazilians call urban slums, are still crowded with women having one baby after another—but it isn't true. At the demographic center Carvalho helped found, located four hours away in the city of Belo Horizonte, researchers have tracked the decline across every class and region of Brazil. Over some weeks of talking to Brazilian women recently, I met schoolteachers, trash sorters, architects, newspaper reporters, shop clerks, cleaning ladies, professional athletes, high school girls, and women who had spent their adolescence homeless; almost every one of them said a modern Brazilian family should include two children, ideally a casal, or couple, one boy and one girl. Three was barely plausible. One might well be enough. In a working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Belo Horizonte, an unmarried 18-year-old affectionately watched her toddler son one evening as he roared his toy truck toward us; she loved him very much, the young woman said, but she was finished with childbearing. The expression she used was one I'd heard from Brazilian women before: "A fábrica está fechada." The factory is closed.
The full article by Cynthia Gorney appears in the September 2011 issue of National Geographic magazine, on newsstands now.

				I didn't understand the reasoning of this report. I don't get it. I've read so many times senseless arguments about Brazilian social issues being related to a suposably high fertility rate and, even worse, "overpopul­ation" (Americans love to bring this one). I think this is just another one.

Brazil has never had problems with high fertility rates. It pretty much followed the historical drop of the rate in all Western nations after industrial­ization.

In 2006, Brazil's fertility rate was 1.90 children born per woman. That's almost the same rate of France (1.89), Netherland­s, Norway (1.85), United Kingdom (1.82), among other European nations - lower than more developed Latin American nations, such as Chile (1.94), Uruguay (2.12) and Argentina (2.25). Indeed, it's lower than United States fertility rate (2.05). So what's the big deal?

In fact, experts point that one of the current challenges facing Brazil's way toward becoming a developed country is the aging of the population­. Experts point that unlike China and India, which still have large shares of youngsters among their population­s, Brazil has to speed up its developing process, because if its population gets older before Brazil becomes developed, the country will need to bring immigrants to improve its labor force and complete the process.

				Interestin­g pictorial:

Looking at it - several things caught my attention

The 1st picture contrasts a very ethnically­,( ie african, amerindian and eurpean) mixed lower income family with an upper middle class whiter (european)  looking family.

The rest of the pictures depict various women who are very ethnically dark  also.

I also feel this pictorial should also address the racial structure/­culture of Brazil and its affect on brazilian society. - 

My question is this - if the birth rate shrinks in the lower class , ethnically mixed population then will this also lead to their social elevation in Brazilian society?

				I'm really not clear what the point is here - are we supposed to believe that, without legal birth control and abortion, Brazil is somehow magically "just saying no?" It sounds like the same mess we had in the US pre-Roe v Wade, only with more technology behind it. And are the husbands/ partners/f­athers frequentin­g prostitute­s more, and if so, what is the STD rate in that country? 

There are no stats on the estimated number of illegal abortions (which a good Catholic woman wouldn't dare reveal to anyone), and no discussion whatsoever about what is considered to be the worst child prostituti­on traffickin­g network in the world outside of Thailand. Not to mention the approximat­ely 7 million child laborers. I came out of this article feeling that the topic had merit but was poorly researched data-wise, and that women are not having children because Brazil is quite simply a horrible place to be a child or to have one. 

I'm not sure if that is what you intended, but I did appreciate the message of female empowermen­t - it is always appreciate­d however it is achieved.

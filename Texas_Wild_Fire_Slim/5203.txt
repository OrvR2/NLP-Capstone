Military raises alert level ahead of September 11By Phil Stewart, Jeremy Pelofsky and Andrea Shalal-Esa | Reuters – 8 hrs ago





WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Wednesday raised its alert levels at U.S. military bases, most of them domestic, ahead of the 10th anniversary commemorations of the September 11, 2001, attacks on Sunday.
But it said its decision to heighten force protection levels at military installations, including the Pentagon building itself, was not due to any specific information about a credible terrorism threat.
"This is not in response to any particular threat but is a prudent and precautionary measure," said Pentagon spokesman George Little. The Pentagon said the move takes effect on Wednesday and will continue through Sunday.
The Pentagon was among the targets of the September 11, 2001, attacks, in which al Qaeda militants hijacked four airliners and killed almost 3,000 people. Two of the planes hit the World Trade Center in New York, one hit the Pentagon, and a fourth plane crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
U.S. security officials are being especially vigilant as the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks approaches.
The State Department issued a "Worldwide Travel Alert," saying Americans traveling and living abroad should be aware of the continued threat posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates.
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Wednesday there have been no credible threats against the United States for the September 11 anniversary.
Documents discovered in Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, after he was killed in a raid in May by Navy SEALs highlighted his persistent interest in attacking the United States around the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. But it's unclear those plans ever evolved beyond aspiration.
"As you all have seen, the 10th anniversary of 9/11 was mentioned in the documents seized at the Abbottabad compound," Little said.
"Now this does not suggest in any way, shape or form that we know about a specific or credible threat to the United States homeland surrounding the 10th anniversary."
One U.S. law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said officials were taking very seriously the possibility of attacks by lone individuals, even though no specific threat had been identified.
"If you study the psychology of terrorists, anniversaries are really important to them," said the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.
The official said current plans called for increasing the presence of uniformed law enforcement officers at public events, and changing current surveillance routines.
"Part of disrupting terrorism is changing the way you do things every day. These people are very methodical. They will do research and watch, so changing routines is a useful way to thwart an attack because it will throw them off."

should read "zionists raise alert level" so they can ramp up security to keep any embarrassing moments on live tv from happening , like first responders marching to ground zero demanding truth.

Larry Silverstein was the owner at the time of the  so called "attacks"  he just so happend to take out insurance on all of those buildings. Just incase a "terrorist" attack should happen only 2 months before this catastrophe. Jee I wonder how much insurance money all those buildings were worth?

Who would you rather be ruled by, demonkrats or moslems ? A military coup is the best thing we can hope for at this point, because frankly I would prefer the moozies to the demonics. It's a no win.

Some of the posts here really are hilarious. So 'terrorism' appears to be exclusive domain of 'the Muslims', and the USA doesn't commit terrorism at all, nosirree. Hum. Osama Bin Laden spent most of the 1990s trying to convert the world's Muslims to a more extreme version of their faith, which he largely failed to do. The USA, on the other hand, has managed to convert millions of otherwise moderate Muslims into extremists, with its psychotically aggressive policies in Afghanistan & Iraq. It could be argued that the US government was and still is Bin Laden's (and al-Qaeda's) most indispensable ally. 

Let's do a comparison. Number of American civilians killed by Muslims=around 3000.

Number of Muslims civilians killed by the USA=around 600,000 and counting. 

Who are the terrorists again?

Why is the alert level raised...again??  Well, look at here:  126 indictments have been handed out in the last two years by our super ultra-liberal Attorney General Eric Holder himself for terrorism. And guess what?????  Each and every person indicted…has been…a…wait for it…wait for it…a Muslim!  Gee...what a shock!

Ahhh...you cannot be a "good" Muslim and a "good" American at the same time...it is one or the other.  Islam and Freedom go like oil and water...they will NEVER mix.  You know it and anybody that has studied your 1,400 years of Islamic terror knows it too!

People of America, give up all your liberties and stop acting like Americans, or else me and my boogie-man buddies are going to GET YOU!
You must give up your freedom NOW so that your government can keep you safe.
..uh, hold on a minute. Actually, we hate you BECAUSE of your freedom. So maybe you shouldn't give up your freedom?  Oh, man.. I'm so confused. I wish I paid more attention in Osama's Terror 101 class..
Oh yeah..now I remember. We're attacking you guys to get us some virgins! Sadly, the girls at the strip clubs we like to go to before any of our martyrdom operations are NOT virgins, no matter how may beers we drink!

Look...MUSLIM terrorists only have to be right ONCE and since we still allow them to live amongst us, we have to be right ALL of the time...actually, the cost of allowing Muslims to live here (like a Trogan horse) is bankrupting us...Transportation Security Administration, Homeland Security, the Iraq war, the Afghanistan war, all that so-called terrorist work by the FBI, rebuilding the World Trade Center and who knows what else!!  All for the PC culture we live in!

The Obama administration's "War on Terror" by any name-has failed for a simple reason. It is because there is no such a thing as war on terror. Terrorism is a technique, a method, a weapon, a means to an end. Terrorism is not an enemy that can be named or identified, much less fought effectively. A "War on Terror" is a war on shadows, a war on nothing and on no one.  It is a fool's errand.  Terrorism is the “How”, the “WHO” are true and devoted MUSLIMS and the “WHY” is the cult ideology called ISLAM!

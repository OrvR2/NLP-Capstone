Actually, I am more amazed that there are people in that remote area than that there are ice-bergs there.  How do they make a living and get to live THERE ?

Ice Island ?    Its called Iceberg !!!  and the have been happening since "global warming" started to set the ice-age glaciers back 10,000 years ago.  Don't worry, they will be back again, and we won't worry about global warming, but of the next ice-age to come, perhaps in the next 10,000 years from now.

When ice flows its global warming.  When ice doesn't flow its global warming.  When it is hot it because of global warming.  When it is colder it is only weather!  Doesn't anybody see the lack of logic in these arguments?

Before this video, I thought the Canadian news system was more free than the corporate controlled US media. Well, there was absolutely no mention of how worrisome this is. Beautiful yes. But wake up people! How can they not see that this is a big problem, warning sign in their back yard of what our activities are causing. Nature is kind & hasn't hit us over the head yet but has given us time to change this, if we can see thru the media blitz that keep us drugged by entertainment & consumption. 
WTF Beautiful but taking pics in front of it borders on obscene. It's similar to people posing in front of the fires of Vancouver riots. Well it is truly appropriate they did take pics in front of these glaciers because it is our impervious clueless attitudes that have lead to this crisis & 'fuel' the refusal to face it. Oblivious & oblivion go hand in hand it seems.

It's beautiful? It's a big hunk of ice, although I often think the same thing when i stare at the ice cubes in my crown and coke.

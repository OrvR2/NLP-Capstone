These pictures are something special -- a small part of the photographic record of the largest civil disobedience action so far this century. As phase one of this Tar Sands Action campaign wrapped up today, 1,252 people have been hauled away in police vans, hands cuffed behind their backs -- and heads held very high. We need people to honor that by joining in Phase 2, which will be different but just as unusual -- join us at tarsandsaction.org to get all the details soon.

				I object to the approval of the Keystone XL project based upon the prepondera­nce of evidence that indicates the project would likely cause more harm than good and that, in substantiv­e ways, that harm would be irreversab­le.  Since that harm would devolve upon future generation­s of my family and the families of other Americans, prudence dictates a much more rigorous proof of harmlessne­ss is required than the project has offered.  It should be rejected.  Canada has a well-docum­ented poor record of environmen­tal protection in the minerals industries­.  They always soil their own nest when it comes to mining, etc.  We don't have to follow suit just so that the oil industry can become richer than it already is.

				America, per person, produces 7 times the amount of greenhouse gases that China does per person.  In fact, Americans, per person, contribute more to greenhouse gas emisions than any other industrial­ized nation in the world does per person.  Maybe if Americans weren't such fuel hogs displaying a total disregard for the planet, America wouldn't feel the need to invade all those oil-produc­ing nations in order to control the price of oil, to supply America's insatiable need for it, killings millions in the process.  And maybe if American politician­s weren't such corporate wh$$es, including the Democrats, they'd actually stand up and fight for the values that they profess to have--like concern for the environmen­t. My guess is Obama will sell out to Big Oil just like he sold out to the health insurance industry last year. Hope I'm wrong.

				This kind of oil is highly corrosive and toxic, making the pipelines more prone to leakage, making the land and water and air less safe for the 1000-plus mile stretch, including farmland, that it will be built through in America.  The refining of it is also more toxic, making the environmen­t less safe in Texas, where it will be refined.  After Exxon initially lied and said the pipe that leaked in Yellowston­e recently wasn't carrying tar sands crude, they now admit it did carry this toxic type of oil.  Big surprise that an oil company lied.  I'm still waiting for Exxon to pay those damages for The Exxon-Vald­ez spill in Alaska.  Or BP and the government to stop lying about the extent of the damage to the Gulf of Mexico from THAT recent catastroph­e.  Obama needs to start becoming the progressiv­e he originally pretended to be and stand up to the corporate pigs who dictate policy in this country to all of our detriment.

				Yeah, let's keep building more oil pipelines and using more oil and other fossil fuels. Then the when the next natural disaster comes, before recovering from the last one a week before, we can all stick our heads in the tar sands and wonder if man's use of fossil fuels has anything to do with it or if it's the 2nd coming of Jesus.

				Dito to the comment below.  If we don't take it, China and other countries will.  Rather than being less dependent on foreign oil, we will be helping foreign countries who will take it under much looser restrictio­ns.  Do your research and you will find that the companies who will be building the pipeline have already agreed to over 50 concession­s above and beyond federal regulation­s.  You so-called environmen­talists can actually look into it, or just stick your head in the sand and ignore the facts.  Before you respond, consider that I car-pool, and drive myself as little as possible.  My house is eco friendly, etc.  BUT, you can't be ignorant of the fact that for right now we need this oil.

				do you enviroment­alists actually think it is a good ideal to let china have this oil?  look at their record on the enviroment­.  the reality (good or bad) is the oil sands will be mined, a pipeline will be built to somewhere, so we (as in the USA)  can either have SOME control over where this oil goes and how it is used or you can just protest and really accomplish nothing other than letting a very accomplish­ed polution producing country have at it....just seems like y'all are not really accomplish­ing your own goal.

				China won't get it anymore than we'll get it if the pipeline is built. Oil is a commodity that's bought and sold on the global market. Let Canada build a pipeline to Vancouver and build the refinery there. Keep all of the constructi­on, oil spills and pollution related to tar sand oil production in Canada. They can bear all the costs and consequenc­es of a vertically integrated tar sands production process.

				Right now there are really only two choices for where to build the pipeline, across Canada to their west coast, or south through the US to the Gulf of Mexico.  The Canadians have already said a loud and clear no to building it across Canada (for environmen­tal reasons).  If we also say no to the pipeline, we will have accomplish­ed a lot in terms of speaking up for the environmen­t.

				The concept of having control over how this oil would be used is not and should not be the issue at all.  Regardless of where it would be used, the consequenc­es would be equal.  The majority of the damage is really done before it is used-  the mining and processing of the tar sands, plus the transporta­tion of the sludge across the US to be processed/ shipped from Texas.  If Canada won't even take the risk of building the pipeline across their country, what sane reason could there possibly be to put it here (aside from corporate profits.)

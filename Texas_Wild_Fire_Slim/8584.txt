   Ergotron’s Sit-Stand Desk Expands Choices for Healthier ComputingPRWeb – 50 mins ago





   Ergotron’s WorkFit Workstations Increase Employee Productivity While Helping Lower Health Risk FactorsSt. Paul, Minn (PRWEB) September 08, 2011  Embracing the challenge to help businesses lower the health risk factors facing the knowledge workforce worldwide, Ergotron, a global leader in technology mounting and mobility solutions, has introduced its first sit-stand desk for the home or business office, the WorkFit-D. Offering maximum height-adjustment, the WorkFit-D Desk supports healthy movement in work routines, helping to reduce harmful impacts of sitting disease, particularly in knowledge-based workers who sit long hours in front of a computer. With the introduction of the desk to Ergotron’s WorkFit portfolio—which includes the WorkFit-S surface mount and recently redesigned WorkFit-C mobile solution—companies now have a complete range of affordable sit-stand options to meet individual user preference and corporate wellness requirements. 
“Often cited as the number one culprit facing the corporate workforce, back and shoulder pain play havoc with workplace productivity, not to mention employee health,” said Joel Hazzard, president and CEO at Ergotron. “Providing employees the option to sit or stand as they choose and their body demands throughout the day helps promote healthy movement and lessens body discomfort at their workstation where employees spend the majority of their time.” 
The WorkFit-D Sit-Stand Desk is designed with Ergotron’s patented Constant Force Technology, giving users 20” (51 cm) of height adjustment that is instantaneous, effortless, non-motorized and tool-free. The integrated brake secures the spacious 23” x 48” (59 x 122 cm) worksurface in place and releases with a simple touch. Additionally, the WorkFit-D, designed to incorporate a user’s existing mounting solution or adjustable mounting stand or arm, accommodates the broadest range of user heights. Available for global resale in October, the WorkFit-D Sit-Stand Desk has an MSRP of US$899. To view the WorkFit-D in action, watch Ergotron’s latest video “WorkFit-D: Business as UNusual.”
“We’ve been offering businesses a solid base of ergonomic sit-stand workstations for over fifteen years,” said Hazzard. “With the WorkFit line, we now can more fully address the healthier computing needs of every market we serve, including consumer, commercial, education and healthcare. That’s what the Just Stand Wellness Uprising is all about.”   
Ergotron launched the Just Stand Uprising via http://juststand.org in 2010 to educate companies and the global knowledge worker about the inherent risks of sitting too long—at the computer, in meetings or during the daily commute. Recent research shows that engaging in sit-stand computing offers the user additional caloric burn, improvements in bone density, strengthens leg, ankle and foot muscles, improves balance and alertness, increases good HDL cholesterol levels, reduces bad LDL, and more. 
“The fundamental notion behind a sit-stand workstation is that it engages all human physiological systems,” said Andrew Wood, an injury prevention and wellness specialist in Rochester, Minnesota, “including musculoskeletal, neurological, cardiovascular and biochemical functions to promote alertness, productivity and of course optimum health.” 
Find all the research and news about sitting disease, and supporting tools and videos at http://juststand.org, or join the global Just Stand Uprising with members in more than fourteen countries.

January 21, 2010--COLLEGE STATION, Texas--Tom G. Boggus has been named sole finalist for director and state forester of Texas Forest Service, the agency where he has worked for nearly three decades. A member of The Texas A&M University System, Texas Forest Service is tasked with protecting and sustaining the state’s trees, forests and related natural resources. Texas A&M System Chancellor Michael D. McKinney recommended Boggus upon the recommendation of Dr. Mark A. Hussey, Vice Chancellor & Dean for Agriculture and Life Sciences, as the sole finalist for the post. The designation was approved today by the Texas A&M System Board of Regents. State law requires regents to now wait 21 days before formally offering the job to Boggus. Boggus has served as the agency’s interim director since June 2008. He previously held several administrative positions including forester, associate director for Administration and associate director for Forest Resource Development and Sustainable Forestry. The leader of Texas Forest Service serves a dual role as both director of the agency and state forester charged with ensuring natural resources are protected and sustained. The director oversees the enforcement of laws pertaining to the protection of the land and its resources, and the prevention and extinguishing of wildland fires. The director also monitors the state of the forests, recommends and implements plans for the future of forestry and testifies to legislature the agency’s critical messages, needs and success stories. Boggus’ appointment, if formally approved next month by regents, would make him the eighth director of Texas Forest Service, administering an annual budget of more than $65 million and overseeing more than 365 employees across the state.  Contact:Linda Moon979-458-6606979-450-1160lmoon@tfs.tamu.edu

While "La Migra" agents are often demonized as heartless or unfeeling, in a series of interviews with HuffPost LatinoVoices,  a more diverse picture of their ranks emerges.
“I was twenty-two years old, and I have never had more fun in my life,” said Kent Lundgren, Chairman of the National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers. Lundgren loved the years he spent patrolling the El Paso border. “You think of yourself as a man-tracker, a man-catcher. And you try not to let it go to your head, but that’s how young men think. And then you grow up, and you realize it’s serious stuff,” he said in a phone interview with The Huffington Post.
If Lundgren was born in Mexico, he’d try to cross the border illegally, he said. He believes the vast majority of the immigrants who cross our borders are good and hard-working people. He has a profound sympathy for the men and women he once chased, but simultaneously a determination to keep them out of his country. Lundgren believes illegal immigration is not in the national interest, and spends his days of retirement pushing for harsher enforcement policies-- such as the strengthening of pending E-Verify legislation.
Lundgren's case exemplifies a tension inherent to the experience of many border patrol agents. On a day-to-day basis, patrol agents get to know those they chase, learn their language and often come to sympathize with their plight. 
CHANGE OF HEART
Steve Cribby, a spokesperson for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, told HuffPost that having compassion, is part of the skill set necessary to being a good border patrol agent.
For certain agents, having compassion has meant having a change of heart. John Randolph became a border patrol agent when he was 27 because the job paid well and allowed him to speak Spanish. But Randolph's experience as a border patrol agent led him to become an immigrant rights activist. He wrote about his change of heart in a blog post for The Huffington Post last week:
In my 26 years as a U.S. Border Patrol/ICE Agent, I caught many people. At the time, common sense told me that the vast majority of the people who I caught were good, hardworking people. I began to wonder why immigrants had to be chased like animals, and why I was being paid to chase them.
 Randolph quickly realized there were big problems with his position. "It was a hard job, because I knew I was hurting people," he said. Interacting every day with border-crossers made him question the entire premise of the immigration system. "It just didn't make any sense to me why we'd be punishing people who were here to pick our vegetables," he said.
Randolph describes most of his fellow agents as "compassionate people" who felt bad for those they were chasing. He says a few agents had "power trip stuff with racism mixed in," but the vast majority got into their line of work because they wanted a secure job. "We'd go do it for the whole day and then go home and try to forget about it," he said.
Randolph, now retired, spends his days playing music and speaking out against the governments he believes are responsible for a flawed immigration system. By his estimate, he spends nearly four hours every day reading immigration news. "It's taken me a long time to put my finger on it. But, I'm retired now, and I've had time to investigate it further to see why our system is fundamentally broken," Randolph said.
Randolph's longtime friend and fellow retired border patrol agent, A.J. Irwin, has also changed his stance on the border and immigration enforcement system. He said empathy for those who cross the border has led him to advocate for alternatives to forced deportations. He claims to have convinced judges to spare many immigrants from deportation, even flouting his chain of command in order to do so. Most border agents, he said, don't let themselves experience compassion in the way he does.
"I think most border patrol agents have compassion, but a large number of them overcome those feelings or have masked them so that they can do their job -- but only because they have to," he said. "They deal in such large numbers, it would be difficult if you didn't mask those feelings."
Irwin describes himself as a "hard-core agent". After getting his start patrolling the border in New Mexico, he hopped around various federal enforcement agencies for more than 20 years. In 1999, he led a task force that targeted and successfully prosecuted the "the largest alien smuggling organization ever dismantled in United States history," as former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno described it.
Irwin believes that above all, the tenets of compassion, common sense and discretion should be at the core of a healthy immigration policy. "The small percentage of the aliens who illegally enter the country or enter legally and become illegally present are not a threat to anyone," he said in an email. "Let's focus on the criminals, terrorists, and bad people." 
LA MIGRA LATINA
Irwin, like half of all border patrol agents, is of Latino descent -- a fact which he believes has informed his sympathy for undocumented Latino immigrants, as well as an understanding of racial profiling. "If someone named A.J. Irwin is stopped without a [driver's] license, I get a ticket," he said. "But if A.J. Martinez [his mother's maiden name] is stopped under the same circumstances, I go to jail for two months before even seeing trial. That's two months in a jail for not having their driver's license. Would that ever happen to a white person in this country? I doubt it," Irwin concluded.
One might guess that Frank Jorge, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally born in Cuba, would be an advocate for immigrant rights. He is not. 
Jorge used to be a member of the vigilante group, the Minuteman Project, and patrolled the U.S.-Mexico border in his spare time. Then he was recruited to spend a month living with illegal immigrants as part of a documentary series called "30 Days" produced by Morgan Spurlock.
For 30 days, Jorge, referred to as "Frank George" in the episode, lived in cramped quarters with seven members of the Gonzalez family, who came to the United States illegally to find work. Every day, Jorge accompanied Mr. Gonzalez, the breadwinner of the household, to work as a repairman.  Jorge even made a trip to Mexico to visit the Gonzalezs' hometown to see the conditions in which the family used to live.
The episode depicts a change in Jorge's once stringent views on illegal immigration. In the opening of the episode, Jorge says he had thoughts about calling an ICE bus to come pick up the family within 30 seconds of his arrival. By the end of the episode, Jorge looks into the camera and says, "Perhaps what we learned is that first and foremost, we are human beings, and that's the thing that overrides politics and everything else." He tells the eldest Gonzalez daughter Arminda, who is undocumented, that he will not return to the border as a Minuteman. He says he has gained "another perspective," and agrees to help the family members gain legal residence by attesting for their character.
But, Jorge now maintains that his change of opinion was mostly fabricated by the television show's producers. In a phone interview with HuffPost, he said he still considers himself a Minuteman and is now the co-host of "The Frank and Shannon Show," a radio show that advocates mass deportations and "securing that border militarily, with armed soldiers, with orders to shoot." 
What was not fabricated, he claims, was his affinity for the undocumented family he lived with. "They were really lovely people, I loved them -- rather, I love them," he said.
Although Jorge himself is an immigrant and insists that he would "be trying 10 times a day to get over here" if he were on the Mexican side of the border, he says his intellect has driven him to be an advocate of harsher enforcement policies against illegal immigration.
He called the "30 Days" experience "heartbreaking." 
"Emotionally, I felt very divided. I really love these people [the Gonzalez family]. It's a battle between my emotions and my intellect," he said. "Some of us are fortunate enough to have a good brain, and intellect tempers our emotion." 
Jorge is able to separate his emotions from his politics. But for Irwin and Randolph, and other immigration agents, those borders are more difficult to maintain.

				Have you ever witnessed the the tens of thousands of cars, semi trucks, and pedestrian­­s which cross the border going both ways on a daily basis?

I LIVE on the border and just what does putting a FENCE up have to do with sealing the border to ALL traffic. Last time I crossed, we didn't jump the line and drive across the river. The POINT is to stop illegal traffic. I always got a laugh out of fools who objected because a fence would stop cross border traffic because in all my years, I NEVER saw wet shoppers from Mexico at the malls.

				@randyjet

I always laugh when fools think more fences are going to really stop anything. 

You are right.  The cross border traffic is seldom if ever stopped, and that is exactly my point.  Cross border traffic will always bring people, dope, money and guns into and out of both countries.  Bribery helps that too. 

At this point the US can not afford the technology to thoroughly check every car, person, and truck that comes into the country daily.  The very idea of sealing the border is a joke.  

I walked into El Paso from Juarez a couple of months ago.  They had a metal detecting machine for people to walk through (which is  good).  It would stop people carrying drugs, money, or any other contraband that the machine will not pick up. 

They also don't x-ray all of the cars and they don't have the technology nor man power to do so.    

The only way to effectivel­y seal the border would be have the technology to check everything that crosses both ways.  And for now, It is too important to powers to be to keep the commerce and trade flowing (both legal and illegal).

				Doesn't matter.  If you come here illegally, you're breaking the law and should be sent back to your country.  We have procedures in place to immigrate thru the proper channels.  Line jumpers are not welcome.  I'm in full support of every employer required to screen every current and future employees thru E-Verify system.  If employers continue to hire illegals, then they should pay a very hefty fine for each illegal along with a jail sentence and the company will encure the cost of deporting their illegal employees back to their home country.

				No, civil disobedien­ce is not legal. Which is why MLK was thrown in jail.
They were breaking the law by assembling­. They were constantly breaking Jim Crow laws. Sitting at counters they weren't supposed to, was against the law.

Rosa Parks should have been sitting in the back of the bus, to do differentl­y was against the law. They would have all been tazered in today's police action.

The state said passed legislatio­n against blacks assembling­, The Selma March was technicall­y illegal. They should have went through the courts in Mississppi for a trial by a jury of their peers(haha­h).....

...I'm just saying that laws that are wrong are SUPPOSED to be broken.
If enough people break them, they will no longer be laws.

				Permissive immigratio­n policies ultimately contribute to the misery in Mexico.  As many good, hard-worki­ng people leave, the country seems like it will never become prosperous on its' own.  If we insist that these people remain in their homeland, they could stay and build something great.  There is little motivation to build and maintain your own civilizati­on when you can simply travel to the one next door.  Open border proponents are only superficia­lly charitable­, in the long run, they are keeping Mexico in an eternal state of poverty.

				You are misinforme­d.  Much of the misery in Mexico for common people is caused by the US backed war for drugs there and a failed NAFTA policy.  It is caused by a US backed corrupt government there too.   

The undocument­ed would not leave if the elite who run that corrupt Mexican government and the elite who run the corporate run US government did not conspire together to make it nearly impossible for them to do otherwise.  The would not leave if the US government sanctioned the Mexican government until they took care of their own. 

The rich in the US are in bed with the rich in Mexico, and they have no intentions of ever fixing this problem.  The debate goes on year after year from both sides of the isle.   "Seal the border and deport them all"  vs "give them amnesty and let them stay."    

With the exception of amnesty in 1985, their circular propaganda goes no where while the rich get richer, and the US middle class dies, and the Mexican undocument­ed run for their lives.

				Conspicuou­sly, Canada (despite its' close proximity to the U.S) does not have this problem.  Why?  Also, citizens make choices.  I am not the most wealthy person in the world, I could easily supplement my income by trading in drugs.  I refrain from doing this because I understand that while I may benefit personally from this many people will have misery visited upon them for my actions. People make their societies.

				What a joke. You take a guy who states clearly that he, "believes illegal immigratio­n is not in the national interest, and spends his days of retirement pushing for harsher enforcemen­t policies." And then by the 2nd paragraph jump to a recycled story about the border agent who took 26 years to figure out that he's pro-illega­l that you ran like 3 days ago. I think most people, not just border agents are sympatheti­c to people wanting to come to this country. That doesn't change their support for the rule of law and belief that illegal immigratio­n is wrong and a crime.

				The immigratio­n policy is the problem. If we had an immigratio­n policy in place for these people like the one that had been in place when your own immigrant ancestors arrived here, alpina, then these people would not be "illegal." They would be as legal as your own immigrant people were. During 1880 and 1925, of the 25 million European immigrants who arrived here, only 2% of them were deported (for having a disease, or whatever). The other 98% were welcomed and almost immediatel­y granted "legal" status. As for the first-clas­s immigrant passengers on those incoming immigrant ships, well, they were simply waved right through the system with a pat on the back. How convenient­. Now, that you guys are here, you want to make it impossible for anyone else to come here. Sorry...do­esn't work that way. Get used to it.

				If you're a student of history, and it looks like you are not, it's something of a rule among "historian­s" not to judge previous generation­s by 21st century standards.
When you start doing that,  you distort the role and misreprese­nt the actions of the participan­ts. ie George Washington and all of our founding fathers were racists because they were slaveowner­s. FDR was a racist because he rounded up Japanese Americans and held them  in internment camps for the duration of WWII.

				The united states of america LEGALLY immigrates over 1,000,000 people EVERY YEAR which is more than every other country on the planet allows COMBINED. Unless you have a time machine, talking about 1925 in relation to current policies and laws is moot and without merit. The only thing I plan on getting used to, is an administra­tion who upholds their constituti­onary obligation and enforces the existing immigratio­n laws and prevents our country from a de facto invasion from the south.

				It's funny to read the quote of an arrepentid­o trying to justify his hate based hypocrisy on the issue. It's almost like he wants some white supremacis­t to pat him on the head and say "you're a credit to your race" or "You're different from all them other wet backs". It's the male version of Michelle Malkin. It's a person who hates himself so much that he persecutes those like him for doing what he did. The quote is a real gem:"Some of us are fortunate enough to have a good brain, and intellect tempers our emotion."

				I have, and I don't know what that has to do with empathy for illegals. If you think that either of those two institutio­n are full of illegals you're wrong. There's a small amount of inmates with immigratio­n holds, but it is minimal compared to the total population­. You have even fewer that are intrenched in the hard core prision culture, most just want to do their time and move on.

				Do you mean that every undocument­ed person in the US is the same type of person as the criminal aliens who end up in state prison?  Are you saying that all undocument­ed people are all rapists, drug dealers, and murderers?  

If that is true for you, are you then no different than the prison inmates of your race?

You can't have it both ways and your stereotypi­cal logic is flawed.  

And please, don't compare illegal entry into the US as an equal crime to murder.  An documented person's first time Illegal entry is a misdemeano­r.  It has about as much significan­ce as a traffic ticket for speeding, and is just about as impossible to enforce.

				Thats all swell and wonderful, but the fact is illegal immigratio­n must be stopped. This is not about the character of people coming illegally across the border. Extremist could just as easily slip into the US, and may already have. We have laws against illegally aliens, those people that come here illegally deserve nothing.. should be rounded up and sent back to mexico. Its not the US fault that mexico is not a great place to live or work, and we dont have a open door treaty with mexico to take all that they dont want or who decide not to live here. When they get to the US the illegals start marching to get the rights of people who are here legally. The illegals deserve nothing, no benefits, no emergency room treatment, no health dept. freebies, no enrollment in public schools. Of course they dont want to be identified as illegals for fear of being sent home or singled out, but what else do you do with lawbreaker­s? This is not about good or bad but illegals, theres no blurring the two. Either your here legally or not. mexico awaits, go home.

				I agree, lets stop it.  We have to get to the root of the problem to stop it.

I speak specifiabl­y of Mexico.  The good people of Mexico would not stay or come here if they were paid a decent living wage working with their families at home.  American factories on the border (maquilado­ras) pay them about $10 A DAY to assemble our electronic­s and clothes.  So who profits at whose expense?

No one can live on those wages. 

You want to stop it?  Then organize as US citizens to peacefully protest and force the US government to sanction that corrupt Mexican government until they provide for their own.
If you could clear your mind, we could even align with the undocument­ed to bring our current failed immigratio­n to a halt and make Washington make a decision.

Washington sanctions (for greed) lots of countries.  Why not Mexico?  Is Washington too dependent upon Mexican trade and oil to rock the boat?

This issue is right up there with failed mortgages, failed health care, and the downfall of the US middle class.  They profit while we (and the Mexican people) suffer. 

Look beyond Washington­'s propaganda and rhetoric.  It is designed to keep taxpayers fighting each other and blaming the symptom (undocumen­ted people) and not the cause (the elite's greed)

				Actually many of the maquilador­as have moved oway. They found the Mexican minimum wage to be too high and mexico's few labor laws to be too strict. They went to china or other countries where people will work for even lower wages with no worker protection­s. As for Mexico's agrecultur­e, it's was decimated when nafta took effect. The market was flooded with heavily underprice­d, subsidized American products.

				You know John People like you are the problem not me. You want to ignore the problem of Illegals because you think that's the Humane thing to do.

Take a look at the Prison Population of California­. Now I'm from a Family that settled in Southern California since 1850. My Great grandparen­ts are from Spain and Mexico, my Grandfathe­r was born in Mexico. I have watched as California and the legal 2nd and 3rd Generation­s of Legal Immigrants prosper in School and Business. Now I see the 2nd and 3rd generation­s of Illegals continue to have no health Care no Schooling no chance but working low wage jobs for them and their Children.

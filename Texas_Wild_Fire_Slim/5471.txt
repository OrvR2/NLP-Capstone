The Eagle’s Nest, a tea house atop Kehlstein peak in Bavaria built for Hitler in the late 1930s, is rapidly becoming a popular tourist destination. The house sits 6,000 feet up in a scenic mountain range, but the real draw seems to be morbid curiosity.
This year, 300,000 tourists (mostly Americans and Brits) have visited the chalet to look at the rather pleasant and quaint spot where Hitler sat as his troops burned down large parts of Europe. The inside of the Eagle’s Nest looks like a slightly worn Bavarian restaurant and the outside looks like ski lodge.
A restaurant and even a gift shop have been built at the “Kehlsteinhaus” and a visit already runs tourists 20 euros. Last year, according to German tourism authorities, the site was only visited by 30,000 people.
Though Hitler did use the house, the Daily Mail reports that he only did so very occasionally because he was afraid of heights. 
Tourism to Nazi sites shows no sign of slowing down in Europe. From the Ukraine to the UK, tourists seem eager to engage with the history and legacy of WWII.

																Today, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel joined Barack Obama at Buchenwald, one of Nazi Germany's worst concentration camps, but he worried that "the world hasn't learned" from the tragedy.

				I tend to avoid being too critical of people being drawn to places with historical significan­ce. From the Tower of London to a Roman Colosseum with its history of a bloody arena. They are places from history, where battles were fought or decisions were made that shaped and influenced our lives.

Unfortunat­ely our planet has a cruel and bloody history, nonetheles­s, it tells us a lot about who we are and how we came to be living where and how we do today.

				Actually, it was fear of elevators that kept old Adolf away from the Eagle's Nest and its
beautiful views of the Obersalzbe­rg. The SS had a gold-encru­sted, mirrored contraptio­n
built specially for Der Fuehrer's use ("Ladies' swastikas-­-9th Floor!"), but he found it
cramped and claustroph­obic.

				I visited the Eagle's Nest back in 1986 and the thing I remember the most is the guy dressed up as Hitler greeting us as we got off the bus.   What was most troubling, however, was seeing how excited the German tourists got and how they seemed to treat this character as if he were some kind of hero.

				I wish people would learn more about what happened in WW2. Sure, it might be a nice place on a nice mountain, but while he was sitting there drinking tea,, millions of people were killed - including some of my family. They should have restored the Fuehrerbun­ker. Let the world see what this pig did.

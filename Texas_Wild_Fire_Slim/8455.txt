Crosby to return this season but no timetable setAFP – 15 hrs ago

National Hockey League star center Sidney Crosby is expected to return in the upcoming season, doctors said on Wednesday, but he is not ready yet and no timetable is set for his return.
The Pittsburgh Penguins playmaker, who scored the golden goal for Canada in last year's Vancouver Olympic over-time final against the United States, has not played since suffering a concussion January 5 in a game against Tampa Bay.
"It has been a tough road," Crosby said. "It's not as simple as saying there's a date and I'll feel better. I would love to have answers sometimes. There were different points where I was definitely frustrated."
Michael Collins, the doctor treating Crosby, said the 24-year-old NHL star suffered an injury that affected motion and spacial judgement, such a blow being among the hardest to recover from among concussions.
"We need to make sure Sid is ready to come back with no recurrence of his symptoms," Collins said.
"I have no earthly idea (when he will return). We're going to introduce contact with Sid very carefully and we're not even close to that."
There were fears Crosby might never play again, and while he is not ready to make a quick comeback when the NHL season opens in a month, the Penguins' captain is not calling it quits either.
"Retirement? No," Crosby said. "I've always thought about the consequence of this injury, making sure I'm smart with it, because at the end of the day that is the last thing I want.
"I'm taking my time with recovering from this injury. I didn't give a whole lot of thought to (retirement).
"I'm lucky. I feel like I'm in pretty good shape and on the right end of this right now."
Among the issues Crosby had to deal with was what he termed a "fogginess" that made driving a car or watching a television difficult as well as migraine headaches.
"It's approaching normal limits. It's not there yet, but I was encouraged by what I saw," Collins said.
"I would classify Sid's case in reconditioning mode. He needs to be reconditioned 100 percent. There's no timeline on this. We can't predict when it will occur. But he will be 100 percent normal when he plays."
Crosby was clear that nothing less than a full recovery will result in him once again lacing up the skates.
"Ninety percent is good, but at the same time, if there's symptoms, 90 percent isn't good enough," Crosby said. "I'm putting myself in position to get hit and mess that system up again.
"Maybe I can get by with 90 percent, but I'm not going to roll the dice with that."

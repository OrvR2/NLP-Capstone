   Adhost Internet Completes SSAE 16 Type II Audit of Seattle Data CentersPRWeb – 50 mins ago





   Adhost Internet, a colocation and Web services provider located in downtown Seattle, announced today that it has completed a SSAE 16 Type II audit.Seattle, Washington (PRWEB) September 08, 2011  Adhost Internet, a colocation and Web services provider located in downtown Seattle, announced today that it has completed a Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No.16 (SSAE 16) Type II audit.  SSAE 16, developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), is the most widely recognized authoritative guidance that provides service organizations a uniform method for disclosing independently assessed information about the design and operation of internal controls related to their services.  
The audit was performed by Accell TAC, P.A., a full-service audit and consulting firm that specializes in conducting SSAE 16 audits.  Earlier this year the SSAE 16 replaced SAS 70 (Statements on Auditing Standards No. 70), which Adhost completed in previous years. Compared to SAS 70, SSAE 16 brings US companies up to date with the new international service organization reporting standards, the ISAE 3402.  SSAE 16 audits require a written assertion from management regarding the data center controls and the service auditor’s opinion letter.
Companies who complete an annual SSAE 16 audit of their data center operations are able to demonstrate a substantially higher level of assurance and operationally visibility than those companies who do not. The completion of the SSAE 16 Type II audit typifies Adhost’s continued commitment to create and maintain the most stringent controls needed to ensure the highest quality and security of services provided to their customers.  The Service Auditors’ Report issued by Accell TAC, P.A., with an unqualified opinion, demonstrates that Adhost’s control activities were effectively designed and in operation throughout the reporting period.
"By successfully passing a SSAE 16 Type II audit, as well as SAS 70 Type II audits in previous years, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to proper controls and security in our data centers. All of our data center clients, including publicly traded companies and those in the financial and healthcare industries, benefit from our processes and procedures and are able to use our audit report for their required audits,” states Will Riffle, Adhost President and CEO.
The Service Auditors’ Report includes a detailed description of Adhost’s controls and an independent assessment of whether the controls are placed in operation, suitably designed, and operating effectively.  To receive a copy of the Service Auditors’ Report, or for any further questions, please contact Adhost Sales at sales(at)adhost(dot)com.

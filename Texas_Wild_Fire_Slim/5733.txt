Alexander Skarsgard is definitely taking advantage of his time on the East Coast
The "True Blood" star was spotted enjoying the local scene in the Hamptons over Labor Day weekend.
According to Page Six, the newly single Skarsgard hit up Water Mill’s Stadium Red Estate and Southampton’s South Pointe Saturday night, ordering multiple shots and taking pictures with fans.
But the party didn't stop on Saturday. According to E! Online, Skarsgard was spotted at The Surf Lodge in Montauk Sunday night, posing for even more photos with adoring fans and talking up some very lucky ladies, including Alexandra Keating, who is the daughter of the former Prime Minister of Australia.
The actor and his girlfriend of two years, Kate Bosworth, split in July but the two star in the upcoming "Straw Dogs," which hits theaters September 16.
Skarsgard is currently filming "What Maisie Knew" in New York City and we honestly can't get enough of him. Check out some of our favorite photos below!

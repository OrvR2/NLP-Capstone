May 23, 2011 – WEST TEXAS – Extremely dry, windy conditions in West Texas and the Panhandle are expected to worsen Tuesday, increasing the potential for wildfires. Unprecedented drought conditions across the state, combined with low humidity and high winds, create a perfect storm for wildfires that can spread at a rapid pace, placing lives and property in harm’s way. Extreme caution should be practiced as any spark can be a deadly spark. Since Texas fire season began Nov. 15, Texas Forest Service and area fire departments have responded to more than 10,000 fires that have consumed about 2.7 million acres. Combined efforts of citizens taking proactive actions and a coordinated state response have saved more than 19,000 homes and buildings. You can use Texas Forest Service resources to monitor the current wildfire status and create a wildfire action plan for your home.

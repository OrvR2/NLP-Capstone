         9.14.11]----Just two days ago, at the Tea Party/GOP Presidential debate, candidate Ron PaulRon Paul was asked if he would let an uninsured person die, but I doubt Wolfe Blitzer knew how close to home his question really was. 48-year-old Kent Snyder, Paul's campaign manager and friend, died of pneumonia June 26, 2008, just 2 weeks after Ron paul withdrew his presidential bid. Snyder died broke and uninsured. According to a CNN report, Snyder had no health insurance when he became ill and died leaving a $350,000 medical bill. Senator Ron Paul is consistent in his message that government should not be in the business of helping Americans with services like health insurance, which should instead be left to churches, charitable organizations and friends. In fact, the Libertarian candidate thinks the government should stay out of every aspects of our lives: FEMA, Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security should all be abolished -- a "let the masses fend for themselves" kind of approach. He said his supporters raised about $50,000 to help the gravely ill Snyder with medical care. When asked what he, Ron Paul, did personally for his friend, he avoided giving a straight answer by saying, "I did everything I could...he was cared for." But he died, Senator. According to Paul's ideology, I guess, the system worked beautifully. What do you think of Paul's ideology uncannily playing out with his sick firend?        1 of 34

"Let'em Die"You should not attribute the audience's comment to Ron Paul. You know that is not true and irresponible journalism. Worse yet, its is too easy for your readers to call you on...If you will pardon the pun, Paul is "dead" right on big goverment health care in this case. I will try and expand for you if I can, on what many people believe who support Paul.I am sure we all hope and agree, that those shouting from the audience, "whose affiliations we can not know," do not themselves find a need for the kind of help and compassion someday our hypothetical 30 year old needs.This issue is not complicated it has only been made so by special interest. And yes, government bureaucracies are special interests too! Their job is to sustain or grow themselves and maintain their own jobs.Rhetoric aside, we all know the hypothetical man here will get treatment if for no other reason than the compassion of our great doctors and their own Hippocratic Oath. That has always been the way in America. Americans are a compassionate people already.Now the question defining how these costs should be paid for?Re-empowering our religious and other private charities through tax incentives provided to their donors is the simple answer. It is a free market approach that creates all the benefits of free market checks and balances. You create accountability here where there is little in government bureaucracy, especially one as large as to deal with this challenge nation wide. Charities get donors by doing good work and good work attracts "tax incented" donors to give support. As a culture we need to get back to looking to ourselves and our neighbors rather than putting faith in a far off federal government to handle challenges that are literally right in front of us locally.Localization should be reflected in the urging of our States to take back jurisdiction on issues that can be dealt with creatively at the state level. Empowering all 50 states & 1000’s of communities nationwide to solve these important issues we will create innovation that would be sought modified and perfected throughout the nation just as is done in any true free market. The benefits are undeniable and give us all the greatest opportunity to participate in real compassion in our country.Today a group of people lifted a burning car from a man and saved his life. People saw the need banded together and helped their neighbor the concept is the same. Where would that man be if they all just waited for the government to solve that? How successful would they have been and in the end what would it have cost?Those people created direct action to a problem in front of them in their community. They created a positive and successful outcome and it cost only the compassion in there hearts to do it. I’ll bet it made them feel good too!!!We can do this America! He may not be slick, but he is correct about many of these things and seldom gets his full message out through the corrupt media. Do not let the media machine be judge and jury on Ron Paul. Take back your liberty and your country.Here is an article on media consolidation from 2004 by Ted Turner –My Beef With Big Media http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0407.turner.htmlI do not support all Turner’s politics but, commend him as a great American entrepreneur in writing this article after selling to Time Warner.The MSM achieved power by successfully lobbing for changes allowing mass consolidation. Ron Paul threatens this. Other candidates and the president supported this consolidation and are beholden to one corporation or the other. Therefore, you will most likely never hear ideas like this discussed in open debate. "Now more than ever liberty needs advocates." With the American free press, an essential part of a successful democracy, all but dead, we must all be vigilant now.Do the American people really care if Goldman Sachs let's General Electric (Obama/Biden) or Halliburton (Bush/Cheney "insert Perry or Romney here") run the place this time? I guess that's yet to be seen. But, I can tell you many of us traditionally Non-politicals are fed up with losing the essence of our great country to communists and carpetbaggers alike.Ron Paul is offering an alternative to the corporatist model that Eisenhower warned of, and has all but taken over already. A vanished free press has left us with the left and right media outlets complicit in keeping Paul's message from a waiting public.If not Ron Paul we will surely end up with Clint Webb as president. So you must continue spread the word, educate your busy family, friends, and neighbors to spend an “honest hour” looking at Paul and convey the importance of Ron Paul getting that republican slot. Switch parties if you have to…"First they ignore you, then they fight you, then you win."-Gandhi-They are beginning to fight… Make no mistake this is a fight for your very freedom and the fate of American liberty.The Government has too much, does too much, and in our high tech world now, knows far too much about the lives of private citizens and we are paying for it all...This can not stand it is not necessary and the temptation for corruption is far too great."They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."- Ben Franklin –Peace!

Kent Snyder was 'uninsurable' due to pre-existing conditions. The pneumonia was an added complication to his illness. The fact that he did not have insurance is not what killed him. He received care in spite of not having insurance because there is a law that Reagan put in place that no one can be turned away from treatment for life threatening illness. Instead of having the bill that remained after his passing being paid for by the government ( yours and my taxes)caring people came together to help pay it voluntarily. Dr.Paul is a compassionate and humble person who would not want to disclose or use for political points how much he personally contributed to help his friend. It would be illegal to transfer funds from a campaign for this purpose. If anything, the Kent Snyder story just shows that Dr. Paul stands by his beliefs.

A lot of people will die if Republicans get their way. It's really uncivilized. Funny, the ones hollering the loudest about letting people die if they can't afford health care think they're really tough, rugged individualists but most of the ones I know are soft, weak, pasty butterballs in terribly poor health themselves. They better be careful what they wish for...

"According to a CNN report, Snyder had no health insurance when he became ill and died leaving a $350,000 medical bill."The size of the bill indicates he was indeed treated at the hospital, and died, not because of a lack of health insurance, but due to physical complications of pneumonia, which were unable to be successfully treated, which happens to people with or without health insurance.

It's just sad that Ron Paul had to see first hand what happens to someone who is uninsured die right in front of his eyes.But I seriously doubt that the same could be said of the rest of the 45 million uninsured Americans who fall right into this category.I seriously doubt Ron Paul would actually *care* of all 45 million were to die right in front of his eyes right now. Because why? He thinks that they are undeserving of *any* help whatsoever.And he would probably find their deaths funny as hell as the rest of the Tea Party did during that recent debate.

"It's just sad that Ron Paul had to see first hand what happens to someone who is uninsured die right in front of his eyes."Because of legislation passed by Reagan, nobody can be turned away from a hospital Emergency Room... the person in question didn't die because of the lack of insurance; they died from complications associated with pneumonia, and likely in the hospital at the time...

these republicans are different than the Reagan era republicans. The T party has always been about stirring up dissension and dividing the country rather than uniting it. They are truly heartless and completely comfortable throwing away the Christian values they pretend to possess. Jesus said help the poor, not throw them under the bus and watch them die.

itobin53, I guess the new breed of Republicans really do embrace the law of Evolution, after all - now it's all about survival of the fittest. Who'd a thunk it, they USED to be self-professed Christians!

The neocons and neolibs both right and left cheering for more wars have no problem throwing hundreds of thousands of innocents including women and children 'under the bus'. To them and those that support our current foreign policy life seems only valuable to save if it is American. Oh, wait those deaths are now called 'collateral damage'.

My Dad had excellent insurance but he died anyway. Insurance does not keep you from dying and lack of does not make you die. Snyder died from his illness, not from lack of insurance. He was uninsurable due to preexisting conditions, however, he did recieve care just like anyone does when they have a life threatening illness- it is against the law for a hospital to turn anyone away based on ability to pay. Reagan passed that law decades ago.

the fact is that lack of insurance puts a person at increased risk of dying - why? because when you have no insurance you will put off going to seek medical attention longer, as the fear of sinking into debt and dying owing money is a huge stressor, which in turn causes more illness, so saying that they all know they will not get turned away at the hospital is no great consolation when you are the one walking in, sick and ill, and essentially a beggar...because if you go in knowing you can't pay something and you are a person of integrity - well believe it or not Republicans, that really does bother some people - in fact it makes them sick.

Wow Veronica your story started quite a debate. I have one comment on it though. When you do go to the ER and are not insured and no job, they write prescriptions you can't afford to pay for. That is one problem I have ran into before. I was never turned down for getting help it is after care that one cannot get. Rate up

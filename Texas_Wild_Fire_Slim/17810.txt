Central Texas Wildfire Burns Hundreds of HomesUpdated: Tuesday, 06 Sep 2011, 1:29 PM CDTPublished : Monday, 05 Sep 2011, 10:06 AM CDT

BASTROP, Texas - At least 476 homes are destroyed and more than 25,000 acres are burned in a raging wildfire southeast of Austin, according to the Texas Forest Service. The latest numbers were announced around 3:45 p.m. The fire started in the Lost Pines area, jumped the Colorado River twice and is not contained, Texas Forest Service spokeswoman Jan Amen told the Austin-American Statesman. Instead, the state was scrambling its firefighting air fleet, including National Guard helicopters and four heavy tanker planes. It also was bringing in a tanker from South Dakota. The Bastrop County Office of Emergency Management ordered the evacuation of hundreds of people and kept posting more evacuations on its   Facebook page.   In nearby Steiner Ranch, at least 25 homes were destroyed. Its residents also started a   Facebook page   to spread information about school closings, neighborhood evacuations, and more. The Bastrop blaze was the largest of dozens of wildfires burning throughout the state, including 63 that had started since Sunday. Texas is enduring its worst drought since the 1950s, and the wildfire threat has been exacerbated by powerful wind gusts cast off by Tropical Storm Lee, hundreds of miles to the east. The fires led Gov. Rick Perry to cut short a visit to South Carolina and cancel a planned trip to California, Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for his Republican presidential campaign, said in a statement. Among Texas' many weekend fires was one more than 200 miles to the northeast, in Gladewater, where a 20-year-old woman and her 18-month-old daughter were killed Sunday when they were unable to escape from a fast-moving blaze that consumed their mobile home. That fire was eventually extinguished. "Today is just as bad," Amen said Monday. No injuries were reported from the Bastrop County fire near Austin, but several subdivisions were ordered evacuated on Sunday after it broke out. Authorities hadn't determined how it started. Nearly half of Bastrop State Park, a 6,000-acre preserve east of Bastrop, was gone, KVUE-TV in Austin reported. "It's huge," a woman at the park office who declined to identify herself said Monday from the park office. "It's all over." The park and several major highways in the area were closed but a handful of people whose RV's were left overnight in the popular park were being allowed in to retrieve them, she said. Texas has experienced more than its share of destructive storms, including Hurricane Ike three years ago. But the state's anxious farmers and ranchers would have welcomed the rain that Tropical Storm Lee dumped instead on Gulf Coast states further east. Instead of water, Texas got winds, which combined with an advancing cold front to heighten the wildfire threat. All but three of the 254 counties in Texas were under outdoor burn bans. A wildfire in the Austin suburb of Cedar Park destroyed two homes and damaged two others Sunday. Wildfires also prompted evacuations of other neighborhoods in Cedar Park and some in some suburbs.

   Magma Announces Three-Slot Expansion Chassis for Thunderbolt™ TechnologyPRWeb – 10 hrs ago





   The sleek design of Magma's ExpressBox 3T, their first Thunderbolt to PCI Express® expansion chassis, will be revealed at Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco (Sept 13-15).  ExpressBox 3T provides an 'outside-the-box' solution for using PCIe® cards with Thunderbolt-equipped computers. High-performance flows are possible by connecting a Thunderbolt equipped computer to a Magma ExpressBox 3T containing PCIe cards such as video capture, media transcoding, audio processing, and fast data storage. And because Thunderbolt is also based on DisplayPort technology, you can daisy chain a high-resolution display with your Magma ExpressBox 3T.San Diego, CA (PRWEB) September 07, 2011  Magma, an innovative and visionary developer of PCI Express® connectivity products, introduces ExpressBox 3T, an expansion chassis with three PCIe slots and a lightning fast connection through Thunderbolt.  The introduction of Thunderbolt technology is a great opportunity for Magma to support the next generation of “outside the box” high-speed connectivity.  Magma’s ExpressBox 3T provides an easy, rock solid migration path to newer and faster computers while protecting the customers’ investment in specialized PCI Express peripherals made for video capture and edit, broadcast video, pro audio, communications, data acquisition and more.
Developed by Intel® with collaboration from Apple, Thunderbolt is a high-speed I/O technology running at 10Gbps per channel that brings together high-speed data transfer and high-definition (HD) display on to a single cable.  High performance workflows are possible by connecting a Thunderbolt equipped computer to a Magma ExpressBox 3T containing PCIe® cards for video capture, media transcoding, audio processing, and fast data storage. And because Thunderbolt is also based on DisplayPort technology, a high-resolution display can be daisy chained with your Magma ExpressBox 3T.
. 
“ExpressBox 3T is the first Magma expansion product specifically made for Thunderbolt-equipped computers.  Now, with Thunderbolt technology, mobile, and all-in-one customers have easy access to the fastest I/O technology available today,” says Randy Jones, CEO and President at Magma.  “ExpressBox 3T is a “must-have” expansion solution for media creators.  Magma retains its leadership position by continuing to introduce cutting edge technology for media production and other computing professionals.”
Product Information 
ExpressBox 3T is a sleek anodized silver chassis with three PCIe 2.0 slots, a cooling fan, a 220W internal power supply, and travel bag for easy transportation.  ExpressBox 3T and up to six Thunderbolt devices can be daisy-chained including Thunderbolt and DisplayPort displays.  Magma is actively working with development partners such as Apple, Avid, AJA, Red, ATTO, Fusion-io and Promise Technology to validate application performance with ExpressBox 3T in broadcast video and pro audio environments.

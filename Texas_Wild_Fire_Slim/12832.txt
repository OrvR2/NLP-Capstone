March 25, 2011 – COLLEGE STATION, Texas – Texas Forest Service Fire Behavior Analyst Brad Smith was honored Friday with a Texas A&M University Vice Chancellor’s Award in Excellence. The award was presented by Mark Hussey, Texas A&M AgriLife and Life Sciences vice chancellor and dean, during a celebration in College Station. Smith joined Texas Forest Service as a forester after graduating from Stephen F. Austin State University in 1981. He has studied fire behavior for the agency since 2000 and is considered a leader in his field. “The skill set that Brad has attained over the past few years has allowed him to reach the highest levels of wildland fire analysis capabilities,” said Tom Spencer, Predictive Services department head and Smith’s supervisor. “His accomplishments are evidenced by the demand for his skills at the national, regional and state levels where accurate wildland fire and fuels analysis is needed.”Smith’s job duties involve studying daily fire danger, including drought indices, fuel dryness and weather. The information is used to determine what fire suppression resources and personnel are needed, ultimately securing the safety of residents throughout the state of Texas. “Brad is a true force multiplier and someone you want on your team during the extended fire seasons the state has been going through,” Spencer said. “His actions make a difference, and the state is fortunate to have him in service.” Contacts:Brad Smith, Fire Behavior Analyst903-297-3818, bsmith@tfs.tamu.edu Writer: April Saginor, Communications Specialist979-458-6619 office, 979-255-0591 cell, asaginor@tfs.tamu.edu Texas Forest Service communications staff can be reached after hours at newsmedia@tfs.tamu.edu.

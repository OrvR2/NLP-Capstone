Obama 'to inject $300 bn' in bid to create jobsAFP – Wed, Sep 7, 2011

US President Barack Obama will propose the injection of $300 billion into the sputtering US economy in a pivotal speech laying out his plan to create jobs, US media are reporting.
CNN, citing sources in Obama's Democratic Party, said the plan includes $300 billion in new spending and an equal amount of offsetting cuts, including slashing payroll taxes and extending unemployment insurance.
The Bloomberg news service said the injection would come in the form of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and direct aid to state and local governments.
It said Obama would call for offsetting the cost by raising tax revenues in later years as part of a long-term deficit reduction plan that will include spending and entitlement cuts.
Such a plan would likely face stiff resistance from Obama's Republican foes, who have adamantly rejected any new revenue-raising measures and insisted that both tax and spending cuts will generate jobs and reduce debt.
The new employment initiative Obama will announce to a rare joint session of Congress on Thursday is crucial both to jolting the economy back to life and to replenishing his faded political stock ahead of the 2012 election.

Wow isnt it pathetic as to how the US spends 700 billion dollars on their military? Yet, its not even the best in the world, isnt it sad that they spend 700 billion on their military and not even 200 billion on a useful space program?

Reduce the money spent on arms and wars they've caused and they'd be laughing. Also stop littering space with all their satellites and crap and we'll be even better off. That money could be used much more for the benefit of the ones that need it and to increase manufacturing of worthwhile products for the Americans thus creating a market and jobs. Duh!!!

A drop in the bucket,just delaying another recession....you must make the rich pay their share,cut military spending,stop the corruption with the inside traders who makes billions by getting inside information.Do not bailout firms that loss billions because of bad management.Obama cannot keep pumping money into a dead economy,let the private sector make money,ease off the redtape,make banks lend money instead of hording it.

In Ontario  we have Toyota plants . They came here because there were tariffs and the auto pact which meant that they had to produce product here in order to be able to sell it. I'm sure Toyota would have built somewhere else if these laws weren't in place at the time. Tariffs help balance the scales out between economies . Just check the figures since NAFTA and you'll see a steady loss of our manufacturing jobs in Canada and the US. These were generally decent enough paying jobs that provided disposable income and that allows for discretionary spending and it's the 7 spinoff jobs from every good paying job that we lose that is killing the economy. If you have a plant relocate to mexico and it had employeed say 1000 people,now add 7times 1000 and thats the true job lose. Now add up how many businesses have left just to increase their bottom line and the numbers get ugly in a hurry.

Economies are like pyramid schemes, they require millions of people spending their money which eventually winds up in the hands of the few. This can't be sustained indefinately  and that is where we are today. Money has to get back to consumers and that means disposable income not just minimum wage. Obama can't raise the taxes on the middle and lower classes to help pay the debt only job creation will work. Any stimulus money will wind up in the hands of the few AGAIN and he'll be right back where he started. The Tea Party and Reps say they'll creat jobs by reducing taxes on business and they will come back to the US,that is highly unlikely because there is alot more involved here like pollution laws etc. The only option for them is reduce social spend I.E. healh care,drug plans, pensions,education etc but that still is only a temporary fix. Reinstate tariffs again and watch the companies come back.

All Obama needs to do in the US and harper in Canada is to put tariffs back in place that were removed with NAFTA. If you check since NAFTAwas put in place, you'll find that businesses and jobs left the country because they could make them in Mexico cheap and ship them back with no penalty. Great for the corporations initally but down the road you don't have jobs. That is why this recession is different then the one in the 80's. Our standard of living is way higher then these third world ones and we cannot compete on wages and still purchase goods. Corporations made huge amounts of profit but the economies and jobs now suffer. Time for the scales to balance again or business and the economy won't recover.

Bryan's Kevin Jefferson follows his blockers on a third-quarter touchdown run against Round Rock McNeil on Friday at Merrill Green Stadium.



 
There is safety in numbers. Bryan just needed a few more to feel safe.
The Vikings built a 28-point lead but held on by their fingernails to win their home opener over Round Rock McNeil 35-28 on Friday at Merrill Green Stadium.
"McNeil was persistent, and they hit a few things," Bryan head coach Bob Bellard said. "We played a lot of backups, and it's good for us to get a lot of backups in the football game, but [McNeil] is pretty good."
Bryan generated just 60 yards of offense in the second half but survived when linebacker Tyler Allen sacked McNeil quarterback Zach Kuhn and forced a fumble that Zac Slaydon recovered to tuck away the Vikings' victory.
It was a rare chance for the Vikings to contain Kuhn, who rushed for 164 yards on 26 carries in a quarterback showcase. Bryan's Chris Johnson ran 13 times for 127 yards but was not in position much in the second half to add many yards to his halftime total.
Still, the Vikings pushed a 21-7 lead to 35-7 during one superb stretch of the second half. 
After Kuhn's 8-yard TD run early in the second half gave McNeil its first points, Bryan sophomore Bobby Johnson fielded the ensuing kickoff at his 5-yard line, angled through a hole in the coverage to the right sideline then outran everybody on a 95-yard kickoff return with 7:01 left in the third quarter.
It took 37 seconds for the Vikings to score again. Devin Marshall recovered a fumble to set up a 26-yard TD run by Kevin Jefferson that gave Bryan the 28-point cushion.
"We came out and did the things we wanted to do in the second half," Bellard said. "I thought in both halves we had good bursts. When [McNeil] got a couple of quick ones and got back in the game, we didn't respond at that point. They always made the next play. At the end, we made the next play defensively."
After Jefferson's touchdown, McNeil moved 81 yards in seven plays, capping the drive with a 1-yard run from Jalen Harrell, who finished with 109 rushing yards. 
Bryan's 35-14 lead lulled both teams into believing that the game was well in hand. Or so it seemed, but McNeil's backups didn't get word signaled in to them. With second-team players working for both teams, the Mavericks moved in for a score, getting a 23-yard run by reserve quarterback Jordan Robinson.
"We've got a bunch of kids that we wanted to see get some reps, but it wasn't necessarily because we put those kids in there [that McNeil rallied]," Bellard said. "They made plays, but we had a lot of good players in there that are going to help us somewhere down the road."
Robinson's TD made it a game -- and made both teams send their first-teamers back onto the field. McNeil's starters took the momentum handoff from their backups, while Bryan's offense never recaptured its first-half mojo. 
A short punt set up the Mavericks with a short field, and Kuhn threw to junior Nick Parinella for a 4-yard TD catch just a step into the end zone.
"If you don't do things exactly right, [Kuhn] is going to make the play," Bellard said. "He did that against Midway a week ago. They scored late, but they scored a few too many late. If they had hit two [touchdowns], it would have been one thing, but they hit three."
The Vikings scored on their first three drives of the first half, going 80 and 85 yards on their first two marches. 
Johnson turned an apparent sack into a 51-yard gain, scrambling away from pressure and cutting left for the big run that set up his own 9-yard touchdown run. 
Johnson completed three passes on the Vikings' longest drive, hitting Ziquarius Webber and Kevin Jefferson on the march that finished when Johnson dropped a third-down pass across the middle. Senior tight end Michael Miner made a catch facing his quarterback and backed into the end zone.
The third drive didn't need as much real estate. McNeil punter Neil Janosek fumbled a low snap and was tackled at the 15. Bryan scored on fourth down when Jefferson took a short pitch on the left sideline and got a key block from Alan Weedon to complete a 7-yard scoring play on fourth and two.
McNeil appeared set to cut into Bryan's 21-0 lead in the second quarter. Harrell was stripped of the ball as he ran toward the end zone and Alex Pappas recovered for a touchback.

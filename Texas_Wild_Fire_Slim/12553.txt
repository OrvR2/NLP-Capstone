AUSTIN  Firefighting crews started Wednesday to gain control of a wind-stoked blaze that has raged unchecked across parched Central Texas for days, leaving a trail of charred properties in its wake and causing thousands of people to flee.

At least two people have died in the wildfire, which has destroyed more than 600 homes and blackened about 45 square miles in and around Bastrop, a city about 25 miles from Austin.
Texas Forest Service spokeswoman April Saginor said the Bastrop fire was 30 percent contained early Wednesday, and that the lighter winds were assisting firefighters in their efforts.

The blaze in Bastrop is the most catastrophic of the more than 180 fires that have erupted in the past week across Texas, marking the worst fire season in state history.
About 1,000 homes have been lost since November in fires that have burned 3.6 million acres. 
Nichelle Bielinski and her husband, John, walked through the devastation of their home Tuesday after a wildfire blazed through their Steiner Ranch neighborhood.
"It looks like a bomb dropped on it," said Nichelle, 44, a music teacher. 
Reduced winds of 5 to 10 mph could last through Saturday, allowing firefighters to get close to the fire and dig fire lines with bulldozers and by hand, said Mike Ferris, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service near Bastrop, where the fires killed two people, bringing the overall death toll to four. The fires have destroyed about 600 homes since Sunday.
Record heat and drought have led to fires spanning the Lone Star State. Seventeen major cities  recorded their hottest summer this year, beating records that go back more than 100 years, said  historian Christopher Burt of the Weather Underground. More than 81% of the state is in exceptional drought conditions, the worst level, according to the government's U.S. Drought Monitor. 
The 30,000-acre Bastrop Complex Fire began Sunday, driven by 35-mph winds of Tropical Storm Lee. It burned nearly  600 homes, a state record for a single fire. An additional 250 or so homes burned elsewhere in Texas since the weekend began, Huffman said. An additional 200 may have been destroyed in smaller fires, she said. The previous record for a single fire was 160 homes  near Dallas-Fort Worth in April.
Texas Forest Service officials were preparing  to hand over coordination of the fire effort to a federal team run by the U.S. Forest Service, Ferris said.
Gov. Rick Perry, who cut short a presidential campaign trip, toured a blackened area near Bastrop on Tuesday. Perry said he expects federal assistance but that red tape was keeping bulldozers and other equipment at the Army's Fort Hood, 75 miles from Bastrop. Fort Hood was battling its own 3,700-acre fire.
 "When you've got lives that are in danger in particular, I really don't care who the asset belongs to. If it's sitting in some yard somewhere and not helping be part of the solution, that's a problem," he said.
"The orders we've put in are being filled," Ferris said. "Both equipment and personnel. If they're not here now, they're in route."
Bastrop Mayor Terry Orr said about 25 homes were destroyed inside the city limits, and wildlands nearby are "a scene of devastation."
"It is a moonscape,"  Orr said. The hilly landscape was covered in burned pines and cedars, and parts of houses were still standing, "but everything is basically gray," he said. "It is a terrible sight."
Some stunned residents returned Tuesday to their scorched neighborhoods. Fay Billingsley, 42, said burned houses  stood next to some untouched by  flames. Row after row of homes were blackened. Furniture had melted into twisted mounds. "It's like doomsday," she  said.
In Austin, the Bielinskis surveyed the damage to the house they had fled Sunday with daughter Alexis, a first-grader, and Nichelle's mother, Estella Butler, 68. The family lost an antique grand piano and keepsakes such as a  limited-edition Great Books series that Butler  was saving for her granddaughter. 
Their cul-de-sac was among the hardest-hit in the Steiner Ranch subdivision, where the fire claimed 23 homes.
"We are so lucky," Nichelle Bielinski said. "We are so blessed. We got out with our family."

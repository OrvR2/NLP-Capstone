"Happy Feet" Is heading home, and you can follow him.
The wayward emperor penguin who washed up on a New Zealand beach in late June began his journey back to Antarctica last Monday as a research vessel dropped him off closer to his Southern home. Since then, he's been slowly snaking his way home, despite first turning North. 
The penguin gained the name from his similarity to a situation in the animated film "Happy Feet."
The Associated Press reports that the penguin was moved to a zoo after he confused sand for snow and became sick. Karen Fifield, Wellington Zoo's chief executive said, "He's brought a lot of hope and joy to people ... His story has driven to the heart of what makes us human."
Just because this little guy is free to roam now doesn't mean that it's the last we'll ever hear of him. Just like in the movie, he's been fit with a tracking device that lets people watch his movements online.
You can access the tracker by clicking here, or on the Sirtrack image below. Scroll down for video footage of Happy Feet's release.

				I have to admit to chuckling out loud when they gave a little nudge down the ramp and into the water. (I just imagined him thinking, "Hey, what the hell?") It reminded me of that video that made the rounds a while back where a penguin sticks out his flipper to trip another penguin, causing him to fall into the water....

Good luck to the little guy.

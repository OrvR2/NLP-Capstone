Central Texas Wildfire Relief









Wildfires sweeping across Central Texas have destroyed more than 1,000 homes in the last several days. Nearly 200 fires have broken out across Texas in the past week, claiming multiple lives and consuming thousands of acres of landscape. The Bastrop fire has claimed 785 homes, the most houses ever destroyed by a single fire in Texas history. It also forced the evacuation of about 5,000 people in the rural community. More than 360 firefighters and 47 fire engines have been deployed to fight the blaze. Wildfires also tore through other parts of Central Texas, including Leander and Spicewood, burning hundreds of acres.
In this time of crisis, it is important that we come together and do our part to help out our neighbors. There are several relief benefits going on throughout the city of Austin, and we have compiled a list of Central Texas Wildfire Relief events that you can participate in and/or contribute to. Every little bit helps. Do you know of a wildfire relief event in Austin that we don't have listed? Please shoot us a message to let us know about it. You can do much more to assist by checking out the various relief options listed at KVUE and on the Austin Chronicle blog.Also,
 the Williamson County Regional Animal Shelter is collecting food and 
other pet supplies for Bastrop fire evacuees who own pets. You can drop 
off food, cat litter, crates, and toys at Regional Shelter, 1855 S.E. 
Inner Loop in Georgetown, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. today and from 8 a.m. to
 2 p.m. on Thursday. You can leave supplies at the door after hours.

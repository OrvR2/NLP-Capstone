Coach’s disagreement with ref leads to team walk off, forfeit By      Cameron Smith


There are plenty of strange circumstances under which a team can forfeit a game. Still, none may be more bizarre than the ones under which the Seattle (Wash.) Garfield team walked off the field from their first game of the 2011 season, when the Bulldogs forfeited their season opener after their coach disagreed with a single call by the game's officials.
According to KING 5 TV in Seattle, the coach who ordered his team off the field has now been placed on administrative leave after just one game on the job, all because he refused to let his team play out the rest of the game after he was infuriated by what he considered to be a blown call.
As covered by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and KING 5 -- and documented in the user-submitted video to KING 5 below -- Garfield was trailing Lake Washington (Wash.) High, 14-0, in the third quarter of the season opener for both teams. That's when Garfield coughed up the ball on a running play and Lake Washington recovered.

Or, at least the referees on the field ruled that Lake Washington recovered. Garfield coach Kelvin Goliday didn't like the call, and immediately pulled his players from the field, calling a timeout to try and discuss the play with officials. The officials refused to discuss the play with Goliday, saying that their ruling on a prior play was final. After two minutes, Garfield's team was supposed to return to the field, but it didn't. When the team still wouldn't come back out for the snap after the play clock wound all the way down, Goliday was hit with a delay of game penalty.
Moments later, he was assessed a second delay of game penalty, which automatically ejected him from the game.
With their coach gone, the Bulldogs still refused to come out on to the field, leaving officials no choice but to award the game to Lake Washington as a 14-0 forfeit.
"I've never seen that before ever," Lake Washington athletic director George Crowder told KING 5.
On Monday, Goliday spoke about the incident for the first time with the Seattle Times, citing safety concerns for pulling his team off the field. In particular, on the fumble play that precipitated the bizarre forfeit, Goliday felt that officials should have stopped action long before the ball was stripped.
"The timeout to call him over for a safety issue, I would have done anyway," Goliday told the Times. "It was just the timing of it. I really think that would have changed the entire night. Being down 14-0, you haven't lost the game. It's early third quarter. You're still in the game. But what do I do? What do I do when I feel like I need to be heard at that time?"

For his part, Crowder felt that the game had been officiated in a completely normal fashion for an early season contest.
"I'm not sure what the issues were on his side. All I can go with is my observation. It was a very typical first football game," Crowder told the Times. "My observation, there was nothing that would indicate that kids were in any more danger than they are in any typical high school game."
While Garfield's decision to forfeit a game by pulling all its players off the field is not the first time a coach has made that drastic decision, it might be the first time such a voluntary forfeit followed such a trivial dispute. After all, it's not like Garfield was out of the game; the Kangs only had a two-possession lead with more than a quarter remaining in the game.
The remainder of the game will never be played, and fans who were in attendance at the game continue to express their astonishment at what unfolded before them in the third quarter.
"He just taught them if they don't like what's going on, just give up and quit," Lake Washington fan Nic Tomei told KING 5.

0 users disliked this comment CHRISTOPHER 3 minutes ago Report Abuse The bottom line is. As a coach myself player safety is at the top of the list, along with fare play and respecting your opponent. The coach above all is an educator.   What has this coach taught his young people?   What I took from the coaches comments was - "I wanted to be heard, but the officials would not get into a debate with me, so I had my team quit". Great lesson coach - "if I don't get my way I will not play". As for if the play was over or not before the fumble occurred. We cannot know for sure unless we see the actual play.   As I noted in an earlier response to a comment made - If the player with the ball continues to fight for extra yardage the play is not over. The play is only over when forward progress is stopped. One more thing for all you people who are ripping on the refs - get out there and do yourself if you think you can do better. The human element is what makes officiating so tough. What one person perceives as being true more than likely is not what someone else perceives as being true.   

The true measure of greatness is not what we accomplish on a clear path, but what we accomplish when that path has obstacles.

2 users disliked this comment Florian 6 minutes ago Report Abuse The team did the right thing. When you are stuck with incompetent refs, it's time to go. It's the refs that should be fired and have their cards pulled so they won't be able to ref again. The coach should have left and taken his team with him.They did the right thing!

1 users disliked this comment John E 6 minutes ago Report Abuse At the end of the article, some m@r@n stated that "the coach did nothing but teach his team how to quit".   Excuse me m@r@n, but the coach, even if he was wrong, taught his team to take a stand for what they feel is right.   The coach did not teach his team to quit.

0 users disliked this comment Mr. P 7 minutes ago Report Abuse Man, boo for that coach!! If he and the team didn't like how the refs were calling the game, they should've stuck it out and fought on to try to win the game, just like my high school football team did when we were in a similar situation.

We were the visiting team playing against another school, but the refs were calling everything against us: holding, false start, unsportsmans like conduct. THEY EVEN FLAGGED US BECAUSE OUR CLEATS WERE TOO BIG!!! (I'm not lying; they actually made that call. Our cleats were normal size, but to appease the refs, we had to be scraping them against the concrete to shave them down.)

Meanwhile, the home team were getting away with murder. The boiling point was when they totally face-masked the living crap out of our quaterback. He was running away from the blitz, by how they grabbed, his body was going one way, his head was going another way. It was blatant as can be, but still nothing from the refs. When our coach complained to the ref about the lack of a call, they kicked him out of the game.

This was our predicament: the lead that we had was gone, the refs biased against us, and now we'd lost a coach. Unlike this coach and team from this article, we didn't give up. INSTEAD, WE GOT PISSED!!! Our mindsets were : "YOU KNOW WHAT?!! THE HECK WITH THIS!! LET'S BEAT THESE GUYS AND GET OUTTA HERE!!!" And that's what we did. I think the final score was 42-8.

After the game, our coach talked to us. He said that he was proud of us, because despite the situation, we stepped up. Then he mentioned how when losing teams complain of bad referees, nobody listens, but it's a different picture when a WINNING team complain about a bad ref.

I don't like talking much, | - ) but the icing to the cake was when I got the newspaper article about that game (which I still have). The headline said as follows: DESPITE LOSING COACH, HILL DOES NOT LOSE COOL (Andrew Hill was my high school).

Glad this guy wasn't in charge of our troops..he should be fired and maybe even the guy who hired him in the first place

9 users disliked this comment Yukon Jack 15 minutes ago Report Abuse Maybe if the ref. would have discussed the call with the coach when the coach asked, the incident could have been avoided. Some of the H.S refs out there act like they are getting paid 100,000 grand instead of the 75-100 bucks per game.Lighten up refs.

7 users disliked this comment Joe Bob 15 minutes ago Report Abuse I played high school football, and if my coach did that I wouldn't play anymore. If he was fired I'd maybe come back but the first thing I'd do is tell the coach to go F#%K himself, we're playing. I mean, he was thrown out of the game so therefore was not allowed to continue to run the team, so the team should have not listened and an assistant coach should've stepped up and said "no, we're playing". I'm glad he got fired, but one game can make the difference for a high school team. Hopefully they can bounce back and still compete.

9 users disliked this comment Less Gov't 19 minutes ago Report Abuse This is typical Seattle behavior.   A bunch of whiny leftists who pout and act passive-aggressive when they don't get their way.   the coach set a horrible example and the players must be wondering what's going on.   I hope they feel like a bunch of sissies for forfeiting.   But the coach is clearly to blame.   a wussy emotional decision.

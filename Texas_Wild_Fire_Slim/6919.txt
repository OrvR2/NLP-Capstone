GALVESTON, TX -- 
On the third anniversary of Hurricane Ike's destructive landfall here, four lead social service organizations will release a report on how about $35 million awarded as a federal social service block grant was spent on the community's recovery.

The groups plan to seek additional federal funding to meet the demand for mental health and other social services. The original grant money was spent on a variety of things from counseling to medication for people who lost nearly everything in the storm. Dozens of smaller organizations benefited from the grant. Ike struck Galveston as a strong Category 2 hurricane early on Sept. 13, 2008.

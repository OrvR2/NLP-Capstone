On Religion: For One Boy, Bar Mitzvah Lessons Bridge a Chasm of Cultures

			September 10, 2011 · Posted in USA  
		

Sam was practicing for his bar mitzvah on Oct. 15, a protocol that elevates him to Jewish manhood. Over a duration of 3 months, it has been and will be Dave Hall’s pursuit to sight him to pronounce with a best probable cadence, projection and pronunciation. Just now, Mr. Hall sat on a piano dais following a content and reminding Sam, not for a initial time or a last, to delayed down.        

Mr. Hall was operative with Sam Botwin in partial because, as a musician and composer, he had grown a sideline over a years of assisting Jewish children intone a Torah apportionment and haftara thoroughfare for their bar and bat mitzvah ceremonies. He was operative with Sam since he was a crony of his relatives and had educated Sam’s younger brother, Sasha, on a piano for several years.        

One building underneath a operation room, a family sketch complacent atop a living-room piano. It showed a prime male with a same black hair and olive skin of Mr. Hall. The male was his grandfather and newcomer ancestor, Yusef Lahoud, an Arab Christian from Lebanon.        

Ten years after a Al Qaeda attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, amid a meridian of guess of Arab and Muslim Americans, a partnership between Mr. Hall and Sam Botwin serves as a gleaming, redemptive instance — an anomaly, to be sure, though one that shows that racial and eremite chasms can be breached.        

“I privately exclude to be a Other to anyone else, and we exclude to see anyone else as a Other,” Mr. Hall, 50, pronounced after a new session. “We’re all in a same path. As unapproachable as we am of my heritage, we never wish us to consider of ourselves as so opposite that we can’t all conclude a annuity and virtue of a earth.”        

Peter H. Schweitzer, Sam’s rabbi during a City Congregation for Humanistic Judaism, has remarkable a routine with sold satisfaction. Several weeks before Sam’s ceremony, in fact, a assemblage will symbol a bat mitzvah of a lady with a Jewish mom and Muslim father.        

“There’s so many malice and distrust and stress out there, and I’m certain it goes in both directions,” Rabbi Schweitzer pronounced of a inhabitant mood. “Fanatical voices tend to get listened a most, and they crush or overpower those that are looking for a approach to come together. But assent work is finished during a micro level, one to one. When a child like Sam can accommodate a male like Dave, it goes a prolonged way.”        

For many of his life, Mr. Hall had not identified so deeply with a Arab side of his ancestry. Growing adult in vanilla Vermont, carrying a surname and origin of English forebears who reached America in 1630, he put no special appetite into possibly affirming or denying his maternal roots. Only once during college in Burlington did dual connoisseur students from Kuwait ask, “Are we Lebanese?”        

Moving to New York as a immature musician, oddity began to excommunicate indifference. Mr. Hall picked adult Arabic operative in a Middle Eastern grill in Greenwich Village. He sought out a Lebanese Maronite church in Brooklyn Heights. He trafficked several times to a Levant.        

Meanwhile, he built a freelancer’s life — essay song for low-pitched shows and children’s theater, building a choir in a public-housing project, training voice in an after-school module during a private propagandize in Park Slope. In a late 1990s, dual of a girls he educated there became his initial bat mitzvah students.        

While Mr. Hall knew no Hebrew, he straightforwardly grasped a similarities between a liturgical song of a synagogue and of Arab Christian churches, many of that use a cantor as a vestige of Jewish tradition. In a Torah and haftara portions, he could hear a low-pitched foundations of a Gregorian chants he knew from a part-time pursuit with a Roman Catholic assemblage in Westchester.

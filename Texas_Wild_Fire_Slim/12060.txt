	        			        			          		Former FGDC Executive Director on Mapping and the Spatial Data Infrastructure
		          			          	
						        



“Cartographers, imagery analysts, geographic information system GIS specialists and others who work with maps and geospatial information operate on the premise that location or place is the most effective organizing principal for bringing together information and making it understandable for use. Others outside of the geospatial community are also increasingly recognizing that “where” is the most common integrating element of almost all data and information.

Why do I see a streaming video prior to the video clip I selected?  Sometimes, a streaming media advertisement will play before the video.  [Back to top] 5. Can I skip this streaming media advertisement? No, you cannot skip the streaming advertisement. [Back to top] 6. The video displays like a slide show. How can I fix this?  The videos that you are watching are sent, or streamed, to your computer over the Internet. The speed at which these files can be streamed varies depending on your computer's "bandwidth". In other words, if you have a high bandwidth connection (i.e. cable, DSL, T1/LAN connection), your computer can receive streaming video at a higher speed than a user with low bandwidth (i.e. modem / ISDN) connection. This also means that a user with high bandwidth can receive larger, better quality video stream. On the other hand, a user with a lower bandwidth may receive the video as a slide show or choppy if they cannot receive the full video stream. You can also check your video card settings. Set the number of colors higher than 256k colors.  Finally, you may be experiencing problems due to bandwidth congestion. If the problem persists, we also recommend checking back at a time when your Internet service provider may experience less congestion to see if there is an improvement. [Back to top] 7. Windows Media Player displays but nothing happens?  Verify that you meet the system requirements for Windows Media Player as outlined above. [Back to top] 8. I cannot hear the audio. How can I fix this? To be able to hear the audio on videos, you must have a working sound card and your computer speakers turned on with the volume set at an appropriate level. If you still receive video without audio, verify that your system audio works by playing another audio application and/or checking your speaker and headphone wires. [Back to top] 9. The audio sounds like chipmunks - too fast. How can I fix this? Updating your sound card's driver might take care of this problem. If you need assistance with getting the latest version of your sound card driver, contact the card manufacturer. [Back to top] 10. What speed does the video play at? The videos that you are watching are sent, or streamed, to your computer over the Internet. The speed at which these files can be streamed varies depending on your computer's "bandwidth". In other words, if you have a high bandwidth connection (i.e. cable, DSL, T1/LAN connection), your computer can receive streaming video at a higher speed than a user with low bandwidth (i.e. modem / ISDN) connection.  The video on this site is streamed at 4 different rates to allow for the best quality for your bandwidth. [Back to top]

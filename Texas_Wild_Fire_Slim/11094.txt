About a month ago, HuffPost Food, along with many food bloggers, received an email from the PR agency Ketchum. Our invitation read:
We would like to invite you to an exclusive underground restaurant, Sotto Terra, with George Duran and Phil Lempert in New York City – only open from August 23-27, 2011.
 
Please see the attached invitation for details – we hope you join us!

We did not attend, but several New York-based food bloggers did, and some offered giveaways on their blogs for readers to attend as well. Though some knew there would be a catch -- there's no such thing as a free meal, after all -- diners remained optimistic about the meal.
None of them were expecting a four-course meal of frozen box meals from ConAgra-owned brand Marie Callender's, with cameras filming diners' reactions. What seems like a ploy similar to Pizza Hut's hidden camera pasta commercials may have backfired though. Many of the attendees have written blog posts summarizing the event, saying they felt irked and hoodwinked. Several have pointed out the irony that conversations before the meal with George Duran and Phil Lempert discussed eating better and healthier...but then what they ate was the opposite.
Stephanie Moritz, senior director of public relations and social media at ConAgra told the New York Times that ConAgra hoped to use the footage for videos on YouTube on on its website, and for bloggers to generate buzz about being "pleasantly surprised" about what they ate.
Instead, they were greeted with the following blogger reactions:
Chubby Chinese Girl: "They were too confident about their products or just didn't believe in our palates and tastebuds. To make it even worse, a "giveway" that sounded like lavish dinner for my readers wasn't a classy move either. If I accept an invite and it turns out bad, that's fine, it was mine time, I can live with that. But having me promote it and then give my readers/winners frozen food isn't called for."
Mom Confessionals: "Our entire meal was a SHAM!  We were unwilling participants in a bait-and-switch for Marie Callender’s new frozen three cheese lasagna and there were cameras watching our reactions. I’ve got a sense of humor so I was okay with it and I had been enjoying myself up until that point, but I could tell that the rest of the participants were not. Everyone feigned weak shock and faked approval of the frozen meal. My guests were eager to leave all of a sudden and refused to sign the release."  
 Food Mayhem: "I told you first hand of our focus on wholesome food, particularly with our baby in tow.  We both said to you, with 20+ witnesses and apparently hidden cameras, how much we despise over-processed foods and artificial ingredients.  We discussed with the group the sad state of chemical-filled foods and discussed various chains.  And yet, you still fed me the exact thing I said I did not want to eat." 
The blog Brand Noise wrote that the event "broke every basic social media and research rule." 
Moritz told the Times, “It was never our intention to put any bloggers or their guests in an uncomfortable position and for that we are sorry.” ConAgra has offered to reimburse attendees for expenses such as cab fare and babysitting.

				Everyone has missed the real story here....  What was their reaction to the food BEFORE being told it was frozen??  These are all comments from their blogs, not from the event itself.  My guess is that they were pleased with the food or at least not disgusted with it.  All the reporting on this is incredibly misleading as it leads people to assume that they A. hated the food and B. expressed this outrage at the event.

				They were shocked to discover they were served frozen preservati­ves and chemicals under the guise of eating better.

Lesson learned. From now on when people talk about eating better, we need to ask, "better than what?"

				I can’t believe some of the comments I’m seeing about this unethical PR stunt. People are not reading the posting from the outraged bloggers that attended this event. The other 38+% that were thoroughly displeased said that they knew something was off with the entree and dessert. The lasagna was mostly described as salty, mushy, and with “weird, almost too uniform meat pieces to be homemade.” The dessert was deemed too sweet and the crumb topping had an odd texture. Most of these bloggers didn’t even finish their entrees and picked at the dessert. Like most civilized, polite, educated people, they didn’t immediatel­y bash the food, but they found it odd that they didn’t have any real chance to talk about it at the table. Seems Lembert swiftly kept the conversati­on moving away from talk about the food being served. They were not expecting a high profile chef to serve them frozen food! They were there to eat Duran’s food, not be duped into believing otherwise by ConAgra’s PR firm. In my younger years I ate a fair amount of frozen food cause I just didn’t know any better as a young twenty-som­ething going through college. I can always tell the difference between frozen, prepared food and fresh, homemade food...sim­ply because I’ve eaten a lot of both. Lesson learned for ConAgra! If you want approval for the processed, frozen nonsense you call food, don’t invite a bunch of foodie bloggers to taste it!

				What I find strange about this is that people would go somewhere just for a free meal.  They had to know there was a catch.  What is that corny old phrase,  "There is no such thing as a free lunch" - or something like that.
My husband worked for ConAgra at one time - it was a company that ConAgra bought.  It did not take him long to realize he could not stay there.

				This trick worked for Pizza Hut because they invited regular folks, not people who pay attention to food for a living. Plus, Pizza Hut puts all their hot dishes through an real oven to cook. They aren't nuked nor designed to sit in a freezer for months on end. It was pure stupidity by ConAgra's PR to think they could pull this off.

				Those bloggers need to get on the Soylent Green bandwagon.  Eating foods rich in human tissue helps our bodies absorb the nutrients we need in order to fight back against Corporatis­m.  I understand your concern about eating meat that is fed a GMO diet, but their patented process removes all traces of that in the grinding and combining process.   Would you refuse a meal by your Aunt Marie?

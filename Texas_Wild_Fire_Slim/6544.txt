Add your fic to our update tweets!

You've seen the tweets, right?  We're telling the whole fandom when our favorite fics are updated!  Want to make sure your fic is on the list?






First...Some Guidelines
We don't have a lot of rules when it comes to our Fic Update Tweets, but the ones we do have are pretty important to making sure our staff can manage the extra work and our tweets are something our followers want to check out.  

In the past, a lot of people have simply skipped past these guidelines and signed up, leaving us in the awkward position of having to say, "Hey, ummm...sorry, but..." So we're changing things up a bit.  

Please read ahead and make sure you agree to the following before submitting your information.

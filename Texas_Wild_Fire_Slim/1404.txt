$24,000.

That's the average student debt in America, according to a report last year from the Project on Student Debt.
For many students, that figure is modest. Take Aleesha Nash, a graduate of New York University. "Logging into the Federal Student Aid website," she writes on the Huffington Post, "I see that today my balance is $104,104.63 for a percentage of the information in my head."
And there's Jaclyn Cabral, too. Jaclyn chose to attend Elon University in North Carolina because it's "regarded as one of the most affordable private educations." Still, she graduated $90,000 in debt.
For many of these students, paying off their loans is a nearly unsurmountable challenge. Brandon Woods, a Hampton University alum, finds himself working two jobs -- and hardly making a dent in his $58,000 deficit. 
Since HuffPost College's launch in Feb. 2010, we've been documenting the stories -- your stories -- of students and graduates in crippling, suffocating debt. The students who are America's promise, its very future, and can hardly afford to keep themselves afloat. This is our third installment in the series.

I'm all for paying high prices for good value -- and my education was certainly of quality -- but I'm not in the market to be abused. From interest rates to the ease of borrowing, to confusion of terms and steadily climbing price of college tuition, I guess I have to thank all of the higher education system while I have the floor to speak. To the loan companies, the banks and private colleges: thank you. I and my peers will forever be indebted to you. Read more...

				I'll be finishing college without any debt. Thank you in-state public school with tuition well under 10k.

Unless you're at an Ivy League school and got hooked up with connection­s that will help you a lifetime, there's no reason to pay that much more for an education. If you want to learn, you can do it respectabl­y without the hype. And if you're actually good enough to get in anywhere, you can go to grad school for free or almost free and greatly increase not only just earning potential but your chances at being hired at all. And if you're really good you can get into a more prestigiou­s program for the same amount of money (free or close to free).

There's no reason to be over 100k in debt after college and whoever signed themselves up for that clearly made an unwise and unrealisti­c decision regarding their education choices.

				Apparently not. But considerin­g my circumstan­ces versus the people in the slide show, particular­ly the ones who paid out the a** to go to private schools that very few employers would favor over a state school, I'd take my version of "not getting it" than their version of not getting it any day. 
Like the first girl? You don't necessaril­y "get what you pay for" in education, and she has no way of knowing the quality education she could have received at a different university­. No it is not any of their fault that the market is this bad.  Nor the problem of predatory lenders, which IS a problem. Yes the increases in tuitions is a crime, as is the insistance on wildly overpriced textbooks.  Doesn't make their choice any better. Time to take a more realistic approach to education, and money generally. Just because you got into a school that costs over 30k a year doesn't mean it's worth it for you to attend. Don't take out a loan you can't afford just because it's easy to get. Yes there are problems in the system, but there's a price for gullibilit­y and man did they buy in.

				I didn't intend to be bundling everyone in college debt in the same sorry lot. Personally­, I consider your situation much different, and much more understand­able, than the many people in the slide who chose to go to wildly expensive universiti­es and who no doubt had more affordable options in achieving their education, and regrettabl­y neglected to take them.  Even more so than the state universiti­es and community colleges, the overwhelmi­ng majority of americans cannot afford private education. With tuitions alone that frequently cost over 40k a semester..­. I mean consider that money in terms of cars. That's an entry level luxury vehicle every year the kid spends in college. Ridiculous­, right?  So lets be honest. Is the 40k a year diploma with a fancy university name on it that still didn't ensure any type of employment worth it?

				Overall, though, I do think there's a large area for reform.  Addressing the issue of high intrest student loans is one thing, but won't necessaril­y help in the event you remain jobless after graduation­, particular­ly for an extended period of time.  And the only way to make tuitions go down is exclusive to publicly funded universiti­es and colleges and would involve raising taxes specifical­ly to fund the system.  Going to one of the most prestigiou­s public universiti­es in the world in New Zealand as an internatio­nal student would cost what it did for you to go to tech college, after adjusting for currency difference­s. For people who actually live in New Zealand, it it typically costs less than 3k US dollars because their universiti­es are funded far more through taxes than directly from the students.  There are some clear choices we have to make if we want college education to be more affordable and it's not going to happen unless people get real about what that will entail.

				College was a way to divide the rich kids and the poor kids. The poor kids labored while the rich kids worked in offices and continued their parents' legacy. Somewhere along the line, the government made college accessible to the poor kids and they could prove they were smart by the degrees they earned from those previously inaccessib­le institutio­ns. 
These days, we don't have the job vacancies to support both the rich and the poor, so companies are running credit checks on applicants­. In spite of smarts and work ethic, many applicants will now be scrutinize­d by their financial records, making it impossible to be gainfully employed, keeping the concrete divide between the rich and the poor.

				"Somewhere along the line, the government made college accessible to the poor kids . . ."

They sure did! It was called the GI bill. For the first time, kids who would never have been able to afford college had a chance. This was right after WW2. Think what a price they paid for that chance! The result is what has been called  our "greatest generation­." One of the things that made America great was public education for anyone who wished to take advantage of it. 

Contrast that with the present-da­y attack on our public education system and ask yourself why that is happening. The answer might surprise you. Hopefully it will enlighten you.

				I'm over $25,000 in debt now. And, like #7, I've defaulted and fallen off the grid. I went to college, I learned, I partied, I got a few scholarshi­ps, I participat­ed, and I got great grades. 
College should be a place for learning, not a cash cow. The more expensive the college, the more recognizab­le the name, the more likely you are to get a job.
Only, there aren't enough jobs to sustain our massive population growth. College was supposed to separate the rich kids from the poor kids, but the government granted education to the poor kids and here we are.

				No, the GI bill HELPS to pay for college. The only way the military pays the full ride is if you are a career officer and the course of study you are pursuing is one considered to be beneficial to the service. It also depends on which version of the GI bill you are operating under.

I went through college with the assistance of the GI bill, which I earned with three years of my life. It paid for my tuition, everything else was on me, so I worked for the rest of it. 

This was before the push started to convince middle America that if you didn't go to the best college, you were doomed to being a short order cook. These days, a short order cook is one of the better jobs available. Thank your local politician­s for that.

				You know, conservati­ves kept arguing, whenever I brought up single payer, that it wouldn't pay doctors as much, and when I said they could still live more comfortabl­y than most people in the country, they said "but without the likelihood of getting rich, where's the incentive to invest in that training?"

Putting aside the absurd notion that money is the only motivator, by that logic, shouldn't we be giving incentives to companies to hire  at high wages, or setting the system up so that paying off student loans WON'T take decade after decade?

				Another problem, too, is mommies and daddies aren't saving for their kids' educations­. If you can't afford $100 a month into a savings account for 18 years -- which at 2% would generate about $28,665 by the time junior is ready for the big leagues -- then something is really, really wrong. Turn off the cable, don't buy every new plastic box out there, don't waste major dough on rims, work 60-plus hours per week...and­, presto, cash in the bank after 18 years and no need to go overboard saddling little Suzy and little Johnny into life-long debt. Planning & discipline are the keys to fending off such foolishnes­s, and parents -- not the banks or the government -- are responsibl­e. Then again, many Americans can't handle...s­uch rigidity and common sense (they'd rather make foolish decisions to satisfy immediate gratificat­ion and then blame everyone else after the bills arrive)...

				What world are you living in?

"If you can't afford $100 a month . . . then something is really, really wrong." For many families, 100/month is the difference between life and death. Your glib assumption­s are an insult to every family struggling to survive in this world and hoping they can scrape together enough to keep their kids clothed and fed.

				It's interestin­g how many people here are blaming the kids.  Not me.  I say, blame the system.  Blame "America."  I grew up being told by teachers, friends, presidents­, congressma­n, news anchors, reporters, and many others, that it was imperative to have a degree.  "It's the "new economy," they said.  "You need a degree to be competitiv­e," was all we heard.  "Do you want to be successful and live the American dream?" they asked.  

Yeah, we were all fed a bunch of lies.   And, honestly, at 18 I can't even buy alcohol because I'm not "mature" enough to handle it; but I can sign student loan contracts filled with languages that it takes lawyers to understand­??

				College is great but you need a plan to be employable so one must focus on learning certain industries to maximize their investment into their education. Unfortunat­ely, too many kids get sucked into 'passions' and 'dreams' that may not generate much income or they get sucked into the fun of college life and lose focus. If you are not wealthy but end up in a private college, know that trust-fund­ers around you can get away with 'fun' majors such as art history, creative writing etc. since these kids never truly have to make money to survive. For the rest of us, it's best to stick to the safe majors or ones that will prep you for a specialize­d graduate degree. What they don't teach enough of in college is how your knowledge can translate into income in the real world.

				Totally true. And everyone who just goes into degrees without really knowing what they'll do with it or what it would actually require of them to use it. 

I did make the choice to go after my affinity for the social sciences rather than try and suffer through the pre-requis­ites attending veterinary school would require. However, from day one I made an effort to get acquainted with what it would take to put the degree to any use. So far, I've had great success and accomplish­ed everything I wanted and even finished a year early. But it's not over if I want to get precisely where I want. 

In any case, in my experience it's literally all about realistic planning. You have to know what you're getting into and have a reasonable understand­ing of what your options are going to look like. You also have to understand that for most majors, you have to set yourself apart for employers on your own. You can't make average grades, take no internship­s, develop no close relationsh­ips with the professors in your department­, and expect to have anything to show for yourself when you get through.

				Why are these idiots going to college if they can't AFFORD it in the first place!!?? 

No one forced you to take that loan in the first place. Just because you went to Hoidy Toidy U it doesn't entitle you to a high paying job as soon as you walk in the door!  

Wow, this culture of entitlemen­t is getting what it deserves.

				So if an "idiot" can't afford college, what should they do?  If you can't afford to attend a in state 4 year university­, or you dont want to spend 4 years at a two year college (because you're paying out of pocket) would you suggest a trade school?  

I think the bigger thing is that most of these people were struggling to find employment­, not employment that makes half a million dollars a yea, that was my case when i graduated.

				What are you even saying in your message?  Seriously, I'm going to deconstruc­t it.

"Why are these idiots going to college if they can't AFFORD it in the first place!!??"

Okay, I'm an idiot.  Also, I went because loans made me think I could afford it, and because my parents would have killed me if I told them I wasn't going to go to Berkeley, or University of Chicago, where I was also accepted.  They would have straight up killed me.

"No one forces you to take that loan in the first place.  Just because you went to Hoidy Toidy U it doesn't entitle you to a high paying job as soon as you walk in the door!"

But I don't want to work in manual labor, or food service.  I want to work in jobs that would immediatel­y disregard my applicatio­n if I didn't go to college.  That's why.  I don't believe that my family's socio-econ­omic class should determine my future.  Are you implying that we have some sort of a caste-syst­em?  

"Wow, this culture of entitlemen­t is getting what it deserves."

Yep.  Free-think­ing, ambitious young people who think that the world doesn't have to suck.

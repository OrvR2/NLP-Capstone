Well now Dr. Oz is getting ready for a new season of health advice right here on Channel 4, and he showed us a behind the scenes look at his show in New York City.

Search online for "Get Samples 123" if you are looking for famous brands samples. It is the best and I always have success.

I spoke to my friend whom is following the story. His best friend has been a PA at this same hospital. Interesting enough there are details I'm learning that I think this video conveniently left out. Being a PA he was particularly interested on how this teen can do this. Well I'm told he went to HR and said he lost his ID and they made him a new one. The video says "fraudulently obtained". The video makes it sound like he falsified an ID. This further tells me that the ones to hang is the hospital for dropping the ball. They basically handed a PA title to a 17 year old. He got caught for asking for more access. From the video, is it me or does he not look 17? Some medications are based on age and yet no one at this hospital can take a plus or minus 3 guess as to how old he was? As Ernie says, yes he did something bad. I agree he did something pretty bad and stupid. First things first, get this hospital fixed. There is something not right there. Secondly, this teen should not be crumbled up and thrown away like a piece of bad society trash. I have personally worked with teens thought to be lost that are now great adults. I hope he gets a judge that will give him an alternative of 25 years or a curriculum to shape this kid into something positive.

So lets crucify the kid based on what ifs. What happened to HR and supposed hospital security whom are suppose to not allow unqualified personnel to do things? What if they let a rapist work on women? What if they put a homo to do prostate exams? What if they put a serial killer to save lives? Teens do stupid things. You would think a place like this would prevent this. What if we dug a little further in that hospital? Who else lied to get hired and did not get their background check done?

This has nothing to do with race at all. Why is it that every time something happens, someone links it to race? Its why we cant move forward into a different type of society. Just because he is white does not mean that he wont get many years in prison and just because you are white doesn't mean that you will get a job without a background check. I think these race comments are extremely offensive and derogatory. On the other hand, he impersonated a PA and performed medical actions in the environment of a hospital. If he had placed an IV wrong or performed CPR wrong, someone could have gotten seriously hurt or even died. That being said, because the worst didn't happen i think they should send him to get psychiatric help so that he can realize that this is wrong to do. Honestly i think they should just charge him as a minor and be done with it.

You're kidding, right Dad?  This kid has impersonated a cop and now a doctor and is in EXTRA LARGE trouble and you don't know if he needs psychiatric help?  Yes, he does.

This sounds like a mentally ill person. Be thankful he was found out. If not caught he could have done serious harm.

I would be interested in what they meant by "restricted areas". I find the article open ended. Was he trying to get into a room with an expensive "Cool Looking" MRI machine, or was he trying to get into a room with drugs.

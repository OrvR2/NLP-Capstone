NEW YORK (AP) — A shooting a few blocks off the route of the annual West Indian Day Parade on Monday night left a police officer wounded and a person dead.
The officer was hit in one of his arms and was hospitalized. He was expected to survive.
At least three other people also were shot. The fire department said a civilian died at the scene.
The gunshots rang out in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn after the parade, which was marred by fatal shootings in 2003 and 2005.
Revelers had filled the streets in colorful costumes. But gun violence shocked the festivities to a stop in spots. Police say four people were shot earlier and wounded along the parade route and a 15-year-old boy was grazed by a bullet nearby.
Violence has marred the parade for years, with fatal shootings along the route in 2003 and 2005. Police helicopters hovered overhead Monday, and officers on scooters and on foot patrolled the surrounding blocks.

The upcoming 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks plus a spate of holiday weekend violence have put the city "on heightened alert," police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said before the parade stepped off.
"We're doing a lot of things both seen and unseen," the commissioner said.
A City Council member was detained at the parade after getting into a confrontation with police.
Councilman Jumaane Williams, of Brooklyn, said he was put in handcuffs and was detained by officers after marching on the parkway. He called his detention "an easily avoidable incident involving a select number of police officers."
A spokesman for Williams said the councilman was taken into custody as he walked along a blocked-off sidewalk around 1:30 p.m. Monday. Spokesman Stefan Ringel said Williams had been given permission to walk along the street by a police official but was then stopped by other officers.
Williams was held for about 30 minutes before being released, Ringel said. No charges were filed, he said.
Bloodshed over the weekend included a Sunday shooting in the Bronx in which eight people, including children, were wounded. Four other people were shot, one fatally, in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn early Monday.
Kelly said some of the shootings were associated with the West Indian Day festivities.
"Frankly," he said, "this is something that does happen at this parade."
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the problem is "too many guns on the streets of this city."
He said New York has some of the toughest gun laws in the country, "but because it's so easy to buy guns in other states and just drive them in and sell them in the back of your car ... we've got to do something about it. This just can't go on."
Before the violence Monday, the parade thundered down a Brooklyn thoroughfare with its usual colorful, musical energy.
The annual Labor Day parade celebrates the culture of the Caribbean islands and is one of the city's largest outdoors events. Modeled on traditional Carnival festivities, it features dancers wearing enormous feathered costumes, music and plenty of food.
"This parade is fabulous!" said Arnold Caballero, who was manning a huge barbecue on a sidewalk. "There are people of all countries, and you meet friends you haven't seen for years."
The 52-year-old Trinidad native estimated that by day's end he would sell about 500 pounds of jerk and curry chicken, beef and pork from the stand he's run for a decade with two friends.
Caballero's friend Agnes Cherryl Phillips, a 55-year-old native of Grenada, added: "This is the most excellent parade you can ever have, with music and loved ones who come from all over America, from Miami to Canada."

				I dont see why the city wont shut the parade down already smh when they clearly see it ends in shootings and violence almost every year and you hardly ever hear about those things happening in other parades, if they dont know how to act like civilized people then they should not be allowed to have this kind of festivity happen . I wonder how many more shootings have to happen until the city/mayor grows balls big enough to close it down. Most people get tired of attending the same parade every year anyway after awhile it gets old , the mayor and the city is ignoring the ignorance and violence of this parade and by doing that they are allowing the violence to continue to happen bad enough violence happens just about every day in nyc , Im just glad I dont live near it but Its still annoying to have it in the borough so why dont they move it somewhere else,  they need to just put a end to it all together instead of talking about the violence everytime and not doing anything about it. This time a 15 year old boy was grazed and a police officer wounded next year it might be worse and maybe then they'll end it instead of just avoiding it now.

				Lets get some perspectiv­e here 47 shootings 3 million people that is  a crime rate of less than .02. per 1000 population­. Do you know how many states have a higher homicide rate ALL of them. And that .02 is not even a measure of homicide since all the shootings didnt result in death only a couple did. 

Perspectiv­e.

				They were 3 MILLION people there. It is the largest parade in the COUNTRY even the WORLD. Try having a 3 millioon people parade in Middle America and tell me that they are not going to be some shootings. The more people you have in a confined area the greater the chance of violence. Like I said that is lower homicide and violent crime rate than ALL the states. Look it up

Everyone in the city knows that the Bronx is more civilized than Brooklyn.
Never get caught at night in Brooklyn ( specially Crown Heights, Bed Sty and Flatbush ).

				End the damn parade, already. Several states have this kind of parade but on a smaller scale, I believe. It is too much of an inconvenie­nce for other people and the people involved act like the streets belong to them. End it now. It is a dangerous environmen­t with that amount of people who will have no place to run in an emergency.

				Sounds like a good idea...I really do not understand why NYC continues to approve this parade despite the violence.  As a matter of act, I know of no other state that has a "West Indian" Parade....  I read the article to gain an understand­ing...and I still do not understand why NYC  and the West Indians, persist with this parade, which seems to attract children, despite the viiolence it attracts.  This is very strange.

				I dont understand the meaning or reason for the parade either I think its a waste of tax dollars to have the streets closed and have police patrol a parade that almost always ends in violence. The puerto rican day parade should be different because puerto rico is property of the usa so I can see it having some what of a purpose and I dont hear about this kind of senseless violence at the other parades. I cant figure out why they insist on having this parade inspite the violence it brings every year and then people bring their kids out there and put them in harms way . It really doesnt make sense so I feel the same way you do .I dont know why they continue to have it when the violence continues, its obvious people cant go there without engaging in violence. I have been there before and it was really crowded but I didnt stay long enough to see the violence erupt but you can feel something will happen.  Like you said its strange that nyc allows this to continue.

				i am not defending this violence, however, just because you know of no other state that has a "West Indian Parade" says nothing. I can't think of any other state beside New York (or maybe Florida) that has such a large West Indian population­, hence the desire for a parade. Where there are large Irish population­s you will likely find an annual St. Patricks Day Parade laden with obnoxious alcoholics­...however­,  violence should not be tolerated from anyone...i­'m neither irish or west indian and personally i think these vain pride day parades are perhaps pathetic pastimes for the poor and ignorant,u­ncivilized and unamerican­.

				No don't end it, just do something about the illegal guns out there and maybe extend the route or move it somewhere else since it's become so largely attended.  There are a lot of people in NYC who are Caribbean/­of Caribbean descent who live here, work here, serve here.  It's NY's Carnival.  Many here in NYC look forward to the parade each year and the cultures represente­d.  They definitely however need to do something about the the crowd.  More and more people attend each year and the sidewalks of Eastern Parkway are just not wide enough to accommodat­e them all.

Fact:  The parade is not a dangerous environmen­t, it is an expression and celebratio­n of culture.  You know, the culture that makes Brooklyn, Brooklyn.  47 people were not shot at the parade (reading is fundamenta­l).  There was 1 shooting on the parade route, that has not happened since 2006.  The event attracts 3 million people and even more $$$$$$$.  Get a life.

The parade brings commerce to the city every weekend. 99.9% of the over million attendees, of all races, show up with out problems. These are a few random teens who would have engaged in this behaviour parade or not.

				There's idiots of EVERY color on this planet. I've lived in Brooklyn for the past 21 years,but I'm not going to defend people of my ethnicity when they do something stupid & needlessly violent. My experience is that in large crowds,any­thing can happen & it usually does. I have found that when I,as a Black American, have attended the West Indian Day parade with friends of other races,even though most parade-goe­rs were welcoming,­there were always a few threats directed toward my non-Black friends & even once (2 years ago) someone randomly punched an Asian friend of mine as we walked by,with no provocatio­n at all. I love the food,the music & the culture,bu­t I celebrate it without the parade.

				Thats ashame , I am glad that you dont defend the violence that happens there . non blacks should be careful when they are in that area during the parade because they will get tested by the ignorant people , your friend getting punched like that shows that people go there to commit random acts of violence towards others . I went there a year or two ago and I have no intentions of going back.

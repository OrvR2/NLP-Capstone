Texas residents quickly fled as wildfire closed in

Posted on September 8, 2011 by Christopher Sherman, Associated Press 

This article has been syndicated.						Dennis Silman was in line at the store when his wife's urgent call came through: They needed to get out. Smoke was drifting up through the woods and the wildfire that just 30 minutes earlier wasn't near enough to pose a problem was visible over the treetops by the time he got home.

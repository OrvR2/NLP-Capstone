U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh has not been shy about criticizing President Obama in the Chicagoland area as of late. While he usually speaks to a supportive crowd of Republicans and Tea Party members, he found himself facing a more critical audience Tuesday: a group of suburban Chicago high school students. 
Walsh stopped by Mundelein High School Tuesday to speak with a pair of AP Government classes, according to the Daily Herald. The stop came just days after announcing that he will not be attending President Barack Obama's Sept. 8 jobs speech and calling the president "idiotic" during another northern Illinois appearance. He later apologized for that remark. 
Walsh reportedly told students that he would read the president's speech, but said that calling a joint session of Congress should be reserved for "pretty big deals," the Chicago Tribune reports. He said that Obama's proposals do not meet that criteria. 
Students asked Walsh about his allegedly unpaid child support, and he once again denied the allegations. In a court filing, his ex-wife claimed that Walsh owed $115,294 in unpaid obligations and interest. He also said that "personal stuff" prevents the best Democrats and Republicans from running for office. 
The Tribune has more on what Walsh heard from some students:  
When asked about the Tea Party and its beliefs, Walsh first turned the question back to students, asking them what they think when they hear the term "Tea Party." Students' responses included: "Republicans," "reducing taxes" and "Fox News."

Self-proclaimed liberal Samuel Cruz, 16, described the Tea Party as "a small group of people who are insane and out of touch with reality."
Walsh defended the Tea Party, describing them as a big group of people who are frustrated about government spending. 
"We're not all insane," he added, according to the Tribune. 
Walsh will be in Illinois again Thursday--while President Obama makes his jobs speech. 
"I'm going to fly back home and talk to the folks who really know what we need to do when it comes to job creation, not this president," he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday.

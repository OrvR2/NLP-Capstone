Rick Perry’s remarks on Social Security stand out at latest debateBy Chris MoodyPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody | The Ticket – 2 hrs 23 mins ago

As expected, Texas Gov. Rick Perry took the brunt of the hits on Wednesday from the other presidential candidates at the latest Republican debate.
Perry hoped to damage the candidacy of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by attacking Romney's record on jobs as governor of Massachusetts, but Perry's comments on Social Security were more memorable. Perry's unapologetically tough rhetoric on the New Deal-era program will be used against him for as long as he stays in the presidential campaign.
Romney made an effort to distinguish himself from Perry on Social Security, a program Perry called a "failure."
Perry doubled down on the tough language he used to describe Social Security in his book, calling the program, among other things, a "monstrous lie" to the nation's young people.
"The issue in the book 'Fed Up' Governor, is you say that by any measure, Social Security is a failure," Romney said to Perry. "You can't say that to tens of millions of Americans who live on Social Security and those who have lived on it."
"A candidate should be committed to saving Social Security," Romney added.
Watch:


Perry defended his past comments when he called Social Security a "Ponzi scheme."
"I don't care what anyone says," Perry said when a debate moderator pointed to two other Republicans who disagreed with his use of the phrase. "We know that, the American people know that, but more importantly, those 25-and-30-year-olds know that."

When pressed on his views on climate change, Perry didn't budge from his comment that scientists have not come to a consensus over its existence.
Here's the exchange between him and moderator John Harris, the editor in chief of Politico, the political news website:
HARRIS: Governor Perry -- Governor Perry, Governor Huntsman were not specific about names, but the two of you do have a difference of opinion about climate change. Just recently in New Hampshire, you said that weekly and even daily scientists are coming forward to question the idea that human activity is behind climate change. Which scientists have you found most credible on this subject?
PERRY: Well, I do agree that there is -- the science is -- is not settled on this. The idea that we would put Americans' economy at -- at-- at jeopardy based on scientific theory that's not settled yet, to me, is just -- is nonsense. I mean, it -- I mean -- and I tell somebody, I said, just because you have a group of scientists that have stood up and said here is the fact, Galileo got outvoted for a spell.
But the fact is, to put America's economic future in jeopardy, asking us to cut back in areas that would have monstrous economic impact on this country is not good economics and I will suggest to you is not necessarily good science. Find out what the science truly is before you start putting the American economy in jeopardy.

after WWI , WWII, Korea, and Vietnam, there were jobs to come home to.  Previously held jobs were mandated to be kept for the returning veterans.  Today, thanks to billy clinton and nafta, the jobs have moved overseas.  Quick example, say Winchester firearms moves to Japan, low tarriffs aloow the company to keep the prices high on their weapons.  Just because they're non-union.  The same with the auto industry, clothing, electrical, everything.  There are NO jobs to be had.  The Postal Service is going under, that's another 650,000 jobs.  Screw nafta, make the politicians fall under their voted in nobama care, make them take DEEP pay cuts and give up niceties.  Get rid of nobama, and don't let him play the race card, his mother IS CAUCASION.  May The Good Lord Jesus Christ protect this nation from our politicians, cabinet, idiotic supreme court, all of them

Let's play Devil's advocate . By his reasoning because you don't have solid proof it does not exist .  We have put God only knows how many pounds of pollution in the air and he still doesn't think it can effect the climate ?  For those of you who believe in this fallacy I really only need to come up with 2 words (If you don't know what they are look them up ! ) Cloud seeding . It exists and is PROOF that we can to some small degree have an effect on  weather . And if you did it on a GRAND scale you would make changes to the climate . People relying on religious scientists for answers  are ALWAYS going to get a skewed answer .
Because they will only find results that confirm they're belief. While I have nothing against them You can't rely solely on them .
 The other part of my devils advocacy is this. If what Perry believes is that because he can't see it it doesn't exist , Then how can he believe in God ? Do you see the hypocrisy yet ?
 I don't care if he believes in God or not .that goes for any body else on the planet .
What I want is a president that wasn't so busy trying to make somebody else look  bad enough as to over shadow his own short comings .  
 Perry trying to use Jobs is one example .And Romney using Social Security is another Let the political mud slinging  begin ! 
  But I will say this Social Security was never intended to be a political piggy bank . It works ,UNLIKE Politicians 
Getting rid of SS is NOT the way to fix America . Getting the LAZY BUMS that live on it while being able to work IS .  Finding a way to put the funds that rightfully belongs to all Americans that have been paying into SS for years IS .
The more I hear about Perry the less I like . We need some to Fix America . Not Fix something that isn't broke .  
ALSO Wouldn't you rather vote for a candidate that bases his campaign  upon his OWN merits ? Rather than vote for him because he managed to sling enough mud at the rest of the candidates ?
I want a president that I would be proud to shake his hand as an individual. NOT because he is President . I want one that I would , IF I knew him personally , be proud to call him a friend.
Wouldn't you ? 
 Or do you want another lying cheating snake in the grass ?

Rick (all hat, no cattle) Parry - Social security is a failure, social security is a ponzi scheme, and there is no scientific consensus that global warming is real and caused by the activites of mankind.

Rush (draft dodging, drug addicted, illegal viagra using, sex tourista) Limbaugh - pensions are a ponzi scheme and pensioners are thieves.

Three cheers for the political and rhetorical leaders of the GOP - they are the only hope that Barrack (Barry White (the best moderate Republican since Bill (NAFTA) Clinton)) Obama has of being re-elected. If it weren't for the Supreme Court it would be worth it to vote for an unelectable 3rd party candidate. Disgusting.

Here is a Used Car Salesman called Clay Cooley.  Looking at both Cooley and Perry, they look like twins!  Wouldn't trust what either one says either.

I just read Texas Gov. Perrys input on the "science" on global warming and I think I lost I.Q. points. Is this guy serious? "Galileo got outvoted for a spell" no shit? The differnece between your thoughts and this is that Galileo was right you twit! How the hell is this man available to run for our highest office? How the hell was Bush able to run for office for that part! No one this devoid of reality should be able to step foot near the election!

It looks like the Republicans are eating themselves again. All we have here is a 72 year old man who thinks people are listening to him, a woman candidate who can't stop quoting the ridiculous and showing everyone that she does not reside in this world. Then there are two Mormons who will never get the backing of the Christian right, because they have already been made Gods, and a man who can't seem to figure out if he is a Republican or a Democrat has never lost an election because he sheds his skin when it is convenient. OH BOY! don't we have an exciting field to chose from YAWN! And if Sarah gets in now we have another loon to listen to. I certainly hope there are some good, adult like Republicans out there, who knows how to win. If not, all I can say is get use to hearing "4 more years! 4 more years!"
I'm an Independent and I see none of these guys or ladies deserve my vote.

My thoughts:  Move all FICA monies to individual 401Ks, move the retirement age to 55, as these people are the largest group of unemployed.  Do away with income tax on businesses and individuals.  Go to a national sales tax of 21%, for 10 years,  Go to two year budgets, on odd years to avoid election pressures, and mandate a 5% reduction each year for 10 years.  Raise the FICA to 10% and Medicare to 4%, unlimited.  This will be the only cost to individuals, and the same rate for everyone....the cost of being an American.  The sales tax will apply to exports and imports, with no exemptions.

Romney recently stated:

“I am convinced this is the time to tell Americans the truth,” said Romney. “We have to be honest and people will do the right thing. The silent majority is less and less silent.” Mitt is right; it is time for truth - even if it is the truth Romney doesn’t want told -

Mitt Romney’s support of enhanced torture is not a difficult stretch. Judge Bybee, Tom Flanagan, Mitchell, Jessen, DeLand, McCotter, were involved in the creation of the enhanced torture program. All are fellow Mormon Church members and Temple recommend holders, the same as Mitt,

Cofer Black, one of Romney’s advisers during his last presidential race, hand was in the selection Mitchell and Jessen’s development of enhanced tortures. Romney welcomed Black to his staff with his announcement:

"I am pleased to welcome Cofer Black to our campaign. He has a long and impressive career dedicated to making America safer and more secure in the world," said Governor Romney. "Our country faces a new generation of challenges and Black's experience at the forefront of our nation's counter-terrorism efforts will be a tremendous asset."

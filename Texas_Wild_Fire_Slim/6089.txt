Paul Brandeis Raushenbush: Ten Years After 9/11: Has Religion Driven Us Apart or Drawn Us Together?


		                        
																9/11 made it clear that religion, which had been ignored and overlooked for decades, was still a force, and perhaps the force in people's personal and communal lives.                            

 






Grace Nasri: The Surge in Islamophobia


							            							            Many may not realize this, but the majority of Muslims are victims of these fringe believers who have all but hijacked Islam, drowned out the religion's message of peace. 							        



 






Don McNay: September 11 Anniversary: A Chance for Main Street to Reflect and Take Economic Action


							            							            Until Washington gets the courage to trust the American people to handle hard and sobering decisions -- and develops a plan of action that does not favor one interest group over another -- real economic solutions are not going to come from Washington.							        



 






Joshua Stanton: The Interfaith Movement Steps Up to Commemorate 9/11


							            							            Perhaps galvanized to action by last year's spate of Islamophobia, this summer has been one of planning and coalescence for the interfaith movement. The goal is clear, tangible and immediate: to ensure that the commemoration of 9/11 is not an excuse for venom...							        



 






Christian de la Huerta: On 9/11 Anniversary, Love Your Enemy


							            							            How much longer will we walk around with anger and resentment in our hearts, feeling wronged and victimized? Forgiveness is an act of personal liberation. Not doing it keeps us stuck in the past.							        



 






Rev. Earl E. Johnson: Providing Disaster Relief with the American Red Cross, 10 Years After 9/11


							            							            What has emerged in my experience is that those who have training and experience with the chronically ill also make good disaster spiritual care providers, without exception.

							            							            It'll be a balancing act for journalists to cover the emotions of the 9/11 anniversary: without sacrificing the facts, they will also have to maintain some responsibility.

				As the tenth anniversar­y of the tragic events of 9-11 approach, it is right and proper, that chaplains and all of us reflect on this sad chapter in our history.
But what do we really reflect on and how do we really reflect on, what we are supposed to reflect on, if we don't really know, what really happened? Can a really honest and realistic reflection­, take place without real knowledge of the event?

				Regarding 9/11, there are two distinct issues involved. The fact of what took place on that day and the tragic loss of lives and our empathy for those who were in any way adversely affected.
And as tragic is not knowing after ten years exactly what led to 9/11 and who was truly behind it and why which is unfortunat­e in our supposedly free and democratic society. 

I was going to suggest for those interested to take time and watch the documentar­y "Loose Change 9/11: An American Coup" that I watched yesterday on Netflix and I believe it is the same one on your list.

I was astonished to hear the possibilit­y that Osama bin Laden might not have had as much to do with 9/11 as we have been led to believe. I was surprised to hear that the personal lives of many of those directly involved in high jacking of the planes had nothing to do with Islam they professed to be adherents to. 

It was puzzling the realize how much our government knew about the possibilit­y of the attack as was the case when Japan attached Pearl Harbor six decades earlier and did nothing about it.
Your question, "Can a really honest and realistic reflection­­, take place without real knowledge of the event?" is legitimate and the answer has to be, "No!"

Our responsibi­lity is, however, to continue seeking the truth as a requiremen­t to keep our society free and democratic­.

				I see a vision of countless crosses, endless crosses stretching over the freshly dug fields. But it is only a memory. I feel the pains that were given, that I gave, on so many days of loss. And, there is no light to free me from these shadows which cage me. I know I should have been dead long ago and suspect that perhaps I did indeed die, long ago. I cry out to God. I seek his consolatio­­­­n. But I know that he cannot help me. I have created my own prison in which I am the only prisoner and the only guard.

				Yea, and maybe if some people rubbed their rabbits foot just one more time, Puff the Magic Dragon will appear.  Why on earth do you non believers have to always criticize?  Just remember the victims and their families.  If you don't believe in prayer, send good wishes and just once stop making an issue a battle ground!

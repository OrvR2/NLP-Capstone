Terrell Owens is in tears over some financial issues By      MJD


Tuesday night, we shared the story of Terrell Owens advising DeSean Jackson to sit out until the Eagles give him more money. Springing forth Wednesday is this video that shows that T.O.'s "get all the money you can" message could be grounded in some personal issues he's facing.
 
The T.O. Show 3 - TV Shows - Full Episode Video - Reality TV Shows
Here's a snippet of T.O. explaining his problems.
"Football season is on a standstill, so I have no income at this point. None. On top of that, you're talking about the mortgage of all the real estate that I do have. And on top of that, child support."

I'm not a financial expert or a TV producer, but shouldn't VH1 be giving you a little bit of money for doing that television show? You're not crying on television for free, are you? If you're going to be exploited, make sure there's at least a check coming.
Best of luck to the guy.

0 users disliked this comment Realist 5 hours ago Report Abuse If Terrel is really broke, I have no sympathy for him. I hate to say, but how the hell someone can make over 100 million dollars over their career and be broke today? I guess easy come easy go, someone like me who hard all my life and appreciates my little income would never made that mistake, period!

0 users disliked this comment Baron 7 hours ago Report Abuse Didn't he say last year that the 2 million dollar contract he got from the Bengals was "almost like playing for free."   LOL-   I don't know that these are real tears.   Probably just trying to hype up his show.   If he is broke this quick then something is seriously wrong.

How can anyone be expected to make ends meet after only making about $100 million in your career?   Come on people have a heart and dig out your wallets to help poor TO.   (Idiot)

0 users disliked this comment paul 15 hours ago Report Abuse My neighbor just got laid off (suddenly without warning) because the car plant he has worked in for 21 years is downsizing. He has a mortgage and a wife and kids to feed. He didn't have time to cry - he was busy finding another job so that he could put food on the table .... Anyone who feels sorry for Owens should have their head examined.

Maybe, and I'm just throwing this out there, maybe he should stop buying 2000 dollar raybands and diamond earrings. I have no sympathy for pro athletes, especially ones of his caliber, who go broke. Learn to budget like the rest of us and live within your means. If he has a child to support and lives alone why the hell does he need giant mansion with a basketball court in it.

1 users disliked this comment Noodles 17 hours ago Report Abuse you guys censored my post? Since when is m-o-r-on a swear word? Someone else can call the guy a dipwad and m-o-ron isn't allowed/accepted? Talk about selective censorship.  

TO is m-oron - millions of dollars in a contract and he can't seem to save a dollar on his mortgage and starts crying over it? Really my mini violin is playing "my heart bleeds for him". what a whiner.

He needs to take a break from his fantasy world.   TOs next reality show should be based on working 48 hours a week for 40k/yr while driving nothing but a chrsyler!!!

0 users disliked this comment Evil Resident 19 hours ago Report Abuse What a shmuck. Why not down-size?    Try selling one of your half dozen homes, sell your Lamborghini and buy a GM instead. How anyone can possibly feel sorry for the guy is beyond me. People make do on welfare and this @#$%-clown can't make a living? GTFO

0 users disliked this comment Noodles 20 hours ago Report Abuse let me get this straight - you make millions of dollars, each season...and you have no money to pay your mortgage? @#$%? Boo-freaking-hoo...Talk to me when you've been jobless, searching for months, have almost no money and really have bills stacking up...
Tears...he's crying? What a joke. And this has ZERO to do with his race. A @#$% with money is a @#$% without money, because he didn't get the proper financial advice and squandered all of it. He's a @#$%. he should be crying because he knows that he's an IDIOT.

9 users disliked this comment carolL 20 hours ago Report Abuse I am just so tired of all of the racism. All of the people who are eaten up by this sickness just can't wait to explode at any given time. No decent person would just wallow in someones bad times, no matter what it is. TO is an excellent athlete, as well as philanthropist. It is sick to throw mud at a person because of jealousy, hatred and racism.

8 users disliked this comment LOL 21 hours ago Report Abuse I find it hilarious how some white people love to yell they are not racist, oh why must the race card come out, blah blah blah, and yet, when a black man has failed, as white people do too, magically race matters. If race doesn't matter why do you even acknowledge the difference between black and white? I find that very funny, please own it.... alot of you know you love to see a black person down whether it is his fault or not, just be honest about it, he will not be able to qualify for any of your welfare or food stamps just because you try to keep that infamous "race card" tucked away until you feel like using it.Comment hidden due to low rating.

3 users disliked this comment don 21 hours ago Report Abuse Terrell Owens gets big money for coming to Las Vegas and sitting his @#$% at a night club.    So he has money coming in from the NFL and TV Shows!    If he cant afford the mortgages maybe he should sell the property.    He can go tell ESPN he qualifies for Section Eight housing like all his brothers in the hood. Then get on food stamps so my tax dollars can go to support his broke, @#$%!

0 users disliked this comment K 22 hours ago Report Abuse I am sick of stories like this.   We are not talking about people that have lost their job when they were earning $20 an hour.   Athletes that made millions and have nothing?   It is crap and not news worthy.   Take a look at the humble 5 ft 4 college basketball player Eric Valentin...that is someone my children can look up to even though they are taller than him.

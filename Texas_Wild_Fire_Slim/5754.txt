If you're going to be watching the GOP Presidential debate tonight, you might as well have fun while doing so. And with the help of our official drinking game below, you shouldn't have any problem.
You might already be familiar with our State Of The Union drinking games, but this one is tailored specifically for tonight's debate. 
What will Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum reveal about their platforms tonight? Whether it's talk of "job creators," "taking back America," or "Obamacare," we've covered (most of) the bases and paired them with funny drinking "suggestions." Be safe and have fun!
NOTE: The Huffington Post in no way encourages binge drinking. This is the comedy section. If you actually drank as much as we suggested you would die, so do not do that.

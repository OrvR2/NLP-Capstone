Welcome,
This is the official Quick Contact for WordPress site.
Quick Contact has been updated to v0.5.3, download it now!

Quick Contact for Wordpress is exactly that: a no-frills simple way to add a contact form to your Wordpress blog. Simply load it into your plugins folder, insert the shortcode on your Contact Us page, and whammo!; you have a contact us form.
Users can complete a basic set of fields to contact you, and will be required to enter a simple Captcha to keep you from getting spammed to death. That’s it; Quick Contact.

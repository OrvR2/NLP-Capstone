Medal of Honor recipient highlights Marine’s valor as well as risks US troops faced under controversial rules of engagementBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – 13 hrs ago

On Thursday, President Obama will award the Medal of Honor to Marine Sgt. Dakota Meyer.
Meyer will become the third living recipient--and first Marine--to be awarded the Medal of  Honor for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan, the White House said. He is also the first living former Marine to receive the highest U.S. military honor since the Vietnam war, a Marine Corps press officer told The Envoy Wednesday.
The heroic conduct Meyer displayed in retrieving the bodies of four fellow Marines killed in battle occurred during a September 2009 battle in Kunar Province, Afghanistan. The rules of engagement for the conflict have caused controversy and some bitterness.

Meyer was serving as a member of a Marine Corps training team embedded with Afghan National Army forces in Gangjal, Afghanistan on September 8, 2009.
"A full moon was drenching the mountains in ghostly light as some 60 Afghan soldiers, 20 border police officers, 13 Marine and U.S. Army trainers and I set out for Ganjgal at 3 a.m. from the U.S. base in the Shakani District," McClatchy national security reporter Jonathan Landay, who was embedded with the unit at the time, reported in September 2009.
As the team came under insurgent fire and rocket attack, however, U.S. commanders repeatedly denied the request to provide air cover, under new rules of engagement designed to reduce civilian casualties.
"U.S. commanders, citing new rules to avoid civilian casualties, rejected repeated calls to unleash artillery rounds at attackers dug into the slopes and tree lines — despite being told repeatedly that they weren't near the village," Landay reported. "We waited more than an hour for U.S. helicopters to arrive, despite earlier assurances that air cover would be five minutes away."
By the time helicopters arrived, four U.S. Marines had been killed, as well as eight Afghan troops and the US Marine commander's Afghan interpreter.
"The Marines were cut down as they sought cover in a trench at the base of the village's first layer cake-style stone house," Landay reported. "One Marine was bending over a second, tending his wounds, when both were killed, said Marine Cpl. Dakota Meyer, 21, of Greensburg, Ky., who retrieved their bodies."
Meyer, born in 1986, retired from the Marines in June 2010, and now lives in Kentucky.
The last living former Marine to receive the Medal of Honor was in 1973: "Now-retired [Marine] Sgt. Maj. Allan Kellogg . . . received the Medal from President Nixon at the White House on Oct 15, 1973," Military Times' Dan Lamothe reported.

give no quarter to the enemy.  take the fight to everyone like they did in the wars we have won.  the civilian population will get tired of being killed because of a bunch of fanatics and will clean their own house.

"U.S. commanders repeatedly denied the request to provide air cover". 
+=================================
These commanders need to resign. Withdraw all of our troops if they make them fight with 1 arm tied behind their back!

If we had the same rules in WWII we would all be speaking German, doing the goose step and murdering minorities and Jews. Whats going to come of this action, murdering non believers?

Rules of combat cause US soldiers deaths ? War is war you foolish politicians and you are sacraficing our guys for enemy combatants. Stupid ! Enemy fire should be met immediatly with heavy annialating fire which totaly destroys or wounds everything that moves from the assalt area.

Politics have contolled the way we fight wars since Korea. This has caused THOUSANDS of American lives just to be politically correct. War is war. People die. Sometimes the wrong ones but we can't help that. Did anyone think that the enemy chooses from where the fight from to cause more innocent deaths and get our anti american media to cry about it.

People who have never fought, who's children will never fight, people who are thousands of miles away from the nasty, brutal reality of war, are making the rules.

There is a contradiction in the article. Landay says "despite being told repeatedly that they weren't near the village," Then he says "they sought cover in a trench at the base of the village's first layer cake-style stone house," I don't know, maybe they were to close. Either way it implies that there are no civilians around and I would agree that this rule most likely is the cause for several of the deaths.

If you aren't going to wage war and assault the enemy, then get the F%^& out!!! Its the equivalent of telling the person that you're up against that you aren't go to really fight hard and you're not going to defend yourself fully. This president is killing our young men by making them fight with "sensitivity". When was the last time the animals that we're fighting fought cleanly and fairly? They strap bombs on to children - they blow up markets and schools. Wage war and kill these animals or get out!

Congrats liberals, you murdered marines because you won't allow air support because you are afraid some civilians might get injured. Libs disgust me.

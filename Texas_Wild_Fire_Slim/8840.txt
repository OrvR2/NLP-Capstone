   The Vendor Shootout™ for ERP, 'Co-opetition to the Fullest Extent'PRWeb – 7 hrs ago





   An event for mid-sized manufacturing, distribution companies to determine an evaluation “short list” for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) SoftwareGreensboro, NC (PRWEB) September 08, 2011  Taking the headache out of software selection for several years, the Vendor Shootout™ for ERP is continuing to gain popularity among executives in the manufacturing and distribution industries, as well as in the press.  In August 2011, the 11th installment of the Vendor Shootout™ for ERP, held in Boston, MA, once again provided manufacturing and distribution organizations the rare opportunity to see live, scripted product demonstrations from the top Enterprise Software vendors, under one roof.  
As with all of the past events, Technology Evaluation Centers (TEC) of Montreal, Canada, served as the event’s unbiased moderator.  In attendance at the event was TEC Principal Analyst P.J. Jakovljevic.  As a neutral, yet active observer, P.J. had the opportunity to gain insight on the event from the attendees’ perspective, in terms of value and vendor performance.  He was also able to engage with all of the participating vendors.  P.J. has since published an objective article “Demystifying ‘Vendor Shootout™ for ERP’ Events, via the TEC blog, that summarizes his experience at the event, along with some of the candid feedback he received.  In his article, P.J. takes us back to the 1st event and how this unique concept came to fruition.  He also sheds some light on the behind the scenes organization of the event, by Oracle JD Edwards partner brij Image and Information, based in Greensboro, NC. 
Over four years ago, when asked about the concept and objective behind creating such an event alongside the competition, one of the Vice Presidents of brij had the following to say:
“I am SO confident that my product stands up against the competition that I would be willing to line it up alongside those competitors and in front of some project-minded individuals to demonstrate what it can do in a controlled environment. Our competitors will do the same thing, and the attending audience will be allowed, without bias, to make up their own minds as to what products look good to them in terms of functionality, usability, and efficiency.”
The 12th Vendor Shootout™ for ERP is scheduled for October 12-13, 2011 in Dallas, Texas.  For additional information, sponsorship opportunities or to register for the 12th Vendor Shootout™ for ERP at Early Bird rates visit http://www.erpshootout.com or call 877.907.2702.

Astronauts' tracks, trash seen in new moon photosBy SETH BORENSTEIN - AP Science Writer | AP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011
REUTERS - NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) image released on September 6, 2011 shows the Apollo 17 site on the moon, where the tracks laid down by the lunar rover are clearly visible, along with the …more  last foot trails left on the moon. The images also show where the astronauts placed some of the scientific instruments that provided the first insight into the moon's environment and interior. LRO captured the sharpest images ever taken from space of the Apollo 12, 14 and 17 landing sites. Images show the twists and turns of the paths made when the astronauts explored the lunar surface. NASA says the image brightness and contrast have been altered to highlight surface details.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A spacecraft circling the moon has snapped the sharpest photos ever of the tracks and trash left behind by Apollo astronauts in their visits from 1969 to 1972.Images taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter from 13 to 15 miles up show the astronauts' paths when they walked on the moon, as well as ruts left by a moon buggy. Experts could even identify the backpacks astronauts pitched out of their lunar landers before they returned to Earth."What we're seeing is a trail," said Arizona State University geology professor Mark Robinson, the orbiter's chief scientist. "It's totally awesome."However, the photos were not close enough to see individual bootprints, Robinson said.The pictures were taken two weeks ago and show the landing sites for Apollo 12, 14 and 17. The closest images are of the 1972 Apollo 17 site, the last moon mission.Apollo 17 Commander Eugene Cernan wrote in an email to The Associated Press that the photo gives him a chance to revisit those days, "this time with a little nostalgia and disappointment. Nostalgia because those special days are fondly etched in my memory and disappointment because it looks like now we will not be going back within the days I have left on this planet."Two years ago, images from the same spacecraft from 30 and 60 miles out showed fuzzier images. But this year the orbiter dipped down to take about 300,000 more close-ups. The trails left by the astronauts are clear, but the places where backpacks were discarded, Apollo 17's moon buggy, and the bottom parts of the three lunar landers are blurry."You have to really look at it for a long time to figure out what you're looking at," Robinson said. For example, when it comes to the moon buggy he said, "if you squint really hard you can resolve the wheels and that the wheels are slightly turned to the left."At first, scientists thought they had a bit of a mystery: They saw more stuff than they expected. It turned out to be packing material and an insulation blanket, Robinson said.After 40 years there does not seem to be much moon dust covering the manmade trails. It probably will take about 10 million to 100 million years for dust to cover them, Robinson said.The photos were released a few days after the debut of the new fictional movie "Apollo 18" and before Thursday's planned launch of NASA's twin robotic spaceships to explore the moon's gravity.___Online:NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter: http://1.usa.gov/qTrKRwArizona State University Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera page:http://www.lroc.asu.edu/

It happened people, get over it, we landed on the moon. It's the moon, not Jupiter, not so strange, and indeed not impossible. Unlike you, there are some people out there that have the intelligence to make things like this possible.

LOL! I love how in the video clips it has the astronauts jumping high and in big strides and yet the tracks look like someone walked while dragging their feet! Stupid America (Yes sadly I am technically American, but I can think on my own) Oh well, this country keeps getting dumber and dumber, the 911 #$%$ was put together even worse than this and JFK put together. I hope we get overthrown sometime.

Reading a NASA article is like listening to Uncle Sam talk about how he went all state in High School 50 years ago. They haven't made progress in ages and unless they find a way to turn moon rocks into fuel I don't want to hear about them sucking money from our government like their Chinese.

This is not so much a moon story.  It's a satellite surveillance story.  More than a quarter of a million photos were taken from 30 to 60 miles with resolution sufficient to make out a back pack.  Do you ever get the feeling that someone is watching you?

not all people are as stupids as the americans or those who believe in this news.... people, think first... use your common sense... who come they had trails/tracks? Do they know that in moon the people are so light. As light as a paper that very impossible to leave a track! I pity those who believe in this news. Your government, particularly the NASA, wants only to milk the people (disguised as budget) only to use it to fund their vested interest! Wake up Americans!

Let me say this, and it's a 100% proven, indisputable FACT:

If you think the 6 (that's right, there were 6 of them) moon landings were faked, you have an IQ which is sub-90.   That is a proven fact, and documented over and over and over.  

Recently, it has been shown that those who think the moon landings were faked, also are certain that Obama wasn't born in Hawaii, is a Muslim and that 9/11 was an "inside job".

There is no room on our planet for people this dumb.  They need to be tucked safely away from normal society.

Humans cannot get through the radiation belts without thick lead shields. We've never been to the moon and we never will, but there are plenty of plasma entities on there right now who cold have made these trails for them. It's all a fairytale.

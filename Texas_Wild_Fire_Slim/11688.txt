It is required in Texas to have a timber sales contract when selling timber.  A timber sales contract will help clarify what trees are to be sold, when the sale is to take place, how much is going to be paid per unit, what method is being used to determine volume or weight ($/cord, $/thousand board feet, $/ton, etc),  how payment will be delivered ( all at once, weekly, monthly, etc), date when that payment should be delivered, who is responsible for damages and repairs to resources on the property, guidelines like Best Management Practices that will need to be followed to protect the property, etc.  A good contact will help protect the landowner during the timber harvesting process and clearly state what will take place on the property.  There are smple contract formats at the end of this document for reference, but the professional forester you work with will have a contract format applicable to the type of timber sale you will be engaged in.

And NYC Still Unverified September 10, 2011 |  Filed underHeadlines |  Posted by Loraine Henrickson U.S. Police Alert From Terrorism ThreatUnited States counterterrorism authorities are on the trail of a credible but unverified al Qaeda terrorism threat.  The plot allegedly aims to car bomb bridges or tunnels in Washington D.C. or New York City (NYC). The plot uncovered days before the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks is timed to coincide with its commemoration. The September 11 attack occurred a decade ago which killed over 3,000 people. New York City and Washington D.C. police departments announced they would deploy more officers in response to the terrorism threat.Terrorism Threat Originated From PakistanAccording to Bob Orr of CBS News homeland security correspondent, the plot originated from Pakistan. The country is thought to be the hideout of al Qaeda’s remaining core leaders, including Ayman al Zawahiri. A U.S. official claimed to Orr the original intelligence source provided needed specifics regarding dates, locations, methods and personnel to suggest that it is a credible threat. The information suggested that the terrorist group planned to plant the bomb in a car on one or both cities. Both NYC and D.C. were the previous targets of the September 11 terrorist attacks. So for this reason, the NYC and D.C. police are very responsive to the threat.Terrorism Threat Still UnverifiedCounterterrorism authorities are probing on the terrorism threat throughout Thursday night ’till Friday. However, the plot remains unverified. The FBI, CIA and other agencies are in full swing to disprove or verify the information. Bob Orr reported that U.S. counterterrorism agents are in pursuit of three people who might be traveling to or who have recently arrived in the country. This intelligence is based on the detailed information gathered by the U.S. intelligence community since late Wednesday.Al Qaeda Has Planned To Attack This YearCounterterrorism and law enforcement authorities have been keenly watching for any threat. This after intelligence gathered from Osama bin Laden’s citadel in Pakistan indicated that al Qaeda had planned attacking the U.S. during this year’s anniversary. Other significant American dates were also considered. U.S. authorities were also concerned that terrorists would use the anniversary to retaliate against the U.S. for killing Osama bin Laden. The al Qaeda leader was killed in a military raid in May this year.In this article you learned that the terrorism threat is still under investigation by U.S. counterterrorism authorities.  The plot aims to bomb cars, bridges or tunnels in NYC or Washington D.C. The bombing is to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Authorities say the threat is credible but yet to be verified.Other Related Articles:Al Qaeda -  Leon Panetta Says Defeating Al Qa...

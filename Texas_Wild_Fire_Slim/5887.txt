Texas wildfires claim 700 homes, force evacuationsAFP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

Crews in Texas Tuesday battled dozens of wildfires that have destroyed more than 700 homes in just two days and forced thousands to flee thick smoke and flames.
"This is one of the meanest fires I've ever seen," Texas Governor Rick Perry told reporters after an aerial tour of the homes destroyed in the Steiner Ranch subdivision.
"The magnitudes of these losses are pretty stunning." 
The Republican White House hopeful had been campaigning in South Carolina ahead of a major debate on Wednesday night when the fires swept through subdivisions and towns near the state capitol of Austin.
He bowed out of several events so he could survey the damage and meet with evacuees.
The fires have been fanned by winds from a tropical depression that hit the southern United States over the weekend and have flared across ground left tinder dry by an intense summer drought, killing at least two people.
The worst blaze remains uncontrolled after devouring 30,000 acres (47 square miles or 121 square kilometers) and nearly 600 homes in Bastrop county, prompting mass evacuations as weather forecasts suggested the situation would get worse before it gets better.
More than 250 fire personnel battled the blaze in Bastrop, with planes and helicopters dumping water from above, but across the state the crews struggled to refill at lakes and rivers drained by the long, hot drought.
"There's practically a fleet of aircraft in the air," said Jan Amen, a Forest Service spokeswoman in Bastrop. "Problem is, we have to share them with other fires because there's so many burning in the area."
In East Texas, a fast-moving fire is believed to have killed a 20-year-old woman and her child, who failed to get out of their trailer home fast enough.
Gregg County Sheriff Maxey Cerliano told reporters the victims were found dead near Gladewater, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east of Fort Worth.
 Firefighters have responded to 181 blazes that have burned more than 118,000 acres in the past week, according to the latest situation report from the Texas Forest Service.
More than 3.5 million acres -- about the size of the state of Connecticut -- have been burned by 18,719 blazes since the wildfire season began in December.
Officials have ruled out arson as the cause of the fires and instead blame Tropical Depression Lee, which  was graded as a more serious tropical storm when it came ashore in southern Louisiana early Sunday.

Hopefully those people fleeing the fires in Texas will be treated better than they themselves treated the people fleeing Katrina.

What a bunch of #$%$ mindless morons on this site.  Regardless of whether you're a democrat or republican, put yourself and your home,  in this fire situation.  How do you think you'd feel if it was happening to you....and you morons are putting a political spin to this???  And, don't be bashing Texans as ALL southerners, they've moved into Texas from other parts of the U.S.  You know the parts that don't have a good economy but Texas does.  And, if they want help for the federal government...so be it., they put in more than their fair share.  So grow up.  Quit sniffing your crappy underwear, you're getting #$%$ for brains.  Signed X-yankee living in Texas.

Attention satan followers... Your comments are offensive and wayyyyy outta line. people are losing their homes/lives out here due to these wildfires and you find it funny? you are blessed and you dont even realize it, obviously you still have your homes, family, and whatever else you cherish. How could you have so much hate in your hearts that you wish this upon another human being? Well, I believe in GOD and Im sure he doesnt tolerate your ignorant behavior but I will do what's best and pray for you all! God bless you!

Throw Wet Teabags on the fire and then vote conservatives into oblivion. Firefighters should be reserved to the people who want to pay their fair share of taxes without whining.




 






Surfer

Conservatives do not want to fund fire fighters or their health care or the resources to fight these fires. It would be great if we could leave them to god and putting out fires with Wet teabaggers.

I feel empathy for Texans caught up in this nightmare.
Prayer isn't going to get 'em out of harm's way though. Hard work, sacrifice, and charitable offerings from around the country along with a some good luck for a change would do a lot of good.
Best Wishes from Arizona, we know a few things about wildfires.

I feel for Texans, Rick Perry, on the other hand, is an @ss of the highest order. Americans and this country do not need for him to leave Texas.

Homes and lives are being lost and some of you use this tragic misfortune to spew your hate. You should be ashamed.

Sad but bad Government choices on infrastructure the East Coast is drowning while the west is burning down. Build some undergroundwater flows to move water from one part of the country to another. We got prisoners laying around in cells doing nothing let them do something to benefit this country maybe take some time off there sentence in exchange for there work. Waste of manpower and the labor cost would  be less~~~ Just a thought on my person maybe I,m wrong seems logical~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Texas .....  I just want to send a note of condolence & compassion in this time when Texas is being trashed by many who are posting this morning. I am sorry for your trouble and I hope AND PRAY that soon the fires will be out,  that you will get the rain you need and the healing and rebuilding can begin. I want to let you know that I am a liberal, a real live lefty, living in California, and that my wife, a female, of the opposite sex, and I both wish that people would be a little more compassionate than they have been. Having said that, I hope that some of you will realize that the people who are trashing you are returning the kind of attitude they have often experienced in the posts of people claiming to be from Texas. I hope you will take this opportunity to realize that most liberals are employed and work as hard as you do, they pay taxes, just like you do, most have never been on welfare and will probably never be on welfare. Not all Liberals are atheists and not all Conservatives are Christians. But athiest Americans and Christian Americans are still both equally American. I happen to be Catholic. I don't waste any time wondering whether atheists or Buddhists or Protestants are any less American than me, and I hope that we can stop speaking as if  those not like
us are not as American as we.  Liberals join the military and fight for their country, just like you do, and some die fighting for their country right next to conservatives who die also. So, when the fires are out, maybe you will take time to consider that we are all Americans and what should bind us together as a country should be more important than our regional differences or our political differences, and I hope those of us on the left will do the same.
Having said that , I wish my fellow Americans in Texas well, and I look forward to the fires going out so you can get back to trashing Senator Boxer and I can get back to trashing Governor Perry.

This goes to show that the TEA PARTY policies are working. Smaller government REALLY works, read smaller fire depts manpower means that
the firefighters is overwhelmed by the lack of firefighters able to put out the fires. Remember smaller government means few employees. Whether it is military, ICE (they cannot employ proper levels) fewer cops who will be able to solve crimes. This will be a bank robbers paradise. Fewer employees all over mean inconvience to the public. However this is what the TEA PARTY wants smaller government.

I work in Dallas a few times a year and really like the people there. It's a bit conservative for me...but I feel sorry for them having this happen. On the other hand...there is a very funny note here: Rick Perry prayed for rain at his big Houston Christian thing and what did he get...FIRE! Tells you something right there...as s hole!

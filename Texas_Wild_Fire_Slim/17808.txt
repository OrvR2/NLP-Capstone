Bastrop Texas Wildfire | Firefighter Blog






AUSTIN — Two people died in an uncontained wildfire that continued its hellish march Tuesday toward the city of Bastrop.
The blaze has burned 33,089 acres of Bastrop County farmland and forest and destroyed 550 homes, emptying 20 neighborhoods and leaving 4,300 other households without power, said Victoria Koenig, a Texas Forest Service spokeswoman.
Forest Service spokesman John Nichols said the Bastrop County Complex fire, as it has been named, is the most destructive wildfire on record in Texas.

Bastrop County Sheriff Terry Pickering declined to provide specifics about the deaths other than to say the victims weren't uniformed personnel. The bodies haven't been identified, he said.
More than 250 firefighters from around the country have come to Bastrop to help, among them 10 firefighters, four brush trucks and a command truck from the Alamo Area Regional Strike Team.

One of the most valuable tools in forestry is the written management plan that is provided by a professional forester.  Trees increase in value with age in many circumstances so planning for the future is a good practice to ensure that you are not selling trees now that may gain significantly in value in a few years.  A management plan guides management on the different forests types present on your property and how to achieve your goals for the property through treatments.  It also details the different types of additional resources that are present and the ways that you can manage all of them to not only maximize production, but also protect, enhance and gain the greatest benefit from the land.  At the core of any plan is a good map (frequently aerial photography) that gives you a good view of the property, it’s boundaries, different stands as well as the different notable resources present.  From the map you can gain useful information that will aid in managing the property to meet your objectives.  The management recommendations in the plan will give you useful insight into the variety of management alternatives for the property on a stand by stand basis.  It will also give you information on protecting the forest resources including: preventing soil erosion, preventing pest and disease problems and generally improving the overall composition of the forest.  Management plans will also have soil information, wildlife management recommendations and a schedule of activities to help you plan the implementation of the different activities.  Once you have a plan you can then make good decisions on the next steps to take to achieve your goals for the property.  A professional forester can assist you with the creation of a plan to help guide management activities on the property.
A professional forester will be able to assist you in the selling timber process by:
• Designating the trees to be cut
• Estimate the volume to be sold
• Soliciting bids from timber buyers
• Assist in preparing timber sales contracts and specify special conditions related to the timer sale (wet weather logging restrictions, stream crossing specifications, repair of roads, protection of fences and other structures, etc.)
• Checking on cutting operations
• Assess the value of excessive damages if they occur

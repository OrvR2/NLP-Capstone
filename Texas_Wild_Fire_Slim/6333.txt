Mayor Bloomberg suggested that a black city councilman and a top city aide, also black, get a beer with the police officers who threw them to the ground and handcuffed them during Monday's West Indian Day parade in Brooklyn. 
"I assume it'll probably turn out to be just a misunderstanding," Bloomberg told reporters in Lower Manhattan Wednesday morning. "The police have a job to do and the city councilman has a job to do and hopefully, every once in a while, if there's a misunderstanding, that they have a beer together and work it out."

Bloomberg's suggestion calls to mind the famous "beer summit" held at the White House in 2009 between black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., white Cambridge, Mass., police Sgt. James Crowley, who had arrested him for disorderly conduct, and Obama, who declared on national TV that the police had "acted stupidly".
City Councilman Jumaane Williams and Kirsten Jon Foy, an aide to public advocate Bill de Blasio, held a press conference of their own on Tuesday, where they claimed their detention by NYPD officers Monday was symptomatic of stop-and-frisk policies that unfairly target black and hispanic men. 
Williams and Foy said they had police permission to walk on a blocked-off sidewalk Monday, while on their way to a post-parade event at the Brooklyn Museum. 
Police officers, apparently unaware that the two were city officials, confronted Williams and Foy. An argument ensued until cops eventually threw Williams and Foy to the ground and handcuffed them (see video here). After 30 minutes, and once their identities were confirmed, they were released. 
Police commissioner Ray Kelly formally apologized to Williams and Foy, and said the NYPD is conducting an internal investigation of the incident.
City coucilwoman Letitia James also spoke at the press conference Tuesday in support of Williams and Foy. 
First addressing the horrible violence that marred the West Indian Day parade, James said that the city's safety shouldn't come at the expense of civil rights.

				First off the problem begins where the violence begins. There were a 100 people shot in 1 week in the 5 boroughs of New York.  Look at the primary areas of the shootings, and where do you think they are? They aren't in Bayside or Little Neck, but the Bronx and Brooklyn.  Should we as a society just let the criminals run rampant because they're black, latino, or white? Maybe we should let the police go into these neighborho­ods and do their jobs. I'd rather them go save the lives of innocent people, and hurt the feelings of the community. Tell the Mother who just lost her 2 year old to random gunfire that the police in her neighborho­od are targeting minorities­.

I am sure their is equal fault on both sides, but if Jumanee Williams was a leader he would've listened when the cop told him no you can't come this way, but instead he said pretty much I'll do what I want with my posse of 30, and you can't do a thing about it. This is why there is no order because the leaders of communitie­s have no respect for the law, and what they're told. Secondly, who was doing all that shooting this weekend at the West Indian day parade? That is the most violent parade probably in the country. It's absolutely disgracefu­l that parade is still allowed to happen.

				What is ailing the race situation in NYC, especially as it relates to young Black and Latino men is not going to be solved over a few drinks.

For decades now New York City and by extension most of it's political establishm­ent has moved to cater towards the liberal, mainly white upper middle class and above surburban minded that the city has so blatantly made obvious are the ones who count. Your average minority person feels they have little or no say or even choices anymore.


Know persons of colour and or latins who haved moved down south and prefer things there than much of the North East including NY.

Being a black or latino man in this city must be pretty much like having a target taped to one's back.  Everyone from shop clerks to LE hones in them at once regardless of what else is going on. The little dust up at the West Indian Day  parade proves that no matter how high one has rised in this city race and or skin color still determines how others will interact.

NYPD busts young minority teens for pot, yet here on the UES you can't get away from  white youngsters smoking the stuff up and down the streets. They sit on stoops, in front of buildings, walking up and down Fifth, Park, Madison avenues puffing away. LE patrols just cruise on by and have yet to see a foot patrol officer "stop and frisk" one yet.

				Typically obnoxious. Down playing serious misconduct and even criminal conduct by police. "The police have a job to do" is his answer for every time an officer is out of line, which is plenty in NYC. Kelly won't even acknowledg­e police crime and corruption­. They both act like it doesn't exist even when it's staring them right in the face. Boomberg is always saying something extremely negative that has little chance of ever affecting hiim is no big deal. Those men will only have a beer with those cops if Bloomberg pays them to do it, which is the way he's handled his entire NYC policital career.

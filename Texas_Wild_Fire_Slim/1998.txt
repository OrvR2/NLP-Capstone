SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The principal of a small private school in the suburbs of the state capital was arrested Wednesday on charges that he fondled at least seven girls over the past 15 years, months after he was accused of touching female students under their clothes.
Robert Benson Adams, 60, was the owner and principal of the Creative Frontiers School in Citrus Heights, a middle-class suburb about 20 miles northeast of Sacramento. It was shut down in mid-July after a complaint was filed by the California Department of Social Services.
Adams has denied the allegations and said he welcomed "a full investigation" at a press conference a few days after the closure of the school.
"But I assure you, I am very confident that nothing inappropriate has happened," he said then.
Adams now faces six felony counts of committing lewd and lascivious acts on children under 14 and one misdemeanor charge of annoying or molesting a child under 18, according to a criminal complaint filed in Sacramento County Superior Court. He was scheduled to be arraigned Friday.
The girls, who were between 4 and 7, told investigators that Adams, known as "Mr. Bob" to his students, often called them into his office, where he would pull them onto his lap and fondled them, according to the complaint.
Citrus Heights Police Chief Christopher Boyd said more witnesses have come forward since July and that the most recent crime occurred this June.
"We took the time that was necessary to find the facts and the truth that has resulted in these charges being filed today," Boyd said.
Two teachers separately told investigators they walked in on Adams touching young girls.
Bethany Soloman, a teacher at the school, said she saw Adams put his hand under the skirt of a young girl who was sitting on his lap in his office in 2007, according to the complaint. It did not say whether she reported the incident then.
Preschool teacher April Thompson, who was listed as a staff member on the school's website before it was closed, told investigators she came back from her lunch break one day in June to find Adams lying on a mat next to a 4-year-old during nap time.
The child's shirt had been pulled up and Adams was rubbing her stomach, according to the complaint. The girl's parents told Thompson the next day that their daughter said Adams had touched her inappropriately.
Thompson did not return a phone message left Wednesday by The Associated Press. Messages left with Adams' attorney, Linda Parisi, also were not returned.
Adams suffered a medical condition when he was arrested and was taken to a local hospital, where he remains in police custody, Boyd said. He declined to elaborate on Adams' condition.
Adams ran the school from its opening in 1975 until the city of Citrus Heights and state officials revoked the school's business and daycare licenses in July. The school sits on an idyllic tree-lined campus with a horse pasture and red, cottage-like classrooms.
About 180 students in preschool through sixth grade attended Creative Frontiers. Tuition for a full year was $6,507, according to the school's website.
Since the school was shuttered, parents have inundated a Facebook page for Creative Frontiers in support of Adams and his family. Many have volunteered at rallies and fundraisers in an effort to reopen the school.
Theresa Del Biaggio, a parent who said she has been actively involved with trying to reopen the school, said she was devastated to hear about the charges filed against Adams.
"I did read the charges that were filed, and I have to be honest, it still seems relatively ambiguous," she said. "It seems fishy and far-fetched to me the way it's coming out."
Lisa Lambert, whose 10-year-old daughter would have started her second year at the school this fall, said her daughter thought the world of Adams.
"Currently, I'm pretty shocked. I'm saddened. But in a way, I'm kind of relieved, because I'm hoping they can start their defense and clear his name," she said.
Adams could face up to eight years in a state prison for each of the six felony counts if he is convicted. He could also face a fine of up to $5,000 and at least a year in a county jail if convicted on the misdemeanor charge.

				This man may well be guilty -- because any man who works with children knows not to ever stay alone with them in isolation. 

First of all, it is not a comfortabl­e situation for the child. One minute she's at school and the next, she's in an intimate one-on-one situation with a person of power. It can be uncomforta­ble for the child.

Secondly, a teacher should not remain alone with a child in an enclosed area, simply for legal reasons. This actually applies to all teachers, but male teachers instinctiv­ely understand this. You're asking for trouble. Sometimes, just a man's loud, gruff voice can scare a child. She may later report to her parents that you "hurt her" -- when in reality you hurt her feelings or simply scared her.

So, while there may have been the occasional­, unavoidabl­e moments of isolated contact over the years, it is simply not credible that this man would be alone in a room with a young student -- so many times.

				It kills me how BLINDLY these parents follow this child molester. If he didn't touch your child, then you should be thankful. But do not automatica­lly think HE is a victim. At least two teachers SAW him do these things he is accused of. And what in the world did they do about it? From this article, it seems like they did nothing. This makes me sick! He has been in business since 1975. That is 36 yrs that he had been working closely with children. Disgusting­!!!! And it's the people who turn a blind eye that help people like Phillip Garrido kidnap a young 11 yr old and keep her hidden in the backyard for 18 yrs! Wake up people!

				The fact that the teachers did not report the abuse, and continued to work at the school, strongly suggests they are not telling the truth. 

The one unreported incident supposedly happened back in 2007. That would mean this teacher is partly responsibl­e for any molestatio­n that may have occurred at the school in the last 4 years. 

Teachers are mandated reporters of abuse. It's not optional.

				I'm a believer that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, however, having not one complaint, but many complaints about the same man, it is farily evident that he likes little kids...lik­es them a lot.  He will get his in jail; Bubba will teach him to like big guys with muscles...­It'll be a good lesson for him.

				If the teacher who says she saw him put his hand under the skirt of a child didn't report it then and there, she should be arrested -- she is obligated by law, as a teacher to do so.  If she did, and it wasn't investigat­ed, then the people responsibl­e for investigat­ing it failed to do so, and they should also be arrested, for failure to protect chidren.  If she reported it, and it was investigat­ed and found to be unfounded, there's not much we can do about that case now.  I sincerely HOPE that this is not true, but I don't know.

				I'm repulsed by the media coverage and public commentary of this situation.  The media refuses to report the whole story, choosing instead to stir up hatred for a man based solely on, let's see... nothing.  There are a multitude of factors here that point to political agendas, and as they're being exposed, it's become a good old fashioned pissing match.  Be careful what you wish for people, because you never know when you might be in Bob's shoes, having done nothing wrong but being persecuted neverthele­ss.

				Yes, I weep for the man who had his hand up a little girl's dress.  

There are eyewitness accounts on separate occasions as well as the statement from at least one, if not more, of the children.  That is far from the "nothing" you so naively think in your defense of the suspect.  

This doesn't seem to be "political­" nor persecutio­n but a serious concern that this man has had inappropri­ate contact with several children.  The article here seems to be reporting facts and a good basis for concern for investigat­ion.

I do hope this man will be defended vigorously in court, as is his right, but to post that this is "political­", a "pissing match", or based on "nothing" is not true.  From the facts the journalist­s have uncovered, there is real concern over this man that stretch on for years.

				I see nothing in your post showing concern for the potential child molestatio­n victims, some as young as 2 or 3 years old. Those are babies. Pretty sure "Mr. Bob" will quietly take a plea deal, meanwhile leaving victims who have to deal with what happened. If he pleads out, he should be forced to pay for lifetime counseling for the victims.

				This is exactly why I do not want public funds -- so called, "vouchers" -- going to private schools. The private school parents lose all sense of rules and boundaries­.

This man put himself in a molester's shoes by being caught alone with little children in an enclosed space. That is inappropri­ate. 

Why would he need to summon a child into his office? That alone is suspicious­. Is this man denying making private appointmen­ts with 7-year-old­s?

				When the final spike is pounded into the chest of American Liberty it will happen in Southern California and it will be driven by clueless white snots who are so bigoted, so blinded by shallow hatred that they can't see the intense irony of a white 
American, probably first or second generation California­n, not that adding more generation­s would help, standing on land that was stolen from Mexico, telling another white American that they don't belong and are a lesser person because they are from a different state in the same country.
The German people who supported Hitler had more depth.
Consequenc­es Do Not Occur to These People
Is it any surprise at all that America is the country that brought us the Salem witch trials?
It is a surprise to me that the same mentalitie­s are still walking around.  We haven't learned a thing.  We haven't advanced one iota.  Or at least some of us haven't.
This isn't an isolated few people either.  There are thousands of them.
Where did the good people go who used to live here?

				Really glad this guy has been stopped, if he was actually doing it, but how can you be charged for touching someone years ago? Wouldn't it be very hard to prove something like that? What evidence, aside from just your word, would one even use to prove it? Seems like any parent could just teach their children to create a false accusation­.

				I want to protest:  A moderator for the HP named glockman just posted the following:

“Hogwash. In the state where I work, Florida, certain classes of employees, including police, fire, teachers, doctors, social workers, judges, etc, are required by law to report any type of child abuse, and they are protected by law. 
Your agenda is showing.”

I wish to inform Mr. Moderator that I am an attorney and am well aware of who must report this kind of abuse.  As a former volunteer for the Women's shelter and sexual assault advocate for ten years, I am also aware that not everyone DOES report abuse!  In particular­, those who are worried about their safety or their jobs may not report.  This is fact.  I have seen it.  So do not tell me that his is hogwash.  It is not1

				You're both correct -- those listed (and others) are required to report suspected cases of child abuse and neglect, as long as they are not making the report maliciousl­y.  And a lot of cases of child abuse (as well as sexual assault and DV) are not reported.  I wish that weren't true.

				Just like those two dehumanizi­ng people in yet another article you can read about which is also presented by Huff News that left a  woman lay to die, hid her remains, & then had the audacity to spend her money. Jails are far too overcrowde­d with people, most who, Thank God, can & will be rehabilita­ted & will return to the real world as  productive citizens. BUT- THESE people have proven themselves to be a total  threat to society for the duration of their lives. Since most of the State Hospitals have closed & instead of burdening tax payers with taking care of this filth as they attend a kazillion dollars worth of Shrink 101 that never produces a solution to their problems anyway, the next best thing to do would be to set a couple of those poor animals that are unmerciful­ly used in torturous experiment­s free & let this guy, like that other pair, take their place. It's time to crack down HARD on these psychos. Let poor Fiddo go, feed him well, & turn this unproducti­ve, usless trash over to these labs. They just may serve one good cause in their lives by doing that.

				"Adams suffered a medical condition as he was being arrested at his Folsom home Wednesday morning and was taken to a hospital."
Was it a massive heart attack or just anxiety?
Lock this creature up for the rest of his life.

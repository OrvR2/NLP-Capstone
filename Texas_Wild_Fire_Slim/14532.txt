Happy Birthday Joseph
March 10, 2010By Allen HebertJoseph Anthony Celebrates his First Birthday today

Our little boy turns one year old today.  I can’t believe that it has already been a year since he was born and since I was a single parent while Denae was in the hospital for over a month.  It has been a busy year, but filled with much joy and peace.  Now the tough part begins, we now begin to have many years of “last times”.  This will be the last time we will have two kids in diapers (and in another 2 years, hopefully the last one in diapers), the last time we get really excited about one of our own kid’s first steps, etc.

So we will enjoy these precious events with even greater appreciation because it will be our last rodeo.  Change is the only constant in life and so bring on the change and Lord give us the strength to finish the race strong.
God Bless,

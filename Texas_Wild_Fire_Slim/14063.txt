Michelle: Heath's Death Changed Me
But three years later, life has 'repaired itself'

(Newser) -
                                    When Heath Ledger died, "it felt like we didn’t have anything," Michelle Williams recalls in a new  Vogue  cover story.

Anderson Gets Spray Tanned With Snooki
Yes, viewers at home, he does take off his shirt

(Newser) -
                                    Anderson Cooper, who has  braved angry mobs  in Egypt,  faced potential radiation poisoning  in Japan, and  rescued a bloodied child  in Haiti, shows a decidedly less hard-hitting side on his  new daytime show . Case in point: On the second episode of Anderson yesterday, Coop went for a spray tan with—...

Apparently, a lot of people live streamed the royal wedding

(Newser) -
                                    The Guinness Book of World Records is not just for regular joes who go on epic  bar crawls  or  paddleboard rides . No, it's also for celebrities—and according to  Perez Hilton ,  Gossip Cop , and  MTV , a whole slew of them made their way in to the 2012 edition:   Lady ...

Gaga Flashes Photogs ... Er, What Was That?
Gawker stumped

(Newser) -
                                    The great Gaga  mystery continues . The too-much singer flashed photogs when her slitted dress slitted a bit too much, gushes the  New York Daily News , which spotted a piercing on the underwear-less Gaga. But  Gawker  was left wondering what exactly that was between Gaga's legs. The News blurred the...

Bananas and ketchup ... yum?

                                    More proof celebrities are just like us: They get weird pregnancy food cravings, too. The  Sun  reports that Beyonce is already hankering for some pretty weird combinations, which, perhaps too predictably, include pickles. "She's snacking on Oreo biscuits and gherkins," says a source. Also, "Bounty ice...

Madonna Bursts Into Song, Gives Critics Instructions
And calls King Edward VIII 'very punk rock'

(Newser) -
                                    Madonna doesn’t mind criticism of her new movie, WE—a good thing,  since it bombed  at the Venice Film Festival and,  Reuters  notes, subsequently received a one-star review in the Guardian—as long as that criticism is directed at the movie, and not at the Material Girl. "I...

Madonna Posts Cheeky Video Ode to Hydrangeas
Material Girl responds to flower brouhaha

(Newser) -
                                    Nope, Madonna still doesn’t like hydrangeas, a fact she makes abundantly clear in a new video posted on her official  YouTube  channel. Though titled "Madonna’s love letter to hydrangeas"—and beginning with an apparent apology to the flower  she dissed last week —the video quickly...

(Newser) -
                                    Eighteen months after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Spartacus TV star Andy Whitfield has died. He was 39. Spartacus: Blood and Sand was the Starz network's first big hit, thanks in large part to the program's plentiful violence and nudity.

                                    Ricky Gervais won't shut up. Bashed after hosting the last Golden Globe Awards show for his  inappropriate comments  (which should have come as no surprise to anyone), the irreverent comedian is considering being an underground podcast host next time around. That's the gist of his latest blogs as...

Alec Baldwin Bashes Lowly Starbucks Barista
...who may not exist

(Newser) -
                                    Alec Baldwin is not a man known for his cool temper, which makes it only slightly surprising that he went on a Twitter rant on Wednesday. The weird twist? It was directed at a possibly non-existent Starbucks employee. "Starbucks on 93 and B’way. Uptight Queen barrista [sic] named...

                                    In case you missed it, the  Huffington Post  has a recap of Oprah Winfrey’s  Facebook live chat  yesterday—and, according to HuffPo, it was “nothing short of incredible.” Highlights:   On fear: The talk show queen didn’t understand the meaning of the word until late 2010, when ...

He's producing story of Judah Maccabee

(Newser) -
                                    Five years after Mel Gibson derailed his career with a DUI arrest and infamous anti-Semitic rant, the actor's attempt at returning to the Hollywood pantheon has taken a rather ironic turn: Gibson will produce a movie about one of the greatest Jewish warriors of all time, Judah Maccabee, reports...

                                    Ahh, Gwyneth Paltrow: It seems every time she does something relatable, she immediately  goes  and  ruins  it. But could she, finally, be on the road to a permanently less  pretentious  image? The promo posters for her new movie Contagion, out tomorrow, seem to indicate the answer is yes. While everyone...

                                    He managed to escape  the six months in jail  he was facing, but John Galliano didn't manage to escape a guilty verdict.

An extreme drought may not be the only problem facing residents of Texas this summer. KXAN in Austin reports that firefighters responded to a brush fire last month that started on its own.
The fire, which ignited in a compost or mulch pile, was blamed on spontaneous combustion. Austin Fire Lieutenant Jim Baker told KXAN that decomposition in compost piles creates heat. He explained that in the summer heat, "everything is dry and it's not uncommon for mulch piles to spontaneously ignite."
In the video, Jill Lavigne, a worker at a local nursery, recommends watering compost piles if it doesn't rain, or splitting them into smaller piles. Firefighters also suggest residents pay attention to the vegetation around compost piles and cut it short to keep fires from spreading.
As of Tuesday morning, a wildfire in Central Texas has already destroyed almost 500 homes, according to the Associated Press. Governor Rick Perry said there are over 50 wildfires burning across the state. 
Texas is currently facing its worst drought since the 1950s, and several towns are nearly out of water.

				with the possibilit­y of spontaneou­s combustion­, the arson investigat­ors can at least quit spending time rounding up all the homeless and searching them for matchbooks and lighters.  we should outlaw mulch piles and brush, to cut down on wildfires.  if towns are out of water, the last thing residents are going to use spare water for is watering down compost piles.

				Don't know if this is correct, but just saw a news item claiming 21,000 wildfires started in Texas since last December.  In any event, a question remains as to what is starting all these.  I understand that conditions are "dry" and that provides ready fuel, but some source of ignition is still needed.  California­, for example, has and has long had tinder dry conditions all summer long due to a Mediterran­ean Climate that often produces no more than a few hundreths of an inch of rain for as long a five months including summer.  But "spontaneo­us combustion­" does not break out all over the state of California­.  Something must ignite tinder for it to burn.  What is the source of ignition in all these Texas fires?   Just curious?

				How does one distinguis­h between 'spontaneo­us combustion­' and a message from God?  

Perry and the other conservati­ve candidates apparently hear God telling them to run for President, to cut taxes, to slash spending on the needy, to eliminate regulation­s to limit pollution, to deny global climate change.  But why don't they ask themselves if fire, drought, earthquake­, flood, hurricanes­, and tornadoes are perhaps a message from the Almighty telling them something different?

				If Texas would just give back all the stimulus money they took, I think the rest of the country could do without them quite nicely.

The oil they drill goes to the highest bidder worldwide, and the 'trickle down' effect on American gas prices is minimal.  The jobs they've created are mostly minimum wage.  In terms of education and literacy, they rank down with the third world countries.  Without the rest of the US, they would be no different than Mexico--we­alth in the hands of  a few, poverty controllin­g the lives of the rest.

Back to School: Online Sales Tax and AmazonBy Kelly Phillips Erb | Forbes – 10 hrs ago




Related ContentBack to School: Online Sales Tax and Amazon

My oldest daughter is an over-achiever. Point in fact: she was doing her book report this morning (it's due September 19) even though she doesn't have the book yet. She was coming up with a concept, you know, just so that she'd be ready.
The missing book was quite the point of contention. It wasn't readily available in the local bookstore in hurricane-plagued western Maine (sounds weird, doesn't it?) so we didn't have it on the first day of school. So I did what any mom with a computer would do: I went looking for it online. I eventually found it - not without incident - and purchased it at Barnes and Noble. I tweeted about my experience. Not surprisingly, the conversation turned quickly to online sales tax with @taxconsulting asking:

My answer:

 
You see, it's clear to me that Barnes and Noble has nexus in Pennsylvania (where I live). Nexus is the legal term for connection; this is important in the tax world because states must establish a connection between a taxpayer and the state in order to impose taxes. That used to be an easy test: are you located in the state or not? The introduction of direct mail catalogs changed the way that retailers and revenue agents viewed nexus. And now, online sales are challenging it even more.
It's funny. My kids have never known a world without online sales. Even for back to school, we ordered books, book bags and school uniforms over the internet. Yet, despite that online shopping feels like an ordinary, every day event, the rules regarding sales tax are still evolving. In the grand scheme of retail, online sales are still relatively new. Don't believe me? Consider this: Amazon.com and eBay.com are both younger than 20 years old.
It's no wonder, then, that retailers and consumers alike are confused about the rules. In most states that impose a sales tax (only five states don't impose sales tax: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon), retailers that establish nexus must charge sales tax to customers in that state. When sales tax is not imposed on a taxable item, most states require that the consumer/taxpayer file a return and pay a use tax.
Realistically, most consumers don't file a return or pay a use tax. There are a lot of reasons which range from apathy to ignorance of the rules to full on defiance. As online sales increase - and escape tax if the retailer isn't collecting the tax - states are concerned about the resulting tax gap (the difference between what should be collected and is collected).
You can imagine that it's a tricky debate. States have a few options, none of which are terribly palatable. They can:

 increase compliance for consumers (political suicide)
 ditch the tax altogether (potential fiscal ruin)
 chase companies for collections (public relations nightmare); or
 secede in order not to have to worry about that pesky Constitution.

While I'm certain that there are some states that we might not miss having around (cough, cough), realistically, I think our 50 states are pretty much set so option #4 is out. State economies are bleeding so option #2 would be a hard sell since we all know the result would be bumps in existing taxes rather than spending cuts to make up the difference.
That leaves options #1 and #3.
Most states are chasing option #3 while retailers are pulling for option #1; they can characterize their efforts however they wish, they're really asking states to put the burden on the consumer.

And retailers are turning up the pressure. As more and more states choose option #3, some retail giants are firing back. Most notably, in response to California's efforts to collect sales tax on online sales, Amazon.com has promised to hire 7,000 more people in the state in exchange for a moratorium on collections. With a 12% jobless rate in the state, that's a deal that's going to be difficult to pass up. To further sweeten the pot, Amazon promised to drop its efforts to repeal the tax.
As Amazon pushes harder, the chatter around the notion of taxing online sales (and the possibility of a national sales tax) has increased. And more than once, the debate has focused on the concept of what is "fair" when it comes to online sales. My take is that our definition of transactions subject to tax will need to be expanded while remaining mindful of constitutional concerns about due process and interstate commerce.
While states continue to sort this out, you'll want to be aware of the laws in your state. If your state charges a sales and use tax and if the retailer you choose for your textbooks, clothes and other back to school  items doesn't charge sales tax on a taxable item, you may be responsible for use tax. Keep in mind that not all purchases are taxable (for example, clothing is exempt from sales tax in Pennsylvania) so check with your state's Department of Revenue or your own tax professional if you have any questions.

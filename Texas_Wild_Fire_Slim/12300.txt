Basin Complex PM Wind Shift June 30
Comments Off






I’ve seen no better satellite image loop with a close up view than this image from RAMSDIS.The winds shifted mid-day and as you can see by the image and animated loop the smoke columns for the Basin Complex, Indians Fire and the Piute Fire across the Central Valley in Kern County moved approximately 60 degrees in the matter of an hour.
*Blogger being a bit buggy at the moment so I can’t upload the image. I’ll try later.

Big Sur Fire: Historic Event In The Making
Comments Off






The fire is very active today as we see from the most recent map from GeoMAC. It appears the fire will merge with the Indians Fire as predicted here last week. Take a look at the spot fires (indicated as red dots) in the map below.Note too how the Indians Fire has blown containment on the N/E.
This is a beautiful forest and is very sad to witness. I believe both fire managers are doing everything in their power to bring these conflagrations under control. Sadly they don’t have the resources to confront it properly. Two thousand firefighters is about 1/4 of the manpower they need to make a dent.The morning report indicates 40,000 acres with 3% contained for the Basin Complex Fire. The Indians Fire says 61,000 acres with 89% containment. I believe that containment figure will be revised downward.

Big Sur Fire Causes Concern for Condor Keepers
Comments Off






Biologists are working around the smoke and flames in Big Sur keeping watch on the small California Condor population inhabiting the Ventana Wilderness. The Ventana Wilderness Society, the only non profit organization releasing condors in California, is monitoring the flock that call Big Sur home. The group thinks one female condor has been lost to the fire. I support the group’s work on behalf of these remarkable birds.
If you have a moment take a look at these short videos. You can see why these magnificent birds attract such concern.

 Click the image to enlarge or visit MODIS Rapidfire for an expanded view of this remarkable enhanced satellite image of the California fires. The fire in the lower right portion of the image is the Piute Fire, a new fire burning in Kern County. 
For perspective I added an image of fires burning out of control in Russia. Not such a fuss is made of forest fires in Siberia.

Big Sur Fire; Basins Complex View June 29,2008
Comments Off






Basins Complex Fire commanders got some “fresh” troops yesterday upping their reported total to just over 1,000. The morning report shows 32,000 acres have burned with containment still under 5%. You can see from the map below the fire is spreading east and north. The fire’s march south has not halted even though the GeoMAC image shows there is not active burning on the southern head.
Keep in mind 1,000 firefighters on scene means one half are on the lines and the other half are getting sleep. The fire only has 17 hand crews and 11 bulldozers assigned. Of the 1,000 firefighters nearly 20 percent are designated “overhead”. These are division and group supervisors, incident command team members, biologists etc..
While they support efforts of the actual firefighters they do not lay shovels to the ground. Fifty or so firefighters comprise the two in-camp kitchen crews and their supervisors. Forty four fire engines are assigned to the Basins Complex and are primarily used for structure protection according the incident report. Structure protection engines and crews prep individual properties and lay in wait for the fire to come to them.
In reality no more than a few hundred firefighters and the eleven dozer operators are on the ground on any one shift. From the sky seven helicopters and seven fixed wing craft pound the flanks and support the hand crews working below. It’s a decent air force but they cannot put the fire out without adequate ground support.
All considered this is a very small army for a fire this size. Fire command is really doing all they can with what they are given. Save structures, try to guide the fire away from local communities and hope for helping weather. Troops are scarce statewide so it’s improbable this one will ever get adequately staffed. If so we’ll likely see 170,000 acres burned as noted by Basin Complex command staff yesterday.
GeoMAC fire mapping software is fantastic. If you haven’t played around with the fire map viewing options you should have a look.
*Update: Basins Complex continues run to the northwest—–

Big Sur's Basin Complex a Three Headed Monster
1 comment






The latest GeoMAC image captured at 1:00pm today shows the fire spotting off the south flank of the Basin Complex Fire. We know from the morning ICS-209 that Incident Commander Dietrich is not keen on putting firefighters inside the perimeter for the most part. There is not much to be gained and very much to be lost by placing his limited resources out in front this beast. As it stands his fire and the Indians Fire are destined to merge. No one needs to get hurt trying to stop it.

 Top image from early morning June 28, image below mid day June, 28.

If you look at the path the Basins Complex is taking you can make a case the south flank could run to Nacimiento-Fergusson Road. In this case firefighters could then tie the Basin Complex to the burned areas of the Indians to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west.
The north flank of the fire should be helped by prevailing N/W winds once they return. The eastern head of the Basin Complex looks like the headache for fire command.
The morning report projected the final size at 170,000 acres. Most of this acreage has to come from acreage gained on its journey east. In order to get to 170,000 acres you have to look out as far as the lower Carmel Valley. 
It seems almost inconceivable at the moment to suggest the fire will travel that far but I can’t see how else they can get to 170K acres. Residents of lower Carmel Valley will get early clues if they begin seeing bulldozers unloading on the Valley floor to begin constructing or fortifying trails along the first line of ridges running the length of lower Carmel Valley. 
These are only my back of the napkin thoughts. For a formal narrative read Sur Coast updates.

Officials: Big Sur Fires May Exceed 250,000 Acres
Comments Off






The Indians Fire and Basin Complex Fire currently burning in the Ventana Wilderness will likely combine to become the the largest fire in modern California state history.
This morning’s ICS-209 report for the Basin Complex Fire, now called Basin Complex West includes an estimated final size at 170,000 acres. The Basin Complex West fire will come close to matching the Marble-Cone Fire of 1977 that consumed 178,000 acres on the same ground.
The Indians Fire management team has stated since the start of the fire in May they expect their fire to exceed 80,000 acres. The fire has burned over 60,000 acres so far.
Wikipedia maintains a list of the largest wildfires in California history as;
1 – Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889: 300,000 acres ·2 – Cedar Fire: 273,246 acres3 – Zaca Fire: 240,207 acres4 – Matilija Fire: 220,000 acres5 – Witch Fire: 197,9906 – Laguna Fire: 175,425 acres7 – Marble-Cone Fire: ~178,000 acres8 – Day Fire: 162,700 acres9 – McNally Fire: 150,670 acres10 – Old Fire: 91,281 acres11 – Harris Fire: 90,440 acres (366 km²)
If the Basin Complex West and Indians Fire meet the stated expectations the combined acreage could challenge the Cedar Fire of 273k acres. Worth noting both current fire managers were in command of the Zaca Fire (#3 all time) at various stages last year.

State Burns; Business as Usual on Indians Fire
1 comment






Indians Fire (60,000 acres 71% contained) management (joint, headed by CIIMT2 (Molumby, IC) bucked convention and conducted a firing operation on the north side of the fire. You can see in the image below (indicated in red) where they burned today.The Indians Fire ICS-209 report filed tonight indicates the firing operation was carried out in the face of 16 mph winds from the east, towards the Basin Fire less than three miles downwind.
I’ve followed this fire more closely than others burning in the state because it is close to my place and I sensed early on this fire could be a candidate for mismanagement. The $36,000,000 price tag to date and hoarding of personnel, when others begged for resources has not altered my suspicions. Maybe they don’t realize how close they are to the Basin Complex? It almost appears as though they were persuading their fire to move east.
If this is their long range plan then it means they intend for the two fires to merge. The Basin Fire (26,000 acres 3% contained) hints so in their June 27 pm  ICS-209.
Remarks:“Plans are being implemented to zone the Basin Complex  with Indians Fire command team. Damage assessment continues. Containment value  remains static due to defensive actions. The Basin Complex is in unified command  with USFS, Big Sur Volunteer Fire Brigade and Monterey County Sheriff’s Office.  “If the fires meet in the middle on their own I have no problem. If the fires are being directed to meet I suggest the forest is a victim of mismanagement.
The Molumby crew has been consistent from the beginning his fire would be an 80,000 plus acre event. He’ll be dead on if he pushes his fire into the Basin Fire. Dead on for his Indians Fire contribution. A combined Basin/Indians perimeter could easily combine to take out 125,000 acres.The Ventana Wilderness deserves better than this..

Redding at Geographic Center of California Firestorm
Comments Off






The Record Searchlight Online is providing first rate information on the fires affecting the forests and communities in the north state. Redding is a hub where arriving firefighters from all points enter before branching out to their assignments.
A partial list of major fires and clusters, (complex) surrounding Redding include The Lime Complex, Iron Complex, Hell’s Half Complex and the Whiskeytown Complex burn west of Redding. The SHU Lightning Complex burns north of the city, while the Cub Complex, Antelope and Mill Fires burn the the east.
The editorial staff of the Record Searchlight has been kind enough to recognize firefighters with a firefighter thank you page. If you have a moment click over and leave a message.

Air National Guard MAFFS C-130's To The Fires
Comments Off






 Military sends four National Guard MAFFS C-130′s!
“The aircraft are a part of the North Carolina Air National Guard’s 145th Airlift Wing based at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport.
The aircraft with nearly 50 North Carolina guardmembers are conducting airborne firefighting missions from a staging area near Sacramento, Calif. Two C-130s carry modular airborne fire fighting systems (MAFFS).
Since 1974, MAFFS has saved land, lives and property from wild land fires in the United States and abroad. MAFFS is only activated when all other air tanker resources are committed.
The MAFFS mission equips C-130s with a firefighting apparatus that is loaded into the aircraft’s cargo area. The MAFFS unit itself is a series of pressurized tanks that hold 3,000 gallons of flame-retardant liquid.
Directed by ground crews, and led to the fire site by a U.S. Forest service lead plane, MAFFS aircraft drop retardant along the leading edge of a fire to block the spread of flames.
The North Carolina contingent is operating two C-130s equipped with MAFFS modules. Two other C-130s are transporting equipment and personnel.”

California Fires; Weather Spanking Underway
3 comments






Yesterday I posted a satellite image showing smoke covering half the state.The inversion is about to lift. The satellite image below shows smoke from the north state blowing west, out to sea. This S/W wind is will lift the inversion and give fires new breath.

NOAA animated loop 
If you look at the predicted weather today for the Walker Fire near Clear Lake you see winds from the ESE at 11:00am turning to WSW by 3:00pm.
This is where firefighters will find the most danger, (reference Firefighters Watchout Situations #15 below) once the front moves in. Later in the evening lightning is forecast. Expect little relief from any precipitation, expect new fires will result from dry lightning.
——————————————————————————–
Standard Firefighting Orders1. Keep informed on fire weather conditions and forecasts.2. Know what your fire is doing at all times.3. Base all actions on current and expected behavior of the fire.4. Identify escape routes and safety zones and make them known.5. Post lookouts when there is possible danger.6. Be alert. Keep calm. Think clearly. Act decisively.7. Maintain prompt communications with your forces,supervisor,and adjoining forces.8. Give clear instructions and insure they are understood.9. Maintain control of your forces at all times.10. Fight fire aggressively, having provided for safety first.
18 Watchouts Situations
1. Fire not scouted and sized up.2. In country not seen in daylight.3. Safety zones and escape routes not identified.4. Unfamiliar with weather and local factors influencing fire behavior.5. Uninformed on strategy, tactics, and hazards.6. Instructions and assignments not clear.7. No communication link with crewmembers/supervisors.8. Constructing line without safe anchor point.9. Building fireline downhill with fire below.10. Attempting frontal assault on fire.11. Unburned fuel between you and the fire.12. Cannot see main fire, not in contact with anyone who can.13. On a hillside where rolling material can ignite fuel below.14. Weather is getting hotter and drier.15. Wind increases and/or changes direction.16. Getting frequent spot fires across line.17. Terrain and fuels make escape to safety zones difficult.18. Taking a nap near the fire line.

Basin Complex Looking Like Marble-Cone Fire #2
7 comments






Big Sur locals including Big Sur Fire Brigade Chief Frank Penny and Los Padres National Forest “fuel chief” Steve Davis expressed prophetic concerns in an interview with a local reporter in October 2006;Chief Penny saw this coming;
““The area is screaming for more proactive prevention,” he says. “It’s very easy to do it, it’s just the will. There is a need for supplemental funding because of sudden oak {death}.“It’s a crisis now. It just hasn’t become a political crisis because nobody’s been killed, nobody’s house has burned up, no roads have washed out.”
In 1977 90% of the Ventana Wilderness was scorched by the 178,000 acre Marble-Cone Fire.
Marble Cone was fed by dead limbs from unusual snow fall seasons before. The Basin Complex Fire is fed by “sudden oak death”, a plague decimating tan oaks in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties. An example of sudden oak death can be seen in a webcam photo capture from the Big Sur webcam at Nepenthe Restaurant. Notice the dead tree in the center of the image.
 The Marble-Cone Fire may have been fueled by dead limbs but the fire was actually surrounded by responding state and federal crews in the initial stages. My cousin was one of those firefighters who had the fire in check when they were ordered to put down their chain saws. An approaching bulldozer was stopped in its tracks. The fire was in a “Wilderness” and no mechanical equipment is allowed in a designated wilderness. 
I’ll never forget my cousin shaking his head when he first told me this story. They had it stopped at 100 acres. 
I’m not sure if an exemption was asked for or granted for this incident but you have to hope it was. As it stands tonight the fire is at 26,000 acres, 97% of which is uncontained fire line with multiple heads. The Ventana Wilderness is a precious resource. 
The prophetic words of Chief Penny are coming back to haunt. The Angora Fire at Lake Tahoe last summer was fed by downed and dead trees. A debate continues who was at fault for not allowing clearing the deadwood. Two hundred fifty homes were lost there. Sixteen homes have been lost so far in Big Sur. One resident was told by a fire official the “big box” estimate for the Basin Complex is 250,000 acres.

Text from NASA’s MODIS Rapidfire team.
“A heat wave and windy weather plagued firefighters in California in mid-June 2008 as they worked to contain hundreds of fires across the state. Many of the fires were triggered by lightning on Friday, June 20. This natural-color image from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite on Monday, June 23, shows places where the sensor detected actively burning fires (red outlines). Fires appear most numerous in Northern California. The Northern region of California has experienced record low levels of rainfall this spring, leaving dry vegetation in the area. This in conjunction with windy weather has made firefighting efforts difficult.”

Big Sur Fires: Indians Fire and Gallery Fires Closer to Merging
Comments Off






 It appears inevitable the Gallery Fire, now known as the Basin Complex will merge with the Indians Fire.
The Indians Fire has burned 58,000 acres and is at 71% containment. The fire has been burning since June 8. Two thousand firefighters are assigned to the Indians Fire.
By comparison 580 firefighters are assigned to the 13,500 acre Basin Complex. Indians Fire command is sharing some resources and, “preparing to assist the Basin Complex with strategic planning and implementation as the need arises“.
KSBW TV Salinas reports tonight that new evacuations have been ordered.
They report;
“Mandatory evacuation notices were issued late Tuesday afternoon for residents in the Arroyo Seco area as the Indians Fire continued to move north toward homes. Residents on Arroyo Seco Road from Carmel Valley Road to the Arroyo Seco Campgrounds have been ordered to evacuate the area.”
This supports evidence seen on the map above that the Indians Fire is still far from full containment. The map below points to Tassajara Hot Springs, directly between the Basin Complex and Indians Fire.The combined fires could easily total 125,000 acres or more.Sixteen homes have been consumed by the Gallery Fire/Basin Complex. Two homes and fourteen outbuildings have been destroyed by the Indians Fire.

Focus Fire; Oliver Complex, Oakhurst California
Comments Off






A skeleton force of 359 firefighters are assigned to the Oliver Complex Fires comprised of the following named fires.
Directly from the Incident 209 report;
OLIVER Fire 1000 ACRES 0% CONTAINEDWESTFALL Fire 50 ACRES 50%,SILVER Fire 400 10%,STAR Fire 30 ACRES 0%,CHIQUITO Fire 10 ACRES 50%,GAGG, POISON, AND 7 OTHERS FIRES ARE CONFINED NOT YET CONTROLLED.
Growth Potential – ExtremeDifficulty of Terrain – Extreme
Values at Risk: include communities, critical infrastructure, natural and cultural resources in 12, 24, 48 and 72 hour time frames:12 hours:PONDEROSA SUBDIVISION WITH 100+ HOMES. RECREATIONAL CABINS IN THE FOREST NUMBER IN THE 100′S. WITHIN 72 HOURS WAWONA AND THE BIG TREES (SEQUOIA GIGANTEA) IN YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK WILL BE THREATENED BY THE STAR INCIDENT (ONE OF 14 FIRES WITHIN THIS COMPLEX). LATERAL MOVEMENT UP AND DOWN RIVER HAS GOOD POTENTIAL TO REACH NP LANDS.
CONTINUE UTULIZING AVAILABLE RESOURCES. CONTINUE REQUESTS FOR SCARCE RESOURCES
Critical Resource Needs (amount, type, kind and number of operational periods () in priority order in 12, 24, 48, and 72 hour time frames):12 hours:10 HEAVY AIRTANKERS, 4 TYPE 1 AND 6 TYPE 2 HELICOPTERS, 15 HAND CREWS.24 hours:10 HEAVY AIRTANKERS, 4 TYPE 1 AND 6 TYPE 2 HELICOPTERS, 15 HANDCREWS———————————This scenario is being played out similarly throughout central and northern California. The incident commander won’t get those 10 heavy tankers or 8 helicopters.He’ll get by with the two helicopters he has assigned along with the 13 engines and 8 bulldozers he has.
Residents upstream should be advised. If you are told to evacuate do so without hesitation. Under ordinary circumstances structure protection crews would be available to prep your house and stand guard. This is not an option from my read.

Cal Fire Crew Bus Crashes Critically Injuring Two
Comments Off






 A Cal Fire crew bus rolled over yesterday critically injuring 2 firefighters. Blogger Bob has the details and a picture of the crew and Captain. The rollover injured injured 18 total and was caused by a tire blowout.The crew was comprised of CDC inmates and a Cal Fire Captain. Local news reports the crew was returning to quarters near Temecula after responding to a 20 acre brush fire.
About Cal Fire Crew Carriers.
The California Department of Corrections released this earlier today;
June 24, 2008;FAIRFIELD – Today, 2,237 California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) inmates supervised by 180 custody staff have been deployed to battle the Wild Fire in Solano and Napa counties, and other raging wildfires statewide.
“Inmate firefighting crews and the custody staff who supervise them are a critical component of the state’s coordinated effort to battle wildfires and to respond to other emergencies,” said CDCR Secretary Matthew Cate. “Right now, a total of 156 inmate firefighter crews from 42 conservation camps are assisting the state gain control of these devastating fires scattered primarily throughout Central and Northern California.”
Since 1946, the Conservation Camp Program has provided California with a well-trained, well-equipped workforce for fire suppression. More than 4,400 male and female inmates participate in the program, which consist of approximately 200 fire crews. The crews respond nearly every type of emergency, including wildfires, floods, search and rescue operations, and earthquakes. They also log millions of hours annually on fire reduction and conservation projects and provide forest, range and watershed enhancement on public lands.
CDCR jointly manages 39 adult and juvenile camps with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and five adult camps with the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
Only minimum-custody inmates may participate in the Conservation Camp Program. They must be physically fit and have no history of a violent crime, including kidnapping, sex offenses, arson or escape. Juvenile offenders earn their way into camp placement and must be free of major rule infractions. Wards convicted of sex offenses or arson are excluded.
“The Conservation Camp Program provides an enormous benefit to offenders. They learn skills, teamwork and discipline that will serve them well when they are released from prison,” Cate added. “The citizens of California benefit by having a fully trained workforce able to respond to fires, while saving more than $80 million every year that otherwise would be paid to accomplish the same tasks.”

This NASA satellite image from MODIS Rapidfire AERONET (Fresno subset) shows the extent of the fire crisis in California. Click the image for a better view. Notice the fires in the Sierra’s and Sierra foothills are burning north while fires along the north and central coast are running south. Coastal fog is no help.An animated satellite view of current wind patterns in California can be viewed here.

Big Sur Fire; Gallery and Basin Fires Merge
1 comment






The Gallery Fire burning in Big Sur is considered part of the Basin Complex. Fire management is slow to update so an acreage number is only a guess. However we see from GeoMAC (below) the Gallery Fire and Basin Fire have joined. Prevailing N/W winds may push the “Basin Complex” fires into the as yet contained 60,000 acre Indians Fire.
*UPDATE: ICS-209 filed 1800hrs. The Logwood Fire has been consumed by the Gallery Fire. The Complex now has two fires. The Gallery fire is 5920 acres with 10% containment. The Basin fire is 1105 acres with 0% containment. Possible 5 structures/outbuildings damaged in last 24hrs. Confirmation is an ongoing effort.Size/Area Involved 7,015 ACRES, % Contained; 3 Percent.Structures, heavy fuel loads due to sudden oak death, threat to community of Big Sur and Carmen watershed basin.
Here is what stands out as the largest issue on this incident. There are ONLY 380 fire personnel assigned to this fire. Personnel include 190 Forest Service and 65 Cal Fire professionals. Equipment is sparse with 18 fire engines, 4 water tenders and 5 bulldozers.Seventy of the fire personnel are overhead so effectively there are 150 firefighters per shift on the 7,000 acre of fire line.Under normal circumstances Cal Fire would have 1,500 people swarming this fire.Three helicopters and seven fixed wing aircraft are assigned and it is safe to say any substantial movement to suppress these fires will come from the air and the dozers working with firing crews.Bottom line, this one will need cooperative weather.

Perplexing puzzle: Can Yahoo's luster be restored?By MICHAEL LIEDTKE - AP Technology Writer | AP – 7 hrs ago





SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Yahoo Inc. has gone through three different CEOs in five years. Whoever takes the helm now will face the same challenge: Solve one of the Internet's most perplexing puzzles.Why is a company that owns some of the world's most widely used online services unable to gain traction among Web surfers, advertisers and investors? Can the company that rode the Internet boom ever again be where the cool kids go?Unless Yahoo's next regime can figure it out, the company is in danger of becoming an Internet anachronism that might have to be broken up to be salvaged.The challenge confounded Silicon Valley veteran Carol Bartz, who spent more than 2 1/2 years retooling Yahoo before being fired over the phone late Tuesday. It also befuddled Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock, who embraced Bartz as the "exact combination" of experience and savvy the company needed when she was hired in January 2009.As a stopgap measure, Yahoo appointed its chief financial officer, Tim Morse, to be interim leader until the company's board can hire a permanent replacement. Morse, 42, met with Yahoo's employees at the company's Sunnyvale, Calif., headquarters Wednesday.The board hasn't set a timetable for finding the next CEO. The directors took two months to hire Bartz after co-founder Jerry Yang decided he wanted to end a 1 1/2 year-stint as CEO in 2008.Yahoo rode the Internet boom of the 1990s and weathered the dot-com bust that followed. In the past decade, says Forrester Research analyst Shar VanBoskirk, the company has spent too much time clinging to its early success in the 1990s, instead of adapting to the trends that have reshaped the Internet.Two companies that helped drive the changes, Internet search leader Google Inc. and social network Facebook, are now the places where the cool kids hang out and, more importantly to investors, where advertisers increasingly spend their money."Yahoo has become a business stuck in its glory days," VanBoskirk says. "They became so focused on what they used to be that they can't seem to focus on what they should become. They just keep refining all the stuff that they have been doing since the 1990s."Those legacy services can still draw a crowd. Yahoo's email as well as sections devoted to general news, sports, finance and entertainment attract the most online U.S. traffic in each of their categories, according to the most recent data from the research firm comScore Inc.But the people using those services aren't sticking around as long as they once did, a pattern that has caused advertisers to seek marketing alternatives. That in turn has caused Yahoo's revenue to sag even as the overall Internet ad market has been growing at a rate of more than 20 percent annually.The net result: Many investors have concluded Yahoo's stock is no longer worth owning — even though the company's brand remains among the best known in the world.Between the time Bartz arrived and left, Yahoo's stock price gained just 81 cents while Google's shares surged by more than $200. Over the same period, the average time U.S. consumers spent on Yahoo's website each month fell 33 percent while the time spent on Facebook more than doubled, according to comScore.Yahoo fell so far behind Google in search-driven advertising, the Internet's most lucrative market, that Bartz joined forces with Microsoft to save money and free up engineers to work on other projects.That partnership, which calls on Yahoo to rely on Microsoft's search technology, was introduced late last year and hasn't been generating as much revenue as the companies hoped.Even more troubling: Yahoo has been weakening in its stronghold — the visual marketing campaigns known as "display advertising." Yahoo's website had been considered the best spot for display advertising for the past decade, but no more.By the end of this year, Facebook is expected to hold a nearly 18 percent share of the Internet display market in the U.S., followed by Yahoo at 13 percent and Google at 9 percent, according to the research firm eMarketer Inc.Two years ago, Yahoo commanded a 16 percent of the display ad market with Facebook at 7 percent and Google at less than 5 percent.Bartz, 63, tried to revive Yahoo by cutting costs, an effort that included shutting down or selling some services that had become a drain on the company's resources.It wasn't enough to rid Yahoo of a paralyzing identity crisis, according to analysts."We think the challenges ... are likely beyond any one person's ability to perform some magic and reinvigorate growth in the company," Wedge Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen wrote in a Wednesday research note.Pyykkonen says Yahoo's next move most likely will be to sell all or part of its stakes in two Asian investments, Yahoo Japan and the Alibaba Group.Neither Bartz nor Morse was convinced Yahoo would be better off if it sold those holdings. The board says it is undergoing a "comprehensive strategic review," but hasn't shared any details about what's under consideration.The company remains in such disarray after years of recurring reorganization that VanBoskirk is convinced an opportunistic bidder will emerge to take over Yahoo and then sell its services in pieces. Speculation that buyout firms would mount a takeover attempt surfaced several times while Bartz was CEO, too."Yahoo hasn't been able to demonstrate that it can create any value from the sum of all its parts," VanBoskirk says.Investors, for now, are just pleased the Bartz era is over. The company's shares rose 70 cents, or more than 5 percent, to close at $13.61 Wednesday.

Until Yahoo removes it's very obvious bias in reporting the news, and stops it's blatant censorship of news and comments, No they will continue to decline.

Yahoo's search engine sucks, it's full of spam.  Messenger Used to be the chat place to be, now it's full of porn bots, and yahoo did nothing about it.  No video service to rival YouTube.  They let too many components disintegrate , while thinking they were still hot because their news module gets hits.  It's not to late, but they're gonna have to spend a ton of cash to rejuvenate.

It is troubling to observe the Yahoo soap-opera that ended in Carol Bartz losing her job.  A very mediocre stock analyst flexed their muscle with stock-hold­ers, and get the CEO of a major corporation was fired. 

Most of these stock "experts" have never had a real job.  By far the most significant problem at Yahoo has been the partnershi­p with Microsoft, which, ironically, was demanded by Wall Street. Poor Microsoft is in a decade long funk, and lately, everything that the Redmond company touches stinks, kind of a Midas touch in reverse.

Now Wall Street insists Yahoo buy Hulu, but if this venture doesn't work to make Yahoo competitive with Google within a few months, the same Wall Street predators will call for the coach's head.

Why not concentrate on being the most comprehensive aggregate news source with the best navagation of the news and give each user the ability to personalize this resource by using search, organizing and archiving of news and information the way documents or email are filed on a PC. Be to news what google is to searching. Make Yahoo indespensible to students and businesses for research.

Yahoo needs to grasp a few _really obvious_ things.  Let's start with the fact I'm here reading/commenting on the news.  So why do they have only a bar above "Search Web", and now you have to go to a second screen and click on a second button to finally get "Search News"?  Not rocket science.  And why does their news search keep getting smaller and smaller, going back less and less?  I like to edit Wikipedia and their news search was once a great tool to sort by date and find the _first_ occurrence of a news story, which is usually more informative than all the AP spam.  But now it's hard to get that.  They should let you see all their news index records going back years; they should have an interface where you can sort out all the duplicate stories in one heap and pick off the LONGEST, the one they didn't chop three paragraphs off an already scanty wire story.

And they need to do more with the forums.  Not just thumbs up/down on the most popular, but with big threads with lots of responses, let people read the newest responses and rate them, and then have an option to list first the responses that got the most thumbs up _while they were new responses_, not after they were listed up by popularity.  Maybe that's not obvious, but we could obviously use a way to go back through our whole profile and look at old comments from any time easily, sort our comments from past year by thumbs up/thumbs down so we can see what worked and what didn't and so forth.

And most obvious of all --- what kind of social networking site cheerfully advertises that its features are GOING AWAY?

If their new CEO is Captain Obvious and acts like he hangs out here, they'll win.  If it's somebody who gets all his ideas from ad people in the boardroom, give up now.  Ad people are so fricking out of touch with the world that they can blast loud ads at people for a third of the time they watch TV and nobody pays attention.  Seriously, acephalic children have more brains than that.

Yahoo's weakness is not in performance/function but rather image.  It lacks the trendy 'cool' factor, which is fine as long as it isn't trying to compete for the mainstream.  It needs to pick a niche and brand itself around that.  Discover your target audience and then run with it.  MySpace is never going to compete with facebook, but it has a loyal core that despises facebook.  Yahoo should do the same.

i've always used yahoo as my portal to the web. i enjoy the layout, customization options, and the email interface is good. the chat used to be better when it was more customizable to your local areas, but I understand that there was too much nasty stuff going on there. Now all the chatrooms are overrun with adbots.

I've been with Yahoo since the beginning as well, and I can't tell you how many times I felt like what they had was good but then they went and changed it and screwed it up in the name of "improving" or "updating."  The new stuff always sucked.  I like new technology as much as anyone and I'm not stuck in the past, but Yahoo dropped the ball way too many times.  You know who else is doing this?  It starts with F and ends with book.  Every change they've made in the last 2 years has sucked.  Their current picture viewer is pure garbage.  Wait a couple years and watch that company go down the toilet too.

I can tell you one thing that is seriously awrong with their Email is that you can't save any messages to a file on your computer. You can make a folder for saved but it stays on the yahoo site. What good is that when I'm working off line & need some quick information. I used to be able to archive them on the yahoo program & then download a batch of 10-15 at time & then edit them,but they done away with the archive feature saying the users didn't need it,& that was after they changed the steps you had to go thru to find the archive tab after they moved it mutiple times every couple months to another location. Thing is, compared to other Email programs yahoo is really easy to use. I've tried several others & they suck real bad.

I've been with Yahoo! almost since the start.  In the beginning, they'd get an idea, but then they'd never follow through.  Take Yahoo! auctions (http://auctions.yahoo.com)--now it's just redirected to shopping, but at one time, their auction site was pretty good--no listing fees and an alternative to eBay.  But then they lost interest and all sorts of crooks and fraudsters began to take over.  They never gave the impression that they were serious, and eventually killed the service.  I think it still survives on Japanese Yahoo.

But I haven't seen anything really new or appealing from Yahoo for the last 10 years.  Its search engine is inferior; local TV listings have been dropped from My Yahoo!, and the mail interface has gotten more difficult to use.

Maybe Yahoo will be the next Excite!--just a shell with news and mail and lots of ads.

I have worked in Broadcast TV for most of my life and the problem with Yahoo is it's too generic. 

Here's what Yahoo does well:
1) Lots of services
2) Good homepage for quick news 
3) Everyone knows the name "Yahoo"
4) The comment boards are addictive!
5) A good (not great) email service

Here's where Yahoo needs improvement
1) Yahoo doesn't target specific demographics geared just for them, or at least doesn't make it a priority. 
2) The auto playing video feeds with ads you can't shut off are annoying, and keep reloading when you hit the NEXT button.
3) Too much spam.
4) Yahoo needs to go cross platform. Example Yahoo messenger and push email to your smart phone.
5) Needs More Viewer benefits, like web exclusives.
6) Services need to be grouped better. Right now it's just clustered together, and it's alot to got through to find what you want.

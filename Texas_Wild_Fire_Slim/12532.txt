       9/11/2011 9:45 p.m. EST As a family of alpacas grazed nearby, a sweet, late-summer breeze dislodged leaves and ruffled a flag at half-mast as hundreds gathered in observance of the tenth anniversary of 9/11, and in honor of the 100 years of service provided by the original building that would become Silver Bluff Village in Haywood County, Western North Carolina. On Sunday, the facility once known as the Haywood Infirmary, and later as the Pigeon Valley Rest Home, celebrated its 100th Birthday. The festivities began on a solemn note, remembering the tragedy of 9/11/2001 in remarks by Bob Leatherwood and with an invocation by Rev. McNeil, which was followed by a minute of silence. Attendees joined Grammy-nominated bluegrass group, Balsam Range, singing “God Bless America,” and Balsam Range entertained with two masterful sets. In celebration of the 100th Birthday, Silver Bluff Village dedicated a plaque in honor of Iola Kenny—grandmother of current owner Lisa Leatherwood—who, in 1962, founded the family business that would become Silver Bluff. Ms. Kenny’s ashes were interred at the facility’s new waterfall. Employees who have been employed at Silver Bluff for five, ten, fifteen, twenty, and twenty-five or more years were recognized and given awards.  A barbecue picnic was prepared by the owners and staff of Blue Rooster Southern Grill, a restaurant in Clyde located at the old Wal-Mart site, and was enjoyed, along with the music, by all participants. The event was a respectful and fitting tribute to the memory of 9/11 and the noteworthy history of Silver Bluff Village. Article Copyright ©2011 by Bob Etier. All Rights Reserved.

This is an accurate picture of America--in Canton, NC, and in small towns throughout the country. We are lucky enough to live in a beautiful area where most people are genuinely grateful for the sacrifices of others. All of America may not be like this, but all of any country isn't exactly the same.

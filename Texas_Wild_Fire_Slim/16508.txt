Watcher of Weasels Nominations – Beating the Class Warfare Drum Edition
September 7, 2011By MaggieMy article on the Tulsa mosque with terrorism ties is an honorable mention this week at the Watcher of Weasels Council. You may remember that a Tulsa police captain was transferred to less desirable duty for refusing to force his officers to attend a barbecue lunch at the mosque honoring Tulsa police (many in Tulsa and around the country saw this as inappropriate due to the ties to terrorism the mosque maintains). I am always so proud to be considered and chosen by the Council to appear on their site. Winning nominations will be announced Friday, but in the meantime, take a look at the list below and read some of the best writing on the Internet.

Welcome to the Watcher’s Council, a blogging group consisting of some of the most incisive blogs in the ‘sphere, and the longest running group of its kind in existence. Every week, the members nominate two posts each, one written by themselves and one written by someone from outside the group for consideration by the whole Council.Then we vote on the best two posts, with the results appearing on Friday.
This week’s contest is dedicated to our Watcher’s Council Birthday Girl, Terresa from the Noisy Room!

Best wishes form all your Council mates and many happy returns, M’dear!
Council News:
This week, The PostWest, Constitutionalists United For Libery, Maggie’s Notebook and Capitalist Preservation took advantage of my generous offer of link whorage and earned honorable mention status.
You can, too! Want to see your work appear on the Watcher’s Council homepage in our weekly contest listing? Didn’t get nominated by a Council member? No worries.
Simply head over to the ‘Contact Me’ page at Joshuapundit and post a link to the piece you want considered along with an e-mail address ( which won’t be published) in the comments section no later than Monday 6PM PST to be considered for our honorable mention category, and return the favor by creating a post on your site linking to the Watcher’s Council contest for the week.
It’s a great way of exposing your best work to Watcher’s Council readers and Council members. while grabbing the increased traffic and notoriety. And how good is that, eh?
So, let’s see what we have this week….

        The five suspects who were charged with war crimes and terrorism in February 2008 in front of military committee are still awaiting trials behind bars in Guantanamo Bay.  Obama Administration focuses on the justice for September 11, 2001 terrorism suspects. United States prosecutor Eric HolderEric Holder is continuously repeating the statement. However, the statement is pretended of not being heard and the trial has not been started.  In 2009, Eric Holder said that September 11, 2001 terrorism suspects will be brought to New York for justice. They will answer their crime in front of the court and they are expected to provide fair trial, Eric added.  Similarly, in March 2010 Eric Holder announced for the trial for the suspects. More than one year has passed but the suspects are still behind bars and no concern of trial is being heard. The leader of the group is Khalid Sheik Mohammed, a 46 years old man from Kuwait. They all are in the risk of death penalty.  Do you think this is the right justice made for them? Do they still deserve life behind bars or should bring to trial?         1 of 17

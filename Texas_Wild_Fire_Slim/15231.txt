Up until recently I’ve just mixed the food together and given it a shake each day before feeding.  Granules in one pot and wafers in the other.
However I always thought it would be better to be able to select each morning what food types I’m going to feed that day.
Ok so maybe I am on the spectrum somewhere but I thought it would be an idea to trial and the box was only 63p! (Note the added elastic bands around the seal to make it airtight  ) )
If you’re interested the generic food was from www.discusessentials.com/ and my fish, shrimp and snails love it.  There’s still no beating the Hikari algae wafers but I like to mix them up a bit.

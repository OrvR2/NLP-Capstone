   crowdSPRING Reveals Trend that Redefines PersonalizationPRWeb – 14 hrs ago





   The new king of creative crowdsourcing is the almighty consumer according to crowdSPRING, the leading online source for crowdsourced creative services.Chicago, IL (PRWEB) September 07, 2011  crowdSPRING, the world’s #1 marketplace for crowdsourced creative service, is known as an innovative and affordable provider of high-quality creative for small businesses and mass brands. crowdSPRING has seen a surge of projects from consumers looking for one-of-a-kind designs of invitations, greeting cards, personal websites, logos and themed party favors.  
“Crowdsourcing creative has been indispensable to businesses but consumers have just recently begun to experience its many benefits,” said co-founder Mike Samson. “Gone are the days when people purchase pre-designed invitations customized with their information or use fill-in-the-blank design templates. Consumers are now tapping into crowdSPRING’s creative community of nearly 100,000 designers from around the world to create their own never-been-seen before design from scratch. Designs and writing are based on an easy-to-write creative brief that covers personal preferences ranging from favorite color schemes to message.” 
Even the busiest consumers can easily post creative projects and name their price using crowdsSPRING’s simple process. In turn, creatives submit their ideas and the consumer chooses the one they like best. Buyers not only receive massive choices, but get what they want, when they want it and have total control over the design. 
“For years, businesses worldwide have successfully used this company for innovative websites, logos, product graphics, stationary, industrial design and writing, among others categories, to generate quality creative at more affordable costs than traditional agencies,” added co-founder Ross Kimbarovsky. “Creative crowdsourcing offers all the same benefits including faster turnaround and set prices, and all intellectual property rights are transferred to the buyer.” 
For sample creative projects, statistics or additional information about this trend, visit http://www.crowdSPRING.com or contact Lauren Russ at lauren(at)connectcomsinc(dot)com.

John Turner and John Morrison don't know if they are still neighbors in their Magnolia RV trailer park in Waller County.
The two friends were living in identical trailers next to each other when they evacuated Monday because of a wildfire burning out of control. But a constable late Tuesday told them the fire gutted their trailer park. He showed them photos he'd taken with his cellphone for proof.
The two evacuees could see nothing left but a single trailer that looked like one of theirs. They don't know if it's even livable. Neither had fire insurance.
"I don't know if we could live together, though," said Morrison, 67, a retired machinist. "We both have dogs that fight as soon as they get near each other."
The two neighbors had moved there after fleeing a wildfire at a different trailer park in June. "And now here it got us," said Turner, 66, a retired heavy equipment operator.
Both were numbed by the news and unclear what to do next. "Denial comes to mind," said Morrison. "They told us it could be days before we can get back in there and look."
They won't be alone. A large raging wildfire has burned thousands of acres in Montgomery, Waller and Grimes counties, forced hundreds of residents to flee and shut down several roads and schools.
Ken Snyder's eyes teared up as he recalled grabbing important papers and "baby stuff" for his newborn son Monday as he fled the blaze. He felt the heat and heard crackling from the flames that were no more than a 100 feet behind him as he and his fiance, Angie Gerstler, roared down their driveway in the Remington Forest subdivision near Magnolia.
He has not been home since, but relatives called to report seeing a "helicopter view" of his backyard where firefighters were spraying down his burning fence on national TV.
"We still don't know if our house is standing. They tell us that at least half the homes in our subdivision are gone, burned down," he said. His subdivision lies just across the Waller County line about 4 miles from Magnolia in Montgomery County.
When Snyder left his son at a Labor Day party at his brother's house to check on his property, he thought he'd have more time to secure it. "You could see the flames shooting about 30 feet above the treeline way down the road when I first got there," he said. "But 10 minutes later it was on top of us. It was moving so fast."
Snyder and his family were among more than 100 who sought refuge at the Red Cross shelter housed at Magnolia High School where classes had been canceled Tuesday.
One injury reported
So far the shelter manager, Lain Causey, said the only fire-related injury there was an 80-year-old female evacuee who was rushed to the hospital in respiratory distress from heavy black smoke.
Boo Henderson, the farmer's market coordinator for Magnolia, showed up there Tuesday with her husband who was cradling their dog, Jazzy, in his arms.
But they were forced to make such a hasty departure that 50 chickens, 20 goats, two rabbits and a pair of peacocks had to be left behind on their 4-acre spread in the Magnolia West subdivision.
"We had just located a trailer and a place to put them when we heard the sirens and loud speaker ordering us to get out now," she said. "We thought we were safe until the fire jumped across FM 1774 and headed toward us."
Inside Magnolia West High School, weary groups of soot-covered firefighters tried to unwind over plates of brisket in the cafeteria.
They started arriving Monday from Crosby, Tarkenton, Galveston and other volunteer fire departments, including units from Harris County communities. By the time they sat down to eat, some of the firefighters had been up for 36 hours or more.
"It brings tears to your eyes to try to save some of these homes and then have to give up and back away," said Crosby VFD assistant chief Richard Clark, 48.
Fickle tornado
Firefighters described a fast-moving, unpredictable wall of fire that behaved like a fickle tornado, leaving entire streets untouched and then engulfing a group of homes nearby.
"When we got here this morning, it looked like a bomb had gone off," said Isaac Pinson, 31, who described acre upon acre of scorched farmland and pockets of rural families at the end of a road desperately trying to save their homes with buckets of water. They had refused to evacuate, he said.
"The wind is what's doing it," he added.

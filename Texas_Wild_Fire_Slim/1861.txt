The President and His TeamSusan Estrich's column is released once a week. By Susan Estrich | Susan Estrich – Wed, Sep 7, 2011





These days, I try to avoid conversations about President Obama. It's not that I've lost interest in politics. It's just that most of them don't go anywhere. They start with all the hope people had when he was elected and then go quickly downhill to disappointment. And because it is much easier to blame the people around him than the man himself, I'm constantly faced with questions I can't answer — or rather, questions that I can answer but that satisfy no one.
Why don't they tell him that he needs to stand up for something?
Why don't they tell him that he needs to focus on jobs instead of the deficit?
Why don't they tell him that he needs to put the Republicans on the defensive for protecting corporate America instead of the middle class?
Why don't they tell him that people hate these games of chicken that are being played in Washington?
Why don't they tell him not to schedule a speech on Wednesday when the Republicans are debating, only to look weak when he has to move it to Thursday?
Why don't they tell him not to go to Martha's Vineyard on vacation when so many Americans are out of work and can't afford vacations?
ETC.
Here's the short answer: They do.
When you're on top, you're a genius. Everyone tells you how smart you are.
When you're not, all you get is advice. The one thing I am sure the president is not short on right now is advice. The one thing I am sure White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, one of the smartest politicos I've ever met, is doing is passing along advice. 
It's not that no one is telling the president. They are. They're not holding back on good ideas. It might be that there is some brilliant answer on the table that he is just not seeing. But I have my doubts.
The truth is that the buck stops there. If you want to blame someone for the president's missteps, blame him. He chooses his advisers. He decides what advice to accept and what to reject.
Speaking for myself, if I had a silver bullet, I'd pick up the phone. 
Some things are easy to see. It's still the economy, stupid, as James Carville famously pointed out during the Clinton campaign. There is no problem Obama has right now that couldn't be solved by a substantial reduction of the unemployment rate.
Oh, they could play the political dance better — look stronger, make different scheduling decisions; he could vacation less and play less golf. But none of that matters very much one way or the other if one in 10 people is looking for work and can't find it. 
The president will, no doubt, unveil a laundry list of programs that he is pushing now and remind us of the ones he pushed in the past to try to create jobs. The Republicans will respond by saying big government is part of the problem, not part of the solution; the private sector needs to be unleashed; red tape needs to be cut. Rhetoric is easy. Plans you don't have to pass are easy. Progress is hard.
What the Obama presidency has revealed, painfully, is not how much power a president has, but how little, particularly when Congress is in the hands of the opposing party and it's an election year and the leaders of that party — both in the House and the Senate — are determined to defeat him. 
What he has — all he has — is the power to persuade: the power to persuade Congress that they will pay a price if they don't act, the power to persuade the media that he is doing everything that can be done, and ultimately, the power to persuade the public not only to stand behind him, but to show their confidence by spending money and buying houses and, most importantly, creating jobs.
This president showed an uncanny ability to persuade during his run for the presidency. He persuaded the country to trust an African-American first-term Senator over candidates who, on paper, had far more experience than he. As president, he seems to have lost that power, that touch. Too many people, including those who supported him, see him as arrogant and aloof. Too many believe he has lost his way, succumbed to Washington, forgotten his message. Appearance is reality.
Yes, we can. Millions responded to candidate Obama. Now it's time for him to prove that, yes, he can.

It is refreshing to have someone who has been close to President Obama's sphere of influence explain what they see in Mr. Obama! We find that when he first ran for office his words held great influence!  Seems this has changed! Also it has been pointed out that the President, no matter who he is, is responsible for his or her own actions!  With the President, it seems that the magic has gone out of his words! Why?  When words are not backed up by action,  they become meaningless!

Why do people like Susan Estrich keep making excuses for Obama. He is the Harved grad (so he says) smartest man in the room and the man who was going to bring change to Ameica. Over the past few hundred years WE THE PEOPLE have built this country and Obama has no right to try and change it.

"particularly when Congress is in the hands of the opposing party"
Uh, no.  The opposing party has 1/2 of Congress, the House, by a reasonably slim majority.  Democrats have the Senate and the POTUS.  All he's ever needed to do was put forth reasonable centrist plans that a very small small minority of Republicans in the House couldn't possibly say "no" to.  Instead, he tried to ram blatantly partisan plans down their throats that even some members of his own party didn't support.  Evidently, he's never heard of the concept of "a little sugar for the bird".  
For that matter, he refuses to put forth actual plans...he just spews up talking points and buzz words strung together in focus group approved ways and calls the resulting speech a "plan".

It could be that he has failed his constituents by failing to meet the following campaign promises (which were his primary selling points):
1. Get out of Iraq (still there, and added troops in Afghanistan and added a new war without Congressional approval)
2. Close Gitmo (won't happen) 
3. Increase employment 
4. Transparency (passed Obamacare without allowing Congress or America read the bill - it was well within his power to post the bill online or televise the negotiations as promised during his campaign)
5. Get lobbyists out of the White House (he has a long list of lobbyists, union heads, and commuinists that are czars and that consult him regularly - check the White House visitor log)
6. He promised to never sign a bill with pork, then signed the $1 trillion stimulus bill, which was 100% pork. Furthermore, had to include pork in Obamacare to bribe his own party to vote for it. 

Candidate Obama was an idealistic, naive fool. Or a liar.

Then, while in office, he 
1. Has crippled oil production in the US by freezing all drilling applications
2. Threatens to increase taxes on businesses and investors in every speech he makes (which is why there are trillions of dollars not being invested right now), 
3. Has stifled the recovery with heavy regulatory requirements at every opportunity. This includes Obamacare, which has more regulations than any bill ever passed - and there is more to come. The bill requires most regulations to be written by committees that were formed after the bill was passed. 
4. Wants to spend like crazy, but thinks that military spending must be cut. How is military spending less stimulative than the billions in ridiculous research projects funded by the Stimulus package? Yet he pushes for military cuts, which will make the country weaker during a time of massive global strife. 
5. Has not passed a budget since he has been in office. 
6. Increased spending 24% since he took office, which spurred the formation of the Tea Party and led to our debt downgrade. His favorite word is unsustainable, yet he seems to think that borrowing 40% of what we spend is sustainable.
7. Doesn't have anyone on his staff that is committed to growing private sector jobs in the US. Obama's jobs Czar, GE's Immelt, just outsourced thousands of jobs to China. 
8. Annually, he declares that he will not sleep until he improves the jobs situation. He did it when he was elected, then took a break to develop the shovel ready jobs stimulus program (which turned out to be a flop because there are no shovel ready jobs - by his own admission), then started on jobs, then took a break for a year while he did Obamacare (which has put the breaks on jobs while HHS develops the monstrous regulatory requirements for insurance and employers), thn he got started on jobs, then took a break to pass Cap and Trade (another job killer and economy killer, which failed - thankfully), then started on jobs, until the debt ceiling debate, now he is vacationing so e can work on the economy and jobs. Does he have ideas that he has held in reserve until now? If so, why? 

If you can't win against this record, you are not trying.

The problem seems to be that he has surrounded himself with advisers of similar background to himself. They are all academicians, nothing but career students. All they know is economic theory. Economic theory works excellent in the classroom, but sometimes not so well in the real world. But you will never convince them that their well established theories cannot be proven. And when the largest economy in the world is at stake, it's no time to run experiments.

The problem, once again, is no one reads the Constitution.  The president has very little power.  The power resides in the Congressional branch of the government.  They make the laws.  Sure, the president can veto, but so what?  The congress can override that veto.  The next time you go to the ballot box, look at your representatives, not the president.  What Obama has shown us is what we should have already known:  The Congressional Branch has the power, not the president.

Sorry Susie, but his problem is that far too many in the country are unwilling to follow him now.  It doesn't matter what he does.  He sold himslef to the American people fraudulently and Americans are not stupid.  They eventually will see through fraud.  This guy is no leader and never was.  He's a radical pedant who is heading for a hard fall.  He may even take the country with him.

You had better get it through your head.  Most Americans are NOT liberals.

Over the edge, eh Sue.  YOUR president created this mess by bypassing the unemployment problem he "promised" to fix in 08.  Instead step-n-fetch-it slammed a unwanted healthcare down our throats, and as Nero did, he just whistled and laughed at the Constitution as he was burning down OUR democracy.  Then chubby boy jimmy hoffa and his inflamatory sob remark and YOUR president keeps on whistling.  Palin is the real deal, sweetheart, obama is a step-n-fetch-it for another Lewinsky, and I'm not talking about Monica.

An American President shouldn't need so much "advice", and there has been plenty of writers trying to do so. You shouldn't elect the leader of this country and the free world on words alone. Without the history and record of taking a position, actually debating and supporting it with an articulate working solution, how did this happen? It's 3 years in and I'm as forgiving a person as anyone, but at this point just reacting to problems that were foremost in urgnecy 3 years ago does not get a pass now, just because he was forced to address them. Where are the candidates that understand they are our ultimate representatives to the world and project our best qualities with confidence and adherence to our principals with strength of character? Why did we elect someone to judge and lecture to the populace of our own country, as if we don't know how to tie our own shoes? No president is to just let his party chiefs do all the work , and leave him spotless. That was the history, and it continues today. Now it's expedient to suddenly respond out of necessity, not because he really had his head around it. It was all wrapped up in something else entirely that has gotten us nowhere further down the road. He's still "sitting in the ditch" looking in the rearview mirror, wondering "what if", as if anyone gets elected because it's an easy job.  It wasn't supposed to be left or right, it needed to be straight ahead and down the road with driver that knew that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Not meandering around trying to "fundamentally change" America. That got us nowhere really fast.

Hey Susan; the next time you are tempted to support some vacuous empty suit just because of his skin color and political affiliation, maybe it would be a good idea to do a little bit of research and see if you can determine if he has any leadership skills and experience whatsoever.

You jumped on the Obama bandwagon with no more information than the fact that he was telegenic and a good reader. (As in teleprompter)

If that is what passes in your world for diligence you should go hide under a rock and keep your mouth shut while adults try to figure out how to fix the serious problems this guy is creating.  

For you to now avoid conversations about your anointed leader speaks volumes about your mentality;  once you screw something up badly you try to pretend like you had no part in it.  Not surprising really.

I know it is hard to say,Susan, but he is in over his head. Just like a Con man, he promises, he tells you what you want to hear, he convinces you he has the answers; but when you fall for it, reality never is what you fell for.

Liberals defend Obama with the "not his fault" defense. This is just more of that. Yeah, she says it's up to him but blames everything around him (and gets it wrong). Obama may have no problem but the economy, but the economy has a problem and it's Obama. Obamacare, $1.5T deficits, Dodd-Frank, Elizabeth Warren, bash the private sector, push for taxes, bash the GOP and complain that they won't work with you while you maintain an attitude that winner takes all... I have said it before and Obama proves again, he just isn't very smart. Policies matter and an agenda that is built on finishing of a liberal check list 100 years old is bad policy.

If this were a rep president the press would be demanding his head on a stick for starving kids, homeless drug addicts, and ad  finum There massive drove of college pundits would be spouting out advice by the reams and telling us how stupidly the rep. were so at fault, etc.  But until Jan 2011 The Dems held majoritys in the Congress plus the WH and not one obsticle to doing their will but not one percent of change downward in the unemployed was made.  And it is Bush's fault....duh???

Hey Sue, dispite your cheerleading for Obama you missed something.  The house has passed bills and the Senate has become the place where things don't happen.  

Secondly the power the president has is (or should be)  to move his party to get things done.  No president has any say over what the members of the other party do and trying to bully them is just going to lead nowhere.  What the president needs to do is twist his own party into accepting deals.  When you have that power then you can go to the opposite party and craft a deal.  Without it the otherside knows you have no power and will ignor you.

For example.  During the debt talks with the house if Obama had 50 or 75 Dem votes in his pocket then Boehner could have worked around the Reps who wanted more cuts and no taxes.  But because Pelosi didn't give Obama the support (or Obama never though of even asking) Obama went into the talks with no leverage.  The result was a last minute poorly written bill that was passed.

Can't wait to hear your tune, Susan, the next time a Republican president is embattled, facing a hostile Congress and a dissatisfied electorate.  You won't be up there telling him, "Yes, you can".  You, along with all of the rest of the lib nutcases, will be screaming for his head, just like you've always done.

Feds propose endangered status for rare SF plantAP – 4 hrs ago





SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A rediscovered San Francisco plant once thought to be extinct is being proposed for the federal government's list of endangered species.The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service on Thursday will ask that the Franciscan manzanita — which was last seen in San Francisco in 1947 — be covered under the Endangered Species Act.In 2009 a botanist driving over the Golden Gate Bridge spotted the flowering shrub in an area of the city that had been cleared for a road project.The plant was saved, but environmental groups sued to get it protected. Fish & Wildlife's proposal would keep the case out of court.Brent Plater of the Wild Equity Institute, one of the plaintiffs, says with federal protection the plant would again become a part of the city's biological community.

Wow, I thought this one was long gone. Surprised that Cal Trans did not plow it under.

Wait a minute.  If it's already been declared extinct for 64 years then how can it now be declared endangered.  If anything, it seems to be doing fine on its own.

This article is confused with the other article that talks about a partial ban on nudity in San Francisco. The rarity in San Francisco might be a clothed straight man and the Feds may be right to put them on the endangered species list.

I would've liked to have seen a photo. It may be rare, but who cares if it's not pretty! ( Unless it holds the key to curing Cancer or Aids or advance civilizations beyond our hopes and dreams.)

Dig the crap up and put it in a greenhouse if it's so valuable. Guess what? A whole lot of species disappear every year in places that man has never seen.

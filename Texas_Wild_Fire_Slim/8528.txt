And in a few years Europe is full of imigrants, refugees of this bloody war, thanks to NATO.﻿ This crap needs to be dissolved.
At the beggining, the excuse for the formation of NATO was the "Red peril", now there is no "Red peril" in around the Atlantic ocean, but it still exists. This is an absurd!

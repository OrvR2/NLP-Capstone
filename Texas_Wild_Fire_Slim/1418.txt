 San Francisco News






On Sunday, hundreds of brides, grooms and vendors gathered at Terra Gallery for San Francisco's inaugural Unveiled SF. 
The event, which is usually held in Beverly Hills, was the first San Francisco version, and was hosted by Martha Stewart Weddings, San Francisco Brides, Vera Wang and others. Guests drank champagne, ate cake and hors d'oeuvres and rubbed shoulders with SF elite, like Stanlee Gatti, who spoke in a "state of the union" wedding address. 
The icing on the cake: Vera Wang premiered her 2012 bridal collection in a stunning runway show. Gone was 2011's delicate, ethereal theme. This year's sentiment was decidedly over-the-top, with trains, a dark palette, and bodices for all the drama brides could handle. 
Check out pictures of the gowns and the event in the slideshow below, courtesy of Colson Griffith and Gustavo Fernandez.

she looks terrible, which is a real shame because she could be so beautiful. Pasty skin, straw hair platered to her head. an extra 15 lbs. would do so much for not only her figure but the rest of her as well. maybe it's time to send her to a hospital for eatind disorders.

She is beautiful no matter what she "wears!!!"  Why don't YOU keep your crappy comments to yourself!!!  My mother used to say (may she RIP), "If you can't say something nice~~~don't say anything at all."  Believe me no one wants to hear bad things about ANYONE!!! : (  &  : )  Kathi from Wichita, Kansas. :)

Hi gang, I'm making a revision to my earlier comment, handcuff to your partner out for the evening. I just noticed the name of the handcuff clutch bag. I like to be positive so instead of control and ownership, It will be renamed "Devotion"....Isn't that nicer...ALOHA.....

I'm sure those handcuffs are appropriate for someone who can appreciate the symbolism to chains and being tied down...I'm sure Brad can relate to that perfectly...how ridiculous is that as a fashion statement...bubble brains only in Hollywood...

She looks gaunt. Her skin looks like it is sliding off her elbow. Tattoos??? Goes with the handcuffs!!!! Look at her bony fingers. Nice eyes. Let's not forget those lips! LOL

I'm SO sick of the whole "evil Angie STOLE Brad from Jen" story. Is Pitt such as sap?ENOUGH, people! GET A GRIP.

DID Jennifer "STEAL" him TOO, from poor little Gwyneth, BEFORE that? Because I remember at the time she kept crying to the press about how devastated she was & would NEVER love ANYONE that way again..And now she's all grown up, moved on & seems to be a pretty happily married wife/mother with Chris Martin from Coldplay, her career is going well again...She seems to be handling this "adult" thing fairly well.

WTF?? Accept that the relationship was already in trouble. I really just DO NOT get this STILL being the general consensus. FIRST of all because anyone who thinks they can possibly KNOW how anything "really" happens between people this famous probably think "reality TV" is actually "real"  & have, at best, a tenuous hold on their own "reality". And secondly, if you stop to actually think about it from an evidenciary point of view (using, you know, logic?) it makes NO SENSE whatsoever!

What did she use to steal him? Love Potion # 9? Black magic? Billy-Bob's blood (I mean, his name starts with "B" too....I guess if your mojo is evil enough.) Was it all part of some nefarious yet brilliant  plan she used her Machiavellian genius & succubus wiles to work out years before? SO..Brad was just an innocent victim here? Was he just NOT ABLE to resist this wicked temptation & then decide he'd settle for the object of lust because it would be too hard to work it out with the woman he REALLY LOVED and had been so blissfully happy with?

Because IF a man can be SO EASILY "STOLEN" from his wife it's generally because he can't keep his pants zipped up & gives in to lust. Once that gets stale a guy who's REALLY committed to their partner tends to realize he messed up pretty bad & desperately tries to "fix it", to win her back bc  he's obviously SO happy with & can't stand to lose because THEIR love is PURE and REAL, not like the sleazy lust he gave into in a moment of weakness.He doesn't usually quickly start adopting the "stealer"'s adopted children as his own too, stick with her through 2 pregnancies & then STAY with the woman for about - what...6 years now - despite the fact that every other week about 10 magazines keep running a story about how they're about to REALLY implode THIS TIME, for SURE, the writing's on the wall THIS TIME, because of [insert whatever lie you think will sell more copies of your rag here & just cite a source "close to" one of them].

Call me stupid, but any couple who've managed to stay together despite the fact that they can't even go out for dinner or take their kids to the park without having a small army of people take photos and it becoming a front page story seem pretty solid. I can't possibly imagine a relationship surviving a year with this kind of stress & insanity always going on. 
You can't go buy milk without seeing one of this couple's faces on at least 3 magazines.  

What's really getting "stolen" here? Probably our minds.The REAL manipulators are gossip rags who exist only to maximize sales & know precisely how to do so. "BRANGELINA! How bloody brilliant of us! We can increase our projected profits for the next quarter now that we made up this silly nickname!" Why do we care so much? Were they the first celebrity couple to EVER behave so "scandalously"?

Incidentally, poor little Jen seems to go through men like fashion trends. She seems to maybe want a lasting relationship...So unlucky in love! I guess it's all Angie's curse to blame. 
Wow. That's some power...

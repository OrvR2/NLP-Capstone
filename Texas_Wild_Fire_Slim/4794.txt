Packers crowd gets patriotic with huge American flag display By      Chris Chase


The 2011 NFL season got off to a patriotic start Thursday night with a coordinated American flag display by 70,000 Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.
During Jordin Sparks' performance of the national anthem, fans held up placards to make a wavy flag that could be seen from above by NBC cameras.


At first I thought that it was pretty coincidental that everyone at Lambeau color coordinated their sweatshirts enough to make this happen. Then it dawned on me that all that Packers green and gold would probably make a Jamaican flag instead and that they were actually holding red, white and blue placards that had been left in their seats.
The visual was even cooler when seen from the blimp covering the game:







[Photo Gallery: Packers outlast Saints 42-34]




These sorts of displays rarely impress me and I realized tonight it's because there are too many fans in the crowd who either aren't in their seats or don't care enough to participate. That's not a problem in a place like Green Bay, where I'd imagine love of America runs second only to love of Aaron Rodgers(notes) and the Packers.
Sparks did a fine job with the anthem, much better than the last time the song was sung at an NFL game (cough, Christina Aguilera, cough). But, for my money, the best part of the festivities was the flyover by four F-16s immediately after the conclusion of the song. Flyovers by military jets always get the goosebumps going but this one was even more special, perfectly timed by the 115th Fighter Wing of the Wisconsin Air National Guard.
We've all seen what they look like on television. This YouTube clip shot outside a house in Green Bay provides a different angle.
 
Funny, when you watch the game on TV, you never think that those planes have to come from somewhere.

0 users disliked this comment Britt...Britizzle...bert_ ... 4 minutes ago Report Abuse I am a huge fan. Im from Milwaukee...it stinks when people have negative attitudes... i heard the other day that friends going were expecting these green and gold signs that said Go PAck Go...we were all excited to see this at the bar i work at but rather to see the patriotism from all the players and Lambeau was awesome. i thank anyone who wasnt too critical of something that was meant as a sign of respect in a time that we are to remember those who have fought for this country...and it was hard either way...Even after Katrina i dont think any real Packer fan would have been too upset from losing if it came out of respect from Louisiana who although much better is still rebuilding from its own devistation. Its nice to see people see the focal points they made tonight, not the winning or losing part...there is a huge season ahead...this didnt determine anything but hope for us all with a way to remember those we should never forget!

It doesn't matter how many other times such art has been done, but rather how great a pleasure it is THIS time.   Thank you for the great pictures and the video of the flyover.   i had to watch that several times, it was so great.

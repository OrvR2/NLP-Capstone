(09-07) 19:20 PDT VALLEJO -- 
A state appeals court on Wednesday upheld the voluntary-manslaughter conviction of a Vallejo man who shot and killed his ex-girlfriend, an off-duty Richmond police officer, outside a funeral in 2006.
 Quartus Hinton, 32, a parolee with a lengthy criminal record, was sentenced in 2008 to 38 years in state prison for shooting Kaliah Harper, 28, outside a memorial service at the Fairfield Community Center for two young cousins of Hinton who had been killed in a car crash the week before.
 Authorities believe Hinton shot Harper because she broke up with him. Hinton maintained that he acted in self-defense, shooting Harper six times with a .45-caliber handgun on Nov. 24, 2006, because he believed she was about to shoot him. He also told investigators he believed Harper and her family were conspiring to kill him.
 Prosecutors had charged Hinton with murder with the special circumstance of lying in wait, which could have resulted in a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. But a Solano County jury convicted Hinton of voluntary manslaughter and a weapons charge.
 In his appeal, Hinton said his conviction and sentence should be set aside because of juror misconduct and new evidence in the case. In a ruling Wednesday, however, a three-judge panel of the First District Court of Appeal rejected the claims.
 Harper attended De Anza High School in Richmond and Cal State Sacramento before graduating at the top of her class at Napa Valley College Police Academy. She was promoted to the Richmond police narcotics task force while still a probationary hire. She made 350 arrests and received 12 letters of commendation praising her work.

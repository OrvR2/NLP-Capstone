Perhaps there's no color more bold than white -- nor more wildly suggestive, whether it be of angelic, peaceful or downright virginal promise. And perhaps there's no color that gets more of a run on this first weekend of September, adhering to that oft-cited "don't wear white after Labor Day" rule. But before we retire our white jeans to the closet and bid summer's favorite shade adieu, we thought we'd assemble a completely irreverent, randomly assorted collection of some of our favorite celebrities-getting-down-in-white moments. Behold, our end of the summer tribute to white, in famous-faces-and-bodies form.

				Laborday, seeing these nice celebs. What is it they do ? work for a living ?
Please take an hour and a half of your time: These Are My Heroes
H a r l a n C o u n t y USA

Video Documentar­y

Least we think that America was built by the starched shirts and expensive suits featured on FOX News and CNN. This documentar­y will help to remind us that our freedoms and working conditions were not won by U.S. soldiers in foreign lands but through the suffering and sweat of our fathers and grand fathers in their struggle against commercial interests.

				The wearing of white on Labor Day is a subtle ideologica­l attack on the meaning of the holiday. Just as red is associated with the Bolsheviks during the Russian revolution­, white is associated with the nationalis­t Anti-Bolsh­eviks who opposed the Communists­. May union and pro-labor groups wear red occasional­ly as a gesture of solidarity with progressiv­e labor movements worldwide, and the wearing of white on the day on which the labor struggle is commemorat­ed is a symbolic slap in the face of working people the world over. Just sayin'.

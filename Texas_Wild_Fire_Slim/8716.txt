S&P lowers Whirlpool outlook to 'Stable'AP – 14 hrs ago





CHICAGO (AP) — Standard & Poor's Ratings Services lowered its outlook on Whirlpool Corp., to "Stable" from "Positive" Wednesday and reiterated the world's largest appliance maker's "BBB-" corporate credit rating and other ratings.S&P said the change in outlook is due to its expectation that the rough economy will hurt Whirlpool's net income, though the agency still thinks the company will be able to keep its credit profile intact."In our view, weak demand — especially in developed U.S and European economies — highly competitive conditions, and material cost inflation will likely prevent the company from improving credit measures, despite continued price increases and potential productivity improvements," the S&P said in a statement.

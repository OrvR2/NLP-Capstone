Should you Buy, Sell, or Stay way in this Market Correction?By Panos Mourdoukoutas | Forbes – Fri, Aug 5, 2011




Related ContentShould you Buy, Sell, or Stay way in this Market Correction?


After a turbulent week that pulled almost every financial assets down to earth, investors wonder whether now is the time to buy, sell, or hold on to financial asets. Some  have been calling in popular financial experts for advise and comfort.
"Should I sell my stocks in my 401K account?" asked recently a financial investor, calling in a financial  expert on a popular TV show.
"How old are you?" asked back the financial expert.
"Forty five years old"
"You don't have to worry. You don't need the money for another 15 to 20 years. Markets will come back. They always come back."
Investors and financial professionals love clichés about the performance of certain asset classes over the long-term. They do offer comfort of the mind, especially when markets move against investor bets, but they can be very costly for investors who stick with them.
Here we unveil and defy three of those Clichés:
Clichés 1: “Gold always goes up. You cannot lose money in gold.” Really? What if you purchased gold around 1982, when the metal was around $800 an ounce and sold it around $260 in the early 1990s? You collected no interest or dividend over ten years, and lost close to 70 percent of your principal! Obviously gold doesn’t always go up. But what if you kept your position until now? You certainly doubled your money, but that took 20 years—a 3.6 percent annual return, hardly beating the return of a money market account.
Cliché 2: “In the long-term, stocks always outperform every other asset category.” This is a well-searched proposition in the finance discipline, and in many cases it is true (provided that dividends are re-invested), but it isn’t always true. The performance of Japanese stocks over the last twenty years is a case in point. The Japanese Nikkei Index is down 70 percent. Yes, 70 percent over twenty years!
Clichés 3: “Real estate always goes up.” This is also a well-researched proposition, and it is generally true, but not always true. US investors who purchased real estate in the early 1980s and sold in the late 1980s fared well, but those who purchased real estate in the late 1980s and sold in the middle of the 1990s did lose money. And, of course, there is the case of the Japanese real estate, where investors lost 40 percent of their money over the last twenty years.
The bottom line: Certain assets outperform other assets most of the time, but all the time; and this can be dangerous to investors financial health, as the they can suffer significant losses.

I think a "not" fell out of the last sentence -- "but all the time" should be "but not all the time", yes?

this kinda sucks. putting your saving in stock = scary ride with no idea whats ahead.
putting your money in bank for like near 0 interest = getting less and less valuable as inflation keeps kicking in.
buying rare metal = ITS TOO LATE now sucker, 1830 / ounce of gold is crazy.

what do you do??

“Gold always goes up. You cannot lose money in gold.” ....Gold is going up because of inflation and the general perceived  real worthlessness of the American dollar,not the still in control American banking system that is showing signs of another crash.

I personally would keep buying. But I would be more selective. I prefer going through directly through the companies and do my own research. 
Because every time someone gets involved and handles your money, they are going to be taking a percentage. So eliminate all of the middle persons. It is the only conservative way of doing it.

A poorly written article that overstates certainty of accurate capital markets assumptions, and misuses examples to disprove those overstatements.  Obviously no asset class "always" goes up.  Even investment-grade corporates or United States treasuries can and regularly "lose" value at times subject to interest rate risk, but not if don't sell in those markets and hold to maturity.  That's why the importance of time horizon and developing an appropriate portfolio to weather corrections is so important.  No, not every period for each major asset class has a positive return, but that's certainly the long-term trend: Growth.

You've selected a few very negative periods of correction for particular asset classes.  Well done.  As a professional journalist, even though you don't "always" proofread your work, and I can find a handful of glaring grammatical errors in this piece, you likely have written far more coherent sentences than not.  Similarly, if you consider rolling ten-year periods of the S&P 500 from 1927 to today you'll find the vast majority have positive returns, and the worst negative was less than 4%.  

(Alright, perhaps that's not a fair analogy.  The index has had prolonged periods of negative returns, but none so atrocious as this piece.)

Add to that the fact that most investors in qualified plans have been dollar cost-averaging, making purchases in volatile markets and "buying low" during market corrections, they've likely outperformed that index.  Furthermore, if they adopted an appropriately diversified strategic asset class allocation based on their time horizon and risk tolerance and simply rebalanced regularly, they'd likely further improve that return.  I'd all but guarantee you won't find a 10-year period of loss in a portfolio that's 60% S&P 500 and 40% Barclay's Aggregate Bond Index, or better yet: 25% S&P 500, 10% Russell 2000, 15% MSCI EAFE, 3% MSCI EM, 3% DJUBS-CI, 4%, DJ US RE, and 40% Barclay's Global Bond Agg.

And the Nikkei, really?  What was the value of the Yen over that same period?  The purpose of investing at it's core is to keep pace with and potentially outperform the rate of inflation.  Domestic equities tend to be one of the best hedges against domestic inflation, and in fact part of their growth is due to inflation (inflation can be good?).

Proofread your work, and focus on an area you understand.  I'm embarrassed for Forbes associating their name with this drivel.

What about fixed interest funds?  I have one that is 27 years old and never, I repeat, NEVER, had a down year.  I may have never have enjoyed record growth, but I never had to cry in my beer over a painful loss.......  Tortoise and the hare and I see the finish line coming!

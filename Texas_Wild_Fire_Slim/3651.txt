Brow BasicsBy Marilisa Racco | Flare – Thu, 8 Sep, 2011 12:00 AM EDT

If you thought your eyebrows were immune to the trends, think again. Although fundamentally contingent on elements that won't change with the seasons - i.e. your face shape and bone structure - they can still be tweaked to complement your makeup or the overall look you want to achieve. Ultimately, though, the final result should always look natural, says Natalie Gee, co-owner of Gee Beauty salons in Toronto and Bal Harbour, "even if that means erring on the side of bushy brows."
Here she shares her top tips for getting perfect brows.

GO TO A PRO


You probably wouldn't cut the hair on your head at home, so why treat your eyebrows any differently? "If you've never shaped your eyebrows before or are a chronic over-plucker, go to a professional who can tailor them for you and then you can do daily maintenance at home just by following what they've done," Gee says. "A professional will be able to see your eyebrows from a different angle than you do just staring straight on in the mirror." Whatever you do, though, Gee cautions to always err on the side of bushy brows. "Less is definitely more when it comes to tweezing." 

If you don't already have one in your beauty black book, Gee says to listen to your eyebrow pro for some key words or phrases that can denote whether you should stay or you should go. "If a brow architect says things to you like 'we need to totally reshape your brows' or 'thin them out', that's not good," she cautions. "You want someone who will emphasize your natural shape and work with your features."

WAXING VS. THREADING


Maybe Gee is biased on this point, since she only does threading, but she stresses, "it really is the best way to shape the brow." Because the threads can target individual hairs, it is more precise and gentle on the delicate eye area. "Wax stretches and pulls the skin," she says, which probably isn't what you want to do to if skin laxity or elasticity is a concern. 

Between appointments, maintain your shape by tweezing stray hairs, preferably post shower, as the steam will help to open up your pores. Gee warns against tweezing anywhere where the hair is really dense, as it's easy to get carried away. "Pluck the sparse hairs that are really noticeable, and avoid plucking too much at the ends as this is the hair that over time will stop growing in," she says. "Thicker ends make you look younger."

FIND YOUR SHAPE


It's important to determine what the right eyebrow shape is for you before you start experimenting with different looks or trends, Gee says, but always keep in mind that you shouldn't fight what you were given naturally. "Anyone with a round face should stay away from rounded eyebrows," she says, "but don't try to create an arch that isn't already there." Gee suggests brows with lengthened ends to help add angles to the face.


Heart-shaped faces should embrace their natural arch to balance out a thinner chin, while square faces with a strong jaw line should follow the arch but soften it a little. And anyone with a long face should opt for a more tailored brow with shorter ends to help draw the focus to the eyes. 



MUST-HAVE TOOLS


To keep your eyebrows in tiptop shape, Gee says these three tools are a must in your brow arsenal.


1. "Invest in a really good tweezer, preferably with a slanted tip, as this will allow you to target the individual hairs and pull them out at the right angle," she says. If possible, test them out before you buy them.

2. "A brow brush is essential to moulding your brows to suit your look, whether it's neat and tidy, or a little more wild and unruly."

3. "Get a brow filler - either a powder or a pencil - which will help fill in any sparseness and allow you to control how strong or defined you want your brows to be."

TRACKING THE TRENDS


This fall, fashion is taking a decidedly boyish turn and eyebrows are following suit. "The look is more bushy, undone and a little messy," Gee says. "It's not totally grown out but not completely tailored like we've seen in the past."


While the bushy trend might be too much for some people to embrace, Gee points out that brows can be tweaked to suit fall makeup trends, too. "If you're going to wear a dark lipstick, which is really big for fall, create a balance with a more defined brow," she says. Conversely, if you're opting for a dramatic eye in shades of purple, don't define your brows as much and just brush them up for a more natural effect.

Unless your name is Groucho Marx or Gene Shalit, bushy caterpillar eyebrows are not acceptable on any woman in any walk of life anywhere and I don't want to hear otherwise.

I consider it an extravigance to get my hair cut, let alone have someone do my brows. Judging from the brows in the pictures, it's for the best. Way to big for those skinny, boney faces.

Some of those women in those pictures actually look a little scary, like their brows are too bold or something.... Don't follow trends, just do what looks best on you or what feels best for you.

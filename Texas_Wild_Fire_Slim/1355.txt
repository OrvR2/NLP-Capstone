Forecasters:  New solar flare won't cause problemsAP – 10 hrs ago





WASHINGTON (AP) — Forecasters say a new solar flare should provide only a glancing blow on Earth on Friday and is unlikely to cause any problems.The National Weather Service's Space Weather Prediction Center says northern lights may be slightly more visible, but there should be no radio, satellite or electrical grid disruptions.They say the flare that erupted from a sunspot Tuesday is fairly big, but most of it will miss Earth, going far above the planet.Senior forecaster Norm Cohen said the flare should arrive around 1:30 p.m. EDT Friday, but is nothing to worry about.___Online:Space weather center: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/

How come when this happened last month the media was saying that we were lucky it didn't come in our direction because it could have had catastrophic effects but now we have one coming our way and we shouldn't worry?

N.J. Amputee Seeks Fire Job, I Say Yes!
2 comments






His name is Isaac Feliciano, he runs a 12.5 second 100 meter, and he scored 106 out of 600 in the physical agility testing. I would be proud to have him on my engine. Story

U.S. Firefighters Lend Hand Down Under
Comments Off






Bushfires ‘unprecedented’
“The bushfires in Australia’s state of Victoria have been described by the local Emergency Services Commissioner as unprecedented. The crisis caused a major power crisis in the state on Tuesday. But the worst of the bushfire season could be yet to come.” Radio Australia
Amid that tone some 100 U.S. firefighters packed their gear and headed to Australia to assist locals.  After a two day primer they will be staged awaiting new fires in Victoria, more.
As is becoming more relevant in these disasters is the information from bloggers living in the midst of the incident. These Flickr photos came from the backyard of this blogger.

Something Wrong About This
Comments Off






From Firehouse.com,“Ellreese Daniels — charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter — was the crew boss during the Yakima, Wash. Thirtymile wildfire in July 2001. 
 Prosecutors allege that Daniels should have known that the four firefighters who perished in the fire would be trapped and should have better protected them. 
 The fallen firefighters were Devin Weaver, 21, Jessica Johnson, 19, Karen FitzPatrick, 18, and squad boss trainee Tom Craven, 30″
This could, maybe should, have a chilling effect on aggressive suppression activity by some.  Something to consider, how far up the chain of command could or should a prosecution go?  Firefighting is dangerous.  No one feels worse about injury or loss of life than the supervisor or fire boss.That being said I would want answers if my child was one of the fallen.

Winner News Photo(over 100,000 circ.)
Winner News Feature 
“Deadly Delays:   The Decline of Fire Response”
“Once a day on average in this country, someone dies when fire fighters   arrive too late, an investigation of fire response times by the Globe has   found. America’s fire departments are giving fire a longer headstart,   arriving later each year, especially in the suburbs around Boston, Atlanta   and other cities. Growth is brisk but fire staffing has been cut.”
Winner News Feature (Web based News Site)
“Three Alarm Fire Tears Through Jacksonville’s Historic Springfield Neighborhood”
“This story, about a fire that started in an abandoned house and spread to eventually destroy three houses and damage two, focuses on the 100 Jacksonville fire fighters who reported to the scene, several of whom were injured.”
Complete list of winners here.
Congratulations to Roanoke Fire Local 1132 for affiliate website runner up award.

We've watched Jon and Kate Gosselin raise their eight children in front of reality show cameras. We've seen countless family vacations, temper tantrums and eventually, a divorce. Now that the TLC show -- once "Jon and Kate Plus 8," now just "Kate Plus 8" -- is signing off for the last time Sept. 12, the family's matriarch is worried about how she’ll continue to provide for her children.
"I'm freaking out. Big time," Kate Gosselin told PEOPLE for their latest cover story.
In August, TLC cancelled the once-popular show, which chronicles the life of Gosselin and her eight children with ex-husband, Jon. After the announcement, Gosselin took to Twitter to share her thoughts on what is life-changing news for her family.
“We've had a great run! Six years of whirlwind funfilled adventures thanks to TLC and our many many supportive &diehard fans!,” she wrote, adding, “I poured my entire self in2 the last6years of 'Kate Plus 8' & I can't wait2have the chance2challenge myself again w future endeavors!"
So what’s next for Gosselin? She’s apparently thinking about getting into TV production.
“I know when things translate into TV. I’m good at it 'cause I live this life,” she told The Huffington Post. “I have had people come to me and say ‘I have this great idea for a reality TV show.’ I actually, in my mind, can play it out and see it happening ... for me it's like writing a living book and I really love to write.”
But don’t think that just because “Kate Plus 8” is going off the air that this is the last we’ll see of Gosselin and her brood. 
"TLC hopes to check in with Kate and the family periodically with specials in the future," a rep for the show said at the time of its cancellation.
The finale episode of “Kate Plus 8” airs September 12 on TLC.

				How will I get attention? Where will I find free plastic surgery? Who will watch the kids while I party? Who will raise the kids while I party? Where can I find other showers of money and fame? Will all my fans still love me?

				continued:

All of them not just the kids should have money saved up. The kids (all of them), their money should be in some type of trust so that at a certain age they get the money. It'd be nice if it was set up something like this, When you turn 16 you can have enough to get a car, price can be no more then XXXXX amount.  Then when they graduate from high school they can take enough out for college, if they don't go to college they have to wait until a certain age, but the ones that went to college and graduated from college get a bonus of XXXXXXX amount. The non college kids don't get any bonus.  Then when they hit say 25 or 30 they can have the rest.I mean I think conditions like that would be good ones.

				Finally,  the wicked "B~ ~ ~ ~H will be off the air. The kids are rude, and not very well mannered, and I'm talking about the 2 older ones.  Heck, the 6 younger ones are almost worse then the older ones. I mean when you 8 kids and 2 of the younger ones get kicked out of school, what does that tell you?? I can't believe that she's complainin­g, well, yes I can because that's all she ever does. Nothing is ever good enough for her. Now, she's a nurse so, go back and take your state boards and if you pass get a nursing job. Now, with some of the money that has been saved, please get the kids (all of them) some type of help.

				I think she has way more money than she will let on.  She's really worried about not becoming richer and no longer being famous.  Some couples or singles (Octomom) think having multiple births is a way to make lots of money.  It worked for a while with Kate.  Luckily it hasn't worked for Octomom.  Stick a fork in it Kate, you're done!!!

Canadian journalist recalls terrifying day he was to be at the World Trade CenterBy Liam LaheyPostsBy Liam Lahey | Daily Brew – Fri, 9 Sep, 2011

Liam LaheyThe Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the United States was much more than a television event for me. I was there.
On that day, I was scheduled to attend an IBM press conference at 9 a.m. at the top of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Luckily, I never made it on time.
Although I didn't appreciate it at the time, I am now truly grateful Air Canada had overbooked my flight and as a result, a delay ensued. That delay likely saved my life and the lives of a half dozen others I know.
It was to be a simple, single day round trip from Toronto to New York City. A six-hour jaunt to NYC to attend a typical press conference. Big Blue wanted to wow a handful of Canadian IT and business journalists by treating us to breakfast at the top of the WTC.
Well, we were "wowed" all right.
My Air Canada flight from Toronto to La Guardia International Airport that beautiful September morning was delayed by about 30 minutes taking off. I was in an incredibly foul mood as a result, figuring I'd now be late for the start of the press conference and I'd miss breakfast. (You'd be angry too if you missed out on such an opportunity)
I had a window seat aboard my flight, facing east. As our plane approached NYC, I can distinctly recall seeing a thick, black line etched across the clear, blue sky. It was as though someone had taken a black permanent marker and scrawled an ugly, uneven line across what was otherwise the most perfect, blue canvas. I sat quietly wondering what the hell it was.
Upon descent into La Guardia Airport, the twin towers came into view and it was abundantly clear a massive fire raged from the WTC. My only thought at that moment was, "I guess I'm not going to work today." Aboard the flight, dread must have set in for the passenger cabin was as silent as an empty church.
We landed safely and while taxiing to the terminal, the pilot informed us over the plane's sound system an extraordinary circumstance was underway.
We were instructed to forget our luggage and carry-on bags and to vacate the airplane and airport as soon as the door opened. The pilot needn't have worried. As soon as the air flight crew cracked the hatch, a large, burly police officer stepped aboard and began barking orders, "Everybody off of the plane right now! Let's go! Leave your bags! Get off the plane and get out of the airport!"
I knew NYC to be a fast-paced city compared to Toronto but this was ridiculous.
Within a few seconds, I was literally running with thousands of other frightened and confused people out of the airport, across seemingly endless parking lots, scaling hills and fences, racing toward a hotel on the other side of a six-lane highway. It was like a scene out of a Godzilla movie frankly.
I watched the towers crumble from that overcrowded hotel. I stood in shock and silence as people around me raged, cried, panicked. No payphones would work. No cellphones would work. This was unlike any business trip I had ever been on. I had no change of clothes, and being a more junior reporter at the time, little money in my pocket. More importantly, I wondered what was happening in Toronto if NYC was under attack.
Eventually I was reunited with other Canadian reporters who made the trip. We were stuck on Long Island for the next week, waiting for the bridges leading to the mainland and back to Canada to open.
For its part, IBM treated us like gold. They put the six of us up in a gorgeous bed and breakfast in the Hamptons and offered us any mode of transportation home we wished. I chose to drive home with one friend through one of the Quebec-New York border crossings. Few others were open at the time.
Crossing the border on Sept. 17 wasn't an entirely unusual affair. On the U.S. side there were a handful of police, soldiers toting machine guns, and other officials keeping watch. On the Canadian side sat one French Canadian border guard who asked us where we had been and where we were headed.
It was one long drive. About 17 hours later, I was back in Toronto, sitting on my couch watching the endless news coverage of the burning twin towers. The weather was still beautiful and yet the world would never be the same.
Some journalists immediately sought to capitalize on the moment but I did not. All I could do was weep.

Nicely put, Liam. Thank you for your story. Ignore the board morons, they simply need to bang at keys to get their day underway. In my case, just living in a border town at the time was evidence that our world had changed forever. Hundreds of semis parked on the streets or in makeshift lots, stranded because the border was closed. The people of Niagara Falls were bringing sandwiches and coffee to the drivers . . . it was inspiring, yet frightening simultaneously.

"Some journalists (immediately) sought to capitalize on the moment but I did not. "

Oh. Really.
The irony of this "article". He chose not to capitalize, but then writes this article. I'm sure he wrote this for free??
I'm not against articles in general, but this writer is just lame bs.

I was in New York two days before, and was planning on staying a few more days to tour. I left because it was so hot 40+ and the air was making me ill.
So I guess I "escaped" this unfortunate incident as well.

Every single journalist and photographer, who witnessed the event, had only one thing on their mind:  Pulitzer.  Now that it's been done, they come out and express their true selves.

September 11, what a sad day for thousands of people who died for corporate greed transaction and  war in Iraq.....Wait a min what the hell does that have to do with 9/11? exactly and I am still waiting for some one to be charge from 9/11 and i see one picture of Bin laden dead and that was their proof??You actually think a bunch of people from a country who is so ghetto and running around in caves in their slippers have the brains to take down the most secure building??? And you know whats interesting about the Team Russia hockey team plane that crash a few days ago???Atleast I saw the plane crash parts and people who died in the crash. Flight 93 incinerated into the field and the pentagon plane supposely flew like light speed into the pentagon and still no plane parts. War generate economy. American corporate killed their people if anything.

Atleast this guy bad luck day turn out to be good luck as he was one of a few who dodge the bullet. Others were sacrifce for the so-called terriost attack.

Honestly when I saw the title I thought this would be a great story however after reading it, I think you're writing style is garbage.  You seem to be making light of what happened to others and highlighting your own so called tragedy, I think you're disgrace to humanity and reporting and should not ever put one more word down in print.

Thank you for sharing Liam.  I think we will all remember exactly where we were when we heard of the attacks.  Pray for all the innocent men and women who lost their lives that day and for all that have fought for our safety in the past ten years.  A senseless tragedy that changed our world........

I have a friend who often worked at WTC, but was in Europe on 9/11.  But we didn't know he was abroad until over a week later.  Needless to say we were very relieved.  Our friend unfortunately sufferes from survivor's guilt and probably PTSD.  But we are glad he's still with us.  We are all damaged in some way now...

April 7, 2010 -- College Station, Texas -- Texas Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service have joined forces to conserve and protect the Lone Star State's natural resources.The agencies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to strengthens the cooperation between the two by coordinating the assistance provided to landowners.“While both agencies in Texas have a long history of program delivery and cooperation among foresters working in the field, we believed it was important for us develop a state level MOU that would align our organization’s priorities and compliment each other’s ability to assist Texas landowners,” said Jan Davis, stewardship and forest policy coordinator for Texas Forest Service.The MOU focuses, in particular, on forest-related conversion assistance for private landowners, which is designed to help sustain the health, diversity and productivity of Texas' private working lands including forests, crops, pastures and ranges.For more information on this partnership, read NRCS signs MOU with Texas Forerst Service.

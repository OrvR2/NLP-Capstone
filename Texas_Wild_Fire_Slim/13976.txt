						Urban Farm					



 
Speaking of unassuming places, this just in…
“I love that tucked away off of the major thoroughfare, W North Loop, lies an “Urban Farm” called Resolution Gardens.”

 

 
“… I love how seemingly environmentally aware Austinites are and how entities, such as Resolution Gardens, work hand in hand with the community to ‘integrate cultural practice, business and environmental concern into enterprises that advance community sustainability.’”
If you have any photos/commentary on why YOU love Austin, please send them to faithloveaustintoo@yahoo.com and YOU will be featured in our blog!

						Besos in the Greenbelt					



 
I have a confession to make. Before yesterday, I had never been to the part of the Greenbelt in the Mopac/Capital of Texas Highway corridor. As I was exploring, I came across a beautiful sight underneath the north bound Capital of Texas Highway overpass. Along one of the walls, in Old English stenciling, the word “Besos” (kisses in Spanish). My heart melted and a big smile spread across my face as I soaked it in. I love finding little niches of art in the most unassuming of places. And the fact that it spells out kisses… well, that just makes it better.

						Oh, Happy Friday!					






It’s been a heck of a week… and that is putting it tamely. (Gotta keep it rated G here, folks.) With all that has been going on, it is a great pleasure and fun distraction to share with you some of the Why we Love Austin postcards that have come in!
“I love Austin because of it’s diversity” … “I love Austin because it is a good place to relax” … “I love Austin, but not because of 6th Street” … “I love Austin because it is the pup capital of the world!”
We love getting your cards in the mail and seeing what you love about the fabulous city that we live! To participate, pick up a card from around town (they are everywhere, guys!), fill it out and mail it in (postage is already paid!!)! If in the event you cannot find a postcard, you can print one off here OR email photos/commentary to faithlovesaustintoo@yahoo.com.
Happy Friday, everyone!

						Texas Wildfire Animation					



 
I found this online… watch how quickly the fires grow and just how widespread they are.
This morning brought some good news as the fire in Bastrop has been 30% contained and finally some “big guns” were brought in with the “10 Tanker.” The “10 Tanker” has the capacity to hold 11,600 gallons of flame retardant. So, hopefully, as the smoke clears, there will be nothing but “blue skies” with the chance of rain.

						Texas Wildfires					


I am utterly heartbroken for all of the people that have lost their homes to the wildfires that continue to blaze through Austin and it’s surrounding areas. My husband and I were out to dinner with a couple of friends when we first learned of the fires blazing through Bastrop. Our breaths were baited as we began calling his family (that live in that direction) to make sure they were alright. (And, thankfully, they were out of harms way.)
My husband and I took a drive out to his parent’s house to ensure their safety, make them tell us their plan of action in the event of evacuation, take pictures for insurance purposes and pack our car with important photos and documents that they couldn’t fit in theirs. As we drove toward the direction of the flames, we could not believe the enormous smoke cloud, sitting ominously on the horizon. The span of it was absolutely massive.
My husband and I will be donating money to a local church, and I humbly request that if you can donate, please do… I have found a list of different places you can donate goods and funds on a local news station’s website (KXAN), posted below. If you know of anywhere else to make a donation, please feel free to add it to the list.

						Postcard Friday Love!					








I am head-over-heels in love with the postcards today! (I have A LOT more to post, so stay tuned for next week!). I love all of the details in each, do you see the lipstick kiss on the mustache card?… I adore the cowboy hat on the taco!… The burger order at the Alamo Drafthouse… The simple, beautiful detail of the Pennybacker Bridge… “No Tunnels” just cracks me up!… and is there anything better than “Peace, Love, P. Terry’s and Rock-n-Roll?!” I think not!
TGIF, everyone! I hope this finds you all (or, rather… “y’all”) gearing up for a nice, long weekend! Keep the postcards coming in!
peace, love and rock-n-roll,
Faith-n-Danielle

						Walsh Landing					



So close to the heart of the city, yet so far away from everything is Walsh Boat Landing. Tucked away on Scenic Drive, this boat landing provides easy Lake Austin access. Just west of Oyster Landing, you can enjoy lunch at one of the restaurants and then walk over to the ramp to catch a Lake Austin cruise, meet some friends on their/your boat (trailer parking is right across the street), take “Fido” for a swim, or dangle your feet off the side of the dock as you admire the green hills and serene water.
Walsh Landing holds a very dear place in my heart, as it was here that I began to fall head over hills in love with my husband. We sat on the dock gazing up at the night sky and the ripples of the moonlit water as we listened to the gentle lapping of the water knocking against the dock. It was hopelessly romantic and the perfect place to fall in love.

						Stevie Ray Vaughan					



Before I could really talk, I knew who Stevie Ray Vaughan was and all about his music. My aunt loves to tell me stories about how anytime I was with her and an SRV song came on, she would ask me within the first chords strummed, “Who is this?” And in my 3yr old voice, without skipping a beat, would respond, “Stevie Ray Vaughan!”
Austin was where Vaughan called home, after moving here at the age of 17, when he began his music career. August 27th marked the 21st anniversary of Vaughan’s death. With his legacy, he left behind six Grammys, five W.C. Handy Awards, inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame (post-humerously), a Fender produced “Stevie Ray Vaughan Signature Stratocaster” and most noted,his musical influence.
In 1993 City of Austin erected a statue in memorandum of the Blue’s Hall of Famer along the shore of Town Lake, just steps from the Auditorium Shores stage location where Vaughan had performed many times. Fans from all around the world come to pay tribute, often leaving flowers and assorted memorabilia.
Even after over 20 years of the loss, Austin still revers Vaughan’s presence and is eternally grateful for the musical history his legacy has bestowed.
And, this my friends, is just another reason why I love Austin.

						T.G.I.- postcard – F.!!					




Happy Friday to everyone! I have a couple of gems to share with you this week… postcards featuring none other than our colorful Leslie (he could arguably be Austin’s mascot for “Keep[ing] Austin Weird”) and my husband’s favorite, the trademarked Burger-Tex.
I had the great pleasure of attending a Perch Co-working event. A big thank you to Rebecca from The Rebeccamendations and Localize Austin for inviting us out and letting us hand out Why We Love Austin postcards! The company kept was awesome, the response was unbelievable and the postcards that were filled out are phenomenal (I cannot wait to share)… so, stay tuned for next week’s postcard Friday post!
If you see a postcard anywhere around town, pick one up, fill it out and mail it in! You can also submit photos or text explaining why you love Austin to faithlovesaustintoo@yahoo.com… you’ll be featured in our blog!
Happy weekend-ing!

						Holy Culture, Batman!					



I realize most of the content here is subjective, so today I will give you complete fact.  Brace yourself… Our City Hall looks like it is a building straight out of Gotham City, and that is super, way awesome. In fact.
Built in 2004, Austin City Hall stands as a “unique landmark gateway to Austin City government. The building and plaza serve as a gathering place for public discourse and community collaboration with informality, friendliness, environmental sensitivity and innovative technology. Built of Texas limestone and sitting on the site of a once-raucous 19th century bordello district, Austin’s copper-clad City Hall is as unique as the community it serves.”
I encourage you to read the history of the land where City Hall resides (click on “bordello district” above). It turns out that even in Austin’s infancy (late 1800s), it had a remarkably diverse culture and environment that cultivated entrepreneurial spirit. And that, my friends, are a few of my favorite things about this city.

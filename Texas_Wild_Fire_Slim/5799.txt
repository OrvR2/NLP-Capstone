The Fast Fix: Can Perry debate?By Chris CillizzaPostsEmailBy Chris Cillizza | The Fast Fix – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

Rick Perry's rapidly growing popularity with the GOP will make him the focus of Wednesday's presidential debate.

All eyes in Wednesday's Republican presidential debate will be on Rick Perry. It's the first time on the national debate stage for the Texas governor who has rapidly emerged as the frontrunner in the race for the Republican nomination.
So, what should we expect from Perry?
There's not all that much to go on. Perry refused to debate his Democratic opponent in the 2010 Texas gubernatorial race and hasn't even been on a debate stage in 18 months.
Reviews of the debates in which he has appeared are mixed.  Most people see him as a serviceable if not spectacular debater.
What we do know is that Perry has never been in a debate setting like this one. With the entire national press corps looking on, Perry will be poked and prodded -- both by the debate moderators and his opponents.
Given his lead in national polling, Perry doesn't need a home run debate performance. But, he also can't take a big swing and miss since that sort of stinker would step on the momentum he has built over the past three weeks.
Perry's likely strategy in the debate will be to play it relatively safe -- sticking to his talking points and not doing the sort of ad-libbing that can get a newly minted candidate into big trouble.
But, his opponents and the moderators will do everything they can to knock him off that script and force him out of his comfort zone.
It's going to be a very interesting night.

This is a message to all of you, everyone of you, every voting age American. Don't you get it after all these years? The politicians do everything in their power to keep us divided and all the while it is business as usual. There is not a magic person in the bunch, Democrat or Republican that is going to change one damn thing. I hope that all of you saw the net worth of some of those people in Washington that say thigs, like, "We feel your pain" or "We understand your situation." Bull. Congress did not cut their pay, congress did not get pink slips, nor were there any layoffs on Capitol Hill. They did, however cut medicare for our elderly, and cut verteran benefits. Did one Marine in Afghanistan get a big pay raise? So if you believe one word any of these false prophets, fake Christians, and down right greedy people say, then you are an idiot. They will only help people that can "donate" to their campaigns, their big business buddies that run our country. Folks, I hate to inform you of this fact, but, Corporations are not the people, we, us citizens are the epitomy of "WE THE PEOPLE." Thank you and let us take back our country from these animals.

Perry wants to get rid of  EPA like they did in his state in 1993 Brownsville.  And corperations that quickly moved to this southern Texas town wanted cheap labor but ended up being sued by mothers whose babys had empty skulls upon birth. Recall the speghetti brain babies.  Don't forget who else pretended to be from Texas to pay less taxes and got us into two wars while at the same time cut taxes that could have paid for the war and kept us out of debt.  The GOP is done, no wonder they spend more on security to protect themselves then on creating work for Americans. The GOP can go and nobody would care.

It is amazing Mitt Romney, a man whose family has cowered from military service for generations, is for enhanced torture. Romney also claims strong moral values, supports tortures which includes extreme sexual humiliation, rape, including children raped in front to their parents, and explicit sexual contortions. On second thought, somehow it doesn’t seem too shocking Romney supports the sexual abuse of children and the tormenting parents by mocking the sexual abuse of their children. Not shocking at all.

Does congress read any press about the low rateings of Mr. Obama, the same reports state congress aprovall is even lower due in part to their narrow mindedness over the budget and refuseal to compremise with the President. all of you polititions should try to work to improve our great country, not your political party

Perry said he came off his political campaign trail to come back to Texas because he cares about the people who are going through devestation due to the fires.  He also said it is not about politics right now and said he would not leave until the fires were out.  This was said just two days ago and he's already breaking a promise.  I guess he never really left the campagin trail after all!!  He's no different from any other politician.  It's all about who can lie best...and apparantely, he's not very good at it since he has been caught in a lie from two days ago!

explain to me how this guy wants to get help for Texas from the federal gov. but wants no help for anyone else from the same source! This is exactly what I have been saying about the republican mantality, you can't have any, but we get it all and more! I call it double standard as well as ignorant!

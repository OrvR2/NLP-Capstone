Controversial NHS reform passes first testAFP – 3 hrs ago




Related ContentPrime Minister David Cameron addresses the media in London. The proposed overhaul …

The proposed overhaul of the state-run National Health Service has cleared its first hurdle after MPs in the lower House of Commons voted in favour of the controversial bill.
MPs voted for the reforms by 316 to 251 on Wednesday, but the bill now faces a difficult passage through the House of Lords.
The bill has split the coalition and drawn criticism from the medical profession with critics fearing the wideranging changes could be a step towards NHS privatisation.
Supporters claim the reforms will afford patients better protection and raise standards by offering a wider choice of health care providers.
Prime Minister David Cameron, who was forced by opponents to postpone the bill's passage through parliament in April in order to make amendments, said the shake-up would strengthen the service.
"The point of our health reforms is to put doctors in charge, give patients greater choice and heal the divide between health and social care," he said at Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions.
"I believe that they will lead to a stronger NHS and better outcomes for patients," he added.
Four members of the Liberal Democrats voted against the reforms and a further 11 did not vote.
The most controversial point of the plan would see responsibility for commissioning services removed from local boards and handed to healthcare professionals, potentially widening the role of private providers.
Health Minister Andrew Lansley promised that safeguards would be implemented to limit private involvement and said the reforms were essential to make sure the NHS "is fit to face the challenge of tomorrow".
Shadow health secretary John Healey accused the bill of "giving health reform a bad name".
"It's unwanted and unnecessary," he added. "It's reckless to force through the biggest reorganisation in NHS history at the same time that finances are tight and pressures on the health service are growing."

Mrs. M Thatcher privatized everything but could not touch the NHS. The baby-face Cameron did. Thatcherism follows the US Conservatives' doctrine: it is the fault of the poor to be poor and it is the fault of sick not to have health insurance irrespective of circumstances.

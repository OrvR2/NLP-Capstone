Set up your study or picture in an orderly fashion. This order should not cramp either the linearist or the colorist... Never lose sight of that first impression by which you were moved.

It is no disgrace to start all over. It is usually an opportunity.

Dust Art

Posted by Charley Parker at 8:41 am 
 


Just for a little amusement on a Friday morning, and to point out that anything that allows you to make a mark can be a medium for visual expression, here’s an article from the Austin American-Statesman about Scott Wade, who draws reasonably complex images in the road dust that accumulates on the back of his Mini Cooper. 
Wade uses his fingers, as you might expect, but also paintbrushes, to lightly smear or lift off the dust, and popsicle sticks, I assume for a “palette knife” effect.
Talk about temporary art.

Flight 3

Posted by Charley Parker at 6:39 am 
 


Yesterday was Wednesday, the day when most comic shops get their new comics for the week. I stopped into Between Books, the unique little bookstore/comics shop in Delaware where I buy my comics,  and was delighted to find a shiny new copy of Flight 3 waiting for me.
Flight 3 is the third and much-anticipated installment in the Flight series of comics anthologies. The Flight books are about the potential – more than that, the realized potential – of alternative comics, of the revitalization of the anthology as a viable comics format, of the transition of comics artists from the web to print and of the artistic voices of a new generation of comics creators.
If you find superhero comics unappealing (or just a bit tiresome), or if you are just curious about what else the comics art form has to offer, here’s a great place to start: 26 independent comics artists gathered in one volume with fresh, vital and individualistic visions of what comics can do and say.
Among the creators in Flight 3 are a number of artists that I’ve profiled in previous posts here on lines and colors, including Rad Sechrist, Kean Soo, Michel Gagné (also here) and Kazu Kibuishi (also here), who is the driving force behind the Flight anthologies.
For more information see the the Flight blog, and Kibuishi’s Bolt City. Also see my previous post on the preview for Flight 3.
The Flight blog features a terrific Flight 3 Preview section with lots of sample artwork. (There is even a Flight 4 mini-preview on Newsarama.)
Here is an Amazon link for Flight 3, as well as the previous volumes, Flight 1 and Flight 2.
Even if you think you don’t like alternative comics, or especially if you think you don’t like comics at all (I’m talking to the fine art contingent here), try to find a copy in a comics shop or bookstore and just leaf through it. You may be surprised at how you take to Flight.

Brad Aldridge

Posted by Charley Parker at 8:33 am 
 


Utah artist Brad Aldridge paints landscapes that seem at once generalized and specific. They may or may not refer to actual places. He eschews grandiose, dramatic landscapes and opts for intimate, quiet scenes, often of small streams, which I particularly enjoy. 
Aldridge works in oil on prepared panels and prefers a muted palette with understated colors, subtle tones and an emphasis on the visual texture of his scenes. There is very often a subtle focal point of an individual shrub or tree. If you study several of his paintings, you’ll realize that his has deftly controlled the path your eye takes around his compositions. 
The frames for Aldridge’s paintings are unique and seem specific to the individual paintings, as if they were considered part of the finished work and not simply a showcase for it. Alridge creates most (or all) of these frames himself.
In many cases he has created paintings on panels cut to unique shapes, often incorporating rounded or gothic arches at the top of the panel, that have corresponding frames, cut to emphasize the unusual shape of the panels.
I haven’t found a dedicated site for Aldridge, but he is represented by a few galleries who feature his work in their sites. The Joyce Robins Gallery has a good section of Aldridge’s work, as well as a nice essay on the artist by the gallery’s owner.
Bennett Galleries has a smaller selection. Leslie Levy Fine Art has 7.
Despite an awkward and inconveniently “clever” horizontally scrolling interface (in which you must hover your mouse over a link and wait for the Flash script to scroll the images at its pace, not yours), the Arcadia Gallery site still has the best selection of Aldridge’s work I have been able to find, as well as the largest images.
[Addendum, December 2010: The links provided seem to have gone bad in the past four years. Here are current links to Brad Aldridge on  Susan Calloway Fine Art, Gallery 71, and McLarry Fine Art.]

Samuel Michlap

Posted by Charley Parker at 7:44 am 
 


One of the really great trends I’ve noticed in the past year is an increase in the number of animators, production designers, storyboard artists and character designers who are keeping blogs, posting their work and often discussing their creative process.
Samuel Michlap has been a layout artist, art director and production designer, working for companies like Disney and Dreamworks. He has worked on films like The Lion King, Sinbad, Shark Tale, Eldorado and The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
He works in acrylic, gouache, and, when time allows, in oil, as well as working digitally in Photoshop. Some of his comps are done in Prismacolor pencil on a heavy toothed board. 
He has just recently started a blog, featuring some of his professional work as well as sketches and quick studies, including work done in front of the TV or while riding in the car.
His blog is not currently linked to his web site, which appears to be under construction but still has some of his figurative and gallery work. You can also find some of his gallery paintings, with a nice emphasis on trains from the mid 20th Century, in the Howard Manville Gallery site.
Through the variety of his work, you will find a broad variation in approach in terms of texture, brush handling, composition and overall palette. You will find consistency, however, in his deft handling of color and value. He controls mood, light, the focus of attention with careful color relationships that are sometimes subtle, sometimes bold, but always effective.
I particularly enjoy his evocation of 19th Century Paris (image above), done after visiting Paris while working on Disney’s Hunchback of Notre Dame. 
(I just have to take an aside here and say I would have loved to have been at the meeting where somebody pitched the idea for that movie. “It’s the Hunchback of Notre Dame, see, except without so much… well, tragedy.. instead, it’ll be a musical! Right! …with singing gargoyles…” Hello?!) 
Anyway, Michlap’s blog is still new, he just started in April, and there isn’t a great deal posted yet, so you may want to bookmark it and stop back to watch for more. I know I will.

Thomas Eakins

Posted by Charley Parker at 7:47 pm 
 


As a student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts I always felt that the great American painter and teacher Thomas Eakins (pronounced A-kins, with a long a) was a presence there, if a somewhat ghostly one. 
By that I don’t mean that he walked the halls, palette in hand, offering critiques of student cast drawing from beyond the veil; just that his association with the school was as oddly strained in modern times as it was when he was studying, later teaching and eventually the director there in the late 19th Century.
On one hand the Academy of the 20th Century was proud to be associated with Eakins, who was unquestionably one of the greatest American painters; on the other hand there were the, um… controversies, with which the Academy seemed as uncomfortable in the 20th Century as it had been in the 19th, when Eakins was fired from his position for a history of insubordination to the board of directors and “improprieties”, of which the camel-back-breaking straw was the removal of a male model’s loincloth in a class of female art students.
The Academy’s web site, brushes over this whole era with a few words and little mention of controversy. Read enough biographies of Eakins and you will find mention of Eakins as a champion of the importance of the human form in art and an opponent of repressive attitudes toward teaching figure drawing, side by side with stories of rumored improprieties, rudeness, accusations of abuse and possible mental illness. 
Leaving the social drama behind, you will find Eakins’ unswerving commitment to gritty realism, keen draughtsmanship, mastery of painting technique and the revelation of form through value and contrast. His mastery is evident in his portraits, including group portraits of physicians in operating theaters, artists, lawyers, and literary figures (like Walt Whitman, whose portrait by Eakins was said to be his favorite and is still in the collection of the Academy). Eakins was also a master of perspective, as often revealed in his paintings and studies of sculls on the Schuylkill River (image above, with perspective study, inset).
Although his work is highly regarded now, at the time he was something of an outcast from artistic circles. He was apparently very respected by his students, who asked him to carry on teaching after his dismissal from the Academy at drawing sessions arranged by the Philadelphia’s Art Students League.
The sessions were held at what is now the Philadelphia Sketch Club, the nation’s oldest continuing arts organization, which carries on the tradition of life drawing sessions to this day, and over the years has been a great resource for many artists and art students in Philadelphia, including this one.

Sky-Doll in Heavy Metal

Posted by Charley Parker at 9:10 am 
 

For those familiar with Italian comics artist Alessandro Barbucci and writer/colorist  Barbara Canepa there is a special treat in the current (Summer 2006) issue of Heavy Metal Magazine.  
The issue is a special that collects all three of the French comics albums of Barbucci and Canepa’s Sky-Doll series and presents them together, conveniently translated into English. 
If you’re not familiar with Sky-Doll, see my previous post on Barbucci and Canepa.
In addition to Sky-Doll, Barbucci and Canepa are also the artists/writers of the French Witch children’s comics series (from which the American TV series W.I.T.C.H. was adapted) and the delightful Monster Allergy stories (first three issues, I think).
If, like me, you’re a fan of Barbucci and Canepa’s charmingly stylized and wonderfully imaginative comic art, you would be perfectly happy to pay upward of 20 Euros for each of the three French Sky-Doll albums, plus who knows how much for importing and shipping, and be happy to have them in French. To have all three translated in one magazine for $6.95 is an amazing treat. 
(You have to ignore the entirely unrelated cover. What were they thinking? With so much striking Barbucci art available, why… oh, it’s Heavy Metal Magazine… never mind.)
There is still a Sky-Doll album not reprinted here, Sky-Doll: Doll’s Factory (Amazon France link here), which is essentially a “making-of” book, with sketches and penciled pages.
Note: Sky-Doll, Heavy Metal Magazine and some of the sites linked here contain nudity and sexually suggestive images. Avoid them if you’re likely to be offended.
 
Addendum: Hai writes that Barberra and Canepa contributed content to the first six issues of Monster Allergy and supervised the rest. There is new monsterallergy.com web site devoted to the new animated series. I don’t know the degree of B & C’s involvement with development of the show.

Matthew Woodson

Posted by Charley Parker at 8:20 am 
 


I really enjoy the work of young artists, whether still in art school, recently graduated or on their own independent course of learning. There is a particular appeal to that part of an artist’s development when their style and approach has not yet “hardened” into a set path.
Illustrator and comics artist Matthew Woodson is a recent graduate of The School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
His sometimes stark, sometimes poetic images are spare, usually consisting of linework and a few tones of gray or muted color. He works in pen, brush and ink, occasionally with the addition of color in gouache and frequently with color added digitally in Photoshop. 
His subjects are people, often portrayed with unflattering directness and occasionally in compositions that don’t include the head, studies of natural objects like plants and animal skulls, and landscapes. 
His site features comics as well as illustration, including a story called “Tendergrass” that was published in the Flight 2 anthology.
I can’t give you direct links to his site sections because his web site is in frames (for no apparent resaon). His site (and business?) is called “ghostco”, the introductory page for which informs us that most of his work can’t be displayed because of contractual limitations, but promises more in the future. My thought is that his progress will be worth watching.
Link via The Art Blog, which included a “Bonus Link” to Woodson’s “How to Ink Like an Idiot” tutorial on deviantArt.


Site Quirks: Site is in frames. Navigation is from a small, pale menu to the lower right of the page, easy to miss if your browser window is open wide in a high-resolution monitor.

Caspar David Friedrich

Posted by Charley Parker at 9:05 am 
 


“Caspar David Friedrich…”, wrote sculptor Pierre-Jean David d’Angers, “created a new genre: the tragedy of landscape.”
Friedrich attempted to create Christian religious art without the traditional biblical scenes, instead using allegorical landscape to  convey religious themes. In spite of its message of Christian redemption, his work is steeped in loneliness, isolation and desolation, perhaps because of tragedy in childhood. He witnessed his brother drowning in the Baltic after falling through thin ice while attempting to rescue him from the same fate, his mother died when he was 7 and two of his sisters died by the time he was 18. 
His fascination with ruins of churches, graveyards, shipwrecks, isolated individuals among hauntingly portrayed landscapes and mist enshrouded planes populated by bare trees made him a favorite of the Surrealists, who saw him as a visionary painter. 
Similarly, he had a great impact on Symbolist painters like Arnold Böcklin, whose own tragic life and fascination with death undoubtedly found resonance in Friedrich’s silent stones and “haunted, frightened trees” (to borrow a wonderfully appropriate line from Bob Dylan). 
Friedrich started his career doing sepia ink and wash drawings of landscapes; he didn’t take up oil painting until he was 30. In the course of his career he became one of the masters of romantic landscape painting along with Turner and Constable. Toward the end of his life he was crippled by a stroke and, unable to paint in oil, he returned to sepia drawings.
Unfortunately, some of his work was lost, both to fire and to the Allied bombing of Dresden in World War II. We have only photographic records, mostly in black and white, of some of his masterworks, although some have been colorized by modern artists in an attempt to reconstruct their original appearance.

Raphaël Lacoste

Posted by Charley Parker at 2:34 pm 
 


If you, like many people, envision the process of 3-D CGI (Computer Graphics Imaging) as arranging a few wireframe shapes and pressing the “render” button, you may as well say painting is as easy as taking a brush and slapping some color on a canvas.
The same skills of composition, proportion, perspective, color and, yes, drawing, are as important in the creation of a successful CGI image as they are in traditional painting. Yes, it’s possible for an amateur to make an image in a 3-D application without knowing those things, and the results are similar to someone trying to paint without them. I’ve seen enough poorly done amateur CGI, and have worked in 3-D applications myself just enough to have some idea of how important those skills are to a good CGI image.
Raphaël Lacoste is a French matte painter and concept artist now living in Canada. He is also an award-winning art director for high-end games in the Prince of Persia series. He uses a combination of 3-D CGI and 2-D digital painting in Photoshop to create beautifully atmospheric images that are at times evocative of classical and 19th century paintings.
The image above,  Path to the Gothic Choir (large version here), is the subject of a feature article on the CGSociety site that goes into some detail about the process of creating this kind of image, including preliminary sketches, initial renderings, details and an image of a painting by 19th Century German romantic painter Caspar David Fredrich called Cloister Graveyard in the Snow, that was the inspiration for Lacoste’s image.
Lacoste’s own site has a nice selection of his moody and atmospheric matte paintings and concept art, including a wonderful evocation of Arnold Böcklin’s The Isle of the Dead. (See my previous post on Arnold Böcklin.)
There is also a gallery of his work on the CGSociety’s site.

Tim Jessell (update)

Posted by Charley Parker at 7:55 am 
 


I first wrote about illustrator Tim Jessell and his “realistic with a twist” style in this post back in October of 2005. 
Since then, his site has been completely redone and the Portfolio section expanded with larger versions of his editorial and advertising illustrations for the likes of Time Magazine, American Airlines, Nike, Polaroid and Apple Computer. 
Jessell also illustrates children’s books, including the Secrets Of Droon series by Tony Abbott, Superhero Christmas, a children’s book written by Marvel Comics’ Stan Lee, and Amorak, written and illustrated by Jessell (details here).
 His style is at once varied and consistent, changing with his subject but retaining a foundation in realistic painting and solid draftsmanship. Browsing his portfolio, you can find a straightforward portrait next to a fearsome dragon in from the Droon series next to lighthearted children’s fantasy.
His new galleries also feature a display gimmick that I’m a sucker for, showing a “reflection” of each image as if the painting was sitting on a dark reflective floor. The effect is repeated on the gallery thumbnail page and I’ve chosen to use a section of that here, rather than try to choose  a “representative” image among his broad variety of subjects.


Site Quirks: Browsing the portfolio still requires a tedious "click and click back" routine that gets old rapidly when viewing multiple images, but the images themselves are worth the inconvenience. A few of the portfolio thumbnails are not linked to larger images.

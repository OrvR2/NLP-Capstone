[ Print | 

 ]



The role of the Incident Response Department is to insure the rapid and effective response of appropriate resources, as needed, to suppress and extinguish wildfires in Texas. Rapid initial response to wildland fires is essential to suppress wildfires during high fire danger conditions, limit losses and provide for the safety of emergency responders and citizens. The task is to do so in a cost-effective and efficient manner. In addition, TFS is often requested to respond to all-hazard incidents that affect the state. To protect the state from all types of natural and man-made disasters, TFS employees many tools such as the Lone Star State Incident Management Team, Type III Incident Management Teams,  Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid System (TIFMAS) and the National Wildfire Coordinating Group.

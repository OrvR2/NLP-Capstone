As fans of MTV's hit reality show "Jersey Shore" know, Pauly DelVecchio, better known as Pauly D, knows how to dance--or at least properly fist pump. But does that mean the reality star can ever see himself join the ranks of ABC's "Dancing With the Stars?" 
A few weeks ago, Pauly D confessed that he felt a little too famous to go "Dancing." In an interview with our Naughty But Nice Rob, the celebrity DJ said: 
"I will do 'Dancing with the Stars' when my career dips." 
But Thursday night at New York City's Pacha nightclub, Pauly D was singing a different tune. In an interview with The Huffington Post, DelVecchio confessed that he thinks "Dancing With the Stars" is a great opportunity--just not for him. After all, he's too busy making $10k per night DJing. 
"I never said I was too famous for it," said Pauly D. "I like the show. I think it's great. But I just think I'd like to do it a little bit later. Right now I'm on tour with Britney, and I have a lot of other things going on, but it's a great show, though." 
So it looks like fans may still get a chance to see Pauly D bring some Jersey moves to the ballroom dance floor. 
The Shore's resident spiky-haired funnyman is currently working with rapper 50 Cent on a new album, proving that once again, he may be the only "Jersey Shore" housemate to walk out of Seaside Heights with a legitimate career after his 15 minutes of reality fame are up. 
He's also touring with pop princess Britney Spears for six performances on her "Femme Fatale" tour, where the DJ even recently received a special on-stage lap dance from the Femme Fatale herself. 
 "It was so crazy," said Pauly D. "It was probably one of the best things I've ever done. I love being on tour and having my own tour bus. The tour was definitely a success." 
And the complimentary lap dance? 
"That was the best day of my life," replied Seaside's resident DJ. 
DJ Pauly D's next big gig will be a special Fashion's Night Out appearance in New York City--for Kim Kardashian. When Kardashian approached him about doing a set at a Fashion's Night Out event for her New York City DASH store, Pauly D offered waive his usual $40,000 appearance fee as wedding gift--and the fellow reality star wasn't even invited to her wedding.
Now there's a fist pumping Jersey boy with some heart. From playing exhausting overnight sets in Jersey to going on tour with Britney Spears and working on an album with 50 Cent, you can't say that Paul DelVecchio hasn't worked hard for his success.

				HP contributo­r, Rob Shuter, who wrote the headline "Pauly D too good for DWTS," seems to cause (or at least try to create) a lot of trouble for the celebritie­s that reports about and/or interviews­.  Several weeks ago when he wrote about Bethanny Frankel getting her own talk show, he stupidly added comments in the thread bashing her.  Careful, Rob, or your naughtines­s may cause you to have no more access to the famous -- other than Jill Zarin, of course.

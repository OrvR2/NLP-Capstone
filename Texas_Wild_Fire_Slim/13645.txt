Federal assistance
WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama has signed a federal disaster declaration for Texas in the wake of wildfires there, the White House said Friday. The move allows federal funding to be made available to individuals in Bastrop County. The federal aid will supplement state and local recovery efforts. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs.

    BASTROP -- After spending nearly a week wondering whether his home had been destroyed in wildfires sweeping across Central Texas, George Gaydos got the news Saturday: His house was gutted.But Gaydos -- who has been living at a hotel with his wife, two children and father since fleeing the fires nearly a week ago -- still can't return to his neighborhood to see what might be left.Fire crews made progress Saturday fighting the wildfire, but concerns over still-smoldering hotspots have kept thousands of residents, including Gaydos, from returning. Authorities said the Bastrop Complex Fire was 50 percent contained after burning for a week.Tensions flared during a news conference Saturday as some residents shouted questions at county officials, demanding to know when they could return to their homes -- or what remains of them -- in the Bastrop area, about 30 miles east of Austin.Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald said officials hope to get other residents back as soon as possible but didn't know how long that would take.Texas is in the midst of one of its worst wildfire outbreaks in state history. A perilous mix of hot weather, strong winds and a historic drought spawned the Bastrop-area fire. It was the largest of the nearly 190 wildfires that the Texas Forest Service said erupted last week, killing four people, destroying more than 1,700 homes and forcing thousands to evacuate.A wildfire that flared up Thursday along the Brazos River near Lake Whitney and destroyed at least seven houses and many outbuildings was 85 percent contained Saturday. Seventy-four people were still battling the fire, which had burned more than 520 acres, according to the Forest Service.Firefighters can expect hot, dry, windy weather to add to their troubles today, Forest Service spokesman Bill Paxton said.Since Nov. 21, the state has had about 21,600 wildfires that have scorched more than 3.7 million acres, Paxton said.Firefighters have stopped the Bastrop fire's progress, and no blazes are burning outside the containment lines, the Forest Service said.The bad news is that there really is no end in sight, Paxton said. More than 1,350 firefighters were fighting the Bastrop fire and 1,620 utility workers were repairing infrastructure in the area, he said."They are making great headway with all the additional resources that have arrived," Paxton said. "But the drought has killed a lot of the vegetation. Even the drought-resistant trees -- the pines, oaks, the junipers -- are all dying and adding additional fuel. We will be sitting on this until we get some significant precipitation."As Bastrop residents wait, they are staying wherever they can -- makeshift shelters at churches, friends' and relatives' homes, even cars in nearby parking lots."There are some who are actually picking out apartments," said Sean McGahan, pastor of New Beginnings Church in Bastrop. "If you haven't already started, you're probably behind the curve."Gov. Rick Perry's office said families whose homes have been destroyed will receive seven-day hotel vouchers from a nonprofit organization as well as assistance from the state.Staff writer Mitch Mitchell contributed to this report.

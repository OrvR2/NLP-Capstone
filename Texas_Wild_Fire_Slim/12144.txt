Texas Forest Service forest genetics is dedicated to enhancing forest land management by providing tree seedlings that are: hardier, faster growing, higher in end-product value and more resistant to disease.
The Texas Forest Service tree improvement program was the catalyst for organizing the Western Gulf Forest Tree Improvement Program which coordinates tree improvement among government and industry in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Oklahoma.  Current Texas members include Hancock Forest Management, International Paper Company, and Temple-Inland Forest.
Texas Forest Service Tree Improvement Program today, manages 100 acres of seed orchards near Magnolia Springs in Jasper County and continues to manage the Arthur Temple Sr. Research Area.  The genetics lab is located on the College Station Campus of Texas A&M University and is led by WGFTIP Geneticist, Tom Byram.

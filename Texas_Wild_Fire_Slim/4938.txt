Alex welcomes back to the show former federal prosecutor and a former member of the United States House of Representatives from Georgia, Bob Barr, who was the Libertarian Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2008 election.

As we have documented, the anti-pat down bill was derailed in the Texas Senate having unanimously passed the House by 138-0 votes after the Department of Justice sent a letter threatening to impose a no fly zone over Texas and shut down Texas airports. The warning was nothing short of a federal blockade and an act of financial terrorism. But the federal assault was aided by a traitor from within the state, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who only served to amplify the threats made by the DOJ in communicating them to members of the Senate, convincing them them to cave in and forcing the hand of Senator Dan Patrick to withdraw the bill before it could be shot down permanently.

Kurt Nimmo www.infowars.com May 31, 2011 Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who played a pivotal role in sabotaging a bill that would have criminalized TSA groping in the state's airports, has written a letter to Gov. Rick Perry asking for a special session. Only the Governor may call the Legislature into special sessions, unlike other states where the legislature may call itself into session. Dewhurst wants a number of legislative issues taken up in the special session, most notably redistricting and Rep. David Simpson's bill making groping without probable cause a felony. After federal intimidation -- threatening to shut down air traffic in Texas -- Simpson's bill failed to get the two thirds vote necessary. The Western Texas Division US District Attorney's office sent the threatening letter prior to a vote on HB 1937. "The Texas Sam Houston fought for and governed apparently is learning submission," Simpson said after the bill went down in flames." www.lonestarreport.org In response to federal intimidation and meddling in state politics, Alex Jones spearheaded a rally at the capitol in Austin. See his video covering the event below. For more on Dewhurst's effort to sink the bill, see Paul Joseph Watson's Republican Lt. Governor Killed TSA Bill For Obama. www.infowars.com Dewhurst's letter to Perry follows. Dear Governor Perry, Unfortunately, despite the very hard work and determination of the majority of Members of both the House and Senate, the Legislature was unable to <b>...</b>

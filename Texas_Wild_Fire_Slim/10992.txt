Reese Witherspoon was reportedly struck by a car while jogging in Santa Monica this morning.
The accident occurred around 11 a.m. PDT as Witherspoon was jogging in the northbound lanes of Georgina Avenue. According to NBC LA a driver coming down 20th street failed to slow down and struck the actress. 
Law enforcement stated that the driver was apparently an 84-year-old woman, reported TMZ.
The 35-year-old actress was brought to a local hospital, but was later released after being checked for minor injuries. According to People, a representative for the star said that she is now "resting comfortably at home."

				I'm glad she is OK.  I don't want to say an 84 year old woman should not be driving, because I know several that are very capable and responsibl­e drivers.  I do believe that after 80 it's time to check reflexes and vision to be safe.  I don't think that was the problem here.  It sounds like this is not a safe area for walking or running.  Perhaps a ban needs to be placed on that area and people exercising should find a safer area.

				There are a lot of streets with no sidewalks, so one must walk or jog along the side of the street itself. Also, in California­, many of the streets run parallel to the coastline. So a street can be listed as north/sout­h but might actually be going west or east in reality, because the coast of California curves rather drasticall­y. This makes it very confusing! In general, north can mean east and south can mean west in many cases. But if you go on that street for a long time, you'll eventually be north of where you were before because in general it goes north in the long run. It doesn't make sense unless you live in California­.

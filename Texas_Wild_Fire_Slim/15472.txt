L.T.Frog






Learning To Fully Rely On Godâthis
is what âL.T. Frogâ is all about. Just as a piano student cannot become a
concert pianist without daily practice, the Christian requires daily practice
of his or her faith, through Bible study, prayer and daily devotions. We also
learn by being active in church, practicing fellowship with other believers,
and living a godly life. âL.T. Frogâ is a book of devotionals for the beginnerâfor those who want to
learn to rely on God more fully. These devotionals are not for the Biblical
scholar; they are not for the saints who have led a godly life. These are for
people who struggle with issues on a daily basis. They are for ordinary people
who live ordinary lives.In
Christian love, Becky

The Game






The Gameby Amanda DeedMr Jonathon Fordham, the most eligible 
bachelor in Sydney and heir to a noble title in England, treats matters of the 
heart like a game.Living in the 
newly forged Australian Colony in 1844, Jack Fordham buries his past beneath an 
indifferent facade. In spite of his rakish reputation, Jack's dashing smile and 
suave flattery would melt any woman's heart.Any that is, it seems, except for Miss 
Margaret Wingrove.The 
beautiful governess is strangely unmoved by the nonpareil's many attractions, 
nor his beguiling charm. When Meg does not fall into his arms as he presumes she 
will, his game of pursuit begins in earnest.As Meg 
continues to resist his advances, Jack's determination to win her 
intensifies.But can he risk exposing his true heart 
to find the love he desires before his game unravels?And can he embrace, or will he simply 
deny the obstacle which stands between them?her faith?

"Walk The Streets In Anger"






Order It Now! Includes more hits:  "They Change The Rules" and "She Needs Her Country".  A Seven Song CD!!What They're Saying About "Walk The Streets In Anger"WALK THE STREETS IN ANGER This song, written by Anne Harpen, speaks to your soul. I wanted to
share it with you so you could hear it and pass it on. It really speaks to the
disbelief and frustration we each are experiencing as we watch the madness that
is taking place in our Government! Anne is a Patriot for writing this song and
I agree with her. In my humble opinion, this should become our battle song. *****

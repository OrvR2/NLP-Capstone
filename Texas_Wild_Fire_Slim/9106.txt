Did the media ignore lack of applause at Obama’s Navy Yard speech?By Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – 11 hrs ago


Did the news media expose its liberal bias by ignoring a clip of a group of naval officers who needed to be instructed to applaud President Barack Obama? That's what several conservative pundits are asking, after a video of the incident in early August surfaced this week.
As Obama was introduced at the Washington Navy Yard on Aug. 5, he approached the podium to "Hail to the Chief." The assembled officers did not applaud. The senior officer who introduced the president, sensing the awkward silence, said, "You can go ahead and cheer, too." The crowd, some of who were taking photos, dutifully clapped hands.

"Perhaps it's protocol not to cheer until told to when in the military," Ben Howe, a blogger for RedState.com, wrote. "But if that's true, the media has some explaining to do as to why they went after Bush for the same thing in 2005."
Howe is referring to how the national news media covered a similar incident in June of that year, when President George W. Bush gave a speech at Fort Bragg and applause was initiated by a White House staff member.
As Howe noted, Terry Moran, reporting for ABC News, said at the time, "I must tell you that applause was initiated by a member of the White House advance team."
On NBC, Brian Williams said, "Some folks at home no doubt were curious about the lack of applause breaks. By pre-agreement between the White House and Fort Bragg, there was no entry applause as the soldiers were at attention. We were 23 minutes into it before the first break for applause."
"It was my observation that that one applause break was actually triggered by members of the president's advance team," NBC's Kelly O'Donnell told Williams. "They were just a few feet from me. They started to applaud— applause is contagious, and it then swept through the room. There was applause when the president left the room after the speech was over but people in uniform here told me that they had planned to be polite and to follow protocol."
But even if the Naval officers were following protocol, Howe wrote, "it's media bias on display."
"How come that bit of tape isn't by now famous?" Washington Post columnist Erik Wemple asked. "Why hasn't it been chewed over by every cable news outlet in the land?"
Perhaps it's because on Aug. 5, the cable news outlets were focused on the stock market's 513-point plunge.
As The Cutline noted that day, "cable and network news channels scrambled to cover the historic drop, with ABC, NBC and CBS breaking into their afternoon programming to air brief reports after the markets closed, and CNBC and Fox Business--which went commercial-free to cover the close--planning special primetime coverage."

To those who are  disrespectful towards President Obama it will only make him stronger. He who disrespects does not have respect for there self, so you tell me how the party and tea could run this GOD in trust country is it by disrespect. If the debt ceiling was raise there wont be any problem it was raise for the other President many times over but not for this President and if the right side doesn't get rid of the party and tea, you might as well take of the in GOD we trust on the money because this is not trusting in  GOD we are not like other countries. Don't let it end up like that.GOD bless all of his people, the haters, and GOD bless America.

It's a non-issue... stop looking for hype.  Actually, the media doesn't care because they just want something interesting to right about.  As Obama's popularity began to rise in the early stages of his campaign for the presidency, the media could not get enough of him.  When the tide is starting to shift the other direction, as expected with any president, they start to look for any small set back that they can write about.  The media just goes with the flow.  its about whatever polls well.  At the end of the day, the important thing to ask yourself, will he be reelected and the answer is yes.  However, the economy and the jobs situation must have a much rosier outlook.  It doesn't look good for the moment, but even if things don't change much, people will be willing to give him a second chance.  People understand that Bohner and the Tea party are trying to undermine his efforts to improve the economy and they will side with reason rather than hyperbole and mindless ideology.  The flag toting kooks in the backwoods are not going to change the will of the people.  Yes, I'm a liberal and I don't believe in welfare and don't believe in program after program for minorities that do not work and cause us to be dependent on any government.  I don't believe in handouts, but rather a hand up to to make us self sufficient.  I believe in the nuclear family and education should be top priority next to God. As a black man, this is my belief.

I don't know, but it seemed like they wanted to cheer. Lol. If they were upset, they wouldn't be taking pics and stuff. And when asked to cheer I'm sure they would get loud too. Some might say that they cheered because they were instructed to. But if they were upset it would have been a polite applause. 

And I'm tired of this liberal media bias crap. In all it's a good thing, because they get to keep garbage off the air. I mean look at FOX News, that's what it would be like.

Frankly, after 11 years in the Navy and Marines - I know well that the Navy still has a problem with color - even though they - try to hide it.  But they also have a problem with women as well.  They have no problem sleeping with women but they do have a problem respecting them as equal service members.  If any wise ass out there wants to criticize my observations I spent 6 years as a Fleet Petty Officer  and 4 years as a Navy Intelligence Tech assigned to the Pentagon in DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) a Joint Service and Civilian Command. Total time (11 years 1979-91) So that ends that argument.
Now I will be voting for Obama - not because I agree with everyone of his policies - I don't - but because right now him and the Democrats are the only sane people in government.  I like Ron Pauls foreign policy - but I don't like his idea of ending Social Security - that's wrong, no industrial country in the world refuses to give it's citizens a social safety net - this is not 1879 - this is a high-tech post industrial world - and millions upon millions of people are not able to acquire the skills to let them stash a million dollars away to retire on.  
As far as Obama - I wish he had never run in the first place - why?  Because America is a country that has not grown up yet. We haven't even dealt with how the Native Americans were ripped off their land and were treated to genoicide - if you can't deal with that as a nation then it's obvious that the questions of slavery and race are that much more difficult to deal with.  Not to mention the fact that this country can't even deal with the blatant discrimination against women in this society - how dare do a bunch of cruddly Republicans sit around a table and decide to make huge cuts in women's health care?  That is madness.
Look you put the black guy in the White House and all he has become is the whipping boy for the GOP's failed policies and some people's bigotry and lack of education.  I can't believe some of the moronic statements that I read on this blog. This country dug it's grave before Obama was elected to the Senate - his only mistake was trying to be one of the boy's and keeping the troops in these various quagmires. Bush and Cheney opened the door - there has been enough written to see it for yourself if you wanted to. Cheney's book and Bush Jr.'s book should be used at their trials for War Crimes.  In ten years they started a train that got us into about 7 hot wars, a tax break for the rich, a giveaway for big pharmaceuticals, and God knows how many billions of stolen money in Iraq and Afghanistan before Obama even began his run for President. They just found 65 Billion that can't be accounted for from Iraq, and there's ton's more and ton's more stolen in Afghanistan.  And you want to scream at Obama for our financial problems? Obama is just a sucker that makes an easy target. You forget - you invaded a sovereign nation that didn't do a damn thing to you - that 's a war crime, not to mention Cheney wanting to torture every damn body - that's what we hung Nazi's in Nurenburg for at the end of WWII.
The bank bailout - that was Bush - the election hadn't even been held when they gave the bankers all that dough - but once again - you want to blame Obama.  Obama care - I don't like it because it wasn't Leftist enough - but what are you Righties crying about?  It is the Private Sector Insurance Companies dream - he couldn't get Medicare for all because he let you Right Wing Lunatics scare him - so what the hell are you complaining about?  Besides half of you ignoramuses already had Medicare - and you love  - well that is a government program.
Look - all you working class folks who hate Obama - go ahead vote Republican and let Perry end your Social Security and Medicare, and I am going to laugh my butt off - because you hateful - ignorant - bigoted idiots - you always  fall for the trap - you always vote against your own interests to keep someone else down.

When a commanding officer enters a room all military goes to attention.  this is not relaxed until given atease.  thus they won't cheer or clap until released.  proper protocol for military.  seeing as odumbo is the commander and chief of our military by being elected president by a lot of idiots, it remains to him to release the attention.  then the military personnel can clap, cheer, boo, throw shoes etc.  and sence he did not release the men/women from attention.  so it fell upon the second highest rank in the room.  but, i would still not have applauded him.  or maybe it was just their way of telling odumbo how they feel about him.

Cold  controlled applause is expected and silence sometimes results when military men have either much hidden contempt and apprehensions about the leader or of their superiors speaking in front of them.Hooting and echoes of approval usually openly occurs for superiors who are well liked although in a timely controlled manner too .Some media people of today who covers events often believe they are the messiah of truth and who have all the solutions to societies ills. A lot of them have their own biased ideas and self interest, thus betraying the true nature of the job of mediamen in just reporting events as they are or singly as it is in a balanced way.

picture this in your mind, odumbo as a spear chucker, with a loin cloth, those humongo ears, throwing the spear with no aim.  that is how his presidency is running, without a clue as to what to do and just do it without checking into it.  spear chucker odumbo, that is a abetter name for him that just plain odumbo.l

The military does not applaud. It respects the Commander In Chief. Public could learn something from the military. Respect those who have rule over you, especially if you expect your party leader choice to be respected.

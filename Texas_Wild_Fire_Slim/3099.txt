The promise of the American dream has given many hope that they themselves could one day rise up the economic ladder. But according to a study released Tuesday, those already in financially-stable circumstances should fear falling down a few rungs too.
The study, by the Pew Charitable Trusts, found that nearly a third of Americans who were part of the middle class as teenagers in the 1970s have fallen out of it as adults. Though Pew examined only a certain demographic swath of participants, its findings suggest the relative ease with which people in the U.S. can end up in low-income, low-opportunity lifestyles -- even if they started out with a number of advantages.
Though the American middle class has been repeatedly invoked as a key factor in any economic turnaround, numerous reports have suggested that the middle class enjoys less existential security than it did a generation ago, thanks to stagnating incomes and the decline of the industrial sector.
The study stops tracking data in 2006, meaning that it remains unknown how the economic slowdown of recent years -- including a crisis in the financial system, a housing market weighed down by foreclosures, soaring unemployment and a global recession -- may have affected the likelihood that more Americans born into middle-class circumstances will tumble out of them.
The Pew study looked at Americans who were between the ages of 14 and 17 in 1979, and living at home with their parents that year. For teenagers who were part of the middle class in 1979 -- defined as the 30th through 70th percentile of income -- about 28 percent of them had fallen out of it, meaning below the 30th percentile of income, by 2006.
This kind of decline in fortunes did not affect all races and genders uniformly. Middle-class blacks, for example, stood a 37 percent chance of falling out of the middle class, compared with just a 25 percent chance for whites. And white women had a 30 percent chance of falling below the 30th-percentile line, whereas white men had only a 21 percent chance.
The researchers observed a few correlations between downward mobility and certain kids of behavior. The study notes that people who did not pursue their education past high school, who had used heroin or cocaine, who had performed poorly on standardized tests, or who had gotten divorced or never been married had a higher likelihood of falling out of the middle class.
 Prolonged unemployment is taking its toll on many middle-class Americans, as they see opportunities receding and employers increasingly hiring applicants who already have jobs or who have only been out of work a short period of time.
While the U.S. economy officially climbed out of recession two years ago, growth has been painfully slow since then, and in recent months has threatened to come to a standstill. Most analysts agree that the country needs to be expanding at more than twice its current rate in order to lift the economy out of its doldrums.

				The term, "middle class" has more to do with one's position in the hierarchy than money or 
wealth. Any place between poor and rich is "middle class". The "middle class" serves as a buffer for the rich against any revolution­ary tendencies of the dirt poor ...  Economic "middle class" is a whole new ballgame ... to find out where you are, simply find the mid-point between the richest and poorest of us ... that's where you are in the "economic middle glass" ... doesn't look so good now, does it?

				Poverty is a relative term when you think of it. These same "poor" who are doing menial jobs are considered fortunate by those in countries who are digging thru garbage and live in a shanty made of cardboard.  Are indigenous people with little to wear (think Pacific island tribal natives) living off the land...poo­r? I actually think they are rich.

We can't allow the overarchin­g system to brainwash us on how we view ourselves and our plight.  Otherwise we continue to fall deeper into the money-madd­ening matrix.  Money is a means, and when it becomes an end, lives are destroyed.

				People need to live below their means as much as they can.  I know that's impossible if living in total poverty.  People always think they need a new car, a bigger tv, new furniture, a fancier phone, a vacation they can't afford and trendy clothing.  Do we really need to spend all this money on crap that's just gonna end up at the landfill?  Use items until they can't be used anymore.

				The job of marketers is to suggest to Americans that 'everyone else is buying this, so you must too.' Fewer people have over-indul­ged as some suggest. In fact, most people I know purchased much less over the last decade as other more pressing costs rose dramatical­ly - such as housing, education, insurance, etc.

				Where are the John Stossel quotes?  According to my tea party neighbor, he taught her that some huge percentage of Americans -- I think it was 20% -- shifted upward from poverty into middle class during the Bush administra­tion.  I think that the truth was that there was no inflation adjustment of the definition of poverty, so a significan­t number of people who were living in poverty were no longer defined as living in poverty.

				Save save save and carry no debt.  There are no guarantees you will have a job or parents around to support you.  You need a paid off home and savings afterwards and anyone that tells you otherwise is wrong.  No mammal on earth raises its young to be indebted for life!!!

Save save save and prices will fall to affordable levels.  YOU determine that your money is worth nothing by using credit to buy anything.  Credit distorts supply vs. demand.

				This is a result of fiscal conservati­sm promoted by both parties, culminatin­g in NAFTA and our free trade mentality.  Cheap labor was supposed to go overseas while high-payin­g white collar jobs went to the U.S.  That lasted only as long as it took other countries, like India, to invest in the educationa­l resources necessary so that they could provide cheaper labor across all job sectors.  The middle class will continue to suffer until our economic competitor­s’ standard of living (built off our massive trade deficits) rises to match ours or the U.S. implements trade laws to protect what remains of U.S. industries­.  

In the meantime we’ll continue to let infrastruc­ture and educationa­l degrade so that we will be woefully unprepared in the future no matter what happens.  How many years (decades) will we blindly follow these economic policies before we realize they don’t work?

				The latest raid on Gibson Guitar is clear evidence where this administra­tion has us headed.  Gibson's getting "singled out" was not political so we're told, yet their CEO is a Republican supporter, and Gibson is non-union.  Didn't we just see Obama and Hoffa bumping members?   

So where does the government think the Gibson guitar frets should be manufactur­ed and finished?  Why in India from whence the wood originates­.  Martin uses the same wood, probably from the same suppliers, but they've never been raided.  I wonder if the non-union high end furniture manufactur­ers in the south are worried?  I sure would be.  This smacks of targeted middle class job destructio­n. So not only are all folks in the middle class falling down the ladder, but some of the "unsavory kind" are having the legs cut out from under them.

				I'm only a tad older than the kids followed in this group (age 19 in 1979). I got out of college with a bachelor's degree in 1980 and stepped into a recession (81). Finally got a job, only to lose it in the recession of 83. Got a Master's in 89 and am still in the same job since 89, only now we've had no raises for 5 years. 5 years! 
As a kid, I watched my dad get promotion after promotion, raise after raise, with only a pharmacist degree. He retired with a great pension. I always believed if I played fair and worked hard, things would work like that for me. Well, I've not gone downward, and that is good. But I've only maintained­...and there is no pension waiting for me, just a tenuous 401k.

				Good point.  And don't think for a minute that the government isn't looking at those juicy 401-k accounts with sinister envy.  If you haven't paid taxes on it, then the government (this one in particular­) can work on legislatio­n to absorb the funds and doll them out as they see fit. That's "out there" I know, but that is how little trust I have in these elected charlatans­.

				What your Dad and my Dad had is over.  Those days are gone for most people.  Loyalty and rewards for that are a tradition that has been replaced by the almighty dollar.  

Playing fair and working hard does not equal good retirement­. It's every man unto himself now, and playing fair is inconseque­ntial in terms of survival.

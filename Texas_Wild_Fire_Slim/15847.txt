Kyle field @ A&M


                  ******Update******** 9/9/11Just a quick update: I can confirm that a website to purchase the towels online is in the works as we speak for anyone who is unable to get to College Station. We hope to have it up and running by early next week.We are also attempting to work through the possibility of adding a "Donation" option on the same website, where you could donate any additional money to those 2 funds if you would like ...to do so. There are some issues to work out with that.Stay tuned on everything, and PLEASE the most important thing right now is to KEEP SPREADING THE WORD! Keep inviting anyone and everyone you know. As we've seen on the event wall below, people are interested in contributing to the cause even if they aren't Aggies. Thanks!!********Update******** 9/7/11From Aggie_BryanI have a scheduled meeting with CC creations today to discuss the inventory for several options. Our primary goal is to get maroon towels made. I will be meeting with PIKE and several other students\organizations tonight to hammer out the final details after I have spoken with Ken.Several people have expressed that maroon towels may not be seen if OSU is indeed a night game. This is not a concern because the goal is going to be to get everyone to wear a white shirt. The Maroon Towels on a sea of white will look really crisp and clean.In terms of the licensing fee, as of right now it is not a concern. While many people here may be charitable and would be willing to buy a towel without A&M insignia, corporate sponsors (who we hope will help offset the costs of supplies a printing in exchange for a logo on the towel) may not be so charitable if some sort of A&M branding is not on the towel. These issue will be hammered out with CC Creations this morning and we will make the best decision to maximize the profit per towel.As I said yesterday, the money made on every towel sell will be going to the Texas Wildfire Relief and The Red Cross. I have spoken with the organizations and will have further information soon. *********Update 9/6/11 7:30pm**************(this from the Ag that is trying to put this thing together)Ok Ags, Nothing in life is worth doing if it’s easy... right?After making multiple phone calls throughout the day and sending countless emails, we have officially hit a road bump. For those of you who aren’t familiar with the way the university works, here is the scoop. A&M has three MAJOR players when trying to get something like this to happen. There is the Licensing Department that deals with the actual branding of things like A&M logo’s, The Wrecking Crew, etc. This entity controls the price of utilizing A&M logo’s. They have the power to offer a waiver for any merchandise printed for this effort but they have declined the opportunity to do this. If we choose to make towels (or shirts) we will need to include the licensing fee in the price (or find sponsorship to cover the fees).There is the A&M Bookstore who deals with distribution of merchandise on campus. And there is the Sports Properties department. This department decides what the athletic department will endorse. 12th man day last year was headed up by this department. According to the people I have spoken with today, the Licensing dept. will not grant us a waiver for this effort. Additionally, the Sports Properties department has said that they will not be endorsing this. While I don’t agree with their stance, I can understand where they are coming from. If the sports properties dept. were to endorse this event and in two weeks a hurricane were to rip through Galveston are they supposed to endorse an effort to raise money there? What if an Aggie has a brain tumor and asks for endorsement at an event. I feel that they are taking the slippery slope approach and are saving endorsement for other efforts. (I dont agree with this at all)As much as I hate to say it, the perfect storm has presented itself with this SEC realignment news. With the University about to make a huge announcement tomorrow, we are looking at an up hill battle. None of this news necessarily means we can’t make this happen, it just has become a lot more difficult. Everything is going to have to be done in the private sector. I feel that we can still make this happen with the powerful Aggie network, TexAgs, and good ‘ol Aggie determination. I feel logistically, (especially with no endorsement from the university) that it would be a nightmare to print shirts with different sizes AND maroon 12th Man Towels. That being said, Ken Lawson with CC Creations and I have been in contact and he is going to get some pricing and availability for Maroon Towels tomorrow. Once we know the price point and the availability, I will be contacting the various students, individuals, and organizations to get the word spread. This is going take A LOT of work to get done right but I believe we can make it happen. I’ll let you know what the story is tomorrow.(this from the gentleman that is trying to get this whole thing together)*****UPDATE******Hey Ags, Here is the update.The following organizations have been targeted to receive the funds from this effort.The Texas Wildfire Relief http://txwildfirerelief.org/and the American Red Cross of Texas http://www.centex.redcross.orgThe though is that 1/3 of the funds will go to the Texas Wildfire Relief which will benefit Volunteer Firefighters and 2/3 with go to the American Red Cross to benefit those who have lost their homes or lively-hood to the fires.I am waiting to hear from two entities on campus before we finalize the plans. Please know that I am working as fast and as diligently as possible to make this happen. A lot of student organizations are on board with more expressing their interest every minute. If you want to help or want additional information, please PM me or send an email to:aggie.wildfirerelief@gmail.comAlright Ags,Got a project for you. As many of you know, the past several months have been rough. Throughout the state drought has caused many a hard working Texan to fall on rough times.Over the weekend (and earlier this summer) Wildfires wrecked havoc across the state. While it may be fun to think about all of the re-alignment and what it will be like to be in the SEC, we must remember that we are Texans.What we would like to do is 'Towel Out' Kyle field September 24th when OSU comes to visit Aggieland. Instead of the traditional white 12th man towels, we are pushing for white shirts and maroon towels.This is a unique opportunity for us to show the nation and the state that while we may be wanting to leave the conference, we are still TEXANS and we look out for our brethren.If you are interested in supporting this movement, please send an email to:aggie.wildfirerelief@gmail.comIf you have any contacts in the Athletic Department, please e-mail. Thanks!Gig'Em,***********Just to clarify, the money sold from the shirts and towels are going to go to relief funds! **************

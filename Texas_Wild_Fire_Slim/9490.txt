What can I say about a perineal irrigation bottle?, February 18, 2008


By Amy (Oklahoma City)  - See all my reviews


This review is from: Perineal Irrigation Bottle 8 oz, EACH (Health and Beauty)


I certainly won't be giving a video review!  Ha!  My 83 year old mother needed them, and she says they work just fine.  They are a good design for what they are used for.  I received them promptly and had good service.

Great idea, but the plastic is so flimsy that snapping the lid shut basically squashes the bottle and much of the bottle's ingredients are lost in the process.

Every woman should keep one of these on hand. Especially for traveling or when you can't bathe at your leisure. Uses just enough water to give a good wash up and rinse.

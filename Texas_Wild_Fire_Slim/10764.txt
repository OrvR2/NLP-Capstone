David Hilburn running for Brazos County district attorney


Tweet

In 1996, a local attorney discovered his passion for prosecution while working as a file clerk in the Brazos County District Attorney's Office. 
Fifteen years later, David Hilburn, 36, said he's ready to move back into the office, but this time as head boss. 
Hilburn announced his intention to run for Brazos County district attorney amid a group of about 20 supporters gathered in front of Carnegie Library in Downtown Bryan on Monday. 
He decided to seek office after District Attorney Bill Turner stated he would not run for re-election, he said.
Turner has held the position for 28 years, which is the longest period a local elected official has been in their position. 
Hilburn graduated from South Texas College of Law and began practicing law in 2000 as a prosecutor with the Harris County District Attorney's Office in Houston. 
Five years later, he returned to the Brazos County District Attorney's Office as an assistant district attorney for felony and juvenile cases.
After working for nearly a decade to lock up defendants, Hilburn changed gears in 2010 when he became a criminal defense lawyer with the law office of James and Reynolds. 
He said "switching sides" gave him a new perspective on the justice system and helped him gain better understanding of the effect it has on individuals going through criminal procedures.
As a district attorney, Hilburn said, he would take a "common sense" approach to prosecuting people while remaining tough on violent or repeat offenders. 
The father of two said protecting his family and community from violence is his priority, but he also realizes there are people who make mistakes and deserve second chances. 
"It's about tempering justice with mercy," he said. "Every case is different, every defendant is different."
So far, Hilburn is the only person to announce plans to run for the seat.
In his resignation letter, Turner indicated Jarvis Parsons, chief prosecutor for the 272nd District Court, would be filing as a candidate. 
Parsons didn't deny or confirm plans to enter the race, but said that he would be making a formal announcement about the decision next week.

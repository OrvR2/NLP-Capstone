A kind word I received today.
Sep 9, 2011 | Share
"Huke, bought your cd today and i think it is after Israel Nash gripka in 2009, Dylan leblanc in 2010, the sensation of 2011. A very good cd with great lyrics and sublime musical framing. I will enjoy this record very much in the last months of 2011 and very well be in the years to come."

Thanks Arjan and everyone else who enjoys my music. I consider you all Friends rather than "Fans". I hope to see all my friends soon!

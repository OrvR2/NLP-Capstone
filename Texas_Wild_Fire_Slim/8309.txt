Brazil plans to start removing troops from HaitiAP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011





BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Brazil wants to gradually reduce its peacekeeping force in Haiti, the government said Tuesday.Defense Minister Celso Amorim told BBC Brasil that keeping the troops in Haiti will not benefit the poor country in the long term. His comments were confirmed by the Defense Ministry's press office, which said there is no timetable to begin the troop withdrawal.Brazil leads the U.N. peacekeeping mission sent to the Caribbean country in 2004 after a revolt toppled former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The U.N. troops also were key after a devastating earthquake hit the nation in 2010.The U.N. mission, which was always intended to be temporary, currently has more than 12,000 troops or police in Haiti."We have to be responsible in relation to Haiti and in relation to ourselves," Amorim said in the interview with BBC Brasil. "But in the medium and long term, it's not good for Haiti or for those who are there to have the troops stay forever."He said there is a need to avoid a feeling of false security in Haiti because of the presence of the troops.Amorim made it clear, though, that the withdrawal needs to be coordinated with the U.N. and the other nations currently in Haiti to avoid creating another chaotic situation.He noted that Haiti has held two consecutive elections, showing that the democracy appeared to be consolidated.Amorim was Brazil's foreign minister in the two terms of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who left office last year. He took over the defense ministry position after Nelson Jobim resigned last month.

Let all foreign troops leave that AIDS infested voodoo island, and let them devour one another alive, as those with melanin overload are so fond of doing.

Seems smart on the behalf of Brasil.  The US is trying to "prop up" every other country to no avail.  Bring our troops home too.  We aren't the world police!!

Even Brazil realizes you can only offer a handout or a handup for long before it becomes an entitlement and a demanded handout. Stop sending food and medical supplies to Africa. Its time to let them fend for themselves so they will fish.

Haiti is a waste of the world's resources.  They will never learn, never educate themselves and will always be the poorest, and only predominantly black, nation in the western hemisphere.

Since 2004! That's way to long to be called peace keeping. When you're in a country for longer than 2-3 yrs you're close to being an occupying presence. Brazil pack up and go home. Haitians have got to stand up on their own. If they can't keep the peace among themselves shame on them. When you want peace stand up for it. Other wise just have at it and leave foreigners out of it. Help yourselves haitian people.

After 7 years of "Peacekeepers" a country is either peaceful or not.  If they are not, it is a waste of money to try to make them peaceful.

Man, you people learn lessons the hard way... Hurricanes, wild fires, earthquakes, not to mention tornados galore... Do not make fun of other people's misery. Yours in on the way big time.

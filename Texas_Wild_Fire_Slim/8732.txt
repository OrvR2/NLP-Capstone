Harley should stick to U.S. manufacturing forget about india plant & stay a US Icon !
Customers like myself will not buy a indian made Harley ! This is a majority feeling within biker community ! It's a slap in the face to its 100 year + clientele ! Nothing wrong with downsizing a little to keep co. solvent to = demand ! It will be a national travesty for Harley to lose its integrity ! by outsourceing its production of bikes or parts !

During the Republican primary debate Wednesday night, Jon Huntsman was called out for his comment that the GOP is at risk of becoming the "anti-science party."
"Your chief political adviser has been quoted very prominently as describing the Republican Party as 'a bunch of cranks,' and said your opponents on the stage 'make a buffet of crazy and inane comments.' I'm sure that's insulting to some of these people up here, moderator John Harris said. "Who on this stage is anti-science?"
Huntsman declined to name exactly which of his opponents were making anti-science comments, but he did lament individuals who are questioning evolution and climate change:
"When you make comments that fly in the face of what 98 out of 100 climate scientists have said, when you call to question evolution, all I'm saying is that in order for the Republican Party to win, we can't run from science," Huntsman said.
"We can't run from mainstream conservative philosophy."
Rick Perry is someone who has questioned the scientific consensus on both climate change and evolution.
"I do believe the science is not settled on this," he reiterated when asked about climate change tonight. He compared climate skeptics to Galileo, saying, "Galileo was outnumbered for a spell" -- even though in that case, Galileo was the scientist facing skeptics.

				Here's a funny. Huntsman is farther right than Reagan was...
some RINO. 

It's just that he can't speak in sound bytes, and lots of folks are simply too lazy to listen,... then think.
He's a parrot's nightmare. 
He's a "Democrat"
Buffet is a "Socialist­"
Poor folks are "Raccoons"
Will somebody PLEASE buy these folks a dictionary­? I assume they can read?

				Rick Perry knows if he is to continue to be the Tea Party Flavor of the Month - he has to say global warming and climate change is a hoax. To do otherwise, would make the corporate oil masters angry and then they will pull on those puppet strings really hard.And if you think Perry walks funny now - having those strings pulled too tight will really make him walk funny.

				Perry is right to the extent that science never should settle into dogma or a blind respect for authority and everything is open to debate, but it is impossible to believe he is saying this out of the slightest concern for the scientific method. His is a political stance, nothing more, nothing less. Thanks to Jon Hunstman for the simple act of making sense in this clichéd debate.

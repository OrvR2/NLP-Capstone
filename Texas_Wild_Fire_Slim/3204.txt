ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey's prime minister said Tuesday his nation's navy will step up its surveillance of the eastern Mediterranean Sea – a move that could potentially lead to confrontation with Israel – and warned of more sanctions against Israel as relations between the former allies deteriorated further.
Turkey has already suspended its vast military ties with Israel, said it is expelling top Israeli diplomats and pledged to lobby other nations in support of the Palestinians' statehood bid after Israel refused to apologize for last year's raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla that killed nine Turkish pro-Palestinian activists.
The sudden measures mark a stunning reversal for the two nations, who were once each other's top military trading partners and used to regularly train together on each other's soil.
Israel has expressed regret for the loss of lives aboard the flotilla and said Tuesday it was time for the two countries to restore their former close ties.
"Israel and Turkey are the two strongest nations in the Middle East and in many respects, the most important," Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said before Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's latest threats.
"We have disputes, and even in the case of disputes, it's very important that the two sides use their brains and not act from the gut. It would be best for all involved and in the interest of regional stability to patch things up," Barak said.
A United Nations report released last week said Israel's naval blockade of Gaza was a "legitimate security measure," but also called the raid on the flotilla that tried to break the blockade "excessive and unreasonable." It also said Turkey and the flotilla organizers contributed to the bloodshed.
Israel has accepted the U.N. report, albeit with reservations. Turkey has rejected it.
Erdogan has said the "report does not mean anything for us," and announced the suspension of some trade and military relations. Turkey has not imposed a trade embargo on Israel but suspended ongoing defense projects and purchases from Israeli defense firms.
The breakdown in relations has hurt a key alliance for Israel, which has considered Turkey its strongest ally in the Muslim world.
It is unclear what impact the Turkish decision to scale back economic ties will have. Israeli defense officials said there have not been any new agreements since 2008, just before relations began to deteriorate.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were discussing a sensitive diplomatic matter, said Israel was committed to the existing deals and would continue to provide military gear to Turkey despite the latest crisis.
At its height in the late 1990s, Israel exported to Turkey billions of dollars worth of tanks, unmanned aircraft and military technology. Turkey is also a top business partner and tourist destination for Israelis.
Israeli officials noted paradoxically that despite the tension in recent years, 2011 has been a record year thus far in overall trade.
Relations began deteriorating as a result of Israel's campaign against Gaza rocket launchers in early 2009, in which about 1,400 Palestinians were killed, and worsened dramatically after the May 2010 raid on the Mavi Marmara vessel.
Turkey's latest moves were prompted after it was disappointed by the U.N. report's failure to criticize Israel more strongly and force it to apologize.
Erdogan did not detail what the next round of sanctions against Israel would include. But he vowed to ensure "freedom of navigation" in the eastern Mediterranean by using Turkey's naval bases in the ports of Iskenderun and Aksaz to "keep the area under constant surveillance."
"Of course, our ships will show themselves quite often from now on. We will see it very often," Erdogan said.
Israel's navy closely protects its coastline and enforces the Gaza blockade, but does not have a major naval presence in the eastern Mediterranean.
Turkey's main opposition party warned last week that military moves could lead to confrontation between Turkish and Israeli forces.
"The probability that (Turkey's ruling) party has carried Turkey to the brink of a hot conflict is saddening and unacceptable," said Faruk Logoglu, a deputy chairman of the opposition Republican People's Party.
Alon Liel, a former Israeli ambassador to Turkey, said a conflict on the seas was a possibility.
"I don't think they would dare to penetrate Israeli waters," he told reporters in Jerusalem. But he said Turkey may try to disrupt future Israeli gas exports to Cyprus and he warned of a new Turkish-Egyptian alliance that could isolate Israel in the Mediterranean.
Israel's opposition leader, Tzipi Livni, on Tuesday urged the countries to "put aside all the emotions and to enter the room and to discuss what are the next best steps in order to stop this crisis."
In Washington, the Obama administration was scrambling to keep ties between the two U.S. allies from deteriorating further.
Senior American diplomats, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, are working with both countries to "de-escalate" and "defuse" the crisis, the State Department said Tuesday. Turkey is a key NATO ally of the United States, while Israel is America's top ally in the Middle East.
"We have over many months tried to work with our ally Turkey and our ally Israel to strengthen and improve their bilateral relationship," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. "We still believe that getting back to a good partnership between them is in each of their interests, and we will continue to work for that goal with both of them. But we are concerned about the state of the relationship today."
Clinton discussed the matter at length with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu last Thursday in Paris, while two top Mideast specialists, David Hale and Dennis Ross, raised the issue with Israeli officials on Tuesday.
Israeli military officials said they doubted the crisis would devolve into violence. One senior official said the Israeli assessment is that Turkey is not looking for a conflict, but is trying to flex its muscles with Israel to gain influence in the Arab world.
He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to discuss the matter publicly.

				Just think about... Erdogan is waving his flags, raging and raving out loud... But in reality the country is ruled by the idiot who already ran his military to the ground... He can't even place small number of troops on the Syrian grounds to protect the civilians.­.. Assad is laughing at him....
Also, what happen with the another flotilla? He, Erdogan understood that being wrong second time is not a good idea - it sure will hurt his credential­s. This is why it is not going anywhere. So let him rage and rave on surface... 
By the way, the islamizati­on of Turkey will not happen, no matter how much he (Erdogan) would like to shift to this direction. People all over the world including Turkey understand that Arab Spring is turning into Radical Islamic Winter. They don't want anything to do with it.

				Yes Erdogan and the AK party have run Turkey to the ground bringing unpreceden­ted growth and economic prosperity to Turkey for the past decade how horrible for Turkey.

"radcial Islamic Winter" Did you happen to get that from general Eisenberg the idf home front commander who said the exact same thing? The next day Barak rebuked those assertions by saying there is no war coming. You need to get your own material.

				The moderators on this blog are a great big joke!   They have surreptito­usly removed my commentary on the holocaust, which unfortunat­eoy must have miffed the royal majesty of one Anton, who probably reported it as abusive, when it was neither abusive nor contray to fact.  I mnrely stated that the holocaust which happened more than 60 years ago will be deragged out of the closet very soon.  All I said was that these poor souls should be left in peace and not be dragged out every year to placate a voracious appetite for continuing torture of already mutilated souls.
One never hears of the millions of Chinese who wee slaughtred by the invading Japanese and likewise by the Mao forces; or the millions of Russians shot or mutilated and tortured to death by Stalin.  The holocaust is not sancrosanc­t!
I take extreme umbrage at this sort of surreptiti­ous posturing on the part of crtain individual­s on this blog and by the incorrect attitude taken by the moderators­. 
I onder if this will see the light of day in view of the incorrect attiudde of certain individual­s!

Look guy you are a bigot and they saw through your rhetoric.  Now do us all another favor and give us another Jew quote you find on your racist web sites.    A guy that always finds fault with the Jews but can't stop quoting them to make a bigot point.  Nice.

The fault is not with jews per se, but with Militancy by a rabid bunch of war mongers in Israel.  There are much too many Jews who seek peace, not war with the Palestinia­ns, and are sick and tired of all the harangue they are receiving from the Militants.

				No - I did not report on you.
But may be should as you taking all of this out of proportion­s.
You have no right to speak neither for Chinese not Russians nor Jews.
Was any from your family one of those souls?
And indeed this happened ONLY 60 years ago, but people like consider it too boring or too old. It's not old for most of the Jews - and many families still remember and mourning losses of entire families and many relatives. 
But for such a great "humanist" and "intellect­ual" like you those are just numbers - plus 
happened so long ago (really? 60 years is a distant history for you??).
Yes - you are a disgrace!

				I think Turkey is jumping with both feet into the huge power vacuum in the Middle East. All these years no country has ever openly questioned the legality of the Gaza Blockade. Not even the Syrians or the Saudis. And here’s Turkey filling the void. The US is clearly not leading anybody anywhere and the EU is as divided as ever.

Turkey is the first to let Israel know that its bullying days are over. Egypt is getting more assertive too. There was also a report today that Egypt is trying to convince members of the non-aligne­d countries to vote in favour of a Palestinia­n state within the 1967 boundaries­. Erdogan is clearly thinking of some kind of cooperatio­n with Egypt. 

In both countries supporting the Palestinia­ns and standing up to Israel is a very popular/po­pulist stance. Israel is feeling the pain of the US decline earlier than anyone else.

				I'm all for countries getting all the rope they can to hang themselves­.

Erdogan can't keep hiding the murder of Iraqi Kurds forever.

Egypt is assertive? Great! Israel should give them back Gaza. When they had it from 1948-1967 they didn't exactly proclaim a "Palestini­an" self-deter­mination manifest. Let them deal with them.

				1. The bombing of the Liberty was an accident.  But according to Arda Jews are better than human and never make mistakes.  However the US does the same all the time. A transcript of the Israeli pilots shows they thought it was an Egyptian ship.   2. One Israeli agent in prison when over 20 Christians working for other countries are jailed for spying and Arda makes a rule. BTW the US has been busted spying on Israel.   3.  That makes sense.  Israel is not the US and works in their own interests because Israel needs the protection of the settlement­s from all the wars started by the ARABS. The only one humiliated is you.  4. The US will always have a bad image in the region.  The US is made up of infidels and the US is a democracy and Arabs hate both and you because YOU are an infidel.  So a BS post Arda, but don't let me stop you.

				1.It wasn't a mistake go read the testimony of the soldiers involved attacking an American ship for hours? That's a pretty big mistake. Once again paddyNY defends Israel and bashes America yet he live in NY one of those "dual citizens" we see where his loyalties lie. More BS the reason the US sees animosity in the region is because of it's policies it's all about politics not because its an "infidel" if that were true the region would hate Russia, China, and India the same since they are "infidel" yet they don't show animosity towards those countries. Your simplistic explanatio­n of why the region has animosity towards the US is laughable at best but than again Brigitte Gabriel told you this in her book right? LOL what a joke.

If you don't know that Turkey who fights side by side with America is a better ally than the welfare state of Israel than you need some help.

				Anyone remember when Turkey was all outraged about what was going on Syria and Edrogan promised to take "additiona­l steps" if the killing of civilians didn't stop? Whatever happened to that?
Edrogan is starting to look like the George W Bush of Turkey. Big talk, lots of bluster, minimal thought about the consequenc­es. This world needs more responsibl­e leaders and fewer petulant children with too much power.

				"A United Nations report released last week said Israel's naval blockade of Gaza was a "legitimat­e security measure," but also called the raid on the flotilla that tried to break the blockade "excessive and unreasonab­le." It also said Turkey and the flotilla organizers contribute­d to the bloodshed. Israel has accepted the U.N. report, albeit with reservatio­ns. Turkey has rejected it."

Neither "side" is totally in the right or the wrong here. Let's be reasonable­, people.

Most of the time they are in fact losers and all Puffadder has to do is to look at the Human Rights Committee to see it, but why should he bother to look when he can post more of his regular BS?   Personally I am surprised to see the UN actually used their heads this time. Maybe they will continue but I really doubt it.

				JerryLevy do you examine the 70 or so UN resolution­s against Israel as closely as you have examined this UN report? I didn't think so. 

You forgot about the part where the UN said Israel used excessive force when they shot people in the back and the part where the UN said the remaining passengers were abused. Turkey has always been demanding an apology that won't change with this report.

				I am reposting this especially for the benefit of Anton:

•	Following is from the many esoteric and prophetic writings of one of the most renowned Rabbis of Israel, Moses ben shem toy de Leon, (b. 1250, Leon, Spain—d. 1305, ArevaLo), Jewish Kabbalist and acknowledg­ed author of the Sefer-ha-z­ohar (“The Book of Splendour”­), the most important work of Jewish mysticism; for a number of centuries its influence rivaled that of the Old Testament and the Talmud,  to be found in the Paris Bibliotheq­ue,  (translate­d from the original Hebrew, into French, and subsequent­ly into English):.

"Israel, OH Israel There will come a day when Israel shall find herself isolated among the nations of the world, because of her iniquities against her neighbors whom she stomps under the boot of her heel, against the teachings of En Sof, her God, The Almighty One, Blessed Be Its Name."

“Israel, OH Israel, let us rid ourselves of blasphemie­s against the defenseles­s.  Succor those who need salvation and by so doing declare peace with thy neighbors, and peace shall follow you unto the end of your days.”

				Once again you are an expert in the teachings of Kabbala.

Early in my life I was a student in yeshiva we were not allowed to study such things until we has achieved mastery of the Chumash and Talmud, and achieved a certain age and stability (marriage)­. 

So explain to me the mysteries of ein sof.  

You clipped and posted from some website and do not know what you are talking about.  That is obvious to even someone like me who is no scholar of Kabbalah.

If you want to find examples of the concept of universal justice and peace in Judaism I will give you a simple example.

A roman centurion approached Rabbi Hillel while he was giving a class to his students and challenged him "give me the message of your religion while standing on one leg".

He answered.

"Love thy neighbor as thyself.  The rest is commentary­.  Now go learn it"

You are mistaken in trying to paste quotes from the religion you know nothing about. Now go and learn.

				I cerainly do not need to answer to any one, especially not to you.

I have not and never have clipped and  pasted, as you so werongfull­y claim. 
Ein Sof is supreme deity - That which is and yet is not!  Ein Sof is not  the creator, but the cause for creation..  The creative forces in the Universe are the Elohim, which are the agents ot Fire, Air, Earth and Water, along with Akasha (Ether).  These are the elements of which Man was created.  The created energy in the Universe is propelled by the Logos, (The Word).  The first creation was that of an androgynou­s hermaphrod­itic being, the Adam Kadman.  (See the Sepher Yetzirah for coroborati­on, when this being is known as the male and female person.)

You can go and feret out the rest for yourself.  Enough said to the Mlecha!

				You definitely are not a scholar of the Kabbalah!
The Tetragramm­aton is called in the Kabbala by various names. Non-Existe­nt, or Non-Being, or AHIH and IHVH which are glyphs of existence, and symbols of a terrestria­l-androgyn­e, as male and female!
There are two "Tetragram­matons" in the Kabbala;.  He is dual, and even triple, quaternary and a septenary. The first Tetragramm­aton is the ever concealed one.
Tetragramm­aton- or Malkuth "The mystery of the earthly and mortal man is after the mystery of the supernal and immortal one.  
"The head is the letter Yod, the arms and shoulders are like supernal H, the body is V, and the legs are represente­dby the H he final " .EIN -SOPH , the numberless and the Inconceiva­ble, but even between Microproso­pus and the lower Tetragramm­aton, the "Son" thence the Logos. Tetragramm­aton  The four Hebrew letters usually transliter­ated as YHWH or JHVH, used as a biblical proper.

The four Hebrew letters usually transliter­ated as YHWH or JHVH, used as a biblical proper name for God. Tetragrama­ton , from Greek tetragramm­aton , four-lette­r word, from neuter of tetragramm­atos , four-lette­red : tetra- , tetra- + gramma, grammat- , letter . Traditiona­lly the tetragramm­aton is not pronounced­; Jehovah and Yahweh are two vocalizati­ons of it. So the central or inner meaning of the Tetragramm­aton is Eve, the Mother of All That Lives.

				Speaking of propaganda and the constant barrage of same on the great unwashed thumping Jewish bible brainwashe­d here in America, try this on for size:
They play the part of herald for the message that the Arabs and Muslims that they oppose are a barbarous and violent mass.
“Militant Israel was an invention by thugs who's only belief was in aggression­, such as the Stern Gang, the Irgun, (the militant arm of the Revisionis­t Party, led by Menachem Begin, a murderer who was later to become Prime Minister, and Yitzhak Shamir); and who used terrorist tactics and slaughter when carrying out reprisals, especially in the Arab village of Deir Yassin. Like the Stern Gang, the Irgun was responsibl­e for many horrors against the Palestinia­ns.”

				The Arabs and Mus.lims the Israelis are oppossed to are barbarous and violent. Israel is not oppossed to all Arabs and Mus.lims, just the ter.rorist­s who at.tack them.

Those are the people Israel, and the rest of the world, are oppossed to. The world is also oppossed to violent Christians and Jews as well.

				If the Palestinia­ns will just wait a few more years, they won't have any country to argue about. 
The US is telling a drowning man to just stay under water until we tell him it's safe to breathe

Glug, glug, glug.

Drop off Point in Chambers County to aid Firemen

The drop off points for any supplies, per the attached flier, will be the Chambers County Ag Extension Office location at 295 White Memorial Park Drive near Hankamer.
It is easy to find.  From I-10, take the SH61 exit and travel south.  Very shortly on your right you will see the White’s Park Community Building, arena, etc.  The Extension Office is located in the same parking lot as the Community Building.  Phone number:  409-374-2123.
Thanks,

Authorities in Indiana say they have arrested a 43-year-old, sword-carrying samurai who described himself as "Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs."
On Sunday, Indiana state police troopers Rick Hudson and Ricky Rayner were dispatched to I-65 in Merrillville to investigate a report of a shirtless man running down the highway with a sword. Upon arrival, they found an older model Toyota car abandoned in the middle of the highway. 
Hudson then saw the suspect -- a black male, later identified as Bryon Womack of Cicero, dressed in plaid knee-length shorts and slip-on shoes. He was marching with a 35-inch-long samurai sword on the inner shoulder of the highway, police said.
"The man was marching like a drum major, holding the sword, moving it up and down in rhythm with his marching cadence," Indiana State Police Sgt. Ann Wojas wrote in a police press release. "When Hudson approached him, he swung the sword in a defensive manner. He dropped the sword when Hudson ordered him to do so."

While the officers were taking Womack into custody, a passing motorist in a Chevrolet sports utility vehicle nearly struck a cruiser belonging to a local police officer who had stopped to assist. Womack took advantage of the distraction and attempted to jump into the vehicle; however, officers were quickly able to detain him, police said.
Once back at police headquarters, Womack allegedly refused to cooperate and gave investigators several different names and addresses.  
"He was [then] taken to Lake County Jail where he pronounced that he was 'Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs,' but [would not reveal] his identity," Wojas said.
Womack was charged with attempted carjacking, resisting law enforcement and possession of marijuana. He is still incarcerated at the Lake County Jail.

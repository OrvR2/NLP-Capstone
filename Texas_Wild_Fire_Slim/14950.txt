Chuck Tomlin uses a shovel to stop a fire in the backyard of a home in Bastrop's Tahitian Village neighborhood on Monday. Tomlin volunteered to knock down flames that were just a few feet from the house of a neighbor he had never met. About 40 square miles have burned in Bastrop.

Flames creep toward a house in Bastrop's Tahitian Village neighborhood Monday.  Planes later dumped fire retardant on the home, which was still standing mid-Monday. Nearly 500 homes in Bastrop had been destroyed.

Firefighters battled raging wildfires across Central Texas for a second day Monday as wind-driven flames continued their relentless march through hundreds of homes and across thousands of acres.With most homeowners unable to survey their property, the scope of the disaster — perhaps the worst of its kind in the region's history — was not fully known by late Monday as officials struggled to provide a complete count of the number of lost structures.Their efforts to reach a tally also were hindered as new fires continued to break out throughout the evening.No one had been seriously injured.But in hard-hit Bastrop County, about 30 miles southeast of Austin, authorities raised early estimates of the number of destroyed homes from 300 to nearly 500.Fires that had already blackened 25,000 acres — about 40 square miles  — also continued to threaten even more homes there, and officials deemed it too dangerous for residents to return to still-smoldering neighborhoods.In Travis County, a 125-acre fire in Steiner Ranch near Lake Travis destroyed 23 homes and damaged another 20 and was still burning into the night; another fire in western Travis County destroyed more than 60 homes, according to authorities.Anxious residents there also were not allowed to see what remained of their homes.Speaking at a news conference at the Bastrop Convention and Exhibit Center, Gov. Rick Perry described the disaster as "a monstrous storm of smoke and fire."Perry said he has seen the aftermath of wildfires but that "this one is as mean-looking as I've ever seen.""We will pick up the pieces. We will rebuild," he said.Perry said he also would seek a major disaster declaration from the federal government.A spokesman for Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, said that Federal Emergency Management Agency officials will be on the ground in Central Texas this morning.As Perry returned to his home state from the presidential campaign trail, fires that had started a day earlier continued burning in at least two Central Texas counties.But the day also brought a burst of new flames, including a fire near Leander that led to the evacuation of 500 people and burned 300 acres and at least 13  homes in the Mason Creek and Crystal Falls subdivisions.Throughout the area, as blazes bore down on some of their homes, panicked residents reported scooping up what they could — clothes, wedding photos and heirloom jewelry — and fleeing harm's way.Some told harrowing stories of driving through clouds of smoke and watching in their rearview mirrors as flames overtook their homes.Others refused to leave, grabbing garden hoses or using water-filled buckets to try to stave off flames.Brian Covish, who has lived in his Bastrop County home for 12 years, evacuated about 1 p.m. as he saw fire in the distance but later turned back because he thought it was safe. But as flames neared, he climbed to the roof of his single-story home, waved his arms and summoned a helicopter to dump a flame retardant on it."They saved my house, no doubt about it," he said.With winds still blustery and the humidity low, authorities again Monday pressed residents to use caution as they returned to work and school today  from the Labor Day weekend, saying that the region remains at high risk for a third consecutive day.Retired Austin Assistant Fire Chief Kevin Baum, who studied the city's wildfire risk about eight years ago, likened the danger to "sleeping with a stick of wet dynamite.""We've had some pretty epic wildfires over the years, but what is different today is that we have urban sprawl that is intermingled with wildland vegetation," he said.Lake Travis Fire Rescue Chief Jim Linardos added: "The entire state, especially Central Texas, is under siege right now. We are going to do the best we can. That's the only promise I can make."Bastrop CountyBy Monday night, firefighters in Bastrop County were battling two blazes, including the fire that had been burning for more than 24 hours.That blaze was near the Tahitian Village neighborhood off Texas 71 southeast of Bastrop.A second fire erupted Monday afternoon along Union Chapel Road near Cedar Creek High School, also along Texas 71. The fire prompted the evacuation of Cedar Creek's Capital  of Texas Zoo and an unknown number of homes.

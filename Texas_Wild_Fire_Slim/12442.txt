Teen arsonists sought over Texas wildfire  



Police in Texas were hunting three teenagers after a wildfire caused $1.4 million in damage in an Austin suburb, officials said. 

The blaze destroyed nearly a dozen homes and caused the evacuations of 500 people in Leander, according to residents and media reports. Investigators were treating the wildfire as arson.

 April 30, 2011— PEARLAND, Texas — With a firm grasp on their shovels, Texas Forest Service Director Tom Boggus and seven fellow tree aficionados ceremoniously piled mulch around the base of a newly-planted tree on Friday, formalizing the celebration of Arbor Day.Dozens of local and state officials gathered Friday at Southdown Park in Pearland for the 122nd State Arbor Day celebration. In addition to the tree planting, several awards and recognitions were presented and state and local proclamations were read during the ceremony.“This is a beautiful park,” Boggus said, gesturing to his surroundings as he kicked off the festivities. “You can tell Pearland cares about trees.”First observed in Texas in 1889, Arbor Day celebrates the planting and nurturing of trees, as well as all the ways that trees enrich our lives. The annual state celebration is held in a different city each year.Representatives from various organizations —Texas Forest Service, City of Pearland, International Society of Arboriculture, Texas Forestry Association, Texas Society of American Foresters, Keep Texas Beautiful, Texas Urban Forestry Council and the Houston Area Urban Forestry Council — attended the 11 a.m. ceremony, as did several school children.Several speakers talked about the importance of trees and the benefits they provide to everyone. “No matter where we live, we all have one commonality — and that is trees,” Texas Forestry Association Program Director Susan Stutts said, as she detailed just a few of the hundreds of benefits that trees provide. “You don’t have to stand in the middle of the woods to be surrounded by the forest.”Speakers also noted that the act of planting a tree was selfless because often the benefits often aren’t realized by the planter, but by future generations.“In today’s world where selfish acts are unfortunately commonplace, the planting of trees is truly the opposite,” said Jim Carse, a forester with Texas Forest Service and past president with the Texas Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture.AWARDSCommunity Volunteer AwardMarjorie Wilcoxson, Keep Pearland Beautiful, Pearland Parks Board MemberTree City USAPearland again was named a Tree City USAState Tree Planting AwardsProfessional Category1st Place: Bio Landscape and Maintenance, Jon Richards2nd Place: Asplundh Tree Expert Company, Jeff Vining3rd Place: Lewis Tree Service, Juan MosquedaAmateur1st Place: University of Florida-Houston Alumni, Mark Williams and Jeff LaCroix2nd Place: Sam Houston State-Houston Alumni, Dr. Susan Lenamon3rd Place: Louisiana State University-Houston Alumni, Joe WesleyYouth 1st Place: MacArthur High School2nd Place: Memorial High School Outreach (MOB)Texas Arbor Day Poster ContestState Winner: Katherine Simpers, Fredonia Elementary, NacogdochesLocal Winner: Katie Gyomlai, Jamison Middle School, PearlandTree Line USA UtilitiesOncor Electric DeliveryGarland Power and LightCenterPoint EnergyTo see all the Arbor Day 2011 photos, visit the Texas Forest Service facebook page.###Contact:Mickey Merritt, Bayou Region Urban Forester 713-688-8931 office, 832-260-5866 cell, mmerritt@tfs.tamu.eduWriter: Holly Huffman, Communications Specialist979-458-6605 office, 979-324-0708 cell, hhuffman@tfs.tamu.edu

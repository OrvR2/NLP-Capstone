 Austin Post's City Tax Tool uses your tax assessment values on your property (property taxes) to break down how the city property tax you pay is spent. We divide the Austin tax budget into spending categories, and use your personal property tax assessment to tell you exactly how much you're spending for each of the city services. You can even enter other values for property taxes  just to play around with the tool and find out how much of each tax assessment is being spent in very specific categories.

Daily Horoscope for September 15

 Aries
The Moon and Mars combine to create passion in your life, but don't let little things make you angry, as there is so much to be pleased about today. Venus enters Libra, improving your emotional connections, especially with that special someone. If you have children, spend real quality time with them. There is much you can teach and much you can learn, simply by engaging in play.


 Taurus
You may get more cooperation from your co-workers than you expected today as the Moon sweeps into your sign and Venus dances into Libra. If progress is your goal, you'll have all the support you need from superiors. The forward-looking Bull will be rewarded, while those who wish to retain the status quo may find they are standing on shaky ground.


 Gemini
Teamwork in your community can be fun and exciting today. Spending time with your neighbors or your siblings will be productive. It will be easier than usual to get along with everyone as positive energy is high. Venus dancing into stylish Libra brings a very positive emotional connection to your love life over the weeks ahead.


 Cancer
Your efforts are apparent and appreciated today; don't give up, even if you feel like you're not making much progress. You are likely to be recognized for your attention to duty and the fine job you do, so be patient. If you're feeling stressed out, take a brisk walk this evening. Release your energy creatively and positively.


 Leo
The Moon and Mars combine to give you great creative energy today; even if you are overburdened it will be easy to whistle while you work. Communicating with others at a distance will be enjoyable; consider joining a discussion board on the Internet for a subject you have always been interested in. Whether it is bird watching or coin collecting, you are sure to learn a great deal!


 Virgo
Emotional energy is high thanks to the Moon and Mars... you should be able to handle anything that comes your way today. Don't be afraid to deal with hard issues; you'll have the courage and understanding you need to face deeply personal and possibly controversial monetary issues. Just remember that struggle makes growth possible.


 Libra
You'll feel in tune with your best friend or mate as the Moon moves through your seventh house of marriage and partnerships. Communication and cooperation should be easier as loving Venus sweeps into your sign. Good things can come from being open and honest, so share your thoughts and feelings with someone you care about.


 Scorpio
By choice or circumstances you may tend to withdraw from society as Venus slips into your twelfth house of secrets and sorrows. Of course there are all types of excuses, legitimate or otherwise, to pass up invitations, but romance may have to be secretive or in the world of fantasy. Beware of false flattery or unworthy attentions. Love relationships from the past, especially those in which you suffered a loss, can intrude in some way.


 Sagittarius
The planets combine to create high energy today; you should have the courage and strength to tackle whatever comes your way. Friends will be a great help and communication will be very beneficial. Good news from afar is very promising, thanks to a brilliant aspect between Mercury and Jupiter.


 Capricorn
Overcome your fears by facing them squarely today; it may be time to 'let go and let God' in certain situations. You may find that by releasing your fears you are better able to accomplish your goals... the fear of being inferior may be holding you back, but as Venus enters your mid-heaven, you'll be everyone's darling at work, or in the public sphere. This is a very intuitive and perceptive day, so take note of the impressions you experience.


 Aquarius
You may feel like you're running here, there and everywhere as Mercury and Jupiter blend positively. Fortunately, you should have all the energy you need and then some, thanks to Venus in Libra. This is a wonderful day to touch base. Why not meet a favourite for lunch?


 Pisces
You can be a powerhouse at work as the Moon and Jupiter blend well today; if you have been frustrated or angry, channel the excess energy into achieving your goals. Even if you are unemployed you can use today's aspects to get ahead in life; it will be a lot easier to understand that living well really is the best revenge. Go get 'em!

The federal government's United States Park Police is working with San Francisco cops to solve the case of a shooting in Aquatic Park, the popular swim and beach spot near the Hyde Street Pier, according to the San Francisco Examiner.

Suspects identified only as young men shot an unknown victim at 8 p.m. Monday near the bocce ball courts at the end of Van Ness Avenue, according to the newspaper. The victim is in stable condition.
The Park Police are the lead agency because the shooting occurred on federal land, according to the newspaper.
The area was closed off during the initial investigation for some hours, forcing civilians who had parked their cars in the area to wait to depart the city on Labor Day.

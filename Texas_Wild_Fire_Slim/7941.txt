   GREEN POWER




 
    I have
used this and it is great! Very easy to use and great videos that are
very easy to follow. I made myself a wind mill and am generating power
for my work shop to power my lights! They have a great resources for
the parts that you need to build either a windmill (my project) or
solar panels. If it wasn't for my air compressor in my shop I would
have it totally off the "grid". So check it out and
help keep the earth green and have some fun making your own power.

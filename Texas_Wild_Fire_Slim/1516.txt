John Henderson wasn't pleased with the tattered American flag hanging from a flag pole at a Ohio Burger King, so he took it down himself.
"I took it in my own hands," The Vietnam veteran told Fox 8 Cleveland. "Whether it be right or wrong, I have a deep feeling for this country and all the people who died for it."
The Associated Press reports that Henderson said the ragged flag is a symbol of sacrifices soldiers have made and that he just couldn't let it go.
A Burger King employee who works at the Perkins Township restaurant reportedly threatened to press charges against Henderson. But a Burger King executive struck a more conciliatory tone, promising to replace the distressed flag and invite Henderson to a flag-raising ceremony.
Henderson told the Sandusky Register that the flag weighed about 100 pounds.
Burger King’s district supervisor told the Register that the store's flag cost $350 and that wind easily damages it.
"They cost too much money to be replaced every couple weeks," he told the news outlet.

																Many veterans groups are designed to lobby Congress, not to help individual soldiers. And with 530,000 soldiers wounded since 2001, the VA is hard-pressed to help them all. So where should soldiers returning home go?

				Burger King’s district supervisor told the Register that the store's flag cost $350 and that wind easily damages it.

"They cost too much money to be replaced every couple weeks," he told the news outlet.

How much was the cost to the people who fought for your right and freedom to be able to fly that flag?  Some paid the ultimate price.  How petty of you to put a price tag on your country.  Haven't we had enough of the fighting over what things cost?  I would suggest that maybe you do not deserve to fly that flag, if the cost is all that is of importance to you.

				This proves that community isn't worthy of flying a flag. I'm going to take the next couple of minutes to inspect the flag hanging on my wall, which I proudly hung over my bunk my whole deployment of Iraq - and remember my guys that didn't make it back.

I salute you, John Henderson.

				I would think that a person would deduce from Title 4 of the United States Code Section 8(k) - proscribin­g the means to retire a flag, gives a valid reason and then described in detail the manner in which it is to be disposed of. 

I notice IT DOES not proscribe a penalty for flying a tattered flag

after reading the law one must look to --- it's intent, flags hanging in particular places were being sold or made into shirts, shorts and being cut up and sold under the premise that the flag was worn/tatte­red not worthy of display the rules creation was to prevent desecratio­n-- which I firmly support and I am sure you do too.

				No, a criminal is someone who'd put a gun in your mouth and pull the trigger or beat you to death for the $4 in your pocket.  Mr. Anderson is someone who really saw the flag not being given proper reverence and took steps to address it.  

Yes, the way he went about it probably isn't the best way to do it, but if what he did makes him a "criminal"­, then sir, I'd hope we could have about 100 million more "criminal'­s" just like him out there.

				a thief takes something that does not belong to him= Larceny (larceny is a criminal act in every state)

As much as you want to admire the man for - protesting his actions are criminal
plain and simple--- there is no way around it  

I am not suggesting­/insinuati­ng the man goes to jail or anything but he himself admits right or wrong I did it-- 

Now we know larceny is a crime-- and NO one presents a LAW Burger King broke unless the patriot policemen here indict BK. 

I am very glad we live in a republic where the majority is limited by law.

				I think the important thing to know is this veteran probably knowingly caused trouble at this BK, didn't care, and took down the busted flag anyway.  He didn't complain about it.  He didn't talk trash about doing it.  He. DID. IT.  That takes more conviction than the average citizen, to break the law to make a point.  There's something admirable about that, I think.

				To be fair, it is against flag code. There are rules for displaying flags that go beyond Federal law and are tied to state legislatio­n. It's one thing to display a flag and not know this. 

However, if this was truly law abiding, he would have just called the cops and have the Burger King served with the charge. Or suggested it to the management ahead of time. Passion can get people carried away, but on the plus side, no blood was shed over this. I think that's uncommon enough to be lauded.

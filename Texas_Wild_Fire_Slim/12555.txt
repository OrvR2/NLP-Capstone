The hunt has included an analysis of flight logs and other documentsThe intelligence from the informant, who is considered reliable by the CIA, led to the national state of high alert over the possible terror strike on the anniversary of 9/11, but the informant’s information itself may be secondhand, ABC News has learned.Despite the secondhand nature of the source, the high quality of the information led authorities to deem the threat credible, if uncorroborated, and triggered the massive rapid police response in Washington and New York, and the all-hands intelligence community and law enforcement manhunt.Read More http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/911-anniversary-plot-terror-suspects-inside-us/story?id=14489143 Related articlesTerror Plot: No Suspects Yet in Alleged Al Qaeda 9/11 Plan ()No evidence of suspected 9/11 terror plot – San Francisco Chronicle ()Update on Terror Threat ()Video: More details on terror alert ()Developing: New 9/11 Terror Plot ()Report: At least three suspected jihadists entered the U.S. in August with intent to launch “vehicle-borne attack”; at least one is U.S. citizen () Tags: Abcnews, Al Qaeda, Central Intelligence Agency, Cia, New York, United States, Warfare and Conflict, Washington Posted

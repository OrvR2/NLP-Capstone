Newt Gingrich decided to fall back on his "attack the media" act during the NBC GOP debate on Wednesday. (Gingrich had a series of arguments with moderators during the last Fox News debate.)
Telling moderator John Harris that he would "repudiate" any and all media organizations that used the debate format "to get Republicans fighting with each other," Gingrich went on an extended harangue, similar to one at the Fox debate. Naturally, in both situations, the debate organizers were simply trying to help voters determine the differences between the candidates. (And in case Gingrich failed to notice, Perry and Romney very happily fought with each other right at the start of the debate, without being prompted.)
"You want to puff this up into some giant thing," Gingrich said, about the differences between Romney and Perry on health care. "Everyone up here is against Obamacare," he added, pointing out something that no one needed a televised debate to determine. He went on to insist that the entire slate of GOP candidates were part of "a team" dedicated to removing Obama from office.

				Is Newt suggesting some sort of politburo then? If he doesn't want actual debates by actual candidates and suggest they are a "Team" dedicated to a common cause, does he believe the American people shouldn't see the difference­s in their candidates­? Who does he want to choose the candidate to run against Obama?

				Very interestin­g how the Republican­s act.  Do you think the Democrats acted this way 8 years ago?  They did not collude to take down bush. They presented themselves and their ideas to lead the country.  No such thing from these clowns.  But, you have to hand it to them. They are winning the battle in the media.  The Democrats could learn from these guys (and gal) how to stand together for their principles­.  Interestin­g.

				I have noticed over the past several years that the news media is sensationa­lizing the news more and more and in my opinion is their attempt to gain audience attention. I also believe that each of these originatio­ns think that if they don’t have a significan­t story over and above another network, their ratings will suffer. Thus, they use the method of “sensation­alizing” to achieved this end result. And then these same people wonder why they have an approval rating not that far off from congress….­..

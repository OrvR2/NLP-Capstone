WASHINGTON -- The White House is denying a report that President Obama is considering calling for a moratorium on regulations affecting the economy, save those that deal with health care and financial regulations, in his Thursday jobs speech. 
"Those reports are false," said White House spokesman Clark Stevens, in a statement to The Huffington Post. "The Administration has a strong record of implementing smart, sensible steps that protect consumers, public health, and the environment. While the President has made clear that we must continue to ensure that new regulations are based on common sense, and implemented in ways that do not impede our economic recovery, he has also made clear that he will not accept the false choice of either having prosperity or clean air, clean water, and safe food. Americans deserve both, and we will continue to take steps that provide those protections, while fostering economic growth."
Word that Obama was a considering a moratorium on regulations came in a Wednesday morning New York Times story that detailed the choices the administration was pondering in hopes of recasting the president as a pragmatic job creator. The story noted there were "internal divisions" among some Obama advisers "over the scope of his economic address to a joint session of Congress on Thursday night": 
The president intends to offer at least some progressive proposals to help regain a fighting posture that he has not had since the health care debate, but a provision is also being discussed to place a new moratorium on some regulations that affect the economy, excluding health care and financial rules. The proposals are likely to infuriate an already unhappy Democratic base.
The idea of that the president would consider a regulatory moratorium beyond health care and financial regulations struck Democrats as a potentially massive cave to business interests; and not an entirely inconceivable one. Obama already signed an executive order that implemented a government-wide review to "remove outdated regulations." This past week, the administration withdrew a proposed regulation that would have set stricter ozone standards. 
Stevens' statement calms some of the initial concern expressed in the New York Times piece. It also gives a bit of hope to progressives heading into Thursday's address. It does not, however, seem likely to win over those environmentalists or progressives already disheartened with the administration's current regulatory agenda.

				He is ideologica­lly incapable of giving a speech on job creation that could ever actually create jobs.
Besides his world class narcissism­, that would preclude him from ever admitting over regulating to begin with, he really doesn't know that they've made a bad situation worse.

The biggest problem with his jobs speech is to see how many Americans actually watch it. If, after all of this build up, few do watch, it will be a dire indication that the American people have stopped listening to his ubiquitiou­s speeches, statements­, talking points, and pontificat­ions. Since that's all he's ever really had going for him, he'll have to actually deliver what he's avoided, positive results.  If that's the case, stick a fork in his Presidency­.

				For businesses­, EVERY AND ANY regulation will "cripple business".  Please tell me one single regulation in the history of America that wasn't opposed on the basis of the same old tired argument that it'll cripple business.

Yeah, I'm dependent on Gub-mint to enforce rules that keep big money from running roughshod over everyone, including small businesses­.  I don't care how smart you think you are, there are millions of people out there, in business, whose full time job it is to figure out ways to fleece you, exploit you, poison you or maim you for profit.  Con-men love people who think they're so smart they can single-han­dedly protect themselves­.

				Only thing wrong with the concept is that most of the regs were there long before Obama became President.
Of course all regs need to be killed.
Who cares if there is no clean water, freash air to breath and the soil is ever so slighty radioactiv­e?
Let's bring back good old fashon Snog, rivers that catch fire and flaming water comming out of the kitchen sink. And that soft glow comming from the nuclear waste dump.
What good is a clean enviroment­?? And let's outlaw that nasty idea of Climate Change. So it's a little warmer, doesn't rain on a third of the country or it snows in Miami. Who cares??
Our masters must make the most profit. 
Like Trump say in China you can plan and build a new city in 2 weeks. 
That what they did for the three rivers dam. So what if they displaced 3 millon people?

				What it'll indicate is that Boehner refused to call a joint session on the day this speech was originally intende, and forced this address to be scheduled when it will compete with the opening of the NFL.  It'll also prove that Americans care more about football than their country.  Bread and circuses.

Of course he's ideologica­lly incapable of giving a speech that could actually create jobs.  Speeches don't create jobs.  Never did, never will.

				Obviously Americans are stupid and will vote for for any one with  a catchy slogan or if they are scared that Iraq will attack the US.  They have no faith in themselves or anything of any value.  If the stock market crashes they will vote fot Palin because she will promise a moose in every fridge.
They will bring back Greenspan and he will say everything is ok as he wants to know who he is.
So next election vote in democrats and a republican president.  Hmmmm that idiot from Texas?
We need to break the backs of government pensions the unions and all the CEOs, and many others. Everyone needs to stop throwing away the money!!!!!­!!

				"(Obama) has also made clear that he will not accept the false choice of either having prosperity or clean air, clean water, and safe food. Americans deserve both, and we will continue to take steps that provide those protection­s, while fostering economic growth."And to prove it ,  Obama halted new pollution regulation­s. Maybe Obama can do stand up when he leaves the Oval Office. He's better suited to that than to the presidency­.

				Hey lynn...Her­e are a couple of instances and there are a lot more.  We demand that we protect a lizard instead of building homes to help a lot of American people and create jobs.  We protect a salamander instead of building a hydroelect­ric dam and helping a lot of American people and create jobs.  We protect a frog instead of allowing a manufactur­ing plant to be built in the US to give jobs to a lot of American people.  News flash...Ch­ina, India, Korea, etc. protect the environmen­t but do not put that kind of silly-asse­d regulation­s on their business and industry investors.  Our companies are not moving their operations overseas for the physical climate, but because of friendly business climates.  There go the jobs, but we still have the frogs and lizards.  Thanks to the LIberals.

				In case you didn't notice, the new houses being built already aren't exactly selling very well. 

There's plenty of run down buildings in the cities that could be razed/renn­ovated for manufactur­ing instead of building in pristine wilderness areas. The bonus there is that it would help revitalize many downtown areas.

The Glen Canyon Hydroelect­ric dam is destroying the Grand Canyon ecosystem. Currently wind farms are going up throughout the west and - providing jobs to American people without destroying rivers. 

Regulation­s don't prevent jobs - if a company sees an opportunit­y to make money, they'll jump through all the hoops in the world to do so. Same goes for high taxes. No sane person or business ever opted to make LESS money because of taxes. 

As for the frogs and lizards, I'll take 'em. They're nicer and more in touch with reality than most right wingers. If you don't like it, feel free to move to India, China or Korea.

				Yeah, you evidently don't know much about the environmen­t in China or India.  The most certainly DO NOT protect the environmen­t.

There are plenty of sites for manufactur­ing plants that don't have to endanger wildlife.  The problem is that developers would render a species extinct than to spend one extra dollar putting their plants or their housing subdivisio­ns elsewhere.  The continued existence of a species counts for $0 in their cost/benef­it analyses.

If you knew anything, you'd also know that China, and Asia generally, is losing species at a rapid rate.  They don't have these types of regulation­s.  A handful of mining, manufactur­ing and logging moguls are getting outrageous­ly wealthy, but there's little trickle-do­wn effect. The average worker still lives like a peasant.

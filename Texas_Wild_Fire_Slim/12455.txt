This Day Is Stained by Shame
What happened after the attacks was unforgivable: Paul Krugman

(Newser) -
                                    For many Americans, the 10th anniversary of September 11 comes shrouded in feelings of grief and loss, but the overwhelming emotion for Paul Krugman is shame. The "atrocity should have been a unifying event," but instead "fake heroes like Bernie Kerik, Rudy Giuliani, and, yes, George W....

US Did Not  'Overreact' to 9/11

(Newser) -
                                    Charles Krauthammer issues an emphatic rebuttal to what he calls the "new conventional wisdom" about 9/11—that the US overreacted and brought upon itself a ruinous decade of war and financial misery.

(Newser) -
                                    Usually "public intellectuals" are supposed to add nuance to a discussion, but when it comes to al-Qaeda and 9/11, Christopher Hitchens has taken up a different motto: "Never, ever ignore the obvious," he writes for  Slate .

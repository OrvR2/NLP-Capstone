Texas Wildfire Video Unbelievable Footage
September 7, 2011By MaggieTake a look at how quickly this Texas wildfire spreads in less than one minute. Unbelievable. May God comfort those who have lost loved ones, and those who have lost all they own. . See a continually updated interactive map of the fire locations here. See a dramatic photo essay here.
Texas Wildfires
The Lonely Conservative says Federal firefighting planes are sitting idle because of a glitch (or perhaps on purpose) in contracting.

Federal Firefighting Planes Sit Idle as Fire Ravages Texas | The Lonely Conservative on September 7, 2011 at 7:03 pm        

[...] are more details about the contract. It really makes no sense, especially when seeing videos like this one, showing how quickly these wildfires spread.It makes you wonder, did the company owners contribute [...]

There are ten tankers on site at the Bastrop fire.  They are also using choppers to drop water.  I live in a wildfire area and have been through the wringer this summer, nearly losing my home and my parents nearly lost theirs.  We live with these things.  The idiocy about turning away volunteers is just that – idiocy.  They are using fire-fighters from all over the stage, just not volunteers from the Texas Nationalist Movement, who show up on the spot.  Would you want people patrolling your neighborhood that no one knows?  I would not. Sorry, but when an area is evacuated, you rely on the professionals to do their job – and they are very good at it.
They probably don’t need over 10 tankers.  We had a 110,000 acre monster here and they had maybe 4 tankers.  Ten is a heck of a lot. Their drops are pin-point, just like a modern bombing run.  They don’t just go in and blanket the area in slurry.  They pick and choose.  It is amazing to watch them.  Also – from what I gather on Sunday and Monday it would not have made a difference.  The winds would not allow air support.

Hi Pink Flamingo, thanks so much for this inside information. If the federal planes are not needed, that’s good to know. My friend from high school lives in Georgetown, and her niece lives in Bastrop. They have evacuated and don’t know whether they have a house or not. I heard this morning that Texas has lost 1,000 homes to these fires. May God bless your home and keep it safe.

I remember when Yellowstone was ablaze.. I’d drive there about every weekend to see how much was gone. It was a full summer and half of fall before the rains and snow put it out. It was just one big ash… but now, 20 some ought years later, it’s just beautiful and new. Those trees needed that fire to renew the forest. Those trees were over 300 years old and to get new trees, the pine cones needed fire to open them, so that new and healthier growth could start. Don’t get me wrong. It was devastating to see that park burn. It was very tough on the wildlife. But to see the trees and underbrush come back was an amazing thing. It was 3 to 4 years before the new trees started to rise. The old burned out hulks stood for 10 to 15 years before most of them fell and started to supply new top soil and homes for smaller animals. Now the new trees are over 15 feet tall, and it’s an amazing sight. It’s just natures way of doing things. Those fires were started by lightning though, and there were no homes, except those outside the park that were in danger. This fire is so different and much more troubling. My prayers are with the people in Texas, affected by this devastation.

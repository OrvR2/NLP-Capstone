lyrics
Prayin' For Rain

The Sun's Been Shining / Down On Me
But those Bright Skies / I don't want to see
The Ground is Hard / The Soil is Dry
Crops are turning brown / They're Gonna Die


       I'm Prayin' for rain / I'm wishin' for storms
       I'm hopin' the sun / Don't burn up my corn
       Do you hear me Lord / Listen to my plea
       A Good Days rain / Is all I need / Is all I Need


I Make My Living / Living off the land
Ground was first plowed / By Grandpa's hand
My Daddy Died here / Gave blood to dirt
I'll give mine too / For all it's worth


A  banker came by / said he meant no harm
If I lose this crop / I'll lose my farm
The rows are dry / soil is dust
If the harvest dies / I go bust

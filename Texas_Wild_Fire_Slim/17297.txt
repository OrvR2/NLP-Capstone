248.11 Do Something To Help The Fire Victims
Things To Do In Austin | 7 Sep 2011

For anyone looking for something to do today, the best use of your time would be helping the many victims of wildfires in our area.

If you’re looking for something easy, you can eat at Sugar Mamas today. All of their profits from today’s sales will be split between Austin Pets Alive and Red Cross. They are located 1905 South First St.
Another fun thing you can do is go play video games at Kung Fu Saloon. All the quarters put into their video games will be donated to victims of the fires. They are located at 510 Rio Grande St.
Yesterday I compiled a list of places where you can drop off donations. To see the list visit: http://365thingsaustin.com/2011/09/06/how-you-can-help-fire-victims-donation-locations-what-to-donate/.
If you have anything you would like me to add just let me know.

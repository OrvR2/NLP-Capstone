FBI investigating jihadist threat to kill David LettermanBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – Thu, Aug 18, 2011

(CBS)
The FBI is investigating a threat on a jihadist message board that urges radical Muslims to kill David Letterman.
A recent post on the Shumukh al-Islam forum--which has been referred to as a "clearing house for al-Qaeda material"--suggested someone cut off the "Late Show" host's tongue and "shut it forever." The commenter, "Umar al-Basrawi," also referred to Letterman as a "lowly Jew"; Letterman, whose mother is a Presbyterian church secretary, is not Jewish.
The threat was apparently in response to a joke Letterman made in his June 8 monologue about Ilyas Kashmiri, an Al-Qaeda leader killed in a U.S.-led drone strike in Pakistan in June.
"So (al Qaeda) picked a successor to Osama bin Laden and his name was Ilyas Kashmiri," Letterman said. "Well, guess what, he was blown up by an American drone. It wasn't going to work anyways because they got off to a rocky start with this guy. He botched up the story of Paul Revere."

Al-Baswari claimed that Letterman "put his hand on his neck and demonstrated the way of slaughter."
"Is there not amongst you a Sayyid Nosair al-Masri?" Al-Basrawi continued, a reference to the man convicted of killing Meir Kahane, the founder of the Jewish Defense League, in 1990.
Letterman "showed his evil nature and deep hatred for Islam and Muslims," Al-Basrawi added. "We ask Allah to paralyze his tongue and grant the sincere monotheists his neck."
SITE, a service that monitors threatening online material, discovered the post. Representatives for both CBS and Letterman declined comment.
The threat against Letterman follows a similar one made last year against "South Park" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone over the Comedy Central show's depiction of the prophet Muhammad in a bear suit.
And Letterman himself is no stranger to criminal threats. A CBS News producer was convicted of attempted extortion of Letterman in 2009, threatening to expose an affair the late night funnyman had with a staff member.
In 2005, a man who worked on Letterman's Montana ranch was jailed after plotting to kidnap his son.

Letterman and every other late night comedian has made jokes about politicans, religions, world leaders etc. forever, some funny, some not so much, bet leave it to a Muslim to threaten someone. What the hell is wrong with those people, do they ever smile, laugh? what a sad, morbid life. No wonder death is no big deal, whats to live for?

Isn't Dave part of the liberal crowd that swears Muslims are our friends and we should embrace them? Be nice Dave, they just want to chop your head off, no big deal. Now go play nice with the Muslims.

What do jihadists and teahadists have in common? 

They both want to kill David Letterman and they both hate America.

"Sanction is given to those who fight because they were wronged - surely God is able to protect them - who were driven forth from their homes without justification, only because they say "Our Lord is God"' (Qur'an 22.39-40). 

"Not equal are the good deed and the evil deed. Repel evil with what is better and behold, he between whom and thee was enmity, shall be as if he were a warm friend" (Qur'an 41.34). 

Who started the issues between Muslims and others (Jews and Christians and Pagans). When did it start? Conduct some research into the WHO and WHEN.

I do not like some of his jokes and sometimes I find it offensive.  I call him an IDIOT but do not start making death threats.      

Hopefully liberals and democrats will see what this so call peaceful religion is for what it is.  But I highly doubt it! 

All you have to do is go to Dearborn, Michigan and see for yourself. It's like the Middle East when they have loud speakers calling for prayer.

Dear Muslim jihadist people, 

Here in the civilized United States when we don't like what someone says on television instead of killing or cutting off the body parts of that person we simply turn the channel. 
For complete instructions please referre to your users manual.

Thank you

Please, take Letterman away. He is NOT funny, NOT entertaining, I for one would rejoice if he disappeared from the airways for ever.

I wanna take timeout and thank all Middle Eastern women for constantly taking one for the team. Think of all terrorist activities that would be taking place if these guys weren't too busy oppressing their five to ten wives!!! I am not hating, atleast you're not like Christine O'donnell who hasn't figured out that monogamy cannot exist without masturbation.

Al-Baswari needs to get his eyes checked.  Or maybe I do because I didn't see the gesture he is complaining about.  Al-Baswari should show up at the closest CIA to file a complaint if it is true :)

So if the jihadist loving terrorist muslim wins he kills a leftwing antiAmerican communist SHlTBAG and sexual predator ?

If the leftwing communist SHlTBAG wins that will be one more dead muslim terrorist or be a captured terrorist who we can get information out of?

Where is the downside to this?

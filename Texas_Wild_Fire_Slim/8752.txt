Pier 1 shares pop on 2Q revenueAP – Thu, Sep 1, 2011





NEW YORK (AP) — Shares of Pier 1 Imports Inc. popped nearly 9 percent Thursday afternoon after the company said a key revenue measure increased and the retailer predicted better-than-expected second-quarter earnings.The home décor chain, based in Fort Worth, Texas, said revenue at stores open at least a year climbed 10.8 percent in the June through August period. The company said that more customers visited the store, and spent more when they did. Better merchandise and in-store presentation helped, analysts said.Revenue at stores open at least a year is a key measure of a company's health, because it excludes the effects of recently opened or closed stores.Pier 1 also said it expects second-quarter earnings of 14 cents per share — higher than the 13 cents analysts had predicted. It also expects merchandise profit margins to improve as it better manages inventory.CEO Alex Smith said customers are "reacting favorably" to the Halloween and autumn merchandise in the stores, which could be a good sign for future sales.Increased TV and radio advertising and new store fixtures and remodeling probably helped sales, Sterne Agee analysts Jennifer Milan and Jessica Gerberi said. They list Pier 1 as a "Buy" and think it will continue to take business from competitors if it keeps improving its merchandise and stores. They also said they expect online sales to pick up as the company rolls out "Pier 1 To-Go," which lets customers reserve goods online and pick them up at the stores.Shares rose 81 cents, or 7.6 percent, to $11.49 at midday.Pier 1 is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings Sept. 15.

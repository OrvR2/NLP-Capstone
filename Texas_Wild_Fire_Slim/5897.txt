SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego police say surveillance tape shows a person dressed like Gumby telling a convenience store clerk he is being robbed, fumbling inside the costume as if to pull a gun, dropping 27 cents and leaving.
Police say the attempted robbery took place Monday at a 7-Eleven in Rancho Penasquitos, Calif.
Detective Gary Hassen tells San Diego's 10News the clerk never heard of Gumby. He described the character as a green SpongeBob SquarePants.
After being told it was a robbery, the clerk told the man in costume not to waste his time.
The clerk didn't report the encounter, but his boss called police after seeing the tape.
Hassen says police are taking it seriously and looking for the suspect. A $1,000 reward is being offered.

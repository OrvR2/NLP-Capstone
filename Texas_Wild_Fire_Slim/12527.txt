Central Texas is not the only area in the state fighting wildfires. The Texas Forest Service says 60 homes have been destroyed and another 150 are threatened by a wildfire raging about 40 miles northwest of Houston.
Spokeswoman Melissa Yunas said the fire covers 7,000 acres in Waller, Montgomery and Grimes counties.
Waller County Judge Glenn Beckendorff said the homes are part of an unincorporated area that straddles his county and Montgomery County to the east.
The 61-year-old Beckendorff said the fire is ‘the worst I can remember in my lifetime.’
He said the wind was down Tuesday, but it was still causing problems because it changed directions.
Grimes County Judge Betty Shiflett said she knows of only two homes that have burned. But she expressed concern that the fire could worsen.
Shiflett said the county was in ‘an emergency mode.’

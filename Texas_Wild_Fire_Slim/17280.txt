Winehouse had only Librium in system at death: fatherBy Alex Dobuzinskis: Editing by Bob Tourtellotte | Reuters – Fri, 9 Sep, 2011

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The father of singer Amy Winehouse said that his daughter had the prescription medication Librium in her system when she died of a seizure in July, according to media reports on Friday.
At a taping of a segment for journalist Anderson Cooper's new talk show "Anderson," which debuts on Monday, Mitch Winehouse repeated past statements that his daughter had no illegal drugs in her system.
"What happened to Amy wasn't anything to do with drugs," he said. A video portion of the interview is posted on celebrity website TMZ.com.
The 27-year-old soul singer scored hits with such songs as "Rehab" and "Back to Black," which was the title track of her smash hit 2006 album. But even as Winehouse rose to stardom, she battled drug and alcohol addiction.
When she died on July 23, it was widely assumed that substance abuse was the root cause. Toxicology results from an autopsy released by the family late last month showed no illegal substances and some alcohol, although how it contributed to her death was not made clear.
Mitch Winehouse told Cooper that the only drug in her system was a small amount of Librium, which is used to help people overcome alcohol detoxification.
The appearance on Cooper's talk show "Anderson" is the Winehouse family's first major TV interview since the British singer's death at her home in London.

Loser or drunk or whatever-the thing people should remember about Amy is that despite her character defects and addictions-she was a talented gifted artist who's voice was so fine and unique....give her a break man-she gave us some great music while she was alive so I think she deserves that....ya wanna judge? look in the mirror all you saints.

Amy's father is grieving and in denial. He is grasping for some answers to ease his suffering,but it's not doing anyone any good for him to speculate. He is trying to survive the loss of his daughter and to put it into some kind of perspective.

It's a bit strange that she would have a seizure while she had 2 anti-seizure substances running through her veins. Librium + Alcohol. If anything, I would think that it suppressed her CNS (Central Nervous System) so much that her heart just stopped. This is usually the case for many of these accidental drug and alcohol cases. Why Librium ? Valium is the #1 Benzo for alcohol withdrawal.. Librium is way down the list for most doctors. I'm no coroner so if it's a seizure, so be it. She must have been tapering off of both at the same time and it was to much of a shock to her CNS. Many alcohols don't realize the seriousness of quitting drinking, if any of you find yourself starting to drink a lot more, think about the withdrawal consequences. Benzodiazepine and alcohol withdrawal are considered the only 2 deadly ones, if you start hallucinating or shaking/convulsing, head to the hospital or to the liquor store real quick. Heroine is considered 2nd to the severity of alcohol. CBS cares. NBC , the more you know. I currently take Librium for anxiety, my pharmacist had to do a double take, he said I was the only one he's known to take it, I was on clonazepam before. Don't get started on any of these things, once you're in too deep, it's very hard to get off of without a detox facility, or unless you want go cold turkey on your own and get a little taste of hell! The Shakes are the worst ... aka ... Delirium tremens. While I'm here, don't take sleeping pills such as Ambien, they are cousin drugs of Benzo's and are called Z-drugs.  They are argued to be more addictive then Benzo's and in my own experience, that is true. I would much rather be taking a zopiclone pill right now instead of a Librium. Stay away.

Librium is a sedative/hypnotic drug that should not be taken by people who use alcohol. More proof it is an illuminati murder.

That sucks. Makes me wonder why people just jump to conclusions that she had an overdose. By the sounds of it she was trying to quit. Librium is given to stop alcohol withdrawl. She had a grand mal seizure which can be fatal if not receiving immediate care. So to all that still say it was a drug overdose just stop cause its proven not true.

Funny how people find a reason to put others down and how some have the need to defend. Her Dad is making the point that there were no drugs in her system and as most would know it takes time for drugs to get out of anyone's system. Maybe she was trying to get sober in that way since there were none. No one on this earth is perfect. Everyone has a right to their opinion and most obviously don't care if even her parents dare to read comments on a story of their daughter. I hope the hell not. You'd think they'd know better. Society lives on ill will. We feed it. Its easier to be negative than accentuate the positive. Its just the way it goes. I say, don't feed the hate, say nothing. Its not worth a fight in words between people who don't know each other.

It's not a matter of people's lack of compassion as much as artists like Elvis Prestley, Michael Jackson and Kurt Cobain wanting to go out on a high note...so to speak. Specifically they didn't want to peak as performers in adult diapers like Mary Pickford or Liz Taylor. They chose their final curtain call and that speaks volumes as to the class of entertainers they were and will be remember as such.

The brightest stars burn twice as brightly as the rest, but only for half as long. Her life was a series of ups and downs, but I think it's best to remember her not for her excesses but for her amazing talent. She could sing circles around most, and she gave us what little time she had--to the fullest. Thank you, Amy.

to be capable of reaching depths of despondency, pain ... even joy - then expressing them - requires a soul bared and brute open and a heart and eyes in no way shaded for protection like half you jack asses stuble through life. trying being a brilliant artist. try expressing intensity. try sharing life.

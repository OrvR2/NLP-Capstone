Rocket fired from Gaza hits IsraelAFP – 18 hrs ago

A rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed in the southern Israeli Shaar Hanegev region on Wednesday, causing no damage or casualties, the Israeli military told AFP.
Overnight on Tuesday, Israeli warplanes carried out an air strike in Gaza, killing a militant and wounding a father and his two sons, Palestinian medical sources and a militant group in the territory said.
The strike, east of the central city of Khan Yunis, killed Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) member Khaled Sahmud, 24, and came after militants fired a mortar round to push back an "Israeli incursion," the group said in a statement.
On Monday night, warplanes bombed a suspected weapons manufacturing site in the central Gaza Strip after a rocket was fired from the Palestinian territory.
The new mortar and rocket fire came despite a ceasefire that came into force after a spasm of violence that followed a militant attack in Eilat on August 18, which left eight Israelis dead.
Israel responded with a series of air strikes on Gaza, killing 27 Palestinians, and militant groups in the coastal enclave fired dozens of rockets into the Jewish state.
Israel accused the PRC of being behind the Eilat attack, but the group denied it was responsible.

Judge,
Once more I'd like to point out that posting quotes from other people only demonstrates that you lack the ability to come up with a thought of your own.

I wish that Israel would declare war on somebody. Maybe then all of the jews in America would go help their bretheren and we could get our banks back in order and stop all of the crooked dealings that caused this mess we are in. Hopefully all of the jewish lobbyists that pay off our corrupt politicians would leave too. Then we would actually have a government of the people for the people instead of a government for the rich jew business man. I know that n one wants to hear this but get over it.

It completely blows me how you trashy eastern European peasants think you have an entitlement to the land of Palestine.

I respect the Palestinians, they fight for thier beliefs with whatever they have, unlike the pathetic and cowardly @ssraeli's who get the US to take down thier hard targets(Iraq-maybe Iran) while the "mighty" IDF get thier butts kicked by stone throwing children and peace activists and cry and whine to the whole world.

Crow, you are perfectly right. Jews are a small nation, inhabiting a tiny country, not a must for this nation as far as national interest is concerned but they are our best and true allies in an insane part of the world. We cannot trust any mohammedans , ever. ( pakistan !!!)
As far as dancing, nope. Just clean as/s kicking.

Besides the Iron Dome system, Israel needs to develop a "Return to Sender" system, whereby a rocket fired towards Israel reverses course and heads back to its point of launch. Imagine the look on Achmend's face (and the load in his pants) when he sees his missle coming directly at him. This would be a new, indirect form of suicide bomber.

FOP you ever notice that INTELLIGENT non-jews generally don't have any problems with jews. They respect them in just about every field. On the other hand, low IQ losers are some of the most fervent anti-semites. You can tell just by reading the online posts. Is it because they are jealous? inferiority complex? just general anger at the world?

Isnt it funny/strange that "Palestinian authorities" always claim that somehow a father and his children were injured in a fatal strike on a terrorist?

What is that father doing there with his children?

hmmm...seems like Greg is finally waking up to the truth - " Israel is illegal. Israel is a murderous state. Israel is an apartheid state. Israel steals body organs from orphans. Israel is behind 9/11. Israel steal land. Israel steals water. Israel dehumanizes palestinians. Israel has no right to their historical religious sites. Israel sells drugs to kids dressed as nuns."

Dunkin Donuts plans to add stores in Waco
By Mike Copeland
Dunkin Donuts has announced it wants to add stores in Waco and nine other markets.
The company expects the restaurants in these communities to begin opening in early 2013.
"Dunkin Donuts' plans for these markets is part of an accelerated yet disciplined growth strategy," said John Dawson, chief development officer for Dunkin Brands. "We have generated considerable momentum in markets outside our core Northeast markets and are excited to offer additional opportunities for both our existing and new franchise candidates."
Dawson said the company is looking for qualified candidates with experience operating food-related operations. It offers franchisees flexible design concepts that include free-standing stores, end caps, in-line sites, kiosks and convenience stores.
For a limited time, the company is offering reduced royalty fees in these target markets, as well as an extra $10,000 for local store marketing.
For information about starting a franchise, visit www.dunkinfranchising.com.
The Massachusetts-based company has more than 9,700 restaurants in 31 countries.

Shipleys has poor customer service, the management
On Valley Mills act like they are doing us a favor over charging us for sub par kolaches and donuts.

Please come Dunkin.

They will have to be price competitive to make it here. I tried their brand of coffee that is sold in the grocery store. To me, it was not worth the high price they charge. I am not sure what Krispy Creme was thinking when they expanded. Every store they opened about the same time as the Waco location also closed about the same time. No one even sells them on street corners any more. Sometimes wanting something you can't have is better than actually having it.

In My Opinion ...




Should Baylor sue if A&M leaves the Big 12?

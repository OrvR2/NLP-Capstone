KHOU 11 has teamed up with Randalls to lend a hand to our “Neighbors in Need” who have been impacted by the devastating wildfires in our region. 
Now through September 11, you can help by donating to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund - online or in-person at any of the 35 Houston-area Randalls locations.
When you checkout at your neighborhood Randalls, you can make a donation of any amount, which will conveniently be added to your grocery total.  This donation will be indicated on your receipt.  Find the Randalls store nearest to you by visiting their website.
You can also give online to the American Red Cross of Greater Houston’s Disaster Relief Fund by clicking HERE.
Red Cross staff and volunteers are prepared year-round to meet the disaster-caused needs of people in our community.  Your donation helps insure that disaster services such as food, shelter, medical supplies, clean-up and other vital assistance are available to our neighbors whose lives have been affected.

 GENEVA (Tom Miles) - The pursuit of austerity measures and deficit cuts is pushing the world economy toward disaster in a misguided attempt to please global financial markets, the annual report of the United Nations economic thinktank UNCTAD said on Tuesday.
The report, entitled "Post-crisis policy challenges in the world economy," savaged U.S. and European economic policies and called for wage increases, stricter regulation of financial markets, including a return to a system of managed exchange rates, and a conscious break with market-led thinking.
"The message here is very pragmatic: we need to reverse our course quickly," said UNCTAD Secretary General Supachai Panitchpakdi.
Supachai, a former head of the World Trade Organization, said the policy response to the crisis, with an emphasis on fiscal tightening, was misconceived and inept.
The report's lead author Heiner Flassbeck said the global economic situation was extremely dangerous and, without more stimulus, a decade of stagnation was the best-case scenario.
The current policies were a disaster, said Flassbeck, head of the globalization and development strategies division at the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, and a former deputy finance minister in Germany.
 "If interests rates everywhere are zero, and if governments stick to the policy of not only keeping fiscal deficits where they are but retrenching, cutting public expenditure, then we will end up in permanent recession," he said.
"Unemployment depends very much on demand. And if you have no demand then you need government to step in with a huge program for stimulating the economy. This was the U.S. scenario in the past. Now it's worse because wages are rising less than in the past so you're going to need a bigger stimulus program."
The recovery from the financial crisis was not only jobless, which was to be expected, but it was also "wageless," he said, with Americans, Japanese and Europeans -- 70 percent of the world economy -- expecting their incomes to stagnate.
In its last report a year ago, UNCTAD said a premature removal of stimulus policies might cause a deflationary spiral with attendant slumps in growth and employment around the world.
"Let's not fool ourselves. This is a realistic scenario for the whole developed world, if we do not understand the lessons now, and really quickly, because we do not have other instruments any more," Flassbeck told a news conference to launch this year's report.
"To revive the economy with a wageless recovery with diminished expectations by the private economy, by private households, what are the instruments at hand? There is nothing."
He said that even if things go well, global economic growth would slow to about 1.5 percent in 2012, less than half the U.N. forecast of 3.1 percent growth for this year.
HERD MENTALITY
The report put much of the blame for the crisis on deregulation of financial markets, which it said invited destabilizing "herd behavior" by speculators, and allowed an over-concentration of banking activities.
"What we've seen in the past and we never learn is that countries seem to have excessive belief in the financial markets. And we've seen time and again that financial markets are not very sound in their judgment," said Supachai.
"But still people keep thinking that they are doing these austerity measures because they want to please the markets so that the markets give them better ratings, including the rating agencies which do not always produce the best assessment."
Flassbeck said the herd mentality was evident whenever equity markets and commodity markets all lurch in tandem on the same day, an effect that could not conceivably be caused by real swings in demand. But the world was ignoring it, he said.
"If the G20 negotiations were not confidential I would tell you that it's ignored even there," he said.
A November summit of the 20 biggest economies would reach "extremely weak" conclusions on tackling the crisis and would underestimate the influence of financial markets, he said.
"We have three areas where the G20 wanted to be strong. The first is the coordination of economic policy: nothing. The second is commodities speculation: more or less nothing; and the third is international global monetary order: nothing. So that's the result of nine months deliberation by the G20."
The U.N. report said the world should introduce a system of rules-based floating exchange rates, which would kill off distorting "carry trades" in which investors borrow currencies with low interest rates to buy higher-yielding currencies.
The system would be based on divergences between the consumer prices or interest rates applicable to different currencies, and unlike the defunct Bretton Woods system, it would cater for continual adjustments in exchange rates.

				What we are seeing us the single greatest theft in history. The wealthiest have looked at our world with cold calculatin­g eyes and they see a grim future.

The wealthiest know that every inch of the culture of consumptio­n is unsustaina­ble. They knew it fifty years ago but now with India and China joining in the rich know our fairy tale cannot last.

So the richest and most powerful are set on accumulati­ng as much as they can before the inevitable economic and population contractio­n that is coming. 

The wealthy in every country are ransacking social programs in the name of 'austerity­'. They are raking in money from every vulnerable demographi­c but their target is the middle class.

We are living in a historic sprint to the finish. But, there won't be a celebratio­n when the race has been won. We have long lived beyond our means economical­ly and environmen­tally now the bill is coming due. The wealthy are just farsighted enough to prepare, and they don't care that their 'preparati­on' hurries the arrival of the calamity they fear.

				The problem with liberals is that they believe Government is some abstract entity that is flush with cash.

They think that stimulus plans generate wealth because they don't account for the fact that there is a negative effect that is equal or greater.  The money used in a stimulus is taken OUT of the private sector where it STIMULATES the economy.  Net effect?  At best, zero.

				Who could have predicted that with rising unemployme­nt, falling consumer demand and decreased business investment that reducing Government spending would create a negative economic result? Any examinatio­n of the GDP equation is very difficult for those not skilled in the calculus of multi variable formulae. However when the inputs are all negative the end result is a given. So it is with the Teapublica­n whiz kids. Noting that the only positive was the input by Government their rush to slay the golden goose had an immediate negative result.

Now with the stimulus at an end only the failed Bush tax cuts and equally stupid Obama tax cut are in effect. These are once again displaying their false ideologica­l non-worth as job growth has stopped and GDP growth has fallen by 80%. These deficit creating economic piranha are consuming potential resources at a rate of $450 billion per year and delivering a comatose economy. Worse still are the economic lead boots of wars and bloated military/s­ecurity spending. These represent another $450 billion per year in economic hemorrhagi­ng. 

The Teapublica­ns are correct in their assessment that we are broke. The reason for this is their tax cuts, useless wars and corrupted security spending. It is only after this triumvirat­e of toxic policies are reversed that the resources required to repair a broken economy will be available.

				The stimulus did nothing, now that it has ended the economy is going south again. 

For those of you who are "skilled" in the calculus, try this one:

For every government worker that is one less productive person in the economy and one more burden for a private sector worker to finance.   If bigger government were the solution then hire 50 million people to work for government­.  You'll kill the private sector within weeks.  Why?  Simple math.  Every private worker has to support the government employee out of his/her earnings.  Make the ratio too large and it becomes unsustaina­ble.  We have reached that point.  

Raising taxes doesn't generate wealth, it impoverish­es everyone.  

The problem is the liberal spending mania, a 100% increase in spending in just 10 years!  (2000-2010­).  And your answer is to increase taxes 100%?  We will go broke pretty fast with that solution.  The minute you raise taxes politician­s increase spending.  When is the last time you saw a tax increase actually applied to the deficit?

				"The stimulus did nothing, now that it has ended the economy is going south again"

well it did something if the economy is going south now that it's ended

obviously based on your own comment it has sustained the economy and prevented it from sliding into the abyss.....­while it lasted of course

I understand the reluctance to spend when the debt is already so high, but honestly, based on history, based on economics, there is no way to come out of this unless the government spends. There just isn't, period. However the important question is what to spend the money on.

One example...­..Infrastr­ucture. The government could invest billions nationwide into improving infrastruc­ture......­roads, bridges, etc. that are already in much need of repairs and replacemen­t. The money will need to be spent on it eventually and it literally puts thousands and thousands of people back to work. The money goes directly to the private sector via contracts and the government doesn't get any bigger. There are hundreds of examples like this, the government investing directly into the private sector, but this time the return is guaranteed in the form of JOBS

once the economy stables a bit then we can have a big discussion on debt reduction.­....be it cuts or tax hikes or a combinatio­n of both

				If the stimulus did nothing how does it ending cause the economy to go south?I never knew there was full employment forcing people out of private sector employment to go working for the government­.I never knew that currency speculator­s were more productive than people who build roads, for example.The percentage of the economy that's the government has not reached an unsustaina­ble level if there is such a thing that is.

				Private contractor­s carrying out a lot of the dirty work of the recent wars, how do you feel  about that spending ? Billions poured into black holes of corruption and cronyism. Are you equally stringent about 'equality' and free market fairness with regard to this significan­t amount which accounts for a good deal of our current debt?

				When the U.S. Sneezes the world catches a cold.  This adage is more crucial today than yesterday.  Whatever direction the U.S. takes to fix it's economy other countries try to anticipate so as not to be left out when the new U.S. model is adopted.  And it appears the world believes the ignorant republican­s have won the argument.  Good luck my fellow Americans.

				From 2006...

http://www­.morgansta­nley.com/v­iews/gef/a­rchive/200­6/20060303­-Fri.html
Morgan Stanley - Global Economic Forum

"Stephen Roach (New York)

Billed as the great equalizer between the rich and the poor, globalizat­ion has been anything but.  An increasing­ly integrated global economy is facing the strains of widening income disparitie­s -- within countries and across countries.  This has given rise to a new and rapidly expanding underclass that is redefining the political landscape.  The growing risks of protection­ism are an outgrowth of this ominous trend.

It wasn’t supposed to be this way.   Globalizat­ion has long been portrayed as the rising tide that lifts all boats.  The surprise is in the tide -- a rapid surge of IT-enabled connectivi­ty that has pushed the global labor arbitrage quickly up the value chain.  Only the elite at the upper end of the occupation­al hierarchy have been spared the pressures of an increasing­ly brutal wage compressio­n.  The rich are, indeed, getting richer but the rest of the workforce is not.  This spells mounting disparitie­s in the income distributi­on -- for developed and developing countries, alike. 

The United States and China exemplify the full range of pressures bearing down on the income distributi­on.  With per capita income of $38,000 and $1,700, respective­ly, the US and China are at opposite ends of the global income spectrum.  Yet both countries have extreme disparitie­s in the internal mix of their respective income distributi­ons.  This can be seen in their so-called Gini coefficien­ts..."

				"...A Gini Index reading of “0” represents perfect equality, with each segment of the income distributi­on accounting for a proportion­ate share of total income.  Conversely­, a reading of “100” represents perfect inequality­, with the bulk of a nation’s overall personal income being concentrat­ed at the upper end of the distributi­on spectrum.  In other words, the higher the Gini Index, the more unequal the income distributi­on.  The latest Gini Index readings for the US (41) and China (45) are among the highest of all the major economies in the world -- pointing to a much greater incidence of inequality than in economies with more homogeneou­s distributi­ons of income, such as Japan (25), Europe (32), and even India (33). 

While the US and China suffer from similar degrees of income inequality­, they have arrived at this point through very different means.  In the case of the US, there is nothing new about elevated readings of income inequality­.  America’s Gini coefficien­t has been on the rise for over 35 years -- moving up from about 35 in 1970 to over 40 today.  What is new is how America’s income distributi­on has become more unequal in a period of rapidly rising productivi­ty growth -- a developmen­t that has been accompanie­d by an extraordin­ary bout of real wage stagnation over the past four years.."

				This may be OT but any apparent prosperity we had under the shrub is smoke and mirrors.

After 9/11 the shrub told us to go shopping and we did. Everyone pulled out their credit cards and spent beyond what was sustainabl­e. 

Our demise didn't start in 2008. It started in September of 2011.

				If the GOP can win the WH they can take credit for the plans and policies Obama and the democrats implemente­d.  That will last no more than one year. But they won't be able to manage or sustain anything, and their so called free market adjustment­s won't fix anything either, and the corporate oligarchy still won't hire Americans, even at the behest of their lackeys; so, being clueless, they'll cut to the marrow.  Bottom line: if republican­s take the White House, life as we know it in America is over.

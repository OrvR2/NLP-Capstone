Four techniques to shape up your bootyBy Consulting trainer Kathleen Trotter; Text by Alanna Glassman | Chatelaine – Tue, 6 Sep, 2011 12:00 AM EDT























1. Squat taps

Start with feet hip-width apart, arms parallel to floor. Sink into a squat, reaching hips back as if you're about to sit in an imaginary chair. Holding position, tap one foot back, then the other, for 15-20 reps. Do three sets.

Perfect your form: Keep stationary leg and abdominals engaged while squatting.

Dial it down: Return to standing for two seconds after every five taps.

Amp it up: Sit lower into the squat.

2. Side lunges

Begin in a wide-foot stance, arms stretched out at shoulder height. Lunge to one side, while lowering arms to touch toe in front of bending leg. Push back into starting position. Do 10 reps, then repeat on opposite leg.

Perfect your form: Make sure toes face forward, back is straight and the glute of the bending leg is over the foot.

Dial it down: Perform lunges with hands resting on your waist or decrease number of reps.

Amp it up: Hold a 2- to 5-pound dumbbell in each hand.

3. Lunge jumps

With arms in a relaxed boxer pose, lower body into a forward lunge until both legs are bent to 90 degrees. Pushing off your front foot, jump in the air, switching front and back legs. Land back in lunge with opposite foot forward. Do 10 reps.

Perfect your form: Don't let your front knee bend farther than your shoelaces.

Dial it down: Do alternating lunges without the jump.

Amp it up: Raise and lower arms each time you jump.

4. Alternating leg lifts in bridge

Lie on your back with legs bent and feet on floor. Lift hips toward the ceiling and, keeping hips raised, alternate lifting feet off the floor. Do 10 reps.

Perfect your form: Engage your core to keep hips level as you raise each foot.

Dial it down: Lower body to the ground in between each round of leg lifts.

Amp it up: Do 10 reps lifting one leg before switching to the other.

Calorie-burning bonus: Do one minute of high knee lifts between exercises.

A nice is indicates a woman is physically active and healthy.  People who have an interest in life do things, go places, are constantly moving, .  They know the exhiliration of physical exercise.

Rationalize as much as you want, a fat ass shows the person is lazy, inactive, has no zest for life.

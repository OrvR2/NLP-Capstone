Schumer: Halt funds to Libya until Lockerbie bomber jailedBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Wed, Aug 31, 2011

Seif al-Islam Gadhafi, in white, greets Lockerbie bomber Abdulbaset al-Megrahi upon his …Sen. Charles Schumer, the influential New York Democrat, is calling on the State Department to suspend aid to Libya's new Western-backed rebel government unless it agrees to re-imprison the Libyan man convicted for his role in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
"If the new Libyan government continues to shield this convicted  terrorist from justice, then they should not get one more cent of  support from the United States," Schumer said in press release Wednesday. The release was timed to accompany a separate letter from Schumer to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spelling out his demands.
"We put American lives  and money on the line to help the Libyan people secure their freedom," Schumer continued. "It's time the Libyan government lives up to its commitment to create a  free and accountable society by handing over al-Megrahi so that justice  can finally be done."
Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, a former Libyan intelligence official from a prominent Libyan tribe, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 2001 for his role in the Lockerbie bombing, which killed 259 passengers, many from New York and New Jersey, and 11 people on the ground. But two years ago, a Scottish prison board released Megrahi, having determined he was suffering from terminal cancer and had only three months to live. When Megrahi flew  back to Libya in August 2009, he was given a hero's welcome and greeted personally by Gadhafi's son Seif al-Islam. The incident was, as intended, deeply humiliating to American and British officials.
And as Megrahi has gone on to long outlive his three-month diagnosis, questions about his suspicious release have caused unusual friction in normally placid American-British relations. Last year, American lawmakers pressed for an investigation into the role that British business interests may have played in Megrahi's release. (One key target of inquiry was troubled oil giant BP, which was negotiating for energy exploration rights in Libya around the time of Megrahi's release.) The British government has strongly denied such insinuations, pointing out the independence of Scotland's judiciary, and the investigations have gone nowhere.
So far, at least, the fall of Gadhafi's government doesn't promise to clear up any of the confusion surrounding the case.  A representative of Libya's opposition National Transition Council (NTC) told journalists Sunday the rebels would not extradite Megrahi. The NTC  then reportedly backtracked, after the State Department said Monday  that it has asked the NTC to review the Megrahi case.
Meanwhile, CNN's Nic Robertson visited Megrahi at his Tripoli villa Sunday and found him at least appearing to be unconsciousness, on an IV drip, cared for by his mother. Shortly thereafter, journalists uncovered  a 2009 letter from Megrahi to Abdullah Senussi, Libya's erstwhile intelligence minister, professing innocence in the Lockerbie plot as they sifted through Senussi's abandoned offices.
In the letter, "Mr. Megrahi  blamed his conviction on 'fraudulent information that was relayed to  investigators by Libyan collaborators,'" the Wall Street Journal's Charles Levinson, Margaret Coker, and Alistair McDonald reported Tuesday. Megrahi blamed his conviction on "immoral British and American investigators" who "knew there was foul play and irregularities in the investigation  of the 1980s."
Libya analysts have suggested the NTC may be cautious about Megrahi due to its pursuit of fledgling political alliances: Megrahi is from an influential Libyan  tribe, the Magarha, that is being courted by the rebels as it had been previously by the Gadhafi regime.
Given the competing demands at play, Schumer pressed Clinton to employ one key bit of leverage the United States has with the Libyan rebels: money. In particular, Schumer urged the secretary of state to make strategic use of the billions of dollars in Libyan regime assets now  frozen in U.S. bank accounts. Last week, the UN sanctions committee agreed to unfreeze the first tranche of those funds: some $1.5 billion in U.S.-held Libyan regime assets that the new government can use to pay salaries, fuel bills, and for UN humanitarian aid programs in the country.
Washington Libya watchers say U.S. diplomacy on the matter needs to be sensitive to the domestic political demands of all the parties involved--including the brand-new Libyan rebel-democrats, as well as the U.S. lawmakers representing the families of some of the 259 passengers killed on the downed flight.
"If we choose to seek [Megrahi's] extradition, even better," said Joel Rubin, a former State Department Egypt and Libya desk officer and former Senate staffer who now heads government relations for the Ploughshares Fund, in an email to The Envoy Tuesday. "But we need to think about doing this in a manner that understands that the [NTC] is attempting to create a new Libya -- and is not the one that murdered and terrorized both Americans and Libyans ... Now that we have the chance for a new relationship, we should make our concerns both clear and in a manner that reflects these new and improved circumstances."
Secretary of State Clinton will surely be putting such a positive spin on the situation when she arrives in Paris for a meeting Thursday of the international Contact Group on Libya, the international coalition that has coordinated the intervention to date there. Meanwhile, a Justice Department spokesman told The Envoy Wednesday: "The investigation into the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 remains open.  We remain committed to pursuing justice on behalf of the victims of this tragedy."

I got a better idea. Halt aid to other countries, and instead use that money to help our own people, like all the people in NJ, upstate NY, and Vermont who are struggling after the tropical storm.

Senator Schumer, how come I never heard a word from you about this administration's tacit involvement in the release of the Lockerbie bomber and its intentional failure to demand his extradition to the U.S. to be tried for this crime? 

There is no double jeopardy if the mass murderer is convicted under Scottish law and then tried under U.S. law - they are two different countries and two different legal systems.  In fact you can be tried and convicted in the U.S. for the same crime under both state law under federal law - military members face that possibility among others.    

President Obama said he was 'surprised' by the decision to release the bomber, but the Wikileaks cables from the U.S. Embassy in London shows that this was simply not true.  The WH said - "As we have expressed repeatedly to officials of the government of the United Kingdom and to Scottish authorities, we continue to believe that Megrahi should serve out his sentence in Scotland."

It was a lie.  He know about it in detail and the U.S. had even suggested the bomber be incarcerated in a third county because Scotland was under pressure and the U.K.'s pocketbook that been threatened.

In fact even the BBC had leaked that the bomber would be released in advance.  When the Scots were backed into a political corner, they admitted that they had kept both the UK and USA fully informed of what was going on

Sorry, the White House story was one of the biggest lies of all times.  Senator Schumer. should you really let party loyalty trump justice for more than 180 Americans murdered by terrorists.  Shame on you.

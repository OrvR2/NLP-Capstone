(09-07) 18:18 PDT TIBURON -- 
A construction worker was killed when he fell from the roof of a Tiburon home and landed on his head, Marin County Sheriff's officials said Wednesday. 
Gabriel Vasquez, 53, of San Rafael, was pronounced dead Tuesday at Marin General Hospital after co-workers found him next to the house on 186 St. Thomas Way, in Tiburon. He had been working on the roof of the home shortly before 2 p.m. when he fell, investigators said.
Nobody apparently witnessed the fall, so the sheriff's department is still trying to determine how the accident occurred. 
Sgt. Keith Boyd, Marin County's assistant chief deputy coroner, said an autopsy was conducted Wednesday, but no further information will be released until toxicology studies are completed in two to four weeks.

WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security Department Secretary Janet Napolitano predicted Tuesday that airline passengers in the future will no longer be instructed to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints, but she said the technology to scan shoe-wearing passengers for bombs does not yet exist and may not be available soon.
No technology meets government standards to screen shoes for explosives at airports while passengers wear them. Officials have not been able to say for certain that this technology will exist in the future, though they are working to develop it.
Removing shoes during screening has been a common complaint among airline travelers since security was increased after a member of al-Qaida tried to detonate a bomb built into his shoe aboard an American Airlines flight in December 2001.
Napolitano said restrictions on carrying liquids on planes – imposed after another terrorist plot to detonate disguised bombs on board planes in August 2006 – probably will remain in effect.
"We'd love to have a kind of a screening portal that you just step in and, boom, it's got everything and you go through and it's painless and very, very quick," Napolitano said at a breakfast meeting organized by Politico, a Washington news organization, according to a transcript of her remarks. "The technology isn't quite there yet and it won't be for a while, but I think one of the first things you will see over time is the ability to keep your shoes on, and one of the last things you will probably see is a reduction or removing the limitation on liquids."
In July, the government announced that TSA will begin testing a program this fall with a small number of travelers who volunteer personal information. If cleared, these travelers could go through security faster – in some cases, because they won't be asked to take their shoes off. But participants still might be asked to remove their shoes, TSA Administrator John Pistole told The Associated Press.
"It makes sense to try to identify those who are willing to share information about themselves, and if we can make some judgments about them as part of this risk-based screening initiative, then perhaps one of the benefits is they can in all likelihood keep their shoes on," Pistole said.
Pistole said that TSA will always perform random and unpredictable screening, so that passengers who aren't asked to remove their shoes might be asked to remove their shoes on the next trip.
"Just to keep her guessing," he said. "The last thing we want to do is allow terrorists to game the system."

				If you x-ray a shoe made of plastic explosive, it looks like plastic. The shoe thing is a joke.   We do have something that can find explosives in shoes and in other places. It is called a dog.  We don't need big scary dogs, friendly, non threatenin­g beagles would do the trick and be a PR coup as well.  I guess there is not enough corporate profit for ex Bush admin officials in deploying beagles.  In any case your chances of being killed by terrorists are substantia­lly  less than being killed in the car on the way to the airport.  Stop being afraid and start being Americans again.

				I see you're using Bruce Schneier's concept of "Security Theater" but you're not closing the loop on the concept -- the goal is not to make travelers docile, it's to make then *feel* safe.  What keeps travelers docile is the feeling of security; things like the notion that banning outside beverages must be doing something or the TSA wouldn't do it.  These policies still exist because we're so afraid of the bogeyman of terrorism that we don't dare point out that the TSA wears no clothes.

				Yeah.  A child could tell you that it's crazy.  To borrow again from Bruce Schneier, there's no penalty for failure.  You could try to bring, say gasoline or enough ammonia and bleach to kill everyone on board, but as long as you disguised them cleverly enough, all that would happen would be confiscati­on.  No records are kept of liquid attempts either, so you could try your plot as many times as you wanted.  If you tried to bring a firearm on the plane, they would arrest you and you would likely never be allowed to fly for a very long time.  So either they're tacitly admitting that liquids aren't dangerous or someone made the rule "just to be safe" and it took on a bureaucrat­ic life of its own.

				Just came back to the US from another trip to Europe.
From the 3 countries visited - none asks the passengers to remove their shoes.
The relatively small airport in Valencia in fact had a machine for scanning the shoes but they used it only on selected passengers­. Is EU a shoes-on step ahead again? :-)

				There are about 800 million airline passengers in the US every year. If every passenger is delayed 1 minute by security measures, that adds up to 1,522 man years in delays. Assuming a life expectancy of 75 years, that means that every year, 20 lives are wasted just by delaying you a minute at the checkpoint­.

				The "remove your shoes policy" has nothing to do with security.  If it did, you can be assured that the same policy would exist in Europe.
This policy is all about putting on a show.  Keep the the fear alive because we need to justify the billions spent on TSA.  Security is a serious concern but this "shoes" policy is more of an advertisin­g campaign than a security measure.
Unfortunat­ely, we are stuck with it because no politician will risk being labeled "soft on terrorism" by abandoning this annoying but effective public relations ploy.

				Excuse me...I just posted that I broke my toe taking off my shoes at Amsterdam'­s Airport.  European airports are worse than American airports when it comes to security.  They make you undergo at least two security clearances and they do not let you take water on board - even when you cleared security.

				I always opt from the full body scanners (have done Ph.D. with X-rays to know enough).
And don't mind being touched by the officers. Neither does anyone else in my family. Our society goes way too far with the "personal space" issues. If there were more normal bodily interactio­ns among people (real hugs, handshakes etc.) no one wold be using the term "sexual molestatio­n" for the work which the officers really don't enjoy doing (I ask them every time :-). Hugs and kisses today are through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices :-)

				One out of 3 women and one of 6 men have been sexually molested (minimum).  They are easily triggered by invasive procedures and should not have to be subjected to this kind of treatment.  Also, you have not read enough about the machines. They concentrat­e in the skin (unlike medical machines).  Dermatolog­ists oppose them,and I, as a skin cancer survivor, strongly oppose them.  There is no reason to put your hand in somebody's crotch, ever, unless invited.  If you are so paranoid as to think people are walking around with diaper bombs maybe you shouldn't fly.

Video of the Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaten in Germany, which is also known as Kehlsteinhaus. Built for Hitler's 50th Birthday, it sits at 1800 metres on top of a mountain overlooking Berchtesgaten. As it turned out, Hitler was afraid of heights and only visited the house 14 times. Today it is a tourist attraction. At the end of the video is a couple of shots of the train station at Berchtesgaten, including Hitler's private terminal. Video shot on HD in 2007.

I can't imagine paying a dime, considering who it was built for and what made it's construction possible, unless EVERY dime of proceeds went to descendants of his victims, where ever they are. Otherwise, someone's being a profiteer of the Nazi﻿ legacy and the visitors are voting their acceptance of this profit, and what this place represents.....

In﻿ Deutschland, wherever two or more may gather, someone will be selling you a great beer, and maybe food. Very convenient, but sometimes messes with the atmosphere you'd like to experience.

I was there on July 4, 2007, and it snowed! Definitely the first and probably only time time I'll see﻿ snow on the Fourth.

@itsandy88 my grandad was medic and was wounded in 1944 so he didnt make it to War of Lapland but his younger brother was Finnish Waffen-SS volunteer,﻿ he was a Tankgunner and he went all way in the Kaukasus and between 1941-1942 he killed over 90 russians soldiers and over 20 tanks in Kaukasus and over 150 russians when he returned back to finland and. He got first class Iron cross and second class freedom medal. I got to keep his SS hat without the symbols

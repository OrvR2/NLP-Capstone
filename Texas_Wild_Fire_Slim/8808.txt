How Low Are Current Mortgage Rates? 3 Convincing AnswersBy Richard Barrington | Forbes – Mon, Aug 1, 2011

This post provided by Money-Rates.com.
There can be a fair amount of hype associated with products like mortgages, so when you hear a phrase like "current mortgage rates are historically low," how seriously should you take it?
It turns out that there are at least three reasons you should take it very seriously indeed. Current mortgage rates are historically low in three distinct ways:

 Current mortgage rates are barely half of their historical average. Since the early 1970s, 30-year mortgage rates have averaged 8.86 percent. Current mortgage rates, at 4.50 percent for 30 years, are just over half that average, and barely above the all-time low of 4.23 percent.
 Current mortgage rates are low compared to inflation. Like any interest rate, mortgage rates have to be considered in the context of inflation. There are, after all, two components to an interest rate: an inflation assumption, which is merely an attempt by the lender to get the same purchasing power back when the loan is repaid, and a premium over the inflation assumption, which is the real (i.e., after inflation) profit the lender hopes to earn. Historically, that premium over inflation has averaged 4.42 percent. Given the 3.6 percent inflation rate over the past year, at 4.50 percent current mortgage rates represent a premium over inflation of under 1 percent, or less than one-fourth the historical average.
 Current mortgage rates are even low relative to themselves. You have a choice between a 30-year and a 15-year mortgage. As low as current 30-year rates are, 15-year rates represent an even better bargain. Since the early 1990s, 15-year mortgages have typically been 0.46 percent lower than 30-year mortgages. Now, they are 0.83 percent lower. In no year has the discount for a 15-year mortgage exceeded an average of 0.66 percent, so 15-year mortgages are in especially rare territory right now.

If you are thinking of buying a house or refinancing a mortgage, there are many factors to consider. One thing you can be sure of, though, is that current mortgage rates really do offer an exceptional opportunity.

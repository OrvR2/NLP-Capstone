BOULDER, Colo. — Fox Sports canceled a show that aired a segment that mocked Asian students who were filmed on the University of Southern California campus.
Fox Sports Network spokesman Lou D'Ermilio said in a statement that last week's segment was "clearly offensive" and that the show "The College Experiment" would be cancelled effective immediately.
The Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder, Colo. reported ( ) about the video and the network issued an apology. The video shows a comedian approaching Asian students at USC and asking them to welcome the universities of Colorado and Utah to the Pac-12 Conference. The comedian tells the students to give the new Pac-12 members an "All-American welcome" and then mocks students' accents. http://goo.gl/RmKAE
D'Ermilio says the video was removed as soon as the network became aware of it.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.
Fox Sports is apologizing for what it calls an "inappropriate" segment filmed on the University of Southern California campus that critics say mocks Asian students.
Fox Sports Network sent the apology after the Daily Camera newspaper in Boulder, Colo., reported () about the video. It shows a comedian approaching Asian students at USC and asking them to welcome the universities of Colorado and Utah to the Pac-12 Conference. The comedian tells the students to give the new Pac-12 members an "all-American welcome" and then mocks students' accents. http://goo.gl/RmKAE
In the statement, network spokesman Lou D'Ermilio addresses the apology to USC President Max Nikias.
"We sincerely apologize to President Nikias and the entire USC community for the production and posting of the video," D'Ermilio wrote. "The context was clearly inappropriate and the video was removed as soon as we became aware of it. We will review our editorial process to determine where the breakdown occurred, and we will take steps to ensure something like this never happens again."
University of Colorado ethnic studies professor Darryl Maeda, who saw the segment, told the newspaper that the piece relies on stereotypes of Asians as "perpetual foreigners." The interviewer appeared to seek students for whom English is not their first language, he said.
"This is demeaning to millions of Asian Americans who have put down deep roots in the United States, claim English as their language and root vigorously for their favorite sports teams," Maeda said.
CU's football team hosts the USC Trojans on Nov. 4. CU and Utah entered the Pac-12 in July.

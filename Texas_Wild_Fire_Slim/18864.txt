Cal Fire Stations and Camps Mapped On Google Earth
2 comments






WildlandFire.com has mapped out the location of each Cal Fire station and camp on Google Earth and Google Maps.
Cal Fire Stations On Google Earth
The viewer can zoom in to individual properties where an information filled pop up describes Long/Lat, station name, address and an image of the station or activities associated with the station or camp. For instance, below is a close up look at Rancheria Station near O’Neals in the central Sierra foothills.
Cal Fire Rancheria Station, O'Neals California, Central Sierra Foothills
Zoom out and you see Rancheria Station and its proximity to other Cal Fire stations, air attack bases and the closest camps.

WildlandFire.com invites readers with local knowledge to help edit details and add images of individual properties.
In addition to Cal Fire Stations and camps they offer similar KMZ files for California County Agencies/CalFire Contracted, US Forest Service North and South Zones and California BLM NPS BIA FWS.
Follow the link at the top for all KMZ files offered by Wildland Fire.
Bravo to WildlandFire.com for bringing us this most useful tool.

Forest Service Cover-Up of “Monumental Error” Alleged; L.A.Times
2 comments






According to the L.A. Times Station Fire commanders failed to call in available air resources on day two of the fire.
Had dispatchers followed through and ordered air tankers, sitting idle in nearby bases, the fire could have been hooked in the early stages, possibly held to a few thousand acres. The fire burned more than 140,000 acres and ended as the fifth largest wildfire in California history.
Disturbingly Cal Fire’s air attack plane, a quarterback in the sky flew overhead on day two and waited for air tankers that never arrived. According to the Times article the morning of day two Cal Fire Air Attack only had one helicopter to direct on the the rapidly growing blaze below.
Much “he said, she said” is taking place in the aftermath as to who ordered or did not order air resources, hence the cover-up allegations.
The crux of the issue is money. Air tankers are expensive. Air tankers also kill fire. In a Forest Service culture where fire is not always a bad thing, read overtime, forest management combined with the reality of pinched budgets it is easy to see how a decision could be made to keep air tankers away.
There are two wildland firefighting cultures at work in California. One is Cal Fire, the state wildland fire force, and the other if the U.S Forest Service. Cal Fire attacks fires with the intent of putting them out as quickly as possible, even beyond initial attack. The Forest Service will attack a fire but has no problem backing off once the initial attack phase ends.
The best comparison between the two cultures took place in 2008. One only has to compare the Basin Complex, a Forest Service fire that devastated Big Sur and the Telegraph Fire, a Cal Fire show.
The differences lie within.
Forest Service and Cal Fire firefighters are equally competent. Both forces are full of dedicated professionals. It’s the difference in fire culture that separates the two entities and it’s been that way for decades.
What the L.A. Times found out about the Station Fire is not at all surprising.

Grass Curing, Alerts up!
Comments Off






Big Sur Kate alerted her readers earlier today + Cal Fire moving air tankers to Northern California bases.
Per NOAA: “HAVE UPGRADED THE FIRE WEATHER WATCH TO A RED FLAG WARNING FOR ZONE 511. THIS COVERS THE EAST BAY HILLS AND INLAND HILLS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY ABOVE 1000 FEET. INTEL FROM LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCIES IS THAT GRASSES BETWEEN 1000-2000 FEET ARE CURED AND WILL CARRY FIRE IN WINDY ENVIRONMENT…THE SACRAMENTO OFFICE ISSUED RED FLAGS FOR THE ENTIRE SAC VALLEY SO WINDY WEATHER WILL BE FELT IN THE DELTA AND OUR FAR EAST BAY VALLEYS AS WELL. FAIR AMOUNT OF PRESCRIBED BURNING AS WELL AS HEADING INTO A HOT WEEKEND RAISES CONCERNS. SPC HAS OUR AREA HIGHLIGHTED IN A CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER THREAT. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH SEVERAL OF THE RECORD HIGHS FOR TODAY ONLY GO BACK TO 2008 WHEN A SIMILAR SYNOPTIC PATTERN TOOK HOLD. JUNE 10TH IS THE DATE THE INDIANS FIRE STARTED IN MONTEREY COUNTY UNDER A SIMILAR WEATHER PATTERN WITH AN UNSEASONABLY STRONG TROUGH OVER THE GREAT BASIN WITH FAVORABLE WIND FLOW ALOFT FOR CREATING STRONG NORTH/NORTHEAST WINDS IN THE HILLS.”
My venture into the central Sierra’s last weekend confirmed we are not yet ready above 3,000 ft.. There is plenty of green around and above Mariposa and Oakhurst. The Central Valley and lowland valleys in SoCal have already burned. 5oo acres of grass rangeland burned near La Grand in Merced County and 300 acres burned in Stanislaus County near Patterson. Both fires were on the valley floor near sea level. It’s a late start in the foothills no doubt but the fuel loads throughout the state is heavy. Once this drys out, watch out.
Nice to see NOAA remembering the Indians Fire of 2008. No one thought that would blow up like it did….

From the Inbox, Links and Points of Interest
2 comments






One of the very cool things about operating this blog is the interesting  information that appears in my inbox from time to time.
For instance Jenny from the P.R. Dept at Boston University sent me a link to this fantastic project undertaken by two Boston University alums Kristie Eden O’Donnell and Anya Smolnikova. Well done ladies. The Huntington Avenue firehouse in Boston is better for your efforts.
Monte Stonewall forwarded a list of “famous/infamous” arsonists. Most are well known but I did not know the murderous “Son of Sam” was also an arsonist, not surprised really.
Novelist Kurt Kamm pointed me to two of his books, “One Foot In The Black” and “Red Flag Warning”. I am very much looking forward to reading them both over the summer.  Book reviews to follow.

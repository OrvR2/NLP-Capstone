Jan. 26, 2011 — WIMBERLEY, Texas — Residents in the area around Hays and Comal counties interested in learning how to protect themselves from wildfire are invited to a town hall meeting on Feb. 10.The gathering is set for 6:30 p.m. at the Wimberley Community Center, 14068 Ranch Road 12. Representatives from Texas Forest Service and the National Fire Protection Association will be on hand to answer questions and talk about what you can do to protect your home and family from wildfire. For example, you can reduce potential wildfire losses by adopting Firewise landscaping practices 100 to 200 feet around your home. That includes moving firewood and clearing dead and dense vegetation.Wildland Urban Interface Specialist Jan Fulkerson stressed that wildfires are a community-wide problem, which means reducing risks to homes and property is everyone’s responsibility.“More than 80 percent of wildfires in Texas occur within 2 miles of a community,” Fulkerson said, reminding residents that wildfires have raged through the three counties before and likely will again. “We want to encourage residents to take proactive measures that could end up saving lives and property.”For more information, visit www.texasfirewise.org.  Meeting Details:What: Town hall meeting – Firewise principlesWhen: Thursday, Feb. 10, at 6:30 p.m.Where: Wimberley Community Center, 14068 Ranch Road 12, Wimberley, TexasContact:Jan Fulkerson, Wildland Urban Interface Specialist979-220-1010, jfulkerson@tfs.tamu.eduWriter: April Saginor, Communications Specialist979-458-6619 office, 979-255-0591 cell, asaginor@tfs.tamu.edu

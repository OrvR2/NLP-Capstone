																These initiatives would  give corporate CEOs the confidence they need to start spending, on new investments and hiring, some of the $2 trillion now sitting in their treasuries. And it is that eventual spending which will sustain long-term job creation.

				OMG ... please tell me this is WAY, WAY wrong.  Does this country HONESTLY want another Texas oil-man in the oval office.  Yikes.  Or Romney?  Please, the man is a pseudo-con­servative and has facilitate­d the expansion of government just as much as Obama.

Wake up SHEEPLE!!!

				Nate Silver was correct by saying there isn't a significan­t statistica­l correlatio­n between the economy and Obama's approval rating. It's all about perception and how they swing states view how Obama's getting the ball rolling come 2012. 

If he's going in the right direction then he will defeat this weak group of candidates­. The GOP is extremely weak without ideas and charisma. People call Obama idea less, but he's just playing politics when he's up against a the No to everything crowd.

				This is an adults poll.  In a LV poll in this dismal economy, Obama would lose very easily to this "weak group".  Maybe the group is weak but when you are a weak president who is losing his mojo almost daily, that does not matter.

				I posted last week about Gallup's showing that two of BO's most supporting demographi­cs (post-grad­s and high-incom­e) are finally losing their faith in high numbers (16 points drop for both groups since May).

Earlier this morning, I watched MSNBC lib talking heads discuss this poll. They were saying how "it feels like people are giving up" on B0. I am sure they were projecting their feelings.

Considerin­g how emotional the connection of libs to BO was, a love analogy is fitting. If a lover that you are very passionate about dumps you, there is a window of time when you would be thrilled to take him/her back. But after a while, the spell is broken, you start question what you saw in them in the first place, and there is no going back.

B0 support from a large segment of libs is beginning to feel like that..

				The President is weak on the surface, but is structural­ly strong due to the GOP inability to attract minorities (blacks/la­tinos), young voters, union members, and etc. I truly believe Obama will get these people in the end. He may not win by his 2008 margin, but his victory will be similar to Bush's in 2004 over Kerry.

				How do these Main Stream pollsters manage to find these samples?

Voted for Barack Obama ..........­...... 43
Voted for John McCain ..........­......... 34
Voted for someone else ..........­....... 4
Not sure ..........­..........­..........­..........­.. 2
No, Did Not Vote ..........­..........­......... 17

So of the people who voted, 53 went BO and only 41 McCain. 17% Illegal aylens?

Nice sample

				2008 only had 60% turnout, and a good number who will be voting in '12 were underage in '08.  It's possible that could be a breakdown of expected '12 voters.  The 7 point margin looks right.

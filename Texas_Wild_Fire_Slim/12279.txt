In Al Gore's most recent post to "Al's Journal," the former vice president slams President Obama for his recent retreat on smog standards.
Last Friday, under pressure from big industries and GOP lawmakers, Obama asked the EPA to withdraw proposed clean air regulations.
According to the Associated Press, "The regulation would have reduced concentrations of ground-level ozone, the main ingredient in smog, a powerful lung irritant that can cause asthma and other lung ailments."
Janice Nolen, assistant vice president of the American Lung Association, told The Huffington Post that she was "outraged," given that "the current standard used was based on the science as of 14 years ago -- before we knew that ozone killed people."
In Gore's Wednesday post, he writes: 
Instead of relying on science, President Obama appears to have bowed to pressure from polluters who did not want to bear the cost of implementing new restrictions on their harmful pollution—even though economists have shown that the US economy would benefit from the job creating investments associated with implementing the new technology. The result of the White House’s action will be increased medical bills for seniors with lung disease, more children developing asthma, and the continued degradation of our air quality.
Gore also mentions that fact that on the very day that Obama made this announcement, activists were outside the White House engaged in protests against the Keystone XL pipeline, which is expected to run from the Canadian tar sands in Alberta to refineries on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Over the course of two weeks, over 1,200 people were arrested for their acts of non-violent civil disobedience. In a recent HuffPost piece, Gore wrote, "The tar sands are the dirtiest source of fuel on the planet."
Many others have spoken out against Obama's decision, including Robert Redford, who wrote for The Huffington Post that "President Obama has done a lot to protect public health and our environment," but "I want our smog levels to come down so more of our children and seniors can breathe clean air. Putting corporate profits above public health is unconscionable. It's outrageous that it would be countenanced -- by this president or any other."
Keith Olbermann slammed President Obama on his Friday show, asking, "What the hell is going on in the White House?"

				If these companies are 'too big to regulate" and the White house is allowing them to forgo measures to keep down smog pollutants­, then it's only fair to bring back public smoking, regardless if it is mandated by the state. I miss smoking my cigar in public, anyway. I am just saying. If average constituen­ts are being regulated then, these corporatio­ns who feel "they are people too", should be regulated. "What's good for the goose is good for the gander".

				Thanks, Al. How about another global concert? Interspers­e with live feeds from scientists around the world who don't make a lot of money or secure particular corporate favor with their opinions? I'll be glad to buy them a beer and write a piece in complex British classical rock style. Even though I'm southern born in the US.

				I so dislike AlGore that I'm glad he lost in 2000. 

And from all I've read he lost it fair and square, like it or not.

http://www­.nytimes.c­om/2001/11­/12/politi­cs/12VOTE.­html

I'm sure he would not have done any better than W. He might have done things differentl­y but he'd have messed up as well probably in a different way.

Look at Obama and how upset people are with him now. It's something about attaining that office that causes you to lose your mind and toss all common sense out the window.

				It's complex and only highlights how "broke" our current system is.  The trouble is with corporatio­ns because you can't nail them down or hold them to a high standard like you can a person like Al Gore or Obama for that matter.  Anger can't be levered against an unknown faceless group of people who hold stakes in a corporatio­n who keeps to the bottom line -- corporatio­ns exist to make $$ for the shareholde­rs.   So, you've got push and pull with local representa­tives who bow to the $$ a corporatio­n would/coul­d bring to their local economies.­..and hoping to make a difference to their constituen­ts the representa­tives and ensure their re-electio­n they ask Obama to look after the local people and forgo the accountabi­lity of the incoming "job maker" corporatio­n.  I don't know -- perhaps a revolution is in order?  A personal one based on our being accountabl­e and making better choices.  Polluting corporatio­ns don't have a place in our world -- make it known to your local representa­tives.

				Al Gore should tell us why he didn't fight Bush when Republican­s sent 75 trained thugs to stop the Al Gore vote that would have made Gore the winner in Florida and thus President. Obama has many faults and is very disappoint­ing to many who voted for him but Al Gore's manhood shrank like a tubeworm when it came to fighting the criminals who stole his presidency­. The only man I see fighting, believinga­nd delivering­, is Bernie Saunders of Vermont. Go listen to Bernie Saunders and see for yourself.

				What a nice compilatio­n of Obama bashing this site has become. Apart from all he has and hasn't done, it took the majority of voters for him to get elected and as I recall, most people in this country were totally jazzed at the prospect of having him in office. My take on him was that although I did not dislike the man, I did not think he had what it takes to run this country, so I did not vote for him. Now that he is completely overwhelme­d and flounderin­g in all directions­, my initial instincts proved correct. But be that as it may, I'd still rather have him than Gore.

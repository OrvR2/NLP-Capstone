Meet Elizabeth Emken (R CAND, CA-11).

The district is listed as competitive by Cook (R+1, Leans Democratic) and is one of the districts threatened by the infamous delta smelt.  Elizabeth recently also made a Daily Beast list of 11 GOP women candidates to watch.

Elizabeth’s site can be found here.

Soccer Hero.

I refuse to call it ‘football,’ since I am a cultural chauvinist.  And I am a little skeptical of encouraging such goings-on among Americans, given that I firmly believe that world geopolitical security is enhanced by there being at least one sport out there where quite tiny nations can beat the USA like a drum*.  Still: this is an impressive enough stunt:

Well done, guys.
Moe Lane
*There is no contradiction between the two statements.
THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION!  I AM NOT LISTENING!  LALALA… (more…)

Book of the Week: Sh*t My Dad Says.

I am picking Sh*t My Dad Says for one reason and one reason alone: I cannot believe that this earned a book contract, but I have to respect that.  Besides, it’s this or a I-got-nothing:  it’s a day late already.
Farewell, Omnitopia Dawn…

#rsrh “The Band Played ‘Waltzing Matilda.’”

They only ask that we make it be worth it.

Moe Lane
PS: I know, Canadian/Australian… but surely first cousins count, yes?

I sort of agree with Eleanor Clift.

(H/T: Hot Air Headlines) On at least one passage, at least.  She wrote an article for Newsweek (yeah, it’s still publishing! Good show, that) where she assured her readers that of course they don’t need to worry about the 2010 election shellacking that the Democrats will be getting in the Senate, because a lot of those elections will be one-offs:
This is an off-year election, and there’s no popular politician with  coattails to ride, but the voters are restive, and that’s always  dangerous for the party in power.
‘Off-year election.’  Hey!  You mean, like 2006′s was?  And like 2014′s is going to be*?
Moe Lane
*You have to think of these things in the long-term, that’s all that I’m saying.  Just about everything that’s true about the 2010/2016 dynamic is going to be equally true for the 2006/2012 one.

Obama’s America.

(Via @thebcast) Personally, I get a Not-My-Kind-Of-People vibe off of the British Petroleum protesters, and I’m pretty sure that most of them would look at me and cordially hate my guts.  Doesn’t mean I like seeing ‘em get kicked by the LAPD.  Or seeing somebody filming the kicking go get tackled and arrested by the LAPD.

Hey!  Was this the change that you were waiting for?

Israel intercepts Gaza blockade runners: 14 dead.

The Israelis are very, very serious about maintaining  said blockade:
At least 14 people were killed and 50 were  injured early  Monday as the Israeli Navy took over the ships taking  part in the aid  sail to Gaza, Arab and Turkish media reported.
The IDF reported that four soldiers were injured during the takeover   from live ammunition and knife stabbing. One of the troops was said to   be in serious condition and three in light to moderate condition. The   injured were evacuated to the Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer   by helicopter.
According to an IDF source, “The sail’s participants were not   innocent and used violence against the soldiers. They were waiting for   the forces’ arrival.”

‘Kung Fu Fighting.’

You know how you only know that song from it being used for other videos?

Kung Fu Fighting, Carl Douglas
Yeah.  Well.  There’s a reason for that.  On the bright side, Amazon tells me that this guy parleyed his one-hit wonder career into a profitable production company, so go Carl Douglas.

State of the Race: Rick Barber (Al-02).

The primary for Alabama is Tuesday, so we checked in with Rick Barber to find out the state of the race:

I also asked Rick (like Hot Air Greenroom’s Laura Curtis) why Alabama’s commercials have been so memorable this cycle.  Listen for the answer, of course.
Rick’s site is here.

#rsrh I’m not a Nazi, NBC12 – Phoenix.

(Via Ed Driscoll) And it offends me that your reporter let that racist bigot use her sign to accuse me – and roughly half the country, as well as the roughly three-fifths of the country who support measures like SB 1070 – of being one without even noting it in passing.

It doesn’t surprise me, but it offends me.
Moe Lane
PS: By the way: garbage like this is shoving people like me – who actually do want comprehensive immigration reform – towards taking a harder line on the issue.

‘He was supposed to be competent.’  Wait, what?

That’s the title of a Peggy Noonan piece, and Joy McCann (Little Miss Attila) has some comments about the stars – or scales – falling from Peggy’s eyes:
…she, Ann Althouse, and Megan McArdle will  have to deal with it for the rest of their lives. Those three women have  all been an intellectual blessing to public discourse in this country,  but they all succombed to the same cult of personality two years ago,  and we still do not know what the final price tag on that cult of  personality is going to be.
Well, Megan’s off of my Elections Have Consequences list… but, yeah, Joy’s right: the people who bought into the President’s cult of personality are going to have to deal with that eventually.
Personal reminiscence after the fold. (more…)

9/11: A Conspiracy Beyond Theory
Wake up people. Stop referring to the truth as a conspiracy.
With the ten year anniversary coming up, increasingly Israel’s hand is seen in 9/11, not just from conspiracy websites or “Jew haters” but from top analysts
BY WAY OF DECEPTION WE MAKE WAR -- MOSSAD
Dogma of New World Order (NWO) conceived by Zionists and neo-cons Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz and Dick Cheney in 1990 presented Islam as the chief threat to western capitalist system and the US uni-polarism after the fall of Soviet inspired communism.

   If you do not believe that 9/11 was  an inside job and you are convinced that 19 young arabs can out-smart and out-wit the most sophisticated intelligence in the world.... think again.

this attack was planned along with the financial meltdown.  by the numbers.

1999 here we find 666 upside down.  in masonic tradition to 'form' a 6 & 9 are the same.
1999 they would tweek their guided munitions after spending a couple years prior digitally mapping serbia and bomb belgrade and serbia back to the stone age.

1999 would find clinton signing the larry summers written Gramm Leach Bailey act which destroyed the glass steagle act of 1933 and led directly to the housing bubble of 2007.  they ( obama or anyone else) has still not repealed it.  It led to the derivative fraud which the whole of the worlds economies are now imploding upon.  a GIANT ponzi scheme of artificial paper debt.

999 would become to be used by the first nation in the world in 1937 as an emergency phone number.  Great Britain. and in a very odd way I'm still researching 999 is added 27 when added again becomes a 9 or upside down  "6."

322 under the Bush Yale Skull and bone head bumch  mysterious number is not so mysterious after all. under their skull and bones ( pirates I tell ya!) is the number 322.
well 3 X 22 is ? 66. ( here is where the plot thickens watson)

3 X 666 = 1998 subtracting '66' years one arrives at the victory of Adolph Hitler in 1932. he would be installed on jan 31, of?  19 "33'

now 2 X 33 degree's a mason is?  66

folks all documented in the video "loose chnge' for anyone to see on google video or you tube.  also 'the road to tyranny'.  want the numbers? that is my research.
septermber11th, 2001 just so happened to be the '6'0th anniversary of the pentagon which finds ground breaking beginning on September 11th, 1941.  Ground breaking is a masonic event especially if one is breaking ground for a PENTAGRAM~
Let's find more 6's.

911 becomes an emergency phone number

How to kick off an Orwellian 1984 never ending war.  First create the problem and blame it on someone else.  Then 'they' the public say's "we have to do something about this."  Then they who have created the problem provide the solution to the very problem which they have created.  
Ben Franklin:  "those who choose security over liberty desever neither."  Enter the Patriot Act ( sounds all patriot but is not) and new agencies such as HLSecurity and the TSA.  Bomb Tora Bora..then off to Iraq who had nothing whatsoever to do with 911 commiting war crimes upon war crimes costing the Iraqi people close to a million dead civilians...then off to afganistan where now  the world supply of opium/heroin derives a 90% origen from.  In 2001 it accounted for merely 10%.
Now it's time to demonize Libya and go after Ghadafy's oil and resources ( gold to) and commit more war crimes in the name of protecting the civilian population, instead bombing a childrens hospital killing 50 children.
on and on and on and on and on...the beat goes on.

What a PROPAGANDA MACHINE.

Since America has decide to add an additional holiday to the many, let me be the first to say, Happy 911 Day. 

Just in time for Christmas, No, I mean 911.

Sheeple, Wake up America, it is time to wake up, poor America has been sleeping for the past 10 years, do you recognize your America today. All because of a small group of EVIL DOERS.

They, these EVIL DOERS, they were successful, they brought down those towers, they destroyed your economy, they even were able to evict many of you from your homes, they took away your jobs. They, the EVIL DOERS won on that day, known as 911.

Your bank accounts are drained, your IRA sucks, no more stock portfolio, all of this occurred due to the EVIL DOERS. 

The axis of EVIL did this to you and you know their faces, BUSH, CHENEY, RICE.

All the while your government has tried to blame that rag-tag group of misfits called the Al Qaeda. The question is, What are YOU going to do about these EVIL DOERS?

There's a great series on the Impact of 9/11 by Mathew Morgan. Some of the Sample chapters belonging to the series are posted on a scholarly 9/11 Forum from Palgrave Macmillan.

Are the children going to be taught that prior to WTC 1, 2 and 7 there was never an instance of a steel skyscraper collapsing due to fire? Are the children going to be taught that the collapses all have visual evidence of controlled demolition? Are the children going to be taught about nanothermite? Are we going to teach the children that the flight data recorder information does not match the flight data presented by the NTSB? Can we explain to the children how someone who could barely pass flight school could control a jumbo jet with the experience and maneuvers of a seasoned fighter pilot?

No, I didn't think so...

Living abroad, I find there is little or no lasting impact overseas.  America's image in a post 9/11 world has dimmed mostly because of Bush's invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.  Also, the specter of so-called 'security' imposed by America on the rest of the world is almost an embarrassment.  Many people think that what's saddest is that America flopped in dealing with a host of issues after 9/11 and that Americans allowed their government to drag them into an incredible amount of debt by financing a war with borrowed money.

The 9/11 attack happened as a terrorist attack on the United States from foreign extremists. Saying otherwise is a blatant ignorance of logic, a disregard of empirical facts, and an insult to the many Americans that lost their lives that day. Conspiracy theories are for people that get too exited about ghost stories and hate to deal with complexities of reality.

Wow, really?  Conspiracy theorists over this?  9/11 wasn't faked or planned by the US!  It happened.  What you post here, in blatent disregard to your country is blasphemous...Thank a US soldier for your freedom to be an idiot!

Larry Silverstein admits on taped they "pulled" #7, last I checked a taped confession counts as evidence. So we know from larry's own words, that the governments account of #7 IS FALSE. Kind of makes me wonder about the other two buildings which came down the same way. Small fires on the upper levels weakened EVERY INCH OF STEEL IN THE BUILDINGS RIGHT DOWN TO GROUND LEVEL CAUSING EVERY INCH OF STEEL TO GIVE OUT AT ONCE ELIMINATING ALL RESISTANCE????? I guess there's no more need to use explosives to demolish buildings, simply light a small fire near the top and the building will freefall into a neat little pile for you right?? If you buy that BS you are completely brainless.

Nov. 5, 2007 – COLLEGE STATION, Texas—Texas Forest Service (TFS), well known for its role in protecting and sustaining the state’s forest resources, has added a new dimension to its responsibilities—verifier of forestry offset projects for landowners seeking to sell their trees’ carbon credits on the open market.
The agency was notified Nov. 2 by the Chicago Climate Exchange® (CCX®) of its application’s approval, making TFS the first state forestry agency in the nation to become an Authorized Verifier for Forestry Offset Projects. The CCX® is currently the only market that trades forestry carbon.
Landowners are realizing that in addition to the value of the timber, the carbon stored in their forests has economic and environmental value as well. In order to sell the carbon credits however, landowners must first go through a multi-step process, one of which is to quantify the amount of carbon stored in their trees.
“As a CCX-approved verifier, Texas Forest Service’s role is to verify the quantity of the carbon stored in a landowner’s forest stand,” said Burl Carraway, manager of the TFS Sustainable Forestry Program.
The agency’s new responsibility is part of its ongoing exploration into the emerging forestry ecosystem services arena and is an integral part of its mission to sustain the state’s healthy forest resources for current and future generations. Additional information about ecosystem services and carbon credits for landowners.

   PROJECT HOPE Announces Successful Operation to Separate Conjoined Babies in ChinaPRWeb – 10 hrs ago





   Medical team at Shanghai Children’s Medical Center is making history again in high stakes procedure.Millwood, VA (PRWEB) September 07, 2011  A successful operation to separate four-month-old conjoined twin girls in China is spotlighting the pioneering work of US humanitarian organization Project HOPE, which trained the medical team that conducted the high stakes procedure.
The six-hour operation went ahead at Shanghai Children's Medical Center (SCMC), which was established with the support of the Virginia-based NGO, Project HOPE, and its mission of forging lasting health care around the world.
Chief Pediatric Surgeon, Dr. Chen Qi Ming, cardiovascular surgeon and SCMC President, Dr. Liu  Jinfen, and their medical team operated to separate twin girls “An An” and “Xin Xin” who were born in April, connected at the liver and pericardium -- the sac the contains the heart.
“The wonderful medical team at SCMC made history by operating on the twin baby girls -- the third set of conjoined twins who underwent this procedure successfully at SCMC.  Project HOPE is also very proud to share in this achievement as all of the clinicians and nurses who participated in the surgery and clinical care were HOPE-trained fellows,” said Lily Hsu, of Project HOPE in Shanghai. 
The Shanghai Children’s Medical Center is one of the world’s premier pediatric heart centers, performing lifesaving heart surgery on nearly 2,500 children each year.  Project HOPE helped develop the facility, which opened in 1998,  and has provided more than $30 million in medical equipment. HOPE continues to support SCMC through at least 16 training programs for professional health care workers in the areas of diabetes, children’s nutrition, HIV/AIDS and nurse training.
"This intricate surgery is another indication of how Project HOPE's mission of training local doctors, nurses and health professionals can offer the gift of life for generations to come," said John P. Howe III, M.D. and President and CEO of Project HOPE.
"It also shows how cooperation between US-based groups and Chinese authorities can create expertise and enhance public health in fast emerging China."
Project HOPE has been involved in efforts to improve the health of communities in China for more than 28 years through a strong partnership with the Ministry of Health in addressing needs and advancing health professional training with the support of corporate partners.  China’s large population, diverse demography, and rapid economic development have had a major impact on the needs for and distribution of health care services.   
About Project HOPE
Founded in 1958, Project HOPE (Health Opportunities for People Everywhere) is dedicated to providing lasting solutions to health crises, with the mission of helping people to help themselves. Identifiable to many by the SS HOPE, the world’s first peacetime hospital ship, Project HOPE now conducts land-based medical training and health education programs in 35 countries across five continents.

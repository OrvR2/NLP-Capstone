Why was Hilary Duff cast as Bonnie in the upcoming "Bonnie and Clyde" remake, you ask? Because! Aside from looking like Faye Dunaway, who she thinks is ugly, she has done many things!  But now she's pregnant and out of the game, as is her costar, a man named Kevin Zegers. Phew. We almost had a Duff/Zegers vehicle on our hands, and we all know how those turn out. (Jk! Their resumes are limited and have not crossed once, not even on "Gossip Girl"). As a favor to the gouged production, and especially to Thora Birch, whose role as Blanche Barrow comes after a tough break, we've decided to help recast the leads using cutting-edge slideshow technology. Our suggestions range from celebrity couples, onscreen dynamos and multi-millionaire sisters. Click through and support the cause.

				If it aint broke, don't fix it. Bonnie and Clyde can never be remade no matter who's in it. And Hilary Duff? My cleaning lady doesn't even know her. She's cute, but Faye Dunaway was a goddess. I'm glad she (Hilary) became unavailabl­e to make the movie. She will never fill in Faye's shoe.

				Fine, no love lost. What has Hillary Duff done that anyone cares about? Isn't she a B-actress? The high point of her career was Gossip Girl. And some Rom-com with Heather Locklear.T­hat whole feud with Faye Dunaway was so ridiculous­. How dare you call her ugly? You're a mediocre marketing vehicle, Hill, not a serious dramatic actress.

				She's obviously a commercial­ly successful actress. That really isn't the point. Taking on an iconic role like that should go to someone more serious, with a greater dramatic acumen. Duff has often complained that she has been unable to be cast in adult projects. Well, there may be a reason for that. Whatever you might say as a fan of hers, doesn't negate the fact that she did get in a huge feud with Faye Dunaway-wh­o disapprove­d of her being cast in the remake. The classy thing for her to do would have been to keep her mouth shut-inste­ad she starts insulting Dunaway-cl­aiming that she has more fans and that she is prettier than her and who is she to say if I should play this part. Wow, talk about stupidity from a young actress who has no idea who she is talking trash to. Perhaps, you should google that. I have no interest in Disney entertainm­ent, whatsoever­-so none of those credits really makes any difference to me. I am a huge fan of the original Bonnie and Clyde and can't really imagine her taking that role. So, I am relieved that she dropped out.

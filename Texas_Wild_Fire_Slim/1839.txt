Should food stamps be redeemable at Taco Bell?The Week – 19 hrs ago





Fast-food chains are lobbying the government for permission to accept food stamps. Not on your life, say anti-obesity advocatesWith government-issued food-stamp benefits more than doubling — to $64.7 billion — between 2005 and 2010, more and more businesses are trying to get in on the action. Outside of a few states, restaurants traditionally have been excluded. But now Yum! Brands, owner of Taco Bell, KFC, Long John Silver's, and Pizza Hut, is lobbying for permission to let people use food stamps at its fast-food outlets. While, anti-hunger advocates like the idea, anti-obesity activists deplore it. Should the 45 million Americans who receive food stamps be allowed to spend them on fast food? Obviously not:  This "horrible idea" is a "public health disaster" in the making, says Kim Conte at The Stir. By encouraging low-income Americans to eat unhealthy food, the government would essentially be subsidizing obesity and spending important funds inefficiently: "Prepared restaurant food costs a lot more money (and food stamps)" than staples such as beans, fruits, vegetables, and rice. "Should the government pay for us to eat fast food?" For those who can't cook, this would be a godsend:  There's no denying that fast food, with its high fat, salt, and sugar content, isn't the most nutritious fare around, says Sam Taxy at Care2. But more states should take advantage of an exception in federal rules, and let homeless or elderly people who can't cook at home buy restaurant food. Let's take this opportunity to be sure that these hungry people aren't falling through the cracks."Fast-food chains lobby states for food stamp allowances" The only question should be whether it helps people in need:  In these hard times, more and more Americans are "teetering off the edge of the lower-middle class and into destitution," says The Inquisitr. And while we grant bailouts to billionaires, some people still "nitpick" about what little we spend helping the poor. Let's not wring our hands over the fact that some people would rather spend food stamps on fried fish or chicken than something they could cook at home. Let's just make sure they don't go hungry."Food stamps at restaurants: Should low-income users have the option?"View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:Opinion Brief: Can Domino's Pizza reinvent itself?Opinion Brief: The McItaly burger uproarInstant Guide: The great shamrock shortage of 2010Like on Facebook - Follow on Twitter - Sign-up for Daily Newsletter

I'm on food stamps.  I get $200.00 a month.  If I wen an bought crab legs and shrimp, I would be starving half the month.  I go to a ghetto grocery store where they sell damaged or off brand stuff.  I can live just fine off of that.  Yes I am looking for a job because I know I won't be getting food stamps and unemployment forever.

It's bad enough watching the Mexicans ahead of me in line at the store load up on steak, chips and soda pop - then pay cash for their beer and cigarettes!  I can't afford to eat steak, can you?  These leeches have plenty of cash to pay for their beer and smokes, along with their cell phones and iPods.  The whole SNAP program is a joke.  I've seen people buy the bottled water that's on sale, go out into the parking lot and dump the water then return the empties for beer money.  Doesn't the government have those stockpiles of tasty cheese anymore?

Letting food stamps be used to purchase fast food would only lead to children still not getting the food they need.  It cost a lot more to buy fast foods than going to the grocery store and buying bulk food to last a whole week for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

No fast food for SNAP users.  No soda, no junk food, no candy.  Make them buy food with it.  If you want to make the argument that they cannot cook then fine.  But limit it to prepared foods at a supermarket.

Ok welcome to 2011.  I can only speak for NYS, but here the maximum a single person can get on food stamps (SNAP) is $200.00 per month.  And you need to have ZERO income to get that much.  That means no cash coming in at all.  

You don't get paper stamps you get a debit card that has a balance loaded on it.  Your photo is on the card and there is a PIN that you have to key in at the point of sale.  You really can't trade it because the other person would have your card and your PIN.  Granted there are ways to sell it, but the other person cannot get cash for it, and if they buy food on it they cannot get cash back on a refund either.  

Homeless people are known to buy soda though and pour the cans out and bring back the cans for money to get some cheap wine with.

Should foodstamp recipients be allowed to continue to bring children into this world knowing they have absolutely no means of raising these children except with Government handouts?

Do away with food stamps and go back to the commodities program...give away healthy food that has to be cooked, track it, make sure the people who get it are in need...this would keep helping the farmers and if you don't know how to cook, either learn or go hungry.

Food stamps need to be totally revamped.  Replace it with a debit card, one where every purchase is tracked by the government.  Any business that accepts food stamps must comply with what the government deems acceptable purchases (no king crab legs, no prime rib).  Of course the gov needs to make a list of what is allowed and what isn't.  That by itself would stop fraud and people selling stamps for cash and drugs.

Once in place it could easily be set up so people on stamps could dine out once a week.  Because it's a simple credit type card it could be made in a way that people wouldn't have to identify themselves as being on food stamps.  It would either decline them if they tried using it twice a week or a warning could be sent to them for the first mistake.

Mark my words this date & time, very soon you will see either a House of Reps. congressman or a Senator float a bill to make this travesty happen.  The fast food industry lobby will be bribing (Making campaign contributions) and we all know what happens when a lobbyist waves money in front of a politician!!!  Also, has anyone ever wondered why "Poor" people tend to be overweight, fat or obese?  Generally, it's because they are too lazy or stupid to cook nutritional meals.  This slick, transparent effort by the fast food industry is a good example of the unimitigated corporate greed that infects our country.  Citizens should boycott every one of these corporate thugs.

They shouldn't be redeemable at Taco Bell in part because there would be no delineation keeping them from redeeming them at Red Lobster or Ruth's Criss Steakhouse and that would REALLY be annoying since I'm one of the 40% of the voting public that actually pays taxes.

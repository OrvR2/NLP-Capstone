You need to have Internet Explorer 7.0 and above to use the
Video Player.

be able to use the video player features.

this site.


Netscape 6.2 without Window Media Player plugin installed:
You can install the Windows Media plugin by installing the new Windows
Media Player depending on your operating system. Or we highly recommend
that you upgrade your browser to Netscape 7.1, as it comes with Window
Media plugin and will allow you to view video on this site.

4. What version of Windows Media Player do I
need?
You need to have Windows Media Player 9 or above to use the
Video Player.
This Video Player does not support Windows Media Player 6.4.
Also, QuickTime and Real Player are not supported.
To download the newest Window Media Player, click here.
[Back to top]
5. Does the Video Player support Real video
or Quicktime?
Not at this time. To download the newest Window Media Player, click here.
[Back to top]
6. Do I need cookies enabled to use the
Video Player?
Cookies must be enabled to watch video. If your cookies are
not enabled, the video player will launch but nothing will happen.
[Back to top]
7. Why do I see a streaming video prior to
the video clip I selected?
Sometimes, a streaming media advertisement will play before
the video.
[Back to top]
8. Can I skip this streaming media
advertisement?
No, you cannot skip the streaming advertisement.
[Back to top]
9. The video displays like a slide show. How
can I fix this?
The videos that you are watching are sent, or streamed, to
your computer over the Internet. The speed at which these files can be
streamed varies depending on your computer's "bandwidth". In other
words, if you have a high bandwidth connection (i.e. cable, DSL, T1/LAN
connection), your computer can receive streaming video at a higher
speed than a user with low bandwidth (i.e. modem / ISDN) connection.
This also means that a user with high bandwidth can receive larger,
better quality video stream. On the other hand, a user with a lower
bandwidth may receive the video as a slide show or choppy if they
cannot receive the full video stream.
You can also check your video card settings. Set the number of
colors higher than 256k colors.
Finally, you may be experiencing problems due to bandwidth
congestion. If the problem persists, we also recommend checking back at
a time when your Internet service provider may experience less
congestion to see if there is an improvement.

10. How do I exit Full Screen mode?
Hit the ESC key.
[Back to top]
11. Why is the Video Player page cut off by
my monitor?
The bottom of the Video Player may appear cutoff if your
computer's screen resolution is set to 800x600 pixels or less.
[Back to top]
12. The Video Player displays but nothing
happens?
If you are unable to watch video in the Video Player:



Verify that you meet the system requirements (operating
system, browser and Windows Media Player) as outlined above. 
If you meet the system requirements but still have
difficulty accessing, we recommend you disable any ad or pop up
blocking software tools, including Internet Explorer and Norton
Internet Security 2004 Professional, that you may have installed and
try again. When pop-up window blocking is enabled, the ad blocking
feature automatically blocks the programming code web sites use to open
secondary windows, which include the video player. 
Check that you have cookies enabled. 

[Back to top]
13. I cannot hear the audio. How can I fix
this?
To be able to hear the audio on videos, you must have a
working sound card and your computer speakers turned on with the volume
set at an appropriate level.
If you still receive video without audio: 

Verify that your system audio works by playing another
audio application and/or checking your speaker and headphone wires. 
You may be experiencing an issue downloading the necessary
audio codecs needed to view video. You can remedy the issue by manually
downloading and installing them. For more information and to download
codecs, click here. 

[Back to top]
14. What do I do if I get an error in
regards to codecs?
If a codec error appears when you attempt to watch video, you
may be experiencing an issue downloading the necessary codecs needed to
view video. You can remedy the issue by manually downloading and
installing them. For more information and to download codecs, click here
[Back to top]
15. The audio sounds like chipmunks - too
fast. How can I fix this?
Updating your sound card's driver might take care of this
problem. If you need assistance with getting the latest version of your
sound card driver, contact the card manufacturer.
[Back to top]
16. What speed does the video play at?
The videos that you are watching are sent, or streamed, to
your computer over the Internet. The speed at which these files can be
streamed varies depending on your computer's "bandwidth". In other
words, if you have a high bandwidth connection (i.e. cable, DSL, T1/LAN
connection), your computer can receive streaming video at a higher
speed than a user with low bandwidth (i.e. modem / ISDN) connection.
The video on this site is streamed at 3 different rates to
allow for the best quality for your bandwidth.
[Back to top]
17. The Video Player buffers the video but
the video never loads?
If the video player buffers video but never loads the clip or loads the
clip but the video stutters then your DSL/cable providers using Network
Address Translation (NAT) may not be forwarding UDP packets properly.
The solution is to disable UDP in Media Player. For more information on
disabling the UDP, click here.
To disable the UDP protocol, follow these steps in the Windows
Media Player:
For Windows Media Player version 7.0 and later:

On the Tools menu, click Options. 
Click the Network tab. 
Under Protocols, clear UDP

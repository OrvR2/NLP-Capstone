AUSTIN - The Texas Department of Public Safety is warning residents to be careful while wildfires remain an extreme danger across the state.
DPS officials are urging residents to monitor media and obey evacuation orders when a fire breaks out.
Officials say 80 percent of wildfires occur within two miles of residential neighborhoods and suburbs. When wildfires are moving at extreme speeds, they cannot be controlled. When evacuating, residents are urged to find a route away from the fire hazard and to be alert to changes in the speed and direction of fire and smoke.
When weather conditions make wildfires more likely, you should prepare by taking the following precautions:

Keep firefighting tools handy, such as: ladder long enough to reach the roof, shovel, rake and buckets.
Place connected garden hoses on all sides of the house for emergency use.
Know all emergency exits from your house.
Learn all routes leading out of your neighborhood.

As fires actually approach, you should take the following actions:

Park your car facing the direction of escape.
Shut off gas at the meter. Only a qualified professional can safely turn the gas back on.
Turn off propane tanks.
Place combustible patio furniture inside.
Seal vents with pre-cut plywood or commercial seals.
Wet down or remove shrubs within 15 feet of your residence.
Place lawn sprinklers on roof and near above-ground fuel tanks. Wet down the roof.
Close windows, vents, doors, blinds and non combustible window coverings. Remove flammable drapes and curtains.
Close interior doors and windows to prevent drafts.

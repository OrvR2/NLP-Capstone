Last year, the Giants and Padres kept the National League West suspenseful until game No. 162, and now they're mere footnotes in the division standings. It's more about pride now, being able to finish strong and look themselves in the mirror without taking cover.
Matt Cain and Pablo Sandoval are among the Giants who stand tall. They were All-Stars and produced when those around them so often didn't, and their efforts were obvious once more Tuesday night when they helped keep the Giants in position to beat the Padres 3-2 in 12 innings.
Cody Ross opened the final inning with a single, advanced on Brad Brach's wild pitch and scored on Mark DeRosa's single off second baseman Orlando Hudson's glove. It was DeRosa's first game-ending hit since 2007, and the Giants won a third straight game for the first time since July 17-19 - the first time at home since June 24-26.
"The odds are extremely tough for us right now, but we've still got to play good ball," said Cain, who exited in the seventh inning to a standing ovation and waved his cap to the crowd. "Anything can happen. We've still got to play well and show the fans we appreciate everything they've gone through with the season, and that's a part of being a professional athlete. You have to go out there with pride. You can't go out there and mail it in."
Cain surrendered four hits in 6 1/3 innings and exited after 106 pitches with a 2-0 lead, and it didn't take long for the bullpen to make it 2-2. In a pennant race, Bruce Bochy probably would have let Cain keep pitching, but the manager isn't about to overwork his main guys this late in a seemingly lost season.
So after Cain issued a one-out walk, Javier Lopez and Guillermo Mota were summoned to complete the seventh. But Aaron Cunningham doubled off Lopez, placing two runners in scoring position, and both scored on Jason Bartlett's double off Mota.
The Padres' biggest threat off Cain was a second-and-third, no-out scenario in the fifth, and Cain struck out pitcher Cory Luebke and Will Venable and retired Bartlett on a groundout.
Sandoval collected three more hits, drove in one run and scored one. He's hitting .304 on the season, .419 (13-for-31) in his past eight games. Justin Christian's single in the fourth scored Sandoval. Otherwise, it was a lot of iffy situational hitting and baserunning - pinch-runner Darren Ford was picked off with no outs in the eighth.
The score remained 2-2 until the 12th when DeRosa, who has been hurt most of his two seasons as a Giant, emerged with the game-ending hit. He's 11-for-29 since his latest stint on the disabled list.
"Earlier this year, I might've had visions of grandeur thinking I could do more than I could," DeRosa said. "This second go-round, I realize my limitations. I'm trying to stay short with my stroke and go up the middle, work counts, trying to get on base, and for some reason it's working right now."

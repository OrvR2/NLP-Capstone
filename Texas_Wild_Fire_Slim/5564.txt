WASHINGTON - Whatever path Rick Perry had to a general election victory got narrower with each word the Texas governor spoke Wednesday night about Social Security. Perry declined the opportunity to back down from his book's claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme at the GOP primary debate Wednesday night, going so far as to criticize his former adviser and current agitator Karl Rove for calling his language provocative.
"Karl has been over the top for a long time in some of his remarks. So I am not responsible for Karl anymore," he said.
Earlier, Perry had re-affirmed his belief that Social Security was based on a "monstrous lie" and that absent reforms -- like giving control of the program to the states -- it would not be there for future generations.
"The fact is, we have to be focused on how we are going to change this program," the Texas governor said. "Men and women receiving those benefits today ... don't need to worry about anything. The Republican candidates are talking about ways to transition this program and it is a monstrous lie. It is a Ponzi scheme."
The debate moderators asked Mitt Romney for his response.
"You can't say that to tens of millions of Americans who have lived on Social Security," the former Massachusetts governor said. "Our nominee has to be someone who isn't committed to abolishing Social Security but is committed to saving Social Security."
"Under no circumstances will I ever say ... it is a failure," he added. "It is working for millions of Americans and I will keep it working for millions of Americans."
Perry seemed to struggle a bit with what should be a well-rehearsed topic (it has been the focal point for coverage of his campaign in its early onset). He reminded his opponents that "we are not trying to pick fights here, we are about fixing things" before falling back on his initial talking points.
"You cannot keep the status quo in place and call it anything other than a Ponzi scheme," he said, adding: "Maybe it is time to have some provocative language in this country."
Perry's response was as off politically as it was factually, said economist Dean Baker, of the liberal leaning Center for Economic Policy and Research. "With all due respect to the Governor, this is not true. The recommendations of the National Commission on Social Security Reform in 1983 led to the growth of a large surplus in Social Security. This surplus was used to buy bonds and now Social Security holds more than $2.6 trillion in government bonds," Baker e-mailed HuffPost, noting that the program's actuaries say it will pay full for the next quarter-century-plus. "Even if Congress never makes any changes to the program, Social Security will be able to pay slightly more than 80 percent of scheduled benefits from then on. This means, for example, that if your children -- both in their mid twenties -- were to retire at age 67 and do as well as you have in their working careers, they would receive $38,145 and $39,410 (in 2011 dollars) each, every year, for the rest of their lives. It is clearly inaccurate to say that this program will not exist for young people."
Roger Hickey of the progressive Campaign for America's Future previewed the Democratic strategy now available. "Gov. Perry’s remarks about Social Security show that as President, he would destroy the only retirement system that millions of Americans now depend upon -- and will in the future," he told HuffPost.

				Rove, with Cheney, Bush, Rumsfield and the other collective suspects, should be on trial for multiple crimes against humanity, including citizens of the US.  As for Perry, sadly, his statement about Social Security is a half-truth - it once was an accountabl­e fund which has been massively raped over the years - and now - it is a trust (funny word) that is so depleted by other programs that it must be sustained by many under 50 years of age, who will never see the benefits of their wage deductions­.  So, in a way he is right about Social Security's current state -   but this was not always the case -the Federal Government owes Social Security Trust a huge amount of money - and it needs to be administer­ed by those who can say NO to the government pillagers - sounds like villagers, but it's not.

				This is all a set-up right for Obama to be reelected?  Romney made a lot of sense and, if I were to pick between Perry and Romney, the latter would have several points up on intelligen­ce, science and workable ways to get our economy rolling again.  Romney isn't ready to toss Social Security ad other useful social programs.  However, he knows how to concentrat­e our efforts and money to get the most for the buck.  I think he is sincere about this.

				I SUGGEST TO syllable that he look into Mitten's record at Bain before praising his " sincerity"­.  Corporate raiders are NOT "sincere".  This man fired more people than he ever hired ANYWHERE.  His main focus is the enlargemen­t of one of his mansions which did not have enough space for him.  PLEASE!

				I feel like I am choking to death.  What needs To happen is whether it is a GOP debate or DEM debate, they need to have one regular American as part of the of the Hosting Crew to be able to ask questions.  WHY don't someone ask these GOP CANDIDATES that why When Bush was President for 8 years and the Republican­s had control of the house for 6 years, why didn't they sign legislatur­e to have Heathcare handled by individual states, I believe it was Newt that said the went Hilary in the 90's about Healthcare but no Healthcare bill has ever been written or pass by The Republican­s during their reign during the 8years they had control.  All these things they bitching about, Immigratio­n reform,hea­lthcare, Social Security, Medicare, why didnt they from 2000 to 2006 change all these programs. Because there is a  BLACK Man that is the President of this Country, they don't even respect this BLACK President as President, instead it is OBAMA OR MR.Preside­nt.

				Want to lose most or all of the Social Security benefits that you've paid for most of your working life? Then elect the the corporate front-man, Rick Perry, and a right wing Republican majority in both houses of congress! They will also privatize Medicare and functional­ly destroy Medicaid. Welcome to Rick Perry's world, where you're on your own (http://www­.huffingto­npost.com/­2011/09/06­/health-in­surance-st­ate-best-w­orst_n_950­479.html); say your prayers and good luck!

				It will be interestin­g to see the polls in the next week.  I doubt that Gov. Perry will lose ground based on anything that he has said tonight.  The conservati­ve primary voters seem to take to his style.   Gov. Romney is not likely to attract dissatisfi­ed Perry voters. 
I have a hard time seeing voters shift from Paul, Bachmann, Cain, Santorum or others to Romney.  Those voters will go to Perry, I suspect.

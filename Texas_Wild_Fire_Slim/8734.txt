NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are sharply lower in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 260 points. All 30 stocks that make up the Dow average fell.The losses come after steep declines in European indexes. The Stoxx 600 Europe index fell 4.1 percent on Monday because of concerns that Europe's debt problems could slow growth around the world. The index fell another 1.4 percent Tuesday.The U.S. economy is also weak. A Tuesday report on the U.S. service sector is expected to show the fourth straight month of declining growth.It follows a jobs report Friday that that found that no jobs were added to the economy in August. It was the worst reading on the jobs market since September 2010. The report sent the Dow Jones industrial average down 253 points, or 2.2 percent, and wiped out all of its gains for the week. The Dow is now down nearly 3 percent for the year.Minutes after the opening bell, the Dow was down 264 points, or 2.3 percent, to 10,977. The S&P 500 lost 27, or 2.4 percent, to 1,146. The Nasdaq composite fell 48, or 1.9 percent, to 2,432.Bank of America, Hewlett-Packard Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and General Electric each lost 4 percent or more.The price of assets that appeared to be safer bets during a weak economy rose sharply. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.94 percent, its lowest yield on record since the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis began keeping daily records in 1962. Bond yields fall when prices rise.Gold, another safe asset that has also lately been pushed higher by speculators, jumped 1.6 percent to $1,906 an ounce. And in a sign that investors expect the economy to slow, the price of oil fell sharply. Oil futures dropped nearly 3 percent to just below $84 a barrel.The U.S. markets were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday.

Here's the plan.....

Q4-2011:  QE3 will provide short-term stimulus with no observed improvement in the US GDP or employment.  However the stimulus will provide ample financial gains in non-reoccurring revenues contribution to allow US corporations to rapidly expand foreign operations. DJ will rally to 12300.

Q3-2012:  QE3 stimulus funding is over with no observed improvement to the US GDP.  US government realizes that no other borrowing plan can be executed because of a second round of credit rating lowering.  America braces for a "race" focused election.  DJ falls to 7600 and the country plummets into negative GDP growth, unemployment reaches 17% as reported by the Feds.

Mrs. P...you are correct.  I think this is the new normal for the next 7-10 yrs.  Americans will prevail.  We are resiliant and my hope is that we institute massive government jobs program to re-build America.

I am a white Christian man, Southern born and bred.  Slavery seemed like a logical convenience in the 18th and 19th centuries, and we ignored the human toll.  Now we have to pay for that hideous abomination.  The bill is past due.  We are reaping what we sowed, more than we sowed, and later than we sowed.

Don't worry about the market.....The US will simply borrow another three trillion, spend it on another socialistic bailout program, the market will then rally on the news and then once again when the cash runs out, will roll over....get use to it and don't both calling Uhaul 'cause he ain't mov'in out of the WH........

Come on Obama, balance the budget by reducing the size of government.  Rebuild the military and NASA.  End the wars.  Lower energy cost through domestic production. Rebuild our infrastructure.  Repeal Obamacare and replace with market-based reform. Reform Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid so they will be viable long term. Do these things, and everything else will take care of itself. 

The problem is that after 2 1/2 years it is clear Obama will do none of these things.  Expect the economy to continue to tank.

Hmm ya think maybe the Dow Jones is just reacting to the Tea Party killing the Republican party? As all "GOP" Presidential circus campaigners jump on the tea wagon and abandon the Grand old Party?

Gold up and oil down says way more than the Dow.  It says hide your money (gold up) and gird for the crash (oil down).  It's a potent combination.

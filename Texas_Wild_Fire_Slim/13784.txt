Bastrop, Texas -- 
Residents left homeless by a major central Texas wildfire turned their attention Friday to what they need to move forward, with some voicing frustration over a perceived delay in federal response even as early signs of recovery appeared in reopened neighborhoods.
Firefighters focused on extinguishing hot spots and had isolated remaining flames from the blaze that has burned for almost a week in and around the city of Bastrop, incinerating nearly 1,400 homes and sweeping across about 45 square miles of rain-starved landscape.
"We believe the forward progress (of the fire) has been stopped," Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst told evacuated residents gathered at the fire command center.
Still, thousands of evacuees were prevented from returning to their homes for a sixth day because trees continued to burn underground, loose power lines hung from scorched poles and more than 800 firefighters were working to tamp down the remainder of the fire 25 miles east of Austin.
"It's just really frustrating," said Dee Redenius, 40, who came to the fire command center for answers. "You want to know if your house is there or if it's not. ... They don't let you in."
Texas is in the midst of its worst wildfire outbreak in state history. A perilous mix of hot temperatures, strong winds and a historic drought spawned the Bastrop-area fire, the largest of the nearly 190 wildfires the state forest service says erupted this week, killing four people, destroying more than 1,700 homes and forcing thousands to evacuate.
Washington fire Residents in tinder-dry forests near Washington state's Satus Pass learned Friday that 64 structures had burned in a major ongoing blaze.Hundreds of residents in the south-central part of the state have been evacuated because of the fire, which has burned more than 6 square miles in an area about 10 miles north of the city of Goldendale.Exactly how many of the 64 structures were homes remained unclear.Source: Associated Press

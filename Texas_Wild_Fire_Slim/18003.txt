Senate Republicans have introduced legislation that would eliminate the cap on the number of charter schools in Michigan.
 
State Sen. Phil Pavlov (R-St. Clair), chair of the Senate Education Committee, describes the move as part of an overhaul of the state’s education system.
In a statement today he said:
In addition to removing the arbitrary cap on university-authorized charter schools, reforms in the legislative package would:
Expand opportunities for cyber charter schools in Michigan;
Allow a majority of parents or teachers at a school to petition their district to convert the school to a charter;
Expand dual enrollment opportunities for high-achieving students and the ability of districts to provide services to part-time, non-public students; and
Meet the specific request laid out by Gov. Rick Snyder in his special message to the Legislature on education to require all districts in the state to participate in the current schools of choice program.
Last week Pavlov told the Michigan Association of Secondary School Principals that the education reform package will include a measure that would allow school districts to hire teachers through a private company.
The package has not yet been published and staff in Pavlov’s office were not immediately available to discuss the bills.

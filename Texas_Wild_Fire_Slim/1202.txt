UPDATE: The USC football team has been stripped of its 2004 national championship victory and must vacate its entire 2005 season, according to ESPN's Bruce Feldman.
Describing the NCAA sanctions, a school official said "we got killed" earlier in the day.

EARLIER:
USC's football program has been banned from postseason play for two years and will lose more than 20 scholarships, the Los Angeles Times reports. ESPN's Bruce Feldman first tweeted about the sanctions Wednesday night.
School sources were "surprised at the severity and length of penalties," according to Bryan Fischer of USCFootball.com and Rivals. He also wrote that USC has 15 days to decide whether to appeal the sanctions.
It was reported Tuesday that the school could expect sanctions this week, and an article at USCFootball.com on Wednesday claimed that the university had received its NCAA infractions report.
 In January, the University of Southern California imposed sanctions on its basketball team after its investigation concluded that the school violated NCAA rules while recruiting former Trojan and current Memphis Grizzly OJ Mayo.
On Thursday, HuffPost's Adam Rose appeared on ESPN's "Outside the Lines" to discuss the sanctions:

				Why are minor league football players not paid anyway? Why does the NFL get to use my University dollar to help fund its minor league system? Why has anyone ever had college paid for them, while others more qualified didn't, simply because they played a game well? 

It's time the NFL stopped benefiting from socializin­g the cost of running a minor league system. It's time people went to school to learn.

				The NCAA’s action against the USC Trojans sends a message to all major college athletic programs to check your egos at the door, be proactive about monitoring your student-at­hletes and follow the rules. The bottom line — if you don’t comply, you’ll lose millions of dollars.

				Click the link in the article for the PDF. Here are some salient details from it:

==========­==========­==========­======
The NCAA Division I Committee on Infraction­s has penalized the University of Southern California for violations in its football, men's basketball and women's tennis programs.

The violations span almost four years, primarily involving agent and amateurism issues for a former football student-at­hlete and a former men's basketball student-at­hlete. The committee noted that the violations in this case strike at the heart of the NCAA amateurism principal, which states that intercolle­giate athletics should be motivated primarily by education and its benefits.

Regarding the individual­s who triggered NCAA agent rules and the former student-at­hletes in this case, the committee stated, "Their actions also threatened the efforts of the NCAA and its member institutio­ns to sponsor and support amateur competitio­n at the collegiate level."

The findings in this case include a lack of institutio­nal control, impermissi­ble inducement­s, extra benefits, exceeding coach staff limits, and unethical conduct by an assistant football coach.

				I agree. This is really poor reporting. You don't put the underlying reason for an article in a footnote or a click-away­; you must at least summarize it. And the question of who they beat in 2004 and whether or not they will be awarded the trophy retroactiv­ely is surely on most reader's minds: why not answer it?

				USC is now stewing in its own hubristic juice. They could have stopped all that nonsense had they intervened when they should have. And now they are suffering the consequenc­es of its absence of oversight and internal controls.

It doesn't take anecdotal hearsay accounts from disaffecti­onate former students to tell you how epidemic and endemic the corruption on the USC campus truly is, and how administra­tors turn a blind eye to all that is around them because they fear for their lucrative positions. 

If their response to their woodsheddi­ng and public fanny-whac­king by the NCAA is of any indication­, they haven't gotten it, and they still don't get it.

And those who place institutio­nal power, prerogativ­es, and its perceived reputation over ethics and the well-being of their students never have and never will.

				Is it possible that you American's misunderst­ood and accepted what it means to be either criminal or illegal in this instance? Have you all accepted the ultimate authority of the NCAA without first thinking for yourselves­? Who's making money? Are they righteous? Is there really amateur athletic purity in college sports? IMO the NCAA are a very large bunch of crooks, and having been an NCAA athlete in the past I know that my opinion is quite valid... Don't go asleep, America! These people are not as good or as pure as they claim to be. Nor are their victims(Re­ggie Bush et al.) anywhere near as criminal as they or the media would have you believe... and as or USC?!.... Really? This is such a sad rip off..... lets all take a deep breath adn grow the fook up!!

More than 100 digital Kroger coupons available
By Kim Margolis

 | 	Tuesday, August  3, 2010, 10:45 AM

Shoppers can now search for up to 150 digital coupons for cost-savings at area Kroger stores.
There are coupons for national manufacturer brands and Kroger store brands.
Customers can search the deals at Kroger.com/DigitalCoupons. Then they select the discounts they are interested in and click the “Load Coupons to Card” option to load them onto their Kroger Plus Card. The savings will be reflected at the register once the Kroger card is swiped.
To sign up for the coupons you do have to have a plus card and have the plus card number available when signing in.
Coupons will be available one hour after they are loaded onto a customer’s card. Each digital coupon loaded to the site is subject to an expiration date, generally within six weeks of being loaded to the digital coupon center.

Hi Jill.  I wanted to see how we can get listed on your cool-saving tips sidebar.  We are a local group of volunteers focused on stocking food pantries with coupons.  Our new blog is up and we are posting coupon match-ups, rebates, freebies and MORE.  But the best part is that we are doing the deals right here in Dayton.  Please let me know if you can help…and if you woudl ever like to link up to our site or interview us for the paper…we woudl LOVE it!  We have donated thousands of dollars of food and toiletries this year to the food pantries for FREE!

opps!

Meijers has the Cubs with the Certified Angus Beef program that is very good, Cubs has choice and their own Angus program which is also very good. I think of Cubs and Meijiers as being roughly equal to each other and Kroger not really, if you know what I mean. (Sorry Kroger, I know it hurts).

I made a goof (sorry about that).

Does Kroger’s have this better grade of beef? Yes, but but they push the select cuts and nicer cuts seem to be sold at a nicer and higher price (ouch!)
Sorry for the typo. Okay now go to Wal-Mart and toss some of those day old tomatoes at me. They are on sale you know.

A huge disappointment those coupons are! They’re mostly for new products Kroger wants to sell, only 2 were items I usually purchase. Also, some require you buy 2 or more items, not practical for a small household. Kroger, please give me coupons that save me money instead of promoting new products to raise your profits!

If you look at the coupon page before you sign in,you will see real good deals,like a $3 coupon for Tide,also acouple dollar coupon for Charmin,so you sign inGuess what!! You are going to see all those good coupons have dissappeared.I Wrote Kroger about it,but they continue doing this.I have noticed it for several months now.I now go to Meijers.

I agree with emptynester - no coupons for the items I purchase. Although I still think Kroger has better prices than Meijer.  If you’re looking for the best meat then shop at Dorothy Lane Market. I go there for all our meat and produce. Kroger gets my other grocery needs. I wish DLM had coupons and a location in Beavercreek!!

It;s good to have coupons but it’s also good to have friendly people working there.  The employees who work behing the customer service desk at the Centerville Kroger don’t know how to smile!

I’d rather shop someplace like Aldi’s that eschews coupons and just has ultra-low prices.  You may have “saved” $50 on a bill with all the coupons but to me that equates to all the savings you get at Kohls when they have their biggest sale of the season…every weekend.  The supermarkets jack the prices up to offset coupons and “sales”.

OH pam. Yo are so yesterday. I bet you shop Walmart and they are an import export outlet for China along with the rest of the retailers. When at Kroger did you check to see where your fish were caught and processed? Guess where? Go ahead and guess, from your pocket to fund their middle class and military machines. The Chinese could not do it without you.
Face it we are all scr*wed. 
But Aldi does charge a lot less and they pay their workers well.

Stop picking on me! I don’t buy food at Walmart but non food items I do buy. That way I can act superior to other people. Hey did you hear? China is having a ten percent off sale today and I am on my way to the Sugarcreek Walmart to save, save, save. 
I love China and everything they do to enhance my shopping experience. Then it is off to the spa :-) tis the life of luxury.

I just signed up for these coupons and the tide and charmin and other name brand name coupons were right there.  I dont shop at aldi because their food is cheap and I dont mean that in a good way.  You get what you pay for and aldi just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Jan,

You are correct!
“The employees who work behind the customer service desk at the Centerville Kroger dont know how to smile” and act like they could care less about your business. I know several customers that have had similar experiences at that store.

I personally have nothing against any store.  However, there are certain things that I can buy from Aldi rather than from kroger because of the price. The meat is fine in my book!  Even Aldi raises prices! In all honesty you don’t know what any company does with mean now a days. All you can do is pray over your food and trust in God!

There are some things that I buy from Aldis( They are German owned) I don’t find the quality to be different than Kroger brands. Name brand companies produce for store brands, they just put a store brand label on to the product-it sells a little bit cheaper..

First - Kroger and Meijer are not run by the same people.  Second - the digital coupons didn’t change when you signed in - they just resorted.  If you haven’t already used them - they’re there some place. Also, if you think Aldi and Walmart aren’t jacking up prices, your wrong.  The coupons are all pulled from lost of different places - cellfire, valasis (newspaper inserts), coupons.com, etc. into one spot.  They are mostly manufacturer coupons - from the look of it…and are decided by the manufacturer - not Kroger.  Silly people - you really are cynical…you believe everyone is out to get you…don’t look outside, someone’s digging through your trash right now to steal your personal information! LMAO.

As for the items…you’re right - no one wants $3 off of Tide or Bounty…those don’t seem useful at all…

For all you people that are intelligent, I’ve noticed the coupons often pair up with those selling events they are having…like 10/$10 and buy 10 save $5 events.  That makes for real savings.  It’s not all the items, and yes there may be new items - but that’s what manufacturers put coupons out for in the first place.  Exposure - trial - and hopefully consumer demand.  Funny how that works.

Most Products come from the same distribution centers to our area grocery stores. Did you know Kraft Macaroni is made at Kroger’s State Street facility (Cinti). Different ingredients than Krogers Mac’n’chez. Your new car purchase(foreign)has the majority of your monies going overseas moreso than your food purchases. So if you’re a Honda/Toyota/Scion/
Volvo/SAAB/Mercedes/
BMW/Hyundai/KIA lover…start shopping at Walmart  for the savings. Yes, foreign car factories are here…and a little goes to the American worker, and the majority goes to the foreign country.

Some of you people are so freaking stupid and uninformed. #1 All generic food including Aldi is made on the same damn production line as name brand. Example…Green Giant makes all kroger brand canned veggies. As you will see at kroger, there is tons of facings of there brand and no green giant…hmmm wonder why that is?

Kroger offers senior age 60+ a 10% discount.  However the Cincinnati district of Kroger will not offer this discount.  Seniors in Cincinnati, Dayton, etc need to call Kroger and voice their dissatisfaction and also their local store management.  I now shop elsewhere!

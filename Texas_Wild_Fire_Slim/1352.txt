By Josef Kuhn
c. 2011 Religion News Service 
WASHINGTON (RNS) The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday (Sept. 6) announced a settlement with Henrico County, Va., over the county's alleged violation of a federal anti-discrimination law when it refused to rezone property for a group of Muslims who wanted to build a mosque.

The Justice Department claimed the county's actions violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), which prohibits religious discrimination in land use and zoning decisions. The settlement requires the county to allow the mosque to be built without improper interference or delay.

"Religious freedom is one of our most cherished rights, and that right includes the ability to assemble and build places of worship without facing discrimination," said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez.

The case arose in late 2008 when local Muslims were denied the ability to build the first mosque in the county, just north of Richmond. The Muslims filed suit, charging that the denial of the request was "arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable."

The Justice Department joined the case in March 2010 and found evidence that the request to build had been denied on the basis of hostility toward Muslims. The county had never turned down a rezoning application submitted by one of its 209 Christian churches, government attorneys said.

The settlement requires Henrico County to publicize its nondiscrimination policies and to provide training on RLUIPA to all county officials involved in land use matters.

"This agreement will ensure that religious freedom is upheld in Henrico County," said Neil H. MacBride, the U.S. attorney for the
Eastern District of Virginia.

				I particular­ly like this part:
"Religious freedom is one of our most cherished rights, and that right includes the ability to assemble and build places of worship without facing discrimina­tion," said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas Perez.

Too many people claim that this is the land of the free, without thinking that concept out.
You don't have to agree with your fellow  Americans, but it's a basic tenet of our culture to accept that everyone has equal freedom of religion.
That's not always easy, but it's right.

				Quick, bury a pig right in the center of the property, where they'll be sure to find it when they start to build.

Then, somebody build a gay bar on one side of the proposed site and a whorehouse on the other side.

				There's no place for mosques in this country. All they are is gathering places for terrorists­. If you need to go to a mosque, take some oil money, fly home, do your praying then stay there. Oh, and take obama with you. To build a mosque in Virginia is suicide. Southeners don't take kindly to people that aren't American.

				The "Religious Land Use and Institutio­nalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA"?  What the hell is that?  More government getting in our lives.  I say the hell with the Muslims.  If people don't want their mosques in their communitie­s, then they should not have to have them.  Is is just wrong.

				I wholeheart­edly agree with the DOJ's decision regarding the building of the mosque. If we expect that there not be any discrimina­tion regarding any religion's decision to build anywhere they may choose to, assuming that they can obtain the property and that they abide by the assorted building codes, then we must offer the same protection to Islam or any other non-judeoc­hristian religion.

Personally­, I am not at all sure of the wisdom of building any new mosques right now. Certainly not given the current climate of xenophobia sweeping the nation. But that's their problem.

				A place of worship is one thing.   But a building that is establishe­d to remind the congregati­on they are NOT american can do more than just provide a place to worship.  It can boarder brainwashi­ng those who attend to feel less American.  And thousands of Muslims in every city feeling less and less American can ultimately bring disaster.  When you see the Mosques demanding to take over American residentia­l neighborho­ods under new zoning it becomes a grave reminder that there's a group that's more concerned with their agenda than just worshiping thier god IN America without disrupting Americans.

				One of our fundamenta­l rights as an American is Freedom of Religion. This is not some 3rd world country under a dictatorsh­ip. Good Grief.. some of you people have Islamophob­ia which describes prejudice against, hatred or irrational fear of Islam or Muslims . Wonder how many have JapanesePh­obia or Viet Nam Phobia..I think we need to "get over it" their are radicals in most every religion and politica party so, we need to be more tolorable to the good ones.

				Sure, try an build a Christian church in Iraq or any of the Muslim country's and see what happens.  Those are the beliefs and principles they are bringing into our country and using our Constituti­on to do it.  When their numbers become overwhelmi­ng to our country as others like England, France, Germany;  then you'll see what their religious freedom is all about.  Of course if your not a religious person, it won't matter then.

				You are wrong.  In the past 2 1/2 years we have become a third world country.

There is no irrational fear of muslims.  Did they not attack us while the rest of the muslim world cheered them on?  How many of their leaders have been preaching against the U.S. in these quasi-reli­gious building that they have built up around the country?  Have you heard them preach against the United States and Christiani­ty?  

They want you dead Skydave, unless you are one of them.

You cannot separate the radicals from the peace loving muslims, because you have never met a peace loving muslim.

Let them all go back to cooking with camel dung, back where they belong.  If it was so great, why are they here?

				Those words are spelled phonetical­ly in their native tongues. I've seen numerous spellings for AQ, just like I've seen news papers print Kaddafi, Gaddafi, & Qaddafi, all being the same person- The former dictator of Libya. As to the Taliban, You've never had a typo?

				The Constituti­on has lost its intended purpose.  It is now being used as a "club" by extemist groups.  This decision  provides for "home bases" for subversive intent throughout the country.  The "evil doers" will hide in their  "sanctuari­es" to plot the overthrow of the USA.   Don't believe it ??  They've said it was their intent.  Even those within their ranks who question the intent fear the evil doers.  Is there a "constitut­ion" in their homelands that would allow the building of churches on their soil wherever the builders choose  ---  without intimidati­on?

				Where'd you get all that?

Wow.

Not true at all.

Learn about Islam from a mainstream source.

Anti-Islam sources lead to comments like your comment above.

Japanese driver Hideki Mutoh will return for next week's Indy Japan Final on the Motegi road course, not the oval damaged in the massive March earthquake, according to the race series.
Mutoh, a Tokyo native with 52 IndyCar starts who won the series Rookie of the Year award in 2008, will drive for Schmidt Motorsports alongside Canada's Alex Tagliani. His best career showing was second at Iowa in 2008.
The Japan race will be the first staged by IndyCar on the Twin Ring Motegi road course, after damage to the oval in a massive earthquake earlier this year.
"It means a lot to me to be able to race in front of my home crowd again," Mutoh said. "This has been a tough year for Japan and I hope we can bring some excitement to the many fans. I'm determined to do well."
England's Martin Plowman drove the car in the past two Indycar races.
While the series will not race after this year in Japan, it will add a race next year at the two-mile Auto Club Speedway oval in Fontana, California. It will be a night race on September 15, 2012.

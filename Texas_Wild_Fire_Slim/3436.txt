Pro- and anti-Paul Ryan demonstrators gathered outside Klemmer's Banquet Hall on Tuesday afternoon as the U.S. Congressman from Janesville spoke as a guest of the Whitnall Park Rotary Club.
Inside, many protesters disrupted Ryan's talk. As many as a dozen were escorted out of the building by the Greenfield Police Department. Another dozen anti-Ryan demonstrators left the speech willingly.
Ryan faced a similarly hostile crowd when he spoke at Whitnall High School in late April.

Wow. Get a load of that chick at about 1:40 who asked him how he was going "to put food on her table & support her family". That is not, has never, and God willing WILL never be the job of the government.

Paul Ryan is one of the few politicians who actually talks to us as an adult. He "gets it". The folks protesting him? Not so much.

Hey Jeff Klass
1) If you want to see what a country looks like whose country does NOT provide food, shelter and health for their poor - go check out Yemen.  Is that what you want the USA to look like.
2) You left out the rest of what that woman said.  She said unemployment rate is 9.1% and what are you (Ryan) doing to create jobs - so, since Ryan refuses to help create jobs what is HE (Ryan) going to do to make sure SHE puts food on her table.
Ryan is owned by Corporate THUGS - Ryan used his father's social security MONEY to pay for his college -- he's a fraud.

One more thing. The people who asked Ryan questions are HIS CONSTITUENTS and they have a legitimate complaint, unemployment.
The GOP campaigned on and promised that they (GOP) would create jobs if we elect them in 2010
The US Economy was recovering UNTIL the GOP took over the House and now unemployment is not going down -- Ryan's Constituents have a FIRST AMENDMENT right to ask him questions. 
A decent Representative would have answered their questions - but NOT Ryan, he has NO CLASS as all Ryan did was belittle his own constituents.  
I guess the Unemployment rate is NOT of concern to Ryan

This was set up as a speech to the Rotary Club. Those protesters, who may or may not be his constuency, were disruptive, rude & disrespectful to te host of the event. That is low class, as is most of what comes from the left.
Funny - looking at the founding documents hanging on the wall in my office, I see "Life, Liberty & the Pursuit of Happiness", not "food on my plate, healthcare & a J-O-B. But then the leftys never did like the constitution, did they. It's not Ryan's job, Obama's job or any other politicians job to create jobs. Their collective job is to MINIMIZE the influence and effect they have on on people's lives - not maximize it. The left just doesn't get that this country was founded on samll government, Large indivdual liberty. Yes, that means the opportunity tro succeed beyond your neighbor (a good thing) anfd it means the opportunity to FAIL.

















Jeff Klass

1:28pm on Wednesday, September 7, 2011

How can you blame this on the house? that is 1/3rd of the D.C. government. The economy was not, has not & will not recover under the plans fomented by this administration. That's not Ryan & Cantor's fault - that is squarely where the buck (used to) stop - the PRESIDENT. Remember when we had presidents who took responsibility, good or bad, for their actions & the country? Not this twit - it's never HIS fault - it's the tsunami, or the Taxed Enough Already Party, or the Arab Spring, etc. What a joke.

Remember those townhall meetings disrupted by nascent teapartiers two years ago?  Ryan celebrated their activism and civic involvement back then, but now that he's on the receiving end of that discontent, not so much.

Jesus Christ on crutches! This was NOT a town hall meeting. Rep. Ryan was the invited guest of the Rotary club. Are you stoned, stupid or just too partisan to recognize that? These people were rude, disruptive and deserved to be arrested.

Jeff, the people in the Rotary Club were paying customers. Paying customers who didn't agree with Paul Ryan and his ilk were apparently not welcome. A friend attended Paul Ryan's Town Hall meeting in Racine this spring, and was the first up for Q&A. Paul didn't answer the question, just spewed talking points. When challenged on a talking point with a fact, Paul dodged and weaved like a prizefighter. Protesting is a Constitutionally-protected right, whether you are a bused-in Republican campaign worker chasing a Florida election worker through the hallways during the 2000 presidential election, disrupting a soldier's funeral with religious extremist propaganda, hectoring the president of the United States on the House floor during a nationally-televised speech, or even racists "taking back the Wisconsin State Fair" in front of West Allis City Hall. A U.S. citizen may have personal opinions on the views expressed by these protestors, whether they agree or think they should be arrested. But reasonable people understand that the law gives us all the right to speak our minds. 
So when you became abusive in your response to thompsonville's comment ("are you stoned, stupid..."), the Constitution gives you the right to express your opinion, even when you clearly missed the poster's point about the selective convenience of activism.

















Jeff Klass

7:25pm on Wednesday, September 7, 2011

The folks that paid specifically to stand up & protest were there under false pretenses. I didn't miss the posters point, I question the choice. Say what you want, under constitutional protections, as I do when I get "abusive" (you're joking, right?) - but do it in an adult, respectful, aware of the setting manner. These lefty slime didn't do that, it wasn't the place. Good thing the Rotarians got their 15 bucks out of these scumbags though. That's the only good thing.
Really? A politician bobbing & weaving? Wow. never saw that happen before. please provide the facts offered to rep. Ryan & the context of the question he dodged. Otherwise, it's just you spouting off against someone you don't like, Bren.

It is NOT the government's role to create jobs.  It is the government's role to allow jobs to be created by those who create jobs that are beneficial to a corporation.  Government simply needs to GET OUT OF THE WAY so that corporations can adequately perform their role of job creation.

Bren

Joe, you're right that the government's primary job is not to create jobs and ideally should support job creators. But we saw proof positive during the GWBush administration that the Bush tax cuts, established to help the "job creators," resulted in higher wages for the "job creators." The tax cuts also funded the "job creators" in sending existing U.S. jobs to the Third World. Ideally, the corporations would have taken advantage of those tax cuts to build new factories, conduct research, grow their businesses here and hire more Americans. Since that obviously didn't happen, what's the next step?
















Jeff Klass

7:21pm on Wednesday, September 7, 2011

You are leaving out half the equation. What happened to the 10% bracket under the Bush tax rates? These tax cuts were across the board, all the way to ELIMINATING the bottom 10% bracket, the single largest tax cut for LOWER INCOME people in history. Nice glossing over of the facts.

Bren: I hope your kind keeps up this behavior it really makes you guys look great! Wait let me guess your response. Evil corporations, greedy banks, GW Bush's fault, give me a break, your side and ilk are all the same ,you are like parasites sucking the life force out of this country. You blame everyone else but yourselves for your problems and when that fails you blame some evil corporation. why don't you just save us all some time and make one general response for this and all future blogs. I'll write it for you. It goes like this. Blah, Blah, Blah its Bush's fault, I hate banks and capitalism too. Please come join me in the fight for the little man. Oh yeah I almost forgot lets tax the rich a ton they suck worse than the oil companies, blah , blah blah. There just copy and paste that and you should be all set for any future discussions.

JOHNSTOWN, Pa. -- A new video shows a cloud of gray smoke rising in the sky minutes after United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in western Pennsylvania on Sept. 11, 2001.
Berkebile calmly reports a plane has crashed a few miles from his Berlin home and assumes a link to the other terror attacks that day.
Donna Glessner is collecting oral histories for the National Park Service. She believes the video is the earliest footage of the crash in Shanksville, a rural area southeast of Pittsburgh.
Flight 93 crashed as passengers fought four hijackers. Investigators believe the plane was going 580 mph upon impact.
Forty passengers and crew members perished.

																The 10th anniversary of 9/11 provides us with a "teachable moment" to determine just what kind of nation we want to be: one dedicated to peace and non-violence, or one trapped in the pursuit of violence as a hallmark of our foreign policy?

				the 9/11 arguments remind me of the national convention­­s. Watching the Republican convention­­, replete with the good looking, wholesome and prosperous I think "I want to be like these people!". Watching the Democratic convention and its endless paean to the down-trodd­­en and marginaliz­­ed I think "this rag-tag assembly of the blind, crippled and insane can't find their rumps with both hands, let alone run a country!".­­..and yet, and yet...

I sincerely want to be like those who accept the official conspiracy theory. Yet the much ballyhooed NIST reports had to falsify the input data to make the models behave as they wanted:

http://dig­­within.ne­t­/2011/08­/1­6/why-t­he-­nist-r­epor­t-on-­the-w­tc-t­owers-­is-­false/

At the very least, NIST is guilty of bad scientific method. Think about the extraordin­­ary parameters of the NIST report, which run from the impact of the planes to the point of "collapse initiation­­", as if the unpreceden­ted collapses are thereby explained! The Bush administra­­tion seemed determined to let nothing interfere with the official story.  Other than the video above and the handful of photos that were on-line shortly after 9/11, in the last 10 years have we been given any supporting forensic evidence? The Official Story stinks; it reeks to high heaven, and NO ad hominem attacks on "truthers" can change that. Disparagin­­g the 9/11 truth movement does nothing to change the lack of evidence. This deliberate obfuscatio­­n is The Problem.

				The "80-some security cameras is a known falsehood. You really need to get the facts before spouting off.

The 84/ 85 figure for videos came about as the result of a FOIA request for videos showing the Pentagon impact. FBI Special Agent Jacqueline Maguire responded with the following point:

"...I subsequent­ly searched a series of FBI evidence databases, including the FBI's Electronic Case File system and the FBI's Investigat­ive Case Management System, and determined that the FBI possessed eighty-fiv­e (85) videotapes that might be potentiall­y responsive to plaintiff'­s FOIA request. This determinat­ion was based on videotapes that had been submitted into FBI evidence, sent directly to the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, and/or obtained by the FBI's Washington Field Office."

56  of these videotapes "did not show either the Pentagon building, the Pentagon crash site, or the impact of Flight 77 into the Pentagon on September 11."

Of the remaining 29 videotapes­, 16 "did not show the Pentagon crash site and did not show the impact of Flight 77 into the Pentagon."

Of the 13 remaining tapes, 12 "only showed the Pentagon after the impact of Flight 77."

Only one tape showed the Pentagon impact: the Pentagon's own security camera footage, that would later be released.

				So what you are saying is that the Pentagon is quite literally one of the least secure buildings in America? One camera pointed toward this huge facade? 

Actually what you have described is a smoke screen concocted by the FBI, ... 84 red herrings and 1 actual surveillan­ce camera recording of the area of impact. 

If this is true, which I doubt, DOD has a great deal of explaining still to do about why they allow thatcritic­al facility to remain unmonitore­d in the way you describe.

				Zapruder 2. As for the massive "black cloud of smoke" it isn't very black at all for a fuel fired blaze, ... and the two smaller "clouds" are roughly the same color, but based upon the drift of the plume of smoke from the ground, ... are either small clouds, or smoke from other sources. Aircraft firing at the jet perhaps? 

The cloud from the ground is white where the sun shines on it from above, ... typical of the smoke from fires that have been doused with water, ... and yet that is the Highest, earliest part of the plume. Strange. 

As for the videograph­er, ... what took him 10 years? Just put it away in his sock drawer as though it were the sort of thing you see every day? Really?

				Why? In short because the Pentagon does not jut a quarter mile into the sky. The low level approach of a jet that large would be difficult to nearly impossible for a good pilot let alone the knucklehea­ds we saw on the 5 o'clock news that day. 

The informatio­n about 9/11 has been available to Americans for years, and the nature of Americans is to deny, deny, deny. We want to believe it was a conspiracy­, ... but of Saudis with boxcutters and not of members of our government­. What would the administra­tion gain by telling Americans once again what they have been denying for a decade?

				I am tired of the misleading headlines at HP. As to the story, I worked for Pan American World Airways when jets were bombed-des­troyed on the ground in Cairo, crashed in Bali and American Somoa.  There was always something left even if it was only the metal frame of the fuselage.  The Pentagon incident is remarkable to me because of the shape of the crash site and the lack of debris and the same can be said of the PA site.  ALL I ever saw was a smoking hole in the ground. Even if the airspeed was 580 and they crashed nose down, which they did not, there would be something left. As to the comments about bodies, I want to know if any family had a recognizab­le body returned for burial.  I apologize for being insensitiv­e but even the most horrific accidents often leave identifiab­le bodies or body parts. And as for black boxes, they are designed to withstand everything­. We just saw one retrieved from the deepest parts of the Atlantic ocean after months and the tape was usable.  Those boxes in the 2 towers were found and I want to know what was on them.  If it is as we are told, there is nothing to hide or protect.

				So I guess you think the photos of landing great, windows and other pieces of wreckage found at the Pentagon are somehow fakes. Not only that, but explain how the death and entire life story of the 30 people killed there was faked also. I dare you to come up with a logical answer to either of those things. Good luck.

				I can support you 100% on this. I was a pilot for a FAA contract accident investigat­or many, many years ago. We did not investigat­e military accidents but he was called in on a lot of civilian ones, quite a few involving crop dusters, and I know that what the families buried in many cases was about 170 pounds of sandbags and little else.

It may hard to find much of the airplane, either, if there is an intense fire. An inexperien­ced eye would find hardly anything that it could identify as an airplane part. Mostly, all there is is some burned dirt.

				The attack on the Pentagon..­.

"As a hijacked plane barreled towards Washington DC, a young man would come in and say to Vice President Cheney, 'The plane is﻿ 50 miles out...the plane is 30 miles out.  And when it got down to...the plane is 10 miles out, the young man also said to the vice president, 'do the orders still stand? The Vice president turned and whipped his neck around and said, 'Of course the orders still stand..."

(Pentagon and White House are 'Class Bravo' airspace, which is AUTOMATIC SHOOT DOWN of all unauthoriz­­­­ed aircraft. They saw it coming, yet the plane penetrated the most heavily defended perimeter without any challenge)

Who was this young man?

What was the order?

Why did this testimony not make into the 9/11 Report?

Why was Pentagon not evacuated, since the trajectory of the plane was obvious?”

				There is no such thing as an "Automatic Shoot Down"  any aircraft that flies over restricted airspace will initially be escorted out of the area and forced to land.  Ignorant/l­ost pilots have accidental­ly flown over the White House, the Capitol, the Pentagon, etc. before.

And I find it impossible to believe that Cheney was using a "young man" to communicat­e orders in a national crisis.  Do you really think a 4 star general takes "stand-dow­n" or "shoot down"  orders from a "young man"- that's just plain ridiculous

				The flight crashed into the Pentagon nearly an hour after the first plane flew into the WTC tower.

8:46 and 9:03 were the times of the WTC crashes. 9:37 was the time of the Pentagon crash.

So am I supposed to be amazed and "conspirac­y-driven" that the VP was monitoring another hijacked flight as it approached Washington­? That there was a shoot-down order that just couldn't come to fruition?

REALLY? What "heavily defended perimeter" are you talking about? Are there rocket-lau­nchers on the roof?

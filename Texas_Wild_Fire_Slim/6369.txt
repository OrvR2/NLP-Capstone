When Utah mom Shelli Eldredge traveled to Hawaii early this summer to vacation with her husband and two sons, she ended up in the hospital, in a coma, with a broken spine, shattered pelvis and fractured facial bones and skull. 
During a family moped ride on their trip, she crashed into a pole, leaving her with life-threatening injuries, TODAY reported. 
"I came back and I saw her lying on the ground, and it was just devastating," Eldredge's son, Alex, told ABC affiliate KITV in Honolulu. 
The next day she slipped into a coma, and her husband, Dr. Steve Eldredge, himself a physician, was faced with the decision of whether or not to take her off life support, according to TODAY. 
"It became pretty apparent that she wasn't going to wake up," Steve Eldredge told TODAY. 
But he chose not to take her off life support -- and days later, she was showing signs of movement, even laughing at a joke Steve told while in her room. 
There's "not a lot of medical justification -- the brain injury and the testing demonstrated loss of typical brain architecture was not consistent or compatible with life or return of function," Steve Eldredge said on TODAY.
Now, Eldredge attends physical therapy three times a week to regain her movement, and she needs a wheelchair to get around. But she is able to talk and interact with her family again, and was well enough to travel to share her story on the TODAY show. She said she doesn't remember anything about the actual crash, and her doctors and family say it's a miracle she survived.
"My doctors were so great, they were so good. But I mean, everyone, even the doctors said, 'She doesn't have a chance of coming back,'" Eldredge said. "I just think we're so blessed, hopefully I find my mission and can help other people." 
Eldredge's story was originally reported by The Salt Lake Tribune. You can read the full story here.

				Had a friend - wearing a helmet, the good heavy thck kind, driver ran him into a pole - the helmet didn't help him - when his head hit the pole the helmet cracked - the impact was so hard even the doctor said that the only thing the helmet did was to keep my friends skull in the helmet. I would always wear a helmet on a motor cycle, but I will not wear one while riding my horses.

				About wearing helmets...­........
What makes me cringe is when I am going 65 on the highway and a morotcycle with two people on it comes flying by and the riders not only are not wearing helmets, but they are in sleevless t's and shorts and flip flops.  I know how back a motorcycle accident can be for heads, but I cringe  at the thought of what kind of road rash would happen if they crashed. I know it's no fun wearing chaps and helmets when the weather's nice, but it is a good idea. You may be the BEST motorcycle driver out there, but cars are notorious for having drivers that don't even see you let alone give you room for error.

				Maybe they ought to reasses their method of evaluation and prognosis of that type of injury...I­n any event it wonderful she is better!!!

I was recently diagnosed with blockage in my artaries from my local hospital..­..I was told emergency surgery was needed  and veins in my leg were needed to replace blockage..­After daysa of fretting I went to the surgens office for more scheduled eveluation­....luckly the surgen and tech running test were puzzled...­they couldnt find any blockage whatsoever­....they sent me home God works in mysterious ways..

				I saw the interview on the Today show this morning and it made me feel uneasy. The family was very sly in their presentati­on of the facts, stating that the crash occurred but visibly and tellingly avoiding how or what condition she was in when it occurred. A one point the doctor husband hurriedly threw in a statement that he thought the wife "had been hit first" which softball Matt Lower slip by without follow up. At another point the wife murmured something about god keeping her alive for some higher purpose but when asked what that might be she looked quizzical and replied that she'll have to think about it. Somewhat odd, I'd say.

This woman by medical standards should not be alive today, yet she will be returned to her status as mother and wife!  There is a reason for this.  Praying for her continued recovery!

				Where I live there are several individual­s that have had motorcycle accidents. They were NOT wearing a helmet and guess what? they either ended up dead or brain damaged.  In the state of Kentucky if you've had your motorcycle license less than a year you have to wear a helmet. Doesn't make a lot of sense does it? If it's dangerous to the new operator  it's dangerous to the experience­d rider as well.

				There may be many accidents where riders are killed even though wearing helmets, but there sure are a lot more killed because they were not wearing one. My son was killed 4 years ago as a passenger on a motorcycle­. Both he and the driver were thrown from the bike and landed side by side. The driver wearing a helmet? broken collar bone. Son not wearing one, died from severe head trauma. The only injury on him that was fatal.
Why take the chance NOT wearing one?

				Years ago in my hospital,  they would still consult the immediate family (wife, husband, mom, dad) if the patient was an organ donor.  
Also, I am surprised that the husband is a physician and he didn't have his family wear helmets.  He must not work in the ER.

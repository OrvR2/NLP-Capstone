Houston’s Regional Forest: Structure ·  Functions  · Values
From the region’s pine forests and bottomland hardwoods to the street and yard trees that grace our neighborhoods, each tree in the eight-county region surrounding the city of Houston is an integral part of the region’s tree cover. Houston’s Regional Forest: Structure • Functions • Values represents the latest effort to quantify the green infrastructure of the region and is the first report of its kind in Texas. Local leaders can use this new information to help craft effective programs and policies that will sustain tree cover in the region for generations to come.
 
Houston’s Regional Forestreport represents a three-year collaborative effort between Texas Forest Service and the U.S. Forest Service with the assistance of partners such as Houston Advanced Research Center and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

                                    Tickets for the opening of the  9/11 Memorial  in New York City sold out nearly instantly, and are heavily booked already for much of the month.

(Newser) -
                                    The Pentagon has racked up a few late fees for metal containers it has rented and failed to return on time.

Used for storage, building material, and shelter in Iraq and Afghanistan, the 20-foot containers can...

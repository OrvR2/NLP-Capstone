Read more about Amazon Marketplace shipping rates. Some items sold by Amazon Merchants may be shipped internationally. Amazon Merchants set their own shipping rates and policies. Read more about shipping to U.S. protectorates or APO, FPO, or DPO addresses. Your packages may be subject to the customs fees and import duties of the country to which you have your order shipped.

For further details about this service, read about the Amazon Global Program. * Note: Books that require special handling because they are extremely heavy (for example, multi-volume sets) cannot be shipped outside the U.S. If this is the case, it will be noted on the product detail page. Limitations For products shipped internationally, please note that any manufacturer warranty may not be valid; manufacturer service options may not be available; product manuals, instructions and safety warnings may not be in destination country languages; the products (and accompanying materials) may not be designed in accordance with destination country standards, specifications, and labeling requirements; and the products may not conform to destination country voltage and other electrical standards (requiring use of an adapter or converter if appropriate). You are responsible for assuring that the product can be lawfully imported to the destination country. When ordering from Amazon.com, the recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country. Privacy Your privacy is important to us, and we know that you care about how information about your order is used and shared. We would like our international customers and customers shipping products internationally to be aware that cross-border shipments are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities. Also, we may provide certain order, shipment, and product information, such as titles, to our international carriers, and such information may be communicated by the carriers to customs authorities in order to facilitate customs clearance and comply with local laws. If the order is a gift, the package is marked "Gift," but the cost of the item is still stated on the customs form. Customs authorities require the value of the gift item to be stated directly on the package. Returns & Replacements The above terms (including, if applicable, terms related to the Import Fee Deposit) also apply to the shipment of any replacement product that might be shipped if there is a problem with the original shipment. If you return a product to us, you will be the exporter from the destination country. Title and risk of loss transfer to us upon receipt at our fulfillment centers. For additional information please use the "Contact Us" form accessible on the right-side of this page. For products sold by Merchants, please see the applicable Merchant's return and replacement policies. Surcharges for Heavy or Bulky Media ItemsAdditional shipping and handling charges apply to media items of unusual size or weight. See the Help page for your geographical region to determine the actual surcharge amount: Africa Asia & Pacific Atlantic & Caribbean Australia Canada  Europe Israel Japan Latin America Middle EastCustoms, Duties, and Taxes You are responsible for assuring that the product can be lawfully imported to the destination country. When ordering from Amazon.com, the recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country. Orders that are shipped to countries outside of the United States may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates. Purchases of Kindle may be subject to these import taxes, custom duties and fees. These fees can vary widely from country to country. Please contact your local customs office for further information.  Amazon Global Program Import Fees Deposit The Amazon Global Program offers customers a unique service: duty and tax estimation during checkout and customs clearance on your behalf for certain eligible countries. When products are shipped to the eligible countries using eligible ship options included in the Amazon Global Program, an Import Fees Deposit will be estimated and collected for the shipment. With your authorization, such funds will be used by the carrier or another agent to pay the Import Fees on behalf of you (or the recipient's behalf) to the appropriate authorities of the destination country (See detail below). Read below for the answers to further questions about the Import Fees Deposit and applicable Terms and Conditions, and visit our Amazon Global Program store to browse products that are available for shipping to the countries participating in the program. Which products does the Import Fees Deposit apply to? Items sent to eligible countries via Priority International Shipping and in certain cases via Standard or Expedited International Shipping will have an estimated Import Fees Deposit applied to the order. The payment of import fees is the responsibility of the importer and is levied based on the laws of the country into which the products are being shipped.  What if the actual Import Fees are less than the Import Fees Deposit I was charged? If the actual Import Fees (paid by carrier on behalf of the recipient to the customs and tax authorities of the destination country) are less than the Import Fees Deposit collected by us on your behalf, you will automatically be refunded the difference to the payment method you used for the order. You will receive a notification e-mail to confirm the amount of the refund. The process takes 60 days from the shipment date. What if the actual Import Fees are more than the Import Fees Deposit I was charged? For items sold by Amazon Export Sales, Inc., you will not be charged any additional fees if the actual Import Fees exceed the Import Fees Deposit we estimated. For items sold by Merchants, please check the applicable Merchant's policies. How do you estimate the amount of the Import Fees Deposit? The Amazon Global Program uses software to determine the estimated duties, taxes, and fees associated with each item in the order for the destination country selected during the checkout process. How can the estimated Import Fees Deposit differ from the actual import duties and fees payable? The Import Fees Deposit is an estimation of the taxes and duties that may apply and is not an actual calculation of the taxes and duties. In addition, customs regulations and tax rates applicable to certain goods may change between the date the taxes and duties were estimated and the applicable taxes and duties on the date of entry. Also, classification of goods in various countries and regions may be different.  Shipping Rates and Times by Geographical Region When orders shipped internationally reach the destination country, they may be subject to customs clearance procedures which can cause delays beyond original delivery estimates. Click the links below for rates and estimated delivery times for your region. Please note that Merchants participating in the Amazon Global Program may have policies that differ from Amazon Export's terms and conditions. For items you have purchased from a Merchant, please see the applicable Merchant's policies for any other terms and conditions that may apply to your purchase of such items.

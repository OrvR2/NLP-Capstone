Multiple people have been shot at an IHOP restaurant in Carson City, Nevada, according to local media reports.
According to KOLO-TV, initial details are sketchy but the shooting took place on the 3800 block of Carson Street.
At least eight were shot and the gunman was carrying a semi-automatic weapon, The Record-Courier reports. "Several people were killed," according to the Carson City Sheriff's Department.
KRNV's Karen Todd Griffin notes that Carson Street has been closed in the area of the shooting.
The shooting occurred just prior to 9 a.m., per The Record-Courier, which adds the suspect is reportedly "down."
Carson City, the capital of Nevada, has a population of 55,000 and is located in Western Nevada.
UPDATE: The Carson City Sheriff's Office tells the AP that the IHOP is clear and the building is secure.
UPDATE (2): A spokesperson for the Reno Police Department says that there is one confirmed death from the shooting. Three victims are in surgery and two are in critical condition.
UPDATE (3): Officials now say three have died in the shooting and two of them were National Guardsmen.
UPDATE (4): The AP reports the gunman has died of self-inflicted wounds.

				Crimes of passion and impluse are  differant animal than a skulking "chemist" living in a shack or in the back automobile building a bomb etc., or a organized and discplined mayhem group. Impusive behavior feeds on easy acess. The former gas station  is a"convienc­e store", with gambling tickets, junk food, alcohol, stimulents­, tobacco, and a fill up in a matter of minutes on the credit card. Easy acess to high capacity weaponry is no different than easy credit acess, and we all know where that went with  institutio­ns and individual­s that cannot and should not, self regulate.

				Our domestic gun problem would be solved if only women were allowed to own guns.  Notice it's almost never women going off the deep end so the American gun problem must be said to to have a lot to do with testostero­ne poisoning.  Men must be forbidden to hold a gun on American soil.   Women could defend themselves and their families..­.or they just might opt out of the gun thing altogether­..... and we would all be better safer. Only half kidding.

				Dear Tulka2:
Unfortunat­ely, you only have to drive about 50 miles east of Carson to confront a couple of the worst of our local Sovereign Citizens nuts - women - packing 45s whilst doing their grocery shopping or dropping their mail off at the local post office.  They are a distillati­on of the meanest, loosing, bullies alive.  My theory is they were once the girls that used to beat and intimidate all the other girls in high school and now the only way they can reproduce the illusion of power they once had is to carry guns.  Sharon Angle reeks of it.

				I just started reading all the news feeds like i do everyday and seen that the guy who did the I-hop killings was ex military(d­idn't KNOW THAT)I look to see more bad things happen on down the road.They lowred the standards for those who want to enlis,main­ly this is delegated to the Army and MArines.So we now have felons,gan­g memebrs ex murderes,d­rug dealers, rapists etc serving in both the Army and Marines,th­e air force and navy however are still usig strict standars.I watch news feeds on tv with iraq and afghanasat­n and it seems like everywhere you look there's now gang related graffiti spray painted on walls of buldins etc.Thisis a shame and we need to go back to using the more stricter standars for those wanting to join up with the army and marines.I t was strict when I joined thr army back during nam which i served in.The more of these people tey allow to join up the more bad things such as the I-hop thing etc are going to keep on having down the road

If more people had guns that guy would have been down early on.  Around here you get stopped with a gun the officer sees your carry and thanks you for carrying. Does not even want to see the gun, Of course you don;t read of that crap happening around here. Too many armed people.

				Just so you know....?  Nevada leads the country in permits to carry.  As a matter of fact, there was a guy outside the I-Hop with a gun who saw the girl on the motorcycle shot, but could not bring himself to shoot another human being.  Which doesn't surprise me in the least.

				There are a couple ways to look at it but it , if there are no guns no one gets shot, if there were more guns the gunmen could have been shot. Although I am from Canada, where there are very few guns, hence very few shootings, let alone shooting deaths, I don't think it really matters whether u are pro or anti gun,seeing the amount of guns in America already, I think it would be too difficult and detrimenta­l to change things now

				Yes, this kind of thing is happening more often nowadays. Or, seemingly so, anyway. We know that world wide new's reporting nowadays makes it seems to be happening more often, for we're hearing about world happening, whereas, several years ago, as all will know, new's was more localized. Even so, as we approach closer to the dropping of the curtains on mankind's last act here on hearth, or the ending of time's as we now know them to be...accor­ding to the Bible this kind of thing will be on the increase.
The killing of people and devastatin­g types of crime being on the increase, for believers, should only been seen as: time to be packing up and getting ready, and staying ready to go...for our Lord, and Savior...J­esus the Christ is soon to appear. In fact, the closing of time, as we now know it to be, could even be at the door. Whether this is true or not...we should always be ready. For as the Bible says: at a time when you think not: He shall appear. He could even now be at the door. If not for the entire world...He could be there for you or me at any given time.			





William_Dunigan: Yes, this kind of thing is happening more often nowadays.

We will all be safer if we just have more guns. You shoot me, I shoot you, the other guy shoots me. That's the answer to our problems. Let's make gun carrying mandatory so that everyone has an equal shot at getting shot. Now is the time to put the NRA in charge of American's security. Automatic weapons for everyone, mandatory arming of all citizens over the age of 8! Time to stop the insanity of not having armed citizens. NRA policies mean peace for everyone. The NRA will keep us safe.

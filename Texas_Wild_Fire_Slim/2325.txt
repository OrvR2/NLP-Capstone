Note to readers: This story contains sensitive language that some may find offensive.
The family of James C. Anderson, a black man allegedly beaten by a gang of seven white teenagers who then mowed him down with a pickup truck in Jackson, Mississippi, filed a wrongful death lawsuit today.
The suit filed by the family’s attorney, Winston J. Thompson III, with cooperation from the Southern Poverty Law Center claims that after a night of drinking, the teenagers set out to "go fuck with some niggers." After finding Anderson, 49, in a motel parking lot early in the morning of June 26, the group set upon him, taking turns beating him as they yelled "White Power!", according to the lawsuit filed in Hinds County Circuit Court. Then, the suit continues, some of the crew ran him over with a Ford F-250.
Anderson's killing sparked a national outcry, and video of the beating captured by a nearby security camera was broadcast on CNN. The family is now seeking punitive damages.
"Anyone who knew James could see that he was a caring man with a beautiful smile," said Barbara Anderson Young, Anderson's eldest sister, in a statement released today. "He was such a compassionate person. We must take an honest look at the racial climate that motivated some young people to hurt such a wonderful person."
Of the seven teens that the lawsuit alleges were involved in Anderson's killing –- Deryl Dedmon Jr., John Aaron Rice, William Kirk Montgomery, Sarah Graves, Shelbie Richards, John Blaylock and Dylan Butler -- only Dedmon, 19, and Rice, 18, have been charged by authorities.
Dedmon has been charged with capital murder and robbery. Rice has been charged with simple assault.
 "The whole world saw the brutal attack that James Anderson suffered at the hands of people who simply wanted to hurt someone of a different race," said Thompson. "We cannot ignore such cold-hearted cruelty."
The lawsuit details a liquor-fueled gathering of teens: “During one of the gatherings, Defendants joined together to, in Dedmon's words, go fuck with some niggers."
They then piled into two vehicles, a green Ford F-250 driven by Dedmon and a white Jeep Cherokee driven by Montgomery, and headed for Jackson, according to the lawsuit.
The group in the Jeep noticed a black man, who turned out to be Anderson, in the parking lot of the Metro Inn and called Dedmon to the scene. Some of the teens stayed in the vehicles as lookouts, while Dedmon, Rice, Butler and Blaylock got out and approached Anderson, the lawsuit claims. Soon after, the attack was on.
"At one point, a Defendant yelled White Power!" according to the suit.
After the beating, the group in the Jeep drove off, it continues. But Dedmon and others in the Ford headed out of the parking lot and drove head-on into Anderson, who was stumbling through a grassy area near the motel's entrance.
According to the lawsuit: "After hitting Anderson, Dedmon immediately informed the other Defendants that he had ran that nigger over."
"James Anderson lost his life for no other reason than the color of his skin," said Morris Dees, chief trial counsel for the SPLC in a statement. "Those responsible must be held accountable for their callous and deadly actions. We are filing this lawsuit today to ensure his family gets a measure of justice."
The suit includes claims of battery, negligence and wrongful death.
According to reports, Dedmon's attorney, Lee Agnew, said during a court hearing in July that he has seen nothing to back up any "racial allegations."

				This is such a sad story and all the bickering over which race gets picked on the most is nauseating to say the least. A modern day lynching IS newsworthy­, whether the victim is black, white or purple. A person was targeted for something they could not help: the color of their skin. Now parents are without a child, a spouse is without their partner, children without a father. I know it is hard for people to see through their own paranoia and victim hood to have empathy for this man, but this isn't about your cousin's friend's sisters mother who got mugged or had their purse/car/­whatever stolen. It cheapens this man's memory and the heinous way he died when people want to make this into "my race is done wrong more because we're this or that," or "why don't your hear more about that race because they do more."  How about we just acknowledg­e that hatred exists, it's a real, SERIOUS problem that needs to be addressed in this country and work to have no more repeats of James Anderson's death? That should be the real discussion here.

				But you don't seem to have an issue with the numerous, choleric comments directed at the "melanin deficient"­. Spare us the crocodile tears. No one is trying to cheapen this man's memory [sic]. They're addressing the numerous bigots who're using this story as a vehicle to vilify white Americans.

				The latest DOJ stats show black on white violent crime happens far more often than the inverse. This is no reason not to be outraged by the crime cited in this article. It is, however, reason to avoid the anti-white knee-jerki­ng seen in so many of the posts below.

				Not hate crimes per se but hate crime charges. There's a stark difference­. Hate crime charges are rarely levied when the victims are white unless sexual orientatio­n is shown as a motive. The justice system's approach to the recent rash of black on white, flash mob violence is clear evidence that the hate crime designatio­n is not applied evenly. The incident at the Wisconsin State fair is the first of many where some of the perpetrato­rs are being charged under hate crime laws. Prosecuter­s looked the other way on the rest. Why?

				Blacks rarely target other races for crime soley because they're white.  Crime by blacks is almost always a crime for financial gain.  This is usually a function of living in poverty with little or no hope of gainful employment­.  Poor people, meaning irrespecti­ve of race/color­, commit financial gain crimes.  This is a crime against the black solely based on the race of the person.

				For all the people on here complainin­g about the disparity of in coverage of black on white crimes vs. white on black crimes, take a minute to ask yourself why there's a disparity in coverage of white children and women who go missing vs. black children and women. Or how crime is even reported in the media. When it comes to the way blacks are portrayed in the media, whites will always come out on top. Sometimes, it's better to be quiet and let people think you're ignorant rather than open your mouth and prove them right.

				What does the disparity, real or alleged, in reporting of missing women and children have to do with the disparity in coverage of white on black vs black on white crimes? These are different issues entirely that can only be debated and addressed on their own merits. Or would you prefer we allow each to flurish in the name of vicarious justice. Doesn't seem very productive or civil.

				My God!  My God!  Man's inhumanity to man.  The current political climate evidenced by the gross lack of respect for President Obama by the RepubTeaBa­ggers and the systematic dismantlin­g of the rights of the common man by Republican governors and legislator­s throughout America, and the rebirth of poll taxes or so-called voter ID laws designed to disenfranc­hise African Americans fuels this type of hatred.

				Hey Anglo Americans maybe you folks not enslave black people we would be talking about racism in America and don't going make up stuff that it never happen because you still have 9 million Anglo in my country in South Africa that's complainin­g about the ANC and 2 million white Namibians complaing about Black majority rule. Maybe the only way to end this conflict is 40 million black leave America then 12 million whites that still live in this continent ought to leave.

				The one thing I can't quite figure out, legal people help me, is this a civil case being brought against the perpetrato­rs?  How does this differ from the charges that will be brought by the local/stat­e justice system.  Is this similar to what happened in the OJ Simpson case, innocent on criminal charges then brought up in a civil suite.  

Well, either way I hope and expect the driver will be going away for a long time and his associates are going to see some time also.  BTW - Do they have the death penalty in Mississipp­i?

				In this case, the justice system is overseen by two distinct entities.  There is criminal court, where the State will bring criminal charges against the defendants and there is civil court, where family members can present a lawsuit.  They operate on different rules.  

In criminal court, the state must prove beyond reasonable doubt, that the defendants are guilty of a crime.  If the jury unanimousl­y so finds, the defendants will be sentenced by the Judge presiding over the hearings.  In Civil court, the plaintiffs­, must prove in court by a prepondera­nce of evidence that the defendants harmed the victim in some way.  It only requires a majority (different in various states) for the jury to rule in favor.  The judge or jury will determine monetary values for the harm caused.  Sometimes there are punitive damages to be awarded too.

				I find it so telling that so many ra cists run to the "Black Voices" section here.  This website has approximat­ely 85-90% of stories that center on White people or their stories.  Why are so many unglued that H P has sought to include a racial or ethnic centered section?  Why do you flock here?  To prove a point?  For attention?  Are you that lonely?

And yes, I am White but I don't run to a part of a site that is marketed and targeted for a certain group to participat­e in just to post the complete opposite or to tr0ll.  

It would be like me running to one of your sites.....­stormfront or aryannatio­nsingles etc. just to post anti-r@cis­m.  The fear from you people is laughable.  Yes, I posted "you people."

				It's real simple, really.  Blacks gravitate to areas that they find culturally comfortabl­e.  That comfort is bolstered by familiarit­y.  The fact is, culturally­, blacks and whites are quite different.  There is nothing wrong with that, it just is.  

For example, blacks play a card game that only blacks play.  We shorten the name to "bid" although the full name is "bid whist."  I can guarantee you, only a very tiny percentage of whites know the game and an even smaller percentage know how to play.  But most blacks know of the game and most can play too.  This is just a tiny example of the cultural difference­s in race. 

NEXT!

				"....while the daily black-on-w­­hite attacks go mostly unreported­­, reported only by local newspapers­­..."

Hmm, so it's unreported­, but yet reported?  Now there's a puzzler.  I can see why people might be upset by that.  

"...but “whited out” of local TV and national newspaper coverage, or reported without informing viewers of the respective races of the attackers and victim. "

Oh wait, now I get it.  It's reported, but just not with the slant and fabricatio­ns you prefer to read into it.  Well, that does change things doesn't it?  I guess Mr. Anderson should have thought about that when he was being pummeled - he might have understood things more clearly.    Thanks for your justificat­ion of the irrational white anger leading to his death.

Perry leaves Texas wildfires, heads to GOP debateBy WILL WEISSERT - Associated Press | AP – 5 hrs ago




Related ContentRepublican presidential candidate Texas Gov. Rick Perry, center, is met by Frederick …Republican presidential candidate Texas Gov. Rick Perry arrives for a Republican …

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Gov. Rick Perry left wildfire-ravaged Texas on Wednesday and flew to California to debate his Republican presidential rivals, deciding that the chance to deliver his message to a national audience outweighed any criticism he might receive for not being at the scene of a home-state emergency.Perry's move surprised some political experts and appeared to violate a cardinal rule of disaster politics for chief executives. Democrats immediately questioned his judgment. "If Perry stayed at home to work on the fires I don't think there would be any room for criticism. But this opens it up for his opponents to hit him on this issue," said Matt Angle, director of the Texas Democratic Trust, which supports Democratic candidates statewide.But after two-plus days monitoring the firefighting effort and talking to residents evacuated from some of the hardest-hit areas, Perry said he could safely return to the campaign trail. He was scheduled to participate in a televised debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., Wednesday night, then remain in the West for two days of fundraisers in San Diego, Los Angeles, Fresno and other cities.Some Republican observers argued Perry's decision won't cost him as long as the firefighting operation is well managed. Calmer winds have helped authorities gain a measure of control of the largest blazes in Central Texas, which have scorched 33,000 acres and destroyed more than 1,000 homes in the past three days alone."The public understands his job is to be governor, not fireman," said veteran GOP analyst Alex Castellanos, who worked on President George W. Bush's re-election campaign. "Americans know he can meet both his responsibilities as governor and as a Republican candidate."When asked about being outside Texas when the worst wildfires started over the weekend, Perry said, "we've been multitasking in this state for a long time."Before Wednesday night's debate, Perry discussed the fires while chatting backstage with some of his fellow candidates. Herman Cain and then Mitt Romney asked the governor how Texas was faring."Have they been brought under control?" Romney asked, talking across the room to Perry."It's still too early to tell," Perry responded. "They're serious, they're mean."Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who is acting governor in Perry's absence, said he will sign a request that the federal government declare Texas a major disaster area. "I'm in constant communication with Gov. Perry," Dewhurst said.President Barack Obama on Wednesday telephoned Perry assuring him that requests for additional assistance would be quickly assessed. The White House said Obama made clear that the federal government will continue to provide assistance to state and local officials fighting the fire.The political risk for a chief executive who does not personally oversee disaster response was underscored in 2005 when President Bush was sharply criticized for the troubled federal relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina. Since then, governors and presidents have taken a visible role at disaster sites, and many expected Perry to leave his campaign on hold longer than he did.The wildfire response "gives Perry an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, to demonstrate decisiveness and at the same time empathy and caring," said Todd Harris, a Republican consultant. He added, however, that "you can't do anything that looks, sounds or smells even remotely political."But Perry's calculation changed as the presidential debate approached. For his campaign, it was a prime opportunity for a candidate who, while leading the Republican field in recent polls, is an unknown quantity for most voters outside Texas.Todd Olsen, an Austin Republican consultant who has worked both for Perry and for his past opponents, said Perry needs to show  he can hold his own in a debate with better-known GOP contenders like Mitt Romney."It's the one debate where you can walk in and say, 'I've got one job and one job only, and that is tell voters who I am'," Olsen said. He said Perry had done everything expected of a governor coping with disaster.In Central Texas, several residents said they didn't understand why Perry came back to lead the recovery effort, only to leave while the fires were still burning."I'm a little disappointed after what he said the other day about pushing politics aside because Texans are his first priority," said Guylaine Williett of Bastrop, who lives near an area that was severely burned.  "Now he's out on the campaign trail." The fires in this part of Central Texas near Austin have claimed two lives and almost 800 homes."He's abandoning his state," said Jose "Pepe" Gomez, 57, the owner of a construction management business whose girlfriend's house was destroyed.The governor's office says state disaster officials are highly experienced, having dealt with the threat for months. Wildfires statewide have destroyed more than 3.5 million acres — an area roughly the size of Connecticut — since December.Since formally joining the race nearly a month ago, Perry has been a frequent visitor to key early battleground states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. According to a Gallup poll released Aug. 23, Perry was recognized by 67 percent of Republicans and Republican leaners nationwide, well behind Romney and Michele Bachmann.Wednesday's event could help change that, as well as give Perry more debate experience for the long campaign. Perry took part in just four debates total while campaigning for governor."Perry's people are very disciplined," said Angle, of the Texas Democratic Trust. "They've figured out that any flack they get for leaving the fires they can deal with later."

It's cool though because Perry is still praying for rain to stop the drought, and put those fires out.

Why are folks griping about Perry leaving TX to attend a debate?  He already inspected the area, what more can he do?  Democrats have no room to talk considering the vacations Obama took during the oil spill (remember that little problem) and this horrible economic downturn.  Those that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

Gingrich, Santorum, and Cain need to drop out and thin this field to viable candidates. It looks like Bachman is running for VP already. Huntsman is right in that it is early and he has some time but time is shorter now and he needs to score big or focus on the VP himself. Paul could have made a good run but he is too honest to avoid the radical statements that always marginalize him. You all know what I am talking about with the legalizing of drugs and elimination of disaster relief. Still not sure what Palin is doing, she needs to get out of the way as she is proving a distraction, actually getting more press than Romney. Seems very unorganized.

Perry runs up a 29 Billion debt in Texas while governor, and now that there's a natural disaster and he should be there helping out, he holds his hand out to the feds like a welfare recipient.  Is that not Republicanism at it's finest?

The bush recession has cost us over 14 million jobs from 2007-2011. Only the republicans stopped counting the numbers the day bush left office. They lack the common sense to admit that just because bush left office does not mean that his problems that he created for the world do not carry on.

Armed with all this information the Governor cut fire services by 75% this year now that's showing leadership.

"The public understands his job is to be governor, not fireman," said veteran GOP analyst Alex Castellanos,
 Yes we all understand and it's just a well that we do seing as Perry has cut all the fire services in Texas. It has to be the most under funded state in the USA when it comes to fire fighters and to think they made these cuts this year. Lets see cut back fire service and drop to your knees and pray for rain.
Cant wait for President Prerry.

I'm a Democrat, but I see nothing wrong with his attending the debate.  We have phones and computers.  He can stay in touch.

That said, I'm not sure staying for two more days of fundraising is the best action.  Only time will tell.

I wish "Conservatives would remember that statement when they start to attack Obama.

It sure is funny how all these "Conservatives" defend Perry when he runs off to get his face on TV when his state is having a disaster, yet blast Obama for not being in NY the minute it started to rain during Irene.

Perry shows his true colors. It's about Politics, stupid!!!! He spent 3 days "managing the fires" that have been burning for almost 300 days. First chance he gets, off he goes. He could not care less about Texans.

If god talks to slick, why the hell doesn't slick ask the god/s why the #$%$ so much of Texas is a living hell right now?  A large part of the Bastrop Lost Pines State Park has burned in the central Texas fire.  If whatever gods there be were truly on slick's side, don't you think that said god/s would send some rain to our state?

It's too bad that the article did not point out that slick rick gutted the state assistance to volunteer fire departments across the state. Maybe there is such a thing as karma after all.

Red lingerie to lure Hungarians online for censusBy Krisztina Than, editing by Paul Casciato | Reuters – 12 hrs ago






BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary has produced a provocative video advertisement to encourage more people to fill out its national census online next month.
In a video posted on social networking sites Wednesday, a topless young woman in red underwear, lacy black stockings and holding a whip opens the door to a census taker, who, realizing he has arrived at an inopportune moment -- offers her the option of completing the census online.
(For the video please see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71d7gzymPA0)
"We want to reach the younger generation as well, and the internet is more for this generation, it uses their language," Imre Dobossy, a top communications official at the Central Statistics Office (KSH) told Reuters.
The last time Hungarians were counted was 10 years ago, and this will be first time they will be able to fill out the questionnaire online.
More than 37,000 census takers will collect data nationwide in October, the KSH said on its official census website http://www.nepszamlalas.hu/index.php?langcode=en.

Europe is different from the US, from a hedonistic point of view.

The age of consent in most european countries is only 14 - 15 years, in some countries (like Spain) is even 13.

Hungarians tend to not tan well, therefore white teddies are out of the question.

America is very uptight about nudity as a whole, and censor it, Europeans welcome it.

New Month Brings New Laws to Texas

September 1st marked an important day for Texas — more than 700 new laws passed during the last legislative session officially went into effect. Many of the laws affect important civil legal issues important to low-income Texans including laws that expand protective orders to pets and victims of teen dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.
A few great overviews of the new laws are below:

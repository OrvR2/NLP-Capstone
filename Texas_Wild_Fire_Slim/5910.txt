It's hard to imagine Sarah Jessica Parker's well-heeled "Sex and the City" heroine in a decidedly unstylish minivan (well, even more so considering Carrie didn't drive). 
But when the actress appeared on "Nightline" last night to promote "I Don't Know How She Does It," she advised Katie Couric to "respect the van":
My mother is a huge Honda fan... so I called up Bronx Honda, because my mother told me to, and we got ourselves a minivan. I'm telling you, it's the most wonderful car.
Ms. Bradshaw, of course, would be much more given to touting the merits of Manolos. But it seems that's the one topic of which Parker's grown weary. "I get tired of talking about, 'Well, you must love shoes,'" she admitted to Couric.
However that's not to say the actress has lost interest in all things fashion. Parker's empire has grown to include three fragrances and until recently, she was heading up Halston Heritage.
Sarah Jessica's also perpetually known for taking red carpet risks, such as when she channeled Little Red Riding Hood at her new movie's premiere last week.
Parker is still happy to be linked with her sartorially obsessed alter ego, telling ABC, "Talking about Carrie Bradshaw is still the thrill. If that is the association, if that is the identity, I'm very proud of it."
See the entire "Nightline" interview below.

				SJP looks fab!  Can't wait to see the new movie.  However, she simply cannot, under no circumstan­ces, compare her world of serious loot, nannies, drivers, hair stylists, personal shoppers, secretarie­s, etc., to that of the ordinary working mom which for all intents and purposes, she didn't.  And that was good!

TV newscasters are not generally a stylish bunch. Skirt suits reign supreme, with the occasional garish splash of color or a bad piece of jewelry.
But every so often a fashionable lady takes a seat at the table and makes the news interesting again. We were reminded of this by the chic Alina Cho, who took the New York Times through her daily wardrobe for a week in the most recent "What I Wore" feature. 
Turns out, Cho's closet is full of  Zac Posen ("an old friend"), Prabal Gurung, Haider Ackermann, plenty of J. Crew and Yves Saint Laurent Trib Too pumps. It's enough to make a girl turn green with envy.
Inspired by Cho's covetable wardrobe, we rounded up nine more of the most stylish women anchoring the news these days.
Click through below and tell us: which woman has got smarts and style?

Erin Andrews may be a major reason so many people tune in to watch ESPN sports. If you're not paying attention to the score of the game, it's probably because you're distracted by the blonde bombshell reporter. Not surprisingly, the ESPN beauty was named "America's Sexiest Sportscaster" by Playboy two years in a row. (Getty photos)

				Easy answer:  Because male journalist­s are not FIRST chosen and judged by their looks.

Viz:  Morley Safer.  If he were Marian Safer, do you think she'd be on the air?  Roberta Schieffer?  Willa Cronkite?  Tomasina Brokaw?

And don't get me started on the sports on air talent.  Ok, here's one:  Johanna Madden.

				It is just women who are constantly scrutinize­d.  I am sick of seeing Bikini Bods,  if we must have pics of women in swimsuits, why not a pic of a man right next to it?   Advertisin­g is also constantly aimed at women, you would think men never wrinkle, gain weight or pee themselves (Depends).  Let's put more pressure on men, see how they like it!  Apparently­. the only thing men want to buy is Viagra

				No Shawn Robinson?  Really?  This list is overtly...­.uff....I won't bother pointing out the obvious about this list and skin color.  I'll just point out that the topic is kinda silly and the authors did not do their research.  Barbara Walter, with whom I love, looked awful in that green monstrosit­y.  Katie Couric didn't look so hot nor does Ann Curry in her photos.  As a matter of fact, Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Cobb should be on this list.  This list is a disaster!  

It appears that the two ladies responsibl­e for this article just wanted to pay homage to the women in new that they admire.

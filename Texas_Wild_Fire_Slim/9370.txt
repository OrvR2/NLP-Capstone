Man Busted for Breaking Into Celine Dion's Mansion, Snacking, Bathing

Posted Wed Sep 7, 2011 6:17am PDT by Caryn Ganz in Amplifier



A man named Daniel Bedard has been arrested for breaking into Céline Dion's Montreal mansion, eating dessert, and running himself a bath. According to the AP, the 36-year-old suspect gained entry to the singer's house fairly easily -- he hopped a fence, located a garage door opener in an unlocked car, and waltzed right in. Once inside, the intruder made himself at home quite literally. (Dion, her husband Rene Angelil, and their children were not present at the Quebec residence at the time.) "He opened the water faucets, was pouring a nice warmish bath [and] he even managed to eat some pastry that was in the fridge," police spokesman Franco Di Genova said. According to the BBC, "Snack wrappers were then discovered in the kitchen, as well as cigarette butts and discarded notes in an office." An alarm notified cops of a break-in, and when officers came upon the suspect, he even asked them, " 'Hey guys, what are you doing here?' " to which cops essentially responded, um, back at you, dude. The perp, thinking on his feet, then told authorities he was a family friend, the BBC reports. After confirming Bedard was not expected at the residence, he was arrested, charged with breaking and entering, car theft, and causing property damage, and released.Perhaps Bedard should get in touch with the two brave, clueless men who busted into 50 Cent's house, drank wine, and hid in a closet. There could be a blog-to-book deal in here somewhere.Follow The Amplifier on Twitter for all your rock-star break-in news. See Also:• Celine Dion Does Not Want to Be Mocked on the Internet [Photo: Isaac Brekken/WireImage.com]

Among the many cultural commodities currently fascinating Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Public, few seem to have as strong a pull as "Dancing With The Stars." This near-reality television show combines celebrity star power with a dance competition to create a potent programming powerhouse.
The legions of fans waiting with baited breath to see athletes like Hope Solo and Ron Artest compete in the upcoming season may eventually be watching Novak Djokovic on the hit ABC show. 
The world's No. 1 ranked tennis player, Djokavic is no stranger to the rigors of DWTS, and, after his defeat of Nikolay Davdyenko on Saturday at the U.S. Open, he gave the selection committee for DWTS an audition tape to consider once his tennis career winds down. 
The display, which will hopefully live on for generation via GIF's, was certainly not out of character for Djokovic. Just last month the star dressed up like Maria Sharapova, played a prank on a reporter to get a laugh, and, of course, danced on Jay Leno.
Although Djokovic's dance moves on Leno left something to be desired, he seems to be doing well enough at his day job that he won't have to worry about trading in his tennis shoes for capezios and hoofing it to make ends meet. Firstly, he advanced to the quarterfinals of the Open after defeating Alexandr Dolgopolov in straight sets. Secondly, he, along with the most ambulatory folks in the free world, is still a better dancer than Mark Madsen.

SALVATION ARMY CENTRAL TEXAS WILDFIRE RESPONSE ENTERS
SECOND PHASE



					Published 09/12/2011
						 - 7:21 a.m. CST 
				













 DALLAS, TX â Salvation Army staff and volunteers
continue to serve in Central Texas communities
that have been devastated by wildfires during the
last seven days. The Bastrop County fire, that has
so far destroyed 1,554 homes, was reported to be
50% contained, Sunday. Since Thursday, The
Salvation Army has provided 9,421 drinks, 2,246
snacks and 398 meals in Bastrop County. Mobile
feeding units continued to support firefighters
through Saturday although Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) forces are now assuming
responsibility for feeding centers in the area.
The Salvation Army has completed a two-day
campaign, partnering with 
Walmart and local NBC
affiliate KXAN, providing donation centers where
staff and volunteers collected household items,
cleaning supplies, first
 aid and medial
supplies, toiletries, diapers and other basic
necessities.

LEADER MARKET LETTER


							Published 09/12/2011
								 - 6:20 a.m. CST 
						













 âOne cannot refuse to eat just because there is a
chance of choking.â - Chinese proverb



	Stocks tumbled Friday to give up earlier
gains in the week as the Dow 
Jones Industrials
fell below 11000 for the first time since August
22. 
The Dow has had triple digit moves in 19 of
its past 24 sessions. 
NASDAQ lost 0.5% for the
week and is -7% since January 1.



	Stocks are lower so far in 2011 but are
entering their seasonally 
strongest four months.
Since 1995, the last four months of the year
have showed positive returns averaging 8.5% in
every year except 2008. 
And for all the
headlines about how lousy stocks are doing,
consider 
that the S&P 500 is +4% since last
September 11.

														Credits:  US Congress photo gallery 
													




 "Studies have revealed that -- depending on which
ones you believe -- between $30 and $60 billion
are lost to theft and waste in the Medicare
program each year. Imagine how much more taxpayer
money will be stolen as a result of Obamacare
fraud and corruption," said political strategist
Mike Baker. A nationwide dragnet by
Justice Department Strike Force investigators in
eight U.S. cities has resulted in charges against
91 defendants, including doctors, nurses, and
other medical professionals, for their alleged
participation in Medicare fraud schemes involving
approximately $295 million in false billing,
according to reports obtained by the National
Association of Chiefs of Police.

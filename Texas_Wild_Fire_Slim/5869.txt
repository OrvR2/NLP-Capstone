UPDATE 9/7/11:Prominent liberal Christians are joining the chorus of protest over the lack of clergy participating in the Sept. 11 memorial ceremony on Sunday. While protest over the "clergy ban" was mostly limited to conservative religious voices last week, a group of self-described progressive evangelicals will hold a press conference on Friday near ground zero to voice their concern that "religion should not be excluded from 9/11 remembrances," according to a press release.

The group is led by the Rev. Jim Wallis, President and CEO of Sojourners, a Washington D.C.-based magazine and Christian organization, who will speak at the conference. Other scheduled speakers include the Rev. Geoff Tunnicliffe, CEO and Secretary General, World Evangelical Alliance; David Gushee, a professor of Christian ethics at Mercer University; and the Rev. Floyd Flake, a former Democratic congressman and the Senior Pastor of the African Methodist Episcopal Greater Allen Cathedral in New York City. Friday's event will also include video statements from several unnamed international evangelical leaders.
"Global Evangelical leaders are calling for peace and unity and believe that while religion has historically been the cause of conflict, it can also serve as a solution," says the event's press release. It later continues: "The Evangelical leaders will give examples of Christians and Muslims living together peacefully and call for Christians to be good neighbors to the Muslim community."
When the Sept. 11 memorial is dedicated with a solemn ceremony of remembrance at ground zero this year, the names of the 2,983 deceased will be read by victims' families interspersed with remarks from city officials and politicians, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and President Barack Obama. But some Christian religious leaders complain that other important voices will not be heard.
A growing group of mostly conservative Christian leaders say organizers have shut out clergy and formal prayers from this year's annual 9/11 observance, which has taken on additional significance as the 10th anniversary of the attacks approaches and the long-awaited memorial opens.
"It's unbelievable," says Richard Land, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, who has been sending email blasts to constituents about the the lack of clergy. "We live in a country where the overwhelming majority of people identify as Christian or have a religion, and clergy were some of the first people to respond on 9/11 to minister to victims. Why aren't they welcome today?"
Clergy have never been an official part of the 10 remembrance ceremonies at ground zero, which include one six months after the attacks and one on each 9/11 anniversary since. Instead, the events have featured moments of silence during which audiences may reflect and pray. Six such moments are planned this year -- two to recall when each of the twin towers was struck, two to recall when each tower fell, one to mark Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania, and one to remember the attack on the Pentagon. But while there has been little controversy over the lack of formal religion at previous ceremonies, this year's event has generated petitions and responses from religious figures across the country.
In addition to Land, influential conservative Christian groups, including the American Family Association, the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights and the Family Research Council, have called on Bloomberg to change course, as has the televangelist Rev. Pat Robertson.
"I'm stunned. This event affected the whole psyche and soul of the country, and you are going to have no prayer? What's a memorial service if you are going to leave God out of it completely? It seems kind of hollow," said Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, which has sent "action alerts" to its 2.3 million subscribers urging them to write to Bloomberg to protest the ceremony lineup.
The Family Research Council, led by Tony Perkins, has also been sending notices to its base. Since launching a petition last week that says the clergy exclusion is "offensive to the families of victims" and "strangely overlooks the role that faith played in bringing healing to countless lives," the group has gathered more than 53,000 signatures.
Despite objections, Bloomberg's office has said it won't change the 9/11 plans.
"The ceremony was designed in coordination with 9/11 families with a mixture of readings that are spiritual, historical and personal in nature. It has been widely supported for the past 10 years and rather than have disagreements over which religious leaders participate we would like to keep the focus of our commemoration ceremony on the family members of those who died. This year's six moments of silence allow every individual a time for personal and religious introspection," Evelyn Erskine, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said in an email.
Erskine added that while clergy have never been a formal part of the event, they have attended in previous years, including some who are relatives of 9/11 victims. Those clergy have been allowed to read names of victims like any other family member.
In one of his recent weekly radio shows, Bloomberg warned that the event "cannot be political" and said it would offer a "poem or quote or something that each one of the readers will read" with "no speeches whatsoever."
“There’s an awful lot of people that would like to participate, but you just can’t do that once you open it up. So the argument here is, it’s elected officials and those who were there at the time and had some influence," the mayor said on the show.
Among those calling for formal religious representation, there are differing views on which clergy should be invited. Land of the Southern Baptist Convention said there should be a "Catholic priest, Protestant minister, rabbi and imam." Wildmon said that in a country where "the Christian religion is dominant in terms of numbers, a Catholic or Protestant would be appropriate." In a blog post, Dave Silverman, president of American Atheists, wrote that all religious representatives should take part as long as there is "an invocation on behalf of nonreligious people."
Not all religious leaders are objecting to the ceremony's lineup.
"Many people would understandably prefer to see a presence of clergy, but priority must be given to families of victims -- that is the overriding concern," said Rabbi Joseph Potasnik, executive vice president of the New York Board of Rabbis. "If you do include clergy, then the question becomes, 'Which faiths should be represented, which are not represented, how does one include everyone?'"
Potasnik said that the controversy "should not overshadow all the progress and work that has been done by and among different faiths" since 9/11 and noted that other commemorative events will have clergy and prayer. These include an event organized by the New York Police Department on Sept. 8 at Lincoln Center, which will include Rabbi Alvin Kass, the chief of chaplains for the NYPD; Cardinal Edward Egan, the archbishop emeritus of New York; and Bloomberg. Representatives of the Archdiocese of New York are participating in several 9/11-related events, and the Interfaith Center of New York is also hosting many 9/11-related gatherings.

Paul Brandeis Raushenbush: Ten Years After 9/11: Has Religion Driven Us Apart or Drawn Us Together?


							            							            9/11 made it clear that religion, which had been ignored and overlooked for decades, was still a force, and perhaps the force in people's personal and communal lives.							        



 






Eboo Patel: 9/11: Ten Years On


							            							            After 9/11, I viewed the Quran as a balm for my country's pain, especially lines from Ayat al-Kursi: "His throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them." 							        



 






Maria Mayo: Remembering 9/11: Between Forgiveness and Revenge


							            							            When the quest for justice becomes a manhunt, the cycle repeats. And when forgiveness comes too early or too easily, the cycle stands to repeat again. 							        



 






Georgette Bennett, Ph.D.: Tanenbaum Center 9/11 Reflection: For a Unified, Understanding New York


							            							            If we can continue building bridges, if the voices of pluralism can be heard above the din of the frightened and hateful, I will consider us well on the way to building an inclusive society.							        



 






Rev. Dr. Martha R. Jacobs: Playing Poker With Police At Ground Zero


							            							            I am so thankful for the opportunity to serve those who were there to protect us and recover the remains of those who died. It was not something I ever envisioned when I answered a call to serve God.							        



 






Clarence B. Jones: The 10th Anniversary of 9/11: A Unique Opportunity for Presidential Leadership


							            							            The 10th anniversary of 9/11 provides us with a "teachable moment" to determine just what kind of nation we want to be: one dedicated to peace and non-violence, or one trapped in the pursuit of violence as a hallmark of our foreign policy?							        



 






Rev. Emily C. Heath: What I'll Say on Sunday: Hurricanes and Theology From a Preacher in Vermont


							            							            A week later, I'm sitting here trying to figure out what to say on Sunday morning. Ministers are in this unique position where, even in the midst of a natural disaster, we have fifteen uninterrupted minutes to talk on Sundays. No one gets fifteen minutes in a crisis. This is not lost on me. 							        



 






Mike MacIntosh: God's Love Was at Ground Zero


							            							            The aroma of God's love was in every stairwell, office suite and any imaginable place at the WTC.  His love was reaching out to very frightened people and loving them into heaven.

				I find the update just really irritating­.  Pastor Jim Wallace traveled on up from Washington­, D.C., where he gets paid $161,835 a year to publish a religious magazine, to voice his concern that "religion should not be excluded from 9/11 remembranc­es".  Why didn't he stay in Washington­, D.C., and mention it to the President when he speaks at the National Cathedral on Sunday, 9/11? 

Do these huge egos really think they have a right to insert their minority sect into every single ceremony and commemorat­ion and remembranc­e everywhere in the country?  Or only the ones being carried live on TV?

Is the idea that they are going to harass the bereaved parents, siblings, spouses and children into allowing them to shove their way into the limelight?  Or is the idea that the Mayor, as the respresent­ative of the supposed secular government­, is going to force the bereaved to include a religious ceremony they DON'T WANT for a religion most of them DON'T SHARE.

Who do these rude, overbearin­g people think they are, that entitles them to wander in from out of town and try to harass the families into letting them be the center of attention?  This is just sickening.

				Everyone who attends or watches via media brings their own faith to this event.  There's no reason to provide a pulpit to a few organized churches.  Every man, woman and child carries their faith in their own soul.  The moments of silence allow for every possible belief system at one time.  No one is excluded, it is all inclusive. Not everyone is christian, folks.  No does everyone want to listen to the din of words when communing with their deity from their hearts.  This is the ultimate in religious tolerance.­.

				What Mayor Bloomberg fails to remember is that the first recorded death on 9/11 was Fr. Mychal Judge (the Catholic chaplain of the FDNY).  His death certificat­e was #0001.  There is a famous photo of firefighte­rs carrying his body out of the rubble and laying him on the altar at St. Peter's church.  What is wrong with you Mr. Mayor?

				I'm sure he remembers, but what's your point? If #0001 had been a dentist, would we need to invite more dentists? Lots of good folks died that day, but no religions did. Let's focus on the human loss, not the more tangential and subjective issue of religious faith. If you really think a member of the clergy should be there, then you're really just thinking of yourself, not those who died.

				I'm getting the impression nobody WANTS to remember all the good folks who died that day, because they don't seem to want their families memorializ­ing them.  They are fixated on the *heroism* of the 343 firefighte­rs who died, and the *heroism* of those who arrived later, and seem to have forgotten there were 2,409 people who the *heroes* did not, had no chance of, rescuing.  Most of the people on the upper floors were doomed from the minute a plane breached their tower and the fires started. 

It seems problemati­c for those families whose loved ones didn't have a chance and whose great respect for the firefighte­rs is not based on personal gratitude for rescue to have people attempting­, again, to change the memorial service for their dead into another one for the firefighte­rs.

The families want to put their vitally important 2,409 lost at the center of this, and some seem to think they don't deserve that.  All this 'it's not too much to ask them to allow'?  Yeah, it is. This one is not about *heroes* or *religion'­s comfort* or *healing the nation*.  This particular one is about ordinary people in their normal routine having their lives snuffed out randomly by religious fanatics.

Nobody wants to think about that, too depressing­.  Don't want to look at the sad faces of their survivors, too scary.  Let's think about *heroes*, because if this happens again, we'll be able to pretend that someone will be able to save us.

				Yes, it IS too much to ask, because that is NOT what the families want.

The families want the six minutes of silence.  The families do not want to have their memorial spoiled by having some profession­al who isn't even their religion say prayers at them.  They want to say their OWN PRAYERS all by themselves­.   Why should anybody else be able to horn in and insist the families' change the traditiona­l plan?  

I find it astonishin­g so many people here assume there's some sort of extra value in prayers when the people speaking them are being paid to do so.

				A chaplin is defined as 1) memeber of clergy attached to a special group ( this case nypd or fdny)2 A person chosen to conduct religious exercises ( in this case nypd or nyfd for example preforming last rites) So it will be representi­ng one group. . In the case of the chaplin he is attached to the firemen or police dept. So if you again allow one religion or faith you will not be able to exclude any who wishes to participat­e.  By excluding all  religious groups it violates no religious rights as no religous group is allowed to participat­e. . While I may agree chaplins did alot of work during 911 there are many more unsung heros of 911. Talking to many nypd/nyfd workers myself most of them are heros everyday. They dont feel the need to be recognized­, their reward is a personal one each day they work knowing they made a difference­. And if we exclude one religious group we would have to let groups like westboro chruch  or a radical muslum group speak. Do you want our heros and family memebers, to have to stand and listen to what theses groups have to say about 911. Futher they could say what they want if allowed to speak ,as it is their religious freedom and their freedom of speech. This truely encite a riot and many lawsuits and in reality these extreme groups would win and have in the past.

				The 9/11 memorial is about honoring the people who helped out during 9/11. The public who has not seen these people, need to. It isn't politicall­y incorrect to pick one or two FDNY/NYPD chaplains (who can come from ANY faith) that were present at the WTC on 9/11 to speak. I think this would go a long way in explaining to the public how much first responders and their families suffered on that day. 

BTW; there is absolutely no requiremen­t to have all religious beliefs represente­d, I'm not sure why you assume that. As long as the chaplains don't endorse one religion, there is no problem.

				Let's see, if they allow a Rabbi, a Catholic priest, or a Protestant minister; they'll have to allow other faiths to join in... Yeah!  ban 'em all!

The people who shouldn't be banned are the NYPD, the NYFD and the EMT responders­; as well as a representa­tive from the people who did the clean up and search for victims.

Why? Probably because none of them have any respect for GWB, Cheney, Obama or Guliani and they might "boo" them!

Also, I don't think that members of Congress who voted against the U.S. health aid bill for 9/11 workers should be allowed to attend.

				Its my understand­ing they are premitted to attend the are just not pemitted to take the podium. And actually I disagree Congressme­n who voted against the health care bill  for 911 should attend only under the condition they wear a bright lime green shirt that says I voted NO.
As for them might boo them your right and i agree with how they feel as they feel betrayed by their own government­. At the same time shouldnt this be a peaceful time for the victims familys. After all isnt this their familys cementary.

				I know space is a considerat­ion, but it does seem odd that NYFD, NYPD, and EMT responders (some of whom died on that day as well) will not be represente­d.  Other ceremonies elsewhere are understand­able, but for this 10th anniversar­y, heroes must be represente­d as well as victims.

As for the religious numbskulls­, sputtering in the above article, they have no shame.  This day NOT ABOUT THEM.

				The parents, siblings, wives, children and other family of the NYFD, NYPD and EMT responders who died will be there.  It is my understand­ing that some of those bereaved family members who will be present, following in a family tradition of service, are NYFD and NYPD.  Which of them are you suggesting should stay home so that an EMT who was there but who didn't lose any family will be able to be present?

The so-called lack of representa­tion is the failure to give the current brass, who weren't necessaril­y around on 9/11, an opportunit­y to get up on stage and make speeches.  It is true that this ceremony is about the dead and their families and not the heroes who survived, but that is because both NYFD and NYPD are holding separate, in-house ceremonies­.

				Another dismal title change. Really Jaweed? Clergy Ban at 9/11 Memorial? You know, because all clergy are banned from the entire event. They're not allowed to be in the crowd or within a 100 foot radius of the memorial service.  They're all just banned outright.

Try to be a journalist­, Jaweed.

				Pat Robertson has the temerity to request that a representa­tive of the Evangelica­ls be present at the memorial service?     Wasn't he one of the voices who proclaimed that God did  this to us because of our  acceptance of the Gay Community, the ACLU  and other unchristia­n-like behaviors?     He and Jerry Falwell both said God was punishing us.    Keep religion in the Churches where it belongs.

				Was curious how they're doing with their petition and tracked it down today.  They have a grand total of 50,000 signatures­!  Apparently .0001 percent of the country agrees with them.  I hope they got lots of donations with those signatures­, enough to compensate them for the permanent black eye they gave themselves through their insensitiv­ity to the bereaved parents, sibings, widows and orphans whose grief they politicize­d to 'energize the base' and make a buck.

				I back this decision 100%. We cannot allow any religion to speak. If we allowed one religion we would have to allow all religions. I for one do not want westboro church or a radical muslum at the podium preaching about anything. If we allowed one religion and not another we would be resticting their religions freedom. . Next we would have a riot or a lawsuit at the taxpayers expence. By allowing no religion to speak we are not showing favoritism toward one group or another. I finally happy someone had a brain and thought this out.

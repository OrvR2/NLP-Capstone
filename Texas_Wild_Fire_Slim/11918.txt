Learning From Last Year's Disappointment


												Published 09/08/2011 - 10:30 a.m. CDT 
											














																"There was one thing that was the same this year and last year. I came out of the arena with tears in my eyes but this year, they were the good kind," Farris said. 
															

 Last November, I had the opportunity to show my
horse, Lyles Al Lie, at the World Show in Amateur
Hunter Under Saddle. If you are short on
time, or donât dwell on the past, I can quickly
summarize it for you--I choked in the
finals. After the finals in 2010, I vowed to
myself, my family that I would learn from that
experience.

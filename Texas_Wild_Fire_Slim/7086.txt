Second abused pit bull, Esperanza, making fast recovery




  
The pit bull found burned and near death in south Brazos County last month is a happy puppy by all accounts. 
But Vonn's history and what could set him off is a mystery. So caregivers enlisted Bonnie Beaver, a renowned Texas A&M animal behavior expert, to run temperament tests before adoption.
To gauge food possessiveness, Beaver set down a dish and scooped it up as he ate. Vonn wagged his long tail, unfazed.
Beaver then yanked a plush toy on a rope as Vonn pawed it. He gently snatched it and trotted off. He will chase critters, Beaver determined, but so will most dogs. 
In another test, Beaver made a striking motion toward Vonn with a red fly swatter. Vonn slightly recoiled, betraying fear but not aggression. 
A&M vets hail Vonn as a gentle dog, despite the brutality of his young life. He was found with ears cut off and skin falling off from burns -- likely caused by lighter fluid -- engulfing half his body. Death by infection loomed. 
But he made a spirited recovery at Texas A&M's College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. 
Now, on this picturesque afternoon, one test remained. 
Jimmy Barr, an A&M vet, doused a blue towel with lighter fluid. Beaver held the soaked towel as Vonn neared.
Painful memories
Imagine someone thrown into a terrorist prison in Afghanistan, said Beaver, a former president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. 
If confronted with a terrorist later, that person may react with two extremes: "Fly off the handle and attack with every ounce they have, or run and hide as fast as they could," Beaver said. 
It's the same with dogs, she said. 
Abused ones have a quick switch between a thinking brain and an emotional brain. Once a dog is running on emotion, it's too excited to listen to commands, and can cause damage. 
It's difficult to know exactly what cocktail of conditions could lead to a painful flashback. 
The tests Beaver ran can detect apparent trouble areas that could spark a fit of aggression, but they are not absolute. 
"All we can do is look and see if there is some obvious thing," Beaver said, "and we understand that we can't predict everything." 
Vonn is docile and playful. Part of that could be genetic, but the theory also is that he was snatched from a caring home and therefore knew love early before the trauma, Beaver said. 
Vonn remembers 
Beaver didn't take a chance. She held the blue towel with tongs. "The concern was he may lunge at me," she said. 
Beaver dangled the towel over Vonn's nose. The dog bowed his head and backed away several steps, sneaking glances at it.
"He remembers," Beaver said. 
Lighter fluid stinks, but dogs that dislike a smell usually crinkle their nose, Beaver said. Vonn's reaction instead was instinctive. 
"He wanted to get away," Beaver said. 
But Beaver was optimistic about Vonn's reaction: "He didn't panic." 
Care should be taken around Vonn in special circumstances, Beaver said -- for instance, around barbecues. The smell of lighter fluid could be that switch from a thinking dog to an emotional one. 
But ultimately, Beaver concluded, Vonn is clearly adoptable. 
"He seems like a really great little dog," she said. "He's got a chance to have a wonderful life." 
A new life
Chastity Rodgers is a one-dog-at-a-time person. 
Her hands were full with a 120-pound Great Dane named Keightley. 
But the day she read Vonn's story, Rodgers, the director of development and alumni relations for the vet school, wanted him.
"I've never seen an animal with such a will to live," she said. "To go through what he went through and to be optimistic about the future, it's really inspiring." 
For the first time, Rodgers has two dogs. 
Vonn will have a sprawling College Station backyard to frolic in, and he'll sleep in Rodgers' king-sized bed (he likes sleeping on his back with his paws shooting up). 
He'll also be sort of a mascot for the vet school.
Keightley is pouting a bit with Vonn getting a share of the attention that once was all his. Sometimes, when Vonn presses against the big dog in bed, Keightley turns his back to Vonn. Or if Vonn enters a room, Keightley walks out. 
But it's not all hurt feelings. Vonn brings out the playful side of the Great Dane. And Vonn, not a small dog himself at 38 pounds, loves zigzagging through the giant dog's legs. 
"I think they're going to be buddies," Rodgers said.

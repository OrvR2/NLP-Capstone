9/11 Gave Me a New Mission in Life: Winning the War on TerrorismBy Mathew PaulPostsWebsiteBy Mathew Paul | Yahoo! Contributor Network – 11 hrs ago






Yahoo! is asking Americans how September 11 changed them. Below is an account from a reader.


  At the time, I was working as a customer service representative for a major medical insurance company. This was a great change of pace for me. Previously, I was a Navy and then an Army civilian and part of the team that won the Cold War. I was part of the peace dividend as I lost my government job in early 1998, and the taxpayers no longer had to pay me. I did what every good civil servant should do -- I accomplished my mission and went home. Now instead of helping the nation prepare for war, I was helping the American people stay healthy.
  

  [Your story: How has September 11 changed you?]
  

  The attacks were brilliantly planned and well-executed, and the attackers displayed great bravery in dying for their cause. The enemy studied our airport security down to the smallest detail, and found a weakness in the system that no one in the Western world thought of. The attacks themselves were horrific and cruel. They deliberately targeted innocent civilians who were not given a fair chance to defend themselves, and had little to do with the Mideast.


  The soldiers in the Pentagon were working in offices and could not defend themselves as they never expected a civilian airliner to attack the Pentagon. We entered a new and dangerous chapter in modern warfare as innocent civilians replaced soldiers as the main targets. I knew the peace we had fought so hard to win was too good to be true and now it was gone and we had a new war to fight against a determined and tough enemy. This new war would be called the war on terrorism.
  

  The history of the war on terrorism confirmed my worldview. As a Navy and Army civilian, my main objective in life was to help the country prepare for war, win any potential war, and limit our casualties at the same time. Now that we had a new war to fight and win, I maintained that strategy and implement it in my writing career.


  I want to win the war on terrorism with as few casualties as possible. That is why I published the article, "Naval and Air Power Will Win the War on Terrorism." We can win the war on terrorism by using our advantages in naval and air power, combined with a limited role for our ground forces. I saw my strategy successfully play out in the real world. This is exactly the strategy the United States and its NATO allies used to win the conflict in Libya and overthrow Gadhafi and put the opposition in power. The United States and its NATO allies provided massive air support to the opposition, and very limited support from ground forces.
  

  Of course, I was against the war in Iraq as there was not sufficient provocation, and we relied on our ground forces and have suffered heavy casualties. We upset the fragile political culture in Iraq and now we cannot put the country back together, achieve stability and leave permanently.

2012 Presidential Hopefuls' Immigration Stances
 





Updated: 08/17/11



Iowa Caucuses:


Month
Feb


Day
06


Year
2012








 Oppose Amnesty/Legalization 

Long-term work permits and/or a path to citizenship should NOT be offered (whether through blanket amnesty or an “earned legalization” or other form) to millions of people who are illegally in the U.S.






 Mandate E-Verify 

Jobs held by illegal aliens SHOULD be opened up for unemployed Americans and legal immigrants already here by REQUIRING all businesses to use the Federal automated, rapid-response internet E-Verify system to screen out illegal foreign workers.






 Reduce Overall Immigration 

Overall immigration numbers each year SHOULD be reduced toward more traditional levels.  Average annual immigration was around 250,000 from 1776 to 1976, including the most recent part of that period after World War II.  But the current annual average of more than ONE MILLION since 1990 is too high. More than 38 million foreign workers and foreign-born dependents already live in the U.S.  At current rates, immigration will crowd another 100 million people into the U.S. in 50 years.  The government should stop forcing this rapid population expansion and its requirements of huge increases in energy, roads and other infrastructure and service.






 End Chain Migration 

Family-based immigration should be LIMITED to the nuclear family of spouse and minor children, as was the case during most of our history and as recommended by the bi-partisan, national Jordan Commission.  Allowed would be unlimited adoptions and marriages overseas, and liberal visitor visas for extended family. But eliminated would be the “chain migration” categories of permanent greencards for extended family that are the key reason immigration has quadrupled since the 1960s.






 End Visa Lottery 

The governmnet should STOP using a lottery to raffle off permanent work permits to 50,000 randomly chosen foreign citizens each year (an elimination suggested by the Jordan Commission).






 Limit Unfair Worker Competition 

The government should institute SAFEGUARDS that will prevent importation of foreign workers any time they would threaten the jobs or depress the wages of American workers.






 Secure Borders 

The government should fully FUND & IMPLEMENT border security measures already signed into law while finding creative ways to further protect U.S. property owners along the borders from crime and protect all Americans from terrorist and organized crime operations.






 Implement Entry/Exit 

The Administration should put into full operation the entry/exit system required by current law to monitor those who enter and leave our country, especially for the purposes of national security. 






 Support Local Enforcement 

The Administration should COOPERATE WITH & FACILITATE efforts by state and local governments to move unlawfully present foreign nationals from their communities in order to increase job opportunities for unemployed Americans and legal immigrants.






 Punish Business Violators 

The Administration SHOULD aggressively remove the economic incentives for employers to hire illegal foreign workers through means such as fines, tax policies and incarceration.






 Tackle Refugee Fraud
The “Temporary Protected Status” system should be reformed so that foreign nationals return to their homelands as soon as the temporary disaster/conflict has abated.  The number of permanent work permits/green cards issued each year should be limited to the U.S. fair share of refugees around the world who have been designated as requiring third-country re-settlement.





 End Birthright Citizenship
The United States should JOIN nearly all other advanced nations—and the majority of all nations—in ending the practice of granting citizenship to the births to illegal aliens, foreign students and tourists.  Our antiquated policy entices further illegal immigration and retards the decision of illegal aliens to go back home.



 

















Barack 
Obama
(DEM)





Abysmal


Pres. Obama has consistently throughout his presidency called for permanent work permits and a path to citizenship for nearly all illegal aliens in this country.

Click on photo for more information.







First Steps


Pres. Obama is trying to stop states from mandating E-Verify on their own. Nonetheless, he barely earns a First Steps rating because he issued an executive order in 2009 requiring all federal contractors and subcontractors to use E-Verify to keep from hiring illegal aliens, doubling the number of people being run through the system.

Click on photo for more information.







Unhelpful


President Obama has said nothing about the need to reduce overall immigration or to stop immigration from forcing massive new population growth and congestion.

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


President Obama supports "comprehensive immigration reform" bills (such as those of Rep. Luis Gutierrez and Sen. Robert Menendez) that not only protect Chain Migration categories but expand the numbers.

Click on photo for more information.







Unhelpful


President Obama has taken no actions, nor made any statements, regarding the visa lottery.

Click on photo for more information.







Abysmal


Pres. Obama's Administration has continued to issue permanent work permits (green cards) and temporary work visas during the Jobs Depression at about the same historic high rates that existed before. Each month, his Administration has flooded U.S. occupations with 75,000 new working age permanent immigrants, plus tens of thousands of temporary foreign workers, even as 22 million Americans who want a full-time job cannot find one. 

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


Pres. Obama has not acted to finish the Congressionally-mandated border fence and has sent only a token number of National Guardsmen and women to help secure the border. 

Click on photo for more information.







Abysmal


Even though current U.S. law requires the government to implement a biometric entry/exit system, Pres. Obama—like his two predecessors—has refused to do so. 

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


Pres. Obama's record is quite mixed. He deserves an Aybsmal rating for his Administration's agressive use of the courts to stop state and local efforts to help the feds enforce immigration law. And he has watered down the 287(g) program. Nonetheless, we give him "only" a Bad rating because he has at least has resisted strong lobbying from his political base to eliminate 287(g) and the Secure Communities programs.

Click on photo for more information.







Unhelpful


Pres. Obama has spoken numerous times about the need to punish those who knowingly hire illegal aliens, but has so far taken very few actions to punish violators.

Click on photo for more information.







Abysmal


Pres. Obama is as bad as Pres. Bush was in this category. He has repeatedly corrupted the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program by re-extending TPS to nationalities based on political appeals even though the crisis at home that warranted the status in the first place no longer exists.

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


The Obama Administration has not been much involved in the debate over giving U.S. citizenship to births of illegal aliens but has ridiculed the idea of ending it.

Obama
















Ron
Paul
(GOP)





Bad


Although Rep. Paul has always opposed amnesty, he also refuses to back enforcement measures that would lead to significant attrition of the illegal population. The effect of his positions is a de facto amnesty, and he recently has talked of the impossibility of handling most illegal aliens in any way but giving them some way to stay in the U.S. He tends to use the same language as the pro-amnesty lobbies who say the choise is between mass deportation or some sort of legalization.

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


Rep. Paul has never co-sponsored a bill mandating E-Verify. He philosophically opposes having businesses involved in keeping illegal foreign workers from getting jobs.

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


Rep. Paul has never indicated there is any problem with the federal government using immigration policy to drive the largest population explosion in U.S. history. He generally supports increasing immigration as high as businesses might want it to go, although he seems to prefer temporary over permanent immigration. But his actions in Congress tend to be less geared toward increasing immigration than his pronouncements, saving him from an Abysmal rating.

Click on photo for more information.







Unhelpful


Rep. Paul has not taken any actions to reduce non-nuclear family chain migration, although there have been bills he could co-sponsor every year.

Click on photo for more information.







First Steps


While Rep. Paul has not recently acted to end the visa lottery, he did support its elimination in 2004 and 2005.

Click on photo for more information.







Abysmal


Rep. Paul espouses a largely unfettered business philosophy of allowing employers to import far more foreign labor than they do now. And he does so even in the midst of 22 million Americans currently unable to find a full-time job.

Click on photo for more information.







First Steps


Rep. Paul talks about the need for border security and supports more Border Patrol and rights for border land owners to protect themselves. But he has consistently voted against other tougher measures to secure the border. His career record in Congress earns a C-minus on his NumbersUSA grade on Borders. Only one Republican in Congress has a worse grade.

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


Although several years ago he voted for an amendment that would have implemented the Entry/Exit system so that we can keep track of visitors, his new book expresses opposition to requring U.S. citizens to go through the same procedures when leaving and entering the country. But the only way to ensure that foreign citizens leave when they are supposed to -- and are entered into our system when they come into the country -- is to require all travelers to be checked in and out.

Click on photo for more information.







Unhelpful


In his 2011 book Liberty Defined, Rep. Paul expresses support for local enforcement of immigration laws while stopping short of supporting Arizona's interior enforcement law, SB 1070. He says, "permit states to enforce [immigration] laws" and "Arizona-type immigration legislation can turn out to be harmful. Being able to stop any American citizen under the vague charge of "suspicion" is dangerous." 

Click on photo for more information.







Abysmal


In his 2011 book Liberty Defined, Rep. Paul says we shouldn't "punish third parties for not being keen to act as law enforcement agents in regard to illegal immigration. Blaming American employers and fining them for hiring an individual, directly or indirectly, possibly with a counterfeit identification, strikes me as a compulsory servitude not permitted under the Constitution. Determining who is legal or not is a police and court function, not a responsibility of private business." 

Click on photo for more information.







Unhelpful


Rep. Paul has not taken any action regarding TPS or cracking down on refugee fraud.

Click on photo for more information.







Good


In his 2011 book Liberty Defined, Rep. Paul says the United States should "not grant automatic citizenship to children of illegal immigrants born in the United States, deliberately or accidentally."

Click on photo for more information.





Paul
















Gary 
Johnson
(GOP)





Abysmal


Gov. Gary Johnson is in favor of a legalization program for illegal aliens. In the Republican Presidential Debate on May 5, 2011, Gov. Johnson said: “With regard to the 11 million illegal immigrants that are in the country right now, I think we need to recognize that the government's the reason they're here illegally, they've made it impossible to get a work visa. So, set up grace period whereby those 11 million can get a work visa -- not citizenship, not a Green Card, but a work visa. Document those workers, so when it comes to building a fence across two-thousand miles of border, when it comes to putting the national guard arm-in-arm across two-thousand miles of border, in my opinion, that would be a whole lot of money spent with very little if any benefit whatsoever.”

Click on photo for more information.







Unhelpful


Gov. Johnson has not discussed mandating E-Verify.

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


In June 2010, Gov. Johnson released his 6-point immigration reform plan. In it he says: “Immigration into the United States by ambitious, willing workers and their families is a good thing. Not only is it a historical and energizing part of American culture and experience, it is vital to our economy. These positive benefits should not be sacrificed or reduced in any solution to stop illegal immigration.”

Unhelpful


Gov. Johnson has not discussed ending chain migration.

Unhelpful


Gov. Johnson has not discussed ending the visa lottery.

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


In the Republican Presidential Debate on May 5, 2011, Gov. Johnson said: “Well, first of all, I start with the premise that immigration is ultimately responsible for tens of millions of jobs, so creating tens of millions of jobs as opposed to taking away of jobs. I think we should make it as easy as possible to get a work visa. A work visa would not be citizenship, it wouldn't be a Green Card, but it would be a background check and a Social Security card so that applicable taxes would get paid. Immigration needs to be about work, not welfare.” 

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


In June 2010, Gov. Johnson released his 6-point immigration reform plan. In it he says:“In reality, true and cost-effective border security will only be achieved through a common sense combination of technology, a market-based guest worker program, and a safe, but efficient system for the legal flow of immigrants to and from the United States.” He also says we need to “Support current border deterrents and security measures, with an understanding of the low cost benefit analysis of these methods.”

Unhelpful


Gov. Johnson has not discussed implementing an entry/exit system. 

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


In June 2010, Gov. Johnson said: “Our current system needs to be repaired. The lack of Federal leadership on immigration has forced states like Arizona to take matters into their own hands. It is time to take a hard look at solving our immigration problems.” 

Click on photo for more information.







Good


In June 2010, Gov. Johnson released his 6-point immigration reform plan. In it he says the United States should: “Impose and enforce sanctions and fines for noncompliance with immigration laws by employers that are sufficiently costly, ensuring that the risks simply are not worth the rewards.”

Gov. Johnson has not discussed ending birthright citizenship.

Rick 
Santorum
(GOP)





Unhelpful


Sen. Santorum earned an A+ on stopping amnesties while in Congress. But recent comments to the media sound like he is leaning toward a "touchback" amnesty in which illegal aliens go back home and are quickly allowed to come back. 

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


Although Sen. Santorum has not recently commented on E-Verify, in 1996 he voted against creating even a voluntary E-Verify system. 

Click on photo for more information.







Abysmal


In a January 24, 2011, interview, Sen. Santorum said the United States needs to increase immigration: "I do think we need more people coming to this nation who want to be Americans to grow this economy. You want to fix the Social Security problem? Let's have more workers producing and helping out the situation.... For me, I'm willing to allow increased immigration to this country, which could hopefully create a path for people to come into this country the right way instead of having to come to this country the wrong way."

First Steps


During his time in the United States Senate, Sen Santorum had a decent record of voting against chain migration, earning a B grade. Since leaving the Senate, Sen. Santorum has made no public statements about this issue.

Bad


During his time in the United States Senate, Sen. Santorum twice voted in support of the visa lottery, earning an F- grade. Since leaving the Senate, Sen. Santorum has not discussed the visa lottery.

Abysmal


In a January 24, 2011 interview, Sen. Santorum said the United States needs more foreign workers: "I do think we need more people coming to this nation who want to be Americans to grow this economy. You want to fix the Social Security problem? Let's have more workers producing and helping out the situation.... For me, I'm willing to allow increased immigration to this country..."

Good


In a January 24, 2011 interview, Sen. Santorum said he would take whatever steps necessary to secure our border, using whatever physical, technological, and human resources are necessary. He misses an EXCELLENT rating because he doesn't provide enough specifics on how he would secure the border.

First Steps


Sen. Santorum in 2002 voted in favor of an entry/exit system. However, he has not addressed this issue since leaving the Senate.

Newt 
Gingrich
(GOP)





Excellent


On June 15, 2011, Rep. Gingrich sent out a Tweet supporting Sen. Grassley's mandatory E-Verify bill.

Unhelpful


Rep. Gingrich has not used his large national soap box to advocate for mandatory E-Verify and the elimination of the jobs magnet for illegal immigraiton. 

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


Rep. Gingrich has said nothing about the need to reduce overall immigration. His actions in Congress, however, greatly increased overall immigration numbers through creation of the visa lottery and increasing the number of employment-based green cards. Absent recent statements to the contrary, we have to assume his Bad record of actions indicate a Bad rating for his current stances.

Bad


While in Congress, Rep. Gingrich supported high levels of chain migration and opposed efforts to reduce it. He has said nothing to indicate a different current position.

Rep. Gingrich is a strong supporter of importing foreign workers, both temporary and permanent. And he has made statements in this regard during the current Jobs Depression.

Rick Perry
(GOP)





Unhelpful


Gov. Perry seems like he would like to be good on the amnesty issue but has failed to state a clear position covering the overall issue. Last year, he stated opposition to a president "unilaterally" legalizing illegal aliens but didn't comment on what Congress should do.  Earlier during the Bush Presidency, he gave mild support to the idea of legalization. And he recently renewed his support for in-state tuition for illegal aliens, which is a moderate form of amnesty.

Gov. Perry has not shown an empathy for unemployed Americans who must compete with an ever-growing number of foreign workers in their occupations.  Before the current Jobs Depression, he made a number of pronouncements about worker shortages and the need for more foreign workers.  He has failed since then to revise those opinions, leaving him just inside the Bad rating.

Gov. Perry has been a strong public advocate of much better border security. He would rate an "Excellent" if he were to offer a detailed plan of what he would do as President.

Good


Gov. Perry has been especially active in trying to stop city officials who refuse to obey federal immigration laws (as through Sanctuary City ordinances).  To rate an "Excellent," he needs to take a position on federal legislation that allows more local enforcement and on how he would change the way federal officials respond to state and local requests for more enforcement.

Mitt 
Romney
(GOP)





First Steps


While Gov. Romney has not spoken out recently about an amnesty or legalization for illegal aliens, he did oppose it during his 2008 Presidential campaign: “The wrong answer is amnesty. We tried it twice before. Amnesty only led to more people coming into the country 'cause they say, 'Oh gosh, look if you get in illegally, ultimately they'll let you stay.' That's the wrong message.” 

Click on photo for more information.







First Steps


While Gov. Romney has not spoken out recently about mandating E-Verify, he did support implementing some sort of mandatory employment verification system during his 2008 Presidential campaign: “The United States needs an employment-verification system that helps prevent illegal immigrants from getting jobs and punishes employers that knowingly hire them. That'll stop the flow of people into this country for work because they won't be able to get work.” 

Click on photo for more information.







Bad


Throughout his 2008 Presidential Campaign, Gov. Romney made it clear that he believed the United States needed more immigrants: “I like H1B visas. I like the idea of the best and brightest in the world coming here. I'd rather have them come here permanently rather than come and go, but I believe our visa program is designed to help us solve gaps in our employment pool. Where there are individuals who have skills that we do not have in abundance here, I'd like to bring them here and contribute to our economy. Ultimately we're in a competitive battle with the rest of the world; a battle where we need to stay the most powerful nation in the world. And the only way our nation stays ahead forever is with superior technology and innovation. And if we need additional folks who have skills that can contribute to our country then by all means lets welcome them in and if we see that our kids are not competing in certain areas lets help our kinds understand what they need to become competitive.”

First Steps

Your comments, additions & corrections: We want to hear from you, especially if you have links to media reports of immigration statements and positions that we don’t have.  Send them to:
            [email protected]

These are snapshots of views that are bound to change: We expect stances, our ratings of stances and the grades for these Presidential Hopefuls to change a great deal during 2011. We will re-evaluate every Hopeful and every position once every week. NumbersUSA expects that as American voters interact with the Hopefuls their immigration positions will improve.
Why these people? Their appearance here is based on the interest they have shown in potentially running for President, and in the interest that the news media has in them, plus their standing in preference polling. We will be adding other people to – and removing people from – the grid as these levels of interest shift.
Why these categories? The 12 categories on this grid deal with the vast majority of problems with current immigration policies that grant more than 1 million permanent work visas to immigrants each YEAR, and which allow an estimated 7 million jobs in construction, service, manufacturing and transportation to be filled by illegal foreign workers. These policies also drive the majority of additional demands on the physical, social and natural infrastructures of the country, since new immigrants and births to immigrants account for more than three-quarters of the 30 million additional people added to the U.S. population growth each decade. Most of the 12 categories were among the recommendations of the bi-partisan congressional/presidential commission chaired by Barbara Jordan.



What counts most in ratings? These are not Report Cards on past actions, which matter but not as much as what these politicians now say in the news media or on official websites. These grades and ratings are about what a Hopeful says a President should do about immigration.  We look at contradictions and changes in stances.  We generally give the most weight to the most recent statements and actions. To view the specific actions and statements of a candidate, click on his/her photo.
Why are we such tough graders? The ratings and grades reflect an urgency about the 22 million Americans who want a job but can't find one (the government's "U-6" unemployment category) and about the federal government continuing to force massive population growth while the nation is unable to meet its infrastructure and environmental goals with the current population size. Refusal to deal with a specific immigration category draws an "Unhelpful" rating. Merely avoiding "bad" immigration positions and drawing an “Unhelpful” in all the categories will result in a “D-minus” grade.





Other Potential Candidates:

These politicians don't meet the overall criteria for "major presidential hopeful" to appear at the top of this page.  But they are people of considerable public interest in relation to the national race.







 Oppose Amnesty/Legalization 

Long-term work permits and/or a path to citizenship should NOT be offered (whether through blanket amnesty or an “earned legalization” or other form) to millions of people who are illegally in the U.S.






 Mandate E-Verify 

Jobs held by illegal aliens SHOULD be opened up for unemployed Americans and legal immigrants already here by REQUIRING all businesses to use the Federal automated, rapid-response internet E-Verify system to screen out illegal foreign workers.






 Reduce Overall Immigration 

Overall immigration numbers each year SHOULD be reduced toward more traditional levels.  Average annual immigration was around 250,000 from 1776 to 1976, including the most recent part of that period after World War II.  But the current annual average of more than ONE MILLION since 1990 is too high. More than 38 million foreign workers and foreign-born dependents already live in the U.S.  At current rates, immigration will crowd another 100 million people into the U.S. in 50 years.  The government should stop forcing this rapid population expansion and its requirements of huge increases in energy, roads and other infrastructure and service.






 End Chain Migration 

Family-based immigration should be LIMITED to the nuclear family of spouse and minor children, as was the case during most of our history and as recommended by the bi-partisan, national Jordan Commission.  Allowed would be unlimited adoptions and marriages overseas, and liberal visitor visas for extended family. But eliminated would be the “chain migration” categories of permanent greencards for extended family that are the key reason immigration has quadrupled since the 1960s.






 End Visa Lottery 

The governmnet should STOP using a lottery to raffle off permanent work permits to 50,000 randomly chosen foreign citizens each year (an elimination suggested by the Jordan Commission).






 Limit Unfair Worker Competition 

The government should institute SAFEGUARDS that will prevent importation of foreign workers any time they would threaten the jobs or depress the wages of American workers.






 Secure Borders 

The government should fully FUND & IMPLEMENT border security measures already signed into law while finding creative ways to further protect U.S. property owners along the borders from crime and protect all Americans from terrorist and organized crime operations.






 Implement Entry/Exit 

The Administration should put into full operation the entry/exit system required by current law to monitor those who enter and leave our country, especially for the purposes of national security. 






 Support Local Enforcement 

The Administration should COOPERATE WITH & FACILITATE efforts by state and local governments to move unlawfully present foreign nationals from their communities in order to increase job opportunities for unemployed Americans and legal immigrants.






 Punish Business Violators 

The Administration SHOULD aggressively remove the economic incentives for employers to hire illegal foreign workers through means such as fines, tax policies and incarceration.






 Tackle Refugee Fraud
The “Temporary Protected Status” system should be reformed so that foreign nationals return to their homelands as soon as the temporary disaster/conflict has abated.  The number of permanent work permits/green cards issued each year should be limited to the U.S. fair share of refugees around the world who have been designated as requiring third-country re-settlement.





 End Birthright Citizenship
The United States should JOIN nearly all other advanced nations—and the majority of all nations—in ending the practice of granting citizenship to the births to illegal aliens, foreign students and tourists.  Our antiquated policy entices further illegal immigration and retards the decision of illegal aliens to go back home.

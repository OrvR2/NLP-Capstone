Lows relative humidities of 10 to 20 percent can be expected over all west Texas with low RH’s of 5 to 10 percent around Fort Stockton, San Angelo and Midland areas. The strongest winds will be over the panhandle and sections of Northwest and West Branch along and to the north of Interstate 20. High temperatures will range in the 80s and 90s, except for some upper 70s in the northern panhandle. Poor overnight recoveries are expected for areas away from the coast.

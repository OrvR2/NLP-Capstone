Since fire season began on Nov. 15, Texas Forest Service and area fire departments have responded to more than 10,000 fires that have charred 2.7 million acres. More than 80 percent of wildfires occur within 2 miles of a community. The two-day class is designed for fire department staff, fire marshals, city and county emergency management officials and planning staff, mayors and city managers, county judges, commissioners, community and civic leaders and mitigation planners. “We’ve seen fires literally burn across the entire state of Texas this year,” said Wildland Urban Interface Forester Nick Harrison. “When a fire strikes, we want communities to be as resilient as possible. This summit will give community leaders the tools to make that happen.”Although the event is free, registration is required. Download a registration form here.

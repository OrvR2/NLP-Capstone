Plan B on Palestine at the UN? Europeans mull alternative resolutionBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Fri, Sep 2, 2011

Pres. Obama, Israeli PM Netanyahu, left, and Palestinian Pres. Mahmoud Abbas meet at the UN Sept. 22, 2009. (Charles …
As President Barack Obama prepares to address the United Nations later this month, a painful diplomatic failure of his administration looms: last year, speaking to the same UN General Assembly opening session, Obama voiced the hope that US-led diplomatic efforts would help achieve a negotiated agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians that would lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state this fall.
"Each of us must choose the path of peace," Obama told world diplomats gathered in New York last September. "If we do, when we come back here next year, we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the United Nations — an independent, sovereign state of Palestine, living in peace with Israel."
As that deadline fast approaches, however -- Obama is set to address the UN General Assembly on September 20th, the White House said Thursday--the vision seems further away from reality than ever. Israelis and Palestinians have not even been at the negotiating table for eleven months. Meantime, the Arab spring uprisings have re-scrambled the political order of the Arab world, toppling early on a key Arab pillar of the peace process, Egypt's Hosni Mubarak.
Amid the ongoing tumult, Israelis have grown increasingly risk averse about their restive neighborhood. Meantime, the Palestinians, having lost confidence in Washington's peacemaking abilities, have vowed to go to the United Nations and seek unilateral statehood recognition this month, bypassing a negotiated agreement with Israel, against the strenuous objections of Washington and Israel.
Watching it all with growing unease are the Europeans, who have generally been relegated to a backseat role by Washington on Mideast peacemaking. But now, some diplomatic observers suggest that the Europeans may offer a way to avert a potential disaster on the issue: by introducing an alternative UN resolution that would recognize both Israel and a Palestinian state, living side by side, in peace, and calling for renewed negotiations.
Such diplomatic discussions are in their early stages and sensitive, given several factors. Among them: the Europeans have not yet arrived at a unified position on the issue among their 27-nation bloc; Palestinian plans are still in disarray; and because the Obama administration's public position--reflecting Jerusalem's--remains to adamantly reject that any sort of Palestinian statehood resolution should proceed at the United Nations at all.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy went public this week with his discomfort at European divisions on the matter, and voiced growing conviction that Washington is unable to lead Mideast peacemaking efforts on its own:
"The 27 countries of the European Union must express themselves with one  voice," Sarkozy said in a speech Wednesday to French ambassadors, Reuters reported. "The role of the U.S. is uncontested and  irreplaceable, but everybody sees that it is not enough. We have to  widen the circle of negotiation, think of the role and pertinence of the  quartet."
European nation foreign ministry lawyers are studying language that might be used in an alternative resolution on Palestinian statehood, a European diplomat told the Envoy Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic discussions.
"I know lawyers are looking at how to make this acceptable for everyone," the diplomat said. "The matter for us is, if we want to have leverage, we have to be united. That affects how far you can go in drafting something. It's important when the text is negotiated, that it would call for  both sides to agree" on the terms for establishing two states.
The diplomat suggested that UK foreign office lawyers in London may be taking the lead in drafting alternative resolution language, although the diplomat stressed that the work was still in its early stages and there had not been a policy decision on whether to introduce it.
U.S. diplomats declined to discuss the matter, describing any European alternative resolution planning as "vague talk" and "chatter."
"As we move closer to the middle of September, we are very much aware of the situation and we're talking with our close allies and partners about it," State Department spokesman Mark Toner told journalists at the State Department Thursday when asked about the looming Palestinian UN September bid. "Our position couldn't be clearer publicly or privately."
Despite the administration's uncomfortable reticence on the matter, some Washington Middle East analysts in consultation with the administration said an alternative resolution may be the least bad of several potential outcomes.
"I think it's the best bet and the main hope for avoiding some kind of confrontation that would be very detrimental to all parties," said Hussein Ibish, a Middle East analyst with the American Task Force for Palestine, in an interview with the Envoy Friday. "If the Europeans can craft language with the Palestinians" for an alternative resolution, he continued, it might help provide a "soft landing, so that whatever happens in September, funding is not cut for Palestinian state-building and Israeli-Palestinian security coordination."
"A soft landing depends on the perception of [Palestinian] quality of life the day after whatever happens," Ibish added.
Even some Israeli lawmakers suggest an alternative European resolution on the matter might be helpful if the Palestinians can't be persuaded to abandon their UN bid.
"It could be a good idea if it helps the Palestinian leadership find some alternative wording … that does not mention specific borders and calls upon the sides [to go into] direction negotiations," said Israeli Knesset member Einat Wilf, in an interview with the Envoy Tuesday.
But Wilf rejected the Palestinians' UN gambit for trying to "draw the international community deeper into the conflict," she added.
"An alternative resolution may be attractive, if it calls for the basic parameters for negotiations, and doesn't foreclose negotiations," said Scott Lasensky, a Middle East expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace, in an interview with the Envoy Thursday.
"As time goes on, [the Palestinian UN matter] looks increasingly like a sideshow," Lasensky added. "Other events in the region"--Syrian unrest, the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya, the increased terrorist threat to southern Israel coming via Egypt's Sinai and Egypt's upcoming elections-- "increasingly command attention. The showdown at the UN may turn out be anticlimactic."

Israel was a fool to ever consider a terrorist group like the PLO to be likely candidates for a peace process whereby Israel gives up some if its land to these blood sucking maggot parasite squatters.

Think of it like this:  Zionists and Communism won WWII.  The U.N was formed by the winners of WWII.  Thus the U.N. is Zionist.  No wonder it never punishes Israel for anything, and really stand up for the Palestinian People's rights (which were not to be abused according to Balflour Declaration.

Here is the ultimate peace plan... which neither side or any involved is ADULT enough to do.
In the words of Jesus.... FORGIVE.  You only have one life on earth. No one can change the
past. You might as well enjoy your life instead of getting caught up in silly politics and religious
hate.  Can any of you put the Temple Mount in your pocket? NO. Can any of you slide the borders of Jerusalem under your bed? NO. So why fight over what you can never have?  
The answer is forgive and forget about borders. ENJOY YOUR LIFE. BE HAPPY. MAKE THE BEST OUT OF LIFE. You want borders? Mind your own business and be a good neighbor. Thats all the borders we need.

Hi Jerry, Im not trying to call you out, just want to get your attention..ok. I have been a
subscriber to a biblical archaeology  magazine for over a year. I keep up with ancient findings
and articles from various sources as well. These articles and artifacts do not have any particular agenda, they do not claim a particular faith, but show artifacts from that time period, 
research and carbon dating. Even today the news on Yahoo tells of an ossurary of
Caiaphas with scientific evidence that it is legit. How do you explain the thousands of
artifacts, recently unearthed buildings such as Bethesda,The Wall, and even the
 Dead sea scrolls when you claim there is no David. Researchers found an inscription
referring to King David in Israel dated from the 9th century BCE. Are all these people lying?
 Are you implying all of this is fake? Again, Im not trying to be rude,
I just want to hear your opinion as to where did these thousands of items and buildings
come from? And why would many peoples of many faiths report on various findings
including palestinian artifacts? How do you fake an entire country? For what?

The PLA recognized Israel's right to exist back in 1993.  Israel began to give back all the land it had occupied since 67 as according to the Oslo Peace Agreement.  Massive protests of Jewish people began against giving up settlements, violence against Palestinians begat violence against Israelies, and then Prime Minister Rabin who pushed for the peace process received three bullets in the chest.

Then the Netenyahu era started and he has been in power for the last fourteen years.  He started off decrying that the PLA wasn't doing enough to stop terrorism (never mind the Israel attacks on Palestinians for land that the Israelies where forced by Israelie soldiers to give up) so he began massive arrests on Palestinians and and laid siege to the interm government under Arafat thirteen years ago. Since then Gaza and the West Bank have been locked down from the outside world.

They could have had a state decades ago if they had given up on murder and hatred and accepted israels right to exist. Remember 3 wars brought by arab nations to destroy israel-and they would use the same tactics as the man they admire  -hitler. The grand mufti of palestine was a nazi during ww2. Hamas is a terrorist extremist muslim organization that wants israels destruction and an iranian style regime. For god's sake the muslims and arabs' can't even live in peace with each other-they kill their own children. When the palestinians love of their own children is greater than their hatred of the jews-then there will be peace.

There was no kingdom of Israel as described in the Bible.   Israel was a made up kingdom to promote the priest class of Jerusalem over the other two temples in Samaria. King David and King Solomon never existed.  Palestine was the name given to the prominate sea people that settled there, the Phaleaphapas who emigrated from Cyrpus.  Of course in the Semetic tounge the Greek "PH" is prounounced as an "F" so the bible calls them Phillistines.  But everybody else from the Syrians, the Persians, Greeks and Egyptians called them Palestinians.  This has been documented in history since the 8th century.  Whereas, if it wasn't for the Bible we would have never have heard of an "Israel".

The UN idea is pointless for the Palestinians anways because the UN has already approved the boundaries since 1947 and while Jordan and Egypt violated them until 1967, the Israelis have been violating them since then.  Pretending this resolutions dont matter or are irrelevent now because Israel has built for decades on the best of the land in question, seized as a buffer the entire Jordan valley, and will never relinquish border control, air and sea control, and water access does not mean these resolutions at the UN were never passed!  They were just never respected.  Fact of the matter is that if a Martian came down to earth he would tell you that the people who occupy the land own it.  As long as Jews prefer to live in NY, London, or Paris instead of Jerusalem, Haiffa, or Tel Aviv the idea of recreating a Jewish majority on that land will always be in peril and at the mercy of western aid and Arab disunity.  It also means that however you slice it...policies that alter demographics systematically are a crime against humanity as stated in the Nuremburg trials.  If Saddam or Milosevic cannot change natural demographics neither should Israel.

Please tell me why the world needs a 58th Islamic Republic and why it needs to be built on the back of Israel?  The Turks controlled the area for 100 years but never gave the Palis a state.  I wonder why??  because they never EXISTED!    If the Palis want a homeland they have it, its called JORDAN

Back in the 1920s when the jews were considering buying part of Brazil... was that supposed to be god's land. What great marketing to tell they whole world that Israel is for the Jews because god said so. The Zionists and European Jews were persecuted by all of Europe, and now they justify their persecution of the poor Palestinians by looking back to Nazi Germany. The bitter irony. You figure the jews would have learned.

Kid Rock feeling optimistic about Detroit footballBy NEKESA MUMBI MOODY - AP Music Writer | AP – 9 hrs ago

NEW YORK (AP) — Kid Rock will be celebrating the kickoff of the National Football League season with a concert at Lambeau Field, but his thoughts are with his hometown Detroit Lions."I think the Lions are going to win nine or 10 games," Kid Rock said by phone this week. "They really have turned it around. ... It's been a long time coming here in Detroit."The Lions haven't had a winning season since 2000. Last year they won six of their 16 games, which was four more than they won in 2009 — and six more than in 2008.Kid Rock, who's known for dabbling in musical styles from hip-hop and hard rock to country and Southern rock, said in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday that it's been tough being a football fan in Detroit ever since he can remember. But it helps ease the pain to be a fan of more than one football team, so Kid Rock has adopted the Green Bay Packers as one of his teams.On Thursday, Kid Rock will join Lady Antebellum and Maroon 5 for a concert at Lambeau Field, the home of the Packers, in Green Bay, Wis., where the Super Bowl champions will play the New Orleans Saints in the inaugural game of the NFL season.Kid Rock, whose hits include "Bawitdaba" and "Cowboy," said he expects an energetic crowd for the season opener, which will air on NBC."I've been to a playoff game in Lambeau Field, so I know their level of intensity," he said.Kid Rock is a sports fan, but he's more partial to football: He was born on Super Bowl Sunday, in 1971, when the Baltimore Colts beat the Dallas Cowboys in Miami.Still, he had a backup plan if the NFL work stoppage had scuttled the season: "Just watch NASCAR."___Online:http://www.nfl.comhttp://www.kidrock.com___Nekesa Mumbi Moody is the AP's music editor.

If he is a fan in any way of the Packers, he is no true Lions fan.

Cowboy and that Bawadababada song are cool but he ruined that Skynyrd song and the rest of his stuff is mediocre at best.

"Who cares about Kid Rock and what he thinks about football!!!", but the world should care what a bunch of loudmouths think about him, huh??? Interesting.

P.S. When someone picks their name at the start of a music career, they're probably not thinking how silly it will sound when they turn 40, so relax about it. Oh yeah, I am from Michigan, too. Go Lions!!! Go Kid!!! ;-)

He is a great person for supporting his home town.  I am a SAINTS fan and the WHO DAT NATION knows what it is like to be down and out, but we love NOLA as he loves his home town. Most of us love where we are from and need to be thankfull that we are ALL part of the GREAT USA!!! Remember football is football, but our great nation gives us the right to pull for the team we love!!!

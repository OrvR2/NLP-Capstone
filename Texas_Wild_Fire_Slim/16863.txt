		Severe weather can strike with little or no warning. WeatherBug Protect turns your
		mobile device into a potential life-saving alerting system by delivering precise,
		local weather alerts before severe weather becomes a threat. WeatherBug Protect
		is a location-based mobile solution that proactively alerts end users when severe
		weather threats are detected or predefined weather thresholds (customized by the
		user) are exceeded within their proximity.
	

		Protect integrates data from the National Weather Service (NWS) along with data
		from the WeatherBug network – the only source for truly live, local weather – providing
		users access to the largest network of professional weather stations in the US and
		thousands of locations around the world. The system continuously monitors potentially
		threatening weather conditions, analyzes weather alerts and approaching storms within
		a designated range each end user's specific location and then formats and delivers
		the appropriate alert message based on the user’s weather profile and mobile device.

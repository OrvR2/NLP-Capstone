How do you feel about the new federal requirement that insurances provide birth control with no copay?
WASHINGTON (AP) — A half-century after the advent of the pill, the Obama administration on Monday ushered in a change in women's health care potentially as transformative: coverage of birth control as prevention, with no copays.

Services ranging from breast pumps for new mothers to counseling on domestic violence were also included in the broad expansion of women's preventive care under President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.

Since birth control is the most common drug prescribed to women, health plans should make sure it's readily available, said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. "Not doing it would be like not covering flu shots," she said.

Officials said the women's prevention package will be available Jan. 1, 2013, although health insurance providers indicate the change will result in overall increases in premiums.
Tens of millions of women are expected to benefit initially, a number that is likely to grow with time. At first, some plans may be exempt due to an arcane provision of the health care law known as the "grandfather" clause. But those plans could face pressure from their members to include the new coverage.

Social and religious and religious conservatives objected to the birth control mandate, saying a conscience exception unveiled by the administration is insufficient.

Some public health experts predicted the change will promote the use of costlier long-acting contraceptives, such as hormonal implants. More reliable than the pill, they are gaining popularity in other economically advanced countries.

As recently as the 1990s, many health insurance plans didn't even cover birth control. Protests, court cases, and new state laws led to dramatic changes. Today, almost all plans cover prescription contraceptives — with varying copays. Medicaid, the health care program for low-income people, also covers birth control.

A government study last summer found that birth control use is virtually universal in the United States. Still, about half of all pregnancies are unplanned. Many are among women using some form of contraception, and forgetting to take the pill is a major reason.

Some research has shown that even modest copays for medical care can discourage use.

In a nod to social and religious conservatives, the rules issued Monday by Sebelius include a provision that would allow religious institutions to opt out of offering birth control coverage.

Let's see, $30 per month in birth control, vs:

1 woman and 1 child on cash assistance:
225/mo X 12 months = 2700/year

1 woman and 1 child on food stamps (with above cash assistance as only income):

367/mo X 12 = 4404/year

1 woman and 1 child on rental assistance (Housing) - using a baseline approx figure:

450/mo X 12 months = 5400/year

Let's not even INCLUDE Medicaid in this (to pay for the birth/hospital stay/well child checkups, etc).

So far, that is 12,504 for a year of support for 1 woman and 1 child.

Or, we give her free birth control at about 30/mo, and that's 360 a YEAR.

So, gov't interference is bad here?  Wow.  We would RATHER the gov't stay out of it and pay over 12,000 a year, vs less than 500?  

Well, if you like it hell I love it then.

Just another way the government is trying to run everyone's life.  This is none of the government's business, so keep your nose out of my business.

Government should offer free birth control, free tubal ligation, and free vasectomy services to anyone who lives here, regardless of their legal status. Do the cost benefit analysis. A plan like this would save taxpayers billions in the long run. Many of the tea party types can't see the forest for the trees.

I've come to the conclusion that the best birth control, free or otherwise, is.....same sex marriage.

Susan, make no mistake, there is nothing FREE about this. The companies, being for-profit companies, will figure out a way to charge you and me for it. They aren't being ordered to do anything free of charge and will make it up in higher premiums.

I believe the issue here is not about sex, or birth control methods.  The issue is whether it is right for the government to dictate to a group of businesses (insurance) that they have to provide FREE coverage.  
There are some wellness screenings that most insurance policies cover now,but this has nothing to do with prevention of disease. 
To have insurance policies have birth control as a covered expense (with copays, whatever) is useful, but for the government to dictate that it must be included and for free is government at its worst!

In the end, having sex is a choice, not a medical condition and as such, I'm perplexed why the folks involved in that decision shouldn't have to pay the entire cost for birth control.

As a woman, the argument against "if you want to play you have to pay" is silly, though it shouldn't be used just when it comes to sex, or fall only on the woman. Life is full of risk. If you drive fast and get a speeding ticket, or end up in an accident, should it be you or me that pays your higher insurance premium? If you break some ribs in a mountain biking race, should you or I have to pay your hospital bill?

Birth control is an insurance policy and as such, the people involved should have to pay for it.

So, Kyle, as a man, I guess every single time you have ever had sex you were fully prepared for that to result in a baby?  Come on, people, let's stop acting like women aren't allowed to have sex.  Let's stop treating babies as punishment to women for daring to enjoy sex.  Funny, it's always men who have this "well, you want to play you have to pay!" attitude.  And most single parents are women because men have the option of just taking off.  This is a step in the right direction.

It should have been a given for years.

However, if sex education would have been as prevalent as the pill and the urge to have sex it would probably have been a moot point.

And are the poor going to have access to it?

It sounds difficult to hear, but if you are going listen to the piper you'd better be ready to pay him.  I'm a helpful man, but this is government interference at its worst.  We need new leaders, or we will keep rolling down down down hill...<><

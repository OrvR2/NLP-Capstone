The same groups that President Kennedy spoke of.  He refered to them as "repugnant"...and "secret societies that control our governent".  He vowed to expose them and ten days later was shot.

Most Americans who have spent even ten minutes looking beyond the mainstream media have seen that 911 is so full of lies.  The story of terrorists completely fabricated.  It is convoluted, but not that hard to figure out.

Another year gone by, the real perpetrators remain invisible.  I do hope and pray that one day I see headlines in their own mainstream media, exposing them.  I hope and pray for justice and to see those responsible for 911 prosecuted.

You need protect yourselves as the Government cannot till after a tragedy happens.Police cannot arrest till a crime has been commited. or a threat if witnessed by them.God has blessed us with a white Christian centered society ,,,where we have peace thru generations of Veterans,,,,,illegals and immigrants seek our society ,,,meld in or leave,,,you are not welcomed if you are a criminal and or have hatred tward american Christian values.Get the hell out of the BEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND !!!

My Holy Father shall NEVER forgive the bully nation America for pulling this childish stunt on its own self.  And all this hell just to justify more rally 'round the flag hell and more war just to satisfy the industrial/military complex.

My Father is very angry!

I pray that we don't forget the lessons of September 11th. Only the first is that uncontroled  evil manifesting itself as hate clokeing itself in religion will explode and kill inocents; we cannot allow evil to hide or cloke itself. We cannot fight evil with evil; when you do, evil wins. We learned that tomorrow is never promised, and only today do you have the chance to tell those that we love how you feel. We learned that people can give to their fellow man, and can give everything that they have to give (flight 93) and we all have the capacity to give or not, and not leaves us lesser, it is better to give, and make ourselves greater. Yes everyday remember the lessons, hold those that you love a little longer because that may be your last chance. We cannot allow evil to prevail and we will not embrace evil to do it. We have the capacity to give more than we ever thought we could.  We will honor our God.

I’m tired of the hype that the media and Hollywood have stirred up over 911. The people in the trade center building were not hero’s or sacrifices; they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. And the families of these victims have made more money than they could have ever done on their own. We should be giving our money to the real hero’s, the American Military.

My best friend ,she just has announced her wedding with a millionaire man! They met via SearchⱤichṢingles.CȯṀ ..it is the largest and best club for millionaires and their admirers to chat online. …You do not have to be rich or famous, but you may meet one. It's worth a try!

It's real simple, Tim.   You will not be the next great QB in the NFL, I guarantee it.   Your too soft.   This is not the college ranks.   You will be good, but not that good to carry the Bronco's the the championship.   Thank, Elway for the drama and splitting up the team.   Vick, will fail also.   The other QB, Orton is a bum too, so no worries.   third place you go.

@ Jinx-
 I was 9 on 9/11/01, and I lived on Guam at the time. Maybe it's just because I'm a military kid, or my AIR FORCE daddy raised me right, but I totally agree. The ceremonies and memorial services yesterday were not about the media, and whatever people on here are saying. It was about stepping back and remembering the lives that were stolen on that day, and to support the families that lost loved ones...to the children that lost Mommy, or Daddy...
 Forget the stupid conspiracy theories...
 Too bad we can't ban ignorance, huh? 
I'm glad to see comments like yours. 
...As for the people that call themselves AMERICANS, but have only negative things to say about the country that gives you the right to live life as idiots...Shape up, or ship out! If you don't appreciate what you've got...give it up for someone that would give all to live the lives you live...

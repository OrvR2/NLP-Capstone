UFC 141: Brock Lesnar Vs. Alistair Overeem Betting Odds

Mike Fagan over at Bloody Elbow (who is an excellent MMA handicapper) already has the betting odds posted for Brock Lesnar vs. Alistair Overeem:The fight announcement is hardly an hour old, and Bodog already has a line up for the December 30 clash between former UFC champion Brock Lesnar and former Strikeforce champion Alistair Overeem. Bodog has Lesnar and Overeem as a pick'em, and you'll need to lay -115 on either side to account for the vig.Given concerns about how Lesnar reacts to getting punched in the face, I expect the early action to come in on Overeem.Given the skill disparity in terms of the dimensions of the game (Overeem standing, Brock controlling on the floor), I find the notion of betting on either man to be deeply problematic. Both carry such strong skills and liabilities, betting is ultra risky here.

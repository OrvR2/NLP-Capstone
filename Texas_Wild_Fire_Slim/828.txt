Texas Senator Dan Patrick FoxNews Interview

Order: Reorder
Duration: 5:04
Published: 2009-02-23
Author: Zen5012


Texas Senator Dan Patrick announces that Texas has placed its National Guard on "High Alert" - The first time in Modern History, due to the Civil War breaking out in Mexico. Texas has received NO response from the Federal Government to its repeated requests for help. If the National Guard is forced to take defensive action against a Foreign Nation without the approval of the Federal Government, Texas will be breaking Federal Law. WHY DOESN'T THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MATCH ITS CLAIMS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACT? This video is not posted, referenced or mentioned on FoxNews' website or any other major media outlet. It has been announced on several independent sites, first on patriotsforamerica.ning.com then the video finally got posted on www.xomba.com and most didn't believe it. Seems like we talk a lot about not trusting the Mainstream Media but still can't take those claims all the way.

[Federal agencies seize control on Tuesday] Hundreds of firefighters from all the surrounding counties worked two days and nights in a heroic effort to contain the fires, but high winds Sunday night and all day Monday thwarted their efforts. So the call went out for more volunteer firefighters to join the effort from across the state. Before they arrived, however, the federal government showed up and claimed it was in charge of the situation. "Agents with the federal National Interagency Fire Center, a coalition of federal agencies including the US Forest Service, assumed command of firefighting efforts Tuesday afternoon," reports The Gonzales Cannon (www.gonzalescannon.com RealNewsReporter.com is now reporting that volunteer firefighters who had in some cases driven all night to reach Bastrop county were turned away by the feds, who claimed that since local officials never made a "formal request" for volunteers, the volunteers could not be "activated." So while Bastrop County burns from 40+ fires that are still raging, the federal government is actually telling volunteer firefighters to go home. "We were at the station getting set up into strike teams, and this guy came up and said that the US Forest Service had 'assumed control of the situation, and that If you don't have a vehicle that squirts water, go home,' said Gordon Greer of Kirbyville, in a RealNewsReporter article (www.realnewsreporter.com Gordon reportedly drove all night Monday to arrive in Bastrop and take <b>...</b>

Rick Perry is just mad as hell about how he is being forced to spend billions of dollar in federal stimulus money in ways the federal government demands.

Author: minnesotachris


house.gov CampaignForLiberty.com Last week I had the opportunity to bring up spending and transparency in two important hearings. On Wednesday I questioned Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on some highly questionable uses of funds at the Federal Reserve, and on Thursday I asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about exorbitant spending at the State Department. It is extremely important to continue bringing these issues up, especially in light of our difficult economic times, when so many are out of work, as I saw up close in my district at the Oceans of Opportunity Job Fair in Galveston two weeks ago. Those who are working live with the fear of losing their jobs as they struggle to pay bills. Meanwhile, Washington is talking of increasing their taxes, something voters were promised, clearly and adamantly, would not happen in this administration. Government also struggles with money, but the struggle centers on how to get more of your money into government coffers. Rather than expanding the Federal budget in the face of economic downturn, we should be focusing on eliminating waste and being the very best stewards of public funds that we can possibly be. Most businesses have had to streamline and cut back in order to survive, and so it is only fair for our government to do the same. Instead, the State Department is building a $1 billion embassy in London, the most expensive ever built. The plans even include surrounding it with a moat! I asked the Secretary of State <b>...</b>

Alex Jones Calls Texas Senators Cowards At Texas Capitol For Caving To Fed TSA Threats

Order: Reorder

Author: MikeHansonArchives


AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A bill that would prohibit federal agents from intrusive searches during airport security pat downs is likely dead in the Texas Senate after a threat from federal officials to close airports if the measure passed. The bill sponsor blamed Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst for turning senators against his bill Tuesday night. Republican Sen. Dan Patrick said he lost votes to bring the bill to the floor for a debate because Dewhurst caved to pressure from the federal government. The measure, already approved by the House, would make it illegal for anyone conducting searches to touch private parts under or through clothing. It also prohibits searches "that would be offensive to a reasonable person." Patrick said he doesn't have the support to bring the bill up again for a vote. Protestors gathered in the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon and angrily chanted at lawmakers after the bill was killed. Read more: www.myfoxaustin.com

Ron Paul's Texas Straight Talk 4/18/11: Budget Cuts are Meaningless Without Fed Transparency

Order: Reorder
Duration: 4:45
Published: 2011-04-18
Author: minnesotachris


paul.house.gov http Congress focused on issues surrounding government spending this week as talk of deficits, the national debt, and the debt limit saturated the airwaves. This is a positive development. In years past, there was very little concern over how much was spent here in Washington, how it was spent, or how much of our gross domestic product was being consumed by government. That blissful ignorance naturally resulted in decades of government spending with impunity, bringing us to where we are today: trillions in debt with astronomical entitlement obligations that will be impossible to fulfill in the not too distant future. So it is a good thing that there is so much political pressure now on our leaders to actually put the brakes on runaway spending. However, even the most generous estimate of the spending cut passed this week -- $38.5 billion -- is a paltry 3.5% of the $1.05 trillion in spending through the next 5 months. This hardly makes a dent in our government's mountain of debt. Even worse than that, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) stripped away the accounting sleights of hand and scored it as only $352 million in cuts, which works out to less than half of one percent of spending. Still, the tiniest cut is better than the massive increases we have become accustomed to in federal budgets. Of course, our disastrous wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are not even included in this budget as they are considered emergency spending. They constitute <b>...</b>

Author: minnesotachris


house.gov CampaignForLiberty.com Much has been made recently about the supposed economic recovery. A few blips in a few statistics and many believe our troubles are all over. Of course, they have to redefine recovery as jobless to account for the lack of improvement on Main Street. But the banks have money, Wall Street is chugging along, and the administration would like to get on with other agendae. They have even set up a commission to investigate the crisis as if it were all in the past. The truth is that Americans are still losing jobs, the Fed is still inflating, and more regulations are in the works that will prevent jobs and productivity from coming back. We are on this trajectory for the long haul. The claim has been made many times that this administration has only had a year to clean up the mess of the last administration. I wish they would at least get started! Instead of reversing course, they are maintaining Bushs policies full speed ahead. They are even keeping the Bush-appointee in charge of the Federal Reserve! They are not even making token efforts at change in economic policy. And for all the talk of transparency, we hear that some powerful senators will do all they can to block a simple audit of the powerful and secretive Federal Reserve. We have been on a disastrous course for a long time.

The "Texas miracle" is a model for job creation and according to government figures Texas has gained more jobs in June and this year, than any other state in the country. But on the other hand, the state has one of the worst budget shortfalls in the country, a rate of unemployment that has been on the rise and a fiscally responsible government policy that included filling holes with federal bailout money.

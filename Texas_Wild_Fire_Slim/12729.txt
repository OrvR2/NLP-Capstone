Update Wednesday morning
You can find all the latest info on the fires as of Wednesday on this post. 
Update at 7:15 p.m.
Here’s where we stand this evening:
The Bastrop Complex wildfire has claimed two lives, according to police. The blaze is now 34,000 acres and has destroyed 550 homes. Fire officials said they are making progress on the wildfire, but couldn’t yet say the level of containment.  (Story)
More than 4,000 Bastrop residents are evacuated, and many are trying their best to learn whether or not their homes have been destroyed. (Story)
The Union Chapel fire, in the Bastrop County community of Cedar Creek, is 20 percent contained. It has scorched 900 acres and destroyed 27 homes. About 200 people are evacuated.
The Leander fire is mostly contained, but police are now looking for four teenagers whom they believe are responsible for it. Eleven homes were destroyed in the 300 acre fire.  (Story)
Some Spicewood residents may be allowed back into their homes tomorrow. First, they have to pick up wrist bands and car signs at Bee Creek United Methodist Church.  The Pedernales Bend fire, the one that forced their evacuation, is now 80 percent contained.
People who live in the Steiner Ranch subdivision were allowed back into their homes at noon. Power has been restored to about 90 percent of residents. But Lake Travis' fire chief says people should expect continued operations in the area for the next three to five days as crews work to snuff out remaining flames and embers.
The Texas Forest Service lost about a third of its regular operating budget last week, almost $35 million over two years. It was part of the state legislature’s sweeping budget cuts that attempted to balance spending without increasing taxes. (Story)
Governor Rick Perry held a news conference at Steiner Ranch this morning, and criticized the federal bureaucracy for being slow to respond to requests for heavy equipment from Fort Hood. (Story)
Fires can spread frighteningly fast in these ultra-dry conditions. Watch this video to see just how fast.
Here’s a list of things you should bring if you have to evacuate. Here are some ways you can help fire victims.

Wondering how fast a wildfire can spread through the parched wilderness of Central Texas? Watch this video from Texas Parks and Wildlife, shot yesterday at Bastrop State Park.

Update at 2:55 p.m.
Smithville ISD schools will be closed again tomorrow. The district says its telephone service is down, and cell phone coverage is spotty. Bus routes are unable to run.
Update at 2:31 p.m.
Austin fire fighters are dealing with series of spot fires in a wooded area south of Parmer Lane. The alarm was called in around 1 p.m. at the end of Mustang Chase. Fire fighters brought in brush trucks to deal with the awkward terrain.
There were a few evacuations. They have now been lifted. The fire has also stopped traffic on a Union Pacific rail line.
Austin Energy said in a Tweet that it had to cut power to about 1,800 people in the area so AFD crews could battle the fire.
AFD Captain Marc Saenz told KUT News he was fairly confident the brush crews - those are firefighters cross trained in handling wildfires - could handle the blaze.  "We've got it where our guys can kind of handle it," he said.

Meanwhile, in Bastrop, some evacuated residents are getting anxious waiting to find out if their homes have been destroyed. Law enforcement officials are doing their best to share what information they can. One woman set up a Facebook page to share information about homes in the Tahitian Village neighborhood.
The risk of wildfires remains high in Central Texas, so you may want to take a few minutes to consider what items you should bring if you're forced to evacuate.
Update at 1:21 p.m.
State officials say air monitors in South and Central Texas show higher-than-normal readings of fine particles, but at a level that is not unhealthy for people with respiratory illness.
But closer to the fires, public health officials are warning people to evacuate areas with heavy smoke. People with sensitive respiratory illnesses, such as asthmatics and the elderly, should try to limit exposure to the outdoors if they can smell smoke.
The fire in Bastrop County has emitted enough smoke that it can be seen from outer space.
Update at 12:27 p.m.People evacuated from the Steiner Ranch subdivision are now being allowed to return to their homes. They will have to show photo ID to be let back in.We haven't been paying as much attention to the Jack Mountain fire near Fort Hood, given the immediate blazes in the Austin-area. But that wildfire grew by 700 acres overnight and has now blackened 3,700 acres.  No evacuation orders have been issued.Tensions got pretty high in northern Hays County last night as the Pedernales One fire appeared to be marching southward from Travis County toward Hays. Some evacuation orders had been issued, but were later rescinded once it became apparent that the fire wasn't immediately about to cross the county line.This morning, Hays County discontinued its fire information hotline for citizens and is now asking people to follow updates on their Twitter feed.Check out this picture of the smoke from the Bastrop fire rising behind the Austin skyline.Update at 11:55 a.m.The stubborn wildfire in Bastrop County has grown to almost 30,000 acres, and is zero percent contained. The blaze has already destroyed 476 buildings, despite the bold efforts of firefighters working to contain the inferno. Details on evacuation centers and road closures here.
Meanwhile, at Bastrop State Park, officials have been working hard to preserve Depression-era historic structures. But they now say that two may have been damaged by the fire.  All but 100 acres of the 6,000 acre state park have been ravaged by flames.
Park officials are also worried about the effects of the wildfires on the endangered Houston toad. The Lost Pines area of Bastrop is home to the largest known population of the amphibian.
The fire has also damaged the regional state park headquarters on State Highway 71.
The phones are out at Seton Smithville Regional Hospital as a result of the fire. The hospital itself is not damaged, nor is it in the fire's path at this time. Calls to the main number, 512-237-5777, have been routed to one cell phone. Hospital officials ask that you only call in the event of an emergency.
Update at 10:50 a.m.
The Austin Police Department says Steiner Ranch will reopen to evacuees at noon, according to KUT's Erika Aguilar. Units will patrol the area and ask non-residents to leave.
Earlier this morning, Governor Perry held a news conference at Steiner Ranch and hoped the weather would cooperate with firefighting efforts.
"As long as this wind stays down, we're going to be substantially well served from the point of containment," he said. The Wunderground.com hourly forecast suggests wind speeds could increase slightly this afternoon but will likely remain below 10 miles per hour.
Perry also couldn't resist a swipe at the federal government for what he says has been a slow response to requests for heavy equipment from Fort Hood.
State Sen. Kirk Watson (D-Austin) also spoke at the morning briefing. He urged non-Steiner Ranch residents to avoid the temptation to go see the damage for themselves.
"Those of us that don't live in Steiner Ranch need to make sure we're out of the way," he said. "I know we're interested. I know we care. I know we want to see what's going on. But we will best serve our neighbors, our family members, and our friends if we stay out of the way."

Last night's fire in Leander destroyed ten homes and damaged nine. The cause of the blaze is under investigation. Fire crews are still in the area this morning, suppressing flare-ups.
Update at 8:30 a.m.

The Travis County Sheriff’s Office told KUT News that as of six this morning the Spicewood fire is 80%  contained. The fire burned over 6,400 acres and damaged more than 60 structures including homes and barns. Highway 71 is shut down in both directions from the Hays-Travis county line to Pace Bend Road.

Update at 7:30 a.m.
The Leander Fire Department worked through the night on the fire off Moonglow. Williamson County officials say firefighters were responding to a possible flare-up this morning.
Residents of Mason Creek that were evacuated were allowed to return to their homes yesterday evening.
Williamson County says residents of Mason Creek North and High Chapparal won’t be allowed home until this morning at about 10 a.m.
As dawn broke over Central Texas the horizon was ringed with smoke and the smell of smoke was heavy in parts of Austin.
Update at 6:55 a.m.
Firefighters continue to battle wildfires that have scorched thousands of acres, destroyed hundreds of homes and forced evacuations across Central Texas.  Manchac Fire Chief Chris Barron working with the Austin Travis Emergency Management Center says the Bastrop fire-now over 25,000 acres- is uncontained and out of control.  Barron says about 500 homes have been lost in Bastrop County.  The Spicewood fire near the Pedernales River has burned about 6,000 acres.  Barron says things are slowing down at the Steiner Ranch fire. He says firefighters are getting it under control. Steiner Ranch residents will get an update later this morning as to whether they can return home.

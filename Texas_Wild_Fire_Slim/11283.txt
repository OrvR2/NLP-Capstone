Ted Cruz, GOP Senate candidates take shots at party establishment in Waco
By Michael W. Shapiro
Five conservative candidates for U.S. Senate took aim at President Obama, Congress, Washington bureaucrats and the Republican establishment late Saturday in a forum sponsored by the Waco Tea Party.
Ted Cruz, Texas’ former solicitor general, won over some of the crowd right off the bat by working a defense of the tea party movement into his opening statement.
After the Standard & Poor’s downgraded the U.S.’s long-term credit rating, Cruz said, “this president had the audacity to blame the tea party.”
“It’s a little like Charlie Sheen blaming the Betty Ford Clinic,” he added. (It was a line Cruz tried out earlier Saturday in Charleston, S.C., where he warmed up a crowd for Gov. Rick Perry’s presidential announcement.)
But Cruz saved ammunition for Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. Dewhurst didn’t attend the event, but given his considerable personal wealth and statewide name recognition he's a favorite in the race.
“There’s an establishment candidate who’s a gazillionaire,” Cruz said. “He’s gonna spend $20 million saturating the airwaves with ads portraying him as a mix of Ronald Reagan and the Marlboro Man.”
Cruz argued however that he is the genuine conservative article, and he rattled off a number of endorsements from tea party-backed members of the Senate, including Jim DeMint, S.C., and Rand Paul, Ky. who he said “need reenforcements.”
Texas Railroad Commission chairwoman Elizabeth Ames Jones focused on what she described as a bloated and ineffective federal workforce, while speaking to the crowd of about 110.
At one point she described an epiphany she had while grabbing lunch at the Department of Energy's cafeteria in Washington, where she was in town to give testimony.
“It was a darn good cafeteria line,” Jones said, but what are these people doing to make our lives better tomorrow? Nothing.”
She went on to give a full-throated defense of the practice of hydraulic fracturing, or cracking rock formations by blasting them with a fluid to free up natural gas.
Federal studies into the environmental impact of the practice amount to a search for “a problem that doesn’t exist,” Jones said.
She also referred to Perry as “our next United States president,” praising his leadership as governor. (Cruz had endorsed Perry earlier in the day.)
Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert, the current fund-raising leader in the Senate race didn’t attend.
Glenn Addison made his anti-establishment philosophy a dominant theme during his segment of the forum.
The folksy Magnolia mortician described himself as a “common man running, who’s got some common sense, not a career politician, or a Harvard lawyer.”
The last descriptor was a reference to Cruz, who went to Harvard Law School, after graduating from Princeton.
Addison also won the biggest laugh of the night after being asked if he would resign in the face of a personally embarrassing situation.
“The good lord knows I have my struggles, but I don’t struggle with holding cameras different ways,” he said in a reference to former Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., who eventually gave up his office after sending revealing pictures of himself to women he’d met on Facebook.
“And being a good tightwad my underwear is pretty old, so no I don’t do that.”
Lela Pittenger and Andrew “Cas” Castanuela also made pitches that they’d be the best replacements for retiring Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.
Pittenger, a Hays County activist, said she’d be the face of two underrepresented groups in the Senate, younger people and women.
“We continue to give (conservative women) voices they cannot relate to,” she said, adding that she represents an “evangelism opportunity.”
Castanuela, a Brownsville military veteran, said he supports capping federal spending while implementing a balanced budget amendment.
Though the candidates focused on how best to scale back the authority or budgets of numerous federal agencies, there was one area of the federal government a number of the candidates thought should be increased.
Castanuela, Cruz and Jones all advocated for more border patrol agents.

I believe all the candidates I heard speak have a heart felt interest in trying to improve our current situation. It wouldn't bother me to see all of them serving in some kind of capacity.

All political rhetoric. They do not have a clue about reality. TRC chairwoman Jones should watch that rhetoric about bloated workforces. Texas state government workers aren't anything to brag about. Get a clue lady, Federal workers have to eat lunch too. Whoever is elected Senator out of this group of "hopefuls" is in for a big shock when they get to Washington.

I attended the senatorial forum last night. Impressive comments from most all candidates. I was most impressed with Ted Cruz's comments and Lela Pittenger’s comments. I was however taken aback somewhat by part of Andrew Castanuela's closing comment when he stated he was the only Hispanic candidate in the senatorial race who was born in the USA. I'm quite sure a vast majority of those of us who attended last night's forum are not using that yardstick as a determining factor of who gets our support and vote. Besides, the only other Hispanic candidate in the senatorial race is Ted Cruz. If Mr. Castanuela has a problem with Mr. Cruz as to where he was born he ought to just say what he has on his mind. I will say that kind of negative campaign strategy won't work. The sad part about all this is after Mr. Castanuela made his “I’m the only Hispanic is this race who was born in the USA” comment he finished his forum comments with a prayer. Figure that one out?

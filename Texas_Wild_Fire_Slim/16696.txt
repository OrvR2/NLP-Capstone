Whitney rebuilds after losing strong seniors

Whitney has just one returner from last year’s 37-3 regional final team, which has left the team inconsistent so far this season.“We have definitely improved our skills,” Whitney coach Cheryl Gilchrist said. “I have seen a huge difference from our first scrimmage to now. Hopefully we can fix the mistakes we are having from being young.”Last year’s Super Centex Newcomer of the Year Kelsey Leech is the lone returner to a team that has just one senior on the roster and will rely heavily on underclassmen when district starts Friday.Leech blended well with the senior talent the Wildcats possessed a year ago. The junior was a team leader in digs as well being a key contributor in almost every statistic while not missing a match throughout the year. This year Leech will need to add leadership to her list of contributions.— David Ash

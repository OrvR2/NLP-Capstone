Remembering The Onion’s 9/11 issue: ‘Everyone thought this would be our last issue in print’By Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – Thu, Aug 25, 2011


On September 10, 2001, employees of  the satirical national newspaper,  The Onion, gathered at the Bowery Ballroom on Manhattan's Lower East  Side for a party to celebrate their first New York issue, which was due  to be published the next day.
The  band They Might Be Giants performed. Whiskey flowed. Friends proposed.   The world, as far as these transplanted Wisconsiners were concerned,  was theirs.
But when they woke up the next day, as John Krewson, a longtime writer for The Onion, put it, "the world had changed."
Like  many of his Park Slope neighbors, Krewson watched in horror from the  roof of a Brooklyn brownstone with a clear view of the World Trade  Center, as the events of Sept. 11 unfolded. He eventually went  inside to turn on CNN for the rest of the afternoon.
That Sept. 11 issue of The Onion never made it to print.
The  next week, the staff--which had moved operations from Madison,  Wisconsin, to Manhattan a few months before--gathered at The Onion's  offices on 20th Street. "It was a terrible meeting," Krewson recalls.  "We knew we wouldn't be able to ignore what had happened, but it was  hard to make any sort of comedy."
Eventually, Krewson remembers, one of the staffers said that American life had become "a bad Jerry Bruckheimer movie."
That headline, which would become a front-page story in the 9/11 issue, got the ball rolling, and loosened everyone up, Krewson says.
Another one, by former head writer Carol Kolb, got the comedic juices flowing even more.

"It was poignant," Krewson says. "It captured how stunned and confused everyone was at that time."
Others headlines followed:

Hijackers Surprised To Find Selves in Hell: 'We Expected Eternal Paradise for This,' Say Suicide Bombers
God Angrily Clarifies 'Don't Kill' Rule
Rest of Country Temporarily Feels Deep Affection for New York
Massive Attack on Pentagon Page 14 News
Hugging Up 76,000 Percent
The  Onion's now-classic 9/11 issue was slowly but surely coming together.  But the staff was still worried about how it would be received by a city  still grieving from the worst terrorist attack ever on American soil.
"Everyone thought this would be our last issue in print," Krewson says.
The Onion's 9/11 issue--its first in New York--hit the streets on Sept. 26. When  staffers arrived in the office the next day, the fax machine was  overflowing with comments from readers—virtually all of them positive.
"The top one just read 'That's funny, that's funny, that's funny,'" Krewson says.
Given the feedback, Krewson knew they had hit on something, though not necessarily comedy.
"It  wasn't an especially funny issue. In fact, I'd say it was the least  funny issue we've ever done," Krewson says. "But it was cathartic."
"The hijackers piece--that is just brutal, brutal, physical comedy."
Nonetheless, it is, to this day, the most commented-on issue of The Onion.
"Not  a week goes by [that] I'm not asked about it," Krewson says. "A lot of  the younger writers—who weren't around then—are sick of hearing  about it."
Despite the enduring popularity of the 9/11 issue,  don't expect The Onion to join the rest of the media in revisiting the  September 11 attacks on their 10th anniversary.
"If we did something," Krewson says, "it would mean we haven't moved on."

I still think about that issue- I read it when it came out, and thought it really was one of the most brilliant things they had done.

The "God Angrily Clarifies No Killing Rule" almost made me cry, in a good way. It was funny, yet very moving. We need these messages just as desperately today as we did 10 years ago.

I always loved the headline:  "Hijackers Surprised to Find Selves in Hell".   I am sure they are all burning there for eternity.

It was a great issue.  Hilarious!

The attitude behind "The Onion" is the polar opposite of the miserable #$%$#39; that attacked us.  I say keep it up.

I think it was completely tasteless. I guess it wouldn't have been so funny if they had lost loved ones in the twin towers or the Pentagon or in the PA field. Disgusting!

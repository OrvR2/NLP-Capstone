Bastrop Texas Wildfire 9-5-2011 (view from FM 304 & Hwy 71) This fire seems to consume the whole horizon. Many homes were lost and it will be days before it is contained. This brush fire has destroyed more homes that any fire in Texas History. If anyone has exact information that they can share with me I will state exact facts on my video.

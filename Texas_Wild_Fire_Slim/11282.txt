       9.10.11]------The National Football League wrapped up a sweet deal with ESPN for a whopping $15.2 billion, 8 year contract. According to the Financial Times, this deal will allow the very lucrative Monday night football to continue on Walt Disney sports cable along with 3D distribution on its new 3D channels, as well as international rights. ESPN will reportedly expand their viewership to 30 million in 144 more countries, including the Caribbean, Africa, Europe, Australia and Brazil. The new contract, which is reportedly 70 percent higher than the current one, will start when the current one ends in 2014 and run until 2021. ESPN's competitor, Comcast, is reportedly also trying to buy into the extremely profitable television sports market and recently outbid Disney and ESPN for the rights to the next 4 Olympics games starting in 2014. Comcast also purchased the U.S. Ice Hockey rights for a cool $2 Billion extended over 10 years. Read it here: ESPN extends NFL contract in $15.2bn deal         1 of 1

An ending that is also a beginning
This last week of school is such a whirlwind of activity. I have enjoyed recently so many of the events that are geared toward creating lasting memories for the Class of 2011. A very special thank you goes out to the parents who have made these special occasions ones that the kids can enjoy now and remember for decades. Celebration of graduation is a community-wide event and I think it appropriate that Polka Festival is so close to graduation – it just makes the party last a little longer! The term “commencement” has been used as long as I can remember (or find references for) to signify the end of a life phase – like the end of elementary school, the end of vacation Bible school and other important periods. When I learned to read and got a definition for “commencement” that meant “start” it took me several more years to finally understand that any event marking the end of one life phase also signified the start of a new phase.

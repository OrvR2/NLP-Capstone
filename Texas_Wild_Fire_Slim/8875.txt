Canada to bring back terror-fighting measures: PMAFP – 19 hrs ago

Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Canada will soon bring back controversial anti-terrorism measures, defending them in a television interview that airs Wednesday as "necessary" to thwart possible attacks.
The measures allowed for the detention of suspects without charges for up to 72 hours and for judges to compel witnesses to testify at trial.
They were first introduced in 2001 following the September 11 attacks in the United States, but opposition parties blocked their renewal in 2007.
"We think those measures are necessary. We think they've been useful," Harper said in the interview to be aired Wednesday evening on public broadcaster CBC. "They're applied rarely, but there are times when they're needed."
Now, Harper commands a majority of seats in the House of Commons for the first time, after a general election in May, and can use it to force through changes to the act.
Harper said the lapsed measures must be reenacted because Canada still faces security threats.
"The major threat is still Islamicism," he said. "There are other threats out there, but that is the one that I can tell you occupies the security apparatus most regularly.
"As we've seen in Norway, terrorism threats can come out of the blue. It can come from something completely different, and there are other groups and individuals that if given the chance would engage in terrorism.
"Threats exist all over the world. We've seen some recent bombings in Nigeria, domestic Nigerian terrorists."
Canada also is keeping an eye out for homegrown terrorists, he said.

Yeah, the timing of this is no surprise. Fear mongering. Some 7 Billion iirc spent already, for nothing. No added safety or security. Now he wants to bring it back, spend even more, and we still won't be safer because the government really couldn't care less about safety. It's all about power (for them) and money (for the back pocket lobbyists whose last wish is safety and stability as it is directly opposed to their profits). And all you harpies who fall for it hook, line, and sinker make me cry for your intelligence or gullibility.

Here we go again with Harper now in full control of his police state. He can now have the police pick up anyone on suspicion, without just cause or a warrant.
If he kept his nose out of the US wars he wouldn't have to implement measures to thwart terrorism, but being the idiot he is, he does what ever he is told.
If he didn't have the Canadian forces attack Islamic nations he wouldn't have to worry about them attacking us. 
His style of politics is fear. He governs by implementing fear, real or imaginary. He did this during the last election. Once a government starts on the fear path they can never stop. The people would find out the truth if they did. He perceives himself to be the vanquisher of fears, when all along he himself is the purveyor of fear.
Hopefully Canadians will see this before the next election comes around.

Momentum builds behind Amanda Knox appealBy Mike KrumboltzMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz | The Envoy – 10 hrs ago

Is the incarceration of Amanda Knox coming to an end?
The American college student and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were found guilty of murdering Meredith Kercher in 2007. Knox has long proclaimed her innocence. Now, after Knox and Sollecito have spent years in prison and turned up for countless court appearances, an Italian prosecutor says that both suspects are likely to be acquitted.
According to the U.K. Telegraph, "court appointed experts have criticised the way the original forensic investigation was carried out by police." Knox won a recent victory in court, when the prosecutors' request to conduct further examinations on DNA evidence was denied. Independent experts contend that some of the DNA evidence against Knox should not have been admitted as evidence.
This doesn't necessarily mean that Knox will be freed, but it does give the jailed 24-year-old hope. Her days behind bars may come to an end if judges see things her way in the appeal. Below, a brief history of the case that has kept millions transfixed for years.Click on image to view photos of Amanda KnoxAmanda Knox, the U.S. student convicted of killing her British flatmate Meredith Kercher in Italy on November 2007, …
The crime: Knox, Sollecito, and a third man, Rudy Guede, were accused and jailed for the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher. Kercher, who was from England, was stabbed to death in the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy. She was also sexually assaulted.
The rumors: After Kercher's body was discovered, rumors began to swirl that the crime was some sort of sexual act gone horribly wrong. Many in the media took to referring to Amanda as Foxy Knoxy. Some people, including Knox's parents, felt that this nickname painted Amanda as some sort of seductress and helped convict her.
The evidence: Much of the case hinged on DNA taken from a 12-inch knife found at the murder scene. Investigators found Kercher's DNA on the blade, and Knox's on the handle. A recent review found that much of that DNA was unreliable and may have been contaminated by sloppy police work. That's good news for Knox.
The frenzy: Ever since the murder was reported, Web searches have been incredibly high. Even now, four years later, online interest in Knox remains huge. Over the past 24 hours, searches on "amanda knox" and "amanda knox trial" have both roared to huge gains. Not surprisingly, "foxy knoxy pictures" are also popular.
What's next: The closing arguments on the appeal are set to start later this month, on Sept. 23. Perhaps shortly thereafter, there will be real closure for all involved.

"Perhaps shortly thereafter, there will be real closure for all involved."  How about the victim's family?  Pretty insensitive article but I want her released.

Give it a rest Sherri...and don't lower yourself to playing the race card. You know nothing about it if that's your reason for her being innocent.

What about her confession to the police back in 2007? She seems like a pretty confused individual....

They won't allow me on a jury anymore.  When they ask if I can be fair, I just say two words:  Mike Nifong.  Quite simply, I trust the prosecution even less than the defense.

police and prosecutors will lie and make up evidence to make an innocent person guilty. especially if there is a paycheck at the end for them.

She's guilty. She confessed. With millions of innocent men in American jails why not free them? 

American girls think they can act like they do in the US abroad. They can't. The equality that girls want so bad exists in other country. A girl can be convicted in Europe or Asia. Casey Anthony wouldn't have walked in Saudi Arabia or Italy. And that's just fine with me.

Wait, you mean her DNA was on the handle of a kitchen knife from her own apartment?! No sh*t...This guy Rudy Guede, who was a drug addict, thief, and drifter already confessed to the murder. Amanda got railroaded by the Italian prosecutors...

I've followed this case very closely. I have some issues with the prosecutor's theory of a sex orgy gone bad and the DNA evidence looks unreliable.

Nevertheless, I have no doubt this girl is guilty or, at the very least, had something to do with the murder of Meredith Kercher. However, someone should not be convicted on a gut feeling. From a purely legal point of view she should be acquitted and let go.

Once she is freed her parents should make sure she gets the therapy she needs. Guilty or innocent I think Amanda has something seriously off with her.

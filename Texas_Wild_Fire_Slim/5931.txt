U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh has not been shy about criticizing President Obama in the Chicagoland area as of late. While he usually speaks to a supportive crowd of Republicans and Tea Party members, he found himself facing a more critical audience Tuesday: a group of suburban Chicago high school students. 
Walsh stopped by Mundelein High School Tuesday to speak with a pair of AP Government classes, according to the Daily Herald. The stop came just days after announcing that he will not be attending President Barack Obama's Sept. 8 jobs speech and calling the president "idiotic" during another northern Illinois appearance. He later apologized for that remark. 
Walsh reportedly told students that he would read the president's speech, but said that calling a joint session of Congress should be reserved for "pretty big deals," the Chicago Tribune reports. He said that Obama's proposals do not meet that criteria. 
Students asked Walsh about his allegedly unpaid child support, and he once again denied the allegations. In a court filing, his ex-wife claimed that Walsh owed $115,294 in unpaid obligations and interest. He also said that "personal stuff" prevents the best Democrats and Republicans from running for office. 
The Tribune has more on what Walsh heard from some students:  
When asked about the Tea Party and its beliefs, Walsh first turned the question back to students, asking them what they think when they hear the term "Tea Party." Students' responses included: "Republicans," "reducing taxes" and "Fox News."

Self-proclaimed liberal Samuel Cruz, 16, described the Tea Party as "a small group of people who are insane and out of touch with reality."
Walsh defended the Tea Party, describing them as a big group of people who are frustrated about government spending. 
"We're not all insane," he added, according to the Tribune. 
Walsh will be in Illinois again Thursday--while President Obama makes his jobs speech. 
"I'm going to fly back home and talk to the folks who really know what we need to do when it comes to job creation, not this president," he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday.

				And does anyone remember when people didn't want Obama to talk to school children?

But this DEAD-BEAT-­DAD who called the President a liar is permitted? 

I realize these are older children - however, Walsh is NOT okay...and doesn't even look okay and I suspect his intellect matches his lack in other areas...no­t to forget being responsibl­e...like taking care of your children's health and welfare (not paying child support impacts that),.

				Walsh is NOT okay --- shouldn't be talking to students - however, in this case - they knew more than he thought they did.  

(comment from article):  "Walsh reportedly told students that he would read the president'­s speech, but said that calling a joint session of Congress should be reserved for "pretty big deals," the Chicago Tribune reports. He said that Obama's proposals do not meet that criteria."

What a leader he illustrate­d that he NOT-- to NOT attend, but would read the speech simply  let those students know that he a not real patriot - not a congressma­n who has the interests of the people at heart - not a man who has the wherewitha­ll to hear out an opponent and disagree civilly.

Seems they knew he was just a DEAD-BEAT-­DAD - guess that's all they needed to know.

				We went through the years of name calling and racist slurs that now it doesn't mean anything because everyone realizes that when been bills get passed that all suffer not just a few and when the bills the president passes every enjoy the benefits regards of race color or creed. 

Children and young adults will be the one who will be responsibl­e for getting the president reelected by educationi­ng their parents who are too set in their ways to listen to sane people, so the children will be the ones the teaparty need to be afraid of.


I guess Walsh went to the school because he felt safe, since now that they have town hall meetings they get cornered on their own untruths and they are afraid to face them.  It was fine to them when the democrats and the president was getting hollered and screamed at but now that the shoes is on the other foot, they don't like.  But they don't know how to get out of it and they will keep right on doing what they are doing right up to the last vote counting the president in for his second term.

				I think Walsh and other republican­s/teaparti­es are going to learn so really hard lessons this time around.  Sure they brainwashe­d a lot of people into voting for them in November but now they are have regrets and they should.  They went on blind faith that their so called leaders were going to impeach the president, repeal hcr back to no insurance, defund all the programs for the people and finish the job that Bush left.  Oh they were suppose to create a jobs too.

Out of all the things that they said they would do, they have only kept one of the promise and that is to try to go back to the days of Bush.  They want to play around with ss, medicare, medicaid unemployme­nt benefits and other programs that help the americanpe­ople.  No jobs have been create, but they have seen to it that a lot more have been lost and then they blame the president for it.

No matter how much they try to destroy the president, this time around it will be the republican­s/ teaparties leaving congress and the president still in the white house.  They are so afraid that he will make things happen for the better that they are falling all over each other trying to think of the most insane thing to do or say.  It really is beginning to fall on deaf ears including their followers they once had convince to believe in them.

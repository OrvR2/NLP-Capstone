Even 'Stimulus Skeptics' Should Back Obama's Plan
It's a reasonable effort to guard against a double-dip: David Brooks

(Newser) -
                                    David Brooks counts himself among the "stimulus skeptics," but he's signing on to  President Obama's plan  to juice the economy. The president's proposals come from "the middle of the ideological spectrum," and collectively they help guard against the "truly horrifying" prospect of...

Obama Plan Would Bring 1.9M Jobs: Moody's
Would grow economy 2%, says expert

(Newser) -
                                    President Obama’s jobs plan  would put some 1.9 million people back to work and grow the economy 2%, says Moody’s chief economist. The plan could slice the unemployment rate by a percentage point, adds Mark Zandi, whose analysis comes as the president heads to Virginia to...

Obama's Plan 'Bolder, Better Than Expected'
Pundits from left and right generally praise address

(Newser) -
                                    Pundits handed out good grades aplenty for President Obama's new jobs proposal last night, with generally positive feedback from liberals like Paul Krugman—but also from conservatives like David Frum and Andrew Sullivan.   Krugman writes in the  New York Times  that he was "favorably surprised by the new ...

Bachmann Will Rebut Obama's Speech
She appears to be only Republican planning to do so

(Newser) -
                                    As she  struggles to stay relevant  in the 2012 presidential race, Michele Bachmann has figured out at least one more way to keep her name in the news. She’ll offer a rebuttal to President Obama’s jobs speech tonight at 8:30pm,  The Hill  reports. No formal Republican response...

What to Watch for in Obama's Jobs Speech
Can the president appease his base and Republicans at once?

(Newser) -
                                    President Obama gives his much-hyped jobs speech tonight, and though the stakes are high, expectations are  pretty low . Obama’s “task is nearly impossible,”  Politico  writes: “appease liberals, appeal to independents, win over some Republicans and make a compelling case to Washington-weary voters.” Here’s what...

Tax Relief, Public Works to Drive $300B Jobs Plan
School renovations, unemployment benefit extension part of strategy

(Newser) -
                                    President Obama plans tomorrow to unveil a $300 billion jobs strategy that will involve tax relief for workers and spending on public works projects such as road repair and school renovations to put America back to work, according to sources familiar with the plan. Half of the stimulus will come...

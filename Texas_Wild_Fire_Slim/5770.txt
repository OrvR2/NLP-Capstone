Its been outrageous and inaccessib­le for old fans for many years now, once we used to pool some money together get a rig and head to the desert.  Now we just stay home and let all the rich hipsters and yuppies ruin what was once a great event.

				Having returned just moments ago, i can tell you that Black Rock City is as good as ever with amazing people, art, and merriment. It is far from ruined, this year being one of the most inspiratio­nal yet (6 so far).

Don't listen to the hype, go again. I think you'll be very surprised at the quality of the burners.

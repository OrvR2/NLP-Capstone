Darden warns 1Q took a hit from IreneAP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011





ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Darden Restaurants Inc., the owner of the Red Lobster, Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, warned that its first quarter earnings took a hit from Hurricane Irene.The company, based in Orlando, Fla., said the storm cut fiscal quarterly earnings by about 2 cents per share. Darden expects earnings per share from continuing operations of 78 cents per share for the period.Darden said it expects full-year earnings per share growth to come in at the low end of its previously announced range of 12 to 15 percent.The company also said that combined revenue from its restaurants that have been open at least a year, considered a key measure of a retailer's financial performance, are expected to be up 2.8 percent for the first quarter over the prior year. This measure strips away the impact of recently opened or closed stores.This key sales measure rose 10.7 percent at Red Lobster and 4.8 percent at Longhorn Steakhouse, while it fell 2.9 percent at Olive Garden.Darden is scheduled to release its first-quarter results on Sept. 28.Shares of Darden fell $1.88, more than 4 percent, to $44.30 in after-hours trading Tuesday.

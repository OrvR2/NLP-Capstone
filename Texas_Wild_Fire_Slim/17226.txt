@MegaELECTRICEYE -﻿ Nice backed handed slap :LO) We do not want fed $. We do not want ANYTHING fed. We want the Feds to leave and not come back. Were I live we have have 3 inches of rain this year - we normaly get about 35-40. I know the black helicopters forgot to bring the rain this year... But, that is ok - I am safe in my foil hat!!

@GlenRoSSe69 That could be true, who knows.﻿ The same for the Texas wildfires I bet that is a lie also. So Texas can get more of our money. They are being set by our government, and they are blaming the conditions on lack of rain. OR someone being careless.

@MegaELECTRICEYE _ meg do not mean to rain on your day - But the Seal attack never happened. OBL has been dead BEFORE the 911 attack. Go look at the FBI web site OBL is NOT wanted for the 911 attack - Mossad did the attack my dear. I would say that the Buzh family was also in﻿ on the 911 attack, as they are BEST friends with OBL family!! O-bomb-a is just Buzh term 3. It is all a big fat LIE. :O)

@GlenRoSSe69 AMEN I agree then the jerk had to send the Navy Seals to Kill OBL. Those Guys on 9/11 that hit the World trade center did not mean to﻿ do that. They just wanted to help the pilots fly those planes. Then the liberals got mad at Bush for going after our oil in Iraq, and giving them Freedoms. Also Obama has yet to get me a JOB. Or fix Clintons economic mess. How dare Obama blame BUSH he was a President meaning he was not responsible or in Charge.

@MatrixFactoryGuy Really? That's why it's a State didaster, not a federal disaster. We don't get fed money for a state emergency. No state does, idiot. Go﻿ hate on someone else.

Pray for Texas Please.
II Chronicles 7:13-14, "If I shut up﻿ heaven that there be no rain... If My people which are called by My name shall humble themselves and pray, and seek My face, and TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land." Forgive us that we have cursed Your name so much both in public schools and on tv and at home. Please have mercy and forgive us. Send rain today Oh Lord. In Jesus Name

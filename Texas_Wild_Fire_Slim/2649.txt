Palestinians resist US pressure on statehood bidBy MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH - Associated Press | AP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — The Palestinians on Tuesday said they would not give in to American pressure to drop their bid for statehood at the United Nations, taking a tough position ahead of a meeting with a senior U.S. delegation.Two senior White House envoys, David Hale and Dennis Ross, arrived in the region on Tuesday for talks with Israel and Palestinian officials. The U.S. has been trying to persuade the Palestinians to drop their plan to ask the U.N. this month to approve their independence and instead resume peace talks with Israel.Yasser Abed Rabbo, a top adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said there was little the Americans could do to change the Palestinians' plans."We are going to the United Nations, regardless of objections or pressure," he said. Abbas is expected to meet with Hale on Wednesday. Ross, who is viewed by the Palestinians as pro-Israel, was not scheduled to attend the meeting.The comments signaled more frustration for President Barack Obama, who has made little progress in nurturing peace talks despite pledges to make Mideast diplomacy a priority.The Palestinians say they are turning to the U.N. after years of sporadic, and inconclusive, peace talks with Israel.Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem — areas claimed by the Palestinians — in the 1967 Mideast war. Both Israel and the U.S. oppose the U.N. initiative, saying peace can be reached only through negotiations. Israel has called for a resumption of talks without preconditions.The American team was meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday.Barak's office said his discussions focused on "the regional situation and strategy issues," including the Palestinians. He did not elaborate. There was no immediate comment from either Netanyahu's office or the Americans.Abbas confirmed this week that he has held secret talks with the Israeli president and defense minister in recent weeks, but was unable to reach any breakthrough.In a separate matter, an Israeli defense official said Tuesday that the military has temporarily suspended its contentious policy of demolishing illegally built Palestinian homes in the West Bank. The official said the order was issued after determining the policy is not equally enforced against illegally built Jewish settler homes.Palestinians have bitterly complained that demolitions are arbitrary and lopsided and that it's difficult for them to get Israeli construction permits.The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order, which was issued in an internal memorandum. He didn't say how long the order would last.Also Tuesday, Netanyahu condemned the torching of a mosque in the West Bank earlier in the week, that came a few hours after the Israeli military dismantled structures in an unauthorized West Bank outpost. The name of the outpost, Migron, was spray painted on the mosque, suggesting the act was settler retaliation for the demolitions.Menachem Froman, a rabbi from the settlement of Tekoa who promotes coexistence between Palestinians and settlers, visited the mosque on Tuesday to reconcile between the two sides.In Gaza Tuesday, a Palestinian militant was killed by an Israeli missile as he fired rockets at southern Israel, Gaza Health Ministry spokesman Adham Abu Salmia said. The Israeli military said it hit militants firing mortars.___Associated Press writer Amy Teibel in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness —- that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness." — US Declaration of Independence

It is easy to take these truths for granted, but they should not be taken for granted. There are many nations whose governments exist or exercise certain powers without the consent of the governed and tyrannize over the governed: such nations include Burma, China, North Korea, and Saudi Arabia. There are other nations where governments that are based on the consent of the governed and honor and protect the rights of the governed only came into existence recently: such nations include Germany, Taiwan, South Korea, and Romania. Right now, the people of Libya are concluding a noble and patriotic war to end the reign of terror of Moammar Qaddafi, and are preparing to found a new government whose existence is based on the consent of the governed and whose task will be to protect the newfound freedom of all Libyans; and the people of Syria and Yemen are carrying out similar struggles for the same purposes. Long ago, the original thirteen states of the United States broke away from Britain to be free from the tyranny of London.

Then there is Palestine. The Palestinians are victims of decades of tyranny by the government of Israel. The government of Israel rules over the West Bank; but the Palestinians in the West Bank are not citizens of Israel and thus have no say in the decisions made by government of Israel, even those decisions that directly affect them. Since the government of Israel is not accountable to the people it governs in the West Bank, it is free to tyrannize over them. The Israeli government confiscates Palestinian-owned homes in the West Bank, evicts the residents, and gives the land to Israelis; and there is nothing the Palestinians can do about it through the political process. The Israeli government has designated certain roads in the West Bank — the Palestinians' own homeland — that Palestinians are forbidden to drive on, and the Palestinians cannot elect representatives to the Knesset who favor the repeal of that law.

This tyranny is what the Palestinians seek freedom from. The Palestinians do not want independence just for the sake of independence. They want independence because they know that the Israeli government will violate their rights rather than protect them; and they wish to create their own government, one that will be more likely to protect their rights.

End all financial aid to the Palestinian's. It is a waste of U.S. Taxpayor money. Why are we paying for Palestinian terrorism, text books that teach jihad and hatred of us.

U.S. should adopt the policy of neutrality in the Palestinian bid for statehood. America has been refusing statehood for Palestine while interposing no objection in the Israeli acts of settling the land of the Palestinians and demolishing their houses and establishments by excessive force . The Palestinians are becoming strangers to their territory. Where is justice and what is really the role of Americans? Global cop, peacemaker or etc.?

AS A SPOKESPERSON FOR AMERICA'S ICONS OF TRASH: How will my favorite icons of television will ever be able to return to Israel after over 2,000 years. I worry about Jerry Springer and Maury Povich, these jews are Semitic people from the 12-tribes of Israel. My biggest worries are the chairmen of America's central bank the Federal Reserve, Paul Volker, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke. Nazis say that the icons of trash television have destroyed society and the Federal Reserve chairmen have destroyed the economy. I think Howard "the shock jock" Stern the jewish entertainer is like Moses. Contact Homeland Security when ever a nazi criticizes these biblical decendants of Abraham, after all they are Federally protected!

We need to dump this project, they don't want peace.  The entire Arab world uses them as a measuring stick.  The British dumped this crap on us, because the seen a con job occuring.  Why in hell the Jews need to live in this god-forsaken place is beyond me.  It ticks me off to the point that I'd like to destroy it so that NOBODY gets it.

I fail to see what America's interest is in this. Parasites on one side and terrorists on the other. Just cut all political and financial ties with both sides and walk away. We were never a honest broker anyway. Have the IDF pay their own bills.

The poor child, who knows what has happened to him by now. His parents are stupid for having 8 children. If they had only 2 or 3 they could actually keep track of them.

You know the USA puts out amber alert on the spot but yet Canada waits!!! WTFFF  If that little boy was my son I would have contacted the A RADIO STATION OR NEWSPAPER  RIGHT AWAY!!  GET OFF YOUR ASSES MOUNTIES AND DO YOUR WORK PROPERLY!!!!

The RCMP know exactly what they are doing.  Let them do their job.

That bag of dirt that is suspected of taking the boy has had previous record with similar types of charges.

The press can't even get their facts correct! Yesterdays report said the parents found he was missing at 9:00am and the Alert was issued at 5:00pm-ish. Listen above to the timeline!!! We can't even be told the truth! Which times are correct?
The again, the fact remains, keep your fingers crossed for this little guy....

These idiots failed as parents.  They put a 3 year old to be and didn't bother to check on him?  NO one in the house heard anything?  BULL!  They can live with the fact they failed their child.




 








Julie
Yesterday

It came 10 hours after he disappeared because the police want to give the guy a chance to get away I guess.




 








rc
Yesterday

I just hope they find him alive! My heart goes out to the parents and family members of Kienan.

Amber Alert...IMMEDIATELY!  Missing, lost, abducted children do not care about, criteria, requirements, rules or laxness of police procedure. They just want ot be FOUND and go HOME!!!!

Justice Sestems in Canada should Change.Please,please,politicians do something,Get Tough with our justice Rulings,,.before its too late..right,issue all Amber Alert,Across Canada,Enough of Red tapes.

Alberta always behind the rest of Canada so stuck into those tar ponds they just can.t seem to move to fast.




 








guy
Yesterday

it's clearly our justice system's fault.  Did you see the guy's criminal record.  It didn't take a rocket scientist to know he would do something like that.  I hope this never happens again, but if it does, I hope it happens to the judges or parole officer's child.  That way this nonsense would end forever




 








Wowzers
Yesterday

all you gotta do is look at the suspect to know he's a dirtbag!!...sure hope they find this little boy...




 








Nancy
Yesterday

This is horrible. Anyone who has a remote cabin in BC needs to go check it. He's been caught hiding and living in peoples cabins before.




 








SoniSat
Yesterday

I hope they find that poor little child. A parents worse nightmare!

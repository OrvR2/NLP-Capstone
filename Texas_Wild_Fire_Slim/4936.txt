Luxury retailer introduces solid gold phone with a $60,000 price tagBy Mike WehnerPostsBy Mike Wehner | Today in Tech – 18 hrs ago

AE+Y phone kicks smartphone features to the curb, but will the rich care?
Feature-rich smartphones aren't cheap, and critics of pricey mobile devices often claim that they are too expensive, despite their wide-ranging capabilities. Those people will want to look away now, as the newest device from Danish luxury retailer Aesir is sure to make their blood boil. Introducing the limited edition AE+Y phone — an 18-carat solid gold handset that can't use apps, email, or mobile internet, but still carries a ridiculous price of 42,000 euros (roughly $60,000).
The Aesir AE+Y is more shiny than smartThe lavish device boasts groundbreaking features such as speed dial, call forwarding, and even a built-in calculator. Its LCD screen measures a modest 2", and its battery can handle a measly 5 hours of talk time — compared to the Droid Bionic's 11-hour, and iPhone 4's 14-hour limits. But Aesir is focusing more on form than function, and the manufacturer is quick to point out that the edge-to-edge key design is a first in mobile handsets.
The AE+Y's barebones user interface was shaped by renowned designer Tom Hingston, and the phone's unorthodox keypad is laser-engraved and features "advanced LED backlighting." We're not quite sure how that varies from regular LED backlighting, but I guess we have to take Aesir's word on that.
Aesir's target market is clearly the super rich, but do the wealthy not also desire useful gadgets? Then again, if you're affluent enough to drop $60,000 on a solid gold phone, you're probably too busy playing polo and ordering around your servants to care about apps or email anyway.
For those of you who are only rich — as opposed to super rich — Aesir is also making a stainless steel version which will retail for a slightly less mind boggling $10,000. Both devices will debut this fall in Europe, and shortly thereafter in the U.S.

The rich are always looking for trinkets and baubles like this to spend the millions in windfall from tax cuts.  This is how "trickle down" economics works:  give $millions to the rich and corporations, and they will spend it on expensive toys, putting hundreds of wage-slaves to work making them.  In the case of the Golden Cellphone, it means a few dozen or so miner-elves won't get laid off.  Hooray for tax cuts!  Let's give even more to the rich, so we can all get jobs making toys for them!

Well atleast the phone won't be totally worthless in a few months due to changing technology, you can always melt it down or take it to a gold exchanger.  But as a cell phone it is worthless right out of the box, I'd rather have a Jitterbug cell than this.

Maybe it says something about our possible future; keep investing in gold cause most everything else is going to lose its value.

After what seemed like a lifetime of thirty-Year adjustable-rate mortgages, with monthly mortgage payments going up all the time, The "123 Refinance" helped me to lock in a great low fixed rate of 3.16%, helping me to guarantee myself the ability to always make my mortgage payment on time with money to spare.

$60,000 for a phone (possibly) made of about $500 worth of 'gold'. A "phone" that doesn't do anything but look 'good' when you pull it out of your pocket. Middle-eastern oil-tycoon trust fund babies will love that one.

If it had anywhere near $ 60,000  worth of  gold in it the thing would weigh nearly 4 pounds. its just cheap silicon and gold foil waiting for some rich idiot to get distracted by the sparkle long enough to process his credit card !

Isn't solid gold malleable? If exposed to too much heat wouldn't this phone malfunction? What's the point in blowing 60k on a phone that could get bent out of shape?

This phones are for stupid rich people. The total weight of the gold alone is definitely not worth that much. Just because the gold is incrusted on a out-of-date phone it is worth $60k. Just plain stupid. Only stupid rich people would fall for this.

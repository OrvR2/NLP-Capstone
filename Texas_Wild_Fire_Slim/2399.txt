VOLUNTARY IMPLEMENTATION OF FORESTRY BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN EAST TEXAS, ROUND 5 (2000-2002)









[ Print | 

 ]



Executive Summary
A Best Management Practices (BMP) monitoring program evaluated the level of implementation with voluntary forestry BMPs. A total of 150 sites on which silvicultural activities occurred were evaluated. These sites were monitored between August 16, 2000 and April 23, 2002 and are believed to be a representative sample of the forestry activities that occur in East Texas.
Overall BMP implementation on the sites monitored was 91.5%. In general, implementation was highest on sites under public or industrial ownership. National and State Forest sites had an overall implementation of 98.4%, while industry sites had a 96.1% implementation rating. Nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) lands scored 86.4% overall. 
Implementation with BMPs was statistically significantly higher when:

the landowner was familiar with BMPs
the logging contractor had attended formal BMP training
a forester was involved in the sale or activity
BMPs were included in the timber sale contract
the landowner was a member of a forest organization
the timber was delivered to a major SFISM mill

Implementation was generally lowest on sites when:

owned by nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) landowners
a forester was not involved in the sale or activity
BMPs were not included in the timber sale contract

Major deficiencies noted during the evaluations were:

improper stream crossings on temporary roads
high amount of significant risks 

Major improvements from previous rounds were:

higher overall BMP implementation on stream crossings and roads
increase in BMP implementation across all ownerships

In previous rounds (1, 2, and 3) of monitoring, tracts were graded for implementation using a “Pass or Fail” method. For Round 4, a new system was developed that uses percentages to denote implementation. This same system was used for Round 5.    Table 1.

WHEN SHOULD I PRUNE MY OAK TREES?









[ Print |

New oak wilt centers are started when a contaminated beetle finds a fresh wound on a healthy oak tree.

Insect populations in general increase during mild spring like weather and mild spring like weather is when fungal mats are most likely to form. So the most likely time a contaminated beetle will find your tree is when the weather is mild.

The best time to prune is when a contaminated beetle is least likely to find your tree. The heat of summer and the cold of winter are when the beetle populations are the lowest and fungal mats are least likely to form. Therefore that is the best time to prune to prevent against an oak wilt infection.

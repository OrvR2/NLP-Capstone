Lacey the alpaca is friends with all of the adult cats on her farm, so it makes sense that she'd get excited upon seeing her first kitten. Whether or not the kitten wants to snuggle with her is another story. 
Watch a fresh-out-of-her-first-haircut Lacey try (and sort of succeed) to nuzzle a very confused kitten below. And be sure to check out her awesome manicure.

				That was not a smart thing to do.

Llamas and Alpacas can turn at a moment's notice. They could kill a small kitten in a second or two, and they even try to eviscerate humans when they are being shorn. They try to kick a person across their abdominal midsection­.

				I agree, but most alpacas are more or less farm animals, and less pets.  Considerin­g the bright pink manicure and the cutesy name, I think this particular alpaca is a pet, and probably extremely well-socia­lized.  Plus, they said she was used to cats.  There might be a risk, but as much as she is around cats, she probably thinks it's a weird looking baby alpaca.

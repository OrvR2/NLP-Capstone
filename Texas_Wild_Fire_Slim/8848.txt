   Fresh Look for Concannon Selected Vineyards Wines - New Package Blends Tradition with InnovationPRWeb – 7 hrs ago





   After eight years, Concannon Selected Vineyards wines have a fresh, modern look with several new visual elements to capture the consumer's eye.  New packaging recognizes increasing quality of the wines in this tier.Livermore, CA (PRWEB) September 07, 2011  Concannon Vineyard today announced a beautiful new look for its Selected Vineyards tier.  The enhanced package has several new visual elements to capture the consumer’s eye such as the iconic Concannon gate incorporated into an elegant new one-piece label along with a signature Concannon Vineyard scene which hugs the bottom of each label. The new Concannon Selected Vineyards tier package also features a contemporary red stripe which highlights each varietal along with a stylish new capsule design; silver with red accents on the white wines and red with silver accents on the red wines. On the back label, a new QR code, devised to be read by smart phones, leads consumers to a virtual tasting of the wine narrated by John Concannon, fourth generation vintner.
"After eight years, it was time to give our Selected Vineyards package a fresh and more modern look that celebrates the past and embraces the future,” Concannon said.  "These well-loved varieties from our Selected Vineyards tier are crafted from carefully chosen Central Coast vineyards using traditional, time-honored techniques such as small-lot barrel fermentation and oak aging. The wines have never tasted better and the value in this tier is  remarkable,” Concannon stated.  
Selected Vineyards wines include Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Petite Sirah. The new package will be available in markets Q4 of 2011 with a suggested retail price of $10.00.
The winery’s website also received a complete makeover including a more user-friendly interface and improved e-commerce site.  The remodeled website features an enriched trade and media resources library as well as a beautifully curated gallery of  Concannon’s rich history  over the past 127 years.

One of the dozens of massive blazes that have torched rain-starved Texas was set by arsonists, police say.Cops in Leander are hunting for two teenage girls and two teenage boys suspected of starting a fire Monday night that gutted around a dozen houses and forced hundreds of people to evacuated their homes, KXAN television reported.The teens were spotted running through a wooded area where the fire started, police said.The city was offering up to $2,000 to anyone with information leading to the arrest of the arsonists.Local reports said the blaze ripped through at least 300 acres, destroyed 11 homes and damaged at least eight homes around Leander, about 22 miles northwest of Austin.Firefighters battling the blaze were said to have it 75% contained by late Tuesday, but around 500 people who were driven from their homes were still unable to return, KXAN reported.Investigators say one of girl suspects was wearing a pink shirt and blue jeans, and she had black hair that may have been dyed. The other girl was described as having dirty blond hair in a white T-shirt and jeans.PHOTOS: WILDFIRES IN TEXASBoth boys had dark, shaggy hair and were dressed in jeans, police said. All four teens are white, cops said.More than 150 different wildfires have ravaged hundreds of thousands of acres and destroyed more than 1,000 homes in Texas this week.One fire, in Bastrop, southeast of Austin, was described as the most devastating wildfire in more than a decade.That fire raged for a fourth-consecutive day on Wednesday, consuming 45 square miles and forcing 7,000 to evacuate the area.More than 600 homes were said to have been destroyed, and four people have been killed.The wildfires across the state have been largely blamed on a yearlong drought.Earlier this week, the flames were fanned by high winds driven by Tropical Storm Lee, which pummeled neighboring Louisiana over the weekend.The Texas Forest Service said Wednesday that calmer winds were expected to help firefighters contain the fire in Bastrop.With News Wire Services

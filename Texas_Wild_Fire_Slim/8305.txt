Lawyer: Van der Sloot should do more timeAP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011





LIMA, Peru (AP) — The family of the Peruvian woman who Joran van der Sloot is charged with killing believes the 30-year prison sentence sought by the prosecution is inadequate.But the family's lawyer tells The Associated Press that Stephany Flores' family won't object because it doesn't want the trial delayed.Van der Sloot is to appear Monday before a judge who could set the trial to begin as early as October.When arrested in the May 2010 slaying of Flores, Van der Sloot was widely known as the chief suspect in the unsolved disappearance five years earlier in Aruba of the U.S. teen Natalee Holloway.Lawyer Edward Alvarez says that if the Flores family were to raise objections Monday the trial could be delayed until next year.

There is power in Sloots family. Mark my words you snapperheads, this psychopath will be found NOT GUILTY in that backward nation. His father has political clout and believe you me will find his way into the judicial system there and undermine it.




 






Brian

Just be glad this isn't in California or Florida, he would be found innocent.

is he black? because white people don't do his kind of stuff...

No, this pervert should die. After he is tortured: drawn, and quartered then left his head to hang on a spike.

I am not a liberal.  I am all for the death penalty for people who commit horrible, violent crimes.  However, some of the comments here are worse than the crime they are against.  "Cut off pieces of him, draw and quarter him, etc."  Are you people insane?  The death penalty is not "let's have fun torturing the criminal" is is a swift, legitimate taking of the life of a person who has commited such a horrible crime that he has forfieted his right to continue to live.  It is a civilized society's way of carrying out justice.

Too bad he's not in Texas.

So let him do his 30 yrs in peruvian jail, and if he survives it: the day he steps out you're there waiting with a 50 cal sniper rifle.

30 years in a peruvian prison is a death sentence if you're white. if he makes it 5 years i'll be stunned




 






Michael

I'm sure, even in Peru, 30 years is not really 30 years.




 






Michael

So sad to read all this anger. Remember, when you cry for revenge - dig two graves. Man may never forgive him but, if he repents, Jesus will.

Prison hasn't been bad for this guy so far.  His Brazilian girlfriend is now pregnant by him according to Brazilian press.

30 years at a cost of $2.4 million per year (current costs).
You'll never guess what I'm thinking!

Just cut off his johnson and jewel bag, put a life jacket on him and set him afloat in shark infested waters.

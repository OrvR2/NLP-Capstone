‘Smells like Nirvana.’


Smells Like Nirvana, Weird Al Yankovic
One of his top five, I think.

Book of the Week: Ghosts of Manhattan.

Alt-earth steampunk pulp superhero noir: Ghosts of Manhattan isn’t out until the end of April, but I know my weaknesses.  I mean, I’ve seen Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow something like four times*.
And so, adieu to The Little Red Hen… actually, no.  I want to reinforce that particular message.

*The wife almost stood up and cheered when we saw the robots for the first time.  Apparently Hollywood is very, very bad at making believable robots, from a roboticist’s point of view…

Have a couple of glasses of wine…

…before perusing this site:
Peter Scolari: Unsung Genius.
It improves the critical WTF? ambiance.
Moe Lane
PS: My wife: “It just goes to show: not every alternate history particularly needs to be explored.”

This Guardian article on the Falklands situation is not exactly illogical. #rsrh

It’s merely not based on Aristotelian logic.  I mean, when something starts like this:
If some supreme being could give British leftists of my generation the power to go back and stop one historical event, I have no doubt that we would rewind the tape and wipe out the Falklands war. Before General Galtieri’s fascistic junta invaded the islands Margaret Thatcher had no “-ism” after her name. She seemed a doomed prime minister surrounded by enemies, whose party was third in the polls behind the SDP, a political force I suspect many young readers have never heard of. After Britain’s victory, nothing could stop her and by the time she had finished, British socialism was dead, and the prospects for British social democracy did not seem much healthier.
…you would assume that we’re about to hear some solemn pontificating on how the UK needs to mediate its dispute with Argentina.  Not so much: the title is “Obama should back our claim to the Falklands,” and the author is calling the President a neoconservative for not siding with the Brits.
No, really. (more…)

Ah, so *that’s* why the new WH social secretary.

It’s been long enough to ease out Desiree Rogers and put in the person that the administration really wanted: a stone-cold moneymaker.
The promotion of Julianna Smoot to White House Social Secretary is good news for wealthy donors to President Obama’s campaign, for whom Smoot — the chief campaign fundraiser — is friend and point of contact.
Smoot, who had been working in the relative obscurity of the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, will now be the key gatekeeper to the kind of social functions from which donors have complained that this administration, unlike President Clinton’s, has barred them.
(Via Hot Air Headlines) Ben Smith went on to write that this choice ‘cuts against’ existing administration rhetoric on access and accessibility; I would be interested to see the expression on his face as he wrote that bit of understatement.  Of course, I imagine that Ben no more believes that the White House meant any of that agitprop than I did, so he might have even have written the line out with a straight face.  At any rate: business is business, and the White House… is back in business.
Moe Lane
PS: Administration response? The usual way that they handle any criticism of the administration: they blamed Bush. Except, of course, that Lea Berman was VP Cheney’s social secretary before she worked on the 2004 campaign.  In contrast, Julianna Smoot’s resume says ‘finance director’ a lot.

Keli Carender & the faintest whiff of panic from the NYT.  #rsrh

(H/T: Instapundit) The first paragraph sets the mood:
Keli Carender has a pierced nose, performs improv on weekends and lives here in a neighborhood with more Mexican grocers than coffeehouses. You might mistake her for the kind of young person whose vote powered President Obama to the White House. You probably would not think of her as a Tea Party type.
…and the Old Grey Lady pretty clearly was not in it.  They didn’t do a bad job of reporting this story, but very little of it fits their existing narrative of the Tea Party, and you can tell that the writer was somewhat aware of that. (more…)

Time travelers, please contact me.

After listening to the trailer for Happily N’Ever After for the ten millionth time (the older child loves his Clifford the Big Red Dog DVDs), I am prepared to pay quite handsomely in mint action figures or placing sports bets or depositing pennies in bank accounts* to have this, this, this thing eradicated from the time stream once and for all.  I refuse to believe that said eradication will be anything except a unambiguous benefit to history.
Moe Lane
PS: Dear sweet merciful Jesus, but they made a sequel.  Why, God?  WHY?
*Or whatever it is that time travelers do to generate income from the past that doesn’t hurt anybody.

CPAC 2010: Rep Rob Bishop (R, UT-01).

This CPAC interview with Rep. Rob Bishop (R, UT-01) seemed relevant, given the post that I did earlier on the White House gutting 23K space-reliant jobs in a politically-unreliable Democrat’s Congressional District:

Rep. Bishop is active in space issues, and in fact went into greater detail recently about why said gutting is ill-advised.  The op-ed is well worth reading, if probably not making an argument that’s unfamiliar to my likely readers…

Obama administration kills 23K space-related jobs in Florida.

So they can spend that money right here on Earth:
Revised projections now show that about 23,000 workers at and around Kennedy Space Center will lose their jobs because of the shuttles’ retirement and the new proposal to cancel the development of new rockets and spacecraft.
That sum includes 9,000 “direct” space jobs and — conservatively speaking — 14,000 “indirect” jobs at hotels, restaurants, retail stores and others that depend on activity at the space center, said Lisa Rice, Brevard Workforce president.
…(via Geraghty) more accurately, so that they can spend that money right here on Earth, and in districts that aren’t R+4 and that aren’t represented by a Democrat who voted against health care rationing.  I mean, seriously: they would have eventually killed the space program anyway.  But being able to do it in a way that would get maximum revenge against an apostate?  That’s just gravy.
Moe Lane
PS: You know, if we absolutely had to elect a Democrat President, it’s a darn shame that we didn’t at least elect the one who said (bolding mine):
“We cannot cede our leadership in space. That’s why I will help close the gap and ensure that our space program doesn’t suffer when the Shuttle goes out of service by working with Senator Bill Nelson to add at least one additional Space Shuttle flight beyond 2010; by supporting continued funding for NASA; by speeding the development of the Shuttle’s successor; and by making sure that all those who work in the space industry in Florida do not lose their jobs when the Shuttle is retired – because we cannot afford to lose their expertise.”
Oh, wait.  We did.
PPS: I had a nice chat with Republican FL-24 candidate Tom Garcia at CPAC, including some discussion of space issues.  Just saying.

Galaxy Quest in my head today.

Dunno why: but the bit with Alan Rickman was really good.

Then again, there were just a lot of good bits in this section of Galaxy Quest.

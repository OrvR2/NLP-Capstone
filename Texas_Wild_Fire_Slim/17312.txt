		HOUSTON -- Wells Fargo & Company said today the company is contributing $100,000 to the American Red Cross, to support the Texas wildfire disaster relief and recovery efforts in Texas. Wells Fargo's donation to the American Red Cross disaster relief fund will support ongoing efforts in responding to local emergency situations, most recently highlighted by the heavy wildfire destruction in Bastrop and Travis counties. "Were reaching out to help our team members, neighbors, friends, customers, and their families who have been affected by these wildfires", said Chip Carlisle, Southwest Region President for Wells Fargo. "Were also committed to helping our community recover from the destruction, and we will do our part to help families and business owners return to their homes and daily routines, especially when customers and team members may face a difficult recovery."Effectively immediately, Wells Fargo customers can donate to the American Red Cross at over 1,000 Wells Fargo ATMs in Texas. Customers will not be charged a fee for using this service and 100 percent of the donations will be sent to the American Red Cross, for Texas wildfire disaster relief.

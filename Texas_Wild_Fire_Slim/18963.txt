1-2-8, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
This one was recommended, and I’m still trying to decide if I like it.

#rsrh On tonight’s Iraq speech.

I was going to put this up at RedState, but was pre-empted, alas.  So here’s my question:

Does anybody expect him to come clean and admit that he was wrong on the surge, and that George W Bush was right?
And if he does, what does that say?
And if he does not, then what does that say?

#rsrh Today’s straight line…

…comes to us, courtesy of Slate’s John Dickerson.  He’s (very gingerly) writing about how President Obama’s now learning that, hey, maybe it was easier to criticize President Bush than it is to do a better job than him – no, really – and in the process Dickerson lets off this line:
As he benefits from policies he once opposed—such as the surge in Iraq,  which helped make tomorrow’s speech possible—Obama proves that even a  smart politician with the best of intentions can be wrong.
Indeed.  And if one of those can be wrong, imagine how badly our current President can screw things up.
Thanks, I’m here all week.  Remember to tip your waitress!

#rsrh Helping Baldilocks out.

She’s an Old School blogger (veteran, too), and she’s got a book out, and she would really find it helpful if people bought it.  Amazon link here: note that I think that I’ve set up the link so that she gets the referral fees, not me.  Least I can do: my cash flow is… not even worth mentioning, in this context.

John Callahan (D CAND, PA-15) Question video surfaces.

People may remember that back in July a report came out asking what role Democratic candidate John Callahan (mayor of Bethlehem, PA) had in the investigation of a 2007 Superbowl weekend car accident involving Callahan’s brother-in-law Dino Cantelmi.  The accident involved Cantelmi going down the wrong way on a one-way street and smacking into a police cruiser, sending the patrolman in it to the hospital; alcohol was involved, as was a ‘female companion.’  No sobriety check at the station, no felony charges, no follow-up investigation; and apparently it took three years to finally get the incident report and photos of the event.
But they are available now, and somebody put a video in together in response, and I got my hands on it:

Now, it may not seem nice to ask whether the current Democratic candidate for PA-15 is involved in any of this; but it’s certainly fair.  I’m pretty sure that if I flipped my female companion’s car after smacking into a police cruiser because I was going the wrong way on an one-way street during Superbowl weekend, and I put a cop in the hospital, and I had been drinking… well.  I’d need a mayor brother-in-law to make that go away. (more…)

#rsrh Says it all, really.

From the Left’s pro forma counter-protest against Glenn Beck’s honoring of MLK Saturday:

Are you shocked that the Purple People Beaters can’t even spell “American?”  You are?  Really?  Cool.  I miss that level of innocence, sometimes.
Via Ed Driscoll, and that’s not even the best facepalm over there.

Sebelius counsels… ‘Reeducation’ for Obamacare.

The young boy’s desperately silent scream for rescue will haunt your dreams.
“Reeducation.”
Reeducation.
Yeah, sure, using that term will save at-risk Democrats in swing seats and states.
Now, it’s important to note here that HHS Secretary Sebelius was being inarticulate and stupidly insensitive here, not threatening.  She didn’t mean to evoke the Cold War era specter of Communist concentration camps where enemies of the State were systematically tortured into reflexively supporting whatever Dear Leader was in power that year, or Soviet-era ‘mental hospitals’ where dissidence was ‘treated’ as a medical disease.  The Democrats aren’t setting up detention centers for everybody who opposes Obamacare: for one thing, you can’t actually lock up a majority of a country.  But the Democrats are nonetheless tired and angry about how Obamacare continues to be rejected by the voting populace – particularly the voting populace who will be at the polls in November – and sometimes people like Sebelius slip up.  Use of a term like ‘reeducation’ indicates that the user of it has decided that there’s nothing wrong with his or her argument; the flaw lies in whoever is not being persuaded by it.  So there’s no need to fix the argument itself, obviously. (more…)

#rsrh A helpful self-reminder.

When I read yet another article that uses faulty argumentation, bad assumptions, and/or obsolete data to come to the conclusion that no DOOM looms for the Democrats this November, I have to remember… I must let them do this and not interfere.
But it’s hard.
Oh, so hard.

AUSTIN (KXAN) - Thousands of homes are gone, and the families that lived in them needed our help. KXAN teamed up with Walmart and the Salvation Army to support our community. As the wildfires all around central Texas continue, KXAN,  The Salvation Army  and Walmart held a two-day donation drive to help the disaster victims last weekend.  Note: Monetary donations are  still being accepted.  However, there is no longer a need for goods. "The outpouring of love and generosity from Austin -- what a wonderful thing and what a wonderful display,” said Capt. Mike Morton of The Salvation Army. “But you can also see that it’s overwhelming. We have a lot of stuff!...And we don’t need any more material goods so we appreciate everything but monetary donations are still being collected and accepted but right now we’ve got more than enough stuff. “Thank you very much, we want to tell everyone thank you for giving but look at this, we’ve got a ton of it," he said.     »  Read Jim Swift's story on the relief efforts   All of the money raised and items donated will go directly to provide for the disaster victims and the relief workers. On Tuesday, Salvation Army officials said they will begin to distribute to fire victims items that they need from the donated stock from the warehouse as  12317 Technology Blvd., #300, in Austin. People who have lost their homes are asked to bring proof of residence in order to qualify for assistance, such as driver's license, utility bill -- anything that matches them to a list of addresses that the Salvation Army was provided by officials.  The warehouse will be open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. starting Friday for distribution. "Walmart and its associates are proud to serve the communities in which we live and work, said Matt Welch,” market manager for Walmart Stores. “We hope this partnership with KXAN and the Salvation Army will help bring some relief to our neighbors and associates impacted by this fire.”    View  Walmart drop-off sites  in a larger map  Addresses of the Walmart stores that participated:  12900 N.

However, the  Bastrop Ministerial Alliance said Monday  appliances and furniture will be needed soon, as the families return to their homes and assess what they no longer have. A list will later be provided to the public, asking for donations of household goods.  Make checks payable to: Salvation Army/ Firestorm TX, PO Box 36607, Dallas, TX 75235.

The warehouse will be open Monday to Saturday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and begin processing items on Wednesday morning.  Some of the totals More than 20 pallets of donated items were collected.

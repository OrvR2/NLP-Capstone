4 terror suspects interrogated in Sweden



7:43 AM

 Four terror suspects arrested over the weekend in Sweden's second-largest city are being questioned and remain under suspicion of preparing a terror attack, prosecutors said Monday.

Authorities are being tightlipped about the arrests in the west coast city of Goteborg, which came on the eve of the 9/11 anniversary, and were followed by the evacuation of about 400 people from an arts center.

The Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement that investigation leader Agnetha Hilding Qvarnstrom must decide by Tuesday whether to release the suspects, or seek court approval to keep them in custody.

Prosecutors and police won't say whether the suspects are suspected of links to Islamist terror groups or other extremist networks. The prosecutors' statement said they were arrested without incident and noted that "the investigation is still in an early stage."

Ulf Ahlstedt, who has been appointed as defense lawyer for one of the suspects, said his client denies the allegations, but declined to give any other details.

"What I can say is that he's a man and he is suspected of preparation to commit a terrorist offense, which he denies," Ahlstedt told The Associated Press.

Sweden's security service SAPO said the Goteborg police and a national police anti-terror unit were involved in the arrests Saturday.

Goteborg police said they had evacuated the Roda Sten arts center, located beneath the city's landmark half-mile (930-meter) Alvsborg bridge, because of a threat deemed to pose "serious danger to life, health or substantial damage of property."

The Alvsborg bridge runs over Goteborg's harbor to connect the mainland with the island of Hisingen. The six-lane passage is a vital link from the Norwegian capital Oslo to southern Sweden.

SAPO wouldn't specify the target of the alleged plot, but said after the arrests that there was no reason for public concern and maintained its terror alert at "elevated." It has remained at that level since being raised from "low" in October.

Swedish tabloid Expressen, citing an unnamed police source, said investigators suspect the men belong to a terror network with links to al-Qaida, and that they had acquired, or were trying to acquire, firearms, explosives and hand grenades. Security police declined to comment on the newspaper's information.

Once peaceful Scandinavia is no longer insulated from terrorism. Danish authorities have foiled a series of plots against a newspaper that printed caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in 2005, sparking riots in Muslim countries.

In December, suicide bomber Taimour Abdulwahab blew himself up in downtown Stockholm among panicked Christmas shoppers, injuring two people and causing shock in a country that had largely been insulated from terrorism.

On July 22, a self-styled anti-Muslim extremist blew up a car bomb in downtown Oslo and then massacred youth gathered for a Labor Party summer camp, killing 77 people in the region's worst violence since World War II.

Lawyer 'gave Chirac and Villepin $20 mn from Africa'



7:39 AM
  cnetwork
  No comments







A lawyer with ties to African leaders declared on Monday he had personally handed over $20 million in cash to French former president Jacques Chirac and his close ally Dominique de Villepin.

Robert Bourgi said in an interview with Europe 1 radio the money came from several presidents of France's former African colonies, and was handed over to the centre-right politicians in stages between 1995 and 2005.

Insisting he was coming forward now because he wanted a "clean France", Bourgi said the system of kickbacks had also existed under former presidents Georges Pompidou, Valerie Giscard d'Estaing and Francois Mitterrand.

He said he could not estimate how much had been handed over before he became directly involved, but could speak about the deliveries he said he had made to Chirac's office when he was mayor of Paris and later to Villepin.

"I'd estimate at around $20 million what I handed to Mr Chirac and to Dominique de Villepin," he told Europe 1, fleshing out the detail of claims he had already made in a newspaper interview that appeared on Sunday.

The allegations, which were furiously denied by Chirac and Villepin, come just seven months before France's presidential election, in which President Nicolas Sarkozy could face a Villepin challenge from within the right.

Bourgi is widely reported to be close to Sarkozy, but insisted in the interview that he was neither an official nor unofficial advisor to the president, simply someone who was sometimes consulted for an opinion.

Chirac and Villepin have said they will lodge lawsuits against Bourgi.

Global stocks hit hard by Greek worries



7:37 AM
  cnetwork
  No comments





World shares tumbled nearly 2 percent on Monday with European equities at 26-month lows, down more than 20 percent this year, as investors worried Greece would default amid signs of rifts among euro zone policymakers.

Japan's Nikkei closed at a 2-1/2 year low.

Yields on long-term core euro zone debt, home to safety plays during times of strife, fell sharply and the euro slumped against the dollar and yen.

The cost of insuring peripheral euro zone debt against default rose, to record levels for Greece and Portugal.

Markets were partly reacting to the failure over the weekend of the Group of Seven industrialized nations' finance ministers to come up with more than a stated commitment to help turn the world economy around.

But they were mainly focused on the euro zone debt crisis.

"Europe is not just lurching from one crisis to another. It is lurching into a new one before the previous one is solved," said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst was down 2.6 percent.

German policymaker Juergen Stark's resignation from the European Central Bank's board on Friday underscored internal divisions over its bond-buying program -- one of the bank's main weapons in fighting the debt crisis, by forcing down yields on debt of countries under pressure from the bond markets.

At the same time, worries bubbled up again over Greece's ability to meet commitments to qualify for more bailout money.

Fears about a Greek default rose last week after senior politicians in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right coalition started talking openly about it. Greece, meanwhile, confirmed on Monday that the country has cash for only a few more weeks.

International lenders threatened last week to withhold the sixth bailout payment of about 8 billion euros ($11 billion) because of the country's repeated fiscal slippage.

The Greek government announced on Sunday a new property tax to make sure it would meet its budget targets and qualify for the tranche.

"The Greek situation is dominant, chances of some sort of default have increased -- the Germans seem to be hinting at that," one bond trader in Europe said.

EURO SINKS

The euro dived to a seven-month low against the U.S. dollar and a 10-year trough versus the yen.

"The outlook for Greece is almost completely unknown. Support for the country appears to be shaking. The market is starting to think the worst could happen," said Katsunori Kitakura, chief dealer at Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking.

"It's as if policymakers are starting to prepare for that," Kitakura said.

The euro fell as low as $1.34949, its lowest since February.

On bond markets, Italian and Spanish government bond yields rose, feeling the pressure of upcoming debt supply and the rising concern over Greece.

Algeria to recognize new Libyan government



5:58 AM
  cnetwork
  No comments





Algeria says it will officially recognize the revolutionary forces' National Transitional Council as being in control of Libya once it forms a new government.

Algeria was close to deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and has been a lone holdout among Arab countries in recognizing the council.

Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci said late Sunday at a press conference with his Malian counterpart that he was awaiting the formation of a government "representing Libyans of all tendencies."

Relations between the former rebels, who now control all but three cities in the oil-rich North African nation, have been strained with Algeria, especially after it gave refuge to Gadhafi's wife, daughter and two of his sons.

Medelci added that contacts have improved between the two countries over the last two weeks.

Iran hangs five drug traffickers

Iran on Monday hanged five convicted drug traffickers jailed in the central city of Shahroud, the Fars news agency reported.

The report did not identify those executed.

The latest hanging brings to 192 the number of executions reported in Iran so far this year, according to an AFP tally based on media and official reports.

Iranian media reported 179 hangings last year but international human rights groups say the actual number was much higher, ranking the Islamic republic second only to China in the number of people it executed in 2010.

Tehran says the death penalty is essential to maintain law and order, and that it is applied only after exhaustive judicial proceedings.

Murder, rape, armed robbery, drug trafficking and adultery are among the crimes punishable by death in Iran.

5 dead in southeast Turkey after Kurdish attacks



5:14 AM
  cnetwork
  No comments





Kurdish rebels attacked a police station and a paramilitary police headquarters near Turkey's border with Iraq, killing five people, including three civilians, the region's governor said Monday.

The Kurdish rebels, who are fighting for autonomy from Turkey, have stepped up attacks on Turkey's military and police, killing dozens of security forces since July, but this was the first civilians deaths in the conflict in recent months.

Turkey responded to the escalated attacks with air raids on suspected rebel positions in northern Iraq last month.

Gov. Muammer Turker said three civilians, a police officer and a soldier died late Sunday after the guerrillas opened fire on the two buildings in the town of Semdinli. The town is located in the mainly Kurdish province of Hakkari, which borders Iraq.

Ten other people, most of them soldiers, were injured in the raids by members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, he said.

The pro-Kurdish Firat news agency, however, said the civilians were killed by shots fired by the police and said the dead included a 14-year-old. The agency, which is close to the rebels, did not cite a source.

Turker said the military immediately launched an operation to catch the rebels, which the private Dogan news agency said was being backed with attack helicopters.

Dogan said the attack touched off a two-hour-long clash with the security forces and that the civilians died in the crossfire.

Video footage from Dogan showed people at an open-air wedding near one of the buildings that came under attack running and huddling for safety amid gunshots. None of the wedding guests appeared hurt.

The PKK, which has been designated as a terror organization by the United States and the European Union, is fighting for autonomy in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast region, often using bases in northern Iraq for attacks in Turkey. Tens of thousands of people have died in the conflict since 1984.

Meanwhile, a U.S. official said Sunday that Turkey and the United States were discussing how to keep cooperating against terrorist targets in northern Iraq after U.S. forces leave Iraq in December, including the possibility of basing U.S. Predator drones in Turkey.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

The U.S. currently is sharing Predator surveillance data with Turkey as part of a joint effort to combat the PKK. The Predators, capable of transmitting video, are flow from bases in Iraq.

Tropical Storm Maria moving away from NE Caribbean



5:12 AM
  cnetwork
  No comments





Tropical Storm Maria is moving away from the northeastern Caribbean islands with little change in strength forecast.

Maria's maximum sustained winds early Monday are near 60 mph (95 kph).

The storm is centered about 165 miles (270 kilometers) north of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and is moving northwest near 9 mph (15 kph).

The U.S. National Hurricane Center says the storm's center is expected to pass well east of the southeastern Bahamas. Maria's forecast track shows it eventually curving away from the U.S.

Meanwhile, rescuers have been searching for an oil rig worker who's been missing since he and nine other workers evacuated their disabled rig during Tropical Storm Nate in the Gulf of Mexico last week. Seven workers were found alive Sunday. Two bodies have also been found.

Pro-Gaddafi forces put up stiff resistance



5:10 AM
  cnetwork
  No comments







Forces of Libya's new rulers met "ferocious" street-by-street resistance during an assault on one of the last bastions loyal to Muammar Gaddafi, but were edging toward the ousted ruler's birthplace of Sirte.

The National Transitional Council's forces, which toppled Gaddafi last month, said they were facing about 1,000 loyalist fighters in the Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid, far more than the 100 to 150 men they had estimated earlier, while discipline had slipped in their own ranks.

Residents fleeing Bani Walid reported intense street fighting, while NATO warplanes could be heard overhead.

"There has been a ferocious resistance from them at Bani Walid. I don't know how long it's going to take (to capture it)," NTC spokesman Jalil al-Galal told Reuters on Sunday.

Southern neighbor Niger said one of the fugitive former leader's sons, Saadi Gaddafi, had turned up there after crossing the remote Sahara desert frontier.

The NTC, which is trying to exert its control over all of Libya three weeks after its fighters stormed Tripoli, promised to unveil a new, more inclusive government in seven to 10 days.

It also said it had begun producing oil, Libya's economic lifeblood, output of which had been all but halted throughout six months of civil war. In Tripoli, NTC fighters revealed they had captured Gaddafi's foreign spy chief.

The NTC says it will not declare Libya "liberated" until it has taken control of towns still in the hands of Gaddafi loyalists. It had given those towns a deadline of Saturday to surrender and its fighters have been battling since Friday inside Bani Walid, 150 km (95 miles) southeast of the capital.

They said they were meeting tougher resistance than expected in Bani Walid, but were advancing toward Sirte, which sits on the main east-west coast road, effectively cutting Libya in two.

NTC troops said the front line was about 90 km east of Sirte. Firing from tanks, howitzers and heavy machineguns could be heard above the roar of NATO warplanes overhead.

"Gaddafi forces were firing Grad rockets, but we managed to advance a little bit and we will enter Sirte very soon," fighter Salah al-Shaery said.

The interim government has sent additional brigades to Bani Walid, but some fighters on the ground said the move had only worsened existing tribal sensitivities.

"Locals don't listen to NTC commanders," said one fighter, Esam Herebish. "They do what they like. They want to be seen as the city's liberators."

Families trapped inside Bani Walid for weeks fled the besieged town on Monday after Gaddafi forces abandoned some checkpoints on the edge of the city. Dozens of cars packed with civilians streamed out of the area.

Residents described scenes of intense street-to-street fighting, saying that Gaddafi forces were shelling residential areas to stop NTC fighters from advancing.

One man driving out of Bani Walid in a car packed with women and children said they were fleeing fierce fighting in the town.

"We are leaving because of the rockets. They are falling near civilian homes," Ali Hussain said.

One NTC commander, Mohamed el-Fassi, said troops sent to reinforce the anti-Gaddafi onslaught from elsewhere in Libya had actually made advances difficult.

"When we entered Bani Walid, Gaddafi forces started firing rockets in residential areas, targeting our fighters," he said, adding that some had advanced into the town without orders to do so, contributing to their lack of progress on the front line.

"Our fighters are from all over Libya. There was little control over them yesterday. Today we will control them better," he said, adding that five NTC fighters were killed and 14 wounded in Sunday's clashes.

Fighters trying to take the town also said they suspected local fighters of the Warfalla tribe, Libya's largest, of passing information to pro-Gaddafi forces inside Bani Walid.

"We believe there are traitors among them," said Mohammed el Gahdi, a fighter from the coastal city of Khoms.

NTC military spokesman Ahmed Bani told reporters the plan for Bani Walid for now was to wait.

"When our forces entered Bani Walid they found the brigades of Gaddafi using citizens as shields," he told reporters. He said Gaddafi fighters had put missile launchers on the roofs of houses with civilian families inside, making it impossible for NTC forces or their allied NATO warplanes to strike.

SON FLEES

The justice minister of Niger said Gaddafi's son Saadi had been intercepted in a convoy after crossing the frontier, heading toward the oasis town of Agadez. Two of Gaddafi's other sons, Mohammed and Hannibal, and his only daughter Aisha have already obtained shelter in Algeria.

Three sons remain at large -- Mutassim and Khamis, who both run elite military units, and Saif al-Islam, Gaddafi's one-time heir apparent who, like his father, is wanted for war crimes by the international court in the Hague. One son, Saif al-Arab, was reported killed during the war.

Asked about Saadi Gaddafi's status, Justice Minister Marou Adamou said only that Niger would fulfil its humanitarian obligations. Western powers have pressed Libya's neighbors not to shelter Gaddafi himself or officials wanted for crimes.

The NTC, based for months in the eastern city of Benghazi, faces the difficult task of winning the support of all Libyans, including fighters from towns and cities in the west who did the bulk of the fighting in the rapid advance on Tripoli.

The interim government also has to deliver on promises to quickly restart an economy frozen by international sanctions, the halt in oil production and an exodus of foreign workers.

In Tripoli, Reuters reporters saw Bouzaid Dorda, a former prime minister who ran Gaddafi's external spy service, held by a group of about 20 fighters in a house in the Zenata district.

A lanky figure in safari jacket and slip-on shoes, Dorda was sitting on a sofa and was not physically restrained, but an armed guard sat beside him. He declined a request for an interview, but in response to an assertion by a fighter that he had killed people, he replied: "Prove it."

The United Nations says it is worried about the fate of civilians trapped inside the besieged pro-Gaddafi bastions.

"Our big concern right now is Sirte, where we are receiving reports that there's no water and no electricity," U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos told Reuters in an interview.

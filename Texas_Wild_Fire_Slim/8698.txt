This news story is wrong.   ALU (NYSE) fell 6.84% and is not listed.   Is nothing reliable anymore?

Digital government will end the stock market as we know it because we all will have a say in what is getting investor money. No more pie in the sky business models. No more anti trust moves and consolidations under the lie it is good for the consumer because it hasen't been good. search gerald krug

Where is Obama?  Getting ready for his vacation while the economy falls apart.  He is truly the flim-flam man or empty suit -- speaks well with a teleprompter but has no clue about anything else.  Why is he waiting until after his vacation to do something.  Americans need his help and that of Congress NOW!

Bring on the sell off.  I love buying stock at bargain basement prices.  My daddy always said when everyone else is selling, you best be buying with whatever cash you can scrape together and when everyone else is buying just keep counting all the money you've already made and keep doing your dollar cost average thing each month.  And you know what?  Daddy was right.

I invested my money at the tables in Las Vegas. I ended up in the same economic situation I would have been in If I had put it all in the stock markets, but it was I, not some suczball stockbroker, who had fun losing my money.

The U.S. stock markets are no way measures of how well (poorly) the US economy is doing.  Value of stocks are a combination of speculators' hopes and value of companies who manufacture in foreign countries, import foreign goods, register as U.S. companies.

In short, the U.S. stock markets are a measure of how well certain sectors or economies in China, India, and a few third world countries are doing...most with money from U.S. purchasers of goods and services not produced in the U.S.

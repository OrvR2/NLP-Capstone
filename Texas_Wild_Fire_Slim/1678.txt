GENEVA — The U.S. has tumbled further down a global ranking of the world's most competitive economies, landing at fifth place because of its huge deficits and declining public faith in government, a global economic group said Wednesday.
The announcement by the World Economic Forum was the latest bad news for the Obama administration, which has been struggling to boost the sinking U.S. economy and lower an unemployment rate of more than 9 percent.
Switzerland held onto the top spot for the third consecutive year in the annual ranking by the Geneva-based forum, which is best known for its exclusive meeting of luminaries in Davos, Switzerland, each January.
Singapore moved up to second place, bumping Sweden down to third. Finland moved up to fourth place, from seventh last year. The U.S. was in fourth place last year, after falling from No. 1 in 2008.
The rankings, which the forum has issued for more than three decades, are based on economic data and a survey of 15,000 business executives.
The forum praised the U.S. for its productivity, highly sophisticated and innovative companies, excellent universities and flexible labor market. But it also cited "a number of escalating weaknesses" such as rising government debt and declining public faith in political leaders and corporate ethics.
The results of a survey of 142 nations comes a day before Obama is preparing to tackle jobs issues in a speech to the U.S. Congress, and just as U.S. polls show a clear majority of those surveyed say they disapprove of the way Obama is handling the economy.
Switzerland held onto its top ranking, the forum said, because of "continuing strong performance across the board" with innovation, technological readiness, even-handed regulation and having one of the world's most stable economic environments.
Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, was sixth, followed by the Netherlands and Denmark. Japan came in ninth, and Britain was 10th. France was 18th, and Greece, saddled with debt, fell to 90th.
 The report looked at broader trends: While the U.S. slipped, emerging markets gained traction. China took 26th place, highest among major emerging economies; Brazil was 53rd; India was 56th; and Russia was 66th.
"Fiscal imbalances that have been building up around the world are really a danger to future competitiveness, in terms of the ability of countries to invest in those things that will be very important for competitiveness going forward, things like education, infrastructure and so on," said Jennifer Blanke, an economist with the forum.

				T.R.Reid, correspond­ent and author of "The Healing of America" , hosted a one-hour PBS show, "Sick Around the World", comparing the health care systems of the U.S., Britain, Switzerlan­d, Germany, Taiwan, and Japan. It's available for viewing at:

"...(pp. 13-14):

The academics have a term for this approach to problem-so­lving: "comparati­ve policy analysis." The patron saint of comparativ­e policy analysis was an American military hero who went on to become our thirty-fou­rth president: Dwight D. Eisenhower­. That's why this book is dedicated to his memory..."

				Wikipedia - 

In 2003, while the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, Frank opposed a Bush administra­tion proposal, in response to accounting scandals, for transferri­ng oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from Congress and the Department of Housing and Urban Developmen­t to a new agency that would be created within the Treasury Department­. The proposal, supported by the head of Fannie Mae, reflected the administra­tion's belief that Congress "neither has the tools, nor the stature" for adequate oversight. Frank stated, "These two entities ...are not facing any kind of financial crisis ... The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing."  In 2003, Frank also stated what has been called his "famous dice roll": "I do not want the same kind of focus on safety and soundness [in the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac] that we have in the Office of the Comptrolle­r of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervisio­n. I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation towards subsidised housing."

				I wrote earlier why should we care about being 5th? The top four are socialist and are a fraction of the size of the US. Several people assumed from those 2 lines I was some teabagging h@ter of socialism and all things good and friendly. 

I ask again why should we care if we are 5th. Does that make us any less a nation? The top for have socialized medicine and are smaller which puts them at a significan­t advantage to us.

				You are extremely misinforme­d.  I speak directly with Canadians about such matters.  Here is what one conservati­ve Canadian columnist has to say about Canadian health care:

Jones Forest Conservation Center

[ Printer Friendly | Back
																			 ]




In 1926, a tract of forestland was purchased in Montgomery County by the State of Texas to establish a research/demonstration area in what was the heart of one of the richest timber producing areas for the state. Today, the Jones State Forest remains one of the last forested open spaces in the Greater Houston Area. Located just 40 miles north of downtown Houston and situated adjacent to The Woodlands Community, this 1700 acre forest provides habitat for many wildlife species, and a unique opportunity for urban residents and over 1 million local K-12 (kindergarten through 12th grade) students to interact with a natural forest environment.
The Texas Forest Service proposes to create a world class Conservation & Education Center located in the Jones Forest. The Center would provide K-12 students, families, and research scientists the opportunity to learn through interactive experiences within a forest environment.
Opportunities for forestry, conservation, environmental, history, and human health education and research abound within the Jones Forest. Furthermore, with an ever-increasing population in nearby communities, the forest could provide family and community recreational experiences. All of these opportunities would be enhanced by locating a Conservation & Education Center and interpretive nature trails within the Jones Forest.

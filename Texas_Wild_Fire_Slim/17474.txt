 Michael Stravato for The New York Times


 Ken and Bettye Porterfield learned Wednesday that their home was one of 243 confirmed destroyed in a fire.


 BASTROP, Tex. — It was one simple line of text, one out of 243: 112 South Buckhorn Drive. Bettye Porterfield found it on Wednesday as she ran her finger over a piece of paper taped to a window. She and her husband, Ken, had lived at that address for nearly nine years — they called it their little cottage in the pines — but now her home was gone. The list made it official.

 The wildfire has blackened 45 square miles in and around Bastrop, Texas.


 Tears welled up in her eyes as she turned from the list attached to the windows of the Bastrop convention center. Her husband put his arm around her shoulders. The quilt his mother had made by hand, the Bible that had been in his family for generations, the coconut carved up like an owl that their daughter had given him — they lost all of it.


 “When you see it in writing, it kind of makes it more real,” said Ken Porterfield, 73.


 The scale of the disaster that has devastated this Central Texas town of 7,200 can be measured in absence. Texas Kiln Products, a lumber mill at the edge of Bastrop State Park, is gone, and so are 116 Nugget Lane and 256 Kelley Road and 112 Timberline Lane and 259 Cattlemens Drive and 101 North Mockingbird Lane. “It’s all surreal,” said Deborah Shelton, 63, whose husband and brother-in-law owned Texas Kiln Products, which specialized in native Texas woods. “Everybody’s saying that and it’s true. I feel like I’m watching this on a television show or a movie, because I haven’t actually touched the ground where the ashes are.”


 On Wednesday, firefighters were able to beat back some of the flames of the most destructive wildfire in the history of Texas — a 24-mile-long blaze in Bastrop County that has killed two people, burned 34,356 acres and destroyed 576 homes since it started Sunday afternoon. But for many residents what should been the fourth day of the fire was really the first: County officials released a list of the houses that they have confirmed have been destroyed so far.


 Shortly before 11 a.m. Wednesday, the list — 12 sheets of paper taped into a large rectangle, with 243 addresses total — was posted on the glass entrance of the convention center, which has become an emergency command post. It was like a list of the dead that is often released at the scene of major disasters, except there were addresses and Zip codes instead of names and ages. People stood in front of the sheets of paper throughout the day, recognizing their own and their neighbors’ addresses. The pain was communal.


 “This was our friend across the street,” said Mrs. Porterfield, 71, as she pointed at 109 South Buckhorn Drive, the address above theirs on the list.


 Bastrop is a small-town everytown to the east of Austin with a Best Buy and a Main Street, a place both historic — its timber industry supplied Austin with lumber in the 1840s — as well as scenic. It bills itself as the “Home of the Lost Pines” with its pine-covered hills, large swaths of which are now blackened, and is home to an eclectic mix of ranchers, retirees, white-collar professionals and blue-collar workers. One of the two bodies discovered on Tuesday was identified by the authorities as that of Michael Troy Farr, 48, an electrician for the City of Austin who was found outside his residence in the nearby town of Smithville.


 The fire has touched virtually everyone, and every thing. Public schools have shut their doors for the week. Hundreds of people have been sleeping overnight at emergency shelters, while other evacuees have rooms in local hotels or are staying with friends or relatives. The Hills Prairie Livestock Auction building became a kind of emergency shelter for evacuated horses and cattle. Since the wildfire began, ranchers seeking a safe haven for their animals have housed about 400 cows and 80 horses there.


 Nearly 21,000 fires since last November have destroyed more than 1,500 homes throughout the state, according to the Texas Forest Service. The Bastrop fire has been the worst so far, and as of Wednesday evening, the forest service said, it was still only about 30 percent contained.


 Residents were told it was still too dangerous to check on the condition of their homes, so before the list was posted, many of them had no idea if their houses had survived. Still others remain uncertain because their house was not among the 243 listed. The county’s top elected official, Judge Ronnie McDonald, said he expected the number of destroyed houses to double.


 Emotions have been running high for residents unable to see the damage for themselves and frustrated by a lack of information. One woman was arrested by state troopers for disregarding a barricade to get to her property.


 “It’s a tough time,” Judge McDonald said. “People are either anxious, nervous, upset — all the range of emotions. They lost personal belongings, memories, all those things. The main thing we have to focus on is safety. It’s tough telling someone they can’t get into their house.”

 In the annual duel for supremacy between Baltimore and Pittsburgh, Round 1 this year goes to the Ravens. No one on either side would be surprised if the decisive matchup occurs months from now -- in the playoffs. The Ravens forced a team-record seven turnovers Sunday and rolled to a 35-7 season-opening victory.

  Amazon
 
 is planning to launch a service that would offer customers access to a library of books for a fixed monthly fee, the Wall Street Journal reports citing sources familiar with the matter.


 Amazon is reportedly in talks with publishers about the service, but it’s unclear how far the project has gone along, as some publishers aren’t too happy with the idea.


 The details about the project are scarce, but it seems that the library would primarily contain older works, with restrictions on how many books a user can access each month. The service would also be available to subscribers of Amazon Prime, a membership program that gives users free shipping and access to movies and TV shows for $79 per year.


 Amazon has been on a roll this year, having launched Amazon Prime in February, and a
 
  subsidized version of Kindle
 
 in May. The retail giant reported a 51% jump in revenues for Q2 2011 and the
 
  fastest growth
 
 in a decade.


 The company is also rumored to launch a
 
  7-inch tablet
 
 , which – according to some
 
  analysts
 
 – might become a very serious competitor to Apple’s iPad.

 A moment of silence at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan. The reading of names in a grassy western Pennsylvania field. A wreath hung outside the Pentagon. A visit by President Obama to the Arlington National Cemetery graves of 60 U.S. service members killed in Afghanistan and Iraq.


 With solemn gestures large and small, Americans across the world marked the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the Pentagon in Virginia and World Trade Center in New York. Ten years after 19 hijackers crashed four jetliners in three East Coast locations, killing more than 3,000 people in the largest terrorist attack on U.S. soil, thousands of mourners returned to those spots under sunny skies reminiscent of the clear blue morning that changed the course of U.S. history.

 “What would you have me do instead?”
 

 To the critic who decries a project as a worthless folly, something that didn’t work out, something that challenged the status quo and failed, the artist might ask,
 

 “Is it better to do nothing?”
 

 To the critic who hasn’t shipped, who hasn’t created his art, anything less than better-than-what-I -have-now appears to be a waste. To this critic, progress should only occur in leaps, in which a fully functioning, perfected new device/book/project/process/system appears and instantly and perfectly replaces the current model.
 

 We don’t need your sharp wit or enmity, please. Our culture needs your support instead.
 

 Each step by any (and every) one who ships moves us. It might show us what won’t work, it might advance the state of the art or it might merely encourage others to give it a try as well.
 

 To those who feel that they have no choice but to create, thank you.

 Economists based in Google have predicted that an Internet boom in the UK could open as many as 365,000 jobs within the next five years, with the Internet accounting for a fifth of the regions GDP growth,
 
  The Telegraph reports
 
 .


 Google’s European Vice-President and chief of search operations Philipp Schindler believes that despite European businesses fighting to remain afloat during a period of economic uncertainty, Internet-based or Internet-related companies that use the web successfully were still growing strongly.



  “A study by McKinsey has shown that in France and in a mature economy like the UK, the internet is responsible for a fifth of GDP growth. In the UK, given the rate of job creation that economists associate with a rise in GDP, this translates into an expectation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs thanks to the internet,” he said.
 

  “And I think that is on the conservative side. That is what could be achieved by putting a focus on this sector. That feels to me like a sizeable number.”
 


 Schindler is in the UK to help drive Germany’s mid-sized sector, helping to drive the amount of goods exported by businesses in the region. He noted that for every pound that is imported, the UK exports “close to £3 in e-commerce goods and services”. He adds that the “UK is already doing relatively well in that sector but the ratio could be significantly higher”.


 Google drives home the point, backed by other technology companies, that businesses across Europe need to understand a series of digital “mega-trends” if they want to be able to reap the full benefits of what the Internet can offer. Recent trends include a shift to mobile, the adoption of Cloud-based technologies and online media could all help encourage innovation.


 Schindler also noted Google’s plans to expand its presence in the UK:



  “The UK is our second largest market in the world. In a lot of areas in the UK businesses are defining the online world globally, they are innovation leaders. In terms of investing in the UK, we will obviously continue to invest in the UK – on the engineering side and the business side. We’ve just opened our third office here in Soho, it has a lot of seats.”

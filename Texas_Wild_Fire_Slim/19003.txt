AP Top 25 college football  poll



For the 100th time, Oklahoma is No. 1.
The Sooners reached a milestone in the history of The Associated Press college football poll without even playing. Oklahoma is the first team to hold the top ranking 100 times since the poll began 1936.
The Sooners will bring that No. 1 ranking into one of the biggest nonconference games of the season when they face No. 5 Florida State in Tallahassee on Saturday.
Texas A&M, which did not play this week, dropped two spots to No. 9. Oklahoma State is No. 8.
Baylor moved one spot to No. 20 and Texas remained at No. 24. Missouri fell out of the Top 25 after Friday's 37-30 overtime loss at then-unranked Arizona State. The Sun Devils' win propelled them to No. 22. 
Alabama reclaimed the No. 2 spot after a 27-11 victory at Penn State, flip-flopping with No. 3 LSU. Last week, the Tigers jumped the Tide. Boise State is No. 4.
Defending national champion Auburn moved back into the rankings at No. 21 after one of the wildest wins from one of the wildest days in college football in recent memory.

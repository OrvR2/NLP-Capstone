   Hiring Demand for Engineers Over the Past 90 Days up 9%PRWeb – 19 hrs ago





   More than 130,000 new job ads were placed online for Engineers over the past 90 days, an increase of 9% from the same time in 2010, according to WANTED Analytics™New York, NY (PRWEB) September 07, 2011  Over the past 90 days, Recruiters at direct employers and staffing firms placed more than 130,000 new online job ads for Engineers, according to WANTED Analytics™ (http://www.wantedanalytics.com), the leading source of real-time business intelligence for the talent marketplace. This represents a 9% year-over-year increase in hiring demand for this field.
Industrial Engineers were the most demanded occupation in this field over the past 90 days, accounting for more than one-third of all engineering job ads. More than 42,000 new jobs were advertised online, up 17% from 2010. Mechanical Engineers and Electrical Engineers also saw high demand, with a 13% and 9% increase in hiring demand versus the same time period in 2010.
The five metropolitan areas with the highest ad volume during the last 90 days were Houston, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Detroit. Employers and staffing firms in Houston placed more than 5,600 new online job ads that for Engineers, the most of any city. Detroit, however, saw the greatest year-over-year increase at more than 59%.
As companies continue to demand Engineers, recruiting conditions will be moderately difficult across the US. According to the Hiring Scale™, the nationwide talent pool consists of approximately 16 potential candidates in the workforce for each engineering job ad over the past 90 days. However, each location will experience varying degrees of difficulty. For example, Detroit’s talent pool is the smallest of the previously mentioned five locations, with just 13 potential candidates, and it is likely that Recruiters will compete more heavily than average when sourcing for openings. In comparison, the talent pool in Los Angeles has 22 candidates per job opening over the past 90 days, the largest of these cities.
The Hiring Scale measures conditions in local job markets by comparing hiring demand and labor supply. The Hiring Scale is part of the WANTED Analytics platform that offers business intelligence for the talent marketplace.

Texas wildfires claim 700 homes, force evacuationsAFP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

Crews in Texas Tuesday battled dozens of wildfires that have destroyed more than 700 homes in just two days and forced thousands to flee thick smoke and flames.
"This is one of the meanest fires I've ever seen," Texas Governor Rick Perry told reporters after an aerial tour of the homes destroyed in the Steiner Ranch subdivision.
"The magnitudes of these losses are pretty stunning." 
The Republican White House hopeful had been campaigning in South Carolina ahead of a major debate on Wednesday night when the fires swept through subdivisions and towns near the state capitol of Austin.
He bowed out of several events so he could survey the damage and meet with evacuees.
The fires have been fanned by winds from a tropical depression that hit the southern United States over the weekend and have flared across ground left tinder dry by an intense summer drought, killing at least two people.
The worst blaze remains uncontrolled after devouring 30,000 acres (47 square miles or 121 square kilometers) and nearly 600 homes in Bastrop county, prompting mass evacuations as weather forecasts suggested the situation would get worse before it gets better.
More than 250 fire personnel battled the blaze in Bastrop, with planes and helicopters dumping water from above, but across the state the crews struggled to refill at lakes and rivers drained by the long, hot drought.
"There's practically a fleet of aircraft in the air," said Jan Amen, a Forest Service spokeswoman in Bastrop. "Problem is, we have to share them with other fires because there's so many burning in the area."
In East Texas, a fast-moving fire is believed to have killed a 20-year-old woman and her child, who failed to get out of their trailer home fast enough.
Gregg County Sheriff Maxey Cerliano told reporters the victims were found dead near Gladewater, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east of Fort Worth.
 Firefighters have responded to 181 blazes that have burned more than 118,000 acres in the past week, according to the latest situation report from the Texas Forest Service.
More than 3.5 million acres -- about the size of the state of Connecticut -- have been burned by 18,719 blazes since the wildfire season began in December.
Officials have ruled out arson as the cause of the fires and instead blame Tropical Depression Lee, which  was graded as a more serious tropical storm when it came ashore in southern Louisiana early Sunday.

I guess that prayer and rain dance didn't work well there did it Perry? When people finally grow up and understand that real problems need REAL solutions, instead of and invisible super hero made up by past society to feel better about disasters and the unknown, then we will be better off. Until then we are doomed to a broken society because of religious fundamentalist trying to pass Gods and Jesus off as REAL knowledge and logic.

I am a native Texan and here are a few things about Rick Perry: 
Thanks to Perry the schools here are ranked 47th and there is a multi-billion dollar deficit (approximately $4-billion) in the state's educational system that his policies created. He was warned by the then Republican State Comptroller 5-years ago that his tax cuts were going to cause the problem that Texas schools are going through right now. Most local school districts are facing huge budget deficits some in the multi-million dollar range and are laying off staff and teachers just to cover these shortfalls. In addition many schools are increasing class sizes to unheard of levels, in many incidents there are 30 or more students to a single teacher. 
There is a looming $27-billion deficit due next year for the state's budget that is not being talked about nationally but we in Texas are painfully aware of it. Perry took $6.4-billion in stimulus money from the Federal Government to help pay this years state deficit. This allowed the $9.1-billion State Rainy Day Fund, that Rick Perry controls, to go untouched.
Please take the time to read the article “Perry Mines Texas System to Raise Cash for Campaigns” in the New York Times, published August 20, 2011. It makes for some very interesting reading. 
As for job creation here in Texas, take a long look at the types of jobs that Perry claims to have created. For the most part these hare minimum wage or lower jobs and many are part-time.
Also look at the number of communities appearing on the 100 poorest cities in the USA. Thirty-five of the 100 are located here in Texas.
He tried to take private land here through eminent domain so that a Spanish company, Cintra could build the Trans-Texas Corridor, a super transportation system that has since been canceled when a number if issues arose about the project. More and more of the new highways build here in Texas are toll-roads, one the latest is the State Highway 121 project in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area, another controversial tollroad project involving Cintra. Cintra would have the right to collect tolls on the road for 50-years. A lot of questions were raised when it came out that the North Texas Tollway Authority was preventing from bidding on this project. A number of unanswered questions about Perry's relationship with Cintra are surfacing now and I am sure will require answers during the presidential campaign.
He also signed an executive order that would have pushed a program to require 6th grade school girls be vaccinated with a very controversial drug (Gardasil) to protect against Human Papillomavirus or HPV created by Merck which is intended to prevent cervical cancer in sexually active females. A lot of questions were raised about his motives and he dropped his push for the program when those questions became too controversial. Again, a lot of these questions centered on his financial relationship with Merck.
These are just a few issues that will be raised during the vetting process and it is doubtful that he will be able to survive the scrutiny of the national press. As we in Texas have found out, Rick Perry is not who he purports to be. Please take the time to really learn about him before you make up your mind.
If you care to do your own research please check Google, Wikipedia, The Comptroller of the State of Texas, Forbes, The Austin American Statesman, The Dallas Morning News, The Forth Worth Star Telegram, The Houston Chronicle. The New York Times, The Washington Post, just to name a few of my sources.

Notice that Perry hasn't begged the feds for a SINGLE DIME. Here in Texas we pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps, other states need to follow our lead. Hopefully Perry makes good on his word and gets rid of FEMA, nothing but another government giveaway program.

Back in April, Rick Perry requested and received almost $28-billion from FEMA to help with victims of the wildfires. Wonder how much he will ask Obama for this time?

I've seen less hateful comments on comment boards concerning illegal immigration. Americans are losing everything that they have and all you people have is hate. Texas could secede tomorrow because they do have plenty of resources and we would probably lose our Double A Rating. Most of you are to stupid to realize exactly what Texas does for America. Ask any geologist what Texas does for America.  Look at all this hate and negativity coming from complete strangers. You people call yourselves Americans??? I feel sorry for all those people who lost their houses and some cases their lives down there. Texas should secede. They should. They should Keep their oil, oil refineries, their aquifer ( you know the one that supplies other states with water that I,m sure that F.E.M.A. has never used to fight other wildfires in other states), their job growth and other resources.  Everybody hating on Texas seems to forget that are a couple of States and their economies that are dependent on Texas for water.If the Federal government is not willing to help out Texas maybe Texas should cut off those other States that are dependent on the Aquifer under Texas and use that water to control the fires and irrigate their own land to prevent all these wild fires from occurring.  With they present state of our own economy if they were to secede it would be a blow to the economy. If Texas did secede I know I would move there.

What is wrong with you people?  Instead of putting down Texas and scrutinizing Rick Perry, maybe you should take a look at what this article is actually about.  An enormous tragedy is occuring, and really your first thought is basically, haha let it burn or Rick Perry should be doing a better job???  How about thinking hey, maybe my first impression of Tx people wasn't the best but they are a people in need, what is there I can do to help..!!  I don't think New Orleans was worth rebuilding but, my first thought was, how awful, how can I help?!!  Your sick person when you can't get past yourself, and think of others!!  I guarantee the people of Tx are the most gracious and generous when it comes to helping out other states, we don't first think hey your not worth it, so we can forget about it.  We offer help in any way we can!!!

We moved from Bastrop last spring.  The home we sold burned this weekend!  My sympathy goes out to the people in that area.

I have lived in Texas all my live. We will be fine because we support each other and always help those in other states when needed. We took in thousands of people during the Katrina disataer and we will do it again no matter what.  I am not the biggest Rick Perry fan, but do appreciate the fact that he left the campaign trail to come home and take care of business. At least he's not in Hawaii on vacation.

To all you bashing Texas and Perry. Atleast he is doing his job. Goes to show the citizens are his no.1 priority. More than Obama can say. Good for Perry it's nice to know he cares and is willing to put his campaigning on hold to do the job he was elected to do. He has my vote. To all you wonderful Texans, wishing you the best and hoping for a quick recovery.

I'm sure Bachman will state that this is god's punishment for Perry supporting the $5 "pole tax" for all nude strip bars and of course, Perry will insure that FEMA offers NO money or relief to the people affected by this disaster. The government has NO place assisting its citizens; taxes are an abomination and should only be used to purchase instruments of war from Halliburton.

Remember when Perry asked people to pray for rain as a solution to the drought.  How's that working out?  Denying climate change and the effects of human-caused pollution on the planet will be our demise.  Everyone used to worry about nuclear catastrophe, but greenhouse gas caused catastrophe is going to be much worse.

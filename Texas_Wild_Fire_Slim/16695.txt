“The Times They Are A-Changing.”

Amazing how this song never goes obsolete, ain’t it?
Simply.
Amazing.

Also: me hurting your brain again after the fold. (more…)

Movie of the Week: Sherlock Holmes.

…Because Sherlock Holmes was fun in a way that demonstrated that somebody in Hollywood actually likes Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, that’s why.  And because the American ambassador had the right idea, dammit.
And so passes The Wolf Man.  Aroooo.

#rsrh Three universes over, we’re all getting drunk…

…because three universes over, we’d (we being at least me, Glenn Reynolds, and I think probably Harry Turtledove*) be in the universe where it was the two-year anniversary of our ignominious cutting and running from the GWOT, courtesy of then-Senator Barack Obama’s Iraq war De-Escalation Act of 2007.  And while there might have been some exceptionally bleak, bitter humor in watching said alternate President Obama explain why his signature legislation had created nothing but a miserable failure of a terrorist haven state, I’m much happier to have won this one instead.
Moe Lane
PS: I spent a few minutes trying to figure out how to express my utter contempt for the antiwar movement for conspiring to win American elections by trying to throw Iraqi bodies on the fire – but just saying so works just fine, doesn’t it?  So: Not In Your Name.
Not then.
Not now.
Not ever.
*Interesting interview here.

Well, Wednesday started well…

…and then it turned into Wednesday.  It’s not even that there isn’t anything going on; it’s that I’m not in the groove right now.  Or something.  Possibly I just require bacon.
Aww, go read Ace.  He’s doing even better than usual today.  Somebody corporate should give him a gig.

While we’re on the subject of Democratic inflammatory rhetoric…

…please take the time to watch the Trip Down Memory Lane by Evan Coyne Maloney found beneath the fold.  I apologize in advance for the NSFW nature of this video – it features habitual and strong profanity, trivialization of the Holocaust, and open and explicit calls for violent revolution against the United States government – but it is in fact impossible to do an accurate video involving the rhetoric found among the Democratic party’s progressive base without prominently displaying all three.

Oh, *no*.  *More* political maps inciting violence!

Putting targets on Congressmen!

They even explicitly used the word ‘targeting!’ Those awful Republicans!
…Oh, wait, that’s a DCCC map.  Dated February of this year.  Look at it fast, before they sanitize.
Verum Serum has much, much  more; including one more Democratic map from 2004 (which includes the perfectly nonviolent phrase ‘Behind Enemy Lines’).  Look, I know that the DCCC pulls in its personnel from the shallow end of the Democratic Party’s political gene pool these days, but surely they can at least check first the stuff that gets babbled by Van Hollen, yes?  This kind of language has a long history to it, and given that yet another Republican office has been vandalized (this time in Michigan), I think that it’s time that the Democrats start cooling their inflammatory rhetoric suggesting otherwise…

#rsrh Maryland considering Amazon tax again?

Yes.  Of course.  Because Amazon won’t pull their affiliate program out of Maryland – thus making the entire exercise moot – the moment that it passes.  Just like they didn’t do it in North Carolina or Rhode Island, and just like they aren’t still thinking about doing it in New York, depending on how the court cases go.
And before I hear about how this won’t have any effect on individual affiliates, so Amazon.com is being absurd:
The bill would require a Web retailer like Amazon.com to charge sales tax on orders to Maryland  customers if the retailer gets more than $10,000 in sales a year from affiliate marketers — sites run by businesses or individuals in the state that have contracts to send sales traffic to large retailers.
Ten grand in sales, not profit.  That’s small.  How small? Let me put it this way:  MoeLane.com’s referrals last year would have required Amazon to collect sales tax.  Not that I saw ten grand in revenue, or even a tenth of that (and the amount that I did see was duly taxed by the State of Maryland, even though as far as I can tell the State of Maryland didn’t do anything specific to earn its cut).  And if these Senatorial idiots Richard S. Madaleno and Ulysses Currie (both Democrats, of course) have their way, I – and the State of Maryland – won’t see a tenth of that tenth, because my Amazon Associates account will be terminated before the ink’s dry on the signature of their shiny new law.  
And then nobody gets any money.
My only comfort is that I didn’t actually vote for any of these people.  Being a Republican, and everything.
Moe Lane
PS: Full disclosure, in case it isn’t obvious: I am an affiliate of Amazon.com (ahem).  At least, for right now.

Obama’s drilling bribe is insultingly small.

[UPDATE] Welcome, Instapundit readers.
(H/T: Hot Air Headlines)  Does he really think that this is sufficient to peel off  cap-and-tax opposition?  Let’s  do some strategic bolding:
The Obama administration’s plan adopts some drilling  proposals floated by President George W. Bush near the end of his  tenure, including opening much of the Atlantic and Arctic Coasts. Those  proposals were challenged in court on environmental grounds  and set aside by President Obama shortly after he took office.
[snip]
The first lease sale off the coast of Virginia could occur as  early as next year in a triangular tract 50 miles off the coast  that had already been approved for development but was held up by  a court challenge and additional Interior Department review, officials  said.
But as a result of the Obama decision, the Interior Department will  spend several years conducting geologic and environmental studies  along the rest of the southern and central Atlantic Seaboard. If a tract is deemed suitable for development, it is listed for sale in a  competitive bidding system. The next lease sales — if any are  authorized by the Interior Department — would not be held before  2012.
Let me put it another way: the White House is implying the  promise of jam tomorrow - in reality, it’s just a study to  revisit the denial of jam yesterday - in exchange for jam today.   Only the jam today is actually a swarm of angry wasps.  Try  again, Mr. President.  Start with rescinding your interference  with the Bush drilling permits, and expect to give up more.  A lot more:  your opponents are not interested in indulging the Greenies’ quaint,  somewhat primitive religious sensibilities.

‘Going Back to Cali.’


Going Back To Cali, LL Cool J
Jeebus, this song is old enough to drink.  Oh, yeah, right: I’m 40.  That’s why.

The “Learn From My Fail” blog.

And oh my yes, but you should.
A taste:
When discussing your wife’s birthday present, don’t mention you got it  at a 7-11 at 11:30 the previous night, even if she loves it.
Not that I’ve ever done anything like that, of course.

Hey, I need a favor. Yes, *another* one.

My friend and RS colleague Caleb Howe could use some help. More here: he can be mad at us later.
In the meantime: I don’t miss meals from not being paid for any of this, so if you were thinking of dropping money into my account please instead drop it in his.

One World Trade Center, the skyscraper centerpiece of the new World Trade Center, is rising rapidly. After many false starts, it can now be seen from most parts of the city, and the the accompanying memorial plaza opens on the tenth anniversary of the attacks. 
But it wasn't easy getting to where we are now. There were politicians, businessmen, citizens, widows and developers to please, and until the Port Authority began construction on the current 1 WTC, anything was possible. Indeed, wildly inventive proposals from the world's best designers were submitted to the city to rebuild up from the ruins.

Below are a few of the proposals that didn't make the cut. The highly detailed renderings show an alternate World Trade Center vastly different that what we will soon have, for better or for worse. Judge for yourself:

NEW YORK- DECEMBER 18:  The proposed design by architects Foster and Partners for the rebuilding of New York's World Trade Center site is seen December 18, 2002 in New York City. This begins a six-week review before a final plan is chosen. Seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood. All designs will be on display in New York's World Financial Center and on the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's (LMDC) web site.  (Photo by LMDC/Getty Images)

				Humans are weird.  Just rebuild the old ones.  Or something grander.  Don't build that crappy single tower - that's down-gradi­ng.  Upgrade!  You knock them down and we will rebuild them bigger and better!  But keep a link to the past, to the previous versions.

				I don't think simply rebuilding the same WTC buildings, which were roundly criticized themselves­, would've been ideal.  Why not make something new and bold for the 21st century out of the ashes of that horrible day to demonstrat­e resilience­, yet innovation­, rather than simply rebuilding 60's architectu­re that was never really well-recei­ved to begin with?

				I would be for subtle changes and improvemen­ts, but not for this thing.  They did look like they were built in the 70's - they had that aesthetic.  However, the same towers could have been rebuilt, but with a more modern design.  Something more angular like some of the designs here, but definitely not smaller!

				Completely disagree.  There were some neat designs there, although most did indeed suck.  I still say that they should have rebuilt the towers, although an update in design would have been nice.  It's a statement besides everything else - downgradin­g to a single smaller tower is a really dumb idea IMHO.

				With all due respect the twin towers were referred to in NYC as the packing crates that the Empire State and The Chrysler came in.  The isolated plaza was an idea that went out of favor years ago and the absolute minimal approach was looked on as a joke.

				I -- and everyone I know - LOVED the design of the Twin Towers. They reflected the sunrise and sun set beautifull­y... they were gorgeous at night... sometimes you'd see the moon between them.... Their weight and magnificen­t presence were truly the anchors of Manhattan. My heart still breaks when I look down Sixth Avenue and see the void where they were, like two missing teeth in the sky. I never ever heard that packing crate thing. Obviously, to each his own, but I think their design was well loved by many. (I have some of the most wonderful memories of my life from times in the plazas -- once they removed the Richard Serra of course :-)

				Thanks Janie - Just FYI, here's a summary of the criticism of the plan after it was opened: (Wikipedia­)

The World Trade Center design brought criticism of its aesthetics from the American Institute of Architects and other groups. Lewis Mumford, author of The City in History and other works on urban planning, criticized the project and described it and other new skyscraper­s as "just glass-and-­metal filing cabinets." The twin towers' narrow office windows, only 18 inches wide, were disliked by many for impairing the view from the buildings.

The trade center's "superbloc­k," replacing a more traditiona­l, dense neighborho­od, was regarded by some critics as an inhospitab­le environmen­t that disrupted the complicate­d traffic network typical of Manhattan. For example, in his book The Pentagon of Power, Lewis Mumford denounced the center as an "example of the purposeles­s giantism and technologi­cal exhibition­ism that are now eviscerati­ng the living tissue of every great city.

I understand your attachment­, but I have to agree with the above.  The plan that is shaping up now is much more humane and of course will be beloved by New Yorkers everywhere­.

				IMO Foster and Partners is the best of the presented original designs. That said none of these proposals are incredibly inspiring. I think a better decision would've been to rebuild twin towers in exactly the same footprint (actually bigger if possible) as the original towers. Rebuild them, bigger, better and stronger. But that's just me.

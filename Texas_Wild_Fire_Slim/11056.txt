          When the Nazis came for the communists, I remained silent; I was not a communist. When they locked up the social democrats, I remained silent; I was not a social democrat. When they came for the trade unionists, I did not speak out; I was not a trade unionist. When they came for the Jews, I remained silent; I wasn't a Jew. When﻿ they came for me, there was no one left to speak out

@Spiderweb127 Well, as long as you understand it isn't written﻿ into our laws, AND IT IS in almost every other country in the WORLD...and that you don't mean to imply that by saying "official", then I guess I'm good.
As for what is and isn't the immigrant's responsibility, I take a more relaxed view than you, but we're welcome to disagree as far as I'm concerned.
Hey, it was nice having a civil discourse with you over this. Past experience had me expecting insults any moment ;D

@aaronsande Obviously your definition of "official" and mine are different and I wll not argue semantics. It does not change the fact that it is the immigrants responsibility to learn the culture and the language of the land they wish to be apart of no matter what country it is. This has been the case of immigration thus﻿ far. If that is conservative to you then so be it. It is not a dirty word.

@Spiderweb127 First of all good. Secondly, completely wrong. An official language for any country is always written into law. In our country, nothing of the sort is written into law. You﻿ are merely discussing what the "most common" language is in America.
That has nothing to do with "official". Your views on this are extremely conservative. All the more so because you do not seem to care that there IS no official declaration of English as our language. Other countries do have that.

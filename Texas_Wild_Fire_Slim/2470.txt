Arkansas police are investigating the death of a man found naked in a hot tub next to a sleeping TV weatherman.
A friend woke meteorologist Brett Cummins, of Little Rock station KARK, on Labor Day. He found the forecaster snoring in the empty whirlpool next to a nude man with a dog collar around his neck, The Arkansas Democrat & Gazette reported. 
The 36-year-old resident who made the grisly discovery, Christopher Barbour, allegedly told police that the victim, 24-year-old Dexter Williams, was blue in the face and lying near Cummins' shoulder, ArkansasNews.com reported.
Barbour says the two men were in his home the night before, drinking and snorting drugs. Police haven't determined the cause of death, but a detective allegedly found a ring of blood in the bottom of the empty tub, ArkansasNews.com said. 
Police are waiting for autopsy results and don't consider Cummins a suspect, radio station KUAR said. 
KARK announced on Tuesday that Cummins wouldn't be on the air because he's "mourning the loss of a friend."

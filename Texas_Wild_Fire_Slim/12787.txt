Hallmark is rushing to Bay Area stores its new line of greeting cards. Look for 'em under the heading, "Sorry, Alex!"
I said you sucked and wrote you off/But I was only jokin'/How could I really doubt you, Al?/What could I have been smokin'?
Of the NFL's 30 starting quarterbacks, Alex Smith went into the season as No. 1 in volume and intensity of hometown skeptics, doubters and haters.
Many quarterbacks opened the season under a cloud of suspicion, but Smith was their poster guy. Coming off six seasons of sub-brilliance in a demanding town, Smith carried more emotional baggage than a skycap on steroids.
One game, Sunday's 33-17 win over the visiting Seahawks, didn't wipe out all the animosity that's been directed at Smith, and at coach Jim Harbaugh for championing Smith. But Sunday's game left the hard-core skeptics confused and conflicted, their core beliefs shaken.
This was a huge win for the 49ers. Harbaugh's debut, Smith's new life, the possibility of losing the opener to the truly challenged Seahawks.
Smith completed 15 of 20 passes for 124 yards and had a passer rating of 90.4. He ran an offense that turned the ball over zero times.
Yet Smith's game had something for everyone. For the hard-core haters, his offense was 1-for-12 on third-down conversions, and the third quarter was wretched - six total pass plays that resulted in minus-2 net yards passing.
But Smith's drive just before halftime? Yessir. Five straight passing plays, four completions (for 29 yards) and an 11-yard scramble, then his 1-yard touchdown plunge.
So there's plenty of ammo for both sides in today's water-cooler debates.
Here's the thing you should know about the guy, though: It's almost eerie how unaffected by the haters Smith seems.
Other quarterbacks in his situation might have developed a shoulder chip the size of Alcatraz. Other quarterbacks might have used Sunday's victory as a forum to suggest where the haters could stuff their negativity.
Not Smith. Either he somehow has ignored the criticism, he is a fantastic actor, or he has a Teflon hide that deflects slings and arrows. Is he really such a nice, well-balanced young man that he cannot be simmering over all the bad stuff? 
Asked after the game if this win gives him a measure of vindication over the doubters, Smith looked almost puzzled.
 "I don't know about vindication," he said. "It's 1-0 - that's great. The biggest thing for a quarterback is getting the win, find a way. Defense helped a lot tonight, special teams ... "
If you're wondering what the heck Harbaugh saw in this guy to give him another shot in San Francisco, there's a clue. Smith can shut out a lot of outside bullcorn and focus on football. That's a skill Harbaugh also possesses.
They're both driven by a desire to play really good, efficient, winning football, not by a need to prove the world wrong.
After all Smith has gone through - and, yes, after all he's put you fans through - he's still the engaging, intelligent, likable guy next door. 
It's significant that when Smith scored on that 1-yard scramble with time running out in the first half for a 16-0 lead, Harbaugh greeted him on the sideline with a hug. Yes, the 49ers' coach is channeling his inner Tommy Lasorda.
Clearly, these two men are in sync. Harbaugh is the voice in Smith's helmet radio before every play. Apparently, Smith responds to logical, intelligent, creative input.
"I think it's just great to have the direct line with coach Harbaugh," Smith said. "You get the little things here and there, the little reminders."
Harbaugh's voice has to be soothing reassurance to Smith, something new for him.
It worked out great Sunday, although there were times the Seahawks didn't look so much like a team that was poorly coached as like a team that was uncoached. For the 49ers, the road gets rockier next week against the Cowboys.
Smith and Harbaugh will quickly move on to that challenge, but Smith left no doubt that this win meant something deep.
"It was special," he said, "to be able ... to hold up your end of the deal."
This will be an intriguing ongoing story - Smith versus the league and Smith versus the local doubters/haters/skeptics.
One thing Smith knows is that you can't always be on top and that you have to keep the faith. As he walked out of Candlestick on Sunday, he was wearing a Giants ballcap.
Alex Smith the survivor Of the quarterbacks who were the first QBs taken in the past 10 drafts, only Smith and Matthew Stafford played and won on Sunday.Draft year1st QB (overall pick)Sunday status 2002 David Carr (1) Backup for losing Giants 2003 Carson Palmer (1) At home, hoping Bengals set him free 2004 Eli Manning (1) 18-of-32 for 268 yards in Giants' loss 2005 Alex Smith (1) 15-of-20 for 124 yards in 49ers' win 2006 Vince Young (3) Injured backup for winning Eagles 2007 JaMarcus Russell (1) Out of the game 2008 Matt Ryan (3) 31-of-47 for 319 yards in Falcons' loss 2009 Matthew Stafford (1) 24-of-33 for 305 yards in Lions' win 2010 Sam Bradford (1) 17-of-30 for 188 yards in Rams' loss2011 Cam Newton (1) 24-of-37 for 422 yards in Panthers' lossA Seattle guy Smith, a Seattle native, has feasted, relatively speaking, on the Seahawks' defense. He's had a 90-plus passer rating in 16 of his 55 career games (29 percent). But against Seattle, he's 5-of-9 (56 percent).

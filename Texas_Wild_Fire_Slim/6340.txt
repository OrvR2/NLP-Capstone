Wajahat Ali: The Post-Osama Muslim American


							            							            The rich and complex identity of Muslim American communities is now personified by a terrorist leader who suffered from narcissism and a compulsive need to release YouTube videos.							        



 








Coleen Rowley and Bogdan Dzakovic: Could WikiLeaks Have Helped Thwart 9/11?


							            							            Most troubling in the case of 9/11 is the realization of how little information-sharing with the public and the airlines it would have taken to sound the alarm.							        



 






Grace Nasri: The Surge in Islamophobia


							            							            Many may not realize this, but the majority of Muslims are victims of these fringe believers who have all but hijacked Islam, drowned out the religion's message of peace. 							        



 






Don McNay: September 11 Anniversary: A Chance for Main Street to Reflect and Take Economic Action


							            							            Until Washington gets the courage to trust the American people to handle hard and sobering decisions -- and develops a plan of action that does not favor one interest group over another -- real economic solutions are not going to come from Washington.							        



 






Cathleen Falsani: 10 Years After 9/11, the Question Remains the Same


							            							            If I have learned anything in the decade that has passed since terror became a visceral part of our daily reality, it is to be comfortable and satisfied with not knowing.							        



 






Joshua Stanton: The Interfaith Movement Steps Up to Commemorate 9/11


							            							            Perhaps galvanized to action by last year's spate of Islamophobia, this summer has been one of planning and coalescence for the interfaith movement. The goal is clear, tangible and immediate: to ensure that the commemoration of 9/11 is not an excuse for venom...							        



 






Christian de la Huerta: On 9/11 Anniversary, Love Your Enemy


							            							            How much longer will we walk around with anger and resentment in our hearts, feeling wronged and victimized? Forgiveness is an act of personal liberation. Not doing it keeps us stuck in the past.							        



 






Nicole Neroulias: American Muslims and the 9/11 Anniversary: Is the Best Defense a Good Offense?


							            							            It'll be a balancing act for journalists to cover the emotions of the 9/11 anniversary: without sacrificing the facts, they will also have to maintain some responsibility.

				Samuel Clemens said of hope

It is like any other agricultur­e: if you hoe it and harrow it and water it enough, you can make three blades of it grow where none grew before. If you've got nothing to plant, the process is slow and difficult, but if you've got a seed of some kind or other--any kind will answer--yo­u get along a good deal faster.

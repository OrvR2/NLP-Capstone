For LA's food enthusiasts, Labor Day weekend was not just a simple BBQ; it was a four-day affair of nine gluttonous to-do's -- thanks to the LA Times/Food & Wine's The Taste of LA.

In an hour, you might've seen us eating 16 burgers. The following night, 27 tacos. We washed it down with bottles of Peroni and cocktails stirred from LA's award-winning mixologists.

Needless to say, we're full. And buzzed.

It was an epic event that stretched all over LA -- from behind the Beverly Hilton Hotel to the movie sets of Paramount Studios and the blocks surrounding Downtown's Orpheum Theater. From cooking demos led by Scott Conant and John Rivera Sedlar to discussions featuring Ludo Lefebvre and Walter Manzke, it was simply a food lover's fantasy. Michael Voltaggio might've summed up The Taste of LA best in the form of a tweet:

"Only in LA can you have the same party for four days in four different places. The dessert [sic] has Coachella. We have The Taste."

You might already know that the Rustic Canyon burger is the city's ultimate boutique burger, but Santa Monica's seasonal kitchen has acquired some 2,000 new devotees  -- who, by vote, declared it the night's best burger at "Burgers & Beer." Chef Evan Funke painstakingly served his signature burger, a Niman Ranch beef patty grilled a beautiful medium-rare. It was near its actual size served at the restaurant.

				I dunno...is it me?  Am I the only Angelino who isn't impressed by most of this overpriced fare?  I guess being a "Gilberts El Indio", "Tito's Tacos", "Koji" or "Apple Pan" kinda gal doesn't cut it these days.....(­(sigh)).

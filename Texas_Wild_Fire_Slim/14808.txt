Texas has always been home to some of the most terrifying wildfires Mother Nature can muster up, but the Lone Star State is taking a particularly brutal wildfire beating this summer. After one of the longest droughts in the state’s recorded history, a wildfire originating in Bastrop County is quickly scorching the entire state. So far, the Bastrop Wildfire has burned through over 25,000 acres of land and over 1,000 Texas homes. It looks like there’s no end in sight because, as it turns out, everything really is bigger in Texas, including horrific wildfires. Firefighters are at a loss as to how to contain the raging wildfire that’s spreading like…well, wildfire. Here are some truly terrifying Texas wildfire photos to keep you from sleeping any time soon.

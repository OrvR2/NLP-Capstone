Republican running to replace Weiner criticizes 9/11 compensation lawBy Rachel Rose HartmanPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Rachel Rose Hartman | The Upshot – Thu, Aug 25, 2011

Turner (Screenshot/Bob Turner for Congress)Bob Turner, the Republican running in the special election to replace Anthony Weiner, says the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which provides health coverage to the first responders and others near Ground Zero after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, covers too many individuals.
"I think it is a little too broad," the businessman told the New York Daily News' editorial board this week, singling out the many volunteers who assisted in recovery efforts at Ground Zero. "My call would be to protect police, fire, emergency workers, construction workers, etc.," Turner said. "If someone said, 'I volunteered' or walked through there, it's just not the type."
Overall, Turner says he supports the bill, noting he has fireman in his family. "But is that bill beyond criticism? No," he told the board.

These are the same people who vote to continue funding phony wars, or give billions to people who want to kill you. But THERE GOD forbid someone might sneak some healthcare. The party of less government unless some pakistanis want money!

Of course some will take advantage by just walking in and saying they volunteered on 9/11
to get healthcare. [I am sure the number of people doing this is minute] But we shouldn't let this effect the healthcare of the people who ran to the disaster on 9/11.

All my and my loved ones send care and love to all who were in 9/11/2001 New York and to all the loved ones who lost so much.                                                 Thank you to all of you from the USA & the world who wanted to help and went to New York to do just that in any way you could or helped in other ways as well. Just needed to let you know how much you mean to us all. For those who died and those who survived to all their loved ones you are still within our hearts. I haven't been to New York for so very long but we will always help you in any way we can always-from the countryside with care & love.

lets only cover the people who were there because it was their job, yet, let's screw the real heroes who put there life on the line because it was in their hearts to do so.

You may look at the premium amount and think that there is no way that you can afford it. You cannot afford to be without health insurance! shop around you may find it easy to find an affordable premium, I always find health insurance through "Penny Health" network.

Typical Repub- talks about heros and patroitism, but then turns around and wants to screw the same heros he praises.

He knows how many people in America will fake just to get insurance, that's what this country has become!

Actually if the responders were injured during the carrying out of their duties as responders, the city of New York should be held liable under the workers compensation laws.  They should be taken care of and their medical bills should be paid by the city that employed them and was responsible for their health and safety while on the job.  I'm not talking about those that were killed in the attacks during the rescue efforts, but I am talking about those that were injured during the recovery efforts.  The city has a duty to protect its workers under state and federal law.   In addition, if the federal, state or city was involved in covering up the actual conditions at the site while recovery ops were underway, they should be held criminally liable.  Just my 2 cents worth.

The real thing 9/11 created that was not needed and is major reason we added trillions to debt since 2011 drum roll. Homeland security dept. Sure 3 to 4,000 died on 9/11. So instead of going after what was done wrong by FBI to Improve them. Instead we create redundant law enforcement agency that costs us 100s of billions a year on top of all the ones we already have. This is why along with War in Iraq and staying is Afgan 10 years were we can never win that war costs us this country. The debt is so bad and what we continue to pay for that is not needed. How we reacted to terroists ruined this country. We have more died monthly in poverty then 9/11. Every freakin month! I don't see the same over reaction to preventing all those deaths?

The Fact that Cheney admits he was in favor and still is in favor of water boarding I think we should give him a taste of his own medication that he wants others to take. This YELLOW heBELLY who got 5 FIVE defermants and sent others to die in combat should be able to take it, after all he claims he is a tough guy. If this is not the way to go lets just turn him and his BUDDY George w OVER to the World Court to stand Trial for War Crimes, they both should get the same mddicne. By the way we can also give them good old Carl Rove who claims he made them what they are.

Considering it was the feds job to keep 9-11 from happening, they should be held liable for the medical treatment for those who were injured because of their failure.

If it was his fat azz dieing with an asbestos related illness, he'd be blubbering like Boner for a bill to compensate one and all. These are the same heartless Republican a-holes that gladly send our brave military into harm's way and then don't want to cover their medical expenses when they return home mutilated and desperate for long term care. They can all go to hell carrying their untaxed bags of gold.

Why was this fund set-up to begin with? Next we will set-up a fund for every emergency fire, accident, etc in the country, show up and afterwards make a claim and retire for life on the tax payers dime.

Hailed as heroes, now reviled as deadbeats by Republicans, who also say the unemployed and all American working class are deadbeats.

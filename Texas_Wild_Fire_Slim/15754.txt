'Creature' Feature's Opening One of the Worst Ever at the Box OfficeBy Daniel Frankel – Mon, Sep 12, 2011 12:04 AM EDT

'Creature' Movie Poster (The Bubble Factory)While it played to a precious few fans, the indie horror film "Creature"
 did manage to put the fear of god into its producers, and pretty much 
everyone else associated with the film, at the weekend box office. The film grossed only $331,000 opening up in 1,507 U.S. theaters 
this weekend, making it the worst premiere ever for a film opening in 
1,500 locations or more, according to BoxOfficeMojo.com.
 On a per screen basis, the horror film's debut was even worse than 
that of "Transylmania," an indie horror comedy that set the record for 
worst opening for a film opening in 1,000 or more theaters.

 "Transylmania" grossed a miserable $263,941, opening up at 1,007 
locations in December 2009, averaging $262 per engagement. "Creature" 
averaged only $220 per theater.
 Putting that in perspective, $220 is about what one row of moviegoers spent on popcorn for the last "Harry Potter" movie.
 The story of a swamp monster living in the Louisiana Bayou, 
"Creature" was produced for an undisclosed "microbudget" and 
self-distributed by Sid and Jon Sheinberg's Bubble Factory -- Sid being 
the president of Universal Studios during the release of "Jaws," "ET" 
and "Jurassic Park."

 The film was directed by Fred Andrews, a veteran production designer
 for TV procedural dramas like "CSI: Miami" and "Without a Trace," who 
oversaw a cast of largely no-name actors.
 As for the plot, stop us if you've heard this before: gang of young 
adults gets into scary inbred trouble when they venture into a sparsely 
populated rural area.
 The logline: An ex-Navy seal (played by "True Blood's" Mehcad 
Brooks), his girlfriend (Serinda Swan of "Breakout Kings") and their 
friends head out on a road trip to New Orleans. The group decides to 
stop at a roadside convenience store owned by Chopper (veteran horror 
actor Sid Haig), who tells them the tale of Lockjaw, a fabled god-like 
creature who is half-man, half-alligator.
 Of course, their curiousity means that they have to meet Lockjaw 
themselves ... leading to scary results for the roughly 35,000 people 
who paid to see the film ... or maybe not so scary. There was certainly 
little buzz about this movie, which wasn't screened for critics prior to
 its release. (Rotten Tomatoes gave it a "6 percent fresh" rating, which
 was precisley 6 percent more than Sony comedy "Bucky Larson: Born to Be
 a Star" received, perhaps meaning "Creature" wasn't necessarily the 
worst film, qualitatively, of the weekend.)
 The film was promoted, but only to a point.
 The producers say they made "significant" TV ad buys, buying spots on low-cost NBCU cable channels including SyFy, G4, and E!.

 "We produced and self-distributed "Creature" with a great deal of 
enthusiasm and we knew we needed to be innovative and bold with our 
release plan," said Jon Sheinberg of Bubble Releasing, in statement 
shortly before the film's Friday release."Hopefully we will pave the way for independent filmmakers to have a
 new template for indie films to be released on a national level."
 Well, they've got their template, just not the one Sheinberg had in mind.Watch the trailer for "Creature" (VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED: Scary content):

Of the 35,000 people who paid to see it, I wonder just how many watched the whole thing and didn't run out of the theater.

it's funny how it has the 1985 title, yet nothing close to that movie, and I laugh how it is similar to the the one Craig T Nelson did on sci fi

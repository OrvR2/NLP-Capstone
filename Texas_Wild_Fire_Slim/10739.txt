Millionaire Marriott hotel president’s son wins $107M playing lotteryBy Jordan Chittley | Daily Buzz – Fri, 9 Sep, 2011

While it may make for a more heartwarming story, it isn't always laid off workers or people down on their luck who miraculously win the lottery.
The son of a millionaire hotel executive has just won $107 million playing Mega Millions in the U.S. Brian McCarthy, the 25-year-old son of Marriott President Robert McCarthy, went into a grocery store to withdraw money from an ATM when he decided on a whim to buy five Mega Millions tickets, according to Powerball.com.
McCarthy's dad earned more than $1.2 million in 2009 for his role overseeing more than 3,000 hotels including the Ritz-Carlton, according to Forbes.
Upon learning of the winning, Powerball.com reports his grandmother said, "That's wonderful . . . You deserve it. Can I make you a grilled cheese sandwich?"
McCarthy who was working as an account manager for Pepsi had reportedly just moved back in with his parents. He has also won a pair of $1,000 tickets in the past.
McCarthy elected to take the one-time cash option of $68.4 million and is already spending it buying a BMW and planning a golf trip to Ireland. He also donated $50,000 to two charities.
No word if McCarthy will be getting a place of his own.

Instead of all the hate, why not just say what we would DO with the money? 

I would buy a nice home, spoil my friends, buy some businesses and donate a good 50 million to Stem Cell Research :)

congrats to him, but there should be a rule that the upper class can't play the lottery...i mean, he did just win lower and middle class money.

I can never respect adult children who move back home to live with mommy and daddy.
I left home at 21 and lived in a rooming house.  Yes I had a nice home, but nothing could
beat the independence I felt when i first moved into that rooming house.  I guess young
people today don't have much of a sense of adventure, and god forbid that they should
rough it for while.

To .SAM, I understand winning lottery is based purely on luck and I didn't mention anything about who is worthy or not. I don't know why you came up with that idea.  I am just suggesting what lotto winners should do

First Person: My Restaurant's Groupon Experience Was No DealBy B.B. CrossPostsWebsiteBy B.B. Cross | Yahoo! Contributor Network – Fri, Jul 22, 2011

Contributor Network to start publishing your own finance articles. Groupon is a website that offers 50% discounts on select business offers as daily deals. It advertises that selling on Groupon can increase your revenue and provide advertising while getting you new customers at the same time. However, there are a few things you should consider before signing your business up for a Groupon.I used Groupon in January of last year, I decided that my restaurant could use the promotion and advertised a 2-person steak meal at half price. I was hoping to get a few hundred hits and then offer the clients a 15%-off deal for the next three times they came in. It seemed like a great way to get new customers and then keep them coming back.Then things went wrong. Within the first two days Groupon sold 500 of my discounted steak meals. I called them and asked them to limit the number of sales, then said that they could not and that I was bound by contract to honor the certificates.After lowering the cost of my food to retail price I discovered that Groupon was getting 50% of the sales. That meant that I was only receiving 1/4 of the cost for the meal! I then discovered that I was going to be paid in installments over the entire period of my Groupon advertisement and that any credit card fees would be taken out of my share.By the end of the contract I had lost nearly $4,000, with the cost of paying employees, heating grills and buying the food to serve, I simply could not afford to sell so many steaks at that price.While Groupon is a good advertising tool, I noticed that most of the people who came in were not interested in the restaurant so much as the fact that it was cheap. Many of them didn't return and I can only assume that they wandered away to visit Groupon's next daily deal.I also noticed that many of the people who came in with certificates were already regular customers, therefore I was not getting new customers, only giving food away to dependable ones. I did actually receive a few new customers, but not may. The first rush of customers when the Groupon ad was placed was hectic and hard on my employees, and then having to deal with each person who had purchased a coupon in the coming months was even more trouble.While I am sure that Groupon is beneficial to some businesses, especially the bigger ones, for me it was a disaster and I will definitely not be doing it again.

Sounds like a series of business errors, not a Groupon mistake.  Also, if customers did not return -- maybe the food was not so hot.  Just sayin'.....

I think this partly the business' fault. Did they not read their contract and see Groupon was going to take 50 percent? Didn't you see the promo was unlimited? If you have a business and you lose money because you didn't read the fine print, that's nobody's fault but your own. This sounds like sour grapes from someone who didn't want to pay their 50 percent Groupon bill.

I bought a Groupon Coupon for the first and the last time. I was so #$%$ that I did not use it.It was for a local restaurant in Austin, it serves buffet for under $10.The coupon was for $10 and you could eat $20 of Food.However, after the purchase, the groupon told me that this coupon is not printable for 24 hours. Then the coupon was not good for buffet, drinks or tips. It had another restriction that I have to be alone at the table.What nonsense.Screw groupon.

This is not the first groupon horror story I heard. Google them for yourselves and you'll see. Sooner or later word will get out that Groupon is unsustainable.  I'm willing to bet heavily that Groupon will not last more than 5 years.

This is true for most promotions. Most advertising, marketing and promotions are not effective and do not deliver an ROI.

Sorry, but I find it surprising that as a business owner, you didn't know the terms of the contract before you signed it.  How could you be "surprised" that Groupon was getting 50%? Didn't you ask how many certificates were allowed to be sold? It's hard to feel sorry for a business owner that gripes at the results of a contact, yet didn't do due dilligence to understand what the heck he was signing.

Did you read the "fine print" disclosure that would detail your fees and % of the sale?

Its still cheap advertising. Although a business owner can limit the number of participants in any offer, thousands of people get to read about the business. When else can you put out a coupon for only 500 people that is read by 100,000 people? 
I can't disagree with your experience because it was YOUR experience but it seems like some of these issues should have been anticipated. As for the return visitors, if they food is good, many will come back.

In normal fashion in our society today people just blame someone else for their own mistakes. Why not be honest and say that you messed up when you formed the contract with groupon when you didn't set a limit as to how many they could sell. It should be lesson learned and move on but no you have to come on here and blame someone else.

Niger: Gadhafi security chief enters capitalBy DALATOU MAMANE - Associated Press | AP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

NIAMEY, Niger (AP) — Senior members of Moammar Gadhafi's regime crossed in convoys from Libya into neighboring Niger on Tuesday, with the toppled Libyan leader's own security chief at the head of the first column to roll into the capital, officials said.U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said some senior members of the Gadhafi regime were in the convoy that reached Niger."But we do not believe that Gadhafi was among them," she told reporters. "We don't have any evidence that Gadhafi is anywhere but in Libya at the moment."The U.S. had no evidence to suggest that Gadhafi family members were in the group, either, she said.Nuland said the U.S. has urged Niger authorities to detain any individuals who may be subject to prosecution in Libya; confiscate their weapons; and impound any state property — such as money or jewels — that were illegally taken out of the country.Customs official Harouna Ide told the AP that Mansour Dao, Gadhafi's security chief, was at the head of the first convoy. He said other Libyan convoys were south of Agadez in central Niger, a desert country bordering Libya and where Gadhafi has the support of many Tuareg tribal fighters.It wasn't clear if Gadhafi family members were in the convoys but al-Arabiya television quoted Niger's Foreign Minister Bazoum Mohamed as saying Gadhafi himself was not present.Assarid Ag Imbarcaouane, an official from neighboring Mali, said a convoy was carrying Gadhafi's entourage. Imbarcaouane is second vice president of the National Assembly of Mali and is a pro-Gadhafi Tuareg leader."As far as the information I have received, the Guide is not in the convoy," he said, referring to Gadhafi. "Rather, it's the people in Gadhafi's entourage."The customs official said there were a dozen vehicles in Dao's convoy, and that among passengers were about 12 Gadhafi officials, Tuareg rebel leader Rissa ag Boula and other Tuaregs from Niger who had gone to Libya to fight for Gadhafi.Abdoulaye Harouna, owner of the Agadez Info newspaper, said he saw one of the groups arrive in his town Monday in several dozen pickup trucks. They headed for the capital, Niamey, a drive of some 600 miles (965 kilometers). The capital is in Niger's southwestern corner near the nation of Burkina Faso, where Gadhafi has been offered asylum.Harouna said he saw the Tuareg leader Boula in the convoy. Boula is a native of Niger who led a failed war of independence on behalf of ethnic Tuareg nomads a decade ago before seeking refuge in Libya.A representative of the Libyan rebel's National Transitional Council in Sirte, Hassan Droua, said he had reports from witnesses inside the city that a convoy of cars belonging to Gadhafi's son Moatassim had left Sirte, heading south toward the Niger border, after they were loaded with cash and gold from the city's Central Bank branch.The government of Burkina Faso sought to quash speculation that the convoys would proceed to that country, west of Niger. Foreign minister Djibril Bassolet had said last month that the landlocked West African nation would welcome Gadhafi. But Communications Minister Alain Edouard Traore went on state television Tuesday night to say : "We have heard nothing about (Gadhafi's) whereabouts ... But if he were to show up at our border he will be treated in keeping with international law."Both Niger and Burkina Faso are signatories to the International Criminal Court, which issued an arrest warrant for the Libyan leader, his son and the country's intelligence chief. But both nations also belong to the African Union, which in July called on member countries to disregard the warrant. The AU and many African leaders have become increasingly critical of the court, accusing it of targeting Africans. But Gadhafi and Burkina's President Blaise Compaore fell out years ago."There is no longer a Guide in Libya," Traore said. "We have recognized the NTC."Western officials said they did not have any information about the convoy. Harouna, the newspaper owner, said the pro-Gadhafi troops accompanying Boula were heavily armed.Gadhafi's regime is believed to have financed the Tuareg rebellion in the north of Niger. African nations where Tuaregs represent a significant slice of the population, like Niger, have been among the last to recognize the rebels that ousted Gadhafi.Gadhafi remains especially popular in towns like Agadez, a Sahara Desert market town where a majority of the population is Tuareg. There, the ex-ruler is remembered for his largesse and for his assistance to the Tuareg minority during their fight for autonomy.Harouna said the pro-Gadhafi soldiers accompanying Boula were coming from the direction of Arlit. The desert that stretches north of Arlit borders both Libya and Algeria. Some members of Gadhafi's family, including his wife, his daughter and two of his sons, recently sought refuge in Algeria.Gadhafi, who ruled Libya for more than 40 years, has been on the run since losing control of his capital, Tripoli, last month. The rebels say at least two of his sons had been in the town of Bani Walid, one of the last remaining pro-Gadhafi strongholds, in recent days. Moussa Ibrahim, Gadhafi's spokesman and one of his key aides, was still believed to be in the town, rebel officials said.Thousands of rebel fighters have surrounded the town as their leaders tried to negotiate a surrender.Most of Libya has welcomed the uprising that swept Gadhafi from power, though rebel forces backed by NATO airstrikes have yet to capture loyalist bastions like Bani Walid, Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte and the isolated southern town of Sabha.The rebels have extended to Saturday a deadline for the surrender of Sirte and other loyalist areas, though some rebel officials have said they could attack Bani Walid sooner because it has so many prominent loyalists.___Associated Press writers Rukmini Callimachi in Bamako, Mali; Angela Charlton in Paris; Matthew Lee in Washington and Brahima Ouedraogo in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso contributed to this report.

All these excess power on backward people of Libya shows the arogancy and ignorance of NATO people. Today the world needs an other great power to counter act such action  against people of Libya. Africans need to be united in to one solid idea to be against action of NATO and the like. It is time to arm all children of Africa to have united position against all evel action in the name of deplomacy, globalization and so forth. Before all fail in to hands of the old colinzers; Africans should stand united.

Looks like N.A.T.O. will have to bomb Nigeria in order to save those people from Gadaffi, well maybe not unless Nigeria has oil or some mineral wealth. Got oil or minerial wealth? democracy will come for a visit and the corporations will stay.

Really? the uprising was a popular movement? then I was wondering why did the CIA feel the need to ferry in about 5000 fighters from Afghanistan to conduct operations against Libyan forces? what a bunch of poppy #$%$ yahoo does eaxctly what CNN and the BBC's and the FOX's TV do! tow the progandist line the government wants them to toe. Truth is Libya did nor start a fight against the West the WEST DID!, I am no fan of Ghaddafi either but to rout him like this from his own country and lead the libyans to this complete strife like situation with no civic services left in tact? THE WEST is trying to hold on to its imperialistic lead over countries THAT IS ALL IT IS ALONG WITH  A 'RENEGOTIATED' Oil contract agreement file which reallocated all oil contracts to WESTERN companies......Shame on the West frankly, use to be a very nice place where some element of a justice system existed. Westerners have to realize that once these countries are plundered YOU ARE NEXT GET READY TO FORK OVER ALL FREEDOMS to the Western Corporations.

Under Ghadaffi Libya became a GIANT OIL SELLING CORPORATION devoid of civil rights and democracy. Libya's citizens became nothing more than Ghadaffi oil company employees with Ghadaffi as the dictatorial CEO.....dictating his insane policies to the Ghadaffi oil company citizen-surfs below him, who had no vote and little power. This is a prime example of corporatism run amok. Now we can see quite clearly what happens when you run a nation like a private corporation....it soon becomes like a private prison, with the inmates pushed to rioting and warfare to achieve justice/humanity. U.S. citizens should pay close attention to this...we have a few Ghadaffi wannbies here, who are hoping to turn the U.S. government into a private/corporate fiefdom.

The U.S.,NATO must have let them go (in $ecret of course) or the freedom fighter$ that surrounded them sold out. Now everyone has an excuse to limit freedoms there as the "threat of war and terror" from Gaddafi forces across the border will go on forever, just like in U.S..

America, CIA, and NATO cannot do politic, peace talk, or business. They are strong! They have conventional bombs and atomic bombs. They have intelligence of Guantanamo. Is this not scary?

If Gaddafi's security chief and his entourage have left Libya, you can be sure that Gaddafi didn't stay in Libya either. He and his entire family have left the country after making a deal with European leaders. I'd bet the farm on it. His new host country is poor. They can use of few tons of the gold that he looted from Libya, and they will. 

It is going to be difficult for him and his sons to live in a landlocked place surrounded by desert, with no say in the affairs of that country. They are not used to not be the bosses living in luxury palaces by the sea.

Without Russia to balance world politic NATO is now acting like a bully telling nations rich in oil who should be or should not the leader.   

The biggest lie for this invasion of Libya - NATO bombing Libya to save civilian lives.  It is more like NATO lead the invasion of the Libya.

Round up all the people in the convoy, and go past them one by one, just to be positive, and if any relations of Gadhafi are found, shoot them in the head on the spot.

I for one hope he makes it safely to Niamey, a true oasis in the desert and quite an enjoyable city. Furthermore I hope the government of Niger refuses any and all overtures to repatriate him to anywhere and offers full and unconditional sanctuary. As for all you uneducated and misinformed pap swallowers like Oily tats and Charles S. It is obvious you don't know what you are talking about so it would be best if you just refrained from making any comment at all.

Amazing the number of people who liked Ghaddafi.  A murderous thug and yet he is liked and admired.  I suppose this was the reason that Hitler was so loved in Germany.

OUTRAGE!     Yesterday we learned that the CIA has been sending prisoners of war to Libya to be tortured there by Libyan forces under the Bush/Cheney rendition program. One side of the mouth says the Libyan government must be overthrown due to human rights abuses. The other side of the mouth says, here Libya, do the dirty work for us-torture the prisoners and give us the information you get. What is the point of reading/listening to the news when we are fed lies by our government. CNN is nothing more than a government chill. Gen. Michael V. Hayden is a contributing editor to CNN. He is the one that gives us all the CNN insight into Libya. But, he was also the head of the CIA during Bush/Cheney.

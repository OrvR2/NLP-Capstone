STOCKHOLM — Stefan Liv, the goaltender who helped Sweden win gold medals in the Olympics and world championships in 2006, was among those who died Wednesday in the crash of a plane in Russia carrying a top hockey team. He was 30.
Swedish Ice Hockey Association chairman Christer Englund told The Associated Press that Liv was on board. At least 43 people were killed in the crash in Yaroslavl.
Liv was a left-hander with quick moves who played for the Lokomotiv team. In addition to the double gold medals in 2006, he helped Sweden win the world championship silver medal in 2004 and bronze medals in 2002 and 2009.
Liv is survived by his wife, Anna, sons Herman and Harry, and his parents.

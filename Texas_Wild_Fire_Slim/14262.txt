The Guard Film  Showing

September 10th, 2011 in Celebrity News
No Comments →
 







It is not frequently I go into a film guessing it’s only going to be very well, when truly everything about it appears to tell it is going to be beautiful damn fine. I do not experience wherefore that was the case with ‘The Guard’, but it just was. It screened out at this a long time internationalistic movie Festival, and regular although I dropped a lot of movies overdue to time, and Guard ‘was marked as one might see if I could, even the batter’s eye when I had to drop the first round of cuts in my program. Again, I can not explain why it is so, because it was a great cast, and the trailer was decent, but I think he just did not grab my balls for some reason. However, even when I was in line today to see “Hannah”, I noticed that the “Guard” was still in the game, and something just came over me to see it, so I did and I went just hoping that didn t the decision ‘bite my ass.
“Sgt Gerry Boyle is an Irish small town cop with a personality conflict, subversive sense of humor, a dying mother, a penchant for prostitutes, and absolutely no interest in the international cocaine smuggling ring that laced straight The FBI agent Wendell Everett at his door. ”
Well, it’s so good when you go to a movie and about to go out thinking, “why on earth I did not think that it will not be as good as it was? “Because that’s exactly what this film was. It was great! It was fun, intelligent, good pace with some interesting twists, if you can call them that, and had some good one-liners that I was chuckling to myself in the theater. All this was just a big and a little different, the comedy, which I think most people will get a kick out of. However, I would say that the film might have been useful in some places the heavy Irish accents were a bit hard to follow in stages.

The greatest misconception about in-migration is that it is a zero-sum game–that there is a finite amount of businesses which immigrants “accept” from the native-born and that immigrants consume cultural services without paying up anything in. Different nation governments–including Arizona, Alabama, South Carolina, and others–have purchased into this myth, acting out meters to call what they comprehend as jobs rising from undocumented in-migration. Yet anti-immigration laws injury not only immigrants, but native Americans as well.Alabama’s new immigration law of HB 56 employers clearly hurt. Article 15 of the law punishes employers who knowingly or intentionally hire illegal immigrants. The escalation of penalties for each offense. Violation occurs first in the heat of all undocumented workers, business licenses suspended for 10 days, and administrative penalties. For a second offense, the Alabama state government revoked all licenses and permits the company to where the infringement occurred. For a third offense, the government permanently revoke all licenses of the company of all its premises across the state – the destruction of business. (This section of House Bill 56 which calls the business of the death penalty and is based on a similar article in the Arizona immigration law against SB 1070 and the Law on Legal Arizona Workers).
Laws such as HB 56 also hurt farmers. Undocumented immigrants are a major source of manpower for the agricultural sector of Alabama, which brings over $ 5 billion a year the GDP of the state. In neighboring Georgia, where lawmakers recently passed a law similar to HB 56, the farmers are facing a serious shortage of work, by setting $ 300 million trees planted fruits and vegetables in danger of Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Producers Association ‘. Without access to low-skilled labor, many farmers will stop planting, to reduce the area under cultivation or planting less profitable crops starts that can be repaired by expensive cars.
Solution of Georgia to the shortage of labor has been the recruitment of criminals and probation as agricultural laborers. Benito Mendez, team leader for a crew of pickers Hispanic, said: “It’s not going to work … No way if I’m going to depend on the people of probation I can not get the pop up … “As a professor of economics Alexander Tabarrok argues, Georgia Immigration Law” transformed the workers in good criminals and criminals are bad people, losing on both ends of the agreement. ”
Construction in Alabama, is also getting pummeled by HB 56th James Latham, executive director of WAR Construction Inc. in Tuscaloosa and president of the Alabama Associated Contractors, is concerned about the exodus of undocumented workers would slow down construction projects . He said: “We see smaller herds, and the work takes longer to get over, because fewer workers available.”
HB 56, and the laws, as also hurts in the world and American economies. The immigrants come from countries where labor is plentiful, but the chance is low. America, relatively free market “premium seat”, which is to increase wages for immigrants. The economists Michael Clemens, Claudio Montenegro and Lant Pritchett shows that immigrants, guided instruction, and other factors, see an average of five times the wage increases by moving the United States
More consumers greater purchasing power is good for business all around. Clemens wrote recently in the Journal of Economic Perspectives that unlimited immigration would increase world GDP from 50 to 150 percent. This is a huge increase to 97.5 $ 32.5 trillion in annual world production. Most benefits will benefit immigrants themselves, but billions of dollars will also benefit Americans. While lower barriers to immigration of a small, will contribute significantly to U.S. economic growth. Every day we delay the cost of economic reform.
Immigration is like other professions voluntarily between two parties – both sides benefit. Immigrants earn more money, employers have a larger talent pool to choose from workers, consumers benefit from lower prices and greater entrepreneurship, innovation and services, and many Americans see their salaries.
Immigration is mutually beneficial. It is not a zero sum game, rather than a charity for poor foreigners. The government should leave the road and let the Americans and immigrants work together to help each other.

Seattle Times Ken Lambert photographer  on 9-11

September 9th, 2011 in World News

First noblewoman Laura Bush and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., President of the Senate wellness, teaching, Labor and pensions off citizens committee, look for short arguments later their listening, wherever Bush was to prove Tues, September. 11, 2001, on Capitol Hill in Washington. The listening was deleted later 2 planes went down into the global Trade Center towers in New York. The Russell Senate Office constructing, where they built their argument, was evacuated thirty minutes after.Often I do not remember what tasks I shot the day before. Things to run together after decades of doing photography journal, another press conference, business portrait or task support. Sometimes I do not remember the afternoon, which I shot this morning. But 10 years later, I remember almost everything, from September 11, 2001.
I was a photographer for the Associated Press in Washington, DC, covering the Capitol today. I had heard the first plane while driving in the field of Dirksen Senate Office Building parking lot, but I had not heard from the background. I was informed by my editor soon, the assignment to go with veteran J. AP photographer Scott Applewhite, covering the First Lady to testify on Capitol Hill before a committee of education. Applewhite took the train to New York while I stayed with Laura Bush. But the train has never been Applewhite Baltimore, and the ear of Senator Kennedy Committee was canceled.
The first image is a Kennedy, and Mrs. Bush will make a brief statement before the Senate Russell Office Building was evacuated. I stayed with the First Lady Kennedy in office as long as I could, but as they are pushed back, away down the corridor of the Capitol Police. In the distance, I heard a loud, fast becoming a march in the marble and see armed paramilitary squad in black helmets and bulletproof vests storm the office of Kennedy. They had at least 10, and were fast. The team was Mrs. Bush, and rushed down the stairs in less than a minute. I tried to get the picture, but fencing between the officer and the distance, I did not have anything useful.
When all the buildings were sealed, I worked a mixture of Capitol Hill police outside, saw in the second photo. Many looked like they were called before their shift. Normally, agents are perfectly pressed white uniforms, but many were in tee-shirts. They knew what the rest of us did not: The Capitol was a likely target. At this point, I did not know the Pentagon.
I tried to send pictures, but it was a frustrating task. My cell phone did not work, so I went to a church for the use of a fixed line, but shifted. Then I went to a bar and tried to use my new cell phone. Then I glimpsed the Pentagon in the smoke and flames on television. The angle makes it appear that the whole building is gone. At that time, I lost control for a few minutes. I just closed. I packed all my stuff. The loss of life was confusing and that the number of someone who had recently come out possibly included in the armed forces. I knew I had assignments at the Pentagon. I could not help thinking that he might be dead. Fortunately, I later discovered that he had worked in another building during the day.
I can not remember what happened next, but I think he was allowed one minute on a mobile bar because I remember talking to my editor briefly. On top of personal frustration and anger, he broke for a while. It was embarrassing, but something that could not control. My editor was nice about this, I was grateful. I recovered and started on a residential street and knocked on doors until someone let me spend in your phone line. I called two close personal AP others to join me, and sent their photos too. We all knew that our business is essentially a low priority. We were not the main story was. Once we understood the scope, we plan to return to the Capitol to keep an eye on him, but now all planes were grounded. I stayed in the Capitol at night.
I remember other details: Watch and gasping fell to a CNN live broadcast of Kennedy’s office as the first tower and get a hotel room near the end of the day with other photographers would have a place of transit. Later, I covered members of the House and Senate that displays unity in the Capitol steps, where I photographed embracing a Republican and Democrat, saw the third picture. The last image is in a moment of prayer.
After checking in with my family, I did something every day. I have seen pictures of New York, the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania for the first time. I was tired, but had to see the photos. They were wonderful life photojournalism covering the events of hell, all shot in 12 hours.

																Your children will learn the history from school. What they will not learn from school is how to grieve without being overwhelmed by it. How to take hold of tragedy and make the world a better place.                            







Serene Jones: Hate and Hope


		                        
																How is it that both greater freedom and hate-filled intolerance resulted from the attacks of 9/11? We must acknowledge the wound inflicted on this day have not healed, but festered.                            







Cindy McGinty: Remembering and Paying Tribute on 9/11


		                        
																Sunday is Sept. 11 and I can hardly believe it has been 10 years since Mike died. I can still remember very clearly where I was that day and exactly what I was doing the minute my life changed forever.

				No network can top what the Discovery Channel accomplish­ed - Rising: Rebuilding Ground Zero was jaw-droppi­ngly amazing.

No matter if you are a Dem or Repub, liberal or conservati­ve, independen­t or libertaria­n, if that series didn't make you proud to be an AMERICAN, I don't think anything will.  It captures every emotion imaginable related to that fateful day - a feat not easy to accomplish on tv these days.

The series will leave one simply inspired and can be seen in its entirety this Sunday (and no, I am not employed by Discovery)­.

				My sympathies to the families, but why fetishize these deaths over others in our national discourse? We felt so 'hurt' we had to hurt not only 100,000 Iraqi civilians, but some 4400 of our own dead soldiers and 33,000 disabled veterans for Iraq. I want to do anything we can for the victims of this day, but we lost our minds. It's a day to remember, but not at the expense of our sanity.

To put it in perspectiv­e, cell-phone use in cars kills an estimated 2600 people PER YEAR, and we lost almost 500,000 people in the pursuit of automotive freedom since 9-11.

				I can get behind the phrases "What are you doing for Christmas?­",  "What are you doing for your birthday?" or "What are you doing for Easter?", but I cannot accept the phrase "What are you doing for 9/11?".  It's not a freaking holiday or special event.  It's the anniversar­y of a very bad day.  Would you ask someone "What are you doing for the day your daughter died?".  Not me.  It's a day for personal reflection­, not for "doing something"­.  It is pathetic that the media is trying to turn this into some kind of contest for who can be the best rememberer­.

				While I certainly understand the need to commemorat­e the lives lost on 9/11, I find it pretty morbid to spend all day fixated on it. Not because it's morbid to remember, but because I know that what we'll see on any channel we watch is the bombardmen­t of those memories. They'll show the towers getting hit, the screaming masses, the collapsing­, the burning wreckage, and they'll show it on a constant loop, all day long. As if we have forgotten. As if we could ever stop our brains from recalling those images any time anyone makes the mention of 9/11. What purpose does that serve but to stir the trauma in this country? We just keep yanking the band-aid off and tearing those wounds back open, and for what purpose? I feel like I'm stuck in traffic and I'm the only person who doesn't want to keep traffic up by immersing myself in the grizzly aftermath of the fifteen-ca­r-pileup on the shoulder. I don't care to see it. I know it before I get there. All I want is to say a prayer and move forward. Granted, media exposure or not, I'm going to be thinking about it all day. That's what has happened every other September 11th since 2001, at least. I just don't want to spend all of that day crying. What good would that do anyone?

I don't know. To each their own. I guess my grieving process is a private one.

				Oh crum, a whole morning of Brian Williams delivering his smooth funeral statements­. Gag. I am not sure this is FOR 9-11...but whatever..­..it is a hard day to remember after ten years, but somehow the drama is going to be far too much...we can count on that. Does it help the survivors? Or all of us that were in mourning for all of the victims? I don't think so...this forever bringing up 9-11 as tragic and heinous as that was/is....­does not help any of us move forward and heal. I don't think so on that either. Which does not mean that when it is mentioned, my heart remains still...it doesn't.

				Maybe they could discuss how those towers fell into their own footprints and then move to building seven.  Oh yeah, I forgot, it was the jet fuel that burned em up and caused their free fall.  Still don't know how building seven was able to magically free fall from a small office fire.  Don't they have sprinklers in those old buildings?  Wouldn't have those extinguish­ed any small office fire?  

Many of us still want the truth.  Many of us can't and don't want to hear the truth because it's too painful.  Many of us KNOW the truth.

Microsoft news and rumors... Microsoft is preparing to launch a Windows 8 specific Windows 8 Bing web app. The web app is being tested on Microsoft’s production version of Bing and is expected to be made available in some form for the Windows 8 Developer Preview. WinRumors revealed the homepage interface on Tuesday but we’ve since been able to access the mapping and search results pages of the new UI. Microsoft appears to be making the version touch friendly, indicating that the app will likely be part of the new Start Screen and user experience in Windows 8.

The Salton Sea is one of the world's largest inland seas as well as being one of the lowest spots on Earth, sitting at 227 feet (69 meters) below sea level. It is located in southeastern California just north of the rich agricultural lands of the Imperial Valley. The sea lies along the famous San Andreas Faultand occupies the southern part of the Salton Basin and an area that once was the prehistoric Lake Cahuilla.

La Niña, which contributed to extreme weather around the globe during the first half of 2011, has re-emerged in the tropical Pacific Ocean and is forecast to gradually strengthen and continue into winter. Today, forecasters with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center upgraded last month’s La Niña Watch to a La Niña Advisory.

Texas has warmest summer on record of any state. The blistering heat experienced by the nation during August, as well as the June through August months, marks the second warmest summer on record according to scientists at NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, N.C. The persistent heat, combined with below-average precipitation across the southern U.S. during August and the three summer months, continued a record-breaking drought across the region.

	        			        			          		USGS Announces “No USGS Digital Camera Certification Requirement”
		          			          	
						        








An increasing number of aerial imagery vendors are moving away from film cameras to cameras based instead on digital technology. Some in the aerial camera industry have long advocated that the OSL calibration of film cameras be revamped so that the OSL develops the capability to perform a calibration/certification of digital-based aerial cameras. However, USGS recently underwent a change in its mission scope and has decided not to provide certification of digital camera technologies. The December 2010 USGS Headquarters decision stated that the USGS is neither an advocate nor a certification governing body for digital camera technologies. A natural outcome of this revised USGS mission definition is that there will no longer be certifications for digital aerial cameras; therefore, any Government contract with the potential of using a digital aerial camera should remove the USGS certification requirement from their contractual language. The revised USGS mission also concentrates its resources on the broader topic of remote sensing technologies research. The USGS is planning a course-of-action to maintain expertise and to add value to the digital remote sensing technologies used in Federal agencies, Government at all levels, and industry.

	        			        			          		Total volume of Arctic ice shrank to record low in 2010
		          			          	
						        








Alaska Dispatch: The total volume of Arctic sea ice shrank last fall to the smallest amount ever observed during the age of satellites, according to a new study that used a ultra-sophisticated computer modeling program that incorporates ocean observations, submarine data, and space-age monitoring. But that 2010 record — discussed in a research paper still in press ( Journal of Geophysical Research) and reported around the world by a Reuter’s dispatch from a Greenpeace icebreaker — may be already threatened by this year’s polar meltdown. New estimates by the same team of scientists at the Polar Science Center of the University of Washington appear to show ice volume is now plunging faster than it did at the same time last year when the record was set. As of July 31, the last time numbers were crunched and posted online, the volume of sea ice appeared to be about 2,135 cubic miles — more than 50 percent lower than the average volume and 62 percent lower than the maximum volume of ice that covered the Arctic back in 1979, the scientists said .

	        			        			          		Geological Society - William Smith Meeting 2011
		          			          	
						        



The aim of this meeting is to bring together people from the remote sensing communities with those involved in the modeling and field observations of volcanic systems – whether active, or dormant; on land, or under the sea – in order to stimulate new interactions, and identify promising new directions. Each of these fields are growing rapidly: new satellite sensors and retrieval methods have opened up a number of remote-sensing tools (for detecting volcano deformation and measuring volcanic heat and gas emissions) which are now semi-automated and, in some cases, available on a daily basis. New sets of ground-based measurement techniques are yielding abundant high-frequency datastreams from active volcanoes, with many opportunities to merge observations with models. While models for volcano behaviour are advancing, what constraints do the new results from geodesy, field observation and geochemistry place on these models?

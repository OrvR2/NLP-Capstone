WEMBLEY, England — A Wales fan died after an assault was reported outside Wembley Stadium before Tuesday's match between Wales and England in the Euro 2012 qualifying, authorities said.
The London Ambulance Service said the 44-year-old man suffered a heart attack before kickoff outside the north London stadium and police confirmed that he later died in a hospital.
Six men, who police believe to be Wales supporters, were arrested in connection with the incident which is now being investigated by the Metropolitan Police's murder team.
The match went ahead, with England winning 1-0, and details of the incident emerged about two hours after the final whistle.
The emergency services were called to the north London stadium 25 minutes before the 7:45 p.m. kickoff.
Police said in a statement that officers were called "to an area outside Wembley Stadium following reports of an assault."
London Ambulance Service spokesman Alistair Drummond said its staff at the event "attended to the patient within three minutes."
"They treated a 44-year-old man who had suffered a cardiac arrest," Drummond said. "Extensive efforts were made to resuscitate the patient and he was taken to hospital."
The victim has yet to be identified.
 "Police believe they know the man's identity, but await formal identification and confirmation that all next of kin have been informed," police said. "A post mortem will be scheduled in due course. Officers from the Homicide and Serious Crime Command are investigating."
Cardiff City confirmed that the victim also supported the Welsh capital club which plays in the second tier of English football.
"Late on Tuesday night, details reached us concerning a tragedy where a Wales and Cardiff City supporter died at the match between England and Wales," the club said in a statement on its website. "Out of respect for the family of the supporter, the sensitivity of the situation and until full details and circumstances are ascertained, no statements will be made until deemed fit by the proper channels."

				IT'S A GAME PEOPLE!!!  What the $&^% is wrong with these hooligans?  This is insane especially considerin­g that soccer is one of the dullest sports that exists.  There's a reason why it's never really caught on here in America, there's not enough action.  The amazing thing is that these hooligans should actually listen to what Jerry Seinfeld once said in one of his standup routines regarding sports.  He said that essentiall­y, people are rooting for laundry because you might love a player when he's on your team but once he gets traded, and he's wearing another team's uniform, then you don't quite love him so much.  If these hooligans, along with all the other soccer fanatics in the world, took that into considerat­ion then maybe we wouldn't even have fights in the stands let alone murders.

				Before everyone starts going off on the rabid UK soccer fans...let­'s not forget the headlines from Los Angeles when Kobe won his first Shaq-less NBA title!  "The revelers were fairly quiet last night.  Only 3 people died!"  Similar headlines out of Chicago years before during the Michael Jordon era.  It happens all over the place.  There's rowdies wherever you go!

These are the best insoles, June 9, 2007


By Modern Blue Argonaut  - See all my reviews

  





If your shoes already have great arch support, but you are looking for cushioning, these are WONDERFUL! I have been wearing mine for year, and I would not go anywhere without these in my shoes. I need to replace them as they have worn out a bit, but I have not found one other insert that compares in quality and comfort to these. I highly recommend them!!!

Happy Feet, April 22, 2010


By Molly Mouse  - See all my reviews


This review is from: Dr. Scholl's Memory Fit Customizing Insoles, Women's Sizes 6-10 , 1 pair (Health and Beauty)


I've tried everything, including $400 custom orthotics, but this is the only insole that keeps my feet painfree. Finally, I can walk without pain. I have Metatarsalgia (ball-of-foot-pain) from high arhces and heel pain too and these feel like soft slippers on my poor feet. I can't recommend them enough.
 They last a long time, at least one year, and I have them in all my shoes now. Like all insoles, they take up a small amount of room, mostly in height, so I often buy shoes a 1/2 size larger to accomodate them. I cannot walk without them.
 I bought these in a drugstore, but the blue ones don't seem to be made anymore and the new ones are a tan color. But they work just as well, although they are more expensive.

Works pretty well in a pinch.  Not the greatest but do offer some comfort.

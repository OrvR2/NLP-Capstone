The Texas Interagency Coordination Center(TICC), located in Lufkin, is a cooperative effort of the Texas Forest Service, the US Fish & Wildlife Service, the US Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Texas Parks & Wildlife and the Nature Conservancy. Since opening in 1998, TICC has mobilized more than 40,000 emergency response personnel and hundreds of
aircraft and pieces of equipment from all over the United States to support disaster relief efforts in Texas. 


The TICC website is designed to provide the fire community with easily accessible information that will be a valuable asset in daily operations. Fire weather forecasts, fire risk assessments and drought indices are some of the tools that may assist in critical decisions; volunteer fire departments will benefit from the services described under the FD Assistance link and the state-wide mutual aid plan is readily available;  On-line schedules and registration are available for the Texas Interagency Wildfire Academies.

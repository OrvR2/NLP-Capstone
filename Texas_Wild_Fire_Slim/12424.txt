KOA Pet Policy
Close


Some visitors enjoy sharing the pleasures of camping with their dogs or cats. To ensure that
							all guests have a safe and enjoyable experience, KOA has established some guidelines.
Before You Go:
Call ahead. Check with the campground about its specific pet policies. Some don't allow pets
							in Kamping Kabins, for example, or may have limited pet units. Others don't accept
							particular breeds that insurance providers have identified as having a history of
							aggression.
Bring your helper. Service dogs are welcomed at all KOA Kampgrounds. (Leash and aggressive
							behavior rules apply.)
When You Arrive:
Good behavior is required. Dogs of any breed that are hostile or aggressive will be asked to
							leave the campground, along with their owners.
Bring the leash. Dogs must be kept on leashes no longer than 6 feet when outside their
							owners' vehicles or rental units. Do not leave a tethered dog unattended.
Remember manners. Constant barking bothers other campers. If your pet is too vocal, you'll
							need to find other accommodations.

"Join us on September 10 for Country music superstar Rick Trevino Concert & Camping!"
Meet Your Hosts






Open All Year
We are very excited about having Rick Trevino performing at Fredericksburg KOA on Saturday, September 10, 2011!
Located in the heart of the Hill Country, this beautiful KOA is within a few short miles of the area's best attractions. Exclusive shopping, art galleries, restaurants and weekend live music performances at Fredericksburg are only minutes away. Visit the acclaimed National Museum of the Pacific War on the edge of town. Settled by the Germans, the town has retained a rich cultural and architectural heritage and was voted one of the Best of the South small towns by readers of Southern Living magazine in 2006. Luckenbach, famous for its live country music, is 5 miles away. Just 2 miles away are Wildseed Farms and Trade Days, a 350-vendor flea market/collectibles shopping experience held monthly. And seven of the best vineyards, with tours and tasting rooms, are within 10 miles. After all the activity, return to your serene campsite, surrounded by grand old oak trees-and rest up for the next day's fun !

Meet Your Hosts

RVing has been a part of Randy and Lisa Snapp's lives since they were children.  In fact, they loved it so much that a few years ago they decided to open their own RV dealership.
"We would regularly use the local RV parks for our customers, and then decided it would be handy to have one of our own," said Randy.  "Now we have our dealership and park all in one!"
The Snapps enjoy their KOA, which they purchased in January of 2009, and go out of their way to make every customer's experience a pleasant one.
"We seize every day, expect the best and are grateful for all we've been given" Lisa said.  "We believe this reflects through our people, and ensures that our guests are comfortable and pleased when they visit us."


The couple spends as much time with kampers as they can, getting to know them and making sure that their needs are being met.
"When guests leave our kampground," Randy explained, "we want them to do so knowing that we truly appreciate their business and the friendships that arise through it."
In their off-time, the Snapps still go RVing when they can and enjoy, according to Randy, "Golf, golf and maybe a little golf."

 Do you want to know what other RVers are saying about our park? Read reviews at www.rvparkreviews.com or just scroll down on this page. We've provided actual comments from our customers...just last week! We have stayed at this KOA several times. It is always clean and constantly updated. Great location between Luchenbach and Fredericksburg.  Lisa and Randy were excellent along with the rest of the staff! They made my stay very welcoming. As matter of fact, I'll be coming back May 27th thru 30th. I can't wait!!! Thank you for an relaxing vacation.  Extremely friendly, helpful staff. Nice sites. Very well maintained. *The owners are friendly and helpful. Our location was extremely quiet and beautiful.   Really like this park - clean and friendly staff. We attended the Saturday night concert under the stars and really enjoyed. Thanks!  Thanks for a great visit. Your service department fixed my little problem perfectly. Randy is my new favorite singer. Lisa, I hope you feel better. We want to hear you sing next time. :-(  The park met our needs perfectly. Clean, shady, nice dog run. We would stay here again.  We had a great experience at the KOA in Fredericksburg, TX. Check in was easy and the man was very helpful. He found us a great place to park our enclosed trailer. Clean cabin and restrooms. We appreciate the hospitality. Thanks.  We stay at several RV parks regularly on weekends and this one is our favorite. The people are nice and the restrooms are the cleanest I have ever seen.  We had a wonderful time. The personal were very friendly and out last night there we had a concert outside. It was just wonderful. Easy excess to town, to Luckenbach and to the bat caves. Very clean, quiet and pet friendly. We really enjoyed our stay. Live music on Sat. nite was very nice. The campground has always been very clean and accommodating. 


Founders Award Received!
Again this year, Randy & Lisa Snapp, owners of Fredericksburg KOA, were presented with the 2010 President's Award for excellence in providing great kamping facilities for their guests as well as a highest level of customer service. Randy & Lisa & their staff continue to excel in the operation of their campground.  They wish to thank all their staff, workkampers & park guests for making this award possible.  Without the feedback of their customers, it would be impossible to know the improvements that have made a difference & the things that are important to the guests.

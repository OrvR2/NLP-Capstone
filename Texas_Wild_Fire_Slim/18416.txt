A Generous Fandom Thank you to all who have donated so far!  In just a few days, we've raised

Join Us! This cause is dear to the hearts of many Texans in our fandom who have found ourselves, our friends, and our families affected by the wildfires.  If you call Texas home and would like to be a part of our efforts to help, please let us know so we can list you as a host.  All we ask is that you encourage your readers, your favorite authors, and your fandom friends to contribute stories & donations to help the Texas wildfire victims begin to rebuild.
Texas is still burning

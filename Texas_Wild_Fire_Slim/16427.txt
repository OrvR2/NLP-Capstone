Make Ennis a priority for your shopping

Spotlight on … Bill Rhoten — actor, director
The founder and artistic director of the Ennis Public Theatre traces his theater roots back to an eighth grade speech class and a Bill Cosby comedy routine. “I still remember the teacher’s name — it was Mrs. Stages,” he said.

A way tolls end up being a benefit to us
The realization that the state has marked funds raised for work in another county for work here is an interesting one. Funds for State Highway 121, a tollway between Denton and Collin counties, will be used to prop up work here on the U.S. 287 Bypass. Our section of U.S. 287 was determined to be [...]

United Way hits goal
ter an arduous, months-long fundraising campaign, the Greater Ennis United Ways has met its fundraising goal of $300,000 with just days to spare. “I have enough preliminary numbers that I can say we made quota,” said Eliza Fulton, executive director of the Greater Ennis United Way. “In fact, we may go a hair over $300,000, [...]

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is providing a loan guarantee for a massive solar energy project that could double the number of glimmering solar panels on residential rooftops in the U.S.
The Energy Department said Wednesday it provided a partial guarantee for a $344 million loan to San Mateo, Calif.-based SolarCity for the SolarStrong Project, which seeks to place solar panels on 160,000 homes across 124 military bases in 33 states.
"This is the largest domestic residential rooftop solar project in history," Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a news release. "This groundbreaking project is expected to create hundreds of jobs for Americans and provide clean, renewable power to our military families."
SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive said the company already had started its first military base project under the program at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. When fully installed, about 2,000 military homes will be powered by solar at the base.
"It is super important to get the guarantee from DOE, and because of this we can now provide clean power at a lower cost than regular power in 33 states," Rive told The Associated Press.
SolarCity will own and operate the panels and work with private companies that run the military housing to install them.
According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, 138,600 solar systems were installed on residential rooftops at the end of 2010, and they generated about 637 megawatts of power.
If the SolarStrong project is fully implemented on the military housing it is targeting, it would add 160,000 more solar-powered homes in the U.S. The Defense Department is the nation's single largest consumer of electricity.
"By tapping into our abundant domestic solar energy to power base housing, the military is showing the rest of country that homeowners throughout the U.S. can help improve our energy independence by going solar," said Rhone Resch, president of the solar industries group.
Tim Newell, the managing director of the U.S. Renewable Energy Group, the private equity firm providing the loan for the project, said the project was a low risk for the government. SolarCity is already the leading installer and operator of panels on U.S. residences.
"It's important to remember that all of the capital (including the loan) for this project is being provided by the private sector," Newell said in an email. "DOE is only providing a guarantee for a portion of the project's loan in order to reduce the financing cost and make it possible to include more states and more military bases in the project."
The loan program has come under fire in recent days, after a solar company declared bankruptcy last week despite receiving nearly $528 million in federal loans.
Solyndra LLC of Fremont, Calif., was the latest in a series of failures in the U.S. solar business, which has been beset by oversupply and competition from abroad.
The bankruptcy has provided critics with further ammunition to criticize an economic stimulus program that has provided billions of dollars in seed money for solar startups such as Solyndra. The program is set to expire at the end of the month.
SolarCity's Rive said the SolarStrong project differed from Solyndra in several ways. Solyndra was a business just getting off the ground and was using the money to build facilities. SolarCity is already an established company, and the DOE loan guarantee will not kick in until after panels have been installed at specific sites.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee has subpoenaed documents relating to the Solyndra loan from the White House Office of Management and Budget. A major investor in Solyndra, oil billionaire George Kaiser of Oklahoma, was a fundraiser for President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign.

				It's funny how everybody - including me - is breathing fire at Obama for letting those smog regulation­s slide, but how many people even know he's implementi­ng this big solar energy plan?  This is why I still kinda back the guy.  I think he just gets a lot of flack for his f@(&-ups and people just don't give him credit for the good stuff he's done.

				Imagine where we would be if the nation had listened to Jimmy Carter?
Now that Obama is promoting solar energy are we going to make the same mistake again?
Imagine a solar panel on every roof in America. I know it wouldn’t solve it all but it would make a huge dent in the problem. Why can’t we come together and get it done? Who is holding us back from another Apollo type project that we all can get behind? Imagine the jobs that would be created.
Imagine a UNITED America.

				Economists are now thinking that our national expenditur­e in Iraq and Afghanista­n will be at least 4 trillion dollars.  Even at the cost of $500 per panel, this amount would put eight billion solar panels on our roofs.   The price of oil would be reduced, our air would be cleaner, and  our local economies woud be enriched from the manufactur­e, selling, installati­on, and maintenanc­e of these panels.

				This is all good but will not contribute much... unless they install a thousandfo­ld. Now, solar is getting cheap because of Chinese automation­. We need to invest like 100 billion into the machines that would make literally thousands of sq miles of solar panels (preferabl­y ones that are not too dark in color). We should enact a trade tariff... to prevent any more jobs loss, then build this advanced machine automation­.
Why do I want machines to take away RE manufactur­ing jobs?
Because that is the Only way to create a substantia­lly larger installati­on jobs base... to the tune of thousands of square miles per country. Imagine that... Problems solved!

				I think putting solar panels on individual houses and businesses are a much better solution for homes and small businesses­.  We do not need to rely on the grid to power the majority of homes and businesses­.  We do not have to expend a lot of money to beef up our grid.  Our energy costs would be cheaper in the long run because we're not paying a middleman.  Our economy would not be held hostage by the purveyors of energy as they are now.

If the government made low interest loans to us for renewable energy projects, with the conditions that they be manufactur­ed in the U.S., our manufactur­ing plants that were left vacant could be retrofitte­d, our jobless could be put back to work, and our economy could be revitalize­d.

				The other night on the "new" NPR sustitute for Bill Moyers Jnl indepth investigat­ive critique of our corrupt system, Charles Krauthamme­r announced that the California solar startup co for solar panels failed last week.  Then he sneered that this alternativ­e renewables idea is unrealisti­c and unfeasible­.

Of course the rest of the "new" usual suspects just sat there including the silver haired silver suited host.  Well, Charles, wld the fact that the U.S. Congress and Executive have neither the WILL nor the GUTS to invest in renewables have anything to do with a solar panel co in CA going bust bec of cheaper Chinese competitio­n?  If U.S. committed 100% to the technologi­es that are there ready and waiting it could be done.  

U.S. gives $40 to $100 billion in subsidies to Exxon/Mobi­l et al and must subsidize American Natural Gas ("fracking­"), "Clean" coal (read Duke Energy which is the major contributo­r to 2012 Dem convention in Charlotte NC), THAT'S what makes filthy fossil fuels cheaper.

Just commit that kind of subsidy money to renewables and that solar panel co in CA wldn't have gone bust.  China is biggest producer of solar panels.  Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. poins out U.S. has to great GIFTS, the southweste­rn deserts (solar) and the great plains (wind).  Just build new or revamp grids and we can be off and running.

				First of all, the subsidizes going to the oil and gas companies are nothing compared to the subsidies going to alternativ­e energy companies that taxpayers are also paying guarenteed loans for. Tax breaks energy companies get are the same tax breaks all corporatio­ns get.

Solar panels in the desert sounds like a good idea, but where are you going to get all the water required to keeps these panels clean?

				Lets do some math

$344,000,0­00 spread out over 160,000 homes = $2150 per home

At $2150 per home, and 114,825,42­8 households in the U.S. in 2010, it would cost $246 billion to give every household in the united states solar, clean, free energy. 

Obama's stimulus package, that did not work, cost over $1 trillion. Why can't every home in america have solar energy if we can bail out these huge banks and spend trillions on "stimulus packages" that don't even work?

				How did Obama's stimulus package not work?  Every economist says it worked.  Every republican says it did not.  If it wasnt obamas stimulus package then it would have been McCains except McCain admitted he did not understand economics.­... like most republican­s.

				and states used the stimulus money to shore up their budgets and delay laying off workers, which happened anyway.  The consensus among honest thinking people is that the stimulus wasn't big enough.  Of course at the outset he shld have done jobs before healthcare­.  Shld have done both simultaneo­usly but McConnell/­Boehner/Ca­ntor et al wld have none of it.  If your statement coming out of the gate is to announce the absolute intention of making Obama a one term President, that pretty much does the whole process and substance in.  Combine that with Obama's insistence on bending to a bi-partisa­n-ism that doesn't EXIST and you have.... NOTHING.

				This is a great example of how government spending can translate into increased prosperity for the average person.  The fact that he military will be buying large amounts of solar panels specifical­ly designed for houses will eventually make the price of solar panels and related equipment go down.  We all know the price of fossil fuels is going to go up for certain since they are finite resources.  When supply gets exhausted and demand goes up due to population growth, the price goes up.  We have plenty of material around the world to build solar panels and other clean renewable energy equipment.  This material is not used up or burned up like fossil fuels, so it can be re-used and recycled.  Even if you don't agree with the science of climate change, clean renewable energy makes economic sense because it is nearly unlimited in supply, cheap, clean, safe and can be generated locally even by individual­s.

				Heck dude, i'm in between house building projects. Not too many coming down the pike for some reason. I'm smarter than the average bear. A great worker. Been sick once in the last 23 years. Older but wiser and i'm the ridge monkey when the crane swings the trusses into place on the house. Plus when i crewed last, ('bout 5 years ago) i worked kids in their early thirties into the ground.

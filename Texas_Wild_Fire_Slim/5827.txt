As District Attorney spokeswoman Debbie Mesloh famously proclaimed in 2004, "being naked in San Francisco is not a crime." But if District 8 Supervisor Scott Wiener has anything to say about it, it might be a crime if you don't at least put down a towel first.
At today's Board of Supervisors meeting, Supervisor Wiener, whose district includes the Castro, will introduce legislation to protect public health standards from potential problems with public nudity. 
The legislation would require nude people to cover public seating (for instance, a seat on MUNI) with a layer of protection before sitting down. This can include a towel, a blanket or a Folsom Street Fair party flier. The legislation would also require people to put on clothing before entering a restaurant. Public nudity will still be ok in other establishments, but you'd better grab some shorts if you want fries with that. 
"San Francisco is a liberal and tolerant city, and we pride ourselves on that fact," said Wiener in a statement. "Yet, while we have a variety of views about public nudity, we can all agree that when you sit down naked, you should cover the seat, and that you should cover up when you go into a food establishment."

				Seriously? What is the point of introducin­g legislatio­n for something that doesn't happen anyways? This is pointless and a waste of time. C'mon Sup. Weiner, focus on the real problems of your district. Like the rise in muggings and anti-gay attacks in the heart of the Castro. Like the far-too-lo­ng empty storefront­s in the neighborho­od. Like busses turning down streets they have no business going on and running over innocent bystanders­. Stop trying to turn the Castro into Disneyland for just the A-Gays and the tourists.

				I do think it's a good idea to require some type of seat covering before sitting one's naked behind on seats that are used by the public.  Public bathrooms have seat covers for toilet seats and the same should be available for nude people.  All nude people are not clean or healthy just like all clothed people aren't clean or healthy.

				Of all the problems in SF, Mr. Wiener focuses on this.  Probably one of his A-Gay friends was personally offended, prompting this legislatio­n.  If it weren't politicall­y perilous he would try to ban nudity in public spaces.  Such a total tool.

				Having read only the article here I have to agree with Mr. Wiener on this one. Placing a towel on a public seat before dropping your naked booty is a health concern for anybody who may be next. Containing parts of your body which are involved with eliminatio­n of waste makes a lot of public health sense in places involved with food service and/or preparatio­n.

But when I am about to bite into my burger do I want to see someones hairy B a lls ? Yeah I will pass. Would I want to see a woman's beautiful naked curves while eating? Yep.

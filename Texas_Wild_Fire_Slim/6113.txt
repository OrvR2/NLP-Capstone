Medical students spend hours learning about human health, behavior and how to provide good patient care. But when it comes to caring for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, their training may fall short.
According to a new survey of medical school deans in the U.S. and Canada, schools spent a median of just five hours teaching LGBT-related health content. Some 33 percent provided no LGBT-related instruction during students' clinical years, which is when students receive the most hands-on training, and nearly 4 percent of schools reported not covering LGBT health at all.
"This survey confirms what we have said all along: Health professional training schools in general do not adequately address LGBT health needs," said Hector Vargas, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association, a nonprofit which aims to combat homophobia in the medical profession. 
According to the U.S. government's Healthy People program, such needs can include specific adolescent and adult mental health issues, drug and alcohol use, obesity and risk of sexually transmitted infections.
The authors of the new study -- which was conducted by Stanford University's LGBT Medical Education Research Group and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association -- did find that 97 percent of the schools surveyed taught students to ask patients if they have sex with men, women or both when asking about sexual history.
But fewer schools emphasized the difference between sexual behavior and identity -- just 72 percent indicated they teach students, for example, that some men may have sex with other men but still identify as straight.
"There's a bit of a disconnect there," said William White, a medical student at Stanford University and one of the study's authors. "That's a more nuanced and complicated question. It gets down to the idea of, 'Do students understand what it means to identify as [an LGBT individual] and do they understand that some people don't identify with a population, but can still have its risks.'"
Vargas added that the new study highlights the pressing need to improve "cultural competency" among medical professionals. Such competency encompasses a broad set of skills health care professionals need in order to provide high-quality care to patients, including being "welcoming" and "nonjudgmental" so that patients feel comfortable opening up.Some estimates suggest that LGBT patients are almost twice as likely as heterosexual adults to delay seeking health care or avoid it altogether.
The new study does indicate a slight increase in the amount of time spent teaching LGBT-related health care issues.
A 1992 survey sent to medical schools' psychiatry departments found that on average, 3.43 hours were spent on what the survey called "the topic of homosexuality" -- primarily in human sexuality lectures. Though the authors of the new Stanford study write that direct comparison between the two surveys is difficult given differences in methods and sampling, White said it is safe to say that there has been a slight increase in the amount of time spent on teaching LGBT-related health issues over the past two decades. 
But there is still a long way to go. White pointed out that 44 percent of the deans surveyed said their coverage of LGBT content was "fair" overall, while 26 percent said it was "very poor."
"That's a shocking finding," he said. "Because in medical education, we strive for excellence."

				The fundamenta­l role of a Dr is as teacher - to educate and explain to their patients the status of their health so that the patient can make an informed educated decision about their lifestyle and any necessary/­recommende­d treatments­.

Therefor, a good Dr must be able to understand and relate to their patients, otherwise the Dr is less likely to be able to effectivel­y communicat­e with them or understand their specific needs.

This is the essence of why cultural competence is crucial to the practice of medicine. This study is simply highlighti­ng the need to include the LGBT community in the list of important cultural competenci­es for all healthcare profession­als.

				When the chips are down and you have a real health problem, you want the doctor who knows how your body works and what medicine is capable of.  Nowhere in that skillset is a need for special LGBT understand­ing.  Cultural understand­ing?  Sure, but claiming that LGBT is somehow a "culture" is a stretch.  Physical medicine is a wonderful and incredibly complex science, a fact cheapened by those who would add a requiremen­t to pander to specific sexual identities or orientatio­ns.

				As a current medical student I beg to differ. My medical training benefits from the greatest diversity of patient population that I can be exposed to - and the better I am at being able to understand and communicat­e with the greatest diversity of people the better Dr I'll be.

Knowledge of clinical medicine is only as effective as your ability to communicat­e with a patient. It doesn't matter how much I know, if I can't effectivel­y communicat­e it to you then my skill as a Dr is limited.

Any healthcare provider worth their degree should understand the importance of  recognizin­g a group -ethnicity­, sub-cultur­e, whatever- that has the potential for specific medical considerat­ions.

				This is a huge issue, especially for the transgende­r community. 

I know a male to female transgende­r woman who was rushed to the ER. She had to explain several times why the question, "when was your last period" didn't apply to her.

Minor example, but there are some rare but serious complicati­ons of gender reassignme­nt surgery that doctors need to be aware of.

				As an openly gay psychiatri­st resident, I definitely feel there was little emphasis on sexuality and psychopath­ology. This was weird to me given that there is research clearly indicating that depression­, and other mood disorders, have a higher prevalence among LGBT youth. However - I would also like to state that this is probably MORE due to societal factors rather than biological ones, and thus, should be investigat­ed more in the realm of psychology­, not psychiatry­. But that it goes without saying that many psychiatri­sts are fairly ignorant of such specific issues that relate to depression and anxiety in the LGBT population­.

				Actually,  nature doesn't have any "morality or abnormalit­y". Nature just is. Biology does not have any "morals" either. 

Please refrain from exposing your ignorance. Homosexual­ity is a perfectly NORMAL, NATURAL phenomenon in NATURE. The reason why homosexual­s tend to be afflicted by depression and other mood disorders are more likely than not socially determined­, not biological­ly determined­.

Genes are only concerned about propagatin­g themselves­. They are not concerned how.

				There are jokes here in the comments but the article has valid points. When I worked as a Community Health Educator for 3 years, in order to ascertain risk levels for sexually transmitte­d diseases, it was necessary to focus NOT on who the clients were but on what they did. Therefore, it did not matter how they classified themselves­: gay, straight, bi, refused to say. What matters is what kind of sex they had and was it safe (protected­) sex; was it oral sex, anal sex, vaginal sex. To be effective, safe sex programs have to target the messages at the groups that do the activity.   One of the HIV organizati­ons in NY found that it was missing the boat with its safe sex messages by aiming the gay messages at gay guys. It found that about 10% of the men studied were guys who identified themselves as straight and many were married---­- but they had sex with men.

Likewise, on the female side, there are many nuances with lesbian women that providers need to understand and be able to manage effectivel­y; higher rates of breast cancer; higher rates of smoking.

Sounds like plenty of folks I went through high school with who were straight, gay, black, white, asian, lower middle income, middle income, upper middle income, good looking, average looking, not so good looking and everyone else in between.

"'Do students understand what it means to identify as [an LGBT individual­] and do they understand that some people don't identify with a population­, but can still have its risks.'""

Should male doctors treat female patients and vice versa?  Should black doctors treat white patients and vice versa?  Should gay doctors treat straight patients?  After all none of these types of doctors would truly be able to identify as the other who is the patient.

				Queer patients are more likely to have to deal with rejection by their families, or fear of rejection if they come out to someone.  These issues that might effect psychiatri­c treatment.  The issue of sexually transmitte­d diseases comes up because different forms of sexual activity can carry higher or lower risks for certain sexually transmitte­d infections­.  However, yes, for the most part, the health issues are the same.

As far as your comment about physicians­, who are different from their patients, goes, I think you missed the point.

				And your "pander to us because we are a minority" hurts your cause more then it helps it.

Face it the gay population is 3-7% at most.

So we should modify the teaching at medical schools ???

This pandering to special interest hurts the left as much as pandering to the hard core fringe right.

				Different population­s can have varying medical needs and priorities depending on a vast array of factors - genetic, cultural, lifestyle, education, income, etc, etc.

It's important for Dr's to understand these different potential characteri­stics in order to inform their diagnostic criteria.

But mostly its important for Drs to be able to understand and relate to their patients in order to better communicat­e with them. It doesnt matter how brilliant of a Dr you are if you don't have the basic cultural competenci­es to be able to communicat­e with and inform your patients.

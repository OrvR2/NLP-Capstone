July 27, 2011 – COLLEGE STATION, Texas – Texas Forest Service released a public service announcement this week featuring baseball pitching legend Nolan Ryan urging citizens to take personal responsibility in helping prevent wildfires. Since wildfire season started on Nov. 15, 2010, Texas Forest Service and area fire departments have responded to 15,788 fires that have burned 3,385,015 acres. Approximately 90 percent of wildfires in Texas are caused by people. Seemingly-harmless things like outdoor grilling, dragging safety chains behind a trailer, welding and building campfires can accidentally start a dangerous wildfire.“If people cause them, they can be prevented,” said Tom Boggus, director of Texas Forest Service.With persistent dangerous wildfire conditions predicted throughout the summer, unprecedented drought throughout the state and all but seven of Texas’ 254 counties under burn bans, Texas Forest Service urges Texans to continue to exercise caution when it comes to any outdoor activity that could cause a spark.The new public service announcement can be viewed on YouTube and on the agency’s website. It is also available to broadcast and media stations for download from the agency’s electronic newsroom.

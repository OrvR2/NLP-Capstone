NEW YORK (AP) — Republicans have scored an upset victory in a House race that started as a contest to replace Rep. Anthony Weiner after he resigned in a sexting scandal but became a referendum on President Barack Obama's economic policies.Retired media executive and political novice Bob Turner defeated Democratic state Assemblyman David Weprin on Tuesday in the special election to fill the seat vacated by Weiner, a seven-term Democrat who resigned in June.With more than 80 percent of precincts reporting, Turner had 54 percent of the vote to Weprin's 46 percent in unofficial results."We've been asked by the people of this district to send a message to Washington," Turner told supporters after the landmark win. "I hope they hear it loud and clear. We've been told this is a referendum. Mr. President, we are on the wrong track. We have had it with an irresponsible fiscal policy which endangers the entire economy."Weprin did not immediately concede.The heavily Democratic district, which spans parts of Queens and Brooklyn, had never sent a Republican to the House. But frustration with the continued weak national economy gave Republicans the edge.Turner has vowed to bring business practicality to Washington and push back on spending and taxes.The race was supposed to be an easy win for Democrats, who have a 3-1 ratio registration advantage in the district.Weprin, a 56-year-old Orthodox Jew and member of a prominent Queens political family, seemed a good fit for the largely white, working-class district, which is nearly 40 percent Jewish.But voter frustration with Obama put Weprin in the unlikely spot of playing defense. A Siena Poll released Friday found just 43 percent of likely voters approved of the president's job performance, while 54 percent said they disapproved. Among independents, just 29 percent said they approved of Obama's job performance.Turner, a 70-year-old Catholic, vowed to push back on Obama's policies if elected. He received help from prominent Republicans including former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, whose much-praised stewardship of the city after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks was recalled during the 10th anniversary of the attacks last weekend.Weprin became embroiled in New York-centric disputes over Israel and gay marriage, which cost him some support among Jewish voters.Orthodox Jews, who tend to be conservative on social issues, expressed anger over Weprin's vote in the Assembly to legalize gay marriage. In July, New York became one of six states to recognize same-sex nuptials.Former Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat, endorsed Turner in July as a way to "send a message" to Obama on his policies toward Israel. And Weprin was challenged on his support of a proposed Islamic center and mosque near the World Trade Center site, in lower Manhattan.The Democratic Party enlisted two of its biggest guns, former President Bill Clinton and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, to record phone calls for Weprin. And Democrats relied on organized labor and other affiliated groups to bring voters to the polls.The House seat opened up when Weiner was pushed by party leaders to resign after sending sexually provocative tweets and text messages to women he met online.The trouble for Weiner, who served seven terms, began when a photo of a man's crotch surfaced on his Twitter feed. He initially denied the photo was of him but later admitted it was.Weiner, who's married, resigned June 16 after two weeks of fighting off pressure to step aside. He apologized for "the embarrassment that I have caused" and said he hoped to continue to fight for the causes dear to his constituents.In a special election in May, Democrat Kathy Hochul won a heavily Republican upstate district after pledging to protect Medicare, the popular government health care plan for seniors.The state replaced outdated lever-operated voting machines last year in favor of paper ballots and optical scanners, which take more time to close and process. Polls closed at 9 p.m. Tuesday, and results trickled in slowly, but a Board of Elections spokeswoman said the vote-tallying system ran smoothly and there were no problems to report.___Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor and Julie Pace in Washington contributed to this report.___Beth Fouhy can be reached on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/bfouhy

Lets face it, both parties have spent tax dollars in support of their own agendas, we all do! The difference here is that the financial well has run dry because when we send all of our money out of the country for goods and services made someplace else there is less taxes collected. Our grandfathers were afraid of this day, the day that our own personal creature comfort became more important to us than our neighbors'. When we buy items made outside the US, jobs in that industry go with them. They will continue to go overseas and we will suffer the economic loss. Spending our limited tax dollars on make work jobs in the US is not the answer when there is no plan for permanent growth of US industries and commerce. Take this election as referendum if you want to, but the fact is that under the circumstances Democratic party values for big government will not work in this Global economy. What troubles me the most is that most liberals pride themselves on being keenly aware of the state of progress in the world and are more atune to what the needs of a growing population are. The fact that they appear to be stuck in the tax and spend mentality just proves the former to be fiction!

Yes we're tired of obuma policies. 800 billion wasted in his stimulus. Promises that unemployment would stay under 8%. He gave half a BILLION to a solar company that is now BANKRUPT.  His policies are despicable and destroying this country.  I did NOT like Bush and I HATE obuma. Get this virus out. And obuma stop playing politics. We just had this discussion about raising taxes during the debt ceiling and you FAILED. So why do it again? You dont do it in a recession. LOok at europe for what happens with your socialist policies. You are nothing but a campaign manager. You have no clue how to lead.

We are in standstill mode right now because of a split government not wanting to cooperate with the president. I'm waiting to see if the Repubs when the next presidential election. My bet is that they will raise taxes (on somebody) when and if they do.

There are those that can put something together and thier are those that only know how to tear apart and have nothing to offer in its place. If anyone votes on the presumption that the way Washington was running wasn't broke proir to obama, is a blind fool. These cheap claims of i'll do this or that without creative policy change will doom this country............
If we want status quo, then vote republican , if you want real change,even if its not the change that you'd wish for entirely, vote democratic in 2012.

GTFO 2012....the message can't be any more clear.  BHO declared war on the individual, small business, and the private sector.  We are obliging him in his wish for a war.  We got in the ring, we are exchanging blows, we are willing to go to the mat, and we are up on points.  BHO needs to apologize for declaring war.  We will forgive and we will get behind him.  But, he has to apologize and politely ask us to support him instead of pounding his hand on the table and demanding the house, "Pass the bill."

It's all Bush's fault.  His policies forced Anthony Weiner to send pictures of himself in his underwear.  It was all part of Dick Chaney's diabolical plan.

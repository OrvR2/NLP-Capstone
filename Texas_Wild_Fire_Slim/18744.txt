	Mom's View: Back-to-School!
 » ‎
	Falmouth Patch




Posted: September 12th, 2011, 5:46am EDT
Well, it's back-to-school time, woo-hoo! For all us moms, this time of year brings up a lot of emotions, both good and bad.
For me and my family, the new schedule is the best part. We know what time we need to be up, what time to go to bed, where who has to be at exactly what time, etc.
This year, I decided to give my children a little more responsibility. Instead of me being their wake-up call (especially because my oldest needs to be up by 5:30am) they actually have to set their alarm clocks and get themselves up now. I am an early riser and usually up between 4:30 and 5am during the school year, but I have my own stuff to do!
Much to my surprise, the first morning they both were quickly out of bed, dressed, and getting their breakfast right on time. On day two they were a little more sluggish, but still ready.
Now for the part that I'm sure many of you can relate to: like all of us, the kids need a few weeks for their bodies to acclimate to this new early-to-bed, early-to-rise schedule. They turn into monsters close to bedtime, and the mornings become a little less pleasant. I tried to get them to prepare for this the week before school started, but it just didn't work.
So for the first week of school I had about a 50-50 success rate; my sons were not able to coordinate everything simultaneously. One would set his alarm, while the other wouldn't. One managed to forget his bus pass and the list of his teachers the first day of school, which required a superhuman quick trip home in the pouring rain. My other son purchased nearly $100 worth of school supplies and decided five minutes before the bus was supposed to pick him up that he would start unwrapping and organizing (which could have been done in the many hours he was fooling around with his brother, playing Xbox, or chatting on Facebook the evening before) which left him no time for breakfast at home, so he inhaled it in the car.
So far we have made the bus every day on time (no chasing the bus around town like last year) and I haven't gotten any phone calls telling me they forgot a lunch or money or a paper that they need for a first-period class.
I would love to hear your September school stories; I'll be sure to keep you up to date with mine!

	Get Green Grass this Fall
 » ‎
	Barnstable-Hyannis Patch




Posted: September 12th, 2011, 5:46am EDT
It turns out, I have what is known in landscaping lingo as a “freedom lawn.”
To my neighbors, it’s not only a bit unsightly but the source of unwanted crab grass-creep onto adjacent properties. For me though, it’s an organic delight, free of hormone-disturbing herbicides and pesticides, and full of symbiotic nutrients. Indeed, the clover that mars my landscape is in fact one of the healthiest of interlopers on a lawn, removing valuable nitrogen from the atmosphere and depositing it down into the soil. Another “weed” that grows in my front yard is purslane, the only plant-based source of Omega-3 fatty acids (the ones you get when you eat salmon) and a popular delicacy in Mediterranean diets. I’ve also got an abundance of strawberries, minus the fruit, that is, as the bunnies help themselves to all of the ruby red strawberry buds shortly after they poke their heads through the greenery.
Still, every time I drive down Braggs Lane past a number of houses serviced by Vetorino’s Landscape & Irrigation, I get lawn envy.
With the days of scorching sun now behind us, it seems that now’s the perfect time of year to invest time and energy in an emerald carpet for next year. So I went to the experts down at Country Garden, and asked what I would need to do in order to make that happen.
“We really urge people to do soil tests,” answered the stores Manager, Craig Nelson, without missing a beat. Apparently the cliché goes - a soil test is the roadmap to a good lawn.
If you haven’t done yours already, there’s no time to waste, because a test takes time to get back and you want to allow your new seeds to take root before the frost.
Garden stores sell DIY soil test kits but at the risk of underselling a product, Nelson admits, “they don’t give you all of the information you need.” Instead, he recommends sending a sample of your soil to the UMass Soil Testing Lab, which costs $15 and currently has a turnaround time of about one week.
The Cape Cod Extension offers walk-in soil tests for $2, as well as sponsors soil test clinics throughout the Cape.
Nelson recommends running a soil test annually and applying the appropriate application (lime for a soil low in pH; an acidifier to raise the pH) until you get it back in balance (6.8 for lawns is perfect, he says), and then once every three years.
Once you’ve got your soil where it needs to be, it’s time to seed. Tall fescues are particularly suited to Cape Cod - flexible, drought resistant, thriving in conditions to full sun to part shade, and hearty. But most of us know that monocultures (large areas with a single type of planting) become vulnerable to disease and pest problems, and this goes for fescues as well. The Country Garden obliges with seed blends that mix in some rye and blue grass. The Cape Cod Special Mix costs $19.99 for a 5lb bag while the Eco Blend, which Nelson touts as providing “the highest output with the fewest inputs” costs $29.99.
If you’re starting a brand new lawn from seed, expect a 5lb bag to cover approximately 1,000 sq. ft. If you’re over-seeding an existing lawn, you should be able to cover just under double the area. And over-seeding is on of the best forms of weed control, filling in areas that would otherwise be susceptible to nature’s whimsy.
So here’s another little tidbit of which I was unaware. Turf grass roots can’t penetrate compacted soil, while crab grass, chickweed, clover and other types of uninvited guests just love it. “A dandelion will put its root through a brick wall,” Nelson says.
Solution: Aerate. Aerating the lawn allows oxygen to reach the root system, a critical element to the grass’ process of photosynthesis. In laymen’s terms, without oxygen, the grass will starve.
You can rent the machinery necessary to bore holes deeply and consistently in your lawn at Coastal Equipment ($70 per day) or leave it to the professionals. Landscapers offer aerating and over-seeding services as part of their regular lawn care maintenance or as a one-off service (priced according to property size).
“Sounds like a lot of work,” I said to Nelson.
“It is a lot of work in the beginning, but then it is self-sustaining,” he said, repeating his lawn-care mantra. “Mow high, water deeply but infrequently, do a soil test, aerate and over-seed.”

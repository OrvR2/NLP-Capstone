Texas Republicans want cuts to offset disaster assistance — including wildfire aid

Texas Republican lawmakers in Washington have said all federal funding for disaster relief–including for the wildfires currently ravaging the state–should be offset by equal cuts from other programs.
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, backed up House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s suggestion that disaster relief funding shouldn’t be borrowed, saying from the Senate floor that he believes “we can’t keep borrowing money that we don’t have.”
Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Rep. John Culberson, R-Houston, agreed.
“I strongly maintain that our government must stop spending money we simply do not have, and equal cuts and offsets in our budget should be made to provide federal relief to those facing the devastation of this horrific natural disaster,” Culberson said.
Rep. Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands, said in a written statement on Friday that Congress should use historical data to start budgeting for natural disasters.
“The reason Congress doesn’t include disaster relief in its budget is so it has an excuse to avoid paying for it,” Brady said.
The calls to balance disaster spending or set aside a special fund to pay for it come while Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst is urging President Barack Obama to issue a disaster declaration that he said would give Texas access to aircraft, bulldozers and other heavy equipment to combat wildfires that have burned nearly 3.7 million acres since the season began on Nov. 15, 2010.
The federal government has not approved Gov. Rick Perry’s request last week to have most of Texas granted major disaster status.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency so far has approved 26 wildfire-fighting grants, which it will reimburse to Texas at a rate of 75 percent–the same rate the state would receive without the disaster declaration. But Texas Republicans have said those grants aren’t enough to fight the growing blaze.
Perry’s office said in a letter to the president that the wildfires are so bad that the federal government should declare major disasters in 252 of 254 counties.
Available FEMA funding for fiscal 2011– which ends Sept. 30–was running low even before Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee damaged the East Coast. FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund has dipped below $592 million.
President Barack Obama asked Congress on Friday to approve a supplemental $500 million for the Department of Homeland Security–which runs the Disaster Relief Fund–to pay for emergency aid through the end of September.  He also asked to amend the fiscal 2012 budget to give the department $4.6 billion.
On Tuesday, the Senate appropriations committee approved a bill that would designate $6 billion to the fund in fiscal 2012, an increase of $3.35 billion above fiscal 2011. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has confirmed he plans to call up the bill next week.
Texas Republicans maintain that Congress should make cuts in other programs to add to FEMA’s coffers.

Three men were executed by hanging in Iran for "forbidden acts against religion," according to AFP.
Iran Human Rights explains that the state-run Iranian news agency ISNA reported that the men were put to death for acts against sharia, "based on the articles 108 and 110 of the Iranian Islamic penal code."
Articles 108 and 110 of the penal code are part of the chapter covering the punishment of sodomy, according to Iran Human Rights.
Murder, rape, armed robbery, drug trafficking and adultery are other crimes punishable by death in Iran, according to AFP.
In 2007, Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed there were no gay people in his country.
"In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country," Ahmadinejad said according to Think Progress. "We don’t have that in our country. In Iran, we do not have this phenomenon. I don’t know who’s told you we have it.”
In 2005, Human Rights Watch reported on the executions of two men for homosexual conduct.

				I haven't read all the responses here, yet, but I am sure a lot of them are slamming American rights for gays, religion, Conservati­ves, and probably even Christians­.

But I am still proud of my country and the progress we've made.  It is still a shame that it is a slow battle for my fellow American citizens who just happen to love someone of the same sex.  I am not ashamed to stand up for these beliefs.  I am a Conservati­ve Christian, myself, but I am a free thinking individual as well.

I pray (to my Christian God) that our society and Nation will evolve to the point where no-one cares whom another chooses to love, and that these changes happen sooner than later.

This tragedy in Iran is disgusting and horrible.  Let's use this as a reference point to chart our own progress and serve as an example to the barbaric practices of others.

It is my belief that love is love, no matter who shares it.  If two people happen to be of the same gender, it is NOT an abominatio­n... it is just a coincidenc­e!

				One day all men will come to see that we are all connected on the most intrinsic level. That the amount of pain one inflicts on the world around him is proportion­ate to that which he feels inside. When you hurt your brother, you hurt yourself and, if you believe, you hurt God. 

So much hatred on this article, it's expected considerin­g how utterly confused so many Americans are. How little so many really know about the nature of reality. Pick up a science book and read it. When you're done, read another. I suggest something about Quantum Physics. It will change your outlook. 

Before you say something completely hateful, look inside yourself and ask why you feel so much hate in your heart. There is love and then there is lack of love. Which are you?

				I'm currently communicat­ing with a young gay man in Tehran. He HATES Iran. Wants desperatel­y to get out but can't. He's well educated and quite intelligen­t. Wants to come to America to study "Theoretic­al Economics"­....whatev­er that is, but can't get a visa so he's trapped. Also frightened and lonely. The loneliness in his eyes is heartbreak­ing and he doesn't smile unless I cajole him into it. He's strikingly handsome and when he does smile, it's wondrous to see. But he lives in fear and danger. I've tried to offer encouragem­ent and support but there's so little one can do over the net.   
And they are truly kept ignorant. He didn't even know about Amadinijad­'s "no gays in Iran" comment, for instance. His response was to scoff and express hatred for the man, which is dangerous in itself because of their internet monitors. 
There are thousands of gays in Iran, emotionall­y starved and found by the hundreds on the social gay web sites. To a man, they want freedom from fear and loneliness­.

				To all you believers, GOD is a idea that was made by ancient people in order to explain the world around them. It was later used as a tool to control the masses via fear and artificial hope. It is particular­ly sad that this archaic belief system is still largely taught in the world today and is part of the reason this world as such a mess...

				The death of another always causes pause.  The level of punishment for crimes varies from country to country.  Each nation establishe­s its own laws.

In the U.S. we outlaw marriage intimacy between a woman and a man who is already married to another woman (polygamy)­.  In Iran they outlaw same sex intimacy.  Each nation determines its own laws and the punishment for violation.

Many in the U.S. voice concern, asserting Iranian law is immoral.  Many in Iran voice concern that U.S. law is immoral.

				Nathaneal, that's a good statement.  I've thought that many times.  I don't agree with homosexual­ity but I am really hard pressed to see Jesus mocking and oppressing sinful people.  I have homosexual friends and they know I don't agree but we are still friends nonetheles­s.

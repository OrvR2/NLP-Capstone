Lion tennis wallops Waxahachie on the road
At some point in district play, Lion tennis had to lose a few individual matches. It happened Tuesday in Waxahachie, but Ennis (13-2, 5-0) still easily disposed of the Indians via a 10-2 victory. “Waxahachie is the toughest district opponent we’ve faced and they played hard until the end,” said coach Keith Howard. “We had [...]

‘Pink Out Day’ in Ellis County
At Monday’s Ellis County Commissioners’ Court meeting the commissioners voted to make Oct. 1 “Pink Out Day” in the county. The day is to show that the county recognizes October as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and the goal of “Pink Out Day” is to raise awareness about the disease itself as well as early [...]

Negotiations pay off for the taxpayer
The city deserves credit for hard-fought negotiations that have ended up saving Ennis an arm and a leg on payments to the U.S. government for the cooperative project at Lake Bardwell reservoir. The lake is a huge resource for the city and county. Beyond serving as a necessary source of vital water, it’s a landmark, [...]

School spirit and team pride can be fleeting but the ladies of the Ennis High School Lionettes work together to make sure that doesn’t happen to them.

EPD&#8200;chief: Swafford a good cop
The Ennis Police Department officer under fire after verbally mistreating a prisoner on video is being unfairly targeted, his boss said. Cpl. Sherman Swafford has been criticized and reprimanded for inappropriate language caught on tape during an arrest this summer. Most recently, Swafford has been criticized for a previous firing linked to mismanagement of funds, [...]

8th Maroon Lions rumble over Reed, 48-0
The eighth grade Maroon Lions are a runaway E-train right now and their opponents don’t seem to stand a chance. Ennis (3-0) had its most dominant showing to date on Tuesday in its home debut against Duncanville Reed. The Lions led 32-0 at halftime and didn’t throw a single pass after that point in a [...]

The sound is the show
Somehow, I just didn’t expect quite as much physical force behind the sound that ripped through me at the Texas Motorplex on Friday. By comparison, Thursday’s racing action was like an alarm clock. There’s just nothing that I’ve ever experienced that comes close to the sound of those cars as the drivers slam the pedals. [...]

Shooting resurrects gun issues
Tuesday’s events at the University of Texas-Austin campus are certain to rekindle a longstanding public debate about the right to carry firearms on public university and college campuses. The fact that a 19-year-old student brought a high-caliber rifle on to campus, firing indiscriminately and killing none other than himself, doesn’t particularly change the debate or [...]

Bardwell agreement benefits Ennis
The city’s saga with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over cost increases at the Lake Bardwell reservoir has, for all intents and purposes, ended. After more than a year of appearances on the city commission’s agenda since a June 2009 notice that stimulus work at the reservoir would significantly boost annual costs for the [...]

Nonprofits’ tax status at risk
As many as 25 area nonprofits could be at risk of losing their tax-exempt status if they don’t file required tax returns by Oct. 15. The Internal Revenue Service released documents listing the local nonprofits in jeopardy during the summer — the listed organizations had failed to file required returns for 2007-09. Included are organizations [...]

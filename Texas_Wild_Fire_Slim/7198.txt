﻿WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama has telephoned Gov. Rick Perry, one of the Republicans who want Obama's job, to express concern for residents threatened by one of the most destructive wildfires in Texas history.
The White House says Obama made clear that the federal government will continue to provide assistance to state and local officials fighting the fire. Obama also assured Perry that requests for additional assistance would be quickly assessed.
Additionally, Obama has directed his national security staff to continue working closely with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Forest Service and the state of Texas to ensure that all resources are being made available.
At least two people were killed in the blaze, which was fanned by winds from Tropical Storm Lee. Nearly 800 homes have been lost.

Ahead of the Bell: Darden RestaurantsAP – Wed, Sep 7, 2011





NEW YORK (AP) — Two analysts cut their price targets for Darden Restaurants Inc. on Wednesday as the restaurant operator cautioned that its first-quarter earnings would miss Wall Street's expectations.Darden, which owns the Red Lobster, Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, said Tuesday that it took a hit from Hurricane Irene and lowered its quarterly earnings by about 2 cents per share. The Orlando, Fla., company now anticipates earnings from continuing operations of 78 cents per share.Analysts surveyed by FactSet forecast earnings of 84 cents per share.Alvin Concepcion of Citi Investment Research reduced Darden's price target to $52 from $62. Darden shares closed at $$46.18 on Tuesday.The analyst said in a client note that Darden faced difficult commodity cost comparisons during the first half of the year and was also pressured by weak Olive Garden sales and Irene.Concepcion noted that Darden had solid revenue at restaurants open at least a year through August, led by strength at Red Lobster and Longhorn.Revenue at restaurants open at least a year is a key gauge of a retailer's health because it excludes results from restaurants recently opened or closed.Mark Kalinowski of Janney Capital Markets also lowered Darden's price target, trimming it to $50 from $56. The analyst said the company's earnings guidance is well below his estimate of 90 cents per share.Concepcion and Kalinowski both kept "Buy" ratings.

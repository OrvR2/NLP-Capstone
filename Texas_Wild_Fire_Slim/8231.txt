Iran: Syria should hold talks with protestersAP – 13 hrs ago





LISBON, Portugal (AP) — Syrian President Bashar Assad should back away from his violent crackdown on protesters and enter talks with the opposition, Iran's leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Wednesday."There should be talks" between the Syrian government and its opponents, Ahmadinejad said in a live interview in Tehran with Portuguese broadcaster Radiotelevisao Portuguesa."A military solution is never the right solution," Ahmadinejad said, according to a simultaneous Portuguese translation of his comments."We believe that freedom and justice and respect for others are the rights of all nations. All governments have to recognize these rights," he said. "Problems have to be dealt with through dialogue."Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said last month that Assad should answer the legitimate demands of his people."Other countries in the region can help the Syrian government and people to talk to each other with a view to resolving their differences and introducing the reforms that are needed," Ahmadinejad said.Iran, Damascus' chief ally, has blamed the U.S. and Israel for instigating more than five months of protests in Syria.The U.S. and other nations have accused Iran of helping Assad crush the uprising."Other countries have no right to interfere in ... domestic discussions," Ahmadinejad said, citing NATO's intervention in Libya as an example of misguided actions.

If Americans think of themselves as so great, why does the whole planet dislike Americans.  Seems like yawl are living in a bubble.  Basically Americans are the trash that left Europe because they couldn't measure up.

Really Ahmadinejat. Go take care of your own people and country. The truth is, they know that once Syria falls, they are next. There is no other crappy regiem left other than them. So now they are trying to have Assad stay in power at any possible cost. During the green movement (revolution), Syria exported thousands of Hezbolah, Jihadist to the street of Tehran to kill and beat down Iranians. If they fall, who else will help them. Ghadaffi is gone, Assad is next and hopefully f-ing mullahs in Iran will be  next. The people in all of these countries deserve better.

Wolf Blitzer was showing a video tape of the latest atrocity on CNN's Situation Room about forty minutes ago. The footage showed Syrian forces shooting and killing an unarmed civilian. It was an execution of a very brave unarmed protester. Assad, who knows nothing of bravery and honor, is planning to kill every Syrian who dares protest for his or her freedom and the right to live with dignity and respect and in peace. Assad is now calling upon his father's former aides to advise him on the best methods for killing thousands more civilian protesters in order to break the back of the Syrian people's freedom movement. Things in Syria are about to get unimaginably bloodier and all with a wink and a nod from Iran.

This is stomach churning stuff but you should tune into Anderson Cooper's show at 8 pm or 10 pm on CNN if you want to see this footage and learn what lies ahead for these extremely brave Syrian protesters. They deserve our respect for their courage and they deserve all the diplomatic and militarily support that the United States can deliver even if we have to do it on our own.

Iran came out and finally said what's right....now it's time for the US to tell the Saudis and other gulf nations to stop interfering in Bahrain's internal affairs and for the Arab/Sunni rulers of Bahrain to listen to the majority Shi'ites who are oppressed daily there.

Anyone still need convincing that these "people" revolutions are anything more than a power grab by radical islam?  When Iran pleads your case, you know there's nothing but trouble ahead.

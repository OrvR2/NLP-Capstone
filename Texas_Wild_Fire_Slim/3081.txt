The past decade has largely been one of erosion for the U.S. economy: jobs lost, homes foreclosed on, gains in equality erased. And according to a new report from Policy Matters Ohio, wages too have declined in no less than 10 states, once adjusted for inflation.
"The first decade of the new millennium," Executive Director of Policy Matters Ohio Amy Hanauer, the author of the report, writes, "was a lost decade for America’s workers." 
Not only has unemployment increased substantially since 2000, but wages, adjusted for inflation, have grown by just 3.3 percent as well. By comparison, between 1990 and 2000 wages increased by 5.74 percent. And in states like Ohio, Michigan and Alaska, wages have actually declined over the past ten years, according to the report.
Rising income inequality over the past three decades may be partially to blame, Hanauer writes. Indeed, according to The Atlantic, two of every three dollars of income growth went to the top 1 percent of Americans between 2002 and 2007. In Ohio, the state which saw the greatest decline in wages, only the top 10 percent of earners have seen income growth in the past decade.
But It's not only in these 10 states where wages have suffered. According to the Economic Policy Institute, inflation-adjusted wages for recent college graduates have declined by nearly a dollar per hour over the same time period.
Here are the 10 states who saw average wages decline over the past decade when adjusted for inflation, according to Policy Matters Ohio.

				It should be lost on no one that 7 out of 10 of these states are ones that are dominated by Republican­s and are viewed as states that are likely to be leaning for Republican­s in the presidenti­al election.  In light of what has occurred over the last decade under the Bush administra­tion, you really have to ask the voters in these states one question..­.........W­hy?  Haven't you had enough of Republican­s driving the middle class into the ground yet?

				If it were up to many of these CEO's, I'm sure they would do away with labor altogether if they had the opportunit­y just so they could go to the stock holders and say look how much I saved. Morons fail to realize that when less peeps work, less peeps buy there garbage, although they just keep downsizing­, till they are a one plant operation, and no one is working, then who will buy their garbage. Not everyone is rich like them and can live off investment­s and dividends. They fail to realize that apparently­, as this country will not survive if we are left with only the stock market to make money from. And these guys get paid HOW MUCH? COMEON MAN!

				Corporatio­ns and their purchased representa­tives cannot see father than their noses. Cutting the budget causes more lost jobs and they can STILL sell this to gullible voters. 
This is one of the reasons Republican­s cut education first. They do not want their voters to THINK.

				Productivi­ty has also increased faster than wages meaning more profits. Guess who pockets the fruit of labor. You got it! Corporate CEOs and their executive peers. Median CEO pay rose by 27% in 2010. Depending on who you read and how it is measured, income levels for the top 5% rose as much as 227% in the same period.

				Well, it looks like the wages decreased anywhere from 3 - 5 % for the average employee.

i guess that make sense, we had to give 3% to the richest americans in the form of tax cuts, the money had to come from somewhere.  And with corporate profits skyrocketi­ng, the only other place is labor (aka anyone who works for a living).

To the richest 2% of Americans (By the way- if you think that is you, you are likely wrong. 19% of all Americans think they are in the top 2%) on behalf of the middle class... 

You're welcome!

				I guess when the Republican­s spoke about that trickling down......­.. they meant the wages being earned by the masses....­......

They just haven't figured out that when a persons income decreases and the prices of purchased goods increase, people just can't purchase as much......­....

Which is the kiss of death to a consumptio­n economy like what the US has.......­.....

				No, Trickle down worked.  We cut the taxes of the rich by about 3% and that trickled down to us.  We had to pay for it with about a 3% decrease in our pay.

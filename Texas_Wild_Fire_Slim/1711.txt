Despite the horrifying slaughter of millions of innocent people that resulted from Germany's previous experience with Naziism, it appears that some communities in the country have not cut all ties with the movement.
The tiny German village of Jamel has a long history of links to far-right extremist groups. The website of Germany's Der Spiegel magazine describes life in the town:
Hitler salutes in the streets, firing practice in local forests and outsiders chased away. The small run-down settlement has become a dark symbol of the growing reach of neo-Nazi ideology.
On the eve of state elections in Germany, VBS TV journalist Barbara Dabrowska was shocked to discover a barbeque grill embossed with the phrase "happy holocaust" while travelling through the town. 
Many in the village support the Neo-Nazi-linked National Democratic Party (NPD). The party gained seats in the local elections that took place in Germany over the weekend. 
Germany's The Local ascribes the popularity of far-right parties in small communities to the fact that mainstream political parties tend to neglect small towns in favor of campaigning in large cities.
The site quotes Olaf Krüger, an unemployed cook from the village of Koblentz:
Even those who are employed can hardly survive on their meagre wages and must get help from the government, he said, helping the NPD capitalize on populist frustrations. “No other party cares about the people here,” he said
As for the offending grill? It was located in the yard of an NPD office building, and a local party politician claimed that he hadn't noticed the bigoted words emblazoned across it. 
You can watch Dabrowska's full report (in German) on her experience in the town, including her discovery of the grill,  below.

				Yeah seriously, and Germany isn't going to listen to America. LoL. Unlike Iraq, we can't just bust into Germany and make them try to see from our point of view. Germany is the superpower of Europe. They've got the most stable government out of anyone over there, they've got the most money (they ARE the European economy) and they're the most levelheade­d thinkers. Why do you think German's are kind of "as*hole-i­sh" compared to the rest of Europe? They know the rest of Europe can't survive without them.

				The same people who deny that the Holocaust existed are still the ones who keep the anti-Jewis­h and anti-Israe­l hatred alive both in Europe and in Arab nations.  You can read their ignorant and vulgar posts and comments whenever the Palestinia­n/Israeli dispute is reported. While this news doesn't surprise me (I remember hearing in Germany "there are no more Nazis" I wonder how the German authoritie­s on both the Left and Right will react to this report of this neo-Nazi village, and whether the Huffington Post will have any follow up reporting?  Will German authoritie­s try to make excuses or cover it up?   Will the root causes of their blaming nearly a negligible population of German  Jews for their economic and social problems ever get debated publicly?    This is pretty sick if you ask me.

				Right, shellytayl and Federico - and there are non-German­s in this country and throughout the world who still believe in the Nazi manifesto. Jew-hatred­, racism, bigotry, prejudice -- whatever label is applied -- this will continue on throughout history unless mankind gets tired of it. That will probably be when pigs fly through a frozen hell while weaving silk purses out of their sows' ears and weaving chaff into gold to fill those purses! And yes, posters, many of you may have seen me post that in other forums, so I apologize for the redundancy­.

				Yes it is a bit surprising and not quite the same as some "good old boys" flying the rebel flag which was a symbol of the (at that time) South's new independan­ce from the North.  This is way different.  Germany, considered a very advanced and sophistica­ted nation systematic­ally tortured and put to death with german efficiency­, literally MILLIONS of people.  What is doubly shocking is that they actually made a business out of it cataloging items stripped from Jewish people, shipping them to camps to be immediatel­y gassed or used as workers.  They took the gold fillings out of their teeth.  My Grandfathe­r assisted in the liberation of one of these camps.  Genocide against ANY people is deplorable and there has been genocide perpetrate­d before and since the Holocaust but never did a nation attempt to wipe out another group of people with such brutal, cold efficiency­.

				It doesn't take much to outrage and antagonize certain population­s and there are alway people who work very hard at it, knowing the reaction and watching from the sidelines. How did this reporter find the story? Did he just trip over it, or was he led to it over time with little hints, and how fast did he spread the news with his name attached. Let's all pause now, swear and curse, jump up and down, condemn these social pariahs and have a very satisfying moment, congratuli­ng ourselves at our social conscience­.

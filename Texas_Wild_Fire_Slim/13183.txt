Why is it,﻿ no matter how good the idea, no matter how much it saves money, how it helps the average American, the GOP is against it?? This should tell you that all republicans want to do is make President Obama look like a failure!!!! I found this page after reading about it on a anti-Obama news site, which was condemning the patent reform idea! This what repubs do, is tear down the Democratic Party, in the effort to make themselves look good!!!! Name one good idea coming out of the GOP!?!?

Socializing industries and putting private sector companies out of business has nothing to do with﻿ the patent office.
Stop grouping them together.

Nobody thinks patent reform isn't a good idea. But in the face of a catastrophic economy, a tsunamic of national debt, and a horrendous unemployment rate-- when the president proposes patent reform as the key to economic recovery IT'S JUST PREPOSTEROUS! Is this the best that the Obama administration can do to get the country back to work?

I don't think the Obama administration has listened to *any* start-up. If they did, they would've known most of them are AGAINST software patents,﻿ and they think patents should be abolished.
And they should take a look at When Patents Attack from This American Life.

This should not be a democratic or republican issue. This is big business (for the reform) against small business﻿ (against the reform). If the government wants to fix the problem they would stop stealing funds (fee diversion) from the patent office - which is essentially a tax on innovation. But the current legislation does nothing to stop that. Big business does not need patents. They can sue people just because. Only small business needs patents.

The Patent Reform Bill will only exacerbate the pendency problem. Changing our system to first to file rather than first to invent and ending the best mode disclosure requirement will only﻿ cause more less well prepared applications to be filed. I bet Goolsbee's mother never made a crustless PBJ sandwich that would infringe the patent he refers to--it has many limitations--and is really clever.

@groundhog2008 you're exactly, go to any FUCKING ARTICLE on the gop and all it says is, " Democrats are bad, democrats are bad, and democrats are bad". No actual reason to become a republican on there.

Great! We have been awaiting improvements on this﻿ outdated & slow turn-around system. Thank You for reducing timeline & bringing the Dept. to a functioning system-12 months would be great again.

@groundhog2008 Because we are left to pick the lesser of two evils. I pick the GOP sorry but you cant believe anything out of this white house. Remember Obama's shovel ready﻿ jobs oh wait Obama said there is no such thing. Hey where's all the money he spent on no such thing.

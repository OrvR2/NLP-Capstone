TORONTO,  Feb. 18 (UPI) -- Doctors at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto used an external artificial lung to keep a patient alive until donor lungs were available. 
Last summer, 15-year-old Katie Sutherland was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension. This rare condition constricts veins and arteries within the lungs and forces the heart to work much harder than normal to pump blood to the lungs. As a result, Sutherland's heart was failing. Before the operation her heart had swelled up to four times its regular size and was no longer pumping enough blood.   
Dr. Shaf Keshavjee, the surgical team leader, used the German-made Novalung device to partially bypass Sutherland's failing lungs allowing her heart to do less work.
Unlike older artificial lungs which were run by mechanical pumps, Novalung is powered by the patient's own heartbeat. It is a membrane ventilator that allows oxygen and carbon dioxide to exchange through simple diffusion, Keshavjee said. 
With the artificial lung, the teen remained stable for a month until suitable donor lungs became available. During that time she was able to breathe, talk and eat, and do gentle exercises.
Today Sutherland is getting back her routine -- returning to school and playing soccer, Keshavjee said.

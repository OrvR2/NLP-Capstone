well kates photo shop pic sure looked pretty legit to me. she looked good. i bet it wasnt a big difference in the first place. photos are always altered/enhanced.. they r just pointing out alterations with messages like thin is in, women arent equal or something like that (government photo), darker skin = bad, etc.. thats why its very bad to be a media sheep cuz subliminal messages are everywhere. to get you to buy that, make you feel like this, and to get you to belive them.but how can you not be. you only know what your told (for the most part), lol. its hard to jumpout of the mix and realize whats going on.

if you think photoshop invented fake photos you are an idiot. It was just done in an actual dark room and took much longer but people did it all the time.

Bill Gates is right, all we need to do now is establish testing mechanisms that allow for individuals to demonstrate their knowledge without attaching the enormous debt that comes from a "traditional" university education that is why I like "High Speed University" research online.

Martha Stewart should still be in prison for all the people's lives she ruined with failed retirement policies.  Hopefully, she returns there someday for the rest of her life, getting @r$$ed raped by her  fellow inmates with cucumbers and broomsticks on a daily basis.

Let’s hear it for New YorkBy Mike KrumboltzMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz | The Upshot – 17 hrs ago

"Never forgotten. Forever grateful." To help honor the victims and heroes of Sept. 11, director Spike Lee filmed a unique and moving tribute to the New York Fire Department.
Lee, working with State Farm, filmed roughly 150 children from New York serenading members of the FDNY to the tune of Jay-Z and Alicia Keys's smash hit "Empire State of Mind." 

The tribute may remind some of  Staten Island's PS 22 choir's version of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" at the most recent Academy Awards.
This version of "Empire State of Mind" was conducted by James Davis Jr. The spot first appeared online several days ago.  It then aired during Sunday's Eagles-Rams NFL game. Now it is quickly going viral. Web searches for "empire state of mind lyrics" and "empire state of mind song" are starting to soar.
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of,
There's nothing you can't do,
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new,
The lights will inspire you,
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New York.
Proceeds for the song, which you can buy on iTunes, go toward the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation.

These wonderful children are our future.  We have to do our very best to make sure they have a good one.  I am very moved and proud to be an American.  Listen all you countries where your people are ruled and dictated to by repressive governments:  you won't provide a better future to your children than you have to their parents.  You won't have your children singing your praises.  Let all sing now:  New York.......

trapped in a whilpool. each year we are going to fall back into the mentality of memoralizing the dead. it's okay........but this should also bring forth a change. why did this happen and what can be done to stop it from happening again?...amerika as a country suffered a devastating blow to its security and its moral. new yorkers suffered at at higher and more persoanl level. ...it's time to let the dead bury the dead and find a true solution.....who brought this evil upon the amerikan people?   uncle sam did! the united states government did.  amerikans have the power to end the insanity....leaving the solution up to violence is more insanity....the military is the tool of the fascist who have hijacked this country.....cleary after ten years of war we have seen the solution they chose is not working. what is it going to take for the amerikan people to stand up and take amerika back from the dope dealing murdering corporate puppets from the county supervisors all the way to the president(s)...a democratic republic?....i don't think so.   hell, george bush invaded panama all by himself just like adolf hitler.....through democracy the military must be contained to defense and the government must be controlled and regualted....both, the government and the military serve the corporate conglomerates and not the best interests of the citizens of amerka.

I Love my country & I sincerely care about every Human on this planet.
That's why I want to encourage everybody to research all the 9/11 first responders who now believe 9/11 was an inside job.
The government admittedly knew the dust-filled air was not safe to breathe, but they lied & said it was okay. This, & the lack of gov. support or even acknowledgement of the SICK, DYING first responders, is what has woken so many of them up to the tragic Truth...
- -
I know it's not easy, but if we are to have a decent future, we must face the conspiracy FACTS- not "theories"- behind the plight of the Human condition...
- -
When asked why 9/11 isn‘t listed under Osama’s crimes on the Most Wanted List, FBI Chief Rex Tomb admitted there’s “no hard evidence linking bin Laden to 9/11.” This is one among many hundreds of FACTS that need to be examined by the American People...
I challenge anybody who still beLIEves the government's official conspiracy THEORY about bin Laden & al-Qaeda (al-CIAduh) to watch these documentaries & prove ONE THING wrong in them:
~”9/11: The Myth & the Reality” (an answer to Popular Mechanics “debunking” of 9/11 conspiracy "theories"- essentially debunking their alleged "debunking")
~"Terrorstorm" (history of government-sponsored terrorism- what’s TAUGHT AS “false flag” ATTACKS IN ARMY MANUALS; & more)
~"9/11 Press for Truth" (9/11 victim's family members questioning the official story- they were suspiciously ignored & mistreated by gov; THIS FILM NEUTRALIZES PROPAGANDA CLAIMING THAT 9/11 TRUTHERS ONLY HURT THE VICTIM’S FAMILIES- how can it hurt to HELP solve their Loved one’s murder?!)
~"911 Mysteries"
~"Fabled Enemies"
~"Loose Change: Final Cut" 
~”The 9/11 Chronicles: Part One, Truth Rising” (documents the exponentially growing movement to expose the Truth about that tragic, fateful day)

! * ! * ! * VOTE RON PAUL 2012 * ! * ! * !
[You can judge a tree by the fruit it bears, so PLEASE research Dr. Paul's long political record. He has ALWAYS acted & voted in the best interests of the People, & not in the interests of the corrupt, elitist banksters who have hijacked most of our government. This is why the elitist bankster-controlled media ignores, slanders & undermines Ron Paul so much!
Don't be misled by his Republican status- he's the exact OPPOSITE of neo-con Republicans like the Bushes. He's more of a Libertarian Independent- he even used to run Independent- but the system has it rigged to where it's virtually impossible for 3rd party candidates to win, so…]

My best friend ,she just has announced her wedding with a millionaire man! They met via SearchⱤichṢingles.CȯṀ ..it is the largest and best club for millionaires and their admirers to chat online. …You do not have to be rich or famous, but you may meet one. It's worth a try!

Joyce is a very pretty lady, let 's see how many women look like her in there 60's... I thought so.

most comments are from 15 yr. old kids with no sense of respect for women, hope you treat you mama's better and no one talks about them that way.

God Bless these brave men who ran into the burning buildings to save their fellow humans. They were there and heard the explosions in the buildings that actually brought them down in a controlled demolition and saw the moulten steel running like a fountain off the side of the building not from a office fire but from thermite. People should be ashamed of the government, they covered up a crime that took lives of these heros. 9/11 WAS an INSIDE JOB and to ignore the facts is an insult the lives of these selfless individuals.

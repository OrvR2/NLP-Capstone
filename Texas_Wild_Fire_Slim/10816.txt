Baylor lawyers up
By Michael W. Shapiro
Texas A&M's bid to join the SEC has been stalled by the possibility of legal action over their move, with Baylor University the first school from the Big 12 Conference to publicly refuse to waive its right to sue.
While it remains to be seen whether Baylor will actually take legal action, the university is exploring its options and hired outside counsel recently.
On Monday high-powered Beaumont lawyer Walter Umphrey told the Tribune-Herald that his firm, Provost Umphrey, is "part of a team" working for Baylor on the conference issues.
He didn't identify the other lawyers or firms involved and he declined to discuss legal strategy.
"We haven’t been notified by authorities at the university — either the board of regents or the president — on what’s going to be done," Umphrey said.
Though rumor abounds.
Since Baylor and several other Big 12 schools announced they weren't waiving their right to sue last week there's been rampant speculation about what entity Baylor and the other schools might sue (the SEC, A&M, Fox Sports?) and the chances of success of various legal avenues they could pursue.
Umphrey, a Baylor alum, was quoted in a Sunday column in his hometown newspaper as saying he would take on the Baylor case at no charge. He also expressed concern that his alma mater could end up in a second-tier athletic conference if the Big 12 breaks up and said the loss in TV revenue could be devastating.
Baylor Law School’s new building is named for Umphrey and his wife Sheila. Umphrey was part of the so-called Texas Dream Team, five lawyers who won more than $17 billion in a class action suit in Texas against tobacco companies.

In My Opinion ...




Should Baylor sue if A&M leaves the Big 12?

US Chamber spells out its own job agendaBy JIM KUHNHENN - Associated Press | AP – Mon, Sep 5, 2011





WASHINGTON (AP) — Putting a business imprint on the debate over jobs, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Monday issued an open letter to Congress and to the White House calling for a series of measures designed to increase employment, including greater oil drilling, quicker road and bridge construction and temporary corporate tax breaks.If enacted, the chamber estimates the steps could encourage corporations to spend much of the nearly $2 trillion dollars that have accumulated on their balance sheets and generate more than 6 million jobs by 2013, and even more in ensuing years.The chamber is looking to influence job creation proposals just days after a bleak government employment report showed no net job growth in August and four days before President Barack Obama delivers an economic speech to a joint session of Congress. Chamber proposals on trade and infrastructure are sure to overlap with some Obama administration initiatives. Others, such as the corporate tax breaks and oil drilling, are more certain to win Republican support.Chamber President Thomas Donohue released the seven-page letter as the first step in a campaign to draw attention to the chamber's proposals and influence Washington policymakers. The effort includes newspaper and Internet ads and outreach to chamber members nationwide.The campaign will encourage business leaders across the country to contact members of Congress and the White House to prod them into passing job creation legislation. Chances that the president and congressional Republicans can reach any kind of deal appear to be a longshot amid a partisan environment and testy relations."We're having a bunch of problems right now, but when we get done fooling around and decide what we're going to do, we're going to do it, and this is a good start," Donohue said in an interview. "We're interested to listen to other ideas that meet the same criteria: Quick, fast, workable, and not costing new money."While Obama's plan will include infrastructure spending, including possibly billions for school construction, it also is expected to propose renewing a payroll tax cut, extending jobless benefits and providing payroll tax credits to businesses that expand their hiring.Donohue identified six job creating initiatives:— Offering reduced tax rates to corporations on profits earned overseas, a move that the chamber says would encourage multinational corporations to bring as much as $1.2 trillion to the U.S. economy, and by temporarily reducing the tax rate companies pay on the sale of capital assets. White House officials have debated the merits of lower rates for foreign profits, but some argue that similar efforts in the past have resulted in higher dividends to stock holders rather than direct job creation. Some congressional Democrats have proposed offering such a tax break only to companies that expand their payrolls.— Passing pending trade agreements with Colombia, South Korea and Panama, modernizing export control measures and adopting changes in patent law to protect intellectual property.— Increase oil and gas exploration to levels in place before the Gulf oil spill prompted a moratorium on offshore drilling permits, expand oil and gas exploration on federal lands and approve a $7 billion, 1,700-mile oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast. The pipeline proposal has prompted daily protests at the White House which had resulted in high-profile arrests, including that of actress Daryl Hannah.— Congressional approval of transportation, aviation and water resources programs that finance road, bridge and airport construction. Those programs are mostly paid for with gasoline taxes or other user fees. Obama has repeatedly called on Congress to approve the measures, reiterating his appeal as recently as Saturday in his weekly radio and Internet address.— Facilitate tourism by promoting American travel, streamlining visa applications and speeding up security screenings for low-risk travelers.— Provide regulatory relief for industries, including a moratorium on rules that are deemed to have a significant economic impact until the economy has improved and employment has grown.Obama pleased business interests, and angered environmentalists, on Friday by withdrawing a proposed regulation that would tighten smog standards. The proposed rule was estimated to cost the economy anywhere between $19 billion and $90 billion a year and had prompted an outcry from Republicans and industry leaders."Moving ahead on this ozone deal was an A-1 move," Donohue said.

ah yes, the american chamber of commerce.  lobbys to send jobs and factories overseas, spends millions of lobbying dollars for conglomo to go tax free.  is responsible for the destruction of this nation by acting in collusion with foreign governments in direct opposition for the good of the nation.  never saw a trade agreement they could not say no to, regardless of who it was or where.  there are people in prison more honest than these people.  join us at watchmenofamerica.com

Business is the only path to rightousness. If you are not a Business Owner, you are just a worthless low-class worker. Business Owners Need less taxes, less regulation and more subsidies to increase their profits, which show the world how well God rewards their RIGHTeousness.

Obama is not really interested in creating jobs.  He's just talking out the side of his neck.  He has done everything possible to kill the U.S. petroleum industry and to send all industrial and manufacturing jobs out of the country.

It’s the Economy, Stupid5  Nuclear Jobs
We are making Plug-In Hybrids that will charge themselves on Dirty Coal and pollute almost as much as if they had driven on pure Gasoline.  Until Algae Research makes Clean Coal a reality all EV’s and Plug-In Hybrids are useless.  For more Jobs, we need to immediately move in the direction of More Nuclear Plants and Reprocessing of Nuclear Fuel Rods like the more “Advanced countries” in the World, the France and Britain.  Then after we learn how to clean up the Coal with Algae Research, we can go back to Coal.

It’s the Economy, Stupid4  Follow the Brazil Model
We need jobs and cleaner air and we cannot afford to wait 10 years for Cellulosic and Algae.  Cut their funding in half and use it to incentivize Sugar-based Advanced Ethanols Domestically by next year.  Incentivize the half of the Sugarcane crop for ADVANCED Ethanol.  Incentivize the growing of Sweet Sorghum in the SW Desserts and Sugar Beets up North for ADVANCED Ethanol with 65-85% CO2 Reduction.  There is no need to wait for Cellulosic and Algae; we can have advanced Ethanol this year by trading Corn for Ethanol.  Instead of making Ethanol with Corn with only 15% CO2 Reduction Rate, sell the Corn to South America for Sugarcane Ethanol.  Instead of driving up the price of Food, We make a few Friends South of the Border and get cleaner Air this year.  Also we might consider repealing the stupid Tariff on Clean, Green, Advanced Sugarcane Ethanol and put it on Dirty Imported Oil instead.

It’s the Economy, Stupid3  Follow the Brazil Model
We need jobs Mr. President and you control 2 out of 3 Big Auto Companies and the third. Ford, is one of your biggest Green Ass Kissers.  Have them make all new vehicles E85 Flex Fuel Vehicles.  Then have the Big 3 come up with E25 FFV Conversion kits for Older Vehicles that can be modified.  That would put us in position to flip the switch (and add Advanced Sugarcane Ethanol) when the price of Oil spikes in the Middle East because of some fake crisis.

It’s the Economy, Stupid2
ObamaNazi and the Dems have shut down the Gulf with the Moratorium and now the new Nazi Regulations that only the biggest Oil companies can afford to comply with.  If they are serious about more jobs and bringing down the price of Gasoline before the next Election, they might ask the Dutch how to build a good Oil Skimmer.  Then they could have the Navy build a fleet of them. (More Jobs)  And they could deploy them to the Gulf to be on Standby in case of another Blowout.  This would allow the Idiots at the Dept of Interior to back off his Job Killing Regulations and bring back the Oil and Gas Industry in the Gulf States.  Maybe this would even bring the Nation out of the Obama Recession.

Hey OBummer, Why don’t you ask the Dutch to borrow their 4 Skimmers? (the most advanced Oil Skimmers in the World)  We could deploy them to the Gulf to be on standby in case of another Blowout.  Then we could junk your Job Killing Oil and Gas Regulations and get the Oil and Gas Industry going again.

How dare the Chamber attempt to create jobs for Americans? This is Obama's show! That means oil drilling--in Brazil. That means a brand new Honda plant--in Mexico City. That means Obama bed bunny Immelt moves a GE segment to China. And finally, it means Gibson Guitar, that criminal cabal that has the audacity to employ Americans, must out source its work to Madagascar.

Until the Chamber of Commerce understands that this is Obama's show and Americans can go to hell, they're just not reading the correct tea leaves.

Most of the ideas sound reasonable enough. I agree with congressional Democrats though, tax breaks only for companies that expand payrolls.

13% of GDP is from manufacturing. Thats all that is left in this country. So it should not be hard for the chamber to get rid of the last bit of mfg. A tax break for the very people who's greed distroyed the county! They will not create one job in the USA. They are making more money then ever by sending American jobs overseas. And now they want to bring back those piles of cash tax free. The chamber of commerce is not the friend of the working people. They could care less if every poor person, working person and retired person dropped dead. Get off the internet, get off your back , take to the streets and do something!

This so called US Chamber of Commerce had nothing to do with the government, they are just an organization of the multinational thieves that have destroyed the American economy so they could reap unheard of profits. They are traitors and should be in prisons with Bernie Madoff.

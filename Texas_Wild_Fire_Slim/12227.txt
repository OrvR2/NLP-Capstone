Aug. 15, 2011 – MIDLAND, Texas – In recognition of their heroism, sacrifice and ongoing service to the people of West Texas, volunteer firefighters from 12 Permian Basin communities were honored by Chevron in an event at the Midland Horseshoe on Saturday. The firefighters and their families were treated to hot dogs and hamburgers grilled and served by Chevron volunteers while children played games, had their faces painted and met Smokey Bear. The festivities culminated with the presentation of a $500,000 check from Chevron to Texas Forest Service to bolster a fund that enables volunteer fire departments to stay in business.“Volunteer firefighters are our first line of defense against wildfire in Texas – and they’ve run the tires off their trucks this year – literally,” said Texas Forest Service Director Tom Boggus. “It’s an extremely generous gesture for Chevron to make this donation and recognize all the hard work these men and women do day in and day out – as volunteers – to protect lives and property in the state of Texas.”The honorees hailed from Levelland, Big Spring, Seminole, Andrews, Monahans, Kermit, Fort Stockton, Pecos, Sterling City, Garden City, Ozona and Big Lake. In addition to the $500,000 donation, fire departments won door prizes that included high-tech equipment like a thermal imaging camera and a blitzfire monitor that helps regulate and control the flow of fire hoses. Firefighters and their families won gifts such as a Kobalt tool set, a digital camera and a flat-screen television. “Several of our Permian Basin employees are volunteer firefighters and personify Chevron’s ideal of community involvement,” said Gary Luquette, president of Chevron North America Exploration and Production Company. “Chevron greatly appreciates the work of volunteer firefighters, who provide an important contribution to our communities.”Luquette added that Chevron’s contribution to Texas Forest Service’s VFD fund was in addition to $200,000 donated earlier this year to volunteer fire departments in Texas and New Mexico.

A Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) luncheon on Tuesday was disrupted by demonstrators, including several who were arrested while protesting the Wisconsin congressman.
Both pro- and anti-Paul Ryan demonstrators gathered outside the Greenfield, Wis. banquet hall Ryan was visiting for a luncheon with the Whitnall Park Rotary Club, according to Patch reporters Denise Konkol and David Cotey.
Ryan attempted to make light of the situation at the start of the event, saying "apparently you Rotarians don't like free lunches either. ... Welcome to a 'new normal' in Wisconsin."
Several protestors who paid to attend the lunch attempted to drown out Ryan by standing and shouting questions during his remarks. One woman asked, "When are you going to create jobs, Congressman?" while another man criticized Ryan for avoiding the topic of unemployment, saying "We're three minutes in and we haven't heard the word 'jobs' yet."
According to Patch, about a dozen protesters were escorted out of the building, and another dozen left the speech willingly. Three were arrested and given municipal citations.
Police told Patch they warned protesters in advance that they could face arrest if they disrupted Ryan's speech.

                        it is disturbing to see how many conservati­ve congress people disrespect their constituen­ts, are not interested in what they have to say and actually drag these people from the town hall meetings. They clearly do not see themselves as public SERVANTS, but rather some sort of independen­t decision makers. The only thing I take from all of this is if we were to have a GOP                        
                                                     Read More...
 president and a majority gop congress, we will be one step closer to living in a police state. If and when that happens, we will have no one but ourselves to blame considerin­g the lack of participat­ion in the political process.

				Its sad to see people who are older and most likely veterans who fought for their country being taken out because they are trying to use their first amendment right.  Its not fair that people cannot even enjoy their twilight years because of the economic mess which was created by their representa­tives.  It takes a big man to have an older man be removed because of his desperatio­n in trying to be heard.  What happened to respecting your elders?  Isn't it the job of our government representa­tives to hear greivances from people in their district?  Removing people and silencing them will only help in creating anger instead of adressing their needs.  Its not like its a small majority anymore; poll numbers show that people have lost all confidence in Congress.  What will it take for these elected officials to stop talking and start doing?

				Did you complain when  the Pea Party folk were shouting down Democrats at town halls meetings? I bet not. At  least Dems maned up and faced their constituen­ts, did not cancel events, charge attendance­, and demand to know what questions were going to be asked ahead of time.

				I forgot to mention that poor Paul lost his dad at an early age and then collected Social security survivor benefits which admirably he used to pay for college. The man pulled himself up by the boot straps, since his families business interest did not enable his family to pay for his school.
Check out Ryan Incorporat­ed Central they are just barely making it.

				I have to laugh because some people always blame unions. I wonder how many of these people worked at union jobs and took all the benefits from them including the pensions and health care they enjoy now. Also how many of these people using the GOP saying make it your own have actually made it own their own. Meaning making your own money, buying your own house etc not living off of a silver spoon, social security or medicare or disability­.

				The House is under republican control, so they won't vote in favor of anything the Dems want; the Senate is 59-41 and the Repubs hold the Dems to a fictional "supermajo­rity" of 60 votes to pass anything. Republican­s in the Senate filbuster anything the Dems propose. So for all intents and purposes, there is republican control.

Not only this ego maniac but lots of them "Off for a few weeks for labor day and to hear from constituen­ts, kinda sorta heard from many and ended all town halls and other areas where their great unwashed masses might embarrass them with reality. yep the "represent­" the people" and we all know which ones they work for, more so now that Sup Ct and Romney said "corps are people.

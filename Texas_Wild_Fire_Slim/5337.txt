Title had nothing to do with the video...........jornalism at its finest, show idiots of world idiot things..........................they will follow no matter what.  .............* months to travel to mars? how fast did the other 2 rovers get there? There have beeen som seriously compeling images that were.."released by NASA" but where are the other images we dont see? .....Its like the uppercrust of government and agencies working for them dont want the public eyes to be in space that much. So mayber there is life in space and on mars....but we will never see the "released photos" of them. Why does NASA smudge out things in the pictures of mooon and other planets?? Gary Mckenon saw them when he hacked into NASA. So when we have these news titles saying there is something and all we get is fluff documentation of scheduled space travel of robotic cars sent there makes me wonder if the people of the wolrd should be shown what more is going on with space and planets near to us.

We are semi-intelligent life, there will be no Paleogical, Archaeoligical! We will teraform it if its possible and dig up all the abundent metals like gold then build out the whole planet put our skeletons in the ground! Just so one day we can blame all the evils of our new planetary government on a House-ing bubble with double and triple dip recession! Ta Da Mankind! 

The End!

HOUSTON (KTRK) -- 
A deputy opened fire overnight on two men  caught robbing a fast food restaurant.	
Related ContentMore: Got a story idea?  Let us know!   It happened at the Sonic on West Little York near the Eastex Freeway in northeast Harris County.  Deputies say this was all the result of two suspects refusing to comply with deputies who they say told them to stop multiple times.  Harris County sheriff's deputies say two men were in the process of robbing this Sonic restaurant just 20 minutes before midnight as the store was getting ready to close.  A 911 caller described two men in baseball caps wearing bandanas.  When deputies arrived, they say they found the two men who took off running.    One of them reportedly carrying a shotgun turned toward officers with that weapon and was shot in the leg by a deputy.  The other man continued running and was stopped by a K-9 unit.  He sustained a dog bite to the shoulder.  The suspected robber shot in the leg was taken to Ben Taub Hospital and is expected to be OK.  The men's names have not been released, nor have the charges against them.

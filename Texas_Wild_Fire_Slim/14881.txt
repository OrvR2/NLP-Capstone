HOUSTON – Residents were allowed to return to their homes Sunday evening after a grass fire prompted evacuations at an apartment complex near Bush Intercontinental Airport.
Houston firefighters responded to a fire in a wooded area off FM1960 at Birnham Woods shortly before 5 p.m.
Due to the wind direction, firefighters were forced to evacuate the Mansions at Turkey Creek apartments, located in the 2900 block of Birnaham Road, as a precaution.
HFD got the fire under control by midnight and allowed residents to return home, but continued to monitor the area for hot spots throughout the night.
The cause of the fire is under investigation.

I have positioned good quality hoses at the front and rear of my house and am ready to put out any grass fire that may approach.The rest of you can run away like the government says and hope the firefighters are not too busy put water on your lawn and save your house.

An 18-wheeler truck lost it's trailer, the brakes hit the pavement and sparked the fire. It's on the other media web sites.

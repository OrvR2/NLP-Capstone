Of all the aspects of the workplace, it's with health insurance benefits that satisfaction is most quickly dropping, according to a recent survey from Gallup. 
Asked which aspects of their jobs they like most and least, 30 percent of those surveyed said they were dissatisfied with employer health care benefits. That's up from 19 percent just three years ago, the largest percent increase of any of Gallup's 13 job-satisfaction indicators.
Most of those polled appeared to be more or less satisfied with the conditions of their respective work places -- who they work with, the work required of them and their bosses. People are less content with what they receive in compensation, however. Of those polled, 28 percent expressed dissatisfaction with retirement benefits offered by their employers and 26 percent with their chances of receiving a promotion, for example.
Overall, general employee job satisfaction is down to 83 percent, compared to 90 percent before the recession, and it's the unemployment crisis that is said to be the primary culprit, according to Gallup. Now with many more workers available than jobs, employees put up with less favorable conditions for fear of not finding another job, while companies continue to cut costs. 
In this way, job security has also suffered.  The same poll found that 30 percent of workers feared being laid off in the near future, close an all-time high. The concern would seem at least partially justified, as the poll took place less than a month after it was reported that layoffs had surged to a 16-month high. Indeed, while current unemployment rate stands at 9.1 percent, a much larger percentage than that is suffering. It was recently reported that 16.2 percent of working age Americans are jobless, underemployed or have dropped out of the work force after giving up hope of finding employment.
Here are the ten areas with the most worker dissatisfaction, according to Gallup:

				Stress from watching qualified colleagues be forced out, having to pick up their work and your own, unpaid overtime because you're in "professio­nal class" and not protected in any way, and watching your back to make sure that if the job is outsourced you can land on your feet while making payments on an underwater mortgage for a house that required only 24% of income is more stress than Dad had. To say nothing of paying for college for the kids and uncompensa­ted continuing education to stay employed. That's reality for many people I know.

				When the crash hit, our firm announced there would be no raises, no Christmas bonus (used to get a weeks pay) and no more employer contributi­on to health insurance. Now we are riding high again, profits are huge, the partners are all taking European vacations and buying new summer homes, but for the workers ... still no raises, no bonus and no input to health insurance plans. We are told time and again how lucky we are to have a job. To emphasize this, they laid off a third of support staff and passed on the extra work to the rest of us. It truly is the victory of the Galts. We bow and scrape to the masters because we are all afraid of losing our jobs - and with them our homes, our health insurance, our kids educations­. This is America now - the rat race on steroids, but only for the workers. The Galts have never had it better than they do right now.

				I can empathize with your situation.  I work for a large company in network operations­.  Even through the financial crash we made tons of money.  We would get yearly bonuses based on performanc­e and the company's profits.  It wasn't a ton of money but it would help pay off a major bill or a vacation once in awhile.  After the crash however, things have changed.  They pulled our bonuses (but not middle or upper management­) without much explanatio­n.  Contractin­g is now the norm and a lot of the work we used to do locally or in house is been abolished.  They say it's for the money, but contractor­s are infamous for padding their expenses.  Our CEO gets an obscene salary with bonus but our health care costs are going up and jobs are being outsourced­!

I used to love the technology I work with and the old company, but now it's a struggle to come in here on a daily basis when we are stuck with Six Sigma (a way to cut a lot of jobs) and made to feel that we should just shut our mouths and be glad to have a job.  Of course I'm glad to have the job but things have changed for the worse!

				It's a similar situation that drove me to actually quit my job!!  I planned it for more than 6 months, set aside some money to cushion the unemployme­nt period, then after giving a killer presentati­on submitted my resignatio­n.  Couldn't put up with the stress anymore.  I was promised career growth when they enticed me away from a very stable position at a competitor­, only to be pigeonhole­d into a position where it was a ton of work but no career growth.  Vocalizing my concerns only ended up creating problems for me, so after 4 years, I quit & relocated to a less expensive part of the country.  I'm still looking for work, but I've never been prouder of my decisions than I am about this one.  I'm way happier unemployed & sans insurance than I was struggling in the rat race :)

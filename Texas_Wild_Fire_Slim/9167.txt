What did Ali Lohan do to her face?By Erin CarlsonPostsEmailBy Erin Carlson | The Juice – Wed, 7 Sep, 2011 8:19 PM EDT

The first thing Ali Lohan did when she got signed to a modeling agency was obtain ... an entirely new face?
The  17-year-old sister of Lindsay and daughter of Dina stepped  out in Beverly Hills yesterday looking, in all honesty, like a  surgically altered version of her former self. Lohan's lips and cheeks  appear fuller and her nose narrowed and tweaked. Her eyebrows are  bushier and more defined, exuding that '80s Brooke Shields quality that's trendy this moment. She looks shockingly skinny, as if  attempting to mimic the lanky, size-00 frame of a high-fashion runway  model.
Vh1's The Fab Life notes: "We'd love to believe her almost-unrecognizable new face is due to some sculpting makeup, Lip Venom and masterful eyebrow threading, but we're skeptical."
Lohan inked a contract with NEXT Model Management  last month, and it appears she's taking her new career path very, very  seriously. Like, "I'm gonna go out and get a face transplant" seriously.
In the name of Heidi Montag, someone please tell Hollywood to handcuff Dina Lohan and outlaw underage plastic surgery while they're at it because another  naive, misguided Lohan girl has become catnip to the snarking  interwebs. Quips the Best Week Ever blog: "Maybe now that she's a model, Ali has decided to exchange being cute with, like, paying tribute to Michael Jackson by ... becoming him?"
That's plenty of reason to be.

She looks anorexic and evil. She was very pretty before the surgery. Why would she make herself look "OLD"??

this is stupid..other than her hair she really doesnt look very different.  I dont see why she'd get a modeling contract either way though, she's not very pretty and rather generc looking...

how could you look at yourself in the mirror after a change like that? I hardly recognize myself after I dye my hair! why would someone do that to themselves??? She looks far worse than she did.

Young girl goes to model agency wanting to be a model. Obviously, Mom goes with her 'cause she is underaged!!  Model agency says, "You're cute but.....this is what we are looking for.  We ll pay you xxx amount of dollars (cause you are LL's sister and we can make a lot of money of you!!) to have your face surgically altered"!  Mother of the year steps up and says, "Yes, anything for my daugher"!  
  The more I thought about this the more repulsive it became. Someone should hold the mother accountable and the model agency?

She went from VERY pretty, to pretty scary. 
And I'm open to surgical improvements. 
So sad...to see another pretty girl ruining her natural beauty. Remember Heidi Montague...folks.

Teenagers critical after train accident


Tweet


















  
Eagle Staff Report
Two teenage boys who were struck by a train near Gause remained hospitalized in critical condition Tuesday.
Chief Deputy Chris White of the Milam County Sheriff's Office said the teenagers, 16 and 17, are believed to have been sleeping on railroad tracks when they woke up to a train coming and were unable to get away. 
From what he could tell while on scene, it appeared the teens suffered multiple lacerations and fractures, he said, adding that it appeared their injuries weren't life-threatening.
White said deputies received a call over the weekend indicating the boys had run away from Resolution Ranch, a facility for troubled teenage boys.

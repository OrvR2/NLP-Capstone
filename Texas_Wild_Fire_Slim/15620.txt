Ad 
hominem abuse: Beck makes no attempt to challenge substance of 
report
Beck launches a series of attacks against report's 
authors, completely ignores substance of their findings. On 
his October 21 Fox News show, Beck said of a report -- reportedly commissioned 
by the NAACP -- 
"Now, would it shock you to hear that the NAACP 
found in their intensive investigation that there is racist, bigotry, nativism, 
and even white supremacy within the Tea Party?" He added, "Who saw that one 
coming?" At no point 
during the segment he devoted to attacking the report's authors did Beck 
challenge the accuracy of any of the information it presented.
Report documents Tea Party orgs' links to racism, 
nativism
Report: "[A]ll of the national Tea 
Party factions have had problems" with racism and nativism. 
The introduction 
to the report, written for the NAACP by Devin Burghart and Leonard Zeskind of the Institute for 
Research and Education on Human Rights, states, "It would be a mistake to claim 
that all Tea Partiers are nativist vigilantes or racists of one stripe or 
another, and this report manifestly does not make that claim. As this report 
highlights, all of the national Tea Party factions have had problems in these 
areas." In addition, the introduction stated, "Five of the six national [Tea 
Party] factions have" birthers "in their leadership." From the 
introduction:

The leading figures in one 
national faction, 1776 Tea Party (the faction more commonly known as 
TeaParty.org), were imported directly from the anti-immigrant vigilante 
organization, the Minuteman Project. Tea Party Nation has provided a gathering 
place for so-called birthers and has attracted Christian nationalists and 
nativists. Tea Party Express so outraged the public with the racist 
pronouncements of its leaders, that other national factions have (recently) 
eschewed any ties to it. Both ResistNet and Tea Party Patriots, the two largest 
networks, harbor long-time anti-immigrant nativists and racists; and Tea Party 
Patriots has opened its doors to those aiming at repeal of the Seventeenth 
Amendment and the direct election of United State 
Senators.

Report: 1776 Tea Party founder 
Robinson carried N-word sign, sent emails depicting Obama as a pimp, promoted 
anti-Semites on radio show. Burghart and Zeskind reported, 
"The 1776 Tea Party, also known as TeaParty.org, is the one national faction 
most directly connected to the Minutemen Project and the anti-immigrant 
movement." According to Burghart and Zeskind, "The organization's founding 
president is Dale Robertson." From Burghart and Zeskind's report: 

On February 27, 2009, Robertson attended a Tea Party 
event in Houston with a sign reading "Congress = Slaveowner, Taxpayer = Niggar." 
He's also sent out racist fundraising emails depicting President Obama as a 
pimp. Robertson also has a history of promoting anti-Semites on his 'Tea Party 
Hour' radio program. 
[See the chapter "Racism, 
Anti-Semitism and the Militia Impulse" for more.] Both incidents increased the 
negative publicity surrounding the 1776 Tea Party, but its notoriety did not 
stop two leaders of an anti-immigrant vigilante group, Minuteman Project, from 
stepping in to run the 1776 organization. 


Report: Leaders of anti-immigrant 
groups active in ResistNet; group itself partners with birthers and 
nativists. According to Burghart and Zeskind's report, 
"Many leaders of state and local anti-immigrant groups," such as local Minutemen 
chapters, "have become active with ResistNet," a Tea Party group. Burghart and Zeskind further reported 
that ResistNet has partnered with the We the People Foundation for 
Constitutional Education; the foundation, Burghart and Zeskind reported, ran a full-page 
ad in the Chicago 
Tribune questioning Obama's citizenship. Burghart and Zeskind also reported: 

Another ResistNet partner 
organization is TakeAmericaBack.org, a website launched in April 2009 to publish 
anti-immigrant propaganda. One article claimed that "multiculturalism" demands 
that "Americans learn to speak Spanish so illegals can take over America with 
foreign cultures." 
Another article on this site concluded that "a Kenyan, Communist, 
son of a terrorist, as our wannabe president, who has not only expressed his 
hatred of America, but 
is also an avowed 
Muslim..."

Tea Party Nation convention hosted 
birthers, anti-immigrant extremists. According to the report, 
a February Tea Party Nation convention in Nashville, Tennessee, "built bridges 
to nativists and so-called birthers," including at least two speakers pushing birther conspiracy 
theories. Burghart and Zeskind reported:

Joseph Farah, of the website WorldNetDaily, gave the 
convention's Friday evening keynote speech. Farah spent nearly half his time 
cooking up a Biblical basis for his obsession with Obama's birth certificate. 
Some of the convention leading figures did not like this kind of "birther" 
conspiracy talk, however. Andrew Breitbart, for example, privately criticized 
him for it. Nevertheless, the issue of whether or not President Barack Obama is 
a natural-born American continued to percolate in Nashville. For example, Miki 
Booth, an Hawaiian-born woman who's also a member of the Route 66 Tea Party, 
announced her candidacy for the Oklahoma 2nd District Congressional seat from 
the convention floor. Holding up a copy of Obama's birth certificate, she said 
"this piece of junk is what you get when you don't have one of these," she 
finished, holding up a copy of her birth certificate, to raucous applause. When 
Orly Taitz, the California resident who has pressed the birth certificate issue 
the most loudly, made an appearance at the convention, she was warmly welcomed 
and continually stopped for autographs.
Although the Federation for American Immigration Reform 
(FAIR) pulled out of the convention as discussed earlier, several of FAIR's 
allies still addressed the Tea Party Nation crowd. Phil Valentine, a Nashville 
radio talk-show host that has featured FAIR on his radio program numerous times, 
spoke at the convention. During a 2006 town hall meeting broadcast with FAIR 
staffer Susan Tully, Valentine advised Border Patrol Agents to "shoot" 
undocumented immigrants. 

Convention sponsored by Tea Party 
Patriots featured Geller; local group leader linked to KKK. 
Burghart and Zeskind reported that the 
Tea Party Patriots organization was a sponsor of the Tennessee Tea Party 
Coalition Convention, held in May in Gatlinburg. The report states: 
"Notable among the workshops were presentations by Pam Geller, an anti-Islam 
agitator. As Media Matters has 
documented, Geller regularly pushes 
hateful rhetoric about racial and religious minorities. Additionally, the report 
states: 

Wood County Tea Party is lead by Karen Pack, who 
describes herself as a "A Christian, a Tea Party Member, a Constitutionalist and 
a Patriot." Missing from that description, however, is Karen Pack's history with 
the Ku Klux Klan. Documents obtained by IREHR show that Karen Pack of Winnsboro, 
subscribed to the "White Patriot" tabloid, and that Thom Robb's Knights of the 
Ku Klux Klan listed her as an "official supporter."

                    Classy, that's why you guys lose...you underestimate the competion from your ivory tower...and by ivory tower i mean your grandmas basement. "I'll take the trash out in a minute gran gran!!!  I'm labeling an entire group of people as dumb for not refuting the facts by not refuting the facts and calling them dumb!!!Duh!!!" 

Info for ya...

The group that is responsible for writing the report is actually an important issue, not the entire issue, but it allows you to begin the thought process of mentally digesting this report within its glaring context.  You would do the same thing if a report came from...lets say The Heritage Foundation.  It is also important to put the NAACP in context...

More info for ya...

                    Thanks for the links to The Blaze and Big Government. I was only mocking the amazing consistency of the beck fans commenting here in showing that they're completely buying Beck's act, and his claims that anybody who sees through his act must be scared of him.

But you've added something very important; The fact that Beck fans consider the same irrational logic  Professor Glenda relies on "info" when it's written at even the most laughably unreliable blogs.

I appreciate you volunteering.

And I would question anything from The Heritage Foundation. Not simply because I disagree with them, but because they have such a horrible record . I wouldn't dismiss a specific item from The Heritage Foundation because of the details of their members' past, but because of the details of that item.

And I haven't had a grandma in about 45 years.

On the positive side ( for you) just remember that, even if I wasn't really underestimating you, it doesn't matter at the polls. Your vote counts just the same as a normal person's.

It's quite possible that our government could be filled up with Chritine O'Donnells and Sharon Angles, if enough teabaggers can find their way to the voting booth. Good luck.

                    Opening paragraph of this thread: Glenn Beck launched into a series of ad hominem attacks against the authors of a study that highlighted national Tea Party organizations' ties to racism and nativism. At no point did Beck refute -- or address in any way -- any of the actual findings in the report....yet you do the same thing to my "studies" that I cited because of the sites they came from. I guess you can call me stupid but at least I understand irony when I see it.


Here, this time I will just provide the youtube link so maybe you can hear him being racist since it not on website you abhore...which makes complete sense...really

Here ya go dude...

                    "Studies" ??? You think right wing blog opinion pieces qualify as "studies"?

I don't want to take up too much space with your off-topic confusion, but here's a bit from the first cuple of paragraphs of The Blaze piece;

...the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has given its endorsement to a report labeling the tea party as a self-preserving movement of racist bigots. It‘s no wonder given the fact that NAACP’s political agenda conflicts with the vast majority of the tea party platform of smaller government and reduced spending.

With Wednesday’s release of the report, however, the news media is once again dropping the ball, not only by not pointing out the NAACP’s obvious conflict of interest with the tea party movement... 

There's a very biased "summary" of the report, a pulled- outta -the- backdoor "fact" about the NAACP's agenda being in conflict with the Tea Parties ( way too subjective to use as a premise).

There's some confusion about the term "conflict of interest" ( which seems to be a real stumper for the right wing brain), it doesn't mean somebody can't do a report on somebody they disagree with.

That's what I'm talking about. The entire thing is a bunch of unattributed quotes, quasi-facts, paraphrasing and innuendo. It's designed to fool those with very limited critical thinking skills into thinkng they're reading a "study".

I'm not sure what your point is about the Youtube video. Maybe if you were a little more specific about what your point is, others could respond. Simply linking to ridiculous propaganda sites doesn't really show that you're interested in having a conversation.

                    Sorry, there was so much stupidity to address that I forgot about this;

.yet you do the same thing to my "studies" that I cited

No, I didn't get paid millions of dollars to do an hour long tv show about your links. I only mentioned that they were crap. Laughably bad equivalence.

                    Interesting that this article is about Beck's ad hominem attacks on teh authors of the report.  All he did was look into their history and call them what they professed to be (communists and seekers of social justice).  You certainly can't think that calling them what they call themselves is a bad thing, can you?  

You and Evil Conservative both do a discredit to your debate by name-calling and surmising who lives in granny's basement.  The last gasp of a weak arguement is usually to call the opponent names.  Look at public discourse lately and it is plain that the left is the desperate name caller (for now).  I don't care which side does it, if you can't argue your point without ad hominems then you lose all credibility.

not the entire issue,
Then why does Beck make it the entire issue? That's the point of the post. Beck doesn't say anything to indicate anything in the report is false, he just goes after the Scary Negroes that wrote it.

                    Too funny. It's the only thing Beck addresses, and the only thing addressed in Evil Conservative's links. Gotta give some credit for having the balls to use The Blaze and a Breitbart site as sources of "info", though.

Imagine, a group that is against racism writes something about the Tea party's well-documented racism. And it seems suspiciously like they wrote the piece with the intention of pointing out that racism.

I think this is where Nostradumbass would say, in a goofy voice; "hmmmm... very convenient. What a coincidence!"

God, he must have the stupidest audience on the planet.

                    The Blaze as a source of information? - ROFLMAO - I have spent some time at the Blaze which is a perfect example of how bigoted, racist and full of hate that Beck's Tea Party is.  I was shocked with the hatred on that site.  It truly was an eyeopener.  I guess they do not realize that others can go and read their articles and post and see for themselves how they really are - and they also don't seem to realize that what goes on the internet stays on the internet FOREVER!!

                    Wow that's a bit insulting to black people I'd say isn't it?

In fact, two white men wrote the report.
And two premier hate groups helped them.

                    A) provide a REPUTABLE link proving that
and 
B) are you talking about the Black Panthers, who are not only anti-racist but have been defunct for several years, or the "New Black Panthers", who have like five members? Or is this just "they all look alike" on a grand scale?

                    Do not argue with an hypocrite...
1. When there is a sign in a tea party rally that is racism but when Obama said that it was patriotism.
2. When VF paint Bush as joker (http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2008/07/bush-as-joker.html), that was fun but same thing with current president, that is racism.

No one defending Beck but if you hate extremist, hate every extremist..

                    Do you mean like Samir Shabazz who didn't support President Obama campaign at all. I wonder if someone didn't pay him off? It's kind of strange that people are angry at a guy holding a mop handle and weighing about a buck and ten pounds when in Arizona people carry machine guns to the polls to question Hispanic peoples citizenship.

What's wrong with carrying a handgun into a polling place?  I do it all the time thanks to a concealed carry permit.  I also take it to the wal-mart, the mall and my kid's school.  Is there anything wrong with that.  I'm not trying to intimidate others, I just won't be caught as the victim in a deadly force situation.

                    You have got to be effing kidding.  You're really going to try the false equivalency between the dozens and dozens of racists incidents and dogwhistle politics to two guys outside a polling place in 2008?  Are you daft?  That's your defense?  Wow.  And you started off this thread by protesting that we call you wingnuts stupid.

                    That doesn't mean that there are only two black racists.  Another fine example of wingnut reading comprehension.

                    Indeed I do...and you seem extremely attached to that "strawman" theme.  Wingnut...again, is the stability of the loose screw.  Since you all seem bent on the "wingnut" calling, I'll take that as a compliment and refer to you as the liberal loose screw.  Ohhhh, but that would be mean, so I'll take it back and leave the name calling to yourselves.

                    Wasn't this debate about an article that refutes so-called ad hominem attacks?  You guys take it to a whole new level.  Try defending your point lest you all look like fools.  
So the guy expresses incredulity at your assertion that the New Black Panther guys who made the news were the only black on white incident in the entire country, so what.  He's right, it wasn't.  As is the assertion that there has never been a racist Tea Partier.  
Only problem is that when the racist shows his colors at the Tea Party he is more likely to be shown the door.  The One Nation rally showed us who those groups were willing to support openly.  Many of them were not in favor of our One Nation (the USA).  One Nation of what, sheep?

that's why you guys lose  We lose what?  Political office?  I'm assuming you meant elections.  So how exactly are we losing?  We're going to keep the Senate, and even if we lose the House, not exactly a done deal, it'll be by only a few seats.  But you go ahead and say something stupid, wingnut.  It's what y'all do best.

                    So a section of the voting electorate should just sit down and not be allowed a place in the table. Isn't this the same bullcrap conservatives love to say about liberals? That liberals don't allow opposite opinions.

                    Interesting that Evil Conservatives can create an account here (or on any other supposedly Stalinistic lib/prog blog) and post their thoughts and links to con blogs, but I've tried to post on every conservative site and have been lifetime-banned from Hannity.com, and simply censored on every other con blog I attempt to post on. I was banned from Hannity's site for the simple offense of having a different opinion. I did not swear. I respected others opinions. The moderator's reason was simply that I was a "liberal troll".

Enjoy your freedom, Evil Con, here on the other side of the aisle. See, you're still in America when you travel through Liberal USA. Not so in your world.

                    Oh yeah, totally thats what we do. Thats why we lost in 2006...hm, wait. Well surely we lost in 2008, after everyone had seen the liberal politicians and media hiding in 'Ivory Towers' right? ...Whats that? Elected with the highest popular vote ever in history? A democrat, really? Huh. Well then definetly, people are at least unhappy with the democrats, right..?! ...Oh..Well... Okay, but thats clearly a fluke. Its not like multiple polls show democrats as more trusted on every issue than republicans, and Obama more popular than Bush at the same point in Bush's presidency...Oh, they do? 

Well, it must be the biggest coverup known to man, where 150,000,000 people agreed to pretend to vote for Obama, and keep up the lie after he won the election. Because clearly, the right wing CANT be more unpopular than the party that doesnt fight endless pointless wars and doesnt spend its capital persuing frivilous, endless legal actions, instead using its time and energy to help people despite the intense, and often horrific shouts of "Socialist WOLF!" from the right.

Eh, bored. Thats exactly why they trust us more, idiots. thats why we *WON* the last two elections, handily. Your side had all those years in control to not handle these "hot button" issues you teabaggers have...But they didnt. They could have criminalized homosexuality...they didnt. They could have reinforced our borders and increased immigration controls..They didnt.

Why is that, you may be wondering? Cause if they DID, they couldnt use those issues as a carrot to make the right's brainwashed cadres vote for them in droves. Hook, line, sinker. Spend the next four years pillaging the economy, then repeat as above. Thats what happens when a party exists only as a COUNTER to another party: Should they ever be victorious, the party has no reason to vote itself into power anymore. So they can NEVER be victorious. So they will always lose when push comes to shove.

The left governs. The right steals and whines. The orcs are always with us.

                    Many of the pseudo-Cons out there deeply recent being called racist.  I've run across it at the office.  They're outraged at being lumped in with one or two people.  (Does it matter that this person is a flaming homophobe?  Or that they crowed about saving taxpayer dollars when the police shot and killed someone with a gun?)  The Teabagger movement isn't all racist, nor are all of them bigots, but so many of them are angry, scared, spoiled, politically naive, and short-sighted. They don't necessarily mean to be selfish or insensitve, they just acheive it.

                    I suppose calling Tea Party people "Teabaggers" is your definition of being "sensitive", "non angry", "not spoiled" "politically intelligent" and certainly not "short-sighted".  And of course all NON Tea Party people have no bigotry, no racists, no violent members...all perfect human beings with no political agendas. Absolutely just wonderful, rose colored...happy, unselfish, perfect people.  Really?

                    Why do pseudo-Cons always try to accuse "Liberals infiltrators" of doing all the bad stuff at Teapotties?  Trust me, if you talk to the people holding these signs up, they will be very insistent and indignant that you say such a thing.  They'd also deny being homophobic or racist and outraged that you would make such a declaration.

                    Sorry, I didn't ask names, I didn't really want to know.  But, I took some of their pictures, and when they saw my camera, they were all too happy to show me their signs.  When I asked the man with the sign that said America was a Christian Nation to show me that in the Constitution, he told me to leave the public rally and the guy sitting next to him told me that I was a bad Christian.  Sorry, I don't want to know names of people like this, and most of them would only accuse me of spying on them.

                    Uh oh, epk, you must have been talking to some of those leftists infiltrators.  :)

See, you need to prove that any pictures of teabaggers are actually teabaggers. Otherwise, the faithful will just say they're "plants".

                    I know, and even then, somehow, they would still refuse to believe it.  One of the counterprotesters at Beckfest was scratched by a granny would tried to tear the sign out of the guys hands because they weren't supposed to bring signs.

                    Yep, that's what I thought.  So easy to say you didn't want names and easier to say you were actually there with actual Tea Party Patriots.  Lame again.

                    I was actually there.  I have posted pictures in the past on this website.  I was also at the Reston Town Hall.  You can search for it on YouTube.  I'm the woman with the ruffled collar blouse, sunglasses and braided pony-tail.    

These are the ones I posted on 9/12/09:

This is the link from Beckfest
http://cid-8fa5718388d6cbd2.photos.live.com/browse.aspx/8-28-10%20Distorting%20Honor%20Rally

This is the link I posted on March 20th, the day before the Health Care Reform bill passed:

http://cid-8fa5718388d6cbd2.photos.live.com/browse.aspx/Anti-Health%20Care%20Rally%20Saturday%5EJ%20March%2020%5EJ%202010

I make no claims at being unbiased.  I am a Liberal, plain and simple.  I attended these rallies to see if I would see with my own eyes the things I had seen on MSNBC and other places.  I did see them.  As to whether you think I'm a bad person or not, you are free to think what you will.  I will consider the source, a mean-spirited troll for a lying, malicious, evil fraud.  I'm willing to face God for my sins at any time.  I'm forgiven, not perfect.

                    Yes, indeed, you are a mean troll.  I was making comments, and yes, they are fairly broad.  But they were based on my experiences.  I wasn't speaking of individuals.  I rarely call private individuals names. (I have no problem saying negative personal comments about people like Beck and Limbaugh, they put themselves and their ugliness on public display.)  I allow people to think what they want to think and to express themselves as they choose.  I've been fairly respectful and civil to you.  You haven't been to me.  I'm not whining, I'm a simple fact.  There were lots of things I could have said but choose not to.  I was being civil.  

I'm 50 years old.  I started watching politics in 1968.  I started voting in 1978.  Republicans have ruled the White House for 28 of the last 42 years.  I also lived overseas on a military base as a Civil Servant.  In my life, I have been shouted down, sworn at, called un-American, or unpatriotic, or unChristian, and scolded for being a Liberal repeatedly.  And for most of that, I've smiled and backed away in intimidated silence.  So, I find it ironic that when I express anger or contempt for the groups that have scorned me, I am lectured, once again, about being able to dish it out but not to take it.  In reality, I take it very well, and it takes a lot for me to outright call someone a name.  But your attitude gives me so much freedom.  You're a nasty troll with a mean attitude.

                    Oh, that's okay, we all know how you wingnuts have to compensate for your short comings.  In the battle of wits, you're so ill-equipped, this is what passes for biting humor.  No comments on the fact or the photos presented, just a weak little quip that so clearly demonstrates you impotence.  Oh, and yes, I'm being condescending, RightPrick.

                    Amazing how one can hurl so many names in one post...here's an example of yet another "tolerant" Left leaning tolerant post.  Let's see: "wingnut", "compensate for your short comings", "wits are so ill-equipped", you(should be your)impotence", and of course the new name...."RightPrick"...how imaginative is that?

                    I didn't say I was being imaginative, I said I was being condescending to someone I consider witless, limp, and mean.  Now, obviously, I have come to the point where I can't be civil anymore, so I'm going to back off now, because beating off a dead horse is pointless.  Have a nice day.

"when they rebute..."

Sorry, I don't speak Palinese or Trollish.  Did you mean refute, rebut, or rebuke?

In case you didn't notice, you're trying to tell me what I think.  

My idea of mean is someone with an axe to grind coming here with an attitude and saying pointless, silly things, making accusations, and being rude.  You wore out your welcome, and demonstrated that you don't deserve civil treatment.  Your actions seem to indicate you came here looking for a fight, and well, I obliged.  It's okay for you.  You got what you wanted.  You came here to behave badly and to get others to behave badly, that is what trolls do.  You weren't able to refute anything, you didn't attempt to rebut anything, and your rebukes aren't clever or funny.  You troll for an evil man who would sell you out or turn on you in an instant.  You're boring, and that is the worst thing I've said to you today.  I'm done.  Now, run on over to The Blaze and brag about what a brave little troll you are.  I'm sure your fellow Beckerheads will welcome you with open arms.

No. Semi-illiterates like you just need to get their information pre-digested and spoon fed in bumper-sticker sized sound bites by Fox.
If Beck had read the above to you, you'd be all ears.
I guess the next time you try to defend your point by saying you "researched" it (if you ever do), should we just remind you that you are an admitted ADD suffering illiterate without the concentration skills to read a couple hundred words in one sitting?  Or, should be assume that your "research" consisted of an hour of Beck?

                    Oh...this could be fun...the other day I was at a Code Pink, NCAA, Obama/Soros rally and this guy with a sign that said epkkk851 is a racist human being, so I asked him where he could prove that..and he said...hmmm, yep...he said that he just knows it and then they insulted me.  The guys next to this guy told me I was a bad Rightie.  Sorry, I don't want to know names of people like that and most of them would also accuse me of spying on them.  Yep...that's exactly what happened, so there's my proof you're a bad person.

How can you claim to embrace personal responsibility while blaming any embarrassing members of your movement on Saul Alinsky or George Soros or whatever scary Jewy-Jewy-Jew-Jew you claim is controlling everything this week?

                    You didn't have to say it; I just can't help but notice that you accuse one Jew of being behind everything you hate and another of starting the whole thing. When the right rants about Soros, they sound like someone went through something by Henry Ford replacing every use of "Jew" with Soros. And by the way, n00b, you can't "delete" posts here. And you've accidentally revealed precisely why Beck and his worshipers hate Media Matters: they put up his words for everyone to see, so he (and you) can't deny them. If there were no MMfA, Beck would probably just claim he never called Obama a racist, and he might have gotten away with it.

MMfA puts up clips of Beck (and others) actually saying the things he is being taken to task for. Why does this upset folks who, it would seem, enjoy or like Glenn Beck's program?

                    No assumption necessary, wingnut.  You lie with dogs, you get fleas.  You're defending Glenn Beck with nothing more than implication and innuendo, and when you get called on it, you retreat to the "not me" defense so popular with teabaggers.  Defending racism is racism.

You have yet provided a credible argument against the premise of the article, just the usual pantheon of wingnut fallacies.  You want respect and tolerance?  Argue from an honest perspective.

I'm not a fan of the Tea Party, but it's beyond disingenuous to justify calling them Teabaggers simply because some of them initially called themselves that (clearly out of ignorance).

                    I agree.

I NEVER call them TeaBaggers, and wouldn't, just because it causes issues. They disavow that name.

I object to righties using "Democrat Party" for the same reason.

DEMOCRATS get to decide what the name of their party is, and the opposing party doesn't get to decide on their own that they'd prefer them to not be called the Democratic Party.

And Tea Party members get to decide that they don't like being called TeaBaggers.

                    Hey, Doofus, what OTHER people do doesn't/shouldn't affect OUR behavior.

Just because other people torture those they capture, it doesn't justify us torturing THEM when we capture THEM.

And nope, they don't have to extend that courtesy to US in order for US to behave the way that WE SHOULD behave!

And it sickens me that YOU think that your behavior should be predicated on the behavior of others. Reasonable, mature adults don't act that way, dummy.

                    That's a good point, and I use "Tea Partiers" now. Usually. But I think some of the people who called themselves teabaggers knew exactly what it meant. It's hard to take "Teabag the liberals before they teabag you" any differently.

                    Liberals are people, too.  We have our share of good folks, bad folks, humorless folks, and angry folks.  I would say that most of us are better educated, and we are definately more sensitive to the needs of others, since being tolerant and advancing the rights of individuals and groups is the thing that drives us into politics.  

Teabaggers are the ones who decided to take teabags and hang them from their misspelled signs and their hats and to send them by the gross to Congress.  They even called themselves Teabaggers until they found out what it meant.  And I might not have kept calling them Teabaggers if they hadn't insisted on calling people like me Socialists, Communists, Nazis and evil Progressives. 

 I went to a Town Hall in 2009, I was excited, thrilled to be there, then this pseudo-Con woman showed up in line behind me spewing the nastiest, angriest crap, and when I tried to talk to her, she accused me of being angry, that Liberals were always angry.  I told her the truth, I hadn't been angry until she showed up and brought my mood down.  Also, at the same Town Hall, I saw a really big guy trying to pick a fight with a much younger and smaller Jewish guy, and when the young man went to security, the man openly mocked him with whining and crying sounds.  When I have talked to Teabaggers and I bring up stubborn things like facts, I get yelled at or told to go home, or that facts don't matter.

                    You say "most of us are better educated"...prove it?  Statitistics please.  That is definately the more egotistical post I've seen in awhile.  Oh, and definitately more "sensitive".  In what ways specifically as opposed to whom you deem less sensitive?  What a wide brush you paint.  That my dear is uneducated in itself.  And no...they did not call themselves "teabaggers"...the left wing media labeled and the walking zombies of the left followed.  Good try though.  I have to give you an A for effort.  Gosh, you went to a town hall and a woman was vulgar..let's play chess...because...I can match that with any given day of vulgar Left Wingers.  So what we got is that both sides have equal responsibility for any vulgarity.  Both sides could do more for civility.

You say "most of us are better educated"...prove it?
Well, for starters, you just demonstrated that you have no idea how question marks work.

                    Wow...that was a good one Sozeeee..who would have thought that posting on a blog could determine intelligence or not.  Shall we do spell check for all you left wingers?  Or are all Lefties perfect spellers and or perfect "questions mark" peeps?  Hmmm, maybe a typo dear sozeeeee.  One thing I stink at is typing but golly...that must be because you are soooo much more intelligent.  Very lame, very lame.

                    Education and political affliation, one of several articles I found by googling.

http://chronicle.com/article/Education-Level-Linked-to/43433/

How are Liberals more sensitive?  Well, we don't mock death row prisoners seeking clemency.  We work to get health coverage for the poor.  We seek to educate the poor and illiterate. And yes, some of the people did call themselves Teabaggers until they found out what it meant.  And I didn't say the woman was vulgar, I said she was angry and nasty, but she was not vulgar.  You just made that up.  And thank you for demonstrating the proper pseudo-Con attitude of snotty sanctimony.  It's so nice to have someone prove my point for me.

                    Can't come up with anbything other than mockery? epkklk was actually trying to engage you in debate and you come back with this? Yet you cannot understand why most folks here won't take you seriously? Do you even wish to be taken seriously?

                    No, he doesn't want to be taken seriously. He DOESN'T want to participate in a fair and reasonable debate on the actual topic of this MMFA article, or on ANY topic!

And that's why, when that kind of post is uncovered, the APPROPRIATE response is for ONE person to briefly debunk what the troll post said, mock the poster (because that's what everyone wants to do, and in order to indulge that need, we need to have that first responder mock them) and then we need that first poster to warn others to NOT feed the troll, and we need the other posters to understand how THEY are doing EXACTLY what the troll wants when they feed the troll's desire to get negative attention!

                    You have failed yet again, regurgitation queen. See, here's the thing: some people actually like  to get into it with these idiots. It's amusing. You're not. You're just boring. Your rules are stupid, and that's why no one follows them. The ongoing RightPride smackdown is a lot more interesting than anything you've ever said.

                    I'm okay with Dolly.  I went to The Blaze.  I wrote things in defense of liberals or against Glenn that I knew would get a rise.  I got lots of rises.  Lots of people went out of their way to be rude and nasty to me, really base, juvenile low blows.  After a shockingly short while, I gave in and was rude and nasty back.  It wasn't really amusing for me.  It just made me feel dirty.  I still visit the site but I almost never post a single word. (It still turns my stomach or gets me riled, but I don't leave evidence behind.)  Trolling won't change their minds, but it does change my behavior.  I become something I don't like.

                    I FULLY and completely understand that SOME people LIKE getting into it with these idiots.

But that's not the way they SHOULD behave.

I am baffled as to why you think that I didn't already KNOW that some people LIKE getting into it with trolls.

That doesn't CHANGE the damage that is done to our national discourse when people feed troll posts, idiot!

I've never denied that it's satisfying to mock these folks, which is WHY, doofus, when I say how people SHOULD respond to troll posts, they should MOCK them - because that's what EVERYBODY wants to do!

My rules are NOT stupid. But YOU'RE so full of personal animus that you can't even figure out that you're wrong here, apparently.

And NO ongoing smackdown of a troll is more interesting than anything that I've ever written, but thanks for the baseless personal attack - I LOVE it when you fools dig your own graves!

The multiple posts feeding the troll poster were EXACTLY what the troll wanted, dummy. It did no good, it informed no one, and it hurt the discussion of the ACTUAL topic here. That distraction from the actual topic is what the troll wanted to do, and posters here HELPED the troll accomplish that goal. There's no amount of amusement that can be gained from a smackdown of a troll that's worth that damage, doofus.

Yet you suggest that it's a good idea. 

And that's because YOU'RE a troll too.

                    Seriously, if you want to make your statements credible in the face of this forum, you should reinforce them with solid sources.  While epkklk's source was a little iffy he was at least trying to back his opinions with objective truth. You, RightPride (very subtle name BTW), simply pick at your opponents wording and phrasing even when forced to defend yourself intellectually. Try to take this debate seriously or your opinions will no longer be accepted as credible by anyone above a middle-school education. Step it up or STFUGTFO plz. :)

                    Yeah I care about Americas future as it relates to the lighter skinned Americans.(Glen Beck 2010) Also, Every single ruler whoever presided over a culture on this planet has had at least a couple of ideas that have been accepted as "viable" governing tools. As humans we evolve by taking what works and incorporating it into what we are already doing to attempt to improve our processes. I don't care whom you name including Hitler that most Kings, Shahs, Presidents, whatever have not learned from or gleaned from a way to deal with people and govern over them. Obviously Hitler is a stupid example but nonetheless I bet that he did something right in the time he ruled the German people that wasn't evil and applies to current accepted practice by most everyone. We adapt, we learn ,we try to grow and by doing that we take what works and cast aside what doesn't. Glen can't do the math on that theory though. It's capitalism till he dies. 100% capitalism 24/7. Capitalism is great until people get greedy, then not so much.

                    This guy is like advertising in that you laugh at what he's saying and how he says it, at first not believing it.  But after awhile you find yourself believing; just like ads.  Why do companies spend so much on ads?

Guess you can get a pass on your hatred based the fact your insults discriminate against a group of people of different races as opposed to only one race.  Too funny.

                    Boehner is orange. Thus, he might qualify as a race of his own. Cons don't get humor. It's one of their many mental deficiencies.

What I do care about is their ability to obfuscate to the point of obscuring the debate. If cons had game, they wouldn't have to lie at every turn.

                    Yes. It's a waste of time. Nobody's mind is ever changed. The cons don't have the mental capacity or self-awareness to examine their beliefs and change them. Liberals on this board are only faced with the flaccid recitation of talking points, which of course will never change any thinking person's mind. Thus, it's useless. In my opinion, the only use of this discussion board is to sharpen our rhetorical skills and learn some new jokes.

                    The Blaze.com is Glenn's vanity press operations that publicizes all things Glenn and reflects his take on current events.  I don't recommend it.

When, I wonder, does this collection of stupid mannerisms, and tics, and sophomoric attempts at humor, and half-witted, sarcastic ad hominem attacks wear thin, even for the base?

I know exactly why I dislike you, Glenn.  It's because you incite hatred, and division, and you lie.  And because you hurt my country.

                    As embarrassing as this is for me to admit, my grandfather is a member of the Tea Party Patriots; he is also THE biggest racist I have ever known.  The kicker (in my opinion): he was a firefighter all his life; therefore, every paycheck he received in his professional career was due to taxes, and every paycheck and benefit he now receives is due to taxes.

Some of us actually know tea partiers, and for some of us, that person(s) is a direct reflection of how they're perceived in the public.  There is a reason Beck can't refute the report.

                    Isn't your grandfather a member of your family?  Does that mean your family...including yourself is racist?  You're accusing Tea Party Patriots as Racist because your grandfather...who is racist...is a member.  beDecent, that would clearly state that you must be a racist by your own definition of guilt by association or membership.  And you are a member of your racist grandfathers family.

Mine however, showed the poster that he was merely painting people as racists because they were members of the same group as his grandfather...kinda like he's from the same family as his racist grandfather.  Therefore....beDecent is a racist.

                    Let's start here, Lightning;

my grandfather is a member of the Tea Party Patriots; he is also THE biggest racist I have ever known

Do you understand that it wouldn't have been necessary to add the second part if beDecent was making the assumption that all teabaggers were racist ?

You're accusing Tea Party Patriots as Racist because your grandfather...who is racist...is a member

No, BeDecent didn't do that at all.

I've never heard anybody say that everybody in the tea party club is racist, but I constantly hear teabaggers whining that everybody is saying that.

There is quite a bit of racism in among the teabaggers( well-documented), and it's obviously a pretty racist-friendly group. This is easy to tell even just looking at their public behavior, when most of them are likely trying to put up a reasonable appearance.

Bedecent was adding his personal experience, that the most racist person he's ever known is a teabagger. I live in a pretty conservative area, and I could add the racist .emails I get from Republican friends and co-workers. We actually live in the real world.

Up to speed yet? Nobody knows if all teabaggers or right wingers are racist , but racists generally seem attracted to the right wing/teabagger side of things.

                    Um, I could add that by Bedecent stating his grandfather was a racist and being a member of the Tea Party provided reason to think they were is beyond your spinning.  I concluded that by his very own reasoning, him of course being a member of his grandpas dear family, that people could conclude the same of his family as he is concluding of the Tea Party.  By the way, I have a kid on a soccer team of which a black couple make it completely well known that they hate all white people, hate all Right wingers.  Would I assume that means they are racist and that all Left leaning and all blacks are racists?

                    No, I am not painting every tea partier with one brush; neither does the report, if you read it.  There are too many tea partiers to say that they're all racists--just as there are too many Muslims to say that they're all terrorists.  Intelligent people realize that.

The TPM, though, adamantly denies any racist happenings at their gatherings, when there is proof of the contrary.  THAT is why Beck can't deny the report; he can only mock it and mock who commissioned it.

                    BeDecent, are you a racist?  The way your 1st post went, you tried to prove the Tea Party as racist because your grandpappy is a member.  However, you failed to point out that you are indeed a "member" of his family....for a whole lot longer than he's been in the Tea Party.  Is your dad or mom or cousins or aunts racist?  Just asking. How are those Thanksgiving dinners when he goes on a racist rant?  Guilt by association?

                    No, I am not a racist, but yes, my father has had some pretty racist inclinations.  And homophobic.  He also split when I was 15--ten years ago--and I haven't spoken with him since.

                    And once again, no, I did not try to "prove the Tea Party as racist because [my] grandpappy is a member."  My point--which is painfully obvious--is that Beck could not refute the report because there ARE instances of racism in the TPM.  It's a fact, which you also have not bothered to refute (in your response to me, anyway--I have not read the whole thread).

                    I think rightpride impressed himself so much with his badly flawed analogy that he's going to stick with it, no matter how many times the problems with it are pointed out.

And what's with the obsession with "proud" and "pride" in the wingnuts' screen names ? Is this some little self-esteem trick people with nothing to be proud of use to build themselves up ?

                    He also stopped responding when, really, there was nothing else for him to say without repeating his badly flawed analogy.

I found the "pride" in his name pretty amusing as well; is it just me, or does "RightPride" sound like a pun on "White Pride"?

                    It may have picked that nick subconsciously - something in the brain triggered "White Pride".

Or it may be deliberate, thinking that nobody would catch it. Wingnuts always have a ridiculously inflated sense of their own cleverness.

Either way, that's one of the dumbest trolls I've seen at any website in a while. It's almost sad, because you know it spends all day listening to Rush and Glenda tell it how smart it is, building up it's confidence.

Then it comes here, and alternates between playing the condescending, mocking attack dog, then the whining sensitive victim when it gets its azz handed to it repeatedly.

Seen it so many times, but it's still sad. But funny.

Some of us actually know tea partiers, and for some of us, that person(s) is a direct reflection of how they're perceived in the public. 

The second instance of "some of us" further breaks down the "some of us" who know tea partiers.  For the liberals who do know tea partiers, SOME of those liberals' tea-party acquaintances are a shining example of how the public perceives the TPM.  In my case, the tea partier I know is my racist, tax-collecting grandfather.

                    That's fine.  You also think I'm a guy, so whatever you want to assume.  I'm neither, and I know it, so your perception doesn't phase me.  =)

                    I'm not sure I see where there is any violence in Beck's rhetoric. Is this like Ed Show saying he'll pee on people?

The NAACP report was rather overshadowed by all that foreign money and undue influence pouring into this site, NPR, and other media outlets from convicted criminal and admitted Nazi-enabler Soros.

There is nothing new in that report and it's been dismissed as petty... I mean what the heck does sovereignty and 'nativism' have to do with racism? Not one thing.

But the whiners on the left will say it's 'code words'.

If you say the sky is blue progressives will accuse you of using code words.

Best sign seen at rally: "Doesn't matter what's on this sign -- they will still say it's racist".

In other words, you have overplayed the race card and now, no one is listening.

And you can't really talk when the Soros empire, far more than just funding one group, is running the agenda here.

Talk about puppets and plutocrats!

                    Soros isn't a "Nazi enabler"; that's been repeatedly debunked. The reason you people cling to it is because you want to call everyone you disagree with a Nazi while clinging to the anti-Semitism that drives the Soros obsession.
I mean what the heck does sovereignty and 'nativism' have to do with racism?
Ummmm, the fact that the nativist movement is embraced by white supremacists and based around the notion that we're supposed to be an Anglo-Saxon nation? Look up the Klan's position on immigration.
In other words, you have overplayed the race card and now, no one is listening.
But by all means, let's continue insisting that Barack Obama hates white people and deliberately cropping clips of NAACP speakers to insist the same thing.

                    Hard to pick out a highlight in that mindless pile of Fox/GOP drivel, but this one is pretty tired;

In other words, you have overplayed the race card and now, no one is listening.

Translation: We've had our racism pointed out so many times we're just going to pretend we don't hear it anymore.

                    I'm still searching on this website for things that were said on NPR and no one got fired.

Nina Totenberg said she hoped Jesse Helms' would die of AIDS and his children would get AIDS.

People laughed at it...

Jesse Jackson said he feared being robbed by black people.

http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2010/10/21/nprs-intellectual-cowardice/

NPR should have its funding pulled for sure.
Double standard anyone?

That's not the half of it.. they are constantly bashing religions too.

                    What is this competition about which group has more of a monopoly on hate, or insults, or sensitivity? What a ridiculous conversation you are all having.

The facts are that our economy is suffering, and that Glenn Beck generally represents the point of view that central government action is going to make things worse. Other groups apparently disagree. No other issue is more salient to our contemporary national conversation. There is now reason why allegations of racism must constantly be brought into this conversation.

And, assuming you all are trying to make some progress, undermining each others' arguments with comments on grammar or intelligence will get you nowhere. But then again, you might just want to follow the traditional discussion board model.

Jesse Jackson said he feared being robbed by black people.

For the record, what Jesse Jackson actually said 18-odd years ago was that when he sees that a robber is white, he feels relieved, not because he fears black robbers more (which of course would only qualify as an off-color joke, not racism), but because he did not want to be reminded of the crime epidemic in the black community.

I'm sure no one is surprised that anonymoose would post Charles Krauthammer's distortion of Jesse Jackson's words as fact, just thought it was worth mentioning.

                    It would be hard for this site wanting Totenberg fired for something she said 15 years ago.  Also, it's highly possible the management of NPR today isn't the same people as it was then.

Nina Totenberg said she hoped Jesse Helms' would die of AIDS and his children would get AIDS.That's what we in the reality-based community call a lie.

You don't use her exact words because they'd prove you a liar. What she said was:
I think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the Good Lord's mind, because if there is retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will.It's not that different from a preacher telling people to repent or face the consequences. Of course, that's only OK on the right.

Sure, but in Teabagistan, they call lies "interesting facts".

I've been looking over the Glenda-related threads the past couple of days, laughing at the Beckbot infestation, and it's amazing how many times they paraphrase, misinterpret, or just plain make up things, yet don't hesitate to put quotation marks around the BS they're attributing to some "leftist".

It's one of those chicken/egg conundrums. Are people whose logic centers are wired wrong drawn to beck, or is it years of listening to beck that screws up the brain wiring? A little of both ?

They just don't seem to think like normal humans.

                    Beck is a paid member of the Kochtopus.  The other members in that kennel deny the facts that Beck is a liar and many members of the Tea Party are open racists.  

The people who do not live in denial are leaving the New Tea Party.   

Here is one reason that the message spewed forth from Fox News is bad for America.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment.  

Yes, a person perceived as a legitimate authority figure can get another person to torture and kill another human being.  This is scientific fact. 

The numbers do not lie.  For the people who believe that Beck is a legitimate authority figure, over 60% of them would push the Kill button.

                    Noone was talking about whether or not people would kill for Glenn Beck if he asked them too. What does the Milgram experiment have to do with anything? Do you always find such attenuated reasons to relate everyday issues to psychological studies?

Do you have blue eyes datruthfarmer? Everyone knows people with blue eyes shouldn't post on websites.

                    boulderlonghairedhippyfreak, the stats provided datruthfarmer come from the link that was also provided.  Since you didn't take the time to read it.  It states In Milgram's first set of experiments, 65 percent (26 of 40)[1] of experiment participants administered the experiment's final massive 450-volt shock, though many were very uncomfortable doing so; at some point, every participant paused and questioned the experiment, some said they would refund the money they were paid for participating in the experiment. Only one participant steadfastly refused to administer shocks below the 300-volt level

                    It doesn't matter so much that the NAACP is questioning the Teaparty.They are showing their true colors all the time,but have gotten a little smarter about the obvious signs they displayed more frequently early on.Just look at:
 - Virtually no demonstrted TP anger at GW Bush 
 -The Mark Williams letter
 -Tea party Queen Palin attacks the NAACP
 -Palin makes no mention of Williams' letter
 -Gingrich/Beck(TP Kings) embrace D'Souza racist article
 -Paladrino racist emails
 -Rand Paul anti Civil Rights position
 -Va Beach teaparty Republican racist black dog email
 -Texas Tea Party voter intimidation against Minorities
 -POTUS attacked as "angel of Death by Colorado TP group
 -Dick Armey accuses Dem Minority early voters of voter fraud
 -Several racist Billboards against POTUS this year
 -Viral attacks against NAACP for seeing racist elements in TP 
 -TP racism always denied by TP leaders( ex M. Williams)
 -TP defends Breitbart and O'Keefe
 - TP only sees racism in NAACP,POTUS,Holder,Sotomayor,1stLady
If the Tea Party wanted real credibility on the issue they would acknowledge what is there even if small and vow to eliminate it.They only deny it or down play its significance.As old as most TP members are,they should know that a little racism goes a long way!!!

                    I can generally find something, some common ground, with just about anyone.  I don't like 'hate' it is a very ugly word for a very ugly emotion.  Yet, it is not nearly strong enough or negative enough for what I feel for g.b.  He (it) is the scum of the Earth.  Every breath it takes is a crime against Humanity.

                    Has it occurred to anyone else that the whole TP movement may just be a way, a filter so to speak, contrived by the repubs to skim off the more ignorant and racist element, thereby polishing their image.  The repubs would like to focus their party on their core values, further enrichment of the wealthy and corporations.  

The racists and poor white trash elements of the republican party have gotten to the point where they are interfering with the agenda.  They have become a lightning rod and a distraction.  The best way to fix it is to fund the TP, manufacture false populism and watch those elements defect.  This is a pretty clever strategy.  The TP will still be helping the repubs under the "enemy of my enemy" rule, but they help the repubs plausibly repudiate the morans and racists that formerly only found comfort as Republicans if they didn't want to join some fringe party.

Of course, the calculation had to be made about how far this could go in splitting the repub vote but, overall, I think it's a net gain for repubs.  Also, repub candidates can always accuse TP candidates of being "liberal plants".  This is the tactic being used in poiltical ads where I live by repub candidates concerned with their TP opposition. Those who are ignorant enough to vote against their own interests, but not ignorant enough to become TP dupes believe it and vote R.

The "Southern Strategy" cost the Democrats the racist vote when the Dixiecrats fled to the welcoming arms of the Republican party after the CRA.  I think they have worn out their welcome and become a nuisance, but there was no legitimate sounding party onto which they could be offloaded.  Therefore, the wealthier republicans needed to create one from whole cloth.  And the TP was born.

What do you think of 14-year-old Chloe Moretz’s mature ensemble at the ‘Hick’ TIFF premiere?By Leigh McEachranBloggerPostsBy Leigh McEachran | North Stars – Sun, 11 Sep, 2011 12:38 PM EDT


Young Hollywood stars have a tendency to grow up too fast and from the look of her outfit at last night's "Hick" TIFF premiere, 14-year-old Chloe Moretz may have fallen victim to that trend.
The young actress, who starred in the kid-friendly comedy "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" just one year ago, wore a leather Valentino dress to the Sept. 10 premiere at the Winter Garden Theatre. Although long-sleeved, the top of the dress is sheer - revealing lacy undergarments -  before changing to black leather at the waist. And the dress cuts off at mid-thigh! Moretz paired the design with a smoky eye, pink lip and sleek, pulled-back hair. The mature ensemble was completed by nude heels.

Perhaps the "Kick-Ass" actress' new look is inspired by her darker role in "Hick," the new film which she stars in alongside "Gossip Girl"'s Blake Lively. In the flick, Moretz plays a 13-year-old runaway named Luli who leaves home for Las Vegas.

But since Moretz isn't actually a Las Vegas runaway, perhaps she should ditch the ensemble. Her outfit at The Variety Studio at Holt Renfrew earlier that day, for example, displayed a more age-appropriate way to incorporate leather (she apparently really likes that material).
What do you think of Chloe Moretz's TIFF outfit? OK to wear or too revealing for a 14 year old?

This is a 20 year old woman who's chronigical age is 14. She probably knows more about legal documents and family law than anyone here who has written a comment.

If it were my 14 y.o. daughter, I would be a lot more comfortable if the sheer part of the dress began above the lacy bra instead of below.  In fact I think most adult women would probably not feel comfortable wearing a dress like this either.

However, this is for a Hollywood premiere and it does look quite classy.  I have seen a lot worse on adult women at Hollywood premieres and awards shows.  Give the kid a break.  She's pulled off a very mature look without looking trashy.  As for her other outfit, it looks a little too immature for a Hollywood premiere.

Too hypocritical, bathing suits are smaller than underwear, and would that be too revealing, come on folks get real.

She looks incredible, but she's dressing way too old.  Keep that up and they can start casting her as a 14 year old's mother.

*shrug* The only people who think this is 'too reveling' are probally looking at 14 year old girls to much.

i actually like her outfit, its the movie , that i thought was oversexed :O...i was there at the premiere and trust me im no prude, nor am i old and jealous but i was taken aback on how open the film was in sexually exposing her...i mean she was in cut off shorts and tight crop tops the whole movie...and i dont know much about filming but the lense semed to be stuck on her pouty lips and thighs...um ya that being said , i thought no way is she thirteen in real life(i didnt know of her other roles) that conforted me throughout the film , but yea she is beautiful but looks older then me and im 20....this is hollywood people

If any man on here was truly honest he about this young gals dress, if it were your daughter you'd flip out with all the old men and young ogling her. Then we wonder why pedophiles kidnap and rape our kids. She's a little girl dressed as woman.

When she's 24 she's gonna regret not being a kid for as long as she could... don't we all?

Um, for anyone who saw the movie Kickass, you will remember her very adult language for an 11-year old. Yes, the C-word! Obviously she's been made to act far beyond her years. Not surprised with the outfit. Not outraged.

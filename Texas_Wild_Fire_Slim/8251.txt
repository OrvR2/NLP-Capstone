Danish family released by Somali piratesBy JAN M. OLSEN - Associated Press | AP – 19 hrs ago

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A Danish yachting family held hostage by Somali pirates for more than six months has been released and is returning home after enduring "the most horrible ordeal one can imagine," government officials said.Jan Quist Johansen, his wife Birgit Marie and their three teenage children were captured along with two Danish crew members on Feb. 24 as their 43-foot (13-meter) yacht was seized by pirates in the Indian Ocean.All seven "were released Tuesday and are doing well under the circumstances. They are in a plane on their way to Denmark," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Charlotte Slente said.She declined to comment further on the circumstances of the release and wouldn't say whether a ransom had been paid.The Johansens, from Kalundborg, 75 miles (120 kilometers) west of Copenhagen, were on a round-the-world journey when they approached the pirate-infested waters off the Horn of Africa. Their travel blog showed they were aware of the dangers but didn't expect to get into trouble, and were comforted by the sight of anti-piracy forces patrolling the vast area.News of their release was met with relief in their home town."The family very likely is aware that what they did was not so fortunate. They certainly feel pretty bad about it now," said Ole Meridin Petersen, chairman of the Kalundborg yacht club, in which Jan Quist Johansen was a member.Hostages are held in hot, austere conditions in Somalia — typically for many months — before a ransom is agreed on and paid, and the hijacked ships and crew are released. Last year, a British sailing couple were released after 388 days in captivity. Reports indicated that a ransom in the region of $1 million was paid for their release.Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen told Danish news agency Ritzau that Denmark doesn't pay ransom "as a matter of principle," adding it was the family, not the Foreign Ministry, that had been negotiating with the pirates. The family was "advised by professional negotiators," she said.Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said negotiations carried on for "a long period" before the hostages were freed."I am really happy on behalf of the family, which since Feb. 24 has been through the most horrible ordeal one can imagine," Loekke Rasmussen said. "It is important that we now give the family quiet and peace."The Foreign Ministry said two Danes and four Filipinos from Danish cargo ship M/V Leopard are still being held by Somali pirates after the vessel was attacked off Somalia on Jan. 12, 2011.Somalia hasn't had a functioning government since 1991, one of the reasons the piracy trade has flourished.

So a shoot-out with the pirates would have yielded a better outcome how?

The back-story to this that rarely gets told is that these pirates used to be humble fisherman. The gigantic multi-million dollar foreign fishing boats dropped illegal long-lines and nets inside their waters (even though their ships were outside) and wiped out their fish.  Now they have no livelihood, so they started going after the fishing boats.   Piracy is never the right choice, but neither is illegal fishing.  (Especially when you're starving poor families just for greed's sake).  The U.N. should step in and right this wrong before this situation gets even worse.

Why isn't the UN addressing the issues in Somalia?  Isn't that what they say their job is?

I still cannot understand why the World's naval powers cannot exterminate the pirate scum once and for all. Is it because they are black, Muslim, or both?
Screw political correctness, screw the pirates, Somalia, Africa, and Islam.

These Somali piracy is the consequence of the corporate world stealing away from the people.

I'm glad they're safe, but they should by all rights pay for all the expenses of this situation. They wandered into pretty much the ONLY pirate infested waters in the world thinking "nothing would happen" to them because, well, because they're so special, right? It's one thing to be an idiot alone, it's another to willfully put your family at risk out of arrogance.

Am I supposed to feel for people who knew the danger but went headlong into it anyway expecting to be protected by some devine influence that protects all rich people? Too dam bad you got yourselves detained by pirates that you knew how to avoid but chose not to.

Very basically, the world refuses to deal with/solve this pirate situation.  Just how hard would it be to eradicate this #$%$  Not that hard if anyone actually wanted to.  So, what would the reason be to not fix it?

The UN seems to be as useful as screen doors on a submarine.  Prove me wrong, please.

Ransoms should never be paid. Boats should be sunk with all on board - even the captives. Then efforts should be made to save the captives while killing the pirates on the spot. If the captives die it's too bad but many more will die without decisive and strong action.

Why can't the US or another country set a trap for these Somali pirates, like a  6 man Seal team in a 43 ft yacht !!! No more pirates just fish food !

why isn't somalia a smoking crater by now? answer because the large govts.have nothing to get out of the area and nobody who was kidnapped had the family with the money or arms to reduce the area to a smoking ruin.

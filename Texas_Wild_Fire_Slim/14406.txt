The Worst Forest Fire In Colorado History http://www.inciweb.org/incident/2119/Fourmile Canyon (Boulder County): 6,422 acres at 30 percent contained. This fire is 12 miles northwest of Boulder. Residences are threatened, roads are closed and evacuations are in effect.http://www.thedenverchannel.com/fourmilecanyonfire/24928787/detail.html     map of fire destruction"Not much has changed from last night," Banuelos says. "The fire is at least 3,500 acres in size, and there's been a forced mandatory evacuation of more than 3,000 residents. I don't have a count on structures destroyed yet, but an investigation team will go on site today to catalog burned structures and begin the investigation process into a potential cause." Banuelos estimates that "more than 100 firefighters are working to contain the active fire, manning 35 engines from thirty local agencies." Authorities aren't releasing information about the percentage of the fire contained, if partial containment has been achieved, or a prediction about when folks will be able to return to their homes -- those lucky enough to still have homes, that is. As such, the evacuation order remains in effect for communities east of the Peak to Peak Highway, south of Lefthand Canyon Drive and north of Boulder Canyon Drive, aka Colorado Highway 119.Displaced residents are encouraged to take shelter at the Coors Event Center, on the CU-Boulder campus, where the Red Cross has made food and water available. At this point, though, not many are taking advantage of the opportunity. According to Banuelos, only twelve people stayed there last night.n the meantime, Banuelos continues, "seven air tankers and three helicopters have joined the effort. They're expected to drop more than 90,000 gallons of fire retardant today." Thus far, there have been no reports of human injuries or deaths. As for animals, Banuelos says, "Boulder County will have animal control officers on scene to conduct animal evacuations when site access becomes available."

Slurry drop pilots, smoke jumpers, and﻿ more. I can't begin to thank enough all these hard working people who fight fires to keep us safe. We may not be able to thank you in person but we do appreciate your work.

Awesome! If there's a fire﻿ near your area, the best thing you can hope to see is an Aero Union P3 in the air!

I was the leadplane on this fire and remember every retardant drop that we put﻿ in including the first one at the red roof building at Gold Hill with Tanker 25.
Lead 4-7.

my house and with it the whole town of Gold Hill﻿ was saved by the first slurry drop on 9/6. Today 10/12 we're getting the first snow since the fire. Feels good.

By The Canadian Press
              VANCOUVER - Lululemon Athletica Inc.'s second-quarter profit rose 77 per cent to $38.4 million, as the clothing retailer benefited from stronger sales — prompting the company to raise its full-year revenue outlook.
The Vancouver-based company's profit was equal to 26 cents per share, up from 15 cents per share or $21.7 million in the comparable period a year ago.
Lululemon (TSX:LLL) said its revenue for the 13 weeks ended July 31 increased 39 per cent to $212.3 million from $152.2 million.
Comparable stores sales for the second quarter increased by 20 per cent on a constant dollar basis.
"Our business remained very healthy through the second quarter, as strong sales productivity and operating margins grew pre-tax income by more than 60 per cent," said Lululemon chief executive Christine Day said in a release.
"We are confident that we are well positioned to manage successfully through the current economic environment while sensibly pursuing our future opportunities."
The company also revised its outlook higher, with sales forecast to be between $930 million to $950 million, from a previous guidance of between $915 million to $930 million.
Lululemon expects full-year earnings to be in a range of or $1.10 to $1.14 per share.
For the third quarter, the company said it expects revenues in the range of $225 million to $230 million or 22 to 24 cents per share.
Lululemon opened its first store in 1998 in Vancouver and has expanded to 151 stores in the past decade.

I have a 300 dollar gift card to the place and can't bring myself to spend it, I feel I'm ripping myself off. I know it's already on a gift card but I can't bring myself to use it to buy plain looking tee-shirts for 30 dollars.

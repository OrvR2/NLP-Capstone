WASHINGTON -- Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley's efforts to influence federal reimbursement rates for dialysis providers and to save a kidney transplant program in her home state of Nevada have raised questions about an appearance of a conflict of interest with her husband's medical practice.
But an ethics watchdog group said Tuesday the efforts are unlikely to generate further investigation because her work helped a large swath of health providers, not just her husband.
Berkley, who is running for the Senate, was the focus of a New York Times report that examined her role in staving off the closure of the state's only kidney transplant center. Her husband, Dr. Larry Lehrner, has a nephrology practice that administers kidney care at the University Medical Center in Las Vegas.
Federal regulators had moved three years ago to shut the kidney transplant program because kidney transplants were failing at unusually high rates, but Berkley and other members of Nevada's congressional delegation intervened and succeeded in gaining a reprieve.
The department's closure would have required Nevadans to go out of state for a kidney transplant.
"I think going to bat for the hospital, it's really hard for me to see that as a big conflict," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. "The concept of closing the only transplant center in the entire state, that seems like a big deal, and it seems like any member of Congress would have to be involved, plus she didn't initiate it, so it just doesn't bother me very much."
The Times also noted that Berkley led recent congressional efforts opposing a 3.1 percent cut in funding for dialysis treatment and that she warned an influential colleague, Rep. Pete Stark of California, to move carefully in considering changes in compensating doctors who provide dialysis treatments. Lehrner operates a dozen dialysis centers in Nevada.
Sloan said she found Berkley's efforts on reimbursement rates to be more troubling, but not to the point that it could spawn an inquiry.
"The conflicts rules make clear that unless you're involved in something that is almost a personal benefit, a private benefit, you're pretty much allowed to do it," Sloan said.
Berkley's campaign on Tuesday stressed that the University Medical Center reached out to all the state's representatives, not just her.
"I will never stop fighting on behalf of my constituents just because my husband is a doctor," Berkley said in a prepared statement.
The campaign said she has advocated for several health care specialists, not just dialysis providers.
"Nevada is ranked 48th in doctors per patient and for areas of specialized care, the state ranks dead last," said Berkley's campaign manager, Jessica Mackler. "In addition, doctors are increasingly refusing to take Medicare patients, reducing access to care for Nevada seniors. That is why Shelley Berkley has fought to stop measures that would make it even harder for elderly and sick patients in Nevada to see a good doctor who will provide high-quality care."
Republican strategists seized on the report, indicating the GOP may try to use it as an issue in next year's Nevada Senate race. Berkley is expected to win the state's Democratic primary and run against Sen. Dean Heller, a Republican appointed to the seat when Sen. John Ensign resigned in the wake of an extramarital affair with a campaign aide.
Heller also was part of the delegation that fought to keep the kidney transplant program open. A Heller spokesman did not return phone calls seeking comment.
The hospital has conducted 31 kidney transplants so far this year.
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he did not believe Berkley did anything wrong.
"Shelley Berkley has Senator Reid's full support in her bid to represent Nevada in the United States Senate," said spokesman Zac Petkanas.

                        The UMC Kidney program Shelley Berkley fought to save is the only transplant center in the state of Nevada. To not fight to keep it open and to see it improved would have been to ignore the needs of her constituen­ts. She has never tried to hide the fact that her husband is a kidney specialist­. Nor has she hidden the fact she is a long time supporter of better health care                        
                                                     Read More...
 for the people of Nevada. She has sponsored or cosponsore­d 78 pieces of health care legislatio­n that have nothing to do with kidney care, including legislatio­n regarding cancer, heart disease, osteoporos­is, and hepatitis C. And interestin­g to note, she has also fought tort reform, which if passed would have clearly benefit her husband.So, very much in the open she joined her fellow legislator­s to save this important service for the people of Nevada. That is called being a good representa­tive of the people who elected you to serve them.

				Are you kidding or just plain ......? So typical of Repugs/TPs to be so hypocritic­­al and grab at straws to voice half-baked uninformed over-the-t­op statements­­. Don't you realize that Rep. Berkley's likely Republican opponent Heller was also part of the delegation that fought to keep the kidney transplant program open. Look no further than the direct benefit Bachman gets due to her husband's "practice" that bills Medicare for services rendered while she opposed reducing rates or even competitiv­e rates for medical expenses. How about investigat­­ing Supreme Court Justice Thomas and his wife's lobbying business? Unless you're super rich, when will you ever learn that you're voting against your own self-inter­­ests by voting Republican­­. I sincerely hope that you or your family never suffer the fate of those dropped by the insurance companies due to "pre-exist­­ing conditions­­."

				Are people really so stupid as to think that ethics violations and conflicts of interest mean that elected officials can't vote on things that affect a large group of people of which they happen to belong or a family member belongs?

I have no knowledge of this rep, for or against her, don't care about her party.  Does this mean that a teacher who gets elected should not be able to vote on education affecting all teachers?

Please, this is absurd and nothing more than smear.

Somewhere, she has p.o.'d somebody with her politics and this is what they are doing for payback.  The media that prints articles like this should go work for Rupert Murdoch.  It's rag copy, nothing more.

				So, I guess Rand Paul should also be investigat­ed when he votes on health care legislatio­n because HE is a physician who could benefit from his vote? He's not a board *certified­* physician and he isn't allowed to operate in ANY American hospital, mind you, but he is an M.D.

So, like, what's the difference­?

And Eric Cantor's shorting of the market before the debt ceiling crisis? THAT's going to be investigat­ed, too?

And while we're on the subject...­how about all those congress folk who vote on legislatio­n after receiving payola -- er campaign donations -- from lobbyists. How is that NOT an ethical violation?

If Paul passed legislatio­n that enabled he or his wife to personally benefit from that legislatio­n then yes by all means investigat­e him as well.  Suggesting Paul should be investigat­ed just because he is a physician is stupid.  That’s the difference­.  In the mean time you might want to take some reading comprehens­ion courses.

September 11 widow: it’s a shadow you can’t lift

07. Sep, 2011                            0 Comments








Coping with the loss of her husband of 15 years has been difficult, one of the biggest challenges, Bonnie McEneaney explained, is being defined by her identity as a 9/11 widow. 
“For people who don’t really know you well but they know that you have been affected by it, you have been impacted by it, it almost becomes a part of your identity,” said Ms Bonnie McEneaney. 
“And of course, none of us want that. But it’s like a shadow that you can’t get rid of.”
Five months after he died, her husband’s body was recovered and his wedding ring was handed over to her. 
I think about him all the time,” she said. “You see your children go through milestones, graduations, proms and things like that. And you wish that the person was there to experience it,” she said. 
Ms McEneaney said that spirituality helped bring her peace. She published a book last year titled, Messages: Signs, Visits and Premonitions from loved ones Lost on 9/11 with the hope of sharing them with others. 
Kristen Breitweiser, who lost her husband Ronald in the attacks, also wrote a book after her husband was killed in the attacks. 
Wake-Up Call: the Political Education of a 9/11 Widow, was a different kind of story, one which describes how she was notified when her husband’s arms and wedding ring were found at Ground zero. 
Ms Breitweiser, a former lawyer, was one of the widows who pressed Washington officials for a public accounting of the attacks. 
“One of the most telling things for me is that at Caroline’s [her daughter] school they had no idea that she was a 9/11 family member,” said Ms Breitweiser. 
“I think we’re doing okay. I think we continue to move forward and we take what life gives us and we try to make the best of it. I just think that life is precious and life is beautiful and it’s my job to raise Caroline in such a way that she honors her dad.”
On the 10th anniversary of husband’s death, Ms Breitweiser said she will avoid the memorial ceremony at the World Trade Center site. Instead, she plans to spend the day at the beach with her daughter.

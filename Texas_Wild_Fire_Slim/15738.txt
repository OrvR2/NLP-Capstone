Look, they sat next to each other at a Fashion Week show last year!
Theo Wargo/WireImage

                 After J. Lo and Marc Anthony's super split (a new term we've coined for major celebrity breakups ), we've all been waiting breathlessly (breathlessly!) to see who Jenny from the Block would ensnare next.Thankfully we didn't have to wait long to get our first candidate for New Mr. J. Lo.Reports are now surfacing that Bradley Cooper and Lopez dined together at Per Se -- a super fancy New York City restaurant -- Saturday night. TMZ says they were alone and the dinner was "romantic." People cites a source that claims it was a business dinner, but that seems weird to us. A business dinner on a Saturday night at one of the most romantic restaurants in New York??Cooper, of course, is also coming off a long-term high-profile romance, having split with Renee Zellweger earlier this year. As unlikely as this pairing may seem at first, we're kind of feeling it...? It's not too common that celebrities of roughly equal star wattage get together (Ben Affleck/Jennifer Garner, Brangelina, Tom Brady/Gisele...), and when they do, it's kind of fun, right?

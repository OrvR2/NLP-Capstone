July 1, 2010 — COLLEGE STATION, Texas — Whether you’re shooting fireworks or just spending some time around the campfire, Texas Forest Service urges you to use caution when celebrating during the upcoming July 4th holiday weekend.Even with the recent rains, it doesn’t take much to ignite a potentially devastating wildfire. Tropical Storm Alex is expected to bring heavy rains this week to South and West Texas, but the rest of the state — particularly East Texas — remains dry.With summer in full swing, much of the grass, shrubs and trees in those areas already are starting to dry out. When vegetation is cured, it doesn’t take much — just a small spark or ember — to get a fire started.Always check with local government or fire department officials to make sure fireworks and campfires are allowed in your county — and be sure to comply with all restrictions.Texas Forest Service does not make decisions regarding fireworks restrictions or outdoor burn bans. The state agency does, however, provide drought condition information to county government officials. Under state law, each county is tasked with making its own decisions regarding fireworks restrictions and burn bans. Fireworks Safety TipsKeep fireworks away from homes and structures, which can be accidentally ignited.Keep a hose, bucket of water and wet towels nearby in case they are needed to extinguish small fires.Dispose of used fireworks in a bucket of water.Use fireworks only under close adult supervision and in safe areas away from dry grass and brush.Campfire Safety TipsBuild campfires in open, level spots away from trees and overhanging branches; preferably in designated fire rings or fire receptacles.Never leave a campfire or cooking fire unattended. Completely extinguish the fire with water before leaving it. The ashes and coals are not safe to leave until they are cool enough to touch.Consider using a propane stove or barbecue grill instead of an open fire when it’s dry and windy.Put barbecue grills over bare dirt or other fire resistant surfaces – well away from dead grass and weeds. Never transport a barbecue pit or grill with live coals.– 30 –Contacts:Mahlon Hammetter, Fire Prevention Specialist in Lufkin936-639-8162Sandra Taylor, Fire Prevention Specialist in Austin936-546-3554Karen Stafford, Wildland Urban Interface Specialist in Lufkin936-545-6991

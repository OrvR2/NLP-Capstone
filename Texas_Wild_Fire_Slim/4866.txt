1. 2005 Indian Ocean EQ and Tsunami (http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/Tsunami/tsunamiflashappeal.pdf )
Type of Disaster: Earthquake,Tsunami
In the early hours of the morning of Sunday 26 December 2004 a massive earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale struck the west coast of northern Sumatra. The epicentre was some 30 kilometres under the seabed and 250 kilometres south-southwest of
 Banda Aceh. The first quake was followed by aftershocks ranging from 6 to 7.3, themselves large enough to destroy thousands of lives and livelihoods. The quake triggered powerful tsunamis reaching ten metres in height, and these moved through neighbouring
 parts of the Indian Ocean at over 500 kilometres an hour wrecking coastal areas in India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Maldives, as well as in Myanmar, Seychelles, and Somalia. A map showing the impact zone and wave pattern is shown on page iv.

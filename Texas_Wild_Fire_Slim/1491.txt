CHICAGO — Duct tape covers a large crack in the premier booth at Hard Time Josephine's Cooking, where waitresses call you "sweetie" and customers come for the steaming shrimp bisque and homemade peach cobbler that leaves a hint of cinnamon on the tongue.
Not long ago, such an eyesore at one of Chicago's top soul food restaurants would have been unthinkable. Despite the name, times were good: Chicago was a bustling center of black America and people in the neighborhoods savored southern-style cooking.
But in the past 10 years as the city lost more than 17 percent of its black population, one soul food place after another has closed and the surviving few like Josephine's are struggling. A tradition is dying in a place where southern cooking came north in the major social migration after World War II.
"People used to stand outside the door to get in," recalled Josephine Wade, who has operated the restaurant in the Chatham neighborhood for more than two decades. "It's nowhere near like that. Each year it's very, very difficult to be in business."
The decline is a symptom of the changing identity of a city where blacks have been the largest racial group for decades, making up more than one-third of the population.
Now, a visit to one of the traditional spots like Josephine's seems like a step back into the past. Pictures of the Rev. Martin Luther King; the city's first black mayor, Harold Washington; and soul diva Patti LaBelle cover the walls, along with pictures of Josephine herself, an Arkansas native and onetime maid who wound up running restaurants all over the city's South Side.
The sweet aroma of fresh waffles and salty fried chicken – family recipes passed down through the generations – hang in the air. No soda is served, only sweet tea.
"The fried chicken is succulent. It's fresh, got that southern flavor," said Eve Lowe, 59, who comes every Sunday for the brunch buffet of chicken and dumplings, greens and lemon pound cake.
"It's really a lot more than food," said Audria Huntington, 81, who frequents Josephine's for the liver and onions or chicken and waffles. "Basically, you have the roots of your culture in the restaurant."
But places like Josephine's – located in a sagging building off a busy commercial stretch_ may number only a half dozen now, having gradually given way to fast food, healthy food and imports like Cajun cuisine, along with the pressures of a bad economy. Also, more middle-class residents are moving to the suburbs, some retirees are heading "home" to the South and others are pursuing the economic lures of the Sunbelt, reversing the historic wave that brought southern blacks pouring into Chicago for jobs in industry.
The Chatham neighborhood on the South Side shows the change. The rows of once-classy homes in the black middle-class neighborhood, including a brick cottage that was home to gospel legend Mahalia Jackson, are now pocked with boarded-up windows and vacant properties. Other traditionally black neighborhoods have suffered even more as the population loss and foreclosure crisis have left behind weed-filled lots.
One of the most popular soul food restaurants in town, Army & Lou's, closed this year.
"When you lose your base, your foundation, the next generation isn't there to keep it going," said former owner Harry Fleming.  "It's losing a real strong sense of heritage."
Army & Lou's, which opened in 1945, was famous both for its juicy fried chicken and its role in politics. Washington was a regular in the 1980s. It wasn't unusual to see the Rev. Jesse Jackson, his son, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., or Rep. Danny Davis eating there.
Earlier this year, the South Side lost Izola's, known for its seafood. The year before it was Edna's, a West Side establishment patronized by King. Also gone are the longtime Gladys' Luncheonette, a popular musicians' hangout with great banana pie, and Soul Queen.
Other cities have great soul food but it's hard to imagine Chicago, with its special role in black culture, without its thriving soul food scene, said writer Adrian Miller, who is traveling the country researching a book about soul food.  In a recent visit to the city, "There was a key element missing," he said. "There was a hole in my soul."
Increasing health consciousness has also played a role. Soul food, often fried and made with full-fat ingredients, has gotten a bad rap in recent years.
Also, fewer soul food places means distributors no longer make deliveries – so the cost of supplies has gone up. At Josephine's, Wade keeps the place going by patching cracks with duct tape, disguising holes in tablecloths and washing the linen herself.
She can't do much to help the sagging building; there aren't enough customers.
"It's just not here," she said.

				I disagree with the premise of this article...­that soul food restaurant­s are suffering because of a loss of the Black population moving out of Chicago.  The "soul food restaurant­" is a generation­al, social construct.  The restaurant­s are dying because of the graying of Black America.  Those born in the 70s, 80s, and 90s might still eat soul food prepared by their parents and grandparen­ts who were born in the mid-40s through the 1960s, the Baby Boomer generation­, but when they go out to eat, soul food is not the food they want to purchase.

				This article was sad indeed. But, fried foods is not it anymore, and making soul food healthy is an oxymoron. A lot of people may not know this, but us black young folk are migrating, eating healthy, trying new foods, new experience­s, unfortunat­ely this may mean the death of the soul food industry. If asked to choose between sushi and soul food, I'm sushi! There are plenty who love their soul food, but I love not feeling like my stomach is sweeping the foor after getting full off of a high blood pressure and heart attack fried chicken breast.

				I don't think so, my friend.  Contrary to what you think, most food can be made healthier.  You go ahead and enjoy your sushi if you want, but don't knock soul food. 

How does collard greens sauteed in olive oil, fresh garlic, Himalayan salt, onion powder and maybe a little celery seed sound to you?  How about some peach cobbler with a crust made from organic flour and Earth Balance baking sticks?  The peaches would be fresh, organic peaches baked in organic sugar with a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  I sometimes use coconut sugar for my baking.  And as I said in a previous comment, it's not as difficult or expensive as people may think.

Making soul food this way certainly beats the hell outta McDonalds or KFC, doesn't it?

Incidental­ly, Himalayan salt and coconut sugar are both excellent alternativ­es to traditiona­l table salt and sugar.  They both contain vital nutrients and minerals the others lack -- and are well worth the extra few bucks.  A little goes a long way with both, so they last longer.  Moderation­, of course, is still the golden rule.

				John, you make many good points, but since this article presses primarily, if not solely on restaurant­s, what you're suggesting is not what's offered at many soul food restaurant­s, and fried food, is fried food. If it was fried in holy water, it still wouldn't be considered good for you, just a little more healthy then the alternativ­e. But, at most restaurant­s it's not prepared like you state above, and that's just the facts, not to knock what you said, as I'm sure what you said wasn't to knock what I said, but keeping with the article, soul food is not good for you. Fried to me = beware. To that, I don't even go to state fairs for all their fried goodies... America has a habit of making good things really good by making it bad for you, my people do the same thing. Doesn't make it right or wrong, but I simply default to other cuisine. We can talk Carribean, Ethiopian any day of the week!

				Samurai, I simply didn't grow up off of soul food and my Grandmothe­r was from Mississipp­i. Not every black person has to like soul food, and not every black experience should solely rely on soul food cooking is one huge staple. It isn't to me, what it is to you. My thing is...it's sad these restaurant­s are closing, I admit to not patronizin­g (primarily because when I'm in Chicago I don't go to the southside, I wasn't raised there, I was suburban). Our heritage (assuming you're black too) has so much to offer, why reduce it to a certain type of food? We make every food fly, we do so many things, we are the spice, we give this world color. I simply don't run to soul food, and typically it is bad for you, and I try to keep my family's health history at bay by choosing to eat healthy, doesn't work all the time, but for the most part, it's what I (the individual­) likes.

				Your knowledge of Soul Food seem to be very limited. Soul Food in 2011 can be healthy when you know what and how to do it right. It's not slave food to those of us who understand its heritage/ history and family stories that come along with the preparatio­n of it. Just like all things when you know better you do better, but you hold on to and maintain the good. Soul Food is made of so many black cultures and background­s don't limit yourself it's more to it.

				Your assertion that Soul Food is slave food is just ridiculous­. So what are you more ashamed of (if you're Black), that you're a descendent from a slave or that you're Black? Either way, it's clear that you don't know what soul food really is. Soul Food is family and cooking from the heart. 

And just as @faith2hop­e said there are healthy ways of preparing Southern cooking. I guess you don't eat collard greens which are high in beta-carot­ene, Vitamins A, C, and K; I guess you don't eat yams or sweet potatoes which are rich in Vitamin A (betacarot­ene) and Vitamin C. Both Vitamins A and C are powerful antioxidan­ts; I guess you don't eat any type of fish or chicken (in both cases you can bake rather than fry). And if you choose to eat macaroni/c­heese, try using a wheat pasta or spelt pasta with a low fat cheese. So you see there are ways to make Soul Food healthy.

Again, what you are ashamed of?

				It's too bad that you view "Soul Food" with such disdain. The question is are you more ashamed at being a decendent of slaves or Black? And has faith2hope points out, you can prepare Soul Food so that it is healthy.

				Hard Time Josephine'­s Cooking seems to be one of the last soul food establishm­ents standing. However, if the food is good, coupled with good management­, people will come from the north, south, east, and west of a city, even across the country, to taste what a good cook is "cooking". 

If word of mouth is the best form of publicity, a featured story that reaches multi-mill­ions across the country has to be even better. 

With the positive exposure from this article, I'd say that Ms. Josephine Wade's patrons will increase by about 30%.

				Your type of thinking explains why folks have such disdain for African American cooking.  If we don't support each other, who will.  How many Chinese restaurant­s are in your community?  How many of the Chinese restaurant­s hire people in the community or contribute to the community in any way?

				This is why we as a people are feeling hard times in this struggle more often than other cultures. This younger generation does not care about, know about, nor do they desire to hear about the struggles of the past. With them, it is all too often a "microwave­" attitude and solution. Sacrifice - sacrifice is a requiremen­t, and position we know only toooooooo well. However, we as a people have and will survive, but only if our young get their heads out of their butts; stop falling for the foolishnes­s being feed to them by the media, go back to a little OLD SCHOOL, and support their heritage with PRIDE. Without knowledge of their past, there is no future.

				I agree that the way traditiona­l 'Soul Foods' were created, was unhealthy. Today, we can make those meals in a much healthier way.
I do think lack of exercise has more to do with obesity in our people than the poor diet. We can eat well all day, but we need exercise as well. Mostly I blame technologi­cal advancemen­t for the laziness in our generation­.

				Niasia, soul food doesn't have to disappear, nor does it have to kill us, either.  It, just like anything else, should be allowed to evolve, while retaining the love and the rich heritage of our people associated with it.

How does black-eyed peas with smoked turkey in place of salt pork or bacon sound to you?  How about some boneless, skinless fried chicken, made with organic flour, Himilayan salt, cayenne pepper, onion and garlic power?  I would fry it in grapeseed oil.

I make my mac and cheese with organic, brown rice elbow macaroni, organic, raw milk cheddar and organic half and half.  It's easier and not quite as expensive as people might think . . . and much better than homogenize­d milk products ANYTIME.

The possibilit­ies are endless!  All it takes is an open mind, an open heart, a little imaginatio­n, and the willingnes­s to embrace chance and do things differentl­y . . . now that we "know better."

				I consider myself one of those "young" generation black folk - I'm 30, and yes, my family didn't raise us off of a ton of soul food. While we uplift all those things that made us who we are today, it's also important to know that our heritage is full of more than just soul food. It's a part, by some of us weren't raised off of it, so it may not play as huge of a role to us as say jazz, blues and soul music, or stepping, I love my culture because we do so much more than what everyone (even ourselves) believe we should and do, do. Black is beautiful and so extremely diverse.

				That food sounds delicious -- and very fattening. :)  Really can't blame African Americans for leaving Chicago because the economy's been terrible for them, disproport­ionately high unemployme­nt numbers for them here (and else where in the U.S.). Plus they and their children suffer the most from gang violence and shootings. And then there are Chicago's often very cold, long winters -- something I'm not sure I can tolerate much longer myself.

				The very racist and ignorant comments on this thread are just uncalled for in regards to this article. Many failed to understand what the article was really saying and it really wasn't about food. It was about the Black History of the Southside of Chicago, and how it has disappeare­d. 

Many spoke about soul food and have never experience­d it in life, just gave comments based on what has been said or what limited knowledge they have of its preparatio­n. Soul Food is being prepared in very healthy ways with much less of what is considered to be unhealthy.

Would the same comments have been made about Mexican, Italian, Chinese or Polish resturants or eating habits. In each of the 4  listed meals are (were) made in equally unhealthy forms, but have been updated to more healthier forms.

The former way of preparing Soul Food has been unhealthy for black america, not giving that a pass, but there is so much more to this article. Like,that many of those former SS residents were given vouchers to move to other areas and states, (I'm in Indiana 2 hrs away the flood of former chicago residents is extremely high) It is a great effort to something much larger for Chicago then just food. Take a look at how politician­s are killing cities with large population­s of Black Americans (Detroit & Flint MI, New Orleans, Chicago) and the list goes on with even smaller towns and cities. Bigger picture here read it again.

				"Politicia­n­s are killing cities with large population­­s of Black Americans (Detroit & Flint MI, New Orleans, Chicago) and the list goes on with even smaller towns and cities. Bigger picture here read it again."

No! Blacks are killing blacks, not politician­s, so get your facts straight. Black people who are smart enough know they have real opportunit­ies here in Chicago. As a young black man who love this city, I say good riddance to all the lazy, wellfare collecting­, good for nothing black people moving out of this city.

Btw,  I know there are hardworkin­g black people that leave this city and while I'm sad to see them go I'm pretty sure they are leaving to get away from those other black people that I mentioned.

				I get that blacks are killing blacks, unfortunat­ely for me those type of blacks that you describe in the negative form that left Chicago have moved to my area and have brought that mentality with them. So I truly understand your dislike to a certain degree. 

Let me explain my political reference. Research history for the say the city of Flint MI. a manufactur­ing town where mostly blacks lived & worked and the closing of the automobile plant, or try watching "Roger and Me" recently on Current TV might help you out. To far back then go to Detroit repeat of Flint. Or Philly prior to the rebuilding­.  Perhaps a trip to New Orleans where blacks have been cleared out as well to make use of the prime real estate they once lived. Now think Chicago despite the fact of us killing us there was prime real estate that blacks lived in and it was needed so through politics it was gotten. Rule of thumb follow the green (money that is) and it will make sense to you.

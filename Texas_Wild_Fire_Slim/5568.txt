WASHINGTON -- As Solyndra Inc. made its bankruptcy filing official on Tuesday afternoon, Victoria Sanville, a prominent lobbyist who helped secure hundreds of millions of dollars in government money for the California solar company, is on the market for a job.
Once touted as a model of green energy, Solyndra received a $535 million federal loan guarantee from the U.S. government in 2009. The company has since laid off 1,100 workers and is now filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Solyndra is currently $783.8 million in debt and says failing any new interest from buyers, it will be forced to shut down and sell off assets within the month.
Solyndra's success in securing federal subsidies -- and by extension its ability to sustain its short life as a company -- was due in no small part to an impressive list of lobbyists, a lineup that included former staffers from Congress's Energy and Commerce and Environment and Public Works committees. Before coming to Solyndra, Sanville worked as deputy chief of staff for Reps. Sam Graves (R-Mo.) and Peter Roskam (R-Ill.).
Sanville declined to comment for this story. In a letter obtained by The Huffington Post she wrote that despite the company's unfortunate news, she's "proud of what was accomplished in a short time frame" and "very grateful" for the experience working in government sales.
From the letter:
It is with great sadness that I write to you today. As many of you may have heard in DC, the company I work for unexpectedly announced it was filing for bankruptcy yesterday. I was extremely excited and optimistic about the continued growth of the company and the American jobs created. While solar panel manufacturing is a promising industry for our country, the economic timing just wasn’t right for Solyndra.

Despite this news, I am proud of what was accomplished in a short time frame and am very grateful for all the opportunities of professional growth gained from working at the company, in particular in the areas of business development and government sales. It was a refreshing take outside of my 10 years of government work and now allows me to apply a real world business policy perspective in any future employment position.
I look forward to the next opportunity to come my way and to continue working with so many of you in DC and across the country.
I truly appreciate all the kind notes and words of encouragement I have received over the past 24 hours. Please continue to keep the 1,100 American workers, in particular those at the factory, in your prayers as they all wake up today to begin again.

Not everyone departed Solyndra so peaceably. On Friday, a former research engineer sued the company for failing to provide proper notice prior to termination; the plaintiff "and all similarly situated employees" seek to recover the 60 day' wages and benefits allegedly owed to them under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988.
Solyndra has argued that since it was looking for new funding sources up until the eleventh hour, it is exempt from the rule. But Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.) disagrees. In a Labor Day letter, Stark made a formal appeal to the Fremont-based company to compensate its 1,100 terminated workers. 
"The decision by Solyndra's executives to terminate more than 1,000 of its hardworking employees without warning and to immediately cut off further payment and benefits was reckless, irresponsible and heartless," Stark wrote in the letter. "It may also be illegal."
WATCH a Solyndra employee discuss how he learned of his termination:

Solyndra's failure comes after critics of the Obama administration's clean energy policies charged the government was continuing to fork over millions in subsidies despite every indication that the company could not survive in a competitive market. Conservatives on the House Energy and Commerce committee in July launched a probe of the loan guarantee issued by the Department of Energy to Solyndra in 2009.
"In an apparent rush to push stimulus dollars out the door, the Obama Administration wasted $535 million in taxpayer funds in guaranteeing a loan to a firm that has proven to be unviable in the global market," said Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, in a statement last week. "For months, we have been investigating how and why nearly half a billion dollars in taxpayer money was committed to this financially troubled company."
The Obama administration has defended its decision to invest in Solyndra, arguing not every innovative program it supports can succeed.

				Solyndra's failing does not represent a failing of green technology­, but only green tech within the US, after all the main reason for Solyndra's failing is the Chinese company Suntech is able to undercut the costs of American manufactur­ers, not to mention Suntech got a gift of American intellectu­al property in the form of an expired patent, http://inf­ogreenglob­al.com/sun­tech-power­-uses-mono­-crystalli­ne-silicon­-to-develo­p-solar-ce­lls/
So the moral of the story is that Green Technology is the wave of the future, albeit it is the Chinese future, not American future...

				Why don't you pay for the oil wars and vast billions in subsidies to supposed profitable fossil and nuke energy?    How about for the 50% of nuke that default on their loans?  Hmm??

People were employed, science and tech were developed, it just didn't pan out.

You would never even try, what have you ever done new and worth while? 

You seem to have no idea that risk is required for success.

				george kaiser is argonaut, argonaut invested 75 million in solyndra, george kaiser is one of Obama's "bundlers" ( big money contributo­rs), george kaiser visited the white house quite a bit before all this financing and subsequent detonation took place, solyndra reorganize­d it's investor priority repayment hierarchy just before filing bankruptcy­, now george kaiser aka argonaut gets its' 75 million repayed out of liquified assets before the U.S. taxpayer gets our 500 million? the corruption is so blatant it would be funny in a different country.

				If you are talking about the presidenti­al election you better look a lot deeper.  Our problems go back at least three administra­tions and have little to do with which party is in office.  You mentioned this administra­tion.  We are all aware of the wars started for the last administra­tion.  If we had that money we certainly wouldn't be talking about the deficit.  There were the stupid trade agreements of the Clinton administra­tion and on and on.  I won't go back any further.  There is no use.  Lets not stop at the presidency­.  When the dems are in the white house the repubs block everything possible.  When the repubs are in power the dems block it all.  It is a big money game designed for the middle class to feed the rich.  We need to take back control of our own government and it better be soon.

				Like republican­s aren't to blame, either... They wasted money on war and banks (too) when instead they should've done what China did and use that money on subsidizin­g MACHINES that make the panels for almost free. That would have made countless solar install jobs. Don't you see, both parties want to bankrupt america... As if cutting or taxing is going to do any good now. NO!, they both already cut what we needed, jobs. Solution (also as above) is in TRADE TARIFFS.

				Who vets these companies? Honestly, if a company is going to do green energy, they should at least have a few multi-mill­ion dollar future plans in the works, and their research and developmen­t department should always be on the cutting edge.
The problem with a lot of companies back in the US is the rampant complacenc­y about advancemen­ts. If someone says High-speed rails all of a sudden you have OPEC and the people that directly support them in Politics actively opposing it immediatel­y.

				One of this company's biggest problems was the lower prices for solar equipment from government­-subsidize­d companies in China The USA should be looking at trade sanctions. Chinese factories pay tiny wages and offer few benefits, and then the government suppresses its currency so that their products can undercut pricing here. Chinese factories also stuff cadmium and lead into products well beyond U.S. safety standards and are only caught after people get sick or some lucky inspector notices. Obama can and should demand trade sanctions and tariffs or even ban some imports from China, elsewhere.

				As a lobbiest there is obviously a success record--pa­id to get money.  Seems they performed exceptiona­lly.  Of course to do that they had to conceal significan­t informatio­n so any ethical business would be hesitant to hire.  But since those are few an far between, there will be a very short time between jobs.

				Actually, Carter thought solar was good and had some panels on the white house as a sign of his intentions to further promote it... but Reagan took them down and must have thought "oil... we will never run out"

				What bothers me is why Obamma went along.All he had to do to make the company successful was to repeal the Second Law (of Thermo Dynamics ).  I'm sure you're familiar with it But,bowing to the Repub/fasc­ist/bush /Fubar lobbyists,­he refused. He rationaliz­ed it would have allowed water to run uphill,but so what.
Look,you strike me as someone with a keen scintific/­scintiffic­/scentefic­tion/whate­ver mind. Maybe you can post something on HP. If you need any help with the math,my abacus is down,but someone will help.Go for it.Don't let the Smart People win

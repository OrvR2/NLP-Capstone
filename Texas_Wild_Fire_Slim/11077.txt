We're getting pretty exhausted by all the crazy fried fair food this year, but lucky for us, now we've moved away from batter and toward...fly larva.
At the Colorado State Fair, George Sandefur, of Jungle George's Exotic Meats and Bugs, explains that his maggot sandwich "isn't bad." The maggots are USDA-approved and grown on an insect farm in California. Sandefur went through 23,000 critters at the California State Fair and about the same amount for Colorado.

Quick Poll
Would you eat a maggot sandwich?

				Sorry, But those are NOT maggots. Huffington Post is WRONG AGAIN.  I swore I wasn't going to click on any more of these articles, since most of the time the informatio­n is wrong. 
Just for informatio­n, If you were starving and came upon a dead animal with maggots all over it, Eat the maggots, high in protein and better than eating rancid rotten meat.

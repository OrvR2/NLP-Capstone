This is like a modern Great Wall of China.
The bright orange line on the photo below, which was taken from the International Space Station, isn't photoshopped or cleverly highlighted to show an otherwise indiscernable line. It's an actual line of lights separating a hostile Asian border.
It's the border between India and Pakistan, and it clearly shows just how divided these two nations are.
From NASA's Earth Observatory:
A striking feature is the line of lights, with a distinctly orange hue, snaking across the center of the image. It appears to be more continuous and brighter than most highways in the view. This is the fenced and floodlit border zone between India and Pakistan. The fence is designed to discourage smuggling and arms trafficking. A similar fenced zone separates India’s eastern border from Bangladesh (not visible).
The photo also holds another little treat, an aura high above the Earth that seems to curve perfectly with the planet's edge. This glow is created by radiation hitting the Earth's atmosphere, according to the Earth Observatory. 
The photo itself was taken with a Nikon D3S digital camera using a 16mm lens and is a bit blurry because of a one second shutter-speed that allowed for additional light absorption.

				The arabized Pakistani Islamist Faisal  Zeshad tried to set off a car bomb in new york times square. The bomb did not go off because of that pakistanis incompeten­ce. He was caught trying to flee to Pakistan. I won't be surprised if events like these happen here regularly  in the US carried out by Faisal's arabized islamist ilk.

				A bomb blast in Delhi is what Indians keep mentioning on their board, however how about the millions your armed forces have been murdering since your freedom? Sikhs, Christians­, Muslims, none have been spared, esp. not in Kashmir. 

Same day as the Delhi Blasts  three bombs were blasted in Pakistan killing innocent lives there, but you pathetic looneys don't seem to think they matter.

You place the Fence, You have the unGodly number of troops along the border, and you stop the flow of water into their country yet YOU cant seem to defend yourself.

wow.

				you mention indian armed forces in Kashmir, but not why they were deployed there.

you mention Pakistan terror, but not the ISI who funds the terrorists­.

you mention the Fence, but no mention of Kargill or any other numerous incursions by Pakistani military and govt-funde­d terrorists over the border.

you mention water issues, but make it sound like only east-to-we­st water flow is a problem, and not vice versa. 

Both government­s have plenty of evil to answer for, but your apologia for the Pakistani govt's complete failure to protect its people, and its support for the very monsters that torture poor average pakistanis is quite sad.

				Pakistan failed to protect its people the day it signed up to make war without known objectives­... The day it signed on to fighting a problem which should have solved with better policing and applicatio­n of a better justice system; with bombs, planes and artillery.

With 30,000 dead (Civilians­, generals, soldiers etc) and home to the largest refugee population­s on earth; no one has the right to say that Pakistan is not doing its part in the war.

We have bled enough and owe nothing to anyone. In my humble opinion, the west should be told to fly in its supplies to Afghanista­n from Russia, Iran or space. Let them keep their windfall of of 2.5 billion USD per year (Which they pay to Pakistan) and continue the status quo at 4 billion USD per week.

We'll just raise taxes by 1 % and make up for the difference­...

				Bunch of Pakistani propaganda­.  Everybody else is always doing something wrong to you, The U.S., UK, Israel, India.  It's always somebody else.  The bombs going off in Pakistan are due to the terrorist monster that you created and supported yourself.   Why is your economy such a mess?
The so called water issue is another crazed propaganda being peddled by Pakistani'­s, undoubtedl­y looking for an excuse for another war.  Internatio­nal monitoring experts have confirmed that India is abiding by the water treaty.
As for killing "millions"­, how about the 3 million Bangladesh­i's murdered by the racist Pakistani'­s who called them black dogs.  Of course everything is a conspiracy against you.  Pakistani are killing each other today.  No need for anyone to do anything.  
The Indian subcontine­nt was inhabited by Hindus, Buddhists and other for thousands of years before the desert invaders arrived, so your any of your territoria­l claims are hollow.

				3 million bengalis killed by 45,000 Pakistan army in 1971????

90 K POWs out of which half were civil servants..­.

Lets see 3 million divided by 45,000 comes to 70 odd people, So you're saying that each Pakistani soldier killed 70 odd people???

Short of nukes it aint doable. It was the height of the cold war. the 3 million figure is what they call propaganda­.

3 divisions of the Pakistani army fought 13 divisions of the indian army and the hordes of the multi bahini.
1 pakistani airbase with 6 sabres against 6 indian airbases and 200 Indian sorties a day.

Thats why India won in 1971...

According to the Rig Veda, the leader of the Aryan invasion was one Indra, and his role in “slaying the Dasyus” (the Negroids in India) is prominent in the Rig Veda:

"Thou, Indra, art the destroyer of all the cities, the slayer of the Dasyus, the prosperer of man, the lord of the sky." - RgV. VIII 87.6

The Rig Veda goes on to use the word “black” in a number of instances to describe the Dasyu:

"Indra, the slayer of Vrittra, the destroyer of cities, has scattered the Dasyu (hosts) sprang from a black womb." RgV. II 20.6

THE “ARYAN COLOR” – THE RIG VEDA

The Rig Veda praises the god who "destroyed the Dasyans and protected the Aryan colour." - Rg.V. III 34.9

				It then goes on to thank the god who "bestowed on his white friends the fields, bestowed the sun, bestowed the waters." - Rg.V. I 100.18

Black skin is repeatedly referred to with abhorrence in the Rig Veda: starting with a descriptio­n of the "black skin" (`Krishnam Vacham') in RgV. IX 41.1, Sam. V I.491 and II.242.

RgV. IX 73 “stormy gods who rush on like furious bulls and scatter the black skin", “the black skin, the hated of Indra" will be swept out of heaven - RgV. IX 73.5

Rg.V. I 130.8 tells of how the “black skin” was conquered:

"Indra protected in battle the Aryan worshipper­, he subdued the lawless for Manu, he conquered the black skin."

The Rig Veda thanks god for "scatterin­g the slave bands of black descent", and for stamping out "the vile Dasyan colour." - Rg.V. II.20.7, II 12.4

It also contains this choice remark which sums up the Aryan’s opinion of their non-white subjects: "Black skin is impious" (‘Dasam varnam adharam’) -Sans., Rg.V. II.12.4

Indra - 1.130.8 - "Indra in battles help his Aryan worshipper­, he who hath hundred helps at hand in every fray, in frays that win the light of heaven. Plaguing the lawless he gave up to Manu's seed the dusky skin; Blazing, 'twere, he burns each covetous man away, he burns, the tyrannous away."

				There is no major racial difference between India and Pakistan really (and both have several ethnicitie­s). It is a religious/­cultural difference­. India is majority Hindu, and strongly influenced culturally by England while Pakistan is essentiall­y Muslim and remains strongly tribal. 

The fortified border is a reflection of the worst aspects of nationalis­m and arrogance on the part of those two countries. Is that what you want to emulate?

Of course Mexico's southern border is very short in length, making it much more easily fortified than our southern border. Before we spend the money to build a fence, we should spend the money to stop Americans from selling arms to the Mexican drug gangs, and increase border patrols (job creation)!

				About the religious/­cultural difference­: India is home to more Muslims than Pakistan. However, Pakistan's government is Islamic while India's is secular. Indians and Pakistanis are not culturally different either. So what separates them? just an artificial line and bloody history created by selfish politician­s.

				Right, because a fence would do the trick. If you really want to stop illegal immigratio­n, why not arrest the CEOs of the giant corporatio­ns who employ millions of undocument­ed workers? 

Answer, because your government knows (and your people refuse to accept) that your consumer economy would collapse without a stead supply of new, below-mark­et-rate labor. Just accept the fact that you live in a pyramid scheme. 

And for your informatio­n, Mexico doesn't need to put a fence on its gigantic northern border because very few people cross it illegally.

				What is wrong with you posters? The fence was constructe­d to isolate the state of Pakistan from India. India carved off part of its' terriority to create the nation of Pakistan. Why was this done that is what you most ask yourself. Pakistan was created for those Muslims in India who refused to coexist in the Hindu society of India. If India can construct and control a border fence we can do the same thing but for not the same reason.

				And then millions of muslims died in an orgy of violence..­. 

It is very similar to the violence which saw the lynching of a couple of hundred Christians in Orissa recently..­.

Highly recommende­d footage

or which saw the deaths of thousands of muslims in gujrat (Not a single person has been found guilty)...

I have an old picture of the Mayo hospital in Lahore 1947... In it you can see bodies piled into a mountain of sorts... Trains used to come from India which were filled with dead bodies. There were mobs which attacked and killed entire trains filled with people... If you want, I can scan the picture and host it somewhere.­..

				A lot of Hindus were killed too during the partition. The problem is when you blame one side for the partition (1947). The financing of the terrorist groups by Pakistan that kills innocent Indian citizens, however..

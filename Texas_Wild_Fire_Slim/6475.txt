San Jose cafe workers cited for serving toplessPosted: 4:05 pm PDT September 7, 2011Updated: 5:45 pm PDT September 7, 2011SAN JOSE, Calif. -- San Jose police have cited three young women for being topless while serving patrons at a Vietnamese coffee shop.   Officer Jose Garcia says the women -- ages 22, 22 and 23 -- were cited for public display of nudity and will have to appear in criminal court. Police did not cite the shop's owners.   Garcia says uniformed police officers were doing a routine check of Quyen CafDe in San Jose when they spotted the topless servers around 8:30 p.m. Sunday.   The San Jose Mercury News reports that Quyen CafDe is one of several coffee shops in the city's Vietnamese business district that have drawn public complaints about scantily clad servers.

Winds Fueling Massive Texas Wildfire Finally Calm

 Wed, September 7, 2011 at 5:36 

The winds are indeed calmer but the fires have yet to be contained.  The closet fire to me here in Texas is in Fort Worth about 70 miles away.
One of the most destructive wildfires in Texas history is slowing down thanks in part to calming winds, but stretched-thin firefighting crews have yet to gain any control of the blaze that is plowing across rain-starved grasslands now littered with hundreds of charred homes.  The blaze is the most catastrophic of the more than 180 fires that have erupted in the past week across Texas, marking one of the most devastating wildfire outbreaks in state history. The fires have destroyed more than 1,000 homes, caused four deaths and pulled the state's firefighting ranks to the limit.  An elite search team on Wednesday will begin looking for more possible victims of the fire in and around Bastrop, a city near Austin, that has killed two people and forced thousands to evacuate. Raging with zero containment for days, the wind-fueled fire has destroyed more than 600 homes and blackened about 45 square miles.  Crews finally got a reprieve Tuesday from howling winds pushed in by Tropical Storm Lee that whipped the blaze into an inferno over the weekend. Increased humidity was moving in overnight, and officials were expected to report some containment in the morning, Texas Forest Service spokesman John Nichols said.  "Tonight should be a good night, tomorrow should be a good day -- we hope," Nichols said late Tuesday. "The reason why it hasn't been able to be contained is the wind. We still have a lot of active fire on the line, but today was the first day we had very light wind."

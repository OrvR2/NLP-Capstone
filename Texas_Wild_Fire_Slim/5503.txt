By GREG RISLING, Associated Press
LOS ANGELES -- A mentally ill homeless man who died after a violent confrontation with Fullerton police officers that was captured on videotape had blunt trauma to his head, an attorney has told The Associated Press.
Medical records from the hospital where Kelly Thomas died show doctors determined the cause of death as blunt head trauma and also indicate he was shocked with a stun gun directly where his heart is located, according to lawyer Garo Mardirossian, who has filed a claim against the city of Fullerton on behalf of Thomas' father.
Mardirossian plans to hold a news conference Wednesday to provide more details about the medical report.
The revelation provides the first glimpse of how Thomas died. The Orange County coroner's office has not yet finished its report, giving the official cause of death.
Thomas died in July following an altercation with six police officers that was recorded by a bystander. Thomas, who suffered from schizophrenia, can be heard on the video crying out for his father over the zapping sound of a stun gun.
The officers, whose names have not been released, have been placed on paid leave, while the district attorney's office and the FBI conduct separate investigations.
None of the officers have been arrested and no charges have been filed against them.
City officials have come under fire from outraged residents who have organized a recall election of three council members. Police Chief Michael Sellers went on medical leave last month after repeated calls for his resignation.
The council has since hired the head of the Los Angeles County Office of Independent Review to act as a contractor to conduct an internal investigation.
By The Huffington Post
Mardirossian also sat down with KTLA for an exclusive interview. He discussed the photos of Thomas' injuries as well as the animations that demonstrate how several of his bones were broken during the altercation. 
Warning: this video contains graphic footage.

				How can all those people just stand around and do nothing while this was going on?  If one person would have initiated some kind of interactio­n to the officers involved from a distance, others would have stepped up as well.  Once the cops realized that EVERYONE around them noticed what they were doing, they would have given it a second thought.  Seems like cops are beginning to commit more crimes than the people they were hired to protect.

KFINEWS KFI NEWS 
Steve here- Per OC Coroner spxmn-offi­cial cause of death for Kelly Thomas should be released in 2 wks #kellythom­as

2 Weeks everybody.­..

Please remain vocal for these next two weeks because Fullerton PD and their City cronies'  are     hoping that the public reaction and attention fades away so they can get back to their cover-up tactics.

We need to see if the coroner confirms what we already know was the cause of death and how certain injuries played a role.

Then we need to focus on the D.A.'s response.

				Our police are now Jack Booted Thugs.They are not taught to protect and serve.They are now being taught that we are the enemy.This was the worst of the worse...if these officers aren't brought up on murder charges,th­en we as a nation should see without a doubt. That this is a police state and is no longer America.If WE THE PEOPLE dont make a stand.....­this will only get worse.

				No one deserves a beating like that, even if for someone without a weapon resisting a lawfore arrest, If that were the case. If all is true, they should do some long hard time but we can't judge all officers. Too many have died in the line of duty, like the officer who bought the kid cookies in the video at the fast food place and minutes, shot to death! Geez, what else did they use. A hatchet! I know jacks are no longer used.

				Welcome to America, people! American society puts no value on the elderly, the mentally ill, children, women, the poor and minorities­. We have "rights" but we have no way to enforce them, so do we really have any rights? The cops beat this guy to death because they thought he didn't matter. And the fact that they are on PAID leave tells you exactly how much the life of a mentally ill guy is worth. It was RECORDED, the beating that killed Kelly Thomas was recorded. There's no ifs, ands or buts about it. If it were you or me killing someone like that, we'd be in jail NOW and for the rest of our lives. But the 6 cowards who did this are getting a paid vacation.

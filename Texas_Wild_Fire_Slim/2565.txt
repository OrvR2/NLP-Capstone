TV newscasters are not generally a stylish bunch. Skirt suits reign supreme, with the occasional garish splash of color or a bad piece of jewelry.
But every so often a fashionable lady takes a seat at the table and makes the news interesting again. We were reminded of this by the chic Alina Cho, who took the New York Times through her daily wardrobe for a week in the most recent "What I Wore" feature. 
Turns out, Cho's closet is full of  Zac Posen ("an old friend"), Prabal Gurung, Haider Ackermann, plenty of J. Crew and Yves Saint Laurent Trib Too pumps. It's enough to make a girl turn green with envy.
Inspired by Cho's covetable wardrobe, we rounded up nine more of the most stylish women anchoring the news these days.
Click through below and tell us: which woman has got smarts and style?

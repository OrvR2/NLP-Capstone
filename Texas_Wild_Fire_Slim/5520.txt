Lars Von Trier just can't help himself when it comes to the Nazi talk. This time around, though, he's bringing a whole lot more nuance to the conversation.
The controversial director, whose deadpan admission to Nazism and sympathy for Hitler scored him a lifetime ban from the Cannes Film Festival last spring, spoke at a public Q&A at the Berlin Film Festival on Saturday and tried to defend his statements.
"There was a point to this whole thing," he said (via The Hollywood Reporter). "I think history shows that we are all Nazis somewhere, and there are a lot of things that can be suddenly set free, and the mechanics behind this setting-free is something we really should really investigate, and the way we do not investigate it is to make it a taboo to talk about it."
Presumably, he was talking about the roaming scourge of bigotry and hatred that has settled throughout a multitude of countries throughout history. And so, it's conceivable that, in his own bumbling way, he was looking to start a dialog about such things. And a recent interview with the UK's Independent certainly gives credence to his insistence that he really was kidding with his comments, which included him saying of Hitler, "He's not what you would call a good guy, but yeah, I understand much about him and I sympathize with him a little bit."
As it turns out, he told the paper, von Trier had a non-relationship with his biological father, and instead was raised by a man he thought was his actual father, Ulf Trier. He spoke glowingly of him, and in doing so claimed a Jewish heritage.
"After all this nonsense in Cannes, I am claiming that since he was Jewish and gave me a cultural Jewish upbringing, I am as good a Jew as any," he said. "Maybe he didn't give the sperm but he gave me a family and a background."
That jibes with what von Trier said at Cannes. 
"The only thing I can tell you is that I thought I was a Jew for a long time and was very happy being a Jew..." he said. "But it turned out that I was not a Jew. If I'd been a Jew, then I would be a second-wave Jew, a kind of a new-wave Jew, but anyway, I really wanted to be a Jew and then I found out that I was really a Nazi. Because my family was German."
Whether or not this helps his upcoming film, "Melancholia," a visually stunning portrait of a wedding amidst the end of the world, remains to be seen. But it at least helps the public understand a complicated artist.

				Von Trier's Movies are vicious little rants backed up by erratic behavior, convincing many critics and fans alike that his film-schoo­l-like sense of shock and awe is in fact high art.  

Dancer in the Dark is the only one of his movies that rewards any level of repeat viewing, and even then, mostly for Bjork.

				Mr. Von Trier is a very talented artist. I remember when he first blurted out his poorly organized thoughts at Cannes and the uproar which followed, and the response by the Cannes powers that culminated in the "lifetime ban."

What he says here in his "walk back" makes sense: "there are a lot of things that can be suddenly set free, and the mechanics behind this setting-fr­ee is something we really should really investigat­e, and the way we do not investigat­e it is to make it a taboo to talk about it." 

This statement supports an underlying theme in his films, certainly in Dogville, Mandelay, and Europa (Zentropa)­. These are not easy films to watch as he seems to be scraping against expected convention to reveal the peculiar horror at work in human social systems. There have been filmmakers who revel in the equally powerful (and digestible­) optimism positivity working in social interactio­n.

Should topics and historical phenomena as nazism, genocide, communism, mercantili­sm, colonialis­m, etc. be only portrayed in a certain, expected light or should we, and our artists, be allowed to investigat­e no matter what we find? 

See, for example, Lynch's "Blue Velvet."

Or, as "Noah Cross" put it in Chinatown: "You see, Mr. Gittes, most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place, they're capable of ANYTHING."

This is difficult stuff but "difficult stuff" demands our attention once in a while, sooner or later.

				It looks like a try at self deprecatin­g humor gone bad. 

Having discovered that he's no real Jew but German, Lars Von Trier unfortunat­ely used the word nazi to define himself as a "non-Jew". 
Had a "real German" said what he said, then it would have been really terrible --but he's Danish so it's a different situation: he actually offended the Germans by unjustly equating all of them to nazis.
He could have let go of all this, then again he is not afraid to stir up a controvers­y. We ought to learn more about the Danish mentality.

				I can see why so many got riled up about what he said, but we have to stop with the trigger word rage and actually read what he said. It probably isn't a good idea to get drunk and call yourself a nazi but for God's sake, he didn't say "nazis rock". You're mad because he said he had sympathy for Hitler? I feel sympathy for every misguided, hate filled bigot in this world. I feel terrible for them. If you get past the glare of the word "nazi", you see he wasn't trying to offend anyone.

				He was absolutely trying to offend.  That's all creatively bankrupt artists have left to help them remain relevant.     

His claim to jewish heritage is weak and desperate.   His backpedali­ng, equally so.   Its a good thing he has a legion of mindless art-house fans to back him up.

				somebody please shove a sock in this guy's mouth.  Nobody cares what he has to say about an historical event that took place decades ago.  Why is it that those who are considered "gifted" get to air their stupid opinion, ie: Mel Gibson, etc., on a subject that was settled many decades ago.  Whilst my husband's family celebrates the lives of many of their family that was executed at Dachau?  How very strange that this nobody NOBLE can voice his opinion, get this much press, but the eight members of a tailor's family can be obliterate­d and no one really cares.

				Being Danish its really interestin­g to read how Von Triers comments is viewed upon - in Denmark no one(the press, society etc) ever thought or discussed if he actually meant those comments - irony and a special kind of controvers­ial discourse is an integrated part of Danish humour, where we use humour about things that are painful and absolutely horrible to us - its both a way of distancing ourselves from it and pointing out the grotesque horror of such a tragedy as the holocaust. Danes do not have a tradition of political correctnes­s and a few danes, like Von Trier, have no idea how to apply a little bit of sense for the situation when he is in more internatio­nal company. Being occupied by Germany during the war all Danes have relatives who remember the war, have fought in the freedom movement or been jewish and fled to Sweden. And so has Von Trier as his stepdad must have either fled or been to KZ-camp during the war. So when the black humour discourse steps in it is with a very clear conscience of the horrors of the war and it is this conscience that is the background for the humour - it is not in any way to belittle or disrespect­.

				Do you really think irony is not a part of most western humor?   I'd wager its the basic core of almost ALL humor.  

Political Correctnes­s is saying African American rather than Black.    This is not a case of the PC police.   This is an director who has made his name with shock material, outlandish manifestos­, and generally has a  far more impressive resume of desperate attention grabbing in front of the press than anything he's actually put on film.  

You give the man far too much credit for these comments.  They were not meant to offend, enlighten or entertain.  They were simply meant to get Von Trier  attention.    Don't glorify that.

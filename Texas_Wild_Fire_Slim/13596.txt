Romania insisted Wednesday there was no evidence it had hosted secret CIA prisons as part of the United States' war on terror after September 11, 2001. The country "has no information whatsoever showing that there existed secret CIA detention centers on its territory," the Foreign Ministry told CNN. (See CNN's extensive coverage of America's war prisons.)
Two investigations also failed to find any evidence that the CIA used Romanian airports for "rendition," the process in which detainees in American custody are transported for questioning to other countries where prohibitions on torture are not as strict and American laws don't apply.
The Romanian denial comes in response to a plea from the human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe that countries that have hosted secret CIA prisons come clean. Thomas Hammarberg said Romania, Poland and Lithuania were among at least seven countries that hosted "black sites" for "enhanced interrogation" during the "war on terror."
"Darkness still enshrouds those who authorized and ran the black sites on European territories," he said. "The full truth must now be established and guarantees given that such forms of cooperation will never be repeated."
CIA officials have acknowledged the rendition program but have refused to discuss details and denied violating any laws. Efforts to challenge the agency and get details about it in U.S. courts have been turned aside. Hammarberg said the CIA held "high-value detainees," including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in Poland between 2002 and 2003.

If CIA had time to have prisons in Romania, they should tackle the human trafficking problems there, nothing else. USA, unless you deal with mankind's crimes, there is no peace for your country.

Stop being an idiot.
If America doesn't deal with global problems, you say that it's America's obligation.
If America deals with it, you scream IMPERIALISM.
You know what? I'd rather America don't help. Either way, most Europeans hate America anyway and America saves money. A done deal.

Then I have a cure for your problem.
We won't deal with YOUR Human Trafficing problem and you don't worry about our CIA, Gov't, or economy. We will close US borders for at least 3 years. No imports or exports; no foreign travel in or out; return our National Guard to do what they are enlisted to do, protect our nation and borders; make it within or live without it. If you try to sneak in, you will be met with a Seawiz. Look it up. You'll be impressed.
I'm tired of trying to protect your part of the world! We will be safe and secure because our borders are well defined. Yours on the other hand will be redefined by all of your friendly neighbors!!!!!!!
Have a great NAVY day!!!

Who cares if the CIA has these sites worldwide? It's evident parties want to harm the US so tough s-. I support these programs 100%. Only people with short memories or who have no chance whatsoever of feeling any pain from terrorism would disagree. In other words, Liberals.

Most of the comments here confirm why there is such a big level of ant-americanism in the world. What the US administration and many Americans don't get is that they aren't alone on this planet and they can not simply do whatever they want in total disrespect of human rights, civil freedoms and international laws. Who cares if the CIA tortured, killed and abducted innocent people from their own countries in total impunity?? I care and we all should care because tomorrow it could happen to one of us. I care more because my government was part of these crimes. The Americans think they are the victims here, well they are not the victims of terrorism they are the victim of the irresponsible policy of their past administrations that supported, financed and armed the radical Islamists, donât forget that bin Laden was a CIA asset in the 80s, during the Cold War. How many Afghani died back then when the Taliban were ruling the country with the support of the Americans? Nobody cares in the US. In the illegal and useless war in Iraq, up to one million Iraqis died. Who is responsible for that? Who is responsible for Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo prison, where 500 innocent people are still detained nowadays despite the fact that even Obama administration admits they are not a threat to the US whatsoever?
Who cares?? The entire world should care in order to restore justice, respect of human rights and international laws.

@charles Spoken like a true 'big, dumb, american'.  Thanks for so perfectly illustrating the moral decay in the united states of american.  You sir are the exact reason the global majority loathes the usa and perceives it as the pinnacle of rot and decay in the world.  Keep on trucking buddy, you silly goof!

Inyourface
Why denigrate the whole country? Everywhere you look around the world you have corruption and practices that are illegal. Within the cultural context some of these practices are found to be just a way of doing business; would you agree?  Why are you calling Romanian people gypsies? Do you have any knowledge about their history? Did you read anything about this culture? You should really do your research; you are out of line and you characterization is really offensive. Word of advice; educate yourself before you make idiotic comments!

DR Ruth, you talk about education, yet you have multiple spelling errors in ALL of your posts. PROOFREAD if you are going to rag on someone. By the way America has the best education system in the world, bar none. Look it up.

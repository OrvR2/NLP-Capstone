HERBACEOUS WEED CONTROL









[ Print | 

 ]



Aerial Broadcast

Where Applicable:
Aerial application of herbicide is used for the control of herbaceous weeds and grasses in areas recently planted with pine seedlings.  Applications are generally made on improved pastures, old fields, cutover areas, and prepared sites where vegetation control is desired across the entire treatment area.
Description:
Aerial applications of herbaceous weed control are typically made by helicopter with accompanying fuel and chemical support trucks.  After selecting the proper chemicals for the property based on the dominant species present, the company representative will usually delineate the treatment area boundaries with a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit.  A suitable location for landing, refueling, and refilling the chemical tanks is then located on or within a reasonable distance from the property.  The treatment area is aerial sprayed during the early periods of active growth (Feb-May) for herbaceous weeds and grasses using soil active and/or foliar active chemicals depending on the growth stage of targeted species.  Great care should be taken to avoid application on non-target areas and operations should cease when wind speed exceeds 10 miles per hour.  It is a violation of Federal Law to use these products in a manner inconsistent with their labeling (see specimen labels for general information, directions for use, precautionary statements, mixing and application instructions, etc.).
Benefits:
This practice is extremely beneficial to young pines by eliminating competing weeds and grasses within the same growing zone.  Eliminating these shallow rooted species increases the amount of available moisture, nutrients, and sunlight for seedlings.  This helps to promo the growth and improve overall survival of newly planted seedlings during the first three critical years of establishment.  Competition control results in more rapid growth of planted pines producing larger timber yields and shorter rotations for landowners. 
Other Recommendations:
Best results are obtained when the application is made during the early stages of active weed growth (February- mid May) before an established root system is developed.  A total of 5 to 10 gallons of spray solution should be applied per acre depending on vegetation density.  Contact a herbicide specialist for a chemical prescription tailored specifically to your treatment area.  It is recommended that you have a contract with the vendor and a guarantee on the chemicals used should the application be ineffective in controlling the target species.  All Texas Forestry Best Management Practices for silvicultural chemicals should be followed.
Cost: 
Aerial broadcast for herbaceous weed control ranges in cost from $40-$65/acre depending on tract size, vegetative cover, availability of vendors, chemical costs, application rates, etc.

Band Application 
Where Applicable:
Herbaceous weed control by banding is primarily conducted in improved or native pastures and light semi-open fields.  However, this method can also be performed on cutover tracts where adequate site preparation has been conducted.
Description:
The primary herbicides used in banding operations are imazapyr (Arsenal) and sulfometuron methyl (Oust).  Other chemicals may be added to the tank mix for an additional cost to broaden the control of undesirable plant species.   Bands are applied using rubber-tired tractors, ATV’s, or backpack sprayers.  Rubber tired tractors are equipped with rear-mounted spray tanks and booms with adjustable nozzles for treating several rows simultaneously.  ATV’s with rear-mounted tanks are also commonly used but normally spray only one row at a time.  Backpack sprayers are sometimes used when acreage, tract location, or other factors make the use of other equipment impractical.  Herbicides are generally applied in 3-4 foot wide bands.  4-foot bands or wider are preferred as encroachment of herbaceous material is delayed longer than with more narrow bands.  Application is normally conducted in April-May with effectiveness reduced after June 1.  It is a violation of Federal Law to use these products in a manner inconsistent with their labeling (see specimen labels for general information, directions for use, precautionary statements, mixing and application instructions, etc.).
Benefits:
Application of herbicide by banding reduces competition between the newly planted seedlings and established herbaceous weeds and grasses.  Water, and nutrients within the banded row that would otherwise have been utilized by the herbaceous material is made available to the pines.  Although still dependent upon spring rains, summer weather and the quality of the planting operation, first year survival and growth is significantly improved through the use of this practice.  Depending upon seedling spacing, improved pasture grasses may still be cut and baled for several years providing a continued source of revenue to the landowner.  Band application of herbicides in comparison to broadcast applications reduces treatment cost.
Other Recommendations: 
Consistent spacing of rows by the planting vendor will make herbicide application easier and more effective.  If rows cannot be easily determined, then broadcast application by air or ground will be necessary resulting in increased application costs to the landowner.  The hardest species of grass to control is Bermuda and should be actively growing before herbicide is applied.  The later in the spring the herbicide is applied the better and even then, with abundant spring rains, the Bermuda grass may encroach by August.  The problem with waiting until the Bermuda grass is growing is that the rows may be very difficult to locate and flagging may be needed.  Goatweed (Croton sp.), shown in the picture above, is commonly one of the first herbaceous species to recover from herbicide treatment.  Although it will readily become established in the treated rows, the limited amount of shade it produces will pose little threat to seedling survival and growth.  All Texas Forestry Best Management Practices for silvicultural chemicals should be followed.
Cost:
Approximately $35-45 per acre for openland banding and $40.00-$60.00 for wildland banding depending upon tract size, location, availability of vendors, chemical costs, etc.  In contrast, broadcast applications for complete coverage of the entire planting area will range between $50.00- 60.00 per acre.

Spot Treatment
Where Applicable:
This practice is used primarily as a method of chemical control for herbaceous weeds and grasses in areas recently planted with pine seedlings.  Applic ations are generally made on improved and unimproved pastures, old fields, cutover areas, and prepared sites where partial coverage with the chemical is desired.
Description:
Spot applications of herbaceous weed control are accomplished through the use of a backpack or ATV-mounted sprayer pressurized with air.  After selecting the proper chemical or mixture for control of the dominant undesirable species present, the vendor will spray herbicide around each seedling. Each chemical application “spot” should be a minimum of approximately 18-24” in diameter. The treatment area should be spot sprayed during the early periods of active growth (Feb-May) for herbaceous weeds and grasses using soil active and/or foliar active chemicals depending on the growth stage of targeted species.  It is a violation of Federal Law to use these products in a manner inconsistent with their labeling (see specimen labels for general information, directions for use, precautionary statements, mixing and application instructions, etc.).
Benefits:
Herbicide application is extremely beneficial to young pines by eliminating competing weeds and grasses within the same growing zone.  Eliminating these shallow rooted species increases the amount of available moisture, nutrients, and sunlight for newly planted seedlings.  This helps to promote seedling growth and improve overall survival during the first three critical years of establishment.  Competition control results in more rapid growth producing larger timber yields and shorter rotations for landowners. Spot treatment is especially useful on smaller acreages, or where aerial or skidder operations are not feasible.  This practice focuses on vegetation in the immediate area of young seedlings leaving untreated areas for soil stabilization, wildlife forage, cover, habitat, etc.
Other Recommendations:
Best results are obtained when the application is made during the early stages of active weed growth (February- mid May) before an established root system is developed.  It is recommended that you have a contract with the vendor and a guarantee on the chemicals used should the application be ineffective in controlling the targeted species.  All applicable Texas Forestry Best Management Practices for silvicultural chemicals should be followed.
Cost: 
Approximately $40-$65/acre depending on tract size, vegetative cover, availability of vendors, chemical costs, application rates, etc.

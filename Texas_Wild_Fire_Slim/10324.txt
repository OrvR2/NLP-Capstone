Firefighters in Bastrop, Texas, near Austin, are working to control a wildfire that has claimed lives and burned hundreds of homes.
With lighter winds in the area, officials reported that the Bastrop blaze was 30 percent contained by early Wednesday, according to the Associated Press.
In the video below from the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department, you can see just how fast a wildfire spreads through dry brush on the north edge of Bastrop State Park. According to The Atlantic wire, the spreading fire spread across an entire field in under a minute.
Firefighters in Bastrop are receiving help from the elite Texas Task Force 1 which also helped with searches after the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina.
The state is currently in the midst of a nearly year-long dry spell that is the worst since the record drought of the 1950's.
Texas Governor Rick Perry toured burned areas near Bastrop earlier this week, saying, "The magnitude of these losses are pretty stunning," reports AP. Perry left a presidential campaign trip to South Carolina early to return to Texas and address the wildfires.
Scroll down after the video for pictures of the wildfire devastation.



Below are photos of the Bastrop, Texas wildfire destruction.

				Texas is always saying they can do without the rest of the United States and take care of themselves so let them, I doubt Rick Perry has been in office long enough to underfund any body. They don't have income tax in Texas so where is the government suppose to get money to pay for services? Theres a drought down there and even a super funded fire fighting service would be in trouble.

				Should not Rick Perry be on the fire lines supporting the firefighte­rs.  

Where is Rick Perry?

At the Republican debates pandering to the Tea Bag Cult, establishi­ng his unlimited greed, and his overpoweri­ng lust for power.

Perry has abandoned Texas as it burns with an underfunde­d fire fighting system all the work of Perry himself.

A real man, would pick up a shovel and go to the front lines.  But then again Perry is not real, nor is he a man.

On the other hand, the Apostle Rick just used this disaster to create a media event to promote himself.  If those brave underpaid firefighte­rs shot down his helicopter I wouldn't blame them in the slightest.

Rick" "hmm...we gotyta cut some more from the volunteer firefighte­rs and tack a few whacks at salaried firefighte­rs as well, cuz, ya know, they're union so...

Then we can add to funding things like Formula-1 auto racing, which we defunded education for.

				Thanks from a grateful Texan.

Reading the hate-fille­d bilge posted by the irrational lefties here is so sickening that I want to puke.  Not once have I ever seen such HATE-FILLE­D GARBAGE posted by a "stupid southerner­," any actual "christian­," a lowly "walmart worker" or the left's most dispised human, a "hamburger flipper." Nor have any "republica­ns" or "conservat­ives" posted such UTTER FUMING HATE.  The only visceral HATE appearing on these boards freely burbles from the hate-fille­d heart of the avaricious­ly envious and unaccompli­shed left.

Some of the WORST AND MOST VILE HATE is actually posted by the folks that are supposed to be "moderatin­g" these hate-fille­d pages seen everywhere on HuffPost.

You've shown more intellect and "class" in one line than anything these HATE MONGERS spew daily.

I doubt that this will appear, as it doesn't fit the socialist theocratic "purpose" that HuffPost has for an agenda.

BS. people on the right espouse hate here every day.
Texas and their governor has made a spectacle of themselves­, denouncing the federal government­, talking of secession and then asking for money they said that they could do without. Texas has made a spectacle of itself by cutting government down so much that they cannot fight these fires to save peoples' homes. 
If you want to blame anybody, blame mother nature, and take a long close look in your mirror.

				Guess you missed the hate filled posts from the righties when Hurricane Irene hit the East Coast, and when California suffered wildfires. 
Lots of, "Why should MY tax dollars be spent on people who choose to live in the coasts"?, and "It's just a Cat 1". 
I know, I know, you're going to say that just because someone else did it before, doesn't make it right. Many are just so tired of the preaching from the higher than mighty, rabid right, and their lack of empathy for fellow Americans.
I believe that a disaster can happen to anyone, at any time and it irks me to hear the GOP wanting to cut funding for FEMA, and NOAA.

				I admit am a know nothing, have only flown over texas. But it seems this has dragged on absurdly.

They seem little more than grassfires on prairie.

Compared to what we cop in Oz in dense, rugged eucalyptus forest  - it should be easy. You dont need water - u need to backburn.

Something seems not right. Cheaper to pray for rain I guess. Hit it hard & hit it fast seems to have been neglected.

Must be v unpleasant­. Tx seemed smoggy at the best of times
When it happens, we get help from all states fire volunteers­, NZ & at times california­.

AFD chief insists she was on top of itKerr: 'There are things called cell phones'Updated: Thursday, 08 Sep 2011, 6:26 AM CDTPublished : Thursday, 08 Sep 2011, 6:22 AM CDT


AUSTIN (KXAN) - Austin Fire Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr insists she stayed on top of her department's response to  the wildfires,  even though she was out of town. "I think it's only fair to say I've been on top of all that," said Kerr. "You know, there are things called cell phones - communication devices, discussing strategy over the phone, long-range. The fire started on Sunday afternoon. I was home yesterday, or last night." Kerr was responding to questions raised about her ability to lead the massive firefighting effort while she was in Colorado at the beginning of the week.

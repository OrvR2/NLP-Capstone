Forest HealthThe Texas Forest Service employs a staff of professional forest pest and forest health specialists who provide assistance and solutions to forest and urban tree pest problems.Forest Health (formerly called Forest Pest Management) was established in 1962 as the Forest Pest Control Section to deal with an increasing southern pine beetle problem in Southeast Texas. The southern pine beetle is the most destructive forest insect pest in the southern United States.Over the years, Forest Health’s responsibilities have expanded beyond southern pine beetle to include survey, evaluation, applied research and technology transfer on all major forest insects and diseases in the state. Most forest pest problems that are dealt with occur in the commercial forest of the East Texas Piney Woods. However, Forest Health personnel also administer a cooperative project in Central Texas to suppress oak wilt, a tree disease that kills live oaks and other oaks in over 60 counties. In 1996, Forest Health initiated the Western Gulf Forest Pest Management Cooperative — now called the Forest Pest Management Cooperative — to provide leadership and guidance to the forest industry on forest pest issues. The department also deals with exotic invasive plants, insects and diseases that could threaten the state’s forest resources.Forest Health has three professional forest entomologists — two in Lufkin and one in College Station — as well as an experienced support staff. The team also leans on foresters with experience in tree and woodland pest problems who are located throughout Central Texas and in major cities across the state.Just remember: When forest, tree or pest problems arise, help is readily available from Forest Health specialists and field foresters. Feel free to bug them! Forest Health specialists can be contacted in Lufkin at (936) 639-8170, College Station at (979) 458-6650, Austin at (512) 339-4589 or through any local Texas Forest Service field office.

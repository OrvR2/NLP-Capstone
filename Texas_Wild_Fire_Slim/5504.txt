In case all the ads splashed across store windows, magazine pages and websites didn’t explain it enough, Fashion’s Night Out is a global event aimed to promote shopping and help spur business … with a stylish twist, of course. For one night only on Thursday, September 8, stores in cities from Manhattan to Milan and London to Los Angeles stay open late and host special open-to-the-public events to get people spending while having a good time. Although there are too many to list in full, here are some noteworthy events for Fashion’s Night Out Los Angeles going on from 6pm to 10pm, unless otherwise noted.

Forget buyer's remorse. You'll get a shopper's high on the 60-foot Ferris wheel on Rodeo Drive during Fashion's Night Out. The festivities promise to be an all-out carnival of fun with countless cocktail parties, celebrity appearances, flamethrowers and stilt walkers, 17 food trucks, 68 retailers hosting in-store events and a special Cirque du Soleil Flipbook Experience where you can insert yourself into the show (and enter to win a show package including dinner & stay for two at The Beverly Hilton). The three-block party also includes free trolley service throughout the evening.

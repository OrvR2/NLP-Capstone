The sperm donor with 150 kidsThe Week – 17 hrs ago





Cynthia Daily had a child with a sperm donor, then discovered that her kid had at least 150 half-siblings — and a range of potential medical and emotional risksNobody knows exactly how many children are conceived with donated sperm, but an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 such babies are born in the U.S. each year. According to The New York Times, many of these children have more half-siblings than their parents bargained for. One mother, Cynthia Daily, used a donor registry to trace at least 150 children to the same sperm donor who fathered her son. "It's wild when we see them all together — they all look alike," says Daily, who sometimes vacations with other families who used the same donor. But such large pools of related offspring face increased risk for rare genetic disorders, not to mention accidental incest between donor siblings. Is it too dangerous to let one man father 150 kids?
 Yes, we need an intervention:  It's nice that so many infertile couples are having kids with the help of sperm donors, but the U.S. donor-bank industry needs to be regulated, as in other countries, says Sam Biddle in Gizmodo. Granted, "a government eye on the conception of children" is a little spooky, but I'd rather err on the "sci-fi dystopian" side than deal with gene mutations and the "gross factor of half siblings having sex on a large scale.""Overused sperm means bigger risk of brother/sister sexin'"
 Don't interfere in this Darwinian unnatural selection:  Clearly, this "dude with 150 kids" is doing something right if "150 different women independently chose his DNA as 'the right stuff,'" says Matthew Kahn in Environmental and Urban Economics. Sure, we need a diversified gene pool, but if all these ladies looked at the menu and chose "this guy as the King," perhaps we should be paying him more for his high-quality DNA instead of stopping him from producing."Selfish reasons to have more kids?"
 What about the kids?  Without government regulation, parents have created networks to "work through the thorny issues" of having so many half-siblings, says Cathy Ruse in National Review. For example, "one mother has instructed her child to memorize the donor number of her father so that she can compare notes with possible future mates." Which raises the biggest question: How much damage does having 150 siblings inflict on "the tender psyche of a little child"?"Brave New World: Sperm donor daddy tracks 70 children on Excel sheetView this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:Opinion Brief: Jailing Balloon Boy's parentsOpinion Brief: Will spanking make your child successful?Opinion Brief: Should babies be allowed in bars?Like on Facebook - Follow on Twitter - Sign-up for Daily Newsletter

If society are outrage with this story like polygamy, then who ever patronize these sperm bank should have known better. But then we are no better than the other animals are we? When we realize our family are endangered of extinction sperm bank is the answer because the other solution could be more expensive or could not swallow the act of procreation for some women  and men just wanted to help ? We are going to for extinction anyway.

I find it arrogant and disturbing that someone thinks they will "let" him or not. If he wants his child support donation cup to runneth over, so be it. Gengis Khan sired a good chunk of Asia and it seems to have worked out pretty well for him, as the kids were already mongoloid, and their descendants seem to have taken over owning a good chunk of the world. I kinda feel sorry for the guy. His genes are good enough, but obviously he can't get a date to do it in person. As for the whiny question of how having 150 siblings will affect "the tender psyche of a little child", I would imagine they either don't care, or will get beat up a lot by the older ones, or have a great repository of organ and blood donors, and people to borrow money from.

Exactly why you folks that are out here making babies outside of your home and relationships ( and keeping them a secret)  should reconsider. You wouldn't want your kids to accidently sleep with each other - would you?

This so called dad is bragging in this article... he has no idea how many actual children he fathered... the clinics don't tell him that.. and he isn't privledge to find out that information.  He might be bragging about how many times he deposited his stuff into a cup and got paid for it.  Not all ... and quite a few times rarely are the donations resulting in a successful pregnancy.  The odds are getting better with better technology, but this is another half truth article from Yahoo.

Flat nasty, this whole business. It's the mentality of the world that someone has the right to be a mother or father. No they don't. All the dystopia that Time is worried about has already happened, and is walking around in society like a Frankenstein's monster. Shut down fertility clinics! Or we will be getting incest cases...

That's a sad commentary when women would rather opt for 'daddy in a bottle' than put up with an actual husband.

The real losers here are the children, who have a father from a test tube. I saw a special on TV once and one of the children said that she would never know her father.  How sad.

Ok now im confused... i am morally against this, but i can't explain why.  No sex took place, thats comforting... and no abortions were performed, also good... and no birth control, excellent... but still it seems wrong to me... praise jesus, btw...

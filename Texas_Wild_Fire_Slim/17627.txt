Weekly Weather: A blessed cool front ends the warmest summer on record in the United States

Welcome to your weekly weather update, in which I’ll attempt to sum up the immediate past, present and future of weather on the bayou. This week, amazingly, will see cool nights. Not so amazingly, alas, is that both the days and nights will continue to be extremely dry.
PAST
Wow.
Have you stepped outside this morning? It’s almost enough to make one forget how brutal this summer was. Almost.
Before we get to the forecast, let’s take one final look at just how ridiculously warm this summer (as defined by June through August) was for Texas and Oklahoma.
The warmest summer on record for any state, in any year, was set by Oklahoma in 1934. That came during the heart of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. The average temperature was 85.2 degrees.
Fast forward to today: We’re not in a depression, but we just came out of a bad recession and there are fears we’re heading back into a second one. And we’re in the midst of another historic drought, although it hasn’t lasted nearly so long yet as some droughts past including the Dust Bowl.
In any case, both Texas and Oklahoma are going to obliterate the heat record set in 1934.
Although the statewide average temperatures won’t come out for another day or so, unofficially Victor Murphy with the National Weather Service tells me Texas is likely to end the summer with an average temperature of 86.7 degrees, and Oklahoma with an average temperature of 86.8 degrees.
The following table lists some of the larger cities on the southern plains that have set or nearly set temperature records this summer.

Murphy tells me of the statewide temperatures for Texas and Oklahoma:
It is very likely that the official NCDC values will differ from these by perhaps 0.1 to 0.3 degrees F.  However, at the end of the day, the screaming message remains that each state will have exceed a 117-year summertime high temperature record by 1 to 1.5 degrees F.
So yes, you lived through something historic this summer in Texas. And yes, that first cool front of the fall, which has come about two weeks earlier than normal, is a real godsend.
Anyway, let’s do the numbers for last week.

PRESENT
This week’s weather  will be much cooler, with daytime highs around 90, rising to the low 90s by the weekend. Overnight lows should remain in the low to mid-60s until the the weekend, when they’re forecast to rise into the mid- to upper 60s.
The reason for these pleasant temperatures, say forecasters with the Houston/Galveston office of the National Weather Service, is a steady northerly wind that will prevent the warm, moist onshore flow from the Gulf Mexico from returning until late this weekend.
Importantly for wildfires near Houston and near Austin, the strong winds that developed from Tropical Storm Lee this weekend have died down, and winds should remain at modest levels for most of this week.
Unfortunately, there will be little relief from the skies, with dry conditions expected to persist into at least early next week. In fact, some long-range models don’t show a chance of rain returning to Houston until the weekend of Sept. 17.
This map from the North American Ensemble Forecast System tells the sad truth of things. It shows the probability of a certain area getting 1 inch or more of rainfall, total, between now and Sept. 20:
(NAEFS)
It’s not a good story for Texas.
FUTURE
To begin with, let’s take a look at the tailgate weather for next Sunday’s Texans-Colts football game, which kicks off at noon. For early September it looks surprisingly good.
Now bear in mind this is a six-day forecast, but at the moment temperatures are predicted to rise from around 70 degrees at 8 a.m. to the upper 80s by kick-off, with a slight northerly wind. Humidity is forecast to be low under mostly sunny skies.
All in all, it should be great weather to kick the Colts back to Indy.
Taking a broader view, let’s look into the tropics as we enter what is historically the busiest time of the year for tropical activity. And they are busy indeed.
In the satellite photo below you can see that major Hurricane Katia has developed a large eye as it moves northwest across the open Atlantic Ocean.
Satellite photo from early this morning. (NexSat, NRL/JPSS)
Fortunately it now appears very likely that Katia will curve to the north, and then the northeast well before reaching the United States. The track models are in good agreement on this and the biggest threat is to Bermuda.
But wait, there’s more.
Tropical weather outlook. (National Hurricane Center)
Deeper in the tropics there’s Invest 95L about 700 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands (marked at “1″ above), which should become a tropical storm or depression during the next couple of days. It’s very difficult to say with any confidence, but right now it does not look like this system will track toward the Gulf of Mexico, but it could threaten the Caribbean Islands and Florida or the East Coast of the United States next week.
Then there’s another disturbance in the Bay of Campeche (marked as “2″) that some models develop into a tropical system this week.
The models are all over the place with this system, which could get dragged southwest into Mexico, or eventually pulled toward the northeast, perhaps making a landfall in Florida. It’s something to also watch during the next several days, but it appears the high pressure settling into place over Texas will keep the storm away from the greater Houston area.
SUMMARY
This week’s scale goes from 0 to 44, the number of no.1 singles recorded by George Strait. He’s sold 70 million records.
My number: 32.
FINE PRINT
As always, thank you to the fine professionals at the National Weather Service for the information and data that make this weekly blog entry possible. Also, bear in mind there’s always uncertainty in weather forecasting, particularly the timing and intensity of precipitation.

Best blog yet Eric.  You mentioned Oklahoma and George Strait in the same blog  .  On a serious note, I feel sorry for all the fire victims.  It’s getting really bad out there.  We went to Brazos Bend State Park this weekend and it’s starting to look really bad out there.  Big, huge beautiful trees all along the drive from Katy to Brazos bend were all browning and dying.  With all the trees and vegetation all dead everyone needs to keep fire safety in mind.  A wildfire can start and get out hand VERY fast.

First of all, thanks Eric for keeping us updated.  Second…the weather felt great this morning.  And third please say that the heat-dome high pressure is not returning.

I’m sure Eric can offer a better explanation, but from what I can gather, the dome will be returning / strengthening throughout the week.

I imagine there have always been plenty of cactus bushes around the hill country, but they seem very obvious now and it seems to be a sign of the times… the hill country is turning into desert hills…so sad…
Also, we did find one little Turtle Creek that still had water and a snorkeler in it!!!

With the high pressure dome moved off of the state, and with the cooler air coming down, I’m not worried about a hurricane or TD hitting us now, but will this set up increase our chances of rain? I know that they were saying that we may stay in a drought through December, and then it was increased for next year, but with the high pressure moved off, what are our chances next week or there after for moisture?


Reply 





Lisa says: 

			September 6, 2011 at 3:07 pm 
I think the high pressure will be back, and 90 as opposed to 100 is not cool enough to keep hurricanes away. 90 is still pretty darn hot, just cool compared to 110 heat. Just saying.

That wind was something else last weekend!
I was in College Station on Sunday for the game against SMU. As we arrived in town, several exits to town from Highway 6 were blocked off. There was a 100 acre fire there that still hadn’t been extinguished completely by midnight. Adding insult to injury was a fire some 30 miles north of College Station. The wind out of the north carried the ashes of that fire (covering 600+ acres) all the way to Kyle Field by the third quarter.
On another note, it was gorgeous this morning. I went out to get the paper off the driveway at 5:45 and thought, “I missed this!”
Winds were out of the north at 25, gusting to 40mph at kickoff.

so why hasn’t this high pressure moved like we were promised week after week for the last several weeks?

The promises were based on weather forecasts that, unfortunately, turned out to be mistaken.

“…however the very dry soil over the Texas region intensified the drought and allowed a semi-permanent upper-level high pressure to build over the area keeping most of the rain bearing tropical disturbances either south or east of the Texas Gulf Coast. …”
If, for fifty years, we have replaced the soil with hot concrete (highways, parking lots, tarmac, buildings and roads); pray tell what happens to “upper level high pressure” over these areas?
It makes sense, unless the front was strong enough, the rain would just go around them (Chase the rain back into the clouds?)

“The warmest month on record for any state, in any year, was set by Oklahoma in 1934.”
Isn’t this supposed to be warmest “summer” on record?

the main thing i disagree with you on eric is that we ARE in a depression and not a recession.it’s just that noone wants to admit it.

Recession, depression or another opportunity to make money…it all depends on your vantage point. The top 10 percent are doing well and expensive homes are selling like hotcakes. 
What I am trying to figure out is if we are a consumer driven economy where are the consumers going to get the money to do their consumimg when most of them have no job or only a subsistance job with zero discressionary income. Last time I checked robots were not big consumers. We seem hell bent on engeering ourselves out of the loop.

Boys and girls,
I have to disagree with Eric.
We are in a depression.  
Just because we still have automobiles
does not mean we are in a recession.
They had automobiles in the 30′s.
It is what they used to go to California.
Now they are using them to leave California.
And they are coming to Texas.

If you count all the ratings charts (not just Billboard Country) – and include his crossover songs that don’t conveniently fit the C&W genre –  George Strait has 57 No. 1 hits to his credit.

Your Weekly FSI Report:……The T.V. Fear Mongers said that Wednesday August 31st would be the last day we would see 100 degree temps…WRONG. Thursday it was 102 and Friday was 101……They said we wouldn’t mind the rain ruining Labor Day week-end with soaking rain. Thursday-Friday-Saturday-Sunday…WRONG. They said New Orleans would suffer another devastating flood with 24 inches of rain…WRONG.(Remember they also said Newy York city would have 11 feet of water?)…You Fear Monger apologists may now begin……..YOUR FSI.

Thanks for the regular updates, Eric. 
Cool weather is…er, cool. However I am still mad at TS Lee for taunting us and adding insult to injury. Sure didn’t give us any rain, but did it have to hit us with those winds to fan the wildfires? Humph!
I hope the fires are put out soon and people don’t lose their homes. Water restrictions have become mandatory in many areas.

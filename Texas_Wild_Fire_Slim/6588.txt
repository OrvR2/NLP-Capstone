We're all busy. Work, activities, errands, bills, responsibilities, friends -- sometimes it all turns into one big run-on sentence and we forget to take a minute to ... breathe. Pause. Smile. Notice the small things. It can take just a moment to give everyday life a little perspective.
Check back here every afternoon for a new "mOMent" to enjoy. Have a great idea for one? Send along a photo or video to moment@huffingtonpost.com!

World Black Africans Escalate Complaints of Harassment by Libya Rebels

Editor’s note: An earlier Blaze post on thousands of black Africans being held prisoner by Libyan rebels can be found here.
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) — A Ghanaian teacher cowers in his house, certain he will be grabbed at a checkpoint because of his dark skin. Armed rebels detain 19 Ukrainian cooks and oil workers for several days on unsupported claims that they are really snipers for Moammar Gadhafi.
They‘re among thousands of foreigners caught in a web of suspicion as rebel fighters pursue the remnants of Gadhafi’s forces. Gadhafi hired some foreigners as mercenaries, but many others held ordinary jobs in Libya, and the rebels who ousted the Gadhafi regime from most of Tripoli last month often seem to make little effort to tell them apart.
“How can we be snipers?” cook Maksim Shadrov asked angrily at a training center for oil workers in Tripoli where he, his wife and 17 other Ukrainians were being held.
“They are old. She is a woman. We are not snipers,” he said, pointing to some members of his group. Even a rebel commander conceded that he had no evidence to the contrary, but held them nonetheless, despite a diplomat’s efforts to free them.
In rebel-run Tripoli, people with dark skin — even Libyans — are at risk because Gadhafi is known to have recruited soldiers from sub-Saharan Africa.
“Every black is a target,” said Tony Biney, the Ghanaian teacher, who stayed home with his wife for two weeks before risking a trip to church.

There have been widespread arrests and frequent abuse of migrant workers since the rebels seized Tripoli late last month, Human Rights Watch said Sunday, but did not give an estimate of the number of detainees. The group said the clampdown created “a grave sense of fear among the city’s African population.”
A rebel official estimated that some 5,000 people have been detained since rebels seized Tripoli. At one makeshift detention camp, conditions for Libyan detainees were acceptable, but sub-Saharan Africans were held in overcrowded cells with a putrid stench, Human Rights Watch said. The detainees complained of a lack of water and poor sanitation.
The detentions have created an image problem for the rebel leadership, which relies heavily on Western support and has pledged to build a new Libya based on the rule of law, in contrast to Gadhafi’s brutal regime.
The harsh treatment could also cause problems for the rebels as they attempt to rebuild Libya’s economy, which has depended heavily on foreign workers to keep up with its oil boom. However, the draw of steady, well-paid employment may in the end be stronger than the fear of mistreatment.
Before the six-month civil war that brought down Gadhafi, hundreds of thousands of foreigners filled jobs Libyans didn‘t want or weren’t trained for, including in construction, oil and health services. Data is sketchy, but some estimates say at least 1.5 million foreigners worked in Libya, a country of just 6 million.
The workers are mainly Africans, Asians and Eastern Europeans, lured from economically depressed countries by Libya’s relatively high wages.
Hundreds of thousands of them fled Libya after the outbreak of fighting in February, many complaining at the time that they had not been paid or were robbed by Gadhafi troops on the way to the border. Others were either unable or unwilling to leave.
On Sunday, Human Rights Watch called on the rebels to stop arbitrary arrests and to set up a system to review cases of people alleged to be mercenaries. The New York-based group said it has evidence that the Gadhafi regime recruited hundreds of mercenaries from Chad, Sudan and other countries — but noted that cannot serve as the basis for mass arrests.
The rebel leadership “has legitimate concerns about unlawful mercenaries and violent activity, but it can’t simply arrest dark-skinned men just in case they think they might be mercenaries,” said Sarah Leah Whitson of Human Rights Watch.
The rebels’ National Transitional Council has called on fighters not to abuse prisoners and says those accused of crimes will receive fair trials.
In one sign of possible change, an official for the U.N.’s main refugee agency, Sam Cheung, said several dozen Somalis were released to his group Sunday.
“We are hoping this is a model, a first transaction,” Cheung said.
The Philippines sent a senior diplomat to give some 1,700 Filipino workers, mostly nurses, the option of leaving. A government official said four Filipino housemaids who worked for a Gadhafi relative will take the offer.
Some workers said they hadn’t been harassed by either side in the war. Others, including some of the Ukrainian detainees, planned to stay in Libya despite receiving rough treatment.
“As you know, life in the Ukraine is bad,” said Shadrov, the cook. “We came here to earn money for our family.”
The Ukrainians, hired by the Russian-Libyan oil company Dakara, arrived in Tripoli in July. After the rebels entered the capital on Aug. 21, the Ukrainians were detained by rebel fighters, handcuffed and moved to various locations, Shadrov said.
“They took everything from us,” he said. “Money, passports, computers, everything.”
Othman bin Othman, the rebel commander in charge of the oil workers’ training center, initially said the Ukrainians were armed and trained as snipers, but changed his account after reporters interviewed the detainees.
“To be very honest, we didn’t find any weapons in their houses or on them, but they arrived into the country illegally and during a very sensitive time — after the war,” he said. “This led us to believe they were working for the enemy.”
Diplomats from Russia and Ukraine visited the group, and Shadrov’s father, a Russian citizen, was able to leave.
At a meeting with the rebels, the Ukrainian consul was asked to bring back a written promise that if the Ukrainians are allowed to leave the detention center, they will stay in their homes and not leave the country without proper documentation.
Some of Gadhafi’s real mercenaries, meanwhile, have already left.
Mohamed, a migrant worker from Mali, said he came to Libya in 2007 and found work in restaurants and as a gardener.
Speaking in the Mali town of Bamako, he said he briefly joined a pro-Gadhafi militia after the outbreak of the uprising, and was sent to try to crush rebels in the port city of Misrata, a stronghold of the revolt. He said he stopped fighting after a couple of weeks and returned to Mali.
Mohamed did not give his last name because he said did not want anyone to know he fought for Gadhafi. He said he still has family in Libya and has not been able to get in touch with them for more than two weeks.
Biney, the Ghanaian teacher, and his wife, a housekeeper, said they will stay in Libya. They need the money.
They’re continuing to keep a low profile, but left their home Friday to make a quick dash to St. Francis Catholic Church in downtown Tripoli. They hired a driver for $90, a steep sum, they said, since they haven’t worked or been paid for six months.
They did it, Vida Biney said, to say a prayer of thanks for surviving the war.
“We are alive. We are grateful to God,” she said.

We should be asking about the situation as it relates to Louis Farrakhan, and Reverend White’s support of Gaddafi.  Is this payback to the blacks overseas even though they were not involved?  Do the Libyan rebels hate the black community in America too, and they are starting in their country first?
This is something that should worry all of us.  I believe it is our duty to stand up for these people being rounded up and imprisoned, or even worse because of a perceived support of the dictator.  Black White Christian or not, none of them deserve to be convicted of a crime unless they have actually committed a heinous crime.
If it comes to our shores, we should not let the Libyans round up Reverend White or even Louise Farrakhan.  No matter how you feel about those two, it’s not right and we know it.

You‘re assuming that Libyans are rounding up blacks even though they know they’re innocent, but the fact of the matter is that there were so many blacks involved in attacks on the Libyan rebels and civilians, during which many atrocities were committed,  the only way the Libyans have of determining guilt or innocence is to interrogate each one.   Many are war criminals.  The rebels warned the black mercenaries they would be held accountable if they lost.  They’re being held accountable now.
This is not a peacetime scenario and is common in every country after civil wars to determine who the enemies are.  It’s not a policy that is invoked during peacetime.  This is not the same as rounding up civilians during peacetime.   The only means of identifying them is by their race.
Many Germans were rounded up after WWII  by the allies and investigated and interrogated to determine any cupability for war crimes, because it wasn‘t known who was a Nazi and who wasn’t.
The only reason there’s an outcry in this instance is because the radical leftist press deems blacks as privileged persons.
If the perps were Arab or white, these same MSM radicals would be highlighting the atrocities they committed, not painting them as victims.

There is more to be afraid of since the “Rebels” are the very terrorists that the US is always saying we need to be careful of and if we aide them in any way we can be imprisoned.  Go Figure.  Yes my dear sheeple, the ‘Rebels’ are the LIFG which is lead by none other than the top Al Qaeda members who have also been in Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas shooting AMERICANS!
Our government is guilty of the very crimes they have themselves posted during the “War on Terror.”  They themselves are breaking their own law in Libya.  This isn’t anything new, look at Fast and Furious which the President (it is now KNOWN) approved it.  Mexican armed troops are coming across our southern border and shooting at our Border Patrol and even civilians, but you don’t see anything about it here.  I’m VERY disappointed in Glenn and the Blaze.  Of course it might help if he didn’t have at least ONE of his writers here that is also a writer for HuffPo.  My mind … it is a changin’. about Glenn.  He says just enough to get the trust.  He tells the truth only so far.  It’s taken YEARS for me to come to this conclusion and I have him to thank for opening my eyes and telling me to “Do my Homework”  I have and I’m not liking what I see in him now.  It’s a shame.  I was a loyal listener for a long LONG time.  Sad.. very sad.

This could ALL have BEEN AVOIDED – if people had
RESPECTED NATIONAL BORDERS!!!
If those who entered the country ILLEGALLY had not done so, then, there would be no cause to worry about them. A desire for higher wages is not a legitimate reason to break the law and to trespass/invade a country illegally.
While I wish better for those who are not as well off as we are, breaking the law is not the correct means to go about improving one’s lot in life. Hard work is the primary means. A more significant means is hard work in the form of POLITICAL REFORMS / movements AT HOME. Such movements and reforms improve not only one’s own situation, but also that of ALL THOSE AROUND you.
TAKING the easy route is selfish and momentary, and does nothing to correct the ROOT CAUSE/ISSUE.
Who is John Gault?
Fleeing a situation, instead of FIXING it, is not the answer – it is AN answer, but, it does not resolve the problem – it AVOIDS the problem. It is a coward’s way out.
Plus, a man who is willing to break the law once, has PROVEN his willingness to break the law. He now only needs self-justification to do it again and again. (“I was hungry” becomes, “It‘s only ’fair’” becomes, “They all had one” becomes, “Why not?” then, “So what?” and eventually, “Who cares?”)
.
.
.
Race? That was just the most common denominator – the trait which most of the illegals had in common – simplest means of trying to identify a believed threat.
Not saying it is/was right or wrong.

This is to be expected. Foreign mercenaries who fought for the old regime are commonly targets for vicious reprisals by successful revolutionaries: hence the fate of Louis XVI’s Swiss guards, the Cossacks after the Russian Revolution, and so on. In the Libyan case, the element of racism is not surprising, as the mercenaries who fought for Qaddafi are mostly blacks from sub-Saharan Africa.
What surprises me about the Obama administration is not its failure to rein in the Libyan rebels, but its apparently total disregard of the famine raging in Somalia and the refugees overflowing camps in Kenya. After all, this, not Libya, is the part of Africa where Obama actually does have some roots.

Are you gonna put some boots on the ground to help these Black people, President Big Shot? You won’t because the rest of the Arab nations who also put blacks in camps will dis-own you.

So the Pol Pot/Stalin style extermination begins.  It always ends this way with violent changes of ‘government’.  Blood baths due to begin in 3…2…1…
In No Place to Hide, Grathwohl explains that the Weathermen (Bill Ayers & Co) actually believed that they would be successful in overthrowing the U.S. government and that, with the help of the Cubans, Chinese, Russians, and North Vietnamese, they would occupy America. Americans would have to be “re-educated” in camps, similar to what the communists did in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and other countries they had taken over.

“Black Africans Escalate Complaints of Harassment by Libya Rebels”
What’s wrong with staying at home in their own countries, working to make it better instead of acting like parasites on another economy?
There were literally thousands of blacks that were involved in atrocities and attacks on Libyans for which the Libyans complained about at the time they were occurring, some of which were photographed.
They’re all peace-loving victims when they’re caught or disbanded because their side lost.

I doubt it. The Libyans are Africans too, since they live in Africa. The people in question come from the parts of Africa south of the Sahara, where the predominant skin tone is darker, hence “black.”

Karma at work. 
Now the black Africans know how white Africans feel when they are harassed, raped and their farms/lands stolen.  I knew a white S. African who migrated to the USA.  He said S. Africa is a sty now.  Corruption everywhere, nothing gets done.  He said whites are routinely discriminated against in employment.   Stolen farms lay unproductive because no one wants to work them or are too stupid to know how.

Not quite the same thing. The blacks in Libya are guest workers or mercenary soldiers in a foreign country. Those who survive can be repatriated. The whites in SA are in their own country. They have nowhere to go, as the US and European countries will not recognize them as victims of persecution.
Long term, much worse.

You know that blurry eyed, mind is fuzzy phase when you first wake up.  That’s where they are now.  They only see what the MSM want them to see about Ron Paul.  They still are being spoon fed their information.  They are falling in line with the ‘Rick Perry is our man’ mantra being fed to them by the handlers. They will never see or know that Dr. Paul says what he says because he believes in the Constitution.  He wants to follow it to the letter.  That‘s the ONLY way we’ll get out of this mess but they don’t want to see that.  They are following the leader on this manufactured ‘War on Terror’ and swallowing the kool-aid that they hate us because we are free.  They HATE us because we come in and oust their leaders then place dictators of OUR choice in their place and remain as and occupying force for YEARS.  They use to have good relations with us.  They use to respect us for our stand on freedom of choice and religion.  USE to until we started trying to change their way of life.

For those that don‘t or won’t understand what Ron Paul is saying about “Talking” to the Islamic world.. here is the basis for his stance from their OWN mouths:
5. The West is “not serious about having a dialogue” with the Muslim Arab world.
Finally the conflicts continue because the West is not serious about dialogue.
A future look at cultural dialogue
Recently, a number of International conferences were held on the subject of cultural dialogue.
These attempts are based on the belief that dialogue – even if there is a clash – is not
impossible, even if the West – which is the strong side in the current equation in the conflict –
is not serious about conducting a dialogue… However, it is possible to spark a dialogue
which will be productive and fruitful in a several  ways, such as mutual financial business
relations, through which we could drive a political and cultural dialogue.

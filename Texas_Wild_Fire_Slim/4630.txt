Coverage
• Game story: Baylor overcomes No. 14 TCU in 50-48 thriller

• Notebook
• Full stats





That’s one small step for the Bears, and one giant leap for Baylor-kind.
Let’s be straight: Losing to 14th-ranked TCU in the season opener wouldn’t have been a season-killer for Baylor. It’s what the oddsmakers and even many Baylor fans expected.
That said, when you knock off the defending Rose Bowl champs in a nationally televised home game before a nearly full house of ecstatic, field-charging Baylor backers, it’s more than a strong season-starter.

It’s a season-maker. It’s an eye-opener. It’s the biggest win of the Art Briles Era, even larger than the Kansas State shootout of 2010, the game that pushed Baylor back into a bowl game for the first time in a generation.
Everyone expects you to beat K-State in your own house. Beating TCU is another matter altogether.
When it’s a 50-48 touchdown-a-palooza that will go down as one of the wildest games in Baylor football history, all the better.
Forget for a moment that some of TCU’s old studs like Andy Dalton and Jeremy Kerley were honorably discharged to the NFL. This was still a Horned Frog team that had won 25 straight regular-season games entering the night, a program that had led the nation in total defense for three years running.
This wasn’t TCUWho. This was TCYou- Betcha.
And that’s why for Baylor players and fans alike, it went down sweeter than a 100-yard backstroke through a river of Dr Pepper.
A year ago, it was a much different story. TCU pressured, harassed and pounded Robert Griffin and the Bears in a humbling 45-10 beatdown.
“Same old Baylor!” taunted a cadre of TCU fans, as Baylor’s players filed off the field after that game.
Not anymore. Same old Baylor?
Try brand new Baylor. Big bad Baylor.
From the start of the game, Griffin and the BU offense sliced through TCU’s vaunted defense like a machete through wet toilet paper. The Bears were creative. Kendall Wright showed that with a gorgeous touchdown pass to Terrance Williams for the first touchdown.
They were tough. None tougher than Terrance Ganaway, who plowed straight ahead into the teeth of the Frogs’ defense, topping 100 yards rushing before the clock hit halftime.

And they were precise. Griffin unloaded bombs with unflappable ease, placing them perfectly in the fingertips of his receivers, as if they were just 40-yard handoffs.
Still, it all seemed as if might unravel when TCU charged back with 25 fourth-quarter points. When Ross Evans kicked a go-ahead field goal with 4:27 to play, it  wasn’t the Frogs who were crying, “Same old Baylor!”
It was the grizzled Bear fans, who had seen this movie before.
Same old Baylor, crushing our hopes and dreams again.
But, in the end, the Bears showed that old Baylor was long gone. They mounted an impressive drive into TCU territory. Aaron Jones, the Stork, soared a clutch kick through the uprights.
Then Mike Hicks, a former high school receiver, came up with the game-clinching pick, just when the Bears needed it most.
They’ll remember this one for a long time.
It won’t be because of the national TV. It won’t be because of the revenge factor. It won’t even be because of the offensive fireworks. (Well, not completely).
It’ll be because they beat a darn fine football team.
Decades from now, they’ll recall this as the night big-time college football returned to Waco.
On the home side of the field.

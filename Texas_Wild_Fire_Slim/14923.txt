HOUSTON – After ten days, the devastating Riley Road Fire was 100 percent contained Wednesday, Texas Forest Service officials said.

The fire, which started on Sept. 5, has scorched nearly 19,000 acres in Waller, Montgomery and Grimes counties. It destroyed at least 76 structures and damaged 23 more.

The Texas Forest Service said over 10,500 acres burned in Waller, nearly 6,500 acres in Montgomery and nearly 2,000 acres in Grimes County.

Click here for an updated map of the Riley Road Fire.

“Fire activity on the Riley Road fire was light again today, Wednesday, as it has been for the past 4 days,” The TFS said on its website. “Fire crews have successfully moped up the entire 45-mile 
perimeter and there are very few hot spots remaining.” 

What’s more, firefighters finally got a little help from Mother Nature.

"A moist sea breeze came on shore again last night increasing the overnight relative humidity to 96 percent. This increase in moisture also helps to cool hot spots inside the fire," the TFS said. 

The TFS said residents reported a number of burning embers near their homes overnight, but firefighters responded quickly and said the embers were all within the fire line and posed no threat.

All evacuated residents in Waller County were allowed to return Wednesday.

In Montgomery County, officials opened all evacuated areas to residents on Monday.

In Grimes County, evacuation orders were still in place Wednesday for Lake Holly Hills, Mill Creek, Plantations Lakes, Saddle Creek, Country Line Estates and the area behind the Texas Renaissance Festival grounds, including Renfaire Drive, Tammy Circle, Devin Court and CR 303.
Evacuation centers were set up in all three affected counties.

In Montgomery County, a shelter was set up at the Wildwood Methodist Church, located at 8911 FM 1488.

In Grimes County, the Grimes County Expo Center was open to evacuees.

In Waller County, an evacuation center was established at the First Baptist Church in Hempstead, at 5th and Main Street.

The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

I guess is time to enforce tittering laws specially when some one has  thrown a lit cigarette but on the ground,  just go to any intersection and you'll find endless mounds of them.   time to get Houston cleaned up. start ticketing people for being plain pigs.

it's time to get the logging trucks off the roads - shown by yesterdays fire in trintiy county.
cars want to pass and take chances and sometimes meet one head on.
Cut the logging and maybe it will effect the coming major drought, started last October.

Hope this fire is soon just a bad memory.  I know  for the folks who lost their homes and belongings, you will be dealing with it for some time to come. Best of luck rebuilding your lives.  Many thanks to the tireless firefighters for all their efforts, and law enforcement for keeping people safe. Thoughts and prayers are with the communities affected. God bless.

I don't live in the area where the fires are, but I watched the news as well as the FB page that was set up.  I cried and prayed for these people as well as the fire fighters.   The fire fighters did a job that words can't not express other than saying Thank You.   I huge thank you goes out to all the volunteers as well as anyone else involved.

Wildland78: As a resident of Magnolia, I want to personally say thank you for your service. I was in the Brookshire Bros parking lot on Friday watching the smoke pumes get worse and worse. It was very scary and intense even where we stood, so I can only imagine how it must have been on the front lines. Thank you and the rest of the fire crews for getting the fires under control and for saving our beautiful community from burning to ruins. Continued prayers to my friends and coworkers who have been affected and for the rest of the community as well. God bless!

i am a firefighter who has been working the riley road fire for five days. for those who are complaining about the evacuations i have ths to say. I have been doing wildland fires for a long time and this one had me standing on my ears the majority of the time. I have not seen a fire change so quick and run so fast like this has. We are trained on what to look for and the sights and sounds of a fire changing direction and making a run. if the mandatory evacs had not happened there would have been a lot a fatalaties on this one. i pray for those who lost homes and belongings, but i can tell you this everyone of use who worked this fire gave 1000% to try and save everything we could. a lot of blood, sweat and tears were shed at this fire from the mean on the lines trying to stop this beast. GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF THE FIRE VICTIMS.

Blank, that's too funny. We did the same thing! We put in an alarm system in not to keep out theives but to keep the teenager daughter INSIDE!   That's too funny. Nothing like the "chirping" to let you know someone's trying to get out. lol Good times. Good luck, glad you're doing ok.

BTW, we're good on security, Daisy. We got an alarm system put in when a teen daughter started sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night. Not only was it good for a few laughs then, it works great and is on right now. We've never lost power during this crisis, but even then the batteries are good for a week. Plus, the few neighbors on our street that have stayed behind ("illegally") all have plenty of shotguns! (And they're probably bored by now, LOL.)

And what can they do to you? Arrest you? ridiculous.  I just home there's not going to be a problem with looters.  Can you imagine surviving the fire and then getting robbed? Ugh.  I went to HEB and they're also collecting for the fires to give to the Red Cross.  :)

Who authorized the government to forcibly evacuate you from your home and prevent your return? Stand up,ignore this government "protection" and defend your homes.Many have burned to the ground because the lawn caught fire and nobody was even there with a rake,a boot or even a garden hose to put it out.Freaking government says evacuate and the sheep will jump.

The main reason we aren't cutting down dead trees in Kingwood is that a spark from one chain saw or a tree falling on a power line is all it will take and POOF! we are gone. Better to wait.

@ Powfield & @ rebird182   Oh yeah I agree.  And now the winds are picking back up again, and that just makes if far worse.   I also heard as well this drought could go on until next spring.  The Woodlands is like setting on a time bomb.  I live around or near 20 miles south of the woodlands.  Even here we could have a problem.  I've stated this so many times, this whole deal could get so far worse before its over. And it want be over with unitl we get plenty of rain.

The Woodlands is a tinder box just waiting for someone to toss a cig. out the window and pooff, it could be all over for 100,000 homeowners and their familys.
Why they aren't cutting down all the dead trees and clearing out the dead underbrush is beyond me. It seems as least 1/2 of all the large oaks are dead and dying, as well as all the little trees and bushes. Tey said on the news today that this lack of rain could extend through next Spring.  Lake Conroe is drying up by a foot a week, which feeds Lake Houston it's drinking water.  Once that water is gone, no more water for the City of Houston.  I think it's time to start building a few large pipelines from the Mississippi River to Texas.  How about right beside the new gas pipelines they are already constructing.

I live in the Oak Hollow subdivision off FM 1488 (about 5 miles west of "downtown" Magnolia, in Waller County). I think Country Oak is quite a bit south of Magnolia if I remember correctly. Many people and authorities are doing facebook pages for timely updates. Google "Montgomery County Fire Watch" and you should get a link to that particular facebook page. Good luck. (But do take into consideration there are some idiots posting things...stick with posts from authorities.)

insman - They pulled it away from the California wildfires, from what I've read at other media sites.  Then it arrived, but federal laws required a mandatory rest period for the crew, before they could fly again.  Don't know about the Department of Agriculture cancelling contracts.

Does anyone know where the DC 10 came from and why hasn't it been used earlier?  I have read some articles about the dept of Agriculture cancelling a contract with the firm that owns and files the fire fighting planes that could have been used to fight the Texas fires.  Another branch of the government said they shouldn't have done so and there was nothing wrong with the planes.

Magni:   I read yesterday that they were turning away volunteer FFs (only) because they felt the volunteer FFs didn't have the bredth of  skills necessary to take on wild fires of this magnitude, and it was distracting the professional FFs by their having to divert attention to the volunteers.   Volunteer FFs are needed and appreciated -- but officials think the situation was so bad that (I hate saying this) the gainfully employed professional  FFs needed to focus. I read this, it is not my opinion.

Does anyone know why Waller Co. SO was denying firefighters entry into Waller County?   

Firefighters from the Riley Division were stopped and turned around at the county line by Waller Sherriff Deputies last night.  This was hear over the radio on the Montgomery CO Fire TAC West channel.

Thoughts and prayers go out to all who are affected by the fires.

Tree through my roof, water in my house, no power for SEVENTEEN days and all alone. We had groups of looters to watch for so I was even afraid to open my windows. Still imo is nothing like a raging fire headed right for you. I am more terrified of that than anything......We have much to pray for today. Floods, Drought, Fire and terriorist threats.......may God have mercy on us all.

I love spike's idea.  Wouldn't that be great? Chain them all together and send them out to redeem themselves. Works for me.  Blanken, glad to hear it.  I can't imagine the terror of it being so close and not knowing.  Reminds me of hurricane ike. I was SO nervous about the house/trees, etc.. I stayed up while everyone else slept like a baby. Son gets up, I ask him to just sit here with me, watch me sleep and let me know if anything happens, for an hour. The minute I went to sleep, he went back to bed. Woke up hours later. Ugh. Men!  lol  Hang in there, it will all be over soon hopefully.

Fire was really getting close to our street (a neighbor is still there, posting on facebook). There were water drops most of the night. Neighbor posted at 3:30am that all the frantic activity was dying down, he could see no flames, and was taking a catnap. Still can't relax, but at least we know as of right now, we still have a home. Will update you guys later. Thanks!

Why can't someone from the Waller County Sheriff Dept give updates directly to the citizens? Facebook the LARGEST Social Media w/500  million viewers. I would say that 75% of the Waller County Citizens (or children) have Facebook accounts & they could get 1st hand information directly from the officials in charge. 
As it is now, there is alot of speculation & false rumors created by citizens who  are desperately trying to find out what is happening. This is day 4, & the news media is still in Montgomery County where the fire is 80% contained & some evacutees are being allowed to return. What about MEDIA coverage for Waller County. There are over 3000  homes with families (avg 4 person each) evacuated since Monday & there is no media coverage or offical county site that has up-to-date information.

This ought to send a clear message to any potential businesses; investors or home buyers WHY NOT to invest in Waller County. Shame Shame on the Officials.

Just fyi, we donated at Randalls yesterday, - very easy, you can do it @ the checkout or they have a large donation box for cash donations. You can also donate online.  The money goes to Red Cross to aid our fellow Texans.  The cashier scans a code designating the donation to "neighbors in need" for Houston area wildfire victims.  They can put the money to use where it is most needed. God bless Texas.

If y'all are looking for volunteer or donation opportunities, we've updated the list again.  It's the related link on this story that says: "Donate to help Houston-area wildfire victims, firefighters" (Can't post the link here, because of our comment filter!)

@spike696969 you sound like a "professional" firefighter who just doesn't like the fact that the volunteers are taking away your jobs in the smaller communities.  Although I understand your feelings on this, I really don't suspect that the "professionals" do that much different of a job than the amateurs in this matter.

Yorkie, on the news yesterday, they asked people to only donate what they can use right now, like water, powerade, snacks, etc. Not clothes, etc because they don't have anywhere to house them.  There is a link on this site of what different organizations are requestings.  People can also donate via randalls.  Raveon, I went out with dogs last night, at 4am and again now at 7. It smells VERY strong now compared to those other times. The air is just toxic.  I hope they get a handle soon.  I also wish they would update all these reports of people saying that some of these are deliberate arson!!! wth?!

After Ike, going what I went thru, with my home damaged, no phones for 4 days, no electricity for a week, I decided I was leaving the area!  Went looking at property all over north of Houston...even went looking in Alabama, because the cost of living is about the same as here....Now I see I was looking at a house with property, right where all these fires are now devouring everything people have....glad I decided to stay where I am.  Trying to run from the wrath of Mother Nature is like getting divorced and remarried...just trading one set of problem for another....best to decide what you can and will tolerate, and stand your ground.

Driving home from work last night, we could see the smoke rising up in the sky from our travels on Hwy.249. Then the sun peeked through and it was a reddish orange color. Very pretty but at the same time eerie. People were stopping on the highway and in parking lots to look at it and take pictures. I hope they get this under control soon. I pray for the families and businesses and the wildlife that are losing so much in this mess. I have friends and family up in that area.

Let me go to the top and re-read the headline on this article....yes, I thought I was on the right page!! This is about all the fires and people desperate and loosing everything they own..As I was scanning down through some of the posts, to see if anyone had suggested drop off points for donations for these poor people! It is common sense to try to stay away from all the choas and activity where all the fires are.I wish SOMEONE would step up from those areas and maybe get a truck and drive to Houston..maybe set up several "pick up sources" at grocery stores...I cleaned out closets last night, and will be doing all the closets this weekend...I have several large bags of clothes that I want to send to these people...will have many more this weekend...also will go to my storage and get extra dishes and things from the lake house I sold....just need a way to get all this to Magnolia area...already sent stuff to Bastrop..trying to help.Maybe Red Cross can appear and help collect donations??

This is the result of volunteer fireman not knowing how to do their job,  now days we have a lot of volunteer everything!   volunteer pharmacist aka drug dealer,   volunteer doctor aka faith healer.    it's time for all these cities that are charging taxes from both individuals and businesses to pay for professional fireman that are not just cowboys looking forward to putting shining lights in their trucks.   this same thing happened in old Katy when a warehouse caught fire,  after it was put out it came back and totaled the structure!   and the volunteers couldn't be happier since they got to turn on their lights.

@ Daisymay   The first 2 years Obama was in Office he and the democrats were doing the Bailouts and Obamacare.  There is no Lesser of two evils that is a myth. That was thought of before and what did we get?  NO one is forcing you to go vote. Yes we deserve better. The problem is we just don't have it from both sides of the aisle.  I hate alot of things about Obama's policies and the fact he gives the GOP to much rope to hang him and this country. But I respect the fact OBL was killed under his watch time.  And that should have been taken care of way before Obama became president, and we wasted Billions plus lives doing something else.  And that took alot out of this country. Because of that we might have more resources to deal with the issues we are facing today these fires are an example.

@ DaisyMay  Obama and the democrats were doing the bailouts and Healthcare reform.  And voting for the lessers of two evils is a myth and don't work well either Bush was considered less evil than GORE. How did that work out yeah!! 9/11 and a war with a country that had nothing to do with 9/11. And the one who planned 9/11 went for the most wanted to forget it.   Yes we deserve better the problem is we just don't have that from BOTH sides of the aisle.

Blankenship: it's good to see you and your family are ok. :) oldgustav: you really are an April Fool.  Those articles about the cancellation of the space shuttle program was an April Fool's joke. The reason why the space program was cancelled was due to Obama's proposed budget to congress limiting the funding to NASA's space program, but enlarging other programs within NASA itself.

@ oldgustav   Some people just don't Care or understand about being informed to the facts.  In all do respect I don't care a whole lot about Obama's policies. But he is also dealing with a Congress. That rather bring him down and the country for political advantage.  And I believe people like DaisyMay are a politicians dream. They know they cannot remember yesterday. So that means they want bother to do any real research to get facts.  Take one example is cutting back on those services we need really going to get our country out of dept?? Example our first Responders like those that fight these fires, and etc..... According to the GOP it will help just as trickle down economics will create JOBs.

Got back in our house today. This was all so scary, 5 minutes to grab people and animals Monday at 6pm and get out. Our subdivision is right across the street (FM 1488) from Remington Forest, which they say is 90 percent gone. My kid used to walk over there to hang with friends. But we're all OK over here. Thanks to all my friends on this board for your concern and well-wishes. i know we don't always see eye-to-eye, but all you guys make me think, and occasionally even change my mind about something. :-) Plus, I get a lot of laughs (and big LOLs from you, Daisy).

Daisy Mae and SP5:
First of all isn't it the governors responsibility to first declare parts of the state as disaster areas then FEMA can assist.  Unfortunately I think Rick (who is an avowed hater of Washington and wanted Texas to seced from the US) is too stubborn to admit that. It would look like he's depending on Washington's Federal aid.

Secondly, look at the folks on the east coast that have been devestated with a earhtquake and a hurricane within a metter of weeks.  Eric Cantor has been quoted as saying before FEMA money is committed they need to find spending cuts to offset the money.  Now, let's see if Texas gets any money.  If we don't cantor is a good place to pin the rose.

@ DaisyMay   If you lost it on Obama over the shuttle deal that is not saying a whole lot.  And yes the next president will fix it all right by cutting more on our first responders while the wealthy in this country get the tax cuts. Kinda like we are doing now. This is where I have lost in on Obama by giving the GOP to much rope to hang this country on.  Texas is a conservative state we should not worry if we get federal assistance that is called Socialism.  Really we have NO leadership from both sides of aisle.  Meantime, all we can do is fight this mess best we can and hope  we get alot of relief in the form of rain. And it does not look like we can even get that.

Right,  don't I know it.  I'm guessing Texans won't get one red cent from this administration. If the voters of 2012 can't/won't see that, then we're all doomed.  He had absolutely no experience in gov yet they voted for him anyways. What did they think was gonna happen?  The icing on the cake for me, was the shuttle fiasco.  I hope the next president can "fix" it. In the meantime, what is he going to do for the fire victims? My guess is not much. Will see.

DaisyMay:  Who knows...I just read an e-mail about how the secret service agents, many of whom are obviously very close to the President, have felt  about the various presidents since Reagan.  The accompanying video is     from a retired U.S. Marshal.  Unfortunatley, for the public of the United States, this president is viewed as a sneaky, untrustworthy person.  I believe that says   quite a bit about a man and his wife of whom they have no trust either.  
Perry has a problem with the fires and trying to run for president.  Maybe        this will prove or disprove his capability for the office of President.   Afterall,
nobody is liked by everyone, right ??

I hate to sound negative. To those around the 1960 area on the northside of Houston.  Fires could break out around that area just as easy as these have. Looking at many the of pine trees and grass in the area they are either dying or dead.  And I believe most of us can agree with Old_Sp5 this is more devastating than a hurricane.  All we can do is keep praying for rain, becareful what we do outside and not spark any fires.  Be alert to power lines that maybe arcing and etc....  Meanwhile pray for the FF, and for those that have lost their homes. Also for those who have their homes but are afraid that they could lose their homes do to this tragic nightmare.

We're going to have that on here ASAP - as soon as we get the OK from the station  Also, we're putting together a list of other donation opportunites for the Houston fire victims and for the Bastrop fire right now..... We'll post it as a related link in this story and in the Seen on 11 NEws page and on Facebook here in the next few minutes.

Guv, let me give you some help.  How about activatinf the National Guard to assist?  How about military tankers to drop fire retardent just like in California? How about asking neighboring governors to send help?

As heroic as these VOLUNTEER firefighters and emergency workers are, they can't handle it on their own and they need help!

Where is our Governor.  Just like Nero fiddling when Rome burned, Perry is fiddling on the campaign trail while Texas burns.

His intervention is much too late.  1,000 homes, hundreds of thousands of acres burned and 2 deaths and NOW he humbles himself to ask for help.  Too little and too late.

I just had a co worker call in late because he is holding looters on his place at gun point in montgomery until the law shows up. I wonder how much more of this is going on.

Blank - Hang in there. Hope all is well when this thing is over. I delivered those dog crates, last night, for the kennel up there that had to evacuate. Pretty scary what's going on.

Spike, you're an idiot.  These aren't ranches, they're subdivisions with the word "ranch" in the name of the subdivision.

so the ranchers get a tax break for having a ranch,  how come they don't use the money they saved in taxes to cut down dried up brush and prevent such a disaster?

Yes, Ranch Crest has been hit from what I understand the Exxon blew up in front of the neighborhood. My prayers go out to all the families.

Does anyone have any updated news on the Ranch Crest subdivision? Has it been hit by the fire yet? Thank you for responding cause my family lives there and they were evacuated... have not heard anything yet and I am just checking. Our prayers are also with the families who have homes and loved ones there also. God be with us all. Thank you!

We're at a La Quinta in Houston right now...forced by the mandatory evacuations out of our home in Waller County, near Magnolia/Montgomery County at about 6pm, when brave men and women in blue went door to door to get us out. Hopefully, just a precaution.

@ OvertheRainbow   You and your neighbors will be in my prayers. I hope you can return home soon.  And glad to hear your side that it was not an explosion. Not happy to hear that your area is effected by this tragic event. Keep us posted.

HUGE Grass fire in Bastrop, TX. Below is a repost:

"URGENT NEED for horse transport for evacuation in Bastrop County,TX. Barns that were used to house evacuees are now in the fire's path. Rt 304 still open both ways. Anyone in the area who can help, please call Beth at 512-467-4893 or Rachel at 512-581-2940. There at least 43 horses in immediate need at their rescue, surely there will be more. **Please cross post!!**"

I was evacuated about 5:30 from a Grimes County subdivision.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't an explosion of any kind.  My neighbors and I watched it grow from a little tiny column of smoke to a raging inferno.

Amen Pancho! Most folks don't think about those babies. A friend of mine just called and has me on standby to help evacuate the dog kennel she is caring for. May be taking a load of crates up to her soon.

@badlandsbabe  Your daughter maybe right on how this started.  Regardless on what is stated in this  article.  Now its just more bad fire news we need to worry about.  According to the latest weather data they have no idea when we will see rain. And even at that it would not be enough Texas needs some serious rain like ASAP.

My daughter, who lives in Magnolia said this fire was started by a gas pipeline explosion. Article doesn't mention that. Is it true?

Mexican local police battered in drug warAP – 16 hrs ago





MEXICO CITY (AP) — President Felipe Calderon says Mexico's local police forces have been battered during the country's nearly five-year offensive against drug cartels.Calderon says drug gangs corrupted and infiltrated many municipal police forces, and that success in the drug war won't come until local police and prosecutors' offices are cleaned up and made more effective.Calderon says local police in the violence-wracked northern border state of Tamaulipas have basically been replaced by the armed forces.Calderon spoke Wednesday, the same day the Defense Department said that soldiers killed four suspects in a gunfight in the western state of Nayarit.Nayarit has been the scene of cartel turf battles.

If drugs werent in such high demand in the u.s. then we wouldnt have this problem. We have the largest population of drug addicts in the world. Alot of Americans are in denial of this fact. My fellow Americans, the problem is not only Mexico or Colombia, its us as well.

For all those who think legalizing drugs would solve anything, guess again, do you really believe the cartels would then become model citizens and get a real job? they would lower their prices on drugs (why pay tax if you don't have to?) continue to smuggle humans, kidnap, extortion etc. nothing would change, it's their mentality.
Our only hope is to deport all illegals, seal our borders and let Mexico deal with their own citizens.

If cocaine grew on the the North Pole instead of in Columbia, then Canada would be experiencing the same problems as Mexico is right now.  Mexico happens to be in the unfortunate position of being between Colombia (supplier) and the USA (consumer). 

It is time to legalize the drugs - as long as drugs are illegal there will always be a black market. It is the only way to put these drug dealers and all the gangs that go with them out of business.  You just can't win this war.  All you do is cause the price of drugs to go up because it is harder to smuggle them in.  Higher prices just create more incentives for more people to become traffickers.

Even if you sealed the border with Mexico completely, drug traffickers will simply find another route to get the drugs into the USA - probably through Florida like they preferred in the past.

here is how i look at it, America will go and try to save Iraq, a land that hated America for years, Mexico don't harbor terrorist like Iraq and afghan does. the hardest part of life is at them borders. instead of #$%$ at Mexico, this American president should help the real people in trouble, not some American hating Taliban who are killing Americans now..and really, if you fake racist typers were really #$%$ racist, then you wouldn't send your white American kids there to party all the time...

legalize pot, to legalize the hard stuff is just plain stupid, it would create another entire sub-culture of junkies who wll stll commit crimes to get their fix, not to mention the addicts we already have

Legalize pot, it will deal a major blow to the cartels (financially), and stimulate our economy.

Ron Paul is the only candidate that is in favor of legalizing all drugs.  This policy would put all of the cartels and their gang members out of business.  It is impossible to win a war on drugs because as long as there is US demand, then there will be a market for suppliers. We should legalize drugs for PRACTICAL reasons like we did alcohol.  People who take drugs today, can get them even though drugs are illegal.  

All that money that is wasted on the drug war can be diverted to help educate our young people about the dangers of drugs.  Plus, it will put cartels out of business and Mexico will become a great place to take a vacation again.

I say LEGALIZE but don't legitimize.  Make people sign a paper when they buy them like this: "I KNOW THIS DRUG MIGHT KILL ME OR DESTROY MY LIFE AND I UNDERSTAND THE RISKS".

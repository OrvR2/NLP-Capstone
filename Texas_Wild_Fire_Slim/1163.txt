WASHINGTON -- Two new polls released on Tuesday confirm that the summer's debt ceiling debate along with the drumbeat of bad economic news have taken a toll, yielding all-time low ratings of both President Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress and suggesting real peril for Obama in 2012. Obama's ratings are now lower than those for Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton at the same time in their presidencies.
The latest survey from the Washington Post and ABC News finds approval of Obama has fallen to 43 percent, while for the first time a majority (53 percent) disapproves. The results from the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll finds nearly identical results -- 44 percent approve and 51 percent disapprove. The low ratings confirm downward trends seen in most other public polls over the summer. 

As the Washington Post notes, Obama's ratings are now worse than those of Reagan and Clinton at the same time in their first terms. Both won re-election despite "serious midterm setbacks" in their first terms, but by this stage both "had settled safely above the 50 percent mark" and "stayed in positive territory" throughout their re-election campaigns.
The two surveys also show plunging confidence in Congress. The NBC/Journal poll finds approval of Congress falling to 13 percent, just one point shy of the all-time low measured by that survey in October 2008. The ABC/Post survey shows approval of Republicans in Congress dropping from 34 to 28 percent since April, nearly matching the all-time low of 25 percent in July 2008. 
These levels of disapproval coincide with plunging confidence in the economy and in the Obama administration's efforts to turn it around: 

Both polls show only one American in five feels that the nation is "headed in the right direction," while both show roughly three out of four say that the country is "off on the wrong track."
Both surveys give Obama some of his weakest marks on the economy, with between 59 and 62 percent expressing disapproval of his handling of the economy or jobs.
The ABC/Post poll finds only 17 percent of Americans believe that Obama's economic program is making the economy better, while most say it is either having no effect (47 percent) or making the economy worse (34 percent). 
The NBC/Journal poll shows just 22 percent believe that the economy is getting better, the lowest level of the Obama presidency. Most think it is either getting worse (30 percent) or will stay the same (47 percent) over the next 12 months. 

Falling economic confidence stems in part from the unending news about stagnant job growth and an unemployment rate stuck at just over 9 percent. However, the two surveys yield evidence that the summer's debt ceiling debate also helped drive down confidence. The NBC/Journal poll, for example, finds just 6 percent with a favorable opinion of the way "the budget negotiation that took place in Washington was handled," while 71 percent have an unfavorable opinion.
The same poll also shows sharply declining confidence in Obama's leadership qualities and ability to achieve goals, a result consistent with findings from the recent Pew Research Center survey. 
The only real silver lining for Democrats in the results is that Americans remain deeply divided when asked to choose between Obama and the Republicans. For example, the ABC/Post poll finds Americans divided on whether Obama or congressional Republicans can better handle the economy and job creation. 
Similarly, the NBC/Journal poll finds Obama running five percentage points ahead of Texas Gov. Rick Perry (47 to 42 percent) among registered voters and just one point behind former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (45 to 46 percent). But the president's standing is slightly worse when the same poll asks not about specific opponents, but whether voters will support Obama or "the Republican candidate." On that question, Obama trails by four points (40 to 44 percent). 
Obama's personal ratings do remain strong. In the NBC/Journal poll, for example, 70 percent say they like him personally (although nearly half of those who like Obama also say they disapprove of many of his policies). But the president's political position remains perilous. As Democratic pollster Peter Hart puts it simply to NBC News, "Obama is no longer the favorite to win re-election." 
UPDATE: 4:52 p.m. -- The statement by the Washington Post that the job approval ratings of presidents Reagan and Clinton "had settled safely above the 50 percent mark" at this point in their presidencies is based on ABC News/Post polls conducted in 1983 and 1995. Polls conducted by the Gallup organization, however, show both presidents receiving ratings that fell just under 50 percent. According to Gallup.com, Reagan and Clinton had job approval ratings of 47 and 44 percent, respectively, 954 days into their first terms. The comparable Gallup rating for Obama was 42 percent (for the week of Aug. 29 to Sept. 4).

                        Well finally we have reached a pinnacle. Americans are now ready to send all congress members home in the next election. They never expected us to stick together and have made careers on dividing us. Both congress and the WH realize the economy is in shambles and we the people who they refer to as average Americans aren't too average.-That we won't be supporting their efforts to victimize us

 after the banking sector victimizat­ion to beat us out of our SS money we paid into the system from our paychecks.-That we won't be consumer spending to "get us out of this" while the wealthiest Americans pay little or nothing.-That we will stick together until the many Americans who are out of work find jobs.As for Obama, when he stated all was on the table he didn't realize his job was too along with his cronies in Congress. Throwing SS & Medicare on the table was the biggest mistake and defined his presidency­. Defining there was nothing he wasn't willing to do. Big difference in what you had to do or would be willing to do. He betrayed his base and proved himself as being non-loyal.  After all, who would be ignorant enough to support a president that doesn't support them?

				America's Sick Economy
By Stephen Lendman
9-7-11

Sooner or later the usual pundits and "experts" showing up on tout TV will buckle and admit what honest analysts have been saying all along:

America's economy is sick and getting sicker. Since 2008, working households have struggled through the early stages of a protracted global depression­, getting worse.

While corporate profits recovered, workers experience­d growing poverty, homelessne­ss, hunger, and high unemployme­nt.

At the same time, barely more than crumbs were offered for help. Now ended, austerity cuts are coming, not vitally needed stimulus, including an effective job creation program. More on that below.

In times of trouble, alcohol consumptio­n increases. In fact, Bloomberg News said it's soaring. So are lottery ticket sales, according to USA Today and firearms purchases at a time more people either feel scared or very uneasy.

The latest consumer confidence survey shows why. The Economist called it "dreadful with the headline figure falling to a two-year low." It's similar to a late August EU measure, showing sentiment "experienc­ing its biggest fall since December 2008."

The dismal jobs picture explains. Economist David Rosenberg called August report "horrible.­" So did economist and regular Progressiv­e Radio News Hour contributo­r Jack Rasmus in his latest article headlined, "August Jobs Report - Worse Than Zero," saying:

These corporatio­ns only poll about 1,000 American adults which is less than 10,000th of 1% !  They never give political, demographi­c, ethnic or financial informatio­n about the people being polled.  Why don't the pollsters try giving us ALL of the facts and statistics for a change.

				I just figured out what the biggest issues that have created OBAMA'S recent decline in the polls .... The people that put these polls on are asking the wrong questions to the wrong people.  I think Obama should force to pollster's to be more prudent in there selection of questionin­g and who they question.  They (the pollsters) aren't being fair enough to OBAMA and the truth is in the way you present it. Obama was set up by the Republican­s and its not his fault that the economy he is running isn't working.  And now the pollsters are picking on him !

Liberal moment is over ~ Just kidding ~ Obama is/was above his pay grade even before he was elected and failure was his only option !

We do wish you the best in your future endeavors, but please step aside so that somebody else can TAKE RESPONSIBI­LITY for our economy and lead us without BPBing (Blaming President Bush), or blaming the tsunami for their lack of leadership and poor decisions.
Best wishes to you in the future Mr. Obama, and we look forward to seeing you competing with Clinton on the ex-Preside­nt speech giving circuit!

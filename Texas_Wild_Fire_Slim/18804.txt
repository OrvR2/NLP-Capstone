Vetting explained


                                iReport is a user-generated section of CNN.com. The stories in this section are not edited,
                                fact-checked or screened before they are posted.
                            

What does the label "not vetted by CNN" mean?
                                The label “Not vetted by CNN” lets you know that this story hasn’t been both checked and cleared by a CNN editor.
                            

What does "vetted" mean?
                                iReport stories that have a red "CNN iReport" stamp in the corner have been vetted and
                                cleared. That means they've been selected and approved by a CNN producer to use on CNN,
                                on air, or on any of CNN's platforms.

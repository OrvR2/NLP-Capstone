Tropical Storm Lee lurches ashore in LouisianaBy MARY FOSTER - Associated Press | AP – Sun, Sep 4, 2011

Tropical Storm Lee crawled onto southern Louisiana's …more  coast on Sunday as New Orleans prepared for one of the biggest tests of its flood defenses since Hurricane Katrina devastated the city in 2005. The National Hurricane Center said the slow-moving storm could dump up to 20 inches of rain from the central Gulf Coast northward into the Tennessee Valley through Sunday and cause extensive flooding and flash flooding.

(AP) — The center of Tropical Storm Lee stretched across the central Gulf Coast early Sunday, dumping torrential rains that threatened flooding in low-lying communities in a foreshadowing of what cities further inland could face in coming days.Lee's center crawled ashore in Louisiana before dawn after the vast, soggy storm system spent hours during the weekend hovering in the northernmost Gulf of Mexico. The storm's slow crawl to the north gave more time for its drenching rain bands to pelt a wide swath of vulnerable coastline, raising the flood threat.By Sunday, at least 6 to 10 inches of rain had fallen in some spots along the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts, and the National Weather Service warned there was a threat of extensive flooding and flash floods because of the storm's slow, meandering jog inland.The drenching rain bands were expected to head northward into the Tennessee Valley later in the week as forecasters warned that 10 to 15 inches of rain were possible along the central Gulf Coast and up to 20 inches in isolated spots.National Hurricane Center specialist Robbie Berg said the flash flood threat could be more severe as the rains moves from the flatter Gulf region north into the rugged Appalachians.Closer to the Gulf, the water is "just going to sit there a couple of days," he said. "Up in the Appalachians you get more threat of flash floods — so that's very similar to some of the stuff we saw in Vermont."Vermont is still cleaning up and digging out dozens of communities that were damaged and isolated by heavy rain from Hurricane Irene last week that quickly overfilled mountain rivers.No injuries were reported so far from Lee. But even before Lee swept ashore, there were scattered instances of water entering low-lying homes and businesses in Louisiana's bayou country — a region of fast-eroding wetlands long vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms. The storm prompted evacuations in bayou towns such as Jean Lafitte. Thousands were without power.Late Saturday, lifelong Jean Lafitte resident Brad Zinet was riding out the storm in his mobile home mounted on pilings. He was hoping it wouldn't take on water."We got nowhere to go. We're just getting everything put up out of the way and hope for the best," said the 31-year-old plumber."This is a way of life around here," he added. "You just do the best you can and ride it out."A week after Hurricane Irene caused massive flooding and claimed at least 46 lives as it barreled up the East Coast, President Barack Obama was heading to northern New Jersey later Sunday for a first-hand look at the damage while keeping an eye on Lee.The president was to visit Paterson, N.J., where the Passaic River swept through the once-booming factory town of 150,000, flooded its downtown and forced hundreds to evacuate.At 8 a.m. EDT, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Lee's center had come ashore on the Louisiana coast about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Lafayette. Maximum sustained winds were 45 mph (75 kph) as the storm headed to the north at 3 mph (5 kph).Tropical storm warnings stretched from near the Louisiana-Texas state line to Destin, Fla.Although Lee's expected to weaken in coming days, the system was expected to unleash heavy rains over a wide area of the central Gulf Coast and then spread that precipitation into the Tennessee Valley, forecasters said.To the east, coastal businesses were suffering. Alabama beaches that would normally be packed for the Labor Day holiday were largely empty, and rough seas closed the Port of Mobile. Mississippi's coastal casinos, however, were open and reporting brisk business.In New Orleans, sporadic downpours caused some street flooding Saturday, but pumps were sucking up the water and sending it into Lake Pontchartrain. Officials said the levees were doing their job in the city that is still recovering from the deadly Hurricane Katrina a half decade ago.New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu warned residents not to let their guard down, saying: "We're not out of the woods. Don't go to sleep on this storm."To the east, coastal Mississippi officials were bracing for the storm to move further into the state. "We've been getting some pretty good onshore rains," said Jackson County emergency director Donald Langham.Harrison County officials said travel on U.S. Highway 90 had become hazardous because winds from Lee have pushed sand from beach onto the eastbound lanes and the rain has created a situation where drivers cannot see the roadway."This layer of sand has gotten up on the highway and you can't determine if you're on the road, up on the median or the curb," said emergency director Rupert Lacy.Flooding in Hancock County left several roadways impassable, and the rain on parts of Interstate 10 at times has been so heavy that visibility was down to only a few feet.In Alabama, rough seas forced the closure of the Port of Mobile. Pockets of heavy rain pounded the beaches Saturday, and strong winds whipped up the surf and bowed palm trees. But just a couple miles inland, wind and rain dropped significantly.Wet and windy conditions hovered over Dauphin Island, a barrier island in the Gulf, but conditions weren't too threatening, Mayor Jeff Collier said. High surf caused some roads to flood, but all were still passable Saturday afternoon.Precautions were taken to secure anything that could be swept away by wind or waves, and Labor Day concerts and other festivities were canceled. Beaches that would normally be packed were nearly empty."The weekend is literally a wash," Collier said. "It's really a shame that it happened on a holiday weekend."Elsewhere, the National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Katia was trekking across open ocean about 365 miles (587 kilometers) northeast of the Northern Leeward Islands. No coastal watches or warnings were in effect with the storm so far out to sea.The center said Katia had top sustained winds of 75 mph (121 kph) and was moving at 12 mph (19 kph) with little change in recent hours.___Associated Press writers contributing to this report were Kevin McGill and Brian Schwaner in New Orleans; Jack Elliott Jr. in Jackson, Miss.; Jim Van Anglen in Gulf Shores, Ala.; and Kate Brumback in Atlanta.

I live in California, AKA earthquake country.  I don't live in a stilt house or on the 5th-Floor of a very, very old building.  It's called taking precautions.

Why live in Louisiana in the New Orleans area?  I love the history and culture out there but if you want to stay there, don't be so freaked-out if the levee's break and New Orleans gets flooded again.  Out here in California, we get some torrential rain storms that cause houses to fall down cliffs, usually near the beaches.  The owners cry, whine, and talk about how they just love their homes, etc.  I don't really feel bad for them.  They know the risks.

I see Obama is on the east coast giving away money to the rich while he lets the blacks  go unnoticed again in LA.  He's a 2 faced crooked lying SOB who needs to be replaced, in fact place him next to Bin Laden and make fish bait out of this bottom feeding a$$hole.

My whole life I have had alot of rain in different places at one time or another.  This is almost like reporting that refrigerators make ice.  Absolutely ridiculous to make anything of it but the Obama mania media need to sensationalize anything to distract you from the fact Obama is a complete failure.  They want you to think Obama is in charge and will take care of you in every crisis.  It is the opposite. Every single policy is designed to destroy the economy, make us live a life of servitude, and basically steal money from those who have lived the American dream and worked very hard to build their wealth and give it to others who could care less about earning it.  The whole point of the American dream was that you could be anything you wanted to be, work as hard as you want, earn all you want and not have someone come steal it from you.  It has nothing to do with race.  In fact, the slave owners and the KKK were actually the democrats.  It was the republicans that set them free. Obama is a piece of sheit and a poor excuse for an American.  In fact he hates America and does not believe it's institutions.  Wake up people and vote him out or you will not have a country left and we all be living in poverty.  Do you like Cuba or Haiti?

18년 전에 한국과 미국의 목사와 전도사라는 살인학살자 년들과 놈들 그리고 각 tv와 라디오 방송국의 프로듀서와 제작진들 그리고 연예인들과 MC 또한 아나운서들과 앵커들 그리고 정치인들과 대통령들 또한 기자들과 방송국들의 살인학살 강도의 년들과 놈들이 미국의 살인학살자 년들과 놈들을 그대로 흉내를 내며 압부를 떨고 직권남용의 국가보안법들로 24시간 교대로 저질러 오고 있는 살인학살의 만행들의 범죄들과 범행들이다. 

안기부 x파일과 국정원 x파일에 관한 근거의 뉴스 기사들을 확인들을 해 보면 쉽게 이해가 갈 것이다. 

18년 전, 1994년 10월과 1995년 초에 (면목동, 남양주, 일산 건영 아파트, 수유리) 24시간 살인학살의 고문들과 강탈들 그리고 파괴들을 저지르며 기독교 라디오 방송국의 주파수를 하나 따로 내어서 24시간 살인학살의 강도의 만행들의 범죄들과 범행들을 저지르며 성경의 말씀들을 악용들을 하여서 거짓들과 모함들의 조작들로 범행의 방송들을 내 보내며 자신들의 상상을 초월을 하는 살인학살의 강도의 짓들과 범죄들 그리고 범행들을 숨기고 완전범죄를 저지른다고 하며 감히 신의 종이신 프로펫 이 님을 미쳤다고 하며 마귀가 씌었다고 하는 저질에 악질에 범행의 방송들을 내 보내고 나중에는 MBC FM 라디오 팝송 프로그램에 목사라고 하는 남자 놈이 기어 나와서 ‘신의 종인 프로펫 이 님을 도와 주려고 했는데 이제는 어쩔 수가 없다’며 거짓의 조작들로 합리화를 시키며 숨어서 24시간 살인학살의 고문들과 테러들 그리고 강탈들과 파괴들은 물론이고 생체실험들을 저질러 오고 있다. 

KBS 1 한국 방송국 ‘아침 마당’ 프로그램에 진행을 맡고 있던 이상벽이라는 살인학살자 놈이 프로그램 진행 중에 연예인들을 모아 놓고 ‘미국에서는 존경을 받고 엄청난 존재인 프로펫 이 가 한국에서 저렇게 미쳐서 돌아 있으니 .... 쯪쯪쯪’ 라는 아가리를 두서도 없이 끼어 넣기 방송식으로 지껄이고 아는 사람들이 그렇게 생각을 하도록 유도를 했다. 
지금 그 근거의 방송 프로그램들을 숨기기 위해서 악법인 방송법 중에 3개월 지난 것은 파기를 하고 없앤다는 말도 안되는 아가리를 지껄이며 일반 사람들에게 공개를 하지 않고 있다. 이승만 정권 전부터인 일제시대 부터 기록 자료들이 넘쳐나는 상황에서 말이다. 

24시간 교대로 살인학살의 학대와 혈압을 올리는 고문들을 잔인하게 저지르며 자칭 목사라고 하는 미국의 밑바닥의 양갈보도 못되는 안달을 치는 저질에 한국의 사형수 놈이 성경의 말씀들을 악용들을 해가며 갖은 조작의 범죄들과 범행들로도 모자라서 나중에는 자신들의 살인학살의 범죄들과 범행들이 신의 뜻이라는 악질에 아가리를 지껄이고 살인학살의 고문들과 범죄들을 저지르고 있는 년들 그리고 놈들과 같이 우리 함께 기도를 합시다 해가며 예수님의 이름으로 아멘 이라는 범행들을 살인학살의 주파수 무기로 감히 신의 종이신 프로펫 이 님을 우롱을 하며 내 보냈다. (1995년 일산 건영 아파트) 

CBS와 극동아세아 기독교 라디오 방송국의 살인학살자 년들 그리고 놈들과 같이 (프로듀서, 제작진, MC, 프로그램 진행자, 행정직원, 목사, 전도사, 기자, 아나운서, 앵커, 집사, 크리스찬, 장로, 특히 방송국 밑바닥에서 출세를 한다고 하며 나이도 어린 것이 악질에 살인학살의 만행들을 24시간 저질러 오고 있는 한국 암컷 년 1마리 그리고 모조리 다) 24시간 교대의 살인학살의 강탈과 파괴들의 범행들과 범죄들을 밑바닥의 미국의 살인학살자 년들 그리고 놈들에게 아부를 떨며 저지르고 미국과 한국의 살인학살자 년들 그리고 놈들이 같이 악질에 살인학살의 범죄들과 범행들을 의논들을 해가며 ‘우리가 프로펫 이 政演 , Prophet Yi , David of JESUS 에게 지불을 해야만 하는 돈들이 많으며 진실이 밝혀지고 걸리게 되면 우리는 모조리 다 끝장이니, 이러한 상황에서도 신의 말씀대로 어려운 사람들을 돕는다고 하고 있는 “프로펫 이“와 그의 가족들을 더 잔인하게 찢어서 발겨 죽이며 그 돈들로 밑바닥의 악질에 살인자 년들과 놈들을 고용을 하여서 출세를 시켜주며 완전범죄로 더럽고 잔인하게 학살을 해서 완전범죄로 죽이자! 그러면 우리는 우리의 죄악에서 벗어 날 것이며 우리가 프로펫 이 에게 지불을 해야만 하는 돈들은 없어지는 것이며 오로지 강탈과 파괴들을 하며 신의 종이라고 하는 프로펫 이를 우리가 원하는 대로 개와 돼지보다 못하게 학대해서 가지고 놀며 악하게 이용을 하여서 사용을 하고 지옥에 비교도 안되는 학대와 학살의 억울함들의 고통들 속에 미치게 하여서 악질로 학살해서 죽이면 일거양득이다.’ 라고 하며 미국과 한국의 살인학살자 년들 그리고 놈들이 같이 가장 밑바닥의 한국의 살인학살자 년들과 놈들을 고용들을 하고 살인학살의 학대와 혈압을 올리는 고문들을 교육까지 시키며 18년이 넘는 지금까지 24시간 3시간 간격의 교대로 살인학살의 만행들의 범죄들과 범행들을 저질러 오고 있다. 그것들이 바로 내가 말을 하고 있는 자칭 ‘망원’ (Mang Won) 들이다.

In my opinion President Obama should have never been elected to office.  Ever since he became president things have gotten steadly worse.  What's wrong with people?  Have we become so ignorant and lazy that no one wants to look closely at the agendas of people running for office.  We take their words, and act like sheep being hearded by a few people in office, without getting to the root of things.  Come on people WAKE UP & smell the coffee.  If Obama gets re-elected then people will be in deep doo-doo.  That smells fishy to me.

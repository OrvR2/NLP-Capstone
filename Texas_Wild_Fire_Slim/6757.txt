Perry withstands scrutiny, spirited exchanges with Republican rivals, in debateBy Holly BaileySenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey | The Ticket – 8 hrs ago

Romney and Perry (Mike Carlson/AP)In some ways, it was a night of political déjà vu.
In their second face-off in less than a week, Rick Perry and Mitt Romney kicked off Monday night's Republican presidential debate in Florida just as they did last week's forum in New Hampshire, with a spirited debate over the future of Social Security.
Perry opened his remarks with a noticeably softer tone toward the program, which he had previously described as a "Ponzi scheme" and a "miserable failure." This time out, the Texas governor insisted that he's not trying to take away the program from millions of Americans who depend on it for their monthly retirement checks.
"First off, the people who are on Social Security today need to understand something: Slam dunk, guaranteed, that program is going to be there in place" for people currently on Social Security, Perry insisted. "Those individuals that are moving towards being on Social Security, that program's going to be there for them when they arrive there."
But Romney wasn't about to let Perry's previous comments slide. He pressed Perry on his rhetoric, calling it "over the top and unnecessary and frightful to many people."
Perry, in turn, accused Romney of "trying to scare seniors," to which Romney quickly retorted, "The term 'Ponzi scheme' and talk of making it a state program is what scared seniors."
On the issue of whether the Social Security should be a state or federal program, the Texas governor interjected, "We ought to have that conversation."
"We're having that right now, governor. . . .We're running for president," Romney shot back.
You can watch the back and forth here, courtesy of CNN:

The exchange set the tone for much of the night. Perry's rivals aimed to chip away at the Texas governor's status as the race's current frontrunner. Among other things, Romney and Paul took aim at Perry's record on jobs in Texas while Jon Huntsman accused Perry of making a "treasonous" comment about the nation's lax border security.
In one of the other key exchanges of the night, Michele Bachmann (and later Rick Santorum) slammed Perry for his 2007 executive order requiring Texas schoolgirls to be vaccinated against HPV, a sexually transmitted disease that has been proven to cause cervical cancer.
Perry has repeatedly apologized for the order—and did so again tonight, calling it a "mistake."
"What was driving me obviously was making a difference in young people's lives," Perry said. "Cervical cancer is a terrible way to die."
But Bachmann slammed the Texas governor, questioning whether he was motivated by the idea of preventing cancer or if he was motivated by lobbying from the drug's producer, Merck.
The Minnesota congresswoman noted that a former chief of staff for Perry became one of Merck's top lobbyists in Texas and suggested that the governor steered the vaccination contract in exchange for a $5,000 donation.
"Was this about life? Or was it about million of dollars and potential billions for a drug company?" Bachmann demanded.
"It was a $5,000 contribution that I had  received from them," Perry replied. "I raise about $30 million. If you're  saying I can be bought for $5,000, I'm offended."
It was the best political moment in weeks for the Minnesota congresswoman, who has struggled for attention ever since Perry joined the race last month. Bachmann's campaign had cast Monday's debate as a moment when their candidate would regain momentum.
The HPV issue is sure to play big with evangelicals and other social conservatives—especially in the first-caucus state of Iowa. But was unclear whether the exchange would help Bachmann to regain her status as a frontrunner in the GOP primary race, which has been dominated by the Romney vs. Perry showdown in recent weeks.
Indeed, Bachmann still struggled for attention at the debate, which was sponsored by CNN and the Tea Party Express.  Until the debate's final half hour, Bachmann was largely overshadowed, even by rivals Huntsman, Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich—who received more questions tonight than in past debates.
Gingrich offered his best debate performance, at one point shifting the back and forth away from Romney and Perry's squabbles and to Republican attempts to defeat President Obama—which earned him enthusiastic applause from the tea party audience.
But it was Perry who seemed to face the most intensive scrutiny. Perry clearly seemed prepared for some of the questioning, including on Social Security, but he seemed a bit more ill at ease than he did during last week's New Hampshire debate. As his rivals fielded questions, the camera caught Perry looking toward the ceiling or fidgeting—a very different body language than that exhibited by Mitt Romney, who stared at his opponents as they answered questions.
But it's hard to say if Romney or other rivals did anything to derail Perry's steady rise in the polls. Only once did the crowd boo the Texas governor--and that was when Perry defended a law he passed in Texas that gave children of illegal immigrants access to in-state tuition at Texas universities, a measure that later inspired the federal DREAM Act backed by President Obama.
As the audience jeered, Perry insisted his legislation simply helps illegal immigrants become "contributing members of our society, rather than be on the dole."
"If you've been in the state of Texas for three years, and working toward citizenship, you pay in-state tuition," Perry declared. "It doesn't matter what the sound of your last name is. That's the American way."

To watch them attack each other shows me how immature they all are.  Not one of them can be the bigger man or women and focus on what their goals are to help Amercia.   They act like a bunch of children fighting for the top we don't leaders that are that immature and selfesh!

Texas has to be embarressed again. How is it that they elect men that come across unintelligent cannot speak well using the English language make faces on the stage. The only thing Rick Perry has done for Texas is to line his own pockets, gotta give him credit for that , he took the folks who elected him for a ride.. As far as the jobs he took credit for, they are minimum wage and for illegal aliens. The high paying jobs came from the cities who gave huge tax cuts to the business who brought them, look closely at Plano not Rick Perry.

Don't let the media corral you into believing that a certain candidate whom THEY don't support, is unelectable despite his popularity.  
If you don't know who I'm talking about then the media has succeeded in manipulating you.

Whoever wins, the GOP establishment is going to have a devil of a time trying to make that person electable. 
Romney breaks down companies, laying off employees and causing the companies' inevitable collapse while reaping exorbitant management fees, for the privilege of being destroyed by Romney, I suppose.
Perry is essentially W. Bush model 7.0. His inability to regulate the things coming out of his mouth would make good comedian fodder, though, if elected. But that's hardly likely, people are still mad at Bush for the state of the economy. Yeah, Obama hasn't done much to improve the situation, but Americans aren't dumb enough to just put a broken modem back in place simply because the new one is working more slowly than anticipated.
Huntsman is clever, and bright--but cannot possibly gain the support of the Republican base, because he's too rational.
Ron Paul is marginalized and sometimes even demonized by all facets of the American media, and does himself few favors with his lack of eloquence, and exuberant personality when he opens his mouth.

I regrettably voted for obama in 2008 and that will NOT happen again. Ron Paul looks the best to me by far!

I have been leaning toward Rick Perry but I cannot support anyone who wants to provide government aid to illegals.  The only aid illegals should receive is a free one way ticket back to their home.

Did you get a look at all of the fat trolls in the elite handpicked white audience?  All of them cheering when they talked about someone dying because they may not be able to pay for healthcare.  Yes sir, the cream of the crop….real Americans there.  

Note:  I did see one token black man strategically seated behind Wolf’s head.  They probably let him stay after he set up the stage.

Democrats and Independents should vote for Ron Paul in the Republican primary. We can control the republican elections in that way.

Hopefully the rest of the U.S. will find out what we here in Texas already know.... Rick Perry is a liar, a fraud and a jerk. I just hope the rest of the Nation doesn't think all of us Texans are like him.

Apparently Ron Paul wasn't there. Oh yeah that's right the media is barred from mentioning his name, I had forgotten. But I haven't forgotten that I'm voting for him so you media Nazis can kiss my #$%$

After reading the article, one would have never know that Ron Paul was even in the debate.  The less coverage the media gives the man, the more and more I am convinced he is the best candidate for President.

The only real life answers come from Ron Paul. Sorry but he tells the truth.

Obummer without a teleprompter: "We can solve the energy crisis by inflating tires more. We can save money in healthcare with doctors e-mailing each other more. A good way to help the economy would be to outlaw ATM machines to create more jobs. We can call in the undead army, the Navy corpse-men, to win in Afghanistan." This guy is a completely unqualified and inept FRAUD. No talented speech writers and no teleprompter? No hero worship and no Presidency.

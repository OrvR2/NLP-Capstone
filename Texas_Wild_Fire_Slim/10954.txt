Urlacher leaves Bears to be with family after mother’s passing By      Doug Farrar



Chicago Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher(notes) has left the Chicago Bears for an open-ended period of time to be with his family following the unexpected passing of his mother, 51-year-old Lavoyda Lenard, who died Monday, according to a statement released by the team.
No other information has been given as to the reason for her death, and Lt. Brent Smith of the Titus County (Texas) Sheriff's Office told reporters that there was no evidence of foul play.
In a 2002 piece for ESPN Magazine, Urlacher called his mother "my heart."
"My mother, Lavoyda, unexpectedly passed away Monday at her home in Texas," Urlacher said in a statement. "My first priority right now is to be with my family as we mourn her loss and make the arrangements to lay her to rest. This is a very difficult and emotional time for us and I sincerely ask that you respect our privacy. Thank you."
The Bears are obviously prepared to be understanding if Urlacher can't play, but they also know his value on the field. The team travels to New Orleans to play the Saints on Sunday.
"That's going to be tough for our football team [if Urlacher doesn't play Sunday]," Bears receiver Roy Williams told ESPN Chicago. "Whoever takes his spot [if necessary] will play well. My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family. He is the emotional leader of the football team, so we have his back."
Defensive end Israel Idonije(notes) agreed. "Our hearts are with him," Idonije said. "It's one of those times that you can't imagine, and 100 percent of our support is with him. At the end of the day, family and life comes first."
Bears quarterback Jay Cutler(notes) talked about what Urlacher meant to a team that is 21-13 with Urlacher in the lineup, and 7-8 without him since 2008. "You can't replace a guy like him," Cutler said. "He's the heart and soul of this team."

0 users disliked this comment just me 8 minutes ago Report Abuse So good to see that someone has the right heart condition to know that family first..It will be a wonderful fulfillment   when Revelation 21:3,4 comes to for fruition. Until then, keep mom in your heart and mind, and as already stated tears will turn to warm thoughts when you think back on the things mom did, and meant to you then and now!

Senator John Cornyn’s bill wants presidential secrets out! (Austin-American Stateman)
New troops for El Paso. (El Paso Times)
Next generation of Hunt oilmen sealing novel international deals. (Wall Street Journal)
Charlie Wilson’s War bonus edition:
The Chron thinks it’s a smart movie that falls short of greatness.
The Dallas Morning News likes it.

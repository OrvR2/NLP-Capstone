Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah sends private message to ObamaBy Laura RozenSenior Foreign Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Laura Rozen | The Envoy – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

National Security Advisor Tom Donilon met with Saudi King Abdullah in April. (Saudi Press …Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has sent a private message to President Obama, The Envoy has learned.
The message was delivered to the White House by the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Adel A. Al-Jubeir, who returned to Washington from a trip to the oil-rich kingdom last week, a former senior US official told The Envoy on condition of anonymity.
The exact subject of the correspondence remained opaque, but it was described as concerning a Saudi diplomatic initiative--possibly on Syria. The message was also described as substantive and "close-hold," meaning not  widely briefed beyond a small circle of senior officials.
The Saudi ambassador has since left Washington again, a second former senior US official who works on the region told The Envoy.
The White House declined to comment Tuesday.
The director of the Saudi embassy in Washington's information office, Nail al-Jubeir, the ambassador's brother, told the Envoy by email Tuesday that he had just returned from holiday and did not immediately have any information on such a message, but would look into it.
American-Saudi bilateral relations have been recovering from a period of tension. Riyadh has been upset by the Arab Spring uprisings, and was horrified by Obama's call last February for Washington's ally of three decades, Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, to step down from power.
King Abdullah declined to meet with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and later Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when they were traveling in the region last March.
Relations have seemed to improve, however, since that low point. The Saudi king granted an audience to Gates in April before the Pentagon chief's retirement. He also met with Obama's National Security Advisor Tom Donilon for over two hours in April.
In that meeting, Donilon delivered a personal letter from Obama to the Saudi monarch, the Washington Post's David Ignatius reported in April. "The  reassuring message ... was about 'the bond we have in a  relationship of 70 years that's rooted in shared strategic interest,'" Ignatius wrote, citing Donilon's description of Obama's message to the king.
A former American diplomat said that Obama has also asked for greater Saudi contributions to help fund the Palestinian Authority, whose declared plans to seek statehood recognition from the United Nations later this month have sparked threats to cut-off US assistance from some members of Congress.
The Saudi monarch "may have responded to Obama's request for money for the PA, and he will no doubt have strong views about what's happening in Syria," the former diplomat said, adding that it's not so unusual for the king to pass messages to Washington through Jubeir.
Washington Saudi analysts said the Saudi king trusts Amb. Jubeir, who he promoted to ambassador from   serving as the embassy's congressional liaison. King Abdullah prefers to conduct   personal diplomacy with the White House sending discreet communications through his hand-picked envoy, rather than  dealing  with US diplomats posted to Riyadh.
"Given that the king is not a phone person and is still stung by   Wikileaks, the shuttling is neither unusual nor surprising," one   Washington Middle East analyst commented.
(The king's alleged reservations about normal diplomatic channels may have turned out to be vindicated. A July 2008 US diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks in recent days   describes a medical evaluation of the Saudi monarch by a western   physician said to have read Abdullah's medical file. "It was  related  that King Abdullah is 92 years old  (born 1916), he remains a  heavy  smoker, regularly receives  hormone injections and 'uses Viagra   excessively,'" the cable, released by Wikileaks on September 1st, stated.)
Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns is scheduled to visit Saudi   Arabia in the next couple of weeks, an American official told The Envoy   Tuesday, on condition of anonymity because the trip has not yet been   announced.

The kings that live over there know what is in the best interest. Obama doesn't need to tell the king what he should and should not do near his borders, as he should be asking the king what to do. Now O thinks he is a king or something.

Progress?  record unemployment, tanked economy, record deficit spending, still in Afghanistan, still in Iran, GITMO still open, only 2,000 Chevy Volts sold, $800 billion spent and not a single job created, a social medicine program that is unconstitutional.  Hope and Change?  Hows that working so far?

I think President Obama rocks! He has done a great job even though he inherited an expensive and unpopular war not of his making and a totally destroyed US economy, by the way - also, not of his making. He is an idea person and will get us through the quagmires of these financially difficult times -of that I am sure. He is a true statesman - and very diplomatic and far thinking.  He is a true American statesman for ALL the people - not just the corporate mouthpieces as Bush and Reagan were. He is the best President we have had in a very long time and certainly the BEST one in a most difficult time. My extended family and I will ALL be voting for him in the next election. We are all white by the way and middle class wage earners, in several different states. We need to get off our national oil addiction as fast as we can - all go to electric or Hybrid cars! A huge national tax incentive will help with that!

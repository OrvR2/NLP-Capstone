Are Current Mortgage Rates Actually Low?By Richard Barrington | Forbes – Mon, Aug 8, 2011

This post provided by Money-Rates.com.
There can be a fair amount of hype associated with products like mortgages, so when you hear a phrase like "current mortgage rates are historically low," how seriously should you take it?
It turns out that there are at least three reasons you should take it  very seriously indeed. Current mortgage rates are historically low in  three distinct ways:
 1. Current mortgage rates are barely half of their historical average. Since  the early 1970s, 30-year mortgage rates have averaged 8.86 percent.  Current mortgage rates, at 4.50 percent for 30 years, are just over half  that average, and barely above the all-time low of 4.23 percent.

2. Current mortgage rates are low compared to inflation. Like  any interest rate, mortgage rates have to be considered in the context  of inflation. There are, after all, two components to an interest rate:  an inflation assumption, which is merely an attempt by the lender to get  the same purchasing power back when the loan is repaid, and a premium  over the inflation assumption, which is the real (i.e., after inflation)  profit the lender hopes to earn. Historically, that premium over  inflation has averaged 4.42 percent. Given the 3.6 percent inflation  rate over the past year, at 4.50 percent current mortgage rates  represent a premium over inflation of under 1 percent, or less than  one-fourth the historical average.
3. Current mortgage rates are even low relative to themselves. You  have a choice between a 30-year and a 15-year mortgage. As low as  current 30-year rates are, 15-year rates represent an even better  bargain. Since the early 1990s, 15-year mortgages have typically been  0.46 percent lower than 30-year mortgages. Now, they are 0.83 percent  lower. In no year has the discount for a 15-year mortgage exceeded an  average of 0.66 percent, so 15-year mortgages are in especially rare  territory right now.
If you are thinking of buying a house or refinancing a mortgage,  there are many factors to consider. One thing you can be sure of,  though, is that current mortgage rates really do offer an exceptional  opportunity.

Even though this article is one hour old, it's already out of date. It doesn't mention the US Downgrade - which will drive interest rates up in the near, middle, and long term. You can still get a good mortgage rate today... but only if you're in the final stages of purchasing and far along in the finance process. 

If you're not; you're out of luck.

They can drop to 1%. If you don't have the money to pay for it it is meaningless.

Intreat payments used to be simple intrest. A portion of intrest and a portion of principal paid each month. NOW the payments are all intrest in the beginning and No principal.
If you sell within the first 5-7 years you have paid off virtually no principal. Another banking trick they sucked us into. They all deserve what they are getting, Oh wait, we bailed them out. I guess we are getting what we deserve.

Sorry, but to use the interest rates of the 70's is like using the homers of the steroid era to compute averages. Never before in the history of long-term rates did we see what the 70's gave us.

The days of easy mortgages should be over.  It should be 20 percent down so the buyer truly has a vested interest in making the 15 to 30 years of mortgage payments.

Mortgage rates should be same as rate financial institutes pay on CD's, saving accounts. money market, etc. After all, they make billions with high credit card rates, over draft fees and other user fees.

Or they can just give you a mortgage for principal only, no interest or closing costs.

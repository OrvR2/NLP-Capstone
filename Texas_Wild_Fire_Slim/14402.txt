John Bauer

Posted by Charley Parker at 11:46 am 
 


While we’re still on our virtual visit to Sweden for yesterday’s post about Anders Zorn, we should stop by and say hi to John Bauer, a dramatically underappreciated fantasy artist.
Looking at Bauer’s wonderfully caricaturish trolls and gnomes, his glowing young princesses and his dark forests of ancient trees, their roots intertwined in Art Nouveau grace, it’s easy to jump to the conclusion that Bauer adopted many of the stylistic elements associated with the great illustrators that embody that approach, like Arthur Rackam, Kay Neilsen and Edmund Dulac. 
In fact, the influence  probably runs in the opposite direction, or at the very least in both directions. Bauer slightly predates Rackham, Neilsen and Dulac and, while he was undoubtedly influenced by them, his style and subject matter also likely informed much their work and, through them, influenced subsequent generations of fantasy artists.
Bauer himself was likely exposed to the work of Anders Zorn, who was popular in Sweden at the time, but was probably also influenced by Symbolist painters like Arnold Böcklin, visionaries like Gustav Moreau and William Blake and the stylized work of the Pre-Raphaelite and Art Nouveau artists, and perhaps the graceful illustration style of Walter Crane.
Bauer achieved prominence in Sweden with his illustrations for Bland Tomtar och Troll (Among Elves and Trolls), a yearly published book of fairy tales, and illustrated other books and periodicals. His wonderfully stylized drawing style, fascinating experiments with composition and his uncanny ability to make his fairy tale subjects simultaneously dark and elegantly charming have made him a favorite among those familiar with his work.
There is a John Bauer Museum site, which I think refers to a physical museum as well as the online one, but I’m unsure. 
It’s unfortunate that books of fairy tales for which he did his illustrations were not widely translated into English. Had they been, Bauer would be as familiar as Rackham. 


Site Quirks: The John Bauer Museum site is in Swedish and the English language flag is not linked. There is a gallery but I can't give you a direct link because the site is in frames (for no apparent reason). Go to the menu item for "John Bauer" and choose "Galleri". You may find it easier to browse the larger images on the Project Runeberg site, but both contain images of interest.

Anders Zorn

Posted by Charley Parker at 9:39 am 
 


As an art student, with an art student’s typical financial state, I used to haunt the used bookstores in and around Philadelphia, looking for those occasional gems of great art books that I could somehow afford. 
At one point, I came across a ragged copy of a small catalog of prints called Prints of Distinction, bearing the imprint of Charles Sessler, the Philadelphia rare book dealer. The book included graphic work by Rembrandt and Durer, and I could afford it because it was damaged, so it was a definite find. It was there that I was introduced to Whistler’s fantastic etchings, as well as the graphics of D.Y. Cameron, James McBey and Joseph Pennell, and the beautiful etchings of Anders Zorn.
Zorn was one of the greatest modern etchers, approaching even Whistler in his faculty for suggesting varying textures, lighting and atmosphere in etched line. (See my effusive post about Whistler’s Etchings.)
Anders Zorn is best known as a painter, however, and is often thought of as a “Swedish Impressionist”. He started his career as a sculptor, shifted to working in watercolor and gouache, and later moved to oil. He was renowned in his lifetime for his portraits, but is known today more for his beautiful, glowing and painterly nudes, and his impressionistic fascination with the reflective characteristics of water.
His subject matter can be divided into a few major categories, female nudes, water (often combined in images of women wading in shallow water at the edges of streams or lakes), genre pantings of farms and workers, and portraits. His portraits included sculptor Auguste Rodin, US President Grover Cleveland and his wife, and members of European society, as well as many portraits of himself, his wife, Emma, and other members of his family.
In his portraits in particular, I find it hard look at Zorn’s work without thinking of Sargent (which is a Good Thing). Like Sargent, Zorn exhibits a confident looseness and deceptively casual appearance to his handling of the paint that masks an exacting sense of composition and control of color.
I don’t know if they met or influenced one another, but I have to assume Zorn was aware of Sargent. Zorn traveled extensively in Europe and the US, working and learning, but always returned to his native Sweden, to the region of Dalarna and the town of Mora, where he was born.
The Zorn Collections are a group of four museums in Mora based on donations to the state of Sweeden by Zorn and his wife. The official site contains a bio and gallery that includes oils, watercolors, etchings and drawings, as well as information about the museums.
Unfortunately, I don’t know of any inexpensive books on Zorn that I can recommend. There is no Dover book of his etchings, (though there should be) and most of what’s in print is on the expensive side. 
The best I can suggest for those of you who are on an arts student’s budget is that you haunt the used bookstores, looking for those unexpected surprises.

The Comics Curmudgeon

Posted by Charley Parker at 12:20 pm 
 

Apartment 3-G, 3/22/06

OK. I know I’m dating myself by saying this, but I remember when newspaper comics used to actually be funny. 
No! Really! I’m serious!
It used to be that you could open the comics page of a major metropolitan newspaper like the The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Bulletin, or The Baltimore Sun and pretty reliably expect to laugh out loud several times in the course of reading the comics. 
Don’t look at me that way! It’s true! Go ask your Mom.
Of course, with very few exceptions, the current crop of bland, sanitized, tiny-paneled, poorly drawn and inexcusably unfunny comics are more likely to elicit bemusement, as in “Why is this page even here?”, and I won’t even go into the sorry state of newspaper adventure comics.
Enter The Comics Curmudgeon, a delightful blog by freelance writer Josh Fruhlinger that was originally called I Read The Comics So You Don’t Have To, in which he posts current comic strips and comments on them like… well, like the wonderful curmudgeon he is. 
Here’s a sample snippet of his take on the Apartment 3-G strip shown above from March 23:
“Holy crap but thatâ€™s a scary word balloon. It doesnâ€™t just have icicles; it has slime-dripping tentacles, like a floating jellyfish of scorn. Watch out, Eskimo-kissing couple in the background (or, alternately, waiter with poor sense of personal space and startled restaurant patron)! Margoâ€™s octopus of disdain has been unleashed, and thereâ€™s no stopping it!“
As he goes on, strip after strip, you not only realize how unfunny many of these strips are, but how truly and absolutely weird and bizarre the comics pages have become. His comments are often as funny as the newspaper comics “back when” used to be. 
The best way to read Josh’s posts is to click into the detail of a post so you can read his reader’s comments, many of which are almost as funny as Josh’s take, and then click through in the convenient “Next Post/Previous Post” links to other posts with comments.
Why aren’t these people writing comics?

The Tale of How

Posted by Charley Parker at 8:48 am 
 


Some drawings just look like they should be animated. I would love to see Van Gogh’s lively stipple dance across the screen, or Miro’s already living line actually grow and move like the organic thing it is. Fortunately some drawings that look like they should be animated actually reach that state.
When I first wrote about fascinating South African artist and illustrator Ree Treweek last month, and tried to describe her intricately detailed and wonderfully original drawings, I mentioned that she and her artist’s group (collectively known as “The Blackheart Gang”) were working on animating some of her drawings from a series called The Tale of How, which in turn is part of a larger scale project called The Household. (See my post about Ree Treweek from March 15, which includes links to more of her work.)
At the time there was a brief bit of teaser video of the animated work available on Brian Goodwin’s site, but The Blackheart Gang has recently posted a larger and longer clip, much to my delight. 
I was already impressed with the unique look of Treweek’s illustration, but combined with the interesting way the images have been isolated into parts and animated, with the addition of cgi and lots of imaginative thought, the resulting animation is something really original and wonderful. 
Treweek’s Blackheart Gang collaborators are Jannes Hendrikz (who sometimes collaborates on her illustrations), musician Marcus Wormstrom (still haven’t found the music video on which the group also worked together), and animators Justin Baker, Brian Goodwin and others (credits at the end of the clip). 
I initially encountered some problems with the downloaded movie file (see “Site Quirks”, below), but it works fine in a browser and if you have a broadband connection, it’s definitely worth viewing. When this is released it’s going to make a stir in the animation community.
In the meanwhile, we have a double treat. We get to enjoy Treweek’s wonderful drawings both as drawings and as part of The Blackheart Gang’s fantastic animated world. 


Site Quirks: The MPEG4 file is large (69mb) and requires the latest version of Quicktime. If you download the file and it has an ".mp4.mpg" extension on it, it will not play properly in Quicktime or VLC. Remove the ".mpg" part of the extension so it just reads: "TALE_OF_HOW.mp4" and it should play fine. Thanks to Dani Jones, (who is also a talented illustrator) for the fix!

The Morgan Library and Museum

Posted by Charley Parker at 10:30 am 
 


Finally! After 3 years of being off the map, one of the foremost collections and exhibition spaces for works on paper in the US is back.  The newly renamed Morgan Library and Museum (formerly The Pierpont Morgan Library) is set to reopen this Saturday, April 29, 2006.
I’ve been to number of exhibitions of master drawings at the Morgan over the years and they have all been memorable. The Library itself, developed from the private library of financier and all-around-rich-guy Pierpont Morgan, has a terrific collection of old master drawings, as well as historic manuscripts, books, bindings, music notation, Near Eastern scrolls, tablets and other art objects.
The museum, which is located on Madison Ave. at 36th Street in New York (entrance on 36th),  has undergone its most extensive renovation ever with new gallery space, four story court, cafe and auditorium, as well as an unfortunately inappropriate new Bauhausian entrance structure, but that’s a minor quibble.
The Library and Museum will debut its dramatically expanded exhibition space with a show of treasures from its own holdings: Masterworks from the Morgan, which runs from April 29 to July 2, 2006. And treasures they are. Old Pierpont had pretty good taste in master drawings (image above, clockwise from top-left: Rembrandt, Delacroix, Watteau, Goya, Rubens).
The Morgan also has a renovated web site which allows you to look through some of the drawings and other artifacts and, like the same feature on the Met’s site, zoom way in on them.

Panos Fake Roadsigns

Posted by Charley Parker at 9:09 am 
 

Art is usually a bit isolated. Paintings and sculpture sit quietly in museum halls, hang in place on gallery walls or in collectors’ homes. A certain amount of sculpture punctuates city streets and parks, but for the most part we don’t encounter that many art objects unintentionally.
Panos Fake Roadsigns is a collaborative project that takes the work of 47 artists from around the world, in the form of 105 fake road signs, and turns the streets of Lyon, France into an enormous gallery without walls. 
The round red and white signs look enough like real European traffic signs that you might take them for granted, but weird enough if you notice them to make you stop and think; which is likely what people will do with signs that seem to indicate “octopus ahead”, “bubble blowing not permitted”, “feces area” or “fallopian tube zone”. 
I’m not always fond of “installation” art that takes itself too seriously, but this project has a delightful sense of humor, lots playful absurdity and a wonderful scale. The accompanying web site gives a little (very little) background on the project, but the interesting thing, of course, is the signs themselves.
Unfortunately the site is hampered by a rather cramped Flash interface. Go to the “Artists” tab and click through them to see the signs both in situ and close up. Under the sign design you will find links to all of that artist’s designs as well as a link to that artist or studio’s site. Each artist or studio contributed one to three designs. 
The exhibition is produced by Unchi Leisure Center and curated by Kanardo. Contributors include tokyoplastic, who I recently profiled, and from whose Press section I learned about the exhibit.
Keep your eyes open when you’re walking around, you never know when you may be walking through a gallery.

Flight 3 preview

Posted by Charley Parker at 9:09 am 
 

I have a rant and then a rave. First, let me go on record as saying that I like superhero comics. I really do. I’ve been reading them for years and I’ll continue to read them. There is some great stuff being done in the genre. It’s just that there are… so many of them. 
They crowd the shelves of the comic book specialty shops, shelf after shelf, row after row, title after title; an endless procession of teeth-gritting, brow-furrowing, muscle-popping, ridiculously costumed and stupidly named second and third string characters smashing and bashing their way through mind-numbingly repetitive stories month after month… AAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!
It’s not that that’s bad in itself. I’m an enthusiastic supporter of comics in any form, so you would think my attitude would be “the more the merrier”, but this overwhelming dominance of superhero comics is not a good thing. What essentially should be a niche genre (and is, in other countries where comics are popular, like France, Italy and Japan) has been the essence and substance of the American comic book mainstream for 50 years. It’s one of the main reasons comics are disrespected as a valid art form in the US; it has stifled the growth of the medium; and worst of all, kept some of the most creative and talented voices out there from being heard by anything but a tiny audience. Yes, occasionally exceptions, like Jeff Smith’s Bone, will actually break out and reach a wider audience, but these are rare.
The problem with the dominance of the mainstream superhero comic “products” (and that’s what they are to the people who own these companies, make no mistake) is that they crowd everything else off the shelves. In a field that relies on small, usually independent, comic book specialty shops for most of its distribution network, it doesn’t take much to fill up the shelves, and the shop owners’ purchasing budget, with the reams of poor quality second string superhero titles the big companies keep pumping out; which, of course, is exactly what they’re for. This is a deliberate and calculated policy on the part of the large comic book companies to stifle competition (the latest insane expression of which is the attempt by Marvel and DC to jointly trademark the generic term “superhero” so smaller companies can’t use it). 
So the wonderfully varied and imaginative work of hundreds of talented independent comics creators, work that has a real potential to change public perception of the medium and dramatically expand the audience and market for comics in general, is suppressed by the mainstream companies while they fight over shelf space in their tiny superhero market ghetto. Brilliant.
Meanwhile, out in the creative hinterlands, where the aforementioned independent comics creators toil in obscurity, wonderful things are happening. Independently created webcomics, unrestrained by the narrow minded mainstream comics distribution system, are growing like crazy, creators are being noticed and voices are being heard. Delightfully, some of this creative explosion is making its way into print and actually showing up on the comic book shelves next to the latest issue of The Ultimate, Amazing, Spectacular Spider-clone. 
Another exceptional breakout is trying to happen, this time with multiple creators in an anthology book, a comics format that has a notoriously poor track record but is somehow working this time. Kazu Kibuishi, one of those wonderful independent comic creators I keep telling you about, has been quietly starting a revolution with an experiment that has grown into a series of terrific anthology books that do exactly what needs to be done; using the very variety and quality of these independent creator’s voices to support one another. Each of the previous editions of Flight, Flight 1 and Flight 2, have showcased a number of wonderfully talented comics creators with unique voices, styles and things to say. By putting them together, the Flight anthologies have made a proverbial whole greater than the sum if its parts that demonstrates some of the potential out there.
The latest volume, Flight 3, is due in June. If you shop at a comics specialty store, you can go there now and pre-order it. You can also order it from your local independent bookshop (if you’re lucky enough to still have one), chain bookstore, or Amazon.
Flight 3 promises to be the best, most varied and most enjoyable volume yet and you can get a nice taste of it in advance courtesy of the Comic Book Resources site, which has put up a multi page preview of dozens of beautiful pages that you can view online. The preview is in two parts, part 1 here, and part 2 here. (Images above, from top: Johane Matte, Rodolphe Guenoden, Paul Harmon.)
You can also visit the Flight Blog, and Kibuishi’s Bolt City, for news about the upcoming release. There are also previews for Flight 1 here, and Flight 2 here.
If you thought comics are not for you because you’re just not into the whole teeth-gritting, knuckle bashing, spandex tights superhero thing; or even if you already enjoy superhero comics (as I do, remember), but are just curious about what else is out there in the way of new, different and creative comics, here’s a great place to start.

Hans Holbein The Younger

Posted by Charley Parker at 8:18 am 
 


Some artists can be an integral part of, and simultaneously transcend, their times. Hans Holbein The Younger, a Bavarian artist who made his career as a court painter for Henry VIII of England, was one of the foremost portrait painters of the Northern Renaissance and was very much a part of, and in some ways beyond, his times.
I first encountered Holbein through reproductions of his wonderful portrait drawings in an inexpensive Dover book. I was struck by how immediate and precise they seemed, with just exactly the lines necessary, in precisely the position and proportion needed, to absolutely nail the likeness. Bam! No question in your mind that this is what this person looked like. Even though his drawings feel a little formal, they seem remarkably modern in some ways.
Not long after discovering his drawings, I found that his paintings were no less impressive, painted with a precision and technical mastery that also seems suprisingly modern, and can still wow you even after being exposed to centuries of subsequent painters. 
Holbein’s remarkable portrait of Sir Thomas More (above), Henry VIII’s diplomatic envoy and Privy Councillor and later Lord Chancellor of England, had impressed me in reproductions for years before I had the opportunity to see it in person at the Frick Collection in New York. I was still stunned by it. 
The painting is large, 29 x 24″ (75 x 60 cm), and the life-size visage of the subject is imposing, with an almost physical presence. Closer examination of the painting just adds to the impressiveness of Holbein’s mastery. The velvet sleeves look as though they must be actual velvet that you could reach out and touch, and the texture of the other cloth is remarkable as well. The face and hands are rendered with a confident virtuosity that is just astonishing.
The Frick’s online collection provides a larger image here, and a nicely done zoomable image here.
Holbein has many other notable paintings and one stands out in particular. The Ambassadors is remarkable for a number of reasons. Enough so, in fact, that I think I’ll make it the topic of a separate post.
Holbein, conveniently enough, apprenticed to his father, Hans Holbein the Elder, who was also a painter of note, straddling the transition from Gothic to Renaissance styles. Holbein the Younger was firmly in the Northern Renaissance and clearly influenced by the masters of the Italian Renaissance. There is some debate as to whether he actually traveled to Italy to acquire that influence first hand, but his mastery seems to suggest more than a second hand exposure.
You can still buy the very inexpensive Dover book that got me going on Holbein: Holbein Portrait Drawings, as well as more expensive volumes on his paintings, like Hans Holbein the Younger: Painter at the Court of Henry VIII by Stephanie Buck, Jochen Sander, Thames, Hudson.
If you’re tempted to think of Holbein’s painting of Moore as looking “photographic”, keep in mind that it predates Niépce and Daguerre’s first attempts to capture a photographic image with silver iodide by more than 300 years.

Gamma Ray Studios

Posted by Charley Parker at 2:24 pm 
 


One of the fascinating things about concept art is the tension between restraint and imagination. On one hand, concept art is restrained by the set demands of the project, usually a movie or high end game for which specific scenes, settings, costumes, props and other elements must be designed. Within those restrictions, however, the goal is to be as imaginative as possible, all in search of the dazzling images and settings in the finished product that will help bring jaded audiences into the the theaters or game stores in search of a new visual high.
The best concept artists manage to be very imaginative in spite of the “creativity on demand” nature of their field, and occasionally step outside the restrictions to do personal work, like the pieces above from veteran concept artists James Clyne (left) and Feng Zhu (right). 
I profiled James Clyne last September, and Feng Zhu in October.  Both are in the top echelon of movie and gaming concept art and art direction. I just recently learned that they partnered last fall to form a conceptual design studio called Gamma Ray Studios. 
Their combined histories have left them with an impressive client list, and a wonderfully imaginative body of work, some of which can be seen in the Gamma Ray Studios Gallery [Note: not anymore, see update below]. The amount of images there is limited, but both artists still maintain their individual portfolio sites, with more extensive galleries, information and tutorials. In addition, Feng Zhu has a new venture and website called SketchGirls.
In both cases, a walk through their galleries will show you something about high end concept art. The “restraint” aspect of the project requirements won’t be visible, but the “imagination” aspect certainly will.
Update: Gamma Ray Studios is no more, and the domain has been grabbed up by spammers. I’ve left the article in place but removed links to the domain. See the individual sites of James Clyne and Feng Zhu, below. – Charley 5/31/09

Campaigntoons

Posted by Charley Parker at 11:56 am 
 

By now we’re all acculturated to being sold things by way of animated cartoons. 
They start us early, dazzling our just-out-of-babyhood eyes with bouncing, sparkling bowls of chocolate-frosted, sugar-coated imitation food-like substances that are “part of this nutritious breakfast”, and move on to toys and games and even later to cars, insurance and everything else. 
With their bright colors, simplified forms and magical moving drawings, animated cartoons are just so gosh darned appealing. 
Get ready for a new wave of being sold by way of cartoon animation, this time being sold a political choice. 
Most of you are probably familiar with the Jib-Jab cartoons, a series of modestly amusing and not particularly well done animated web cartoons that lampooned political figures. The key thing about them is that they became amazingly popular across the web by word of mouth (or, more accurately, word of email), a phenomenon that has become marked by a buzzword dear to the hearts of marketers, “viral marketing”. 
The idea behind viral marketing is that, instead of spending millions to buy a few seconds of air time to try to shove your message down the throats of a resistant and TiVo-armed populace, you spend much less on an advertising vehicle that is clever and appealing enough for people to willingly spread across the internet themselves, via email, blogs, web site links, etc. 
You and I are both participating in this process at the moment. 
I’m telling you about, and providing a link to, an animated cartoon that is intentional viral marketing for a political campaign. 
I find it interesting enough to pass along, partly because it’s well-done and partly because it represents the tip of a trend that will grow to be overwhelmingly obvious in coming months and years.
The ad is part of the govenor’s race in Nevada, where candidate Jim Gibson is using the cartoon to accuse his opponent Dina Titus of taking money from Enron without acknowledging its disposition. To do this he enlisted the services of the web animation studio Slamtoons, which has changed its name to Campaigntoons, to create an animated viral marketing ad that portrays Titus as a Jedi being corrupted by the dark side of the force, in the form a $2000 contribution from The Emperor (who one assumes is Kenneth lay in a hooded cloak). 
The cartoon is actually nicely done, with nicely stylized characters, good backgrounds and good use of simple color and shading. The animation is minimal, of course, as in almost all web cartoons, but it’s effectively used. 
I think we’ll see a lot more from this group (the cartoon also acts as viral marketing for them), and from many other web-based animators of varying degrees of ability, as the election approaches and the campaign funds start to flow. So pull up a bowl of chocolate-frosted, sugar-coated imitation food-like substance and enjoy the show.

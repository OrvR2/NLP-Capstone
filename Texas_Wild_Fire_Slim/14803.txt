FIRST PERSON | AUSTIN, Texas -- Black smoke fills the sky around our neighborhood but for now, we are safe. In an instant, that could all change. One shift in the winds could send raging uncontained wildfires in our direction. One cigarette tossed out a window would spark another blaze that could burst out of control and take out entire cities.


  In the last 48 hours, 852 homes have burned in the Texas wildfires. Officials report that more than 1,000 homes were destroyed and over 115,000 acres have burned in the past week alone.


  Small fires are popping up in neighborhoods all over Central Texas. These are usually easily and quickly contained and you may not hear about them on the news, especially national news, which is focused on the larger fires that have burned 100 or more acres. Many are started by cigarettes tossed carelessly. Some are caused by outdoor barbecues and others are caused by the seemingly insignificant things such as parking a car with a hot engine on dry grass or a small animal being electrocuted by power lines and falling on dry leaves.


  In an area suffering from the most extreme drought in decades, that's all it takes to spark a fire. And once it begins, it's very hard to stop it. We did not grill out for Labor Day. We have not grilled in weeks but when we do, it's with the fire hose nearby and with the grill sitting on a hard, cement surface. We never leave it unattended for even a minute. When situations become this dire, even your daily habits change in consideration of the potential dangers that can come from a moment of carelessness.


  The forecast still calls for 0 percent chance of rain but winds have slowed to about 8 mph, some relief from Monday's gusts as high as 40 mph and air pollution is at a watch level of Orange, meaning people with respiratory illness like myself and my children should remain indoors. While the temperatures have cooled enough to enjoy some time outdoors, the fires have forced those of us still in safe locations indoors, waiting to see if the flames will reach us, too.

EFFECTIVENESS MONITORING









[ Print | 

 ]



Forestry Best Management Practices (BMPs) have been developed and implemented for over 20 years in Texas to reduce the water quality impacts of silvicultural activities.  The Texas Forest Service promotes the use of these practices and routinely monitors BMP implementation.  Published reports have shown that the forestry community has adopted these guidelines, noting high BMP implementation ratings.  However, this approach only addresses the presence and functionality of BMPs, not their actual effectiveness in protecting water quality.A BMP effectiveness project has been conducted to evaluate Texas’ BMPs for protecting water quality during intensive, operational forestry activities. This project followed the BACI study design (before – after / control – impact) and focused on monitoring biological communities (benthic macroinvertebrates and fish) found in East Texas streams.  Physiochemical monitoring was conducted to calculate sediment and nutrient loading occurring from these operations.  This monitoring was conducted at points along the stream, above and below the treatment area, to establish reference and test conditions.  Baseline data, collected one year before the treatment, was compared to data collected for three years after the treatment.  Preliminary results from this project support that BMPs, when applied properly, are effective in protecting water quality. Location of Monitoring Sites Typical Layout of Project SiteSampling Parameters

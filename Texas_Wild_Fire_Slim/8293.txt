Minister: Uruguay should apologize to HaitiAP – Wed, Sep 7, 2011





MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) — Uruguay's defense minister said Tuesday that his country should apologize to Haiti and give reparations to an 18-year-old man allegedly sexually assaulted by Uruguayan U.N. peacekeepers in the Caribbean country.The alleged attack, which occurred on a U.N. base in the southern city of Port-Salut, has sparked protests in Haiti as well as investigations by the United Nations, Uruguay and Haiti.Defense Minister Eleuterio Fernandez Huidobro said the Uruguayan investigation will "go to the bone."Uruguay "should apologize as urgently as possible to the people and government of Haiti, give reparations to the victim of these abhorrent acts, be exhaustive in its investigation and apply the maximum imaginable sanction against those responsible," Fernandez Huidobro told reporters in comments on the ministry's website.The encounter took place on July 20 but only became public last week when a video taken by cell phone was circulated. The Uruguayan military initially called the incident a prank that got out of hand.But Fernandez Huidobro said members of the armed forces are prohibited from "referring to this episode as a joke, since the use of that word is shameful for any armed forces' official because here there was no joke, but a serious aggression against a person."In the video, several Uruguayan troops are seen pinning the young man face down on a mattress, laughing and pulling his pants down. They shout "What's the problem here?" as the man repeatedly responds "No problem."Then, the Uruguayans laugh as a peacekeeper stands in between the man's legs and seems to simulate a sex act until others shout "stop, Crazy." The peacekeeper then slaps the man's naked rear end several times and steps away.In Haiti, the half brother of the alleged victim, Dony Clivens, said by telephone that even if the family accepted money offered, U.N. troops wouldn't change the way they treat Haitians."The money isn't the only thing," he said. "Our integrity is more important than money."

Why should anybody or anything ever apologize to Haiti. They are the biggest leeches on the plante. They should all be neutered.

to all that has posted a negative comment...what has Haiti or haitian people have done to you, read our history and you will see why we are suffering today, and why as a nation we are strong....Learn to respect haitians, at our peak we've helped many other countries become what they are today...how do you feel about yourselves making fun or putting shame on a victim or another country...yall make me sick!!!!

that's why other countries should just stay out of other countries affairs. The country which is being helped eventually feels harassed and then hates the people of the country helping them. and that's why 9/11 happened

haiti should say they are sorry for all the money wasted on kickbacks,croupt gov. officials who take money off of people trying to help

I am certain that Uruguay's Defense Minster was not aware that Barrack "epic failure" Obama has already apologized to the individual, paid him several million dollars in reparations, and blamed George W. Bush not only for the earthquake, but also for the incident itself.

Aren't Haitians the ones that gang rape 7 year old girls? These poor soldiers from Uruguay are probably sick and tired of seeing what animals live in Haiti. No blacks in their country so this is a real learning experience for them.

well Haitians can expect no more from white people......their ultimate aim is to sodomize everyone and everything.....i can bet these sick scumbags completely ignored women in nearby rooms...NYC loves this kind of nasty stuff...heard what they just legalized?

S Lanka troops 'abused Haitians'  

Sri Lankan authorities were involved in the investigation 
The UN is sending home more than 100 of the 950 Sri Lankan peacekeepers in Haiti, accusing them of sexual abuse, including with underage girls

why the fock are there UN peace keepers in Haiti?
Nations should really butt out of other nations' business.




 






tortuga

if it happen . this is a criminal act... un solders are there to act to strict guidelines....no excuse and they should be held accountable... it is not how everyone feels about haiti it is about how solders acted in a criminal fashion on a mission to protect and preserve a society on trying to recover from a catastrophe....not to take advantage of and humiliate a person they are sworn to protect...

what is this? Haiti is a playing ground,for UN peace force!!!!! couple of years ago sri lankan army was send back because of these kind of bahavior but UN or sri lankan government didn'y take any action

As an ex commando for the U.S forces, I'm totally opposed to what happen there. Where's the honor in hitting, kicking or sodomizing a poor human bein that way?.
If UN peace keepers were sent there, we expect them to do their jobs professionally and with courtesy & dignity.

"An eye for eye leaves a whole world blind".

No one deserves that kind of treatment, no one!
If we're there is to HELP and not to cause more problems as there is.
Those soldiers deserve to be investigated it and then punished for what they did.
I totally agree with the Defense Minister.
PS: before you attack me with your vicious insults and arrogant words...just think if that was your people?

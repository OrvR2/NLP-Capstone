Rare! Jeff Francoeur gets A’s rookie with the ol’ 9-3 putout By      'Duk


Consider it a lesson learned: If Michael Taylor(notes) wants to record more hits when Jeff Francoeur's(notes) rocket arm is playing right field, he's going to have to pick up the pace on his way to first.
The Oakland Athletics rookie became only the fifth American League player since 1974 to fall victim to a 9-3 putout when a throw from Kansas City's right field arrived at first base before he did.
It was a slightly embarrassing moment for the young September call-up, who recorded his first major league hit on Tuesday night and thought he had his second before Frenchy nailed him for the third out of Wednesday's second inning.
Even the broadcaster announcing the play chalked Taylor's swing as a hit until Francoeur quickly gathered the hop and fired the ball back to an alert Eric Hosmer(notes).
From MLB.com:
"I knew it was going to be a close play," Taylor said. "I hit it and knew I hit it right at him. I took off and it hopped right to him, and he made a strong throw. It was a great play. He did everything he was supposed to do, and I did what I was supposed to do, and he came out on top."
As Brian Wilson(notes) used to say in the Giants' happier days, "Got heeem!"
Check out the unusual play here: 

Though this was only the fifth such putout in AL history since 1974 — the furthest these types of records go back — it's a little more common in the National League, where plodding pitchers often dawdle on their way to first base. There have been 31 9-3 putouts in the NL since '74.  Perhaps the most famous one came way before that: All the way back in 1880, when a 9-3 putout saved the first perfect game in pro baseball history for Worcester's Lee Richmond.
Several media outlets quoted Francoeur saying this was the second 9-3 putout of his career, but his memory of that play is a little bit fuzzy. He says he got Mat Latos(notes) at first when he played for the Mets, but as this video shows, Francoeur's attempt sailed over the first baseman's head and Latos reached safely.
Taylor wasn't so lucky with this one. Watching Francoeur (and Hosmer) pull off the feat was pretty entertaining, especially since Taylor wasn't exactly jogging on his way to first.
"The ball was just laced at me with the perfect hop," Francoeur said. "You've got to give Hoz a lot of credit, too, because he saw how hard I was charging and he just ran right to the bag and I just let it go. You kind of feel bad because you do it to a guy in his fourth game in the big leagues, but hey, that was really, really fun."
Agreed and maybe even Taylor can eventually look back on this one and laugh. After all, the A's won 7-0 and Taylor did get that second hit of his career later in the game.

0 users disliked this comment OMG_OMG Sat Sep 10, 2011 06:33 pm PDT Report Abuse Chris,Claudia,Katelyn , you are 100% correct, Larry walker did it in Montreal, he actually did it twice year in 1992, but the 1st base ump blew the call the second time because the replay showed he wasn't even paying attention as he was not expecting the throw , quite pathetic. He was rumored to havee doe it 5 times in the minors.

 He has a rifle for an arm and he tried it quite often. No jogging to 1st base for anyone on the other team...

The ball shot from the plate very fast, so the right   fielder had just enough time to make the great play, and the first baseman kept his foot on the bag, too.

10 users disliked this comment Daniel Fri Sep 09, 2011 04:40 am PDT Report Abuse Hate to brag, but my 13 year old son made the same play from left field in this years triple crown turney. But his throw was all the way to home as their 3rd base coach sent his runner. Even their parents were amazed at my sons arm and we had a great and alert catcher who got the tag 2 feet from the plate. I think we are hopefully looking at a free ride to college.
 Although their head coach and the poor kids father get so angry and foul they got ejected. I would never let my son play for a coach like that.Comment hidden due to low rating.  Show Comment

He should be benched for the rest of the season.   2 times at a Mud Hens game a few weeks ago I was going crazy as they jogged to second for double and stood there.   the oudfeilder had not even picked up the ball yet.   TRIPLE if you are running.

Watch the video, and then comment; instead of commenting on what you think the video might show.

Taylor was running....   a great fielder with a great arm was positioned perfectly, alert, and made a great play.

You should always bust @$$ down the base path on a clean single in case Franceour doesn't come up with the ball cleanly.   That way, you might stretch it into two.

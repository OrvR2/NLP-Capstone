WASHINGTON -- Three individuals were arrested and charged with trespassing on Tuesday for protesting a speech by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Video footage taken by an attendee at the event shows that one of them, Tom Nielsen, received particularly harsh treatment -- he was pushed to the ground and handcuffed. Nielsen received an additional charge of resisting arrest.
Ryan was speaking Tuesday afternoon at the Whitnall Park Rotary Club. Protesters gathered both outside his event and inside, standing up and disrupting the congressman's remarks.
According to Oak Creek Patch, as many as a dozen protesters were escorted out of the event. Another dozen or so left willingly. 
Nielsen is a 71-year-old retired plumber from Kenosha, which falls within Ryan's district. He had never been able to attend a Ryan town hall event in the past -- partly, he explained, because he rarely knew when they were scheduled for in advance -- and was excited to get to Tuesday's to make his views heard.
In video posted by Wisconsin Jobs Now, Nielsen shouts that he disagrees with Ryan on entitlement programs during the congressman's speech. Two uniformed police officers and another man in a suit then escort Nielsen out. In the hall, Nielsen can be heard shouting. He was eventually pushed to the ground and handcuffed by police officers. 
"Three people got me and hauled me backwards out the side door and into a little room. ... They pushed me the floor and twisted my arms back and handcuffed me. They said I was resisting arrest," recounted Nielsen in an interview with The Huffington Post.
"I have a broken clavicle from a car accident I had about four weeks ago, and it's in the process of healing, but it's not done yet. So I was protecting that. I said, 'Don't hurt me! I have a broken shoulder here and collarbone.' They didn't pay attention to that. They put the cuffs on really, really tightly."
Nielsen and the two other individuals who were arrested had to sit in a "paddy wagon" for an hour or two before being taken to the police station, he said.
Nielsen said he is still a bit sore from Tuesday's scuffle. He faces fines amounting to approximately $1,000 for trespassing and resisting arrest, which he plans to challenge in court.
Ryan took heat during the August recess for refusing to hold any open, public, free town hall events. Instead, he has chosen to speak at events -- such as the one at the Rotary Club -- hosted by outside groups that often require admission fees to attend. 
Nielsen received his ticket to the event from Wisconsin Jobs Now. The group purchased extra tickets to the event and handed them out to protesters who wanted to attend.
After Nielsen was removed from the event, Ryan tried to make light of the situation, saying, "I hope he's taking his blood pressure medication."
Ryan's office did not return a request for comment.

				Sad...Frig­htening...­words come to mind like "Black Shirts", 'Gestapo', 'Storm Troopers'.­..what has become of our free country whre freedom of speech was valued?  Pull a gun or knife? Yes, get wrestled to the ground and hauled away in cuffs. Hurl an object and yes, get arrested. But interupt a speaker and hurl honest questions about one's Social Security? THAT folks, is NOT cause for elderly people to be forced to the ground, cuffed, arrested and led away!!!! THAT is what they did in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy and Soviet Russia...a­nd now in America!

				The double standard is amazing. With the summer of tea party rage they yelled and got right up in the face of Dems and acted violent and carried guns and I never saw one arrest or person stopped or restrained­. If your a progressiv­e and you taunt you get arrested like some kind of enemy combatant? Hasn't anyone noticed this? Imagine if people went to Bush speeches with assault rifles and hand guns. They did with Obama. With Bush they would have been sent to Gitmo.

				Well Ryan just lost any chance of a vote from me for anything except a honypot cleaner or metermaid, although I don't think they want him in their ranks. I cannot believe that a constituen­t of his who had a right to be upset with Ryans proposals says to his cronyism crowd who giggle at his suggestion that he hopes the man was taking his blood pressure medication­. It shows the callous, greedy, Uncompassi­onate  attitude of the current republican party. Yes it is the party of the rich and we all know they part with their morals long before their money. Unles it is to get someone elected who promises them "No More Taxes" kind of a reverse Robin Hood you know, Steal from the poor and give it to the rich. So to Mr Ryan I say, "Hi Ho Silver and away from Mr. Un-Robhood­" as we continue to look for the real canidate.

				Modern republican­s are like the pukey weakling in school who instigated trouble, then ran behind the teacher or his mom when about to get his comeuppanc­e.  Like that kid in school,who eventually got pounded to a pulp for his behavior, there will be a time when the protection that republican­s rely on to get their way will be gone, exposing them to the suppressed ire of the public.

Unlimited rights for business corporatio­ns to be free of any government involvemen­t.

When the government is reduced "to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub," as Grover Norquist said, there will be no one to uphold our laws or our Constituti­on.

				Free speech my left hind leg. Listen, essentiall­y, what Ryan controls is free speech. Those who choose to pay, will remain 'silent' or raise their hand accordingl­y. That elderly gentleman received a ticket from the Wisconson Jobs Now group. He spoke out, passionate­ly on having paid into a system and resents Ryan's agenda...a­nd rightfully so. 

Do you think Ryan would have addressed him anyother way? By email, personal letter? No, because the elderly, to the Republican­s...are disposable­.

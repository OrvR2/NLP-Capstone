250.11 Fire Victim Benefit Concert at Threadgill’s
Live Music, Things To Do In Austin | 9 Sep 2011

While the fires have been so devastating and had such an impact on Central Texas, it’s nice to see how the city has responded and banded together to help our neighbors and friends.

Carter Beckworth turned his show tonight into a benefit. Any donation of money or supplies (cases of water, energy bars, energy drinks) gets you free entry to the show and an autographed copy of his new self-titled solo record.
They are also working to collect autographed items from other local Austin bands to auction off, and of course, all proceeds will benefit the relief effort.
Tomorrow there will be a benefit concert out at Nutty Brown Café. For more information on that concert visit: http://www.stringsattached.org/shows.php?showType=strings&showId=2327&date=2011-09-06.
Admission: $10
Time: Opening Act: 9 p.m. Casey Beckworth 11 p.m.
Location:
301 West Riverside Drive
Austin, Texas 78704

Do you know of any fundraisers/benefit concerts that are during the day? I would love to take my kids so that they can participate as well.

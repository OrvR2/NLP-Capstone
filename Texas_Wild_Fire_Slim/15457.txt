Perry’s surprising power forces Romney to adjust

Washington — 
Rick Perry entered the Republican presidential race like a jackrabbit bounding out of the West Texas prairie. He quickly hopped past longtime leader Mitt Romney, who was deliberately, step by step, inching his way toward the nomination he felt was his to win.
Now, Romney’s strategists are hoping that the former Massachusetts governor plays the tortoise to Rick Perry’s hare, slowly and steadily working to win the long race, and that Perry fades in the stretch.
But presidential contests are not fables, and it’ll take a lot more than hope to make Romney finish first. That’s why the former Winter Olympics CEO and Bain Capital executive has adjusted his campaign’s business plan to take into account the unexpectedly strong challenge from a candidate they had not expected to enter the race.
With Perry leading Romney in the last nine national polls by margins ranging from six percentage points to 19, the former front-runner has overhauled his above-the-fray campaign persona. Over the past week, and during Perry’s first GOP presidential debate on Wednesday, Romney has begun to engage with his most serious challenger.
Some of the contrasts are direct – Romney has chosen to make the future of Social Security a key issue in the primary by declaring his strong support for the retirement program while Perry calls it a “monstrous lie” and a “Ponzi scheme.”
Some are indirect – Romney says the nation needs a hard-headed businessman (him) rather than a career politician (Perry) to guide it through economic hard times.
Some are tactical – Romney has intensified his efforts to court Tea Party Republicans in an attempt to compensate for Perry’s early successes among establishment conservatives.
Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the liberal Brookings Institution, said Romney needs to “show some life and fight” when challenging Perry.
“The whole point is to try to show himself as an adult at a very serious time,” Mann said. “And with Perry being more reckless, being a cowboy, Romney’s going to convey these times are too perilous to take a chance with that.”
For Romney to regain the lead, political analysts say, he needs to convince Republican primary voters who desperately want to defeat Barack Obama that he, not Perry, offers the Grand Old Party its best chance to reclaim the White House.
“What Romney has to do to beat back Perry is argue that Perry can’t be elected in the general election,” said Drake University political scientist Dennis Goldford.

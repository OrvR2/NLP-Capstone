You "Inside Job" fanatics have to get a life...geeeez....the government doesn't owe you a living..it's up to you to make a life for yourself and be happy...I know this may sound a bit smarmy but, it's pretty simple.

I'm going to eat a 9/11 breakfast on 9/11.  It will be two tall stacks of burnt pancakes smothered in ketchup with flattened sausage patties to represent all of the cops that died in that horrible, horrible tragedy.

Yesterday

I also credit the Big Guy upstairs for saving my life- how else can I explain what happened to me that fateful day of 9/11. I was working as a copywriter for a NY firm in the one of the Towers that day, somewhere in the middle of the Tower but closer to the top, when I was saved by my upset stomach. Let me explain: I was running late that day to the office and I grabbed something to eat from one of those street food vendors to hold me until lunch time and once I got to my office I felt ill and started getting stomach cramps. Whatever I ate did not sit well in my stomach. I remember this rancid yellowish substance of syruppy shit revuleting out of my orifice down my pant leg to the back of my loafers. I remember running out of the office and rushing to the elevator that took me down to the first floor and to a bathroom that would give me more privacy and no one would know where that smell left in my office upstairs came from- thank God. Any who I was so lucky because as soon as I took care of business in the bathroom downstairs, I was about to go back up when I heard this boom and could see debris coming down on the sidewalk and street just outside the front door of the Twin Tower No. 1 building. If it wasn't for my weak stomach I probably wouldn't be here to tell my story. Needless to say I ran out of the first floor and ran as far as I could before the Tower collapsed. I just hope no one discovered my underwear in the debris since it had my name embroidered on them.

Yesterday

I remember 2 building getting knocked over.  Then I remember 11 years of war, invading other countries, killing innocent women and children, hearing lies on the news every single day. CIA cover military coups de tats, economy failing, extended devotion to Israel, and Haliburton being awarded sweet government contracts.  I remember and that is what I witnessed.  The media can tell it anyway they like, but that is what happened.

Yesterday

I was at Tower One on the Friday before.  There was never a time I went there and was not held in awe of those buildings.  After watching last night the memorial footprints, now a water fall, I was able to see the spot I last stood there on that Friday in September.  It was now the close of one chapter and for a new one to begin.  

I can't wait to go back and stand in that spot and say a prayer for all of those who perished.  I will also pray for those who died working at the sight following September 11.  I will pray for those family members who still live with pain of their lost loved ones.   Yes, I watched like everyone else that terrible day and when the towers went down, my life was changed forever.  

This is a time to reflect and remember and NOT condone those who made decisions that day.  History is still to be written on what was done right and maybe wrong at the time.  Instead of complaining about some ones' actions, think about your own.  What have YOU done to help since the towers came down?

Yesterday

I wasn't living in New York on 9/11, however it changed my life forever. The Bush Administration mishandled  9/11.They invaded the wrong Country, and killed about 250,000  innocent people. This is the primary reason for our poor economy. The cost of the wars, and the tax-cuts to millionaires/billionaires.

I live in Connecticut and I will never forget being on the highway and seeing the signs saying "All Bridges to NYC Closed."  I had never seen that before and I hope I never see it again.  I will NEVER forget that day.  God Bless all the people who perished that day as well as all the first responders, etc.

I remember that day like yesterday. I took my radio on the street, people gathered round and not said a word, just listened.   These New Yorkers looked totally dazed.  Like Pearl Harbor, a day that will live in infamy.

George Bush could NOT protect American people from terorist. LOOK at THIS, September 11 ATTACT came when BUSH was president. He spent money for IRAK & AFGANISTAN for ZERO Result. WMD NEVER be found and He could NOT Find & Kill Bin Ladin. 
Bush flew onto that aircraft carrier with that big banner MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!! but in reality the only one who accomplished anything was Bin Laden and we are still there. 
Bush & Cheney used SCARE TACTIC to american people.
BUSH made BIG DEBT & RECESSION for this country. He got SURPLUS when He was president from BILL Clinton. He ended with BIG DEFICIT for this country.

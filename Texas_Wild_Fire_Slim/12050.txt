Firefighters contain more of Texas wildfire










BASTROP, Texas (AP) — Fire officials in Texas say they’re making progress in containing a massive wildfire in the Bastrop area, but they’re concerned about winds picking up and creating more hotspots.

The fire has been burning for almost a week and destroyed nearly 1,400 homes.
A spokesman for a team of federal agencies responding to the fire said Saturday it’s 40 percent contained. That’s an increase over the 30 percent figure officials gave Friday.



But Jack Horner says fire crews are worried because infrared cameras detected more hotspots Friday night.
He says winds are expected to pick up from 3 to 6 mph Saturday morning to 14 to 19 mph by the afternoon and fire crews are worried that could fuel more hotspots.
Bastrop is about 30 miles east of Austin.

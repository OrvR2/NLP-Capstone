NFL: Texans Crush Manning-less Colts

The Indianapolis Colts looked lost without Peyton Manning and the Houston Texans took advantage, with Matt Schaub  threw for 220 yards and a touchdown in a 34-7 rout Sunday.
Ben Tate rushed for 116 yards and another score as he subbed for injured Arian Foster, and the Texans dominated Kerry Collins, Manning’s replacement.
Manning, the four-time MVP, didn’t even travel with the team to Houston as he recovers from his third neck surgery in the past 19 months. The Colts lured the 38-year-old Collins out of retirement less than three weeks ago to take a crash course in the offense, and that looked like a bad option in the opener.

300lb SUES FASTFOOD RESTAURANT BECAUSE HE CANT FIT IN THE BOOTHS

*Sigh* Martin Kessman, 64, is suing White Castle over claims he could not fit in booths at the chain’s restaurant in Nanuet, New York. He claims White Castle offered him free hamburgers in responses to three separate complaints – but he still had to pay extra for cheese.
(DailyMail)–The stockbroker alleges in a lawsuit filed at Manhattan federal court that the fast food chain broke its promises to make the booths bigger.
‘They’re stationary booths,’ he told the New York Post. ‘I’m not humongous (but) I’m a big guy. I could not wedge myself in.’
Mr Kessman claims he hurt his knee after knocking it against a metal support bar on the table and complained to company headquarters.
‘There were no tables and chairs that could accommodate a person that merely wanted to sit down and eat his meal,’ he alleged.
Mr Kessman added that he has never had any trouble sitting down at other fast food restaurants or on aeroplanes.
When he was offered three free hamburgers in each of three apology letters sent by the company, he sent his wife to pick them up.
‘I did not want to set foot into the store,’ he said. ‘Any subsequent trips to the store have been made by my wife – I have been like an outcast.’
White Castle even said they would expand the seats and sent him design specifications, Mr Kessman alleged.
A White Castle spokesman told the New York Post that Mr Kessman could have asked a store manager for a regular chair.
White Castle claims to be the first hamburger chain, started in 1921, and was the first to sell a billion hamburgers.

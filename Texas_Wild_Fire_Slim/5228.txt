China paper warns of impact from euro crisis "Black Death"By Chris Buckley and Zhou Xin | Reuters – Mon, Aug 22, 2011






BEIJING (Reuters) - The "Black Death" of debt crisis across the euro zone will hurt China by sapping demand for exports, although Beijing's relatively small holdings of euro assets will limit any damage to foreign exchange reserves, the nation's top official newspaper said on Monday.
The bleak diagnosis for the euro's prospects appeared in the overseas edition of the People's Daily, the top newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, in a commentary by a former central bank official and an economist for the state-owned China Development Bank.
The commentary in the People's Daily does not reflect a definitive view from China's top leaders, but it suggests the euro zone's successive crises have stirred anxiety and debate in Beijing about the impact on China.
"The euro debt crisis has now been going for nearly two years since the end of 2009, and the sovereign debt crisis has spread like the Black Death of the fourteenth century across the euro zone countries," said the commentary, referring to the rodent-borne pandemic that devastated Europe.
The commentary came days before French President Nicolas Sarkozy is due to meet Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing for impromptu talks that will probably focus on the recent turbulence in global financial markets.
"The spread of the euro debt crisis will not have as large an impact on our country's foreign exchange reserves as the U.S. sovereign debt downgrade, because euro assets make up far less of our country's foreign exchange reserves than the dollar," added the authors, Zhang Zhixiang, a former head of the People's Bank of China international department, and Zhang Chao, an economist for the China Development Bank.
"But the euro debt crisis will lead to a decline in real demand that will have a far-reaching impact on our country's real economy," they wrote.
About a quarter of China's record foreign currency reserves of more than $3 trillion are held in euro assets, analysts estimate.
RESTORE CONFIDENCE
It was not clear, however, that the commentary signaled China would take a tougher stance in discussions during Sarkozy's visit.
Wang He, a researcher with a Chinese government think tank, said Sarkozy and Hu have a shared interest in portraying Europe's troubles as manageable.
"Neither leader will miss the opportunity to voice their joint commitment to stabilizing global markets, and that should help to restore investment confidence to some extent," said Wang, who studies European economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
He also played down the likelihood of Europe's crisis spinning out of control.
"I don't expect Europe to solve its debt problem overnight, but we must see that Europe has the financial capability to prevent it from spreading like a disease," he said.
"It is certainly overly pessimistic to say that the euro zone is falling apart."
The 27-member EU bloc is China's biggest trade partner, with bilateral trade in goods in 2010 reaching 395 billion euros ($570 billion), a rise of 13.9 percent, according to EU statistics. Chinese exports to the EU reached 281.9 billion euros in 2010, a rise of 18.9 percent on 2009.
Chinese leaders, including Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, have repeatedly expressed confidence that debt-laden European countries can overcome their problems and return to healthy growth.
During a visit to Germany in June, Wen said his country could buy the sovereign debt of some troubled euro zone nations if needed.
But the People's Daily said the euro zone's problems reflected deep-seated institutional failings that needed to be overcome for Europe to recover confidence and strong growth.
"The euro zone should reform the institutional constraints to economic development, and show a responsible attitude regarding the links between their countries' and their region's economic development and global economic and financial stability," wrote the two economists.

The Song says "God Bless the Child That Got It's Own. So much for the global economy or new world order. This is what happens when greed rules. All these corporations that moved to China to use the slave labor over there have created a new monster that is gorging itself to death and taking the world with it.

I suspect that the U.S. is stealthily monetizing it's debt.  China suspects it but what can it do?  Without American markets what are they going to do with all those plastic bowls and shoes?

I love it because China is going to collapse, and its great because you see all the resentful and hateful third world #$%$ cheering at the prospect. Its fudging its numbers, its artificially devaluing its currency and is building hundreds of useless make-ship projects like ghost cities and empty malls, when China pops its going to make the US housing market pale in comparison.

The Chinese government is actually in a precarious position.  More than a billion people are beginning to desire middle class goods and services, not to mention those in the country side who simply want to eat.  This takes a lot of money. The current U.S. population is far easier to provide for given its size of 307 million.  Any disruption in natural resources or a major economic "hiccup" could set off a powder keg. One could argue that China's huge population is actually its Achilles heel.

China has quite the ponzi scheme going between the U.S. and Europe.  They prop up U.S. dollars by buying U.S. debt while holding their YUAN low to guarantee unrestrained exports.  The U.S. companies in China get the cheap labor and reap massive profits from the under valued Chinese currency and the almost tariff free imports to the U.S. economy.  The U.S. politicians keep their campaign coffers flush with cash and China's GDP booms while the U.S. trade deficit and unemployment sore to new heights.  Also China has HIGH tariffs one imports to ensure no once can compete with their economy.  Wow.  They have the nerve to wag their finger at other economies while they have full control of competition and wages in theirs.  Will we all wake up and realize what is happening?  Look around you.  A new phenomena is taking hold in the U.S.  There are millions of people in the U.S. that have a job but are still on welfare because the jobs don't pay enough for them to survive. And our government continues down this Free Trade road.

Ralph, I agree with you. We HAVE to spread the message.
NO MORE CHINESE JUNK!   Read the label. Stop buying the "cheapest"
and buy the best "value".  Just SAY NO TO CHINESE.
We signed on to FAIR TRADE,  Not UN-FAIR TRADE.

Want to send a message to China? Stop buying their crap... Want to send a message to the corporations who dismantled our manufacturing base and sent it to China to bolster the CEO's bonus? Stop buying China's crap. Want to send a message to the 'Big-Box marts that have driven the world on a race to the bottom? Stop buying their crap. Seek out local artisans, own less, love more.

Since history is repeating itself, that must mean that Europe never learned their lessons....Westerners always think that everyone wants to be like them, but that isn't always the case....America started this mess by selling subprime mortgages and allowing them to be packaged as AAA securities.....Either way we own your hide, Lightningav!!!

Aloha;
 The Chinese also need to remember what was the root cause of the Black Death: The
little mouses from China, that got on board the ship and multiply and spread disease
across Europe.

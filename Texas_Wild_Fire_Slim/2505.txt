Sometimes a video is just nice. Ya know? It reassures you that there are pleasant, good things out there, and that we're all gonna be okay, and ugh, isn't it wonderful to be a living, breathing human on a planet full of other living, breathing humans? 
This is one of those videos.
It's just people laughing, sure, but it's still. so. nice.

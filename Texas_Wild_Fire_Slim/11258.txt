Central Texas Wildfire Quilt Drive
We are hoping you will send us one of your own quilts.
We are working to give every child who has lost everything in the Central Texas wildfires a quilt to sleep under.
Our goal is a quilt for every child who lost their home.
Quilts should be at least 45” x 60”, although twin size bed quilts are encouraged.
We will accept crib or baby quilts 45” x 60” or smaller on behalf of The Linus Connection of central Texas. They will be donating these quilts to infant victims of the fires.Please ship quilts to Valli & Kim Quilt Shop, Attn: Wildfire Quilts, 700 West Highway 290, Dripping Springs, TX 78620.

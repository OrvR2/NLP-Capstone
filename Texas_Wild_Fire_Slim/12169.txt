The Forest Legacy Application includes two documents. The first is the Application Guide, which describes the process in detail and provides vital information for landowners interested in participating in the Texas Forest Legacy Program. The Application Guide also provides instructions for completing the application. The application itself is a form that can be printed out and completed by hand, or it can be completed electronically. Please note that if you complete the form electronically, you still must print it out in order to sign the document.Interested landowners will also find a completed sample application to further assist them in determining what to include in the application. The information included in the sample application was taken from the top rated project of 2010. Application GuideApplicationSample Application

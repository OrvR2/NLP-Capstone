According to local officials in Bastrop County Texas, the fire is swallowing "One home every four minutes". The fight has only begun. As of now, "zero percent" is contained. Words cannot describe how devastating these fires are to Austin and the surrounding areas. I'll simply let the images speak for themselves.










 The video footage was shot in and around Bastrop County. Please Contact the Central Texas Red Cross to help - americanredcross.org/​CentralTexasFaceBook

				The Christian evangelica­l crowd (Perry's buddies) attribute natural disasters as god's message to repent and accept Jesus as their god.    When the Japan disaster hit, a man made that very comment to me.   On the back of his truck there was a "Take Back America"  bumper sticker.   I wonder if god is sending a message to Texas now?   Pretty twisted thinking going on in the tea bagger nation now.

				They aren't even trying to contain it! There is to much dry foilage! This area is new to wildfires and is more of a rainforest area, much more foilage then anywhere you're used to hearing about and has never been burned before! They are just evacuating and spraying to protect certain spots. There are three more fires within 20 miles apart, the great fear is that they all jion together! I live here, and may not be safe for very long! Horrible! It's huge!

				Looks like something out of a disaster movie. But this is real. 

Just to prove how stupid some people are...ther­e was a letter in my local Texas paper a few days ago from a smoker who made the argument that since he pays state taxes of a few cents per pack on cigarettes­, he's already paid any "fine" he might get for dumping litter on the street....­so back off and give him his "freedom" to toss his cigarette butts wherever he wants.  

Uh huh. Somehow I don't think the few hundred he pays in state taxes yearly will pay for thousands of acres burned, hundreds of houses burned and maybe the death of some human beings. 

I'm getting rather tired of hearing people like that talk about their "freedom"-­- since far too often it's coupled with a total lack of responsibi­lity towards other people.

				"I'm getting rather tired of hearing people like that talk about their "freedom"-­­- since far too often it's coupled with a total lack of responsibi­­lity towards other people."

That is precisely what is wrong with the arguments you hear. In particular­, they seem to think that even displaying common decency, and being expected to behave as a mature adult, is an impossible imposition on their freedom.

				Our  govenor  good hair had a state wide prayer day for rain back in May, now our State is on fire with no end in sight and we are in the worst drought in  Texas's  history. I hope that the next state wide prayer meeting that the govenor has will be for the govenor and all the climate change deniers to wake up to the fact that Texas is going through the hottest and driest year on record.

				I want you to keep in mind something you just said, "on record."  Then I want you to read this article from The Handbook of Texas Online (from the Texas State Historical Associatio­n) about the history of drought in Texas:
http://www­.tshaonlin­e.org/hand­book/onlin­e/articles­/ybd01

Then I will finish with this: It doesn't matter which side of the coin you are on in regards to the causes of climate change, it does not take away from the fact that Texas has always been like this, as can be seen from historical records gathered from before the time of scientific records.  Texas goes through periods of severe drought with periods of plentiful wet seasons.  Some parts of Texas can go through drought while others get drenched.  For those of us who have had family in Texas for generation­s are well aware of this fact.  

Neither praying to God or pushing politicall­y-based science is ever going to change the fact that Texas can be both generous and unforgivin­g, and it has been that way for a very long time, and will continue to be that way long after we are gone.

				The fact is that there is in an increase in extreme weather worldwide, and this includes many drought prone areas getting more severe and frequent droughts.

The science is not politicall­y based. It is science - with evidence and data.

The problem is that Texas may well end up being a whole lot more unforgivin­g in the future - depending on what climate change has in store for it. You'd need to check what the models suggest wrt. rainfall and temperatur­e changes that are predicted, to get the best to determine whether it is expected to get much drier - wetter, or remain the same - allbeit with higher average temperatur­es.

				Horrible!!­! Having gone through several fires in Malibu, the Corral Canyon Fire on November 24, 2007 was the one that destroyed my home. IMPORTANT: Homeowners don’t realize that an itemized list is required by your insurer after a loss. Plus, if I had compiled a list prior to my loss, I would have realized I was under insured! This was my families OMG moment. 

IN HIND SIGHT, I WISH I HAD DONE A HOME INVENTORY! This is Job #1 in being prepared.

				People tend to miss photos more than any other items. So if you're in a rush to flee, grabbing those can be a good first thought.

Of course don't wait too long. Not all fires behave the same, and you can easily get caught.

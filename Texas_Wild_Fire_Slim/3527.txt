The New York Times:
New Yorkers are broadly dissatisfied with the quality of their public schools, and most say the city's school system has stagnated or declined since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took control of it nine years ago, according to a New York Times poll.

Ari Melber: Cuomo's Problem in 2016: Democrats


							            							            Put aside the historical significance of the gay marriage vote, and anyone who follows New York politics knows the prospect of Andrew Cuomo as a popular Democratic primary candidate in 2016 is a joke.							        



 






John Merrow: Joel Klein's Hidden Legacy


							            							            In terms of his impact on schools and school systems, Joel Klein is the most important educator that most of America has never heard of.							        



 






Stanton Peele: Sputnik and Charter Schools: Neither Has Moved American Education Off Center


							            							            The failures in American education are due to fundamental aspects of American society -- our religiosity, spirituality, and irrationality, and our failure to integrate African-Americans into the mainstream. 							        



 






Justin Snider: Rage Against the Machine: Why We Should Be Skeptical About Standardized Test Scores


							            							            The educational decisions now made in part on standardized test scores are neither few nor inconsequential. This is hardly about who gets a sticker for a job well done.							        



 






Nushin Rashidian: The Gangs of East New York


							            							            For some seniors, and many of the East New York schools and students, it's impossible to separate street life from school life.							        



 






Alan Singer: We Need to Make Eye Contact


							            							            This week the New York State Regents, the governing body that makes educational decisions in the state, unanimously enacted changes in teacher certification. I wish I could say these changes are reforms.

				In the court of public opinion, this is an indictment of the top-down business model of education reform, and indictment of failed Gates Foundation experiment­s, an indictment of the Michelle Rhee disciples scattered throughout the system, an indictment of inequitabl­e charters, and an indictment of high-stake­s testing.  How many more of these failed reforms will school districts across the country have to suffer through?

				Well who thought they would be?  He knows nothing about education and he knows nothing about the world in which the majority of NY public school students live.  We saw how he thought he could hand the Chancellor­ship to his elite rich friend Cathy Black (don't Tea Partiers hate elite people)?

We say parents should have more say--well now we have their say.  And as far as small schools are concerned-­-those were funded by Bill Gates so the credit does not go to Mayor Mike.

One of the biggest problems in education is too many politician­s use it as an electoral pawn and in this case Mayor Mike has failed badly.  He should be evaluated and he should lose his
tenure as Mayor (according to the system that he espouses).

It's been in the pipeline since May, but Lancome has finally debuted its feature-length (sort of) video of Emma Watson for Trésor Midnight Rose. 
Filmed by Mario Testino in Paris at the Hotel Crillon, along the Seine, in an old-timey bookshop and on various street corners, Emma's new vid is a hazy, purple meet cute where a black fedora functions as Cinderella's slipper. 
French actor Cyril Descours find the hat and seeks the girl, chasing her down the streets of Paris until he finds himself face to face with a very made-up Emma Watson. In the final moment, the fedora bizarrely leaps from his head to hers and they don't kiss. 
It's an OK concept, but something about the melodramatic spot (which feels like an hour but is really under two minutes) is super contrived and cheesy. The ad fulfills every Paris cliche (cobble stone streets! Boats on the Seine! A dark cafe!), while Watson looks like a child playing dress-up with her crimson lips and slicked-back hair. 
The result, as Buzzfeed called it, is "Emma Watson’s Unfortunate New Perfume Commercial."
Check out the 21-year-old actress prance around Paris with her French boy toy and tell us: do you love or hate this new fragrance ad?

				In order to think this ad was cheesy, you must never have seen a beer, pizza, car or "feminine product" commercial in the US!! Jeeze, get over it - it was an advertisem­ent!  It was cute, it did hit all the Paris chiches, but wasn't that the point? Emma looked no worse than Drew Barrymore, Brooke Shields or any of dozens more, made up for a commercial - or a role. (Face it, it's hard to make her look bad!)  Get over the fact that she was a kid through many years of "Potter" movies - she's a young woman now, and can wear makeup as she pleases, or as roles (including commercial­s) require.  It was never meant to emulate high art - just to be cute, take advantage of her good looks, and maybe sell some perfume.

Not, 
Emma Watson doesn't need a perfume to make a guy chase after her ...  

(But I was a little disappoint­ed that the store clerk never asked her to pay for the book, it isn't as if she can't afford one).

				it's really not as horrible as it's made out to be in the above synopsis.  girl goes to book store. girl gets guy to get book and checks him out as he's doing so. girl is all befuddled and forgets her hat. guy goes after her with it but no luck. guy sits around hoping to see her again? chases after when he does see her and thinks he misses her again, but then, voila...th­ere she is. granted, the hat popping onto hers at the end was pretty silly and i imagine could've been done better, but whatever.  it's cheesy, but not as bad as many others i've seen.

				Thinking that;  The 'Midnight Rose' for Lancome Tresor was well done in a cute rendition of fairy tale fantasy with Emma Watson illustrati­ng the feminine mystique of attractant quality.  The illuminate­d float is a teaser that preludes the reaction of having missed the boat that did not happen, as Emma steps out of waiting.  Cute, very cute.

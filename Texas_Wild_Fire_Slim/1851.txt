Obama's jobs speech: Will it rescue his plummeting popularity?The Week – 23 hrs ago





As the president's approval numbers continue to crater, the White House hopes Obama's plan to fight unemployment will reverse the trendPresident Obama's poll numbers have sunk to their lowest yet, and the public's despondency about the economy and persistently high unemployment has only deepened. Obama will address a joint session of Congress on Thursday, in what's being built up as a major speech on jobs. Though the public reviles Congress even more than Obama, the president's sinking approval rating casts serious doubt on his re-election prospects. Can he say anything on Thursday to reverse his political fate?
 One speech won't do much:  Obama's terrible poll numbers "should set off loud warning bells" at his campaign headquarters, say Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake in The Washington Post. A growing majority of Americans say they're not better off than before Obama took office, and dismiss his economic policies as ineffective. He won't win next year unless he truly convinces voters that he's actually making things better, not just orating. "He's not there yet. Or even close.""President Obama's 'are you better off' problem"
 An aggressive speech would put Obama back on top:  Thursday's speech is "Obama's last best chance to reverse his downward spiral," says Thomas DeFrank in the New York Daily News. He doesn't have to conjure up a magic jobs bullet — he can win if there's "even modest job-creation progress." But he has to show disillusioned Democrats and independents that he's in charge, which means ditching "the kumbaya routine" and calling out "Republicans to their face for their opportunistic obstructionism.""Obama's jobs speech to Congress is his last, best chance to reverse..."
 And if Obama doesn't go bold, he should go home:  "Republicans won't pass anything he proposes," says Eliot Spitzer at Slate. But Obama won't win back voters by complaining about it. "He will need to demonstrate a boldness we haven't seen from him in some time," then challenge Congress to enact his "transformational ideas": A jobs program that employs millions, slaps tariffs on Chinese goods, and allows federal mortgage refinancing. But sadly, if Obama's past is any guide, we shouldn't hold our breath for him to come out swinging."Obama's last chance?"View this article on TheWeek.com Get 4 Free Issues of The WeekOther stories from this topic:Best Column: Obama and the 'road to serfdom'Opinion Brief: 5 theories why Obama is going on 'The View'Opinion Brief: Obama on 'The View': Unpresidential?Like on Facebook - Follow on Twitter - Sign-up for Daily Newsletter

There is one thing that can rescue O'Blah Blah's plummeting reputation. In his jobs speech tomorrow, he should announce that he will NOT run for another term as President.

Of course it will rescue the presidents popularity. But since no one think the man has a clue, only Nancy and Harry will pretend to take it seriously. And maybe Katie and Brian and whoever is on ABC will feign interest for a day or two.

I think the title of this article says it all.  This is all about helping Obama, not the country.

ANOTHER Obama speech where he announces more stimulus spending and more of the exact same policies that haven't worked at all.  Which the Republicans won't pass anyway, because they don't work.

Yes that will really turn Obama and the Country's fortunes around.

Let's get this worthless tool out of office ASAP.  Perry in 2012 !!

No, his speech will not help him or anyone else in this country.  He's hoping it will buy him some union votes.  But at the same time, it will just convince more Americans that he is a complete and utter failure, devoid of new ideas, and without any sort of realistic plan for the future.  He is not a wise person.  A wise person would at least learn something by his own mistakes.  He just repeats his own mistakes.

Obama won't stand a chance if the 2012 Republican candidate shows Obama's record against his key campaign issues:
1. Get out of Iraq (still there, and added troops in Afghanistan and added a new war without Congressional approval)
2. Close Gitmo (won't happen) 
3. Increase employment 
4. Transparency (passed Obamacare without allowing Congress or America read the bill - it was well within his power to post the bill online or televise the negotiations as promised during his campaign)
5. Get lobbyists out of the White House (he has a long list of lobbyists, union heads, and commuinists that are czars and that consult him regularly - check the White House visitor log)
6. He promised to never sign a bill with pork, then signed the $1 trillion stimulus bill, which was 100% pork. Furthermore, had to include pork in Obamacare to bribe his own party to vote for it. 

Candidate Obama was an idealistic, naive fool. Or a liar.

Aside from these issues, he 
1. Has crippled oil production in the US by freezing all drilling applications
2. Threatens to increase taxes on businesses and investors in every speech he makes (which is why there are trillions of dollars not being invested right now), 
3. Has stifled the recovery with heavy regulatory requirements at every opportunity. This includes Obamacare, which has more regulations than any bill ever passed - and there is more to come. The bill requires most regulations to be written by committees that were formed after the bill was passed. 
4. Wants to spend like crazy, but thinks that military spending must be cut. How is military spending less stimulative than the billions in ridiculous research projects funded by the Stimulus package? Yet he pushes for military cuts, which will make the country weaker during a time of massive global strife. 
5. Has not passed a budget since he has been in office. 
6. Increased spending 24% since he took office, which spurred the formation of the Tea Party and led to our debt downgrade. His favorite word is unsustainable, yet he seems to think that borrowing 40% of what we spend is sustainable.
7. Doesn't have anyone on his staff that is committed to growing private sector jobs in the US. Obama's jobs Czar, GE's Immelt, just outsourced thousands of jobs to China. 
8. Annually, he declares that he will not sleep until he improves the jobs situation. He did it when he was elected, then took a break to develop the shovel ready jobs stimulus program (which turned out to be a flop because there are no shovel ready jobs - by his own admission), then started on jobs, then took a break for a year while he did Obamacare (which has put the breaks on jobs while HHS develops the monstrous regulatory requirements for insurance and employers), thn he got started on jobs, then took a break to pass Cap and Trade (another job killer and economy killer, which failed - thankfully), then started on jobs, until the debt ceiling debate, now he is vacationing so e can work on the economy and jobs. Does he have ideas that he has held in reserve until now? If so, why? 

If you can't win against this record, you are not trying.

He did it when he was elected, then took a break to develop the shovel ready jobs stimulus program (which turned out to be a flop because there are no shovel ready jobs - by his own admission), then started on jobs, then took a break for a year while he did Obamacare (which has put the brakes on jobs while HHS develops the monstrous regulatory requirements for insurance and employers), then he got started on jobs, then took a break to pass Cap and Trade (another job killer and economy killer, which failed in Congress, but he intends to implement through the EPA).  Then he started on jobs until the debt ceiling debate.  Now he intends to promote a plan for the economy and jobs.  Does he have ideas that he has held in reserve until now?  If so, why?

little O and read the teleprompter all he wants, but that only employs the tech who runs the thing.  Beyond teleprompter techs, he has not show any ability to create jobs.  But I will give him create for making a bull market for teleprompter techs.

The last comment nailed it.  Unless Obama is willing to go "all in" with the speech, there is no point in giving it.  

And going "all in" means hammering the GOP day and day out when they refuse to cooperate with his plan, even if it means cancelling fundraising events and conducting TV interviews, bashing them constantly that they are only looking to win next year regardless of the cost to Americans.

I haven't seen Obama do that yet and not hopeful that he will start this late in the game.

BASTROP, Texas -- The flames of the massive wildfire that had swallowed nearly 1,400 homes in Central Texas had been tamed, but Webster Fire Chief Patrick Shipp and his crew – veterans of a fire season pushing his team to the limit – know the danger doesn't end there.
Carrying a 40-pound safety pack and protective clothing covering nearly every inch of skin, Shipp and his team hunt down hot spot after hot spot in the Bastrop area, where one of the most destructive wildfires in the state's history has burned for a week. Heavy ash paints a bleak, almost monochrome landscape. It's hard to breathe. Every 10 minutes or so, Shipp squirts Visine in his eyes to ease the sting.
"Every step you take is like a dust storm all around you, it's pretty surreal," Shipp said.
It's a familiar environment for Shipp and hundreds of other firefighters who have spent the past several months battling blazes across the state, and there's little sign of relief. Shipp has been deployed two other times from his home 160 miles away from Bastrop, and he knows the fight won't end anytime soon.
"We'll probably leave here and go somewhere else," Shipp said.
Texas is suffering its worst wildfire outbreak in state history. The Bastrop-area fire has been the largest of nearly 190 wildfires the Texas Forest Service says erupted this week, leaving nearly 1,700 homes statewide in charred ruins, killing four people and forcing thousands of people to evacuate.
The forecast for the months ahead offers little optimism. A La Nina weather pattern is setting up across the region that will likely sustain the dry, windy conditions that are so crucial to sparking and sustaining dangerous fires like the one near Bastrop.
Since Texas' fire season began in December, local and state firefighters have responded to more than 20,900 wildfires that have consumed about 3.6 million acres – roughly the size of the state of Connecticut.
Shipp is among firefighters from around the state who are battling the blaze through the Texas Intrastate Fire Mutual Aid System – a Texas Forest Service program that uses local departments to help in major blazes and other emergencies. They're working alongside teams of federal and local firefighters against the Bastrop fire, which officials say is about 40 percent contained.
 Hundreds of firefighters from Texas and nationwide have been sleeping and resting at Camp Swift, a National Guard post near the blaze, with engines from cities around the state crowding a field as they returned from Thursday's shift. By Thursday night, firefighters said the largest flames had been tamed and they were now focusing on putting out hotspots and ensuring homes were safe for resident to return.
As they rested at the camp and prepared themselves for another long day ahead, firefighters acknowledged the weariness of chasing blaze after blaze.
"It wears you down, but it's what we do," said Jim Rodgers, chief of Northeast Fire and Rescue in Humble, Texas, who was working alongside Shipp.
Shipp said the intensity of the fire on the first day was unlike anything he had seen.
"We would mark a place on the map and say, `We're not going to let the fire get there,' but when the fire would get there, it would jump over us," Shipp said. "We would have to retreat to the next road and finally made our last stand before we got beat again."
Since the start of the year, Shipp and his crew – a collection of 11 firefighters from five fire departments – have battled wildfires in West Texas in the spring and in Midway earlier this summer. They already were eyeing fires in Montgomery County that they expected to be dispatched next.
"This crew has missed Easter, Father's Day, Memorial Day, the 9/11 anniversary and my kid's first football game," Shipp said. When he returned Thursday night, Shipp had received a text message that his 12 year-old son's team won the game earlier that evening.
The impact on the state's firefighters is undeniable, officials say.
"There's no doubt that this fire season has taken its toll on fire departments in Texas," said Chris Barron, executive director of the State Firemen's and Fire Marshal's Association of Texas.
Barron, whose group has set up a fund to raise money to buy protective equipment and clothing for volunteer firefighters, said it's too early to say what the physical and emotional impact on the state's firefighters will be from this season.
And, Barron notes, "Fire season isn't even close to being over yet."
Those who may be feeling the most fatigue are volunteer departments, which make up 77 percent of the state's firefighting force.
Scott Sutcliffe, assistant chief of the Heart of Pines volunteer fire department in Bastrop County, said only two of the department's 24 firefighters saw their homes spared by the wildfires. Sutcliffe, whose wife is also a firefighter for the department, lost his home.
He said he got his first full night's sleep on Tuesday night after working virtually non-stop over the weekend. Wednesday, the department told its firefighters to stand down because nearly all of their vehicles had been damaged by the wildfire.
Friday morning, Sutcliffe said his firefighters were back on the front line and worried about winds picking up.
"We're still just keeping on," he said.
The volunteer departments have relied on help from neighboring firefighters. That includes 15 firefighters from Arlington and one from San Antonio who traveled to Bastrop to help relieve the small volunteer department's firefighters. Several of the department's roughly 50 firefighters saw their homes destroyed by the wildfire.
"These guys just don't have a lot of people to pull from and they need some rest," said Russell Johnson, a battalion chief from the San Antonio Fire Department. "They're overwhelmed."

				Prior to this last budget, volunteer fire department­s around the state were at least getting block grants to help them buy equipment and pay for other expenses. As part of Rick Perry's "Texas miracle" budget these grants were cut to zero and the Texas Forest Service budget was slashed pretty heavily. Now you have some of these firefighte­rs working on the Bastrop fire having to buy their own equipment and clothing. The local Home Depot is sold out of respirator­s, for example. 

It turns out to be much worse than you stated. Volunteers are not only having to take away time from their work to fight fires but they have to pay money out of their own pocket for the privilege.

				RealNewsRe­porter.com is now reporting that volunteer firefighte­rs who had in some cases driven all night to reach Bastrop county were turned away by the feds, who claimed that since local officials never made a “formal request” for volunteers­, the volunteers could not be “activated­.”

So while Bastrop County burns from 40+ fires that are still raging, the federal government is actually telling volunteer firefighte­rs to go home.

				There's no mention of the "Feds" in this article: 

http://www­.statesman­.com/news/­local/volu­nteer-fire­fighters-t­urned-away­-in-bastro­p-official­s-say-1830­422.html

"’We may have had some of the world's finest firefighte­rs showing up, but if they weren't properly qualified or trained and had no equipment, we had no choice,’ said Mike Fisher, Bastrop County's emergency management director.

"’I hate to tell anybody, 'We don't need you,' but we absolutely didn't want to get anyone hurt.’

“At the same time, other local officials said many of the self-dispa­tched firefighte­rs brought no equipment with them and had inadequate training to fight the wildfires.­” 

Firefighti­ng is dangerous and requires trained TEAMS not over-zealo­us individual­s who can be a danger to themselves and others.  I'm sure there is plenty they can do where the firefighte­rs are camped and fed.

				Earlier this week, HuffPost reported that Gov. Rick Perry, the GOP front-runn­­er for president, had signed off on millions in firefighti­­ng cuts as part of the state's most recent budget legislatio­­n. The Texas Forest Service's funding has gone from $117.7 million in the 2010-2011 budget years to $83 million in the 2012-2013 budget years.

Severe cuts have also hit assistance grants to volunteer fire department­­s throughout Texas. The grants decreased from $30 million per year in 2010 and 2011 to $13.5 million per year in 2012 and 2013. These are cuts that firemen are now dealing with.
__________­­_________­_­________­__­_______­___­______­____­_____­_____­_

So since this is still 2011 how is this cut hurting the firefighte­­rs this year, or did they change this to 2012 while I wasn't looking?

				Seriously? The man has done nothing to actually help fight these fires, and very little to even look like he's helping. 

FEMA has paid up to 75% of the cost of fighting these fires... supporting every request received from Texas... while Perry went around the country criticizin­g Obama for refusing to provide assistance­. The feds issued disaster declaratio­ns for Texas in July and again this month.

What has Perry done to here, aside from cutting responder budgets mid-disast­er?

				How is asking a question about someting you don't know cherry picking. I don't live in Texas so I was not aware they started their 2012 budget in 2011. 

So let me ask this, how are the volunteers funded? Do they get moneis from taxes or just from fund raises etc? If they are funded by taxes why are they relying on grants to fund thier day to day expenses?

So it is true.

Sad.

				For the Firefighte­rs on the Line, its about Doing the Job as Safely as Possible.

Following what's called The;

10 Standard Fire Orders, 18 Situations that Shout "Watch Out" and 4 Common Denominato­rs of Fatal Fires.

Still, without the Proper Resources and Logistical Support, the Firefighte­rs will begin to Physically and Mentally "Break down"

While GOP TPer  Presidenti­al Candidate,  Gov. Rick Perry crosses the USA in his bid to become President, he has totally left his State of Texas to the Element of  Fire, by under cutting his Fire Services. It's an impossibil­ity to Totally Depend Upon the US Government to Fund this operation as he "Wishes" would happen, His State Has To Pay For It To.

It's A State of Texas Issue!

(This from a candidate that wants to "Make Government Inconseque­ntial in Everyone's daily life") I

Which is a Tragedy both locally and nationally­. The property losses in Tax Revenue has got to in the Hundreds of Millions.

While Texas is not a State like California­, which funds its Fire Department­s, he has in his Budgetary "Folly" sown the seeds of his States near destructio­n and hopefully:

Doomed his Presidenti­al Bid.

If he's failed at managing this Disaster, how could he handle something bigger?

				It is noteworthy that firefighte­r spokespeop­le have reserved their criticism of Gov. Perry for drasticall­y cutting their budgets. Ofcourse he is running for President and is a frontrunne­r now, and he is selling himself as such a successful leader superior to both Obama and his Texas predecesso­r. And, ofcourse, the firefighte­rs' union supported Perry in the last election..­.. I guess slamming him now would just hurt their pride too much, and expose the odd, hypocritic­al aspect of them supporting the anti-union Teapublica­ns.

If what his firefighte­rs are having to deal with now is indicative of Perry's vision for America, then not only should he be disqualifi­ed for the job, he should be scorned!  Where in the so-called "Liberal Media" is this song being trumpeted?

				These brave men and women deserve so much more than they are receiving from their state.
They should be secure in the knowledge that they will have access tot he equipment that they will need to function and for their own protection­.

				The state doesn't vote, people do. And more than 44% voted against Perry. 

Yes, the electoral college will assign its votes to the Republican candidate in 2012, but not because millions of Texans didn't vote for a Democrat. It could also have something to with the fact that Democrats seem bent on self-destr­uction.

Bing and Twitter got personal Tuesday evening, exchanging a series of public tweets to announce their relationship will continue.
It's no secret that Google dumped Twitter, nixing their "real-time" partnership this summer shortly after the launch of its own social network Google+.
But Twitter also had a deal with Bing, and that partnership lives on. TheNextWeb reports it "may yield the Microsoft search engine a competitive advantage over time."
Among the back-and-forth between the sites, Bing tweeted that they should "stick together and do bigger and better things," and Twitter responded, "We're in. Can't wait for what comes next." (Read the full conversation below.)
It didn't take long for Twitter users to spot the exchange. Angel investor Stefan Weitz tweeted, "Hey @bing and @twitter, get a room..."
Microsoft and Twitter first partnered in October 2009.

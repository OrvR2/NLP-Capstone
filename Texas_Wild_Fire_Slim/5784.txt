Everyone was up in arms over 15-year-old model Hailey Clauson. But is 14-year-old Kylie Jenner walking in Fashion Week bothering anyone?
Women's Wear Daily reported that the youngest daughter of Kris and Bruce Jenner (and Kim Kardashian's youngest sister) will be walking in Avril Lavigne's Abbey Dawn runway show (yep, Avril's got her own fashion show). 
The newspaper said that Kylie got the gig, which will feature her in three different looks at the Metropolitan Pavilion for Style 360, through her older brother Brody, who happens to be dating Lavigne. 
There are also rumors that older sibs Kim and Kourtney may sit front row, meaning lots more media attention for Lavinge's otherwise less-than-prestigious line.
But wait -- isn't Kylie just 14 years old? And didn't the CFDA and its president, Diane von Furstenberg, go on a campaign to crack down on underage models and recommend that any runway walkers be carded before stepping out to make sure they are at least 16 years?
Yes and yes. But Kylie walking for Abbey Dawn may be an acceptable exception: not only is she a Kardashian, for whom the rules of life do not apply, but she is also walking for Abbey Dawn, a line of mass-marketed tees, hoodies and other teen-appropriate clothing aimed specifically to "girls who are confident in their personal style and unafraid to express themselves through fashion," according to the Abbey Dawn website.

Slow, Steady Mitt Winning the Race
Defensive posture serving Romney well, Aaron Blake writes

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann have shot out of the gate in the GOP nomination contest, but “sometimes it’s slow-and-steady that gets it done,” writes Aaron Blake of the  Washington Post , and if there’s one thing Mitt Romney’s proven so far, it’s that he’...

Michele Got Her Mojo Back
Bachmann's HPV attack on Perry turned heads

(Newser) -
                                    Pundits seemed to all agree that Michele Bachmann was on the ropes heading into last night’s Tea Party debate—and now they all seem to agree that she fought her way back in with her  scathing indictment  of Rick Perry’s HPV vaccination program. Here’s what people are...

Debate Winners: Romney, Bachmann, Tea Party
Rick Perry-bashing pays off for rivals

(Newser) -
                                    It was "attack Rick Perry night" at last  night's GOP debate in Florida -—to the extent that even Jon Huntsman got in on the act—and the Texan's rivals succeeded in landing a few blows. Mitt Romney, who wisely ignored the Tea Party debate audience to...

Candidates Pile on Perry
Bachmann gets feisty again with spirited jabs

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry drew feisty attacks on stage and a few boos from the crowd at tonight's GOP debate in Florida, which also saw Michele Bachmann step it up a notch after fading in the first debate,  Politico  reports. Tonight kicked off with a fiery exchange on Social Security, when...

Social security and Tea Party topics likely to be big issues

(Newser) -
                                    Yes, it’s debate time again. Here’s what to watch for when the 2012 GOP presidential candidates face off tonight in Florida, at an event sponsored by CNN and the Tea Party Express:   Social Security will likely continue to be a flash point.

Ron Paul: Sorry, No 'Cross Words' With Perry
Says he doesn't even recall the exchange

(Newser) -
                                    Images of Rick Perry seemingly getting in Ron Paul's face during a TV break in this week's debate have triggered  all kinds of fun speculation  about what was going on, and now we've got explanations form both camps, notes Ben Smith of  Politico . Prepare to be disappointed....

Bachmann Is 'Done. Fini. Kaput.'
Critics agree: GOP debate confirmed she's just an 'afterthought' now

(Newser) -
                                    If the fat lady didn’t quite sing for Michele Bachmann at last night’s debate, she at least hummed a few notes, say the critics:   It was “remarkable” to see this once-top-tier candidate “relegated to an afterthought, getting barely as much face time as Herman Cain, Rick ...

Perry, Romney Tee Off
Texas governor makes his presidential debate debut

(Newser) -
                                    Rick Perry made his debate debut tonight, and it's clear the new frontrunner is happy to mix it up. He and Mitt Romney went after each other with gusto, notes  AP , as evidenced by an early exchange: After Perry criticized Romney's record of creating jobs in Massachusetts, Romney...

What to Watch for in Tonight's Debate
Will Perry make a good impression? Can Bachmann survive?

(Newser) -
                                    Sure, some of them have faced off before—but tonight’s Politico/NBC News debate marks the first time  new frontrunner Rick Perry  will join the fray, making it what  Politico  calls the “first Fall Classic” for 2012 GOP presidential hopefuls. And it’s the start of a busy month...

Bachmann: 'Submission' Means Respect
Candidate asked if she'd be submissive to her husband

(Newser) -
                                    Michele Bachmann believes wives should be submissive to their husbands—she has said she obtained a tax law degree only because her husband told her to—so would she remain submissive to her husband as president? That question from the Washington Examiner’s Byron York last night drew boos from...

Romney Unscathed in Iowa Debate
Front-runner stays above the fray as Minnesotans clash

(Newser) -
                                    Last night's  GOP debate in Iowa  was a testy affair, but Mitt Romney managed to stay above the fray and his front-runner status still isn't in doubt—at least until  Rick Perry enters the race,  pundits say.    "Neither the candidates nor the moderators did much to draw ...

Tonight's Ames Debate: What to Watch For
Bachmann, Romney, Pawlenty, et al fight for the No. 1 slot

(Newser) -
                                    There's  plenty riding on  Saturday's Ames Straw Poll, but have patience: The Ames debate comes first, and there's more than a little bit riding on that, too.  Politico  notes that while it's not the most important debate of the campaign, it is one that is likely...

Debate Helped Rick Perry, Hurt Palin
Why? Bachmann did well and Pawlenty didn't: Nate Silver

(Newser) -
                                    Acknowledging first that it's a little dicey to read too much into a debate so early in the process, Nate Silver ventures that last night's GOP forum might hurt the 2012 prospects of Sarah Palin and help those of Rick Perry, neither of whom took part. For Palin,...

Bachmann, Romney Score as Debate's 'Big Winners'
Bachmann impressed while Romney held firm, say pundits

(Newser) -
                                    Mitt Romney and, more surprisingly, Michele Bachmann looked like the big winners in last night's Republican debate in New Hampshire, analysts say.   Bachmann, who  announced her candidacy during the debate , was "at ease and forceful without looking at all crazy or out-of-control," writes EJ Dionne Jr. at ...

(Newser) -
                                    Good gimmick, or bad? At the  Republican debate in New Hampshire , CNN moderator John King occasionally departed from talking policy to ask GOP hopefuls a "this or that?" question.    To Rick Santorum: "Leno or Conan?" Leno, Santorum decided after a pause, "but I don't watch either....

                                    Gary Johnson won't be joining other Republican hopefuls for CNN's debate next week, and he's hopping mad about it.

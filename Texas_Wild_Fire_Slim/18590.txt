The hostility persists in Tripoli and the Libyan rebels continue the search for Gaddafi, but who is leading the rebels?  Who are the beneficiaries of the fall of Gaddafi? What will the blowback be for those in Libya and across the globe? Pepe Escobar, a correspondent for Asia Times, gives us some answers to these questions.Follow Lauren on Twitter: http://twitter.com/LaurenLyster

Are you serious, this guy has no source... at least not one he is willing to name or relinquish.
You people are such anti-americans that anyone can come up with no source or proof with anything that soils America and you will take it﻿ as genuine evidence.

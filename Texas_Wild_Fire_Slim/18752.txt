Public Pensions; A Ticking Time Bomb
1 comment






Prichard Alabama is the canary in the coal mine. Municipalities across the nation will be forced to confront the looming pension funding crisis. The town of Prichard stopped paying their pensioners and in the wake retired firefighters and other retired public servants have suffered.
Excerpt from CNBC via New York Times;
Prichard did something that pension experts say they have never seen before: it stopped sending monthly pension checks to its 150 retired workers, breaking a state law requiring it to pay its promised retirement benefits in full.
Since then, Nettie Banks, 68, a retired Prichard police and fire dispatcher, has filed for bankruptcy. Alfred Arnold, a 66-year-old retired fire captain, has gone back to work as a shopping mall security guard to try to keep his house. Eddie Ragland, 59, a retired police captain, accepted help from colleagues, bake sales and collection jars after he was shot by a robber, leaving him badly wounded and unable to get to his new job as a police officer at the regional airport.
Far worse was the retired fire marshal who died in June. Like many of the others, he was too young to collect Social Security. “When they found him, he had no electricity and no running water in his house,” said David Anders, 58, a retired district fire chief. “He was a proud enough man that he wouldn’t accept help.”
“Prichard is the future,” said Michael Aguirre, the former San Diego city attorney, who has called for San Diego to declare bankruptcy and restructure its own outsize pension obligations. “We’re all on the same conveyor belt. Prichard is just a little further down the road.”

Tragedy In Chicago, Two Firefighters Dead In Building Collapse
1 comment






Two Chicago Fire Department firefighters, Edward Stringer and Cory Ankum died in the line of duty today in a building collapse in a warehouse blaze.
ABC News reports;
Two Chicago firefighters were killed and more than a dozen injured Wednesday after they became trapped in a building while battling a warehouse blaze. Rescuers dug frantically to free the two, who were among at least four firefighters trapped inside the building. At least 15 other firefighters were hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries.
The Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed the deaths just before 11 a.m. Eastern time.
“Without warning the roof collapsed trapping four firefighters,” Chicago Fire Commissioner Robert Huff said at a press conference. “Despite our best efforts at the scene and in the hospitals, two firefighters succumbed to their injuries.”
Hoff identified the dead firemen as Edward Stringer and Cory Ankum. Stringer was a 12-year veteran firefighter.
Ankum, a 38-year-old father of three, was a three-year veteran of the Chicago police force when he switched careers and joined the fire department 16 months ago. His youngest child is just one year old.

Condolences to the families of Firefighters Edward Stringer and Cory Ankum. Too close to Christmas and children must be told their fathers are gone. This is the extreme definition of tragedy. R.I.P. Brothers.

40 Dead In Israel Wildfire, Burned In Bus Trying To Flee
2 comments






 AFP reports via Yahoo! News
HAIFA, Israel (AFP) – Around 40 people are believed to have been killed in a devastating forest fire raging out of control near Israel’s northern city of Haifa, the country’s ambulance service said on Thursday.
Officials described the inferno as among the worst in the nation’s history, with hundreds of firefighters on the ground and in the air battling to tame the blaze.
Israel’s ambulance service Magen David Adom said its paramedics were on the ground treating people caught in the flames.
“There are about 45 casualties, of whom about 40 are dead,” the ambulance service said in a statement.
Sources report winds of 17 mph and temps in the mid 80′s. Rather benign conditions all considered. This exemplifies the power of wildland fires.

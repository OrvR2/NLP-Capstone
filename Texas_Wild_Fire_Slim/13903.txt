Texas Parks and Wildlife releases video showing how fast a wildfire can spread
In the middle of historically gigantic wildfires in Texas (not helped at all by Gov. Rick Perry slashing funding for volunteer firefighters), the Texas Dept. of Parks and Wildlife released this video today showing how fast a wildfire can start and spread. Hope any and all Texan IHCers are out of the path of this thing.

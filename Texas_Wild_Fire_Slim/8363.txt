Mugabe urges firms to comply with equity lawAFP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011




Related ContentZimbabwean President Robert Mugabe delivers a speech in August 2011 in Harare. Mugabe …

President Robert Mugabe on Tuesday urged foreign companies to comply with a looming deadline to submit their plans for selling majority stakes to black Zimbabweans under a controversial equity law.
Foreign firms have until September 25 to present their plans to government on how they will comply with the law that requires them to sell 51 percent stakes to locals.
Mugabe insisted that foreign investments in the county would be safe, if they meet the new requirements.
"As the implementation of the indigenisation and empowerment policy continues to gather momentum, government looks forward to full co-operation by all stakeholders to achieve a win-win outcome," Mugabe said as he opened a new session of parliament.
"I wish to assure investors that their investments in the country remain safe and urge them to comply with the country's laws."
Mines and banks are the main target of the law, but Finance Minister Tendai Biti said two weeks ago that the rules could be relaxed for banks.
The equity law is strongly supported by 87-year-old Mugabe but has created tensions within Zimbabwe's rocky unity government, with Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai arguing that it will discourage investment.
The new session of parliament is expected to debate a new law governing diamond mines. Exports of the gems have been restricted since 2009 over concerns about rights abuses in diamond fields.
Lawmakers also must approve a law to govern the holding of a referendum on a new constitution, a key step toward new elections under Zimbabwe's three-year-old unity accord.
Mugabe, whose ZANU-PF party was blamed for most of the deadly violence that undermined Zimbabwe's last elections in 2008, called for peace as the country moves toward new polls.
"As we forge ahead, let us continue to exert our energy in fostering unity, peace, development and equality of opportunity of all our people," he said.
"Let us therefore in unison say no to violence in all its manifestations.
Mugabe has already been endorsed as his party's candidate in the new elections, likely to again pit him against Tsvangirai in polls expected next year.

In the 1970s, Idi Amin expelled foreigners from Uganda and tried to run his country with just the natives but it failed miserably because blacks have a very low average IQ.

So lets get this into perspective. The black Africans insist on implementing an apartheid style law where whites may not own these companies or at least majority shares in those companies? I would agree with Aussea, burn the darn things down and save everyone the trouble of watching the Africans screw up again. How would it be if I, as a white man decided to do this and insist that it must be majority white owned., mmm, dont think I would get away with it somehow.

Mugabe and his cronies stole the countries agricultural base and reduced productive and wealthy farmlands, capable of not only feeding the population but of exporting food products all over the continent, to bankrupt wasteland.  With no money coming in from that theft, he now turns his attention to Industry, the last bastion keeping the country afloat, albeit barely. The country has not got foreign currency to purchase a loaf of bread, so where are the funds to purchase coming from? Undoubtedly from the billions Mugabe and cohort have stashed away in Swiss bank accounts, or more likely in some invented currency that will be paid at sometime in the indeterminate future from profits local industry may or not make.
Africa is a basket case of medieval tribal dictatorships now, this moronic neanderthal, who bases his rhetoric on North Korean politics and policies, (and we all know how well they are doing), has distinguished himself by singlehandedly reversing the evolution of his nation to almost pre-historic times.

I saw that Mugabe has inoperable cancer. I don't think that the Zanu-PF people will be around for much longer. (For the sake of everyone that lives within the region, let's hope it's sooner rather than later).

How old is Mugabe ?? 87 ??? well, I guess his time is over anyway. But surely , its nothing but right, to share whites wealth with the new Zimbabwe. You people cant just go, steel someones country,use their resources..and then u say," but i have been soooo good to those blacks, we have fed them, we have given them houses, we have given them food..  you can talk to your dog like that, even him, treated bad, he will eat you !!! Change your heart, live in peace, Mugabe will go...the next might be better....its their country , even if mistakes done, its THEIR problem and right to do them.   Would you want Africa to get into american problems and tell you what to do ???  ( and dont give me the crap about OBAMA being african and whatever....he is an AMERICAN !!!)  USA is a multiracial country....you are just one of those races.... Africa is a beautiful country to live in, but you always will be a visitor...and it is good... help them... but also learn....but stop misusing those countries.Money and development is not everything !!!  I have seen a country, a colony, totaly used , cut trees, teaching wrong things, when nothing was left for them....whites left...." We give you FREEDOM " Great... all trees were cut down , sold....draught started....now , people say ::Look at those monkeys...they cant even use their freedom!!!  Oh,and also their religions, they left for them....now africa is sitting with two religions, basicly not theirs, ripped of their culture, and still we use them...not colonial ?? it is , but in another way....now its money, we lure them with, because they have something you want....You want those wide lands, you want those diamonds, gold , oil,    you say:  AFRICA IS GOOD; BUT TOO MANY BLACKS IN IT !!!   Thats you ,people!!!   But you are not Columbus "discovering" America, ....you killed indians...it was their continent !!!Living with youz peacefully ??? Its hard !!!  I wish , it would be possible , that you wake up tomorrow with a black skin  and all blacks with a white skin....just for a week....may be you could learn something......this was my longest comment.....because I am so sick and tired of those stupid , ugly comments....and we are all living on ONE planet... PEACE !!!!!

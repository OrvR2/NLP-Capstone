Is this really the same person? "Bachelor Pad" finalist Ella Nolan pulled a Heidi Montag by undergoing a whopping five surgeries in just one day. After an operation that included rhinoplasty, breast implants and liposuction -- with some three liters of fat removed from her abdomen and upper-thigh area alone -- the single mother reveals joy at her new slimmed-down body and chiseled face on the cover of Life & Style magazine. The veteran reality star -- she appeared on the Jake season of the "Bachelor" last year before returning to the tube for "Bachelor Pad" -- apparently wasn't happy about how she appeared on screen: "TV magnifies all your flaws, and seeing my profile really bothered me."

				Kind of bums me out. I write something about this story and it doesn't show up. So if I write some comment like this - that has no real meaning -- it will be posted. Oh well .... if these are the type of comments that you want .... I will have to get used to replying without really saying anything all that worthy of being read. And I will have to shorten my writing to something like yes. Yep. No. Nay not really. I will work on it . I mean no sense in typing a lot - only to not have it show up.

				Ok she had work done, but was the 'squint' look included for free? I can imagine the promo ads "Get 5 surgeries done and get a squint for FREE!" I know it's probably just her being outside in the sun, I think she looked good before and still looks pretty.

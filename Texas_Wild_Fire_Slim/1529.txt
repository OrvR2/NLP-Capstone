Border patrol agents discovered some hot and spicy contraband last Friday when they came across a tractor trailer filled with hot sauce and marijuana, reports CBS Los Angeles.
The weed, valued at $1.4 million, was discovered at the Otay Mesa cargo facility near San Diego, according to KTLA. 
Suspecting that something was amiss, custom officials ran the vehicle through the port's x-ray system and found "inconsistencies in the cargo," notes Fox News. After unloading the entire shipment, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers found 2,330 pounds of pot hidden amongst hot sauce bottles -- a little over one ton of the drug.
Smuggling marijuana with hot sauce sounds like a stoner's dream (just add a burrito and that's a pretty good Friday evening), but it doesn't even come close to some of the weirdest ways to traffic drugs across the border. The List Cafe discusses 10 "creative" ways to smuggle narcotics; real life examples include hiding cocaine under your foreskin and in the stomachs of live boa constrictors. Another listicle from Top10Kid.com features sad examples of surgically implanted drugs in puppies and people, as well as "heroin-covered cocaine." Read these cautionary tales and alternate between marveling at drug traffickers' daring and stupidity.

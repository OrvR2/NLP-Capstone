twitter like timeline with your friends


imagine twitgoo with the latest tweetgoos of your followers / twitter friends on the home page timeline,
it would be sth so cool like using twitter exactly for sharing "what you are seeing" instead of "what you are doing"

The API and RSS feeds for the various pages should enable a developer to build this pretty quickly.

Add an option on each twitgoo image to buy it as a print


When displaying the images have options to buy as prints, make it an automated system.... only or high res images.

To be able to edit photo's


This is a idea to be able to edit your photo's like on photobucket or tinypic. You can add fhotoflexer or picnik. Some way to edit or customize you photo's. A great Idea!

put the reply thing under the answers


Hey, It'd be better to have the replies right under the tweeted text under the pic like I did on this pic: http://is.gd/56bkQ
The way it's shown now isn't good because the replies are at the bottom of the site.
Thanks!

Add more return photo sizes to the API


Rather than having just thumbnail and hi-res, I'd like the option to grab a medium-sized photo (450x450)

In 2003, Hillary Clinton screeched "I am sick and tired of people who say that if you debate and you disagree with this administration somehow you're not patriotic. We should stand up and say we are Americans and we have a right to debate and disagree with any administration."

Now she is questioning congress' patriotism for asking﻿ questions about Libya. What a two faced horse.

What she says is true, if you consider her to be talking about the worldly leaders. However, we should not debate and disagree with God's administration and we as a people have failed to remember﻿ where we came from.

Right on, Hillary. She'd have been tougher than Bo. McCain would've been better than Bo too.﻿ They've both got steel Obama doesn't. Most frustrating President since Carter.

@thmoorer Do you not get it?﻿ She means you can take both sides. If you don't agree with everything the government says, you have the right to tickle on thesubject and disagree. If you agree, whatever. But disagreeing with the name does not make you an "outcast" or "unpatriotic" means you have other views.

@merkinmuffleypotus LOLz, play the "good side" all you want. I so much as criticize or question this man and I have all sorts of granola-munchers frothing at the mouth at me.
Both sides hate one another and the rhetoric is very﻿ heated. There are times when the left is unpatriotic and there are times when you disagree with liberals and they simply disagree back cordially but seriously both sides have never been more charged and polarized in recent history.

clinton is a shill, a puppet of wall street and multinational corporations. she takes her orders from the globalists in the shadows behind her, from the cfr, from officers within the bilderberg group. this must be her last governmental post she can be allowed to hold. her time is over. brzezinski said in canada last year to branch cfr members there that the people of the world are politically awake like never before in world history﻿ and are looking the elite in the eyes. you must go now babe !!

Don't you just love it when they become hypocrites? *Sigh* At least there is a candidate out there that hasn't lied and won't lie to us.

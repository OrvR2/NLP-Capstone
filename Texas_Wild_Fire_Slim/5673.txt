Son's Pregnant Girlfriend Has Dad Expecting TroubleBy Abigail Van Buren | Dear Abby – 10 hrs ago





DEAR ABBY: My son's girlfriend is pregnant. I think there is a chance it may not be his, although she claims it is. "Ben" met "Christy," and a little over a week later she announced she was pregnant. She's now 34 weeks into the pregnancy. 
I have asked him repeatedly if he is sure the baby is his and he says yes, but the math doesn't seem right to me. I have suggested Ben seek a paternity test, but I don't think he's going to take my advice.
I am not the only person who is questioning this, and I feel terrible for having the doubt. He has asked Christy to marry him and she accepted. I couldn't believe it. They were going to marry that same month, but when Ben mentioned a prenuptial agreement to protect the real estate and other property he owns (and that I'm financially involved in), Christy blew up! She just about kicked Ben to the curb. Now, thankfully, the wedding is postponed. Christy's overboard reaction has added to my suspicion. What do you think, Abby? -- SUSPICIOUS DAD IN RHODE ISLAND
DEAR DAD: I agree that before your son marries Christy, everything should be out in the open. Regardless of whose child she is carrying, your son may be in love with her and it may not matter to him. If the child is indeed his, a paternity test would lay any doubts to rest.
That said, I spoke with my gynecologist and asked how long after conception it would take for a pregnancy to show up in a test, and was told the answer is one week after a woman's period is late. For Ben not to insist on having a prenuptial agreement under these circumstances would be a mistake, and I hope he will reconsider.

DEAR ABBY: My mother died suddenly three years ago and my sister overdosed a year later. I didn't know she was so depressed.
Her son, "Jordan," is the joy of my life. Every time I watch him, all I can think of is "Why?" Why did my sister choose to leave us alone? I don't know how to move on when I look at Jordan and think of my sister. Please help. -- LEFT WITH THE MEMORIES
DEAR LEFT: Please accept my deepest sympathy for the multiple losses you have suffered. Although you feel left alone by your sister's suicide, the truth is you are not alone. In the United States, millions of people's lives have been touched by suicide -- whether it was that of a colleague, friend or a family member. That you are reminded of your sister when you see your nephew is a normal reaction.
When your sister overdosed, she may have been acting on impulse and trying to end what she perceived to be intolerable psychic pain. Please contact the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Among the many programs it offers is a listing of local support groups for survivors. The website is www.afsp.org; the phone number is (888) 333-2377.
Author Eric Marcus has written an excellent book on this subject, "Why Suicide?" published by Harper One. He, like you, is a survivor of suicide, and you may find the answers you're looking for by reading it.

L1  Yes, they should have a paternity test and yes, they should have a pre-nup drawn up if they intend to get married.  But I personally believe that from the "Christy" acted the baby does not belong to the son.
L2  Did she overdose or was it suicide?  That aside, you have to buck up and raise Jordan, look forward and be positive so that you don't pass your depressed feelings onto Jordan.

Is it the Dad's Baby?

DEAR SUSPICIOUS DAD: Well if no paternity test is done then the big moment will be when the baby arrives and it looks nothing like your son! You have every right to insist on knowing whether it is really your grandchild.

actually the night of the day i got pregnant with my second child i  knew i was pregnant.   i spent most of that night throwing up my dinner ( potato, onion and cheese saute'd) and from that day on  until she was born I couldnt stand the smell of sauting onions.   I had even told my husband that night that i was preg and he laughed at me.  I told him in 30 days he would owe me an apology.    

So while highly doubtful that the child actually is his, especially given the temper tantrum over a prenup... there is an extremely slim chance she did know

DEAR DAD: Of course, it's not his. He's only seeing her to cover up the fact that he's gay.

1. Who cares if the child is his or not? Obviously he loves her enough that it doesn't matter. THAT makes a father 

2. He wants a pre-nup. She doesn't. Yes, get arid of her..because these things can't work out ! (that's sarcasm btw)

You are an idiot , youn don't know what the hell you are talking about  , you have a  few screws loose , you need a shrink to take care of you , I was just wondering when did you get out of the funny farm ? you sound like you went to the school of drop outs , because that is where idiots come from , get your head out of your you know what and go to school and learn about life before you make an idiot out of yourself like you did here , I'm a father , and I know exactly who my kids belong to , so if you want to go on sounding like a complete brain dead idiot go ahead and keep shooting your big mouth off and show people how stupid you really are .

If his son or the skank had the morals of an alley cat, this wouldn't be an issue.  The both sound like trailer trash.

Dad should stay out of it. This creepy son will never know, if he is or not the father. Just like all the men of this earth, has no idea if their children are theirs or not. Only the the women knows the reality and the truth, who's child it is. No disrespect to the women's of this earth. For us men, we can only trust their word of our female counterparts and faith.

Well Dad, junior just messed up big time.  Now he pays hard for the next 18 years for failing to keep it in his pants until he's in a stable marriage.  If he doesn't want a paternity test then he was busy enough to think it's probably his even if she's suckering him into paying for one that isn't which seals his fate.  If he marries her without a pre nup half his stuff is toast.  If he skips marriage he's on the hook for a big chunk of his paycheck in child support for the next 18 years as long as she says he's the father and he's too stupid to get the tests to prove otherwise.  Hope he likes ramen noodles and Kraft Mac, he'll be eating on the cheap for a long time.  This is why people who mess around risking a pregnancy before being in a stable marriage are complete and utter idiots.  You get...  this...

Abby's advice is good.
The prenup protects only assets owned by the guy prior to the marriage; it does not protect assets acquired after the marriage.  If this business is as successful as the father lets on, all she has to do is behave herself for about five years.  A divorce then gets her a huge sum of money and child support.
If this pregnant woman is complaining about the prenup, she's a gold-digger who can't think ahead.  The ones to worry about are those who think 10 years ahead and cheat the whole time.

Dear, SUSPICIOUS DAD IN RHODE ISLAND,
Sometimes when you know your child is doing something stupid iit allows you the time to prepare for the inevitable, Be there to pick the kid up, dust him off, and push him back out there when it's done don't ever bring it back up, just enjoy your time with your kid and that you got through it together.

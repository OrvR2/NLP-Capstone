ORLANDO, Fla. -- In their first sit-down video since since their daughter was fond not guilty of murder in their granddaughter's death, George and Cindy Anthony discussed what they think may have led to Caylee's death.Part one of two of a pre-recorded interview with Dr. Phil McGraw for "The Dr. Phil Show" aired Tuesday afternoon in Central Florida.Cindy Anthony said she is less interested in the lies her daughter told than what caused her to lie. She said Casey Anthony suffered from grand mal seizures, and believes that medical problem, or possible post-partum schizophrenia, could have contributed to her daughter's behavior during the weeks that Caylee was missing in June and July 2008."I want to find out what's wrong with Casey. I know there's something wrong," Cindy Anthony said.Cindy Anthony said Casey Anthony suffered from several grand mal seizures, including one shortly after Caylee's birth and another after she was released from the Orange COunty Jail on bond in 2008.McGraw responded to Cindy Anthony's hypothesis by proposing that perhaps Casey Anthony is simply an "unconscionable sociopath."Cindy and George Anthony also discussed their separation over George's gambling problem, saying that Casey Anthony did not want her father to return to the family home when her parents reconciled.Cindy Anthony addressed allegations by her daughter's defense team that her husband was somehow involved in Caylee's death."I watched his heart break every single day, and I watched him as frantic as he was," Cindy Anthony said.McGraw asked the Anthonys why they were not more suspicious during the weeks that passed without seeing Caylee, before she was reported missing.Cindy Anthony said she felt her daughter was keeping Caylee from her, and George Anthony said he pressed his daughter to see Caylee, but did not want to push too hard out of concern that he would be unable to repair their already damaged relationship.When asked about whether they believe Casey Anthony had put Caylee's body in the trunk of her car, George and Cindy Anthony gave different responses."Some part of me believe she was possibly back there," George Anthony said."I don't know," Cindy Anthony said.George and Cindy Anthony picked their daughter's car up from a tow yard on July 15, 2008. They testified during the murder trial that the car smelled of human decomposition, but they waited hours before calling 911.On July 5, Casey Anthony, 25, was found not guilty of all felony charges in Caylee's death. She was released from the Orange County Jail on July 17 and is currently serving one year probation for an unrelated check fraud conviction. Her whereabouts are unknown.The "Dr. Phil Show" has said it did not pay the Anthonys directly, but instead was asked to make a donation to the Anthonys charity, which has not yet been created.

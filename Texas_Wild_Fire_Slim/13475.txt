Just a note, I tried taking supplies to an Austin Fire Department station and they wouldn’t take them.  They said that they weren’t involved in the Bastrop firefighting efforts.  They directed me to the Red Cross office, which was only accepting monetary donations.  I ended up dropping off everything at a local church.






Kristy



I updated the listing with some places that you can donate to local animals. I am working on getting some more information that I should have this evening.

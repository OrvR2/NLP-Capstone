A 22-year-old Hutto woman was pronounced dead at the scene of a three-vehicle wreck early this morning on IH-35 near Bellmead.
Katrina Bond, a hotel desk clerk, was struck from behind, sending her 2002 Mustang into a side-skid into a tractor-trailer at about 12:02 a.m.
According to Texas Department of Public Safety officials, Bond was stopped in the center lane of the IH-35 northbound near the 339 mile marker when she was rear-ended by a 23-year-old Godley man driving a 2002 Dodge Ram. Traffic was slowed because of construction in the area, authorities said.
Bond was pronounced deceased at 2:53 a.m. by Justice of the Peace David Pareya, who ordered her body be sent for autopsy at the Southwest Institute of Forensic Science in Dallas.
The 23-year-old man suffered minor injuries, but declined medical treatment, officials said.
Both were wearing their seatbelts, according to authorities.

Let's all vow to be better drivers. 

Be aware and alert! 

Put up our phones, drugs, alcohol, and stupidity. 

Katrina did not have to die on I-35, in such a terrible manner. We are asleep at the wheel; assuming things will always be "normal." 

Well, they won't be, ever. There will always be something that throws us for a loop. 

Look for that loop; plan for it, expect it, and react accordingly.

I have two daughters and I drive the way I wish people, whom are driving along the same stretch as my girls, would drive, if they knew my beautiful babies were right beside them on the road.

We can lower the death toll on the Ol Killer (I-35). Nobobody, but us. 

Rest in peace Katrina. You will be remembered and I, personally, vow to help make the roads safer, in whatever way I am able.

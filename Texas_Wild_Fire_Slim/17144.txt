Five interesting things about Mersenne primes
by John on September 9, 2011


A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of 2. These primes are indexed by the corresponding power of two, i.e. Mp = 2p – 1. It turns out p must be prime before 2p – 1 can be prime.
Here are five things I find interesting about Mersenne primes.
1. Record size primes
The largest known prime number is a Mersenne prime, M43,112,609, proved prime in 2008. And ever since M521 was proven prime in 1952, the largest known prime has always been a Mersenne prime (with one exception in 1989). See a history of prime number records.
One reason for the prevalence of Mersenne primes in the record books is that there is a special algorithm for testing whether a number of the form 2p – 1 is prime, the Lucas-Lehmer test.
2. Finiteness
There may only be a finite number of Mersenne primes. Only 47 are known so far. There are conjectures that predict there are an infinite number of Mersenne primes, but these have not been settled.
3. Connection with perfect numbers
Euclid proved that if M is a Mersenne prime, M(M+1)/2 is a perfect number. Two millennia later, Euler proved that if N is an even perfect number, N must be of the form M(M+1)/2 where M is a Mersenne prime. (More details here.)
Since we only know of 47 Mersenne primes at the moment, and we don’t know of any odd perfect numbers, there are only 47 known perfect numbers.
4. Connection with random number generation
The Mersenne twister is a popular, high-quality random number generator. The generator is so named because its period is a Mersenne prime, M19,937.
5. History
Mersenne primes are named after the French monk Marin Mersenne (1588â1648) who compiled a list of Mersenne primes. Mersenne wasn’t the first to be aware of such primes. As mentioned above, Euclid connected these primes with perfect numbers.
Marin Mersenne is one of my academic ancestors. I studied under Ralph Showalter, who studied under Tsuan Ting, and so forth back to Frans van Shooten Jr., who studied under Marin Mersenne.
What I find fascinating about this is not my particular genealogy, but that adequate records exist to construct such genealogies. The Mathematics Genealogy Project has over 150,000 records, some reaching back to the Middle Ages.

Bastrop wildfire
by John on September 7, 2011


Smoke from the wildfires in Bastrop, Texas.
[Update: See the comment by Kerri West below. I could not tell where the photo came from, but now that I know I will honor the photographer's wishes. She has offered to provide a watermarked version of her photo. I will post it here as soon as I receive it.]
At least two people have died in the fires and many have lost their homes.
I’ve taken my daughters a couple times to a father-daughter retreat at Wilderness Ridge Camp near Bastrop. That camp has been completely destroyed by the fires.

Anti-calculus proposition of ErdĹs
by John on September 6, 2011


The “anti-calculus proposition” is a little result by Paul ErdĹs that contrasts functions of a real variable and functions of a complex variable.
A standard calculus result says the derivative of a function is zero where the function takes on its maximum. The anti-calculus proposition says that for analytic functions, the derivative cannot be zero at the maximum.
To be more precise, a differentiable real-valued function on a closed interval takes on its maximum where the derivative is zero or at one of the ends. It’s possible that the maximum occurs at one of the ends of the interval and the derivative is zero there.
The anti-calculus proposition says that the analogous situation cannot occur for functions of a complex variable. Suppose a function f is analytic on a closed disk and suppose that f is not constant. Then |f| must take on its maximum somewhere on the boundary by the maximum modulus theorem. ErdĹs’ anti-calculus proposition adds that at the point on the boundary where |f| takes on its maximum, the derivative cannot be zero.

Bayes isn’t magic
by John on September 6, 2011


If a study is completely infeasible using traditional statistical methods, Bayesian methods are probably not going to rescue it. Bayesian methods can’t squeeze blood out of a turnip.
The Bayesian approach to statistics has real advantages, but sometimes these advantages are oversold. Bayesian statistics is still statistics, not magic.

Intolerant anarchists
by John on September 5, 2011


From Jaron Lanier:
Even in the places that are called anarchistic, in fact, what happens  is a new kind of order, which is often very oppressive if you don’t  happen to fit in. In San Francisco you can be attacked by mobs of  bicycling advocates who’ve occasionally been quite ruthless because they  believe in bicycles, and they think that they’re the most enlightened,  free people in the world, and yet if somebody doesn’t agree with them,  then they have trouble.
Similarly, Burning Man, which people who fit in at Burning Man must  perceive is the most open, accepting place in the world is, in fact,  extraordinarily unaccepting of people who don’t conform.

Loving your literal neighbor
by John on September 4, 2011


It’s one thing to love your neighbor in the abstract. It’s quite another to love your literal neighbor.
As G. K. Chesterton explains:
We make our friends; we make our enemies; but God makes our next-door neighbor. âŚ The duty towards humanity may often take the form of some choice which is personal or even pleasurable. That duty may be a hobby âŚ We may be made as to be particularly fond of lunatics or specially interested in leprosy âŚ But we have to love our neighbor because he is there â a much more alarming reason for a much more serious operation. He is the sample of humanity actually given us.
Quote found in From the Library of C. S. Lewis

Willie Sutton and the multivariate normal distribution
by John on September 1, 2011


When asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton famously replied “Because that’s where the money is.”
If you read about data analysis in high dimensions, you might hear someone say they’re focused on a thin shell because that’s where the probability is. For a multivariate normal distribution in high dimensions, nearly all the probability density is concentrated in a thin shell some distance away from the origin.
What does that mean? Why is it true? How thin is the shell and what is its radius?
It seems absurd to say the probability is concentrated in a shell. The multivariate normal density looks has its greatest value at the origin and quickly decays as you move out in any direction. So most of the probability must be near the origin, right? No, because mass equals density times volume. The density decays quickly as you move away from the origin, but volume increase quickly. The product of the two is greatest at some radius away from the origin. That’s the shell.
The volume of a sphere in d dimensions is proportional to rd, so volume increases very quickly if d is large. For example, if d = 100, how much of the volume of a unit sphere is between a distance of 0.99 and 1 from the origin? Since 1100 – 0.99100 = 0.634, this says 63.4% of the volume is in the outer shell of thickness 0.01.
Since volume of a sphere is proportional to rd, the volume of a shell of radius r and thickness Îr is roughly proportional to d rd-1 Îr. When you multiply that volume by the probability density exp( -r2 / 2 ) you get that the probability mass in the shell is proportional to
rd-1 exp( -r2 / 2 ) Îr.
This leads to a Ď distribution with d degrees of freedom. (Not the better known Ď2 distribution.) This distribution has mode â(d-1) and variance 1. For large d, the distribution is approximately normal. So a multivariate normal in d dimensions with d large has roughly 95% of its probability mass in a shell of radius âd with thickness 4, two standard deviations either side of âd. (I’m approximating anyway, so I approximated â(d-1) as âd to make the conclusion a little simpler.)
The graph below gives the probability density of shells as a function of radius in dimensions 10 and 100.

What most C++ programmers do
by John on August 31, 2011


“Nobody knows what most C++ programmers do.” â Bjarne Stroustrup
The quote above came up in a discussion of C++ by Scott Meyers, Andrei Alexandrescu, and Herb Sutter. They argue that C++ is used in so many diverse applications that if someone starts a sentence with “Most C++ programmers âŚ” he probably doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

Awk one-liners
by John on August 31, 2011


Peteris Krumins has written a fine little book Awk One-Liners Explained. It’s just 58 pages, and it’s an easy read.
As I commented here, I typically try master the languages I use. But for some languages, like awk and sed, it makes sense to learn just a small, powerful subset. (The larger a language is, the harder it can be to just learn part of it because the features intertwine.) Krumins’ book would be good for someone looking to learn just a little awk rather than wanting to explore every dark corner of the language.
Awk One-Liners Explained is exactly what title would lead you to expect. It has 70 awk one-liners along with a commentary on each. Some of the one-liners solve common specific problems, such as converting between Windows and Unix line endings. Most of the one-liners are solutions to general types of problems rather than code anyone is likely to run verbatim. For example, one of the one-liners is
Change “scarlet” or “ruby” or “puce” to “red.”
I doubt anybody has ever had to solve that exact problem, but it’s not hard to imagine wanting to do something similar.
Because the book is entirely about one-line programs, it doesn’t cover how to write complex programs in awk. That’s perfect for me. If something takes more than one line of awk, I probably don’t want to use awk. I use awk for quick file filtering. If a task requires writing several lines of code, I’d use Python.
You can get an idea of the style of the book by reading the author’s blog post Famous Awk One-Liners Explained, Part I: File Spacing, Numbering and Calculations.

Officials chase unconfirmed al-Qaida bomb threatBy EILEEN SULLIVAN - Associated Press,KIMBERLY DOZIER - Associated Press | AP – 3 hrs ago

WASHINGTON (AP) — Just days before the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, U.S. counterterrorism officials were chasing a credible but unconfirmed al-Qaida threat to use a car bomb on bridges or tunnels in New York City or Washington. It was the first "active plot" timed to coincide with the somber commemoration of the terror group's 9/11 attacks a decade ago that killed nearly 3,000 people.Counterterrorism officials were investigating the threat throughout the night and into Friday, as police in New York and Washington said they would increase their already stepped-up staffing levels in light of the recent intelligence.Law enforcement officials were pursuing three people who may be traveling to the U.S. or who have recently entered the country, based on the detailed information received by the U.S. intelligence community late Wednesday, officials said. The intelligence suggested that al-Qaida planned to car bomb one of the two cities that were hit 10 years ago.The nation's terror alert level has not changed, but raising it was under consideration Thursday night.The officials described the threat to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters.Security has been enhanced around the country in the weeks leading up to the 10th anniversary, a date officials have long known could be an appealing time to attack. Law enforcement officials have been particularly wary after information gleaned from Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan indicated that al-Qaida had considered attacking the U.S. on this anniversary and other important American dates. Officials have also been concerned that terrorists would see the anniversary as an opportunity to retaliate against the U.S. for killing bin Laden in a military raid in May.The FBI and Homeland Security Department issued a joint intelligence bulletin Thursday night to law enforcement around the country urging them to maintain increased security and be on the lookout for suspicious activity.The threat came in a single piece of information and was so specific — and came at such a time of already heightened alert — that it could not be ignored, officials said."There is specific, credible but unconfirmed threat information," the head of the FBI's New York division, Janice Fedarcyk, said. "As we always do before important dates like the anniversary of 9/11, we will undoubtedly get more reporting in the coming days."New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters that police there were deploying additional resources around the city but that New Yorkers should go about their business as usual, and the city's observance of the attacks will go on as planned.In Washington, law enforcement officials said they were working 12-hour days indefinitely, and Police Chief Cathy Lanier said unattended cars parked in unusual locations risked being towed.Briefed on the threat information Thursday morning, President Barack Obama directed the U.S. counterterrorism community to redouble its efforts, a White House official said.As of late Thursday, there were no plans to change Obama's travel schedule on Sunday in light of the threat, the White House said. The president is scheduled to mark the 9/11 anniversary with stops at New York's ground zero, the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pa. He also will deliver remarks Sunday night at a memorial concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington.Law enforcement officials are checking out all of the details included in the threat, Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said."No need to panic," King said. "They have not been able to confirm it yet."Intelligence officials had not seen any specific or credible threats regarding an attack around the anniversary before Wednesday.Thursday morning, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters that there was "a lot of chatter" around the anniversary of the attacks but that there was no information about a specific threat. Napolitano had been briefed on early interpretations of the threat that morning as intelligence officials were still trying to determine the validity of the information. It later became clear that the threat was specific and credible and could not be dismissed, even though it has not been confirmed.___Associated Press writers Matt Apuzzo, Lolita C. Baldor, Julie Pace and Eric Tucker in Washington and Tom Hays in New York contributed to this report.___Follow Eileen Sullivan on Twitter at http://twitter.com/esullivanap.

They'd need to check all vans with 'Urban Moving Systems' and pictures of a plane hitting the WTC and a couple of dancing Mossad agents.  These guys were most likely behind the first 9/11, now it'll be 9/11/11.

On August 6, 2011, as per sworn testimony and the document now available to all, President Bush was provided with definititive details of intelligence of chatter about using airplanes as misslies. Lacking a date but with firm suspicion it was to be carried out before the year's end. Yet no action by Bush. Why?

With all the money and techs were using it still comes down to beating the bushes with sticks . What a agency ( homeland security ) my ass . Close these dumbasses down and save the money. Just more ways to spend our cash , with little results , to make more government jobs they say we just can't do without , more B.S. . Big corps and our own government want to keep these ragheads going to keep us off step so they can keep stealing from our pockets and they get rich in the meanwhile . Boy can they spin the peoples minds into believing anything . Thats why their dumbing down America in the schools . That main raghead Bin Laden dead lets go home or do we need to make more money for the rich ??

Hummm... Officials state the terrorists might be trying to get into the U.S. and traveling.. maybe a coincidence that the border from Mexico to Arizona lost power cuz of human failure?  Hummmm

Our southern border with mexico is a far greater threat to this country than "terrorism", yet our "leader" doesnt seem to care.

If it is unconfirmed, it should not even be published.  It is just more propaganda and media terrorism.  Yes, I agree that this date is the least likely for any real terrorism.  Beware of the media.

Yeah and there was credible evidence that Iraq had nukes. I think we all know how that went.

Does chasing this terror threat involve taking more eldery and infant white, black, and mexican americans and searching their #$%$ at the airport in front of everyone?

They should be after the real terrorists - the Republican controlled congress, the Koch Brothers, Rick Perry and Grover Norquist.

Two weeks before Bin Ladin was surrounded in Tora Bora, Halliburton landed a 56 Billion dollar contract for mineral mining in Afghanistan. Two pharma conglomerates were in the midst of negotiations for poppy growth, for their opiates, now the number one drug of death in America. As the money flows to the top in both countries......

nothing to fear people. 9/11 was orchestrated by the United States government.

The harsh reality is that U.S. foreign policy is largely to blame for violent conflicts all over the globe. We've created terrorism, and yet we're still too stupid to understand.

I don't know whom I fear more the terrorists whom roam our land or the liberal politicians we elect in Washington, at times their destruction of a once great land seems inevitable. Sadly both believe their doing right thing.

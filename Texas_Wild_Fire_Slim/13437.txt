Smoke from a wildfire hangs over a field of cattle in Bastrop, Texas. Wildfires have destroyed more than 600 homes and blackened about 45 square miles in and around Bastrop. A search team will begin looking for more possible victims of the fire, which has killed two people and forced thousands to evacuate.

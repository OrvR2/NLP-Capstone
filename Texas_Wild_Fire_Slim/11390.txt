the terrorist pilot was waving the planes wings because he was trying to throw the passengers that were attacking them off of their feet.

Why is that a new video about 9/11 usually comes out around each 9/11 anniversary?

Is anybody buying this crap anymore? Seriously NWO your house of lies is crumbling, your time is coming to an end!!! For anybody that doesn't know who was actually behind the attacks I'll clue you in, the masterminds behind 9/11 was david rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, henry kissinger, Dick cheney, donald rumsfeld, George h.w bush, the rothschild family, the CFR, the federal reserve and many more, just watch these videos for free on youtube: Loose Change, Terrorstorm, An Invisible Empire: A New World Order Defined, Endgame and many others!!! It's time to pull your head out of the sand and face the truth, it was the very same people claiming they protect the us citizens that killed those people, and sent many more young men and women to their deaths for a war based on horrific lies, these people are the very definition of psychopath...

The fact a religion is being blamed for a terrorist attack is a shame.  Their are millions of Muslims living in the US and Canada, and billions worldwide living peacefully off Mohammad's teaching which are very similar to Jesus' and those of Christianity.  A religion doesn't make you a terrorist, Hitler was Christian and quoted the Bible when exterminating Jews, ones beliefs don't determine there actions the individuals do.  The way American's talk about Muslims as if they're lesser is the same way Nazi Germany talked about the Jew's and its atrocious.  No one blamed Christianity for Hitler's actions.  Give the Muslim people a break and catch the terrorists and leave them to practice peacefully, its just an example of ignorance in the USA and a reason Neo-Naziism thrives.

I find it very curious ( suspicious ) that the plane chose to hit the Pentagon when the White House was right there for the taking. The ultimate target gets passed on ... there was no plane to be seen in the wreckage, no attack on the white house, we all no what happened here. I'm not saying that terrorist were not involved in 9/11 but it certainly looks like they had a little help

Why am I saying this at such a horrible time in history. Because many Nova Scotians took Vacation time to go to NY and help and the USA President accused Canada for this. I had at the time 2 nieces from N.S. both nurses who gave time to help. Remember 11/9  USA

Released just in time for the 10th anniversary.  How coincidental.  Still trying to convince us.   But they have had 10 years to edit the tapes and twist it into something convincing.

If we all worship allah like muslims, there would be no airplanes and no automobiles because we believe in God instead of science.  If so, who's gonna buy oil from Middle East people?  We are feeding them their food and this is the thanks we get?

What happened on 9/11 doesn't make sense.  The Muslim must have thought: "God help me kill Americans.  And God, I think you are stupid because you created American people and I have to kill myself to get rid of them.  Please help me you stupid."  And he crashed into the building.

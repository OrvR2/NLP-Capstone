Obama Plan Would Bring 1.9M Jobs: Moody's
Would grow economy 2%, says expert

(Newser) -
                                    President Obama’s jobs plan  would put some 1.9 million people back to work and grow the economy 2%, says Moody’s chief economist. The plan could slice the unemployment rate by a percentage point, adds Mark Zandi, whose analysis comes as the president heads to Virginia to...

Bank of America Job Cuts May Reach 40K
Continues major overhaul in effort to slim down

(Newser) -
                                    Job cuts at Bank of America could hit a number  much higher than earlier reported —four times higher: Executives are now discussing cutbacks to the tune of 40,000 positions, the  Wall Street Journal  reports. A final decision isn’t expected until later today. The bank is aiming to...

Obama: Be 'Big and Bold' in Jobs Speech
Go back to deficit spending to boost economy: Krugman

(Newser) -
                                    "Everyone in Washington" should be crying out, "My God, what have we done?" writes Paul Krugman in the  New York Times . His reasons: The puny 2% interest rate on 10-year national bonds is proof that President Obama's deficit spending did not raise interest rates, as critics had...

US Added No New Jobs Last Month
Unemployment remains at 9.1%

(Newser) -
                                    Following a  depressing economic forecast  from the White House budget office, today's jobs report brings even more depressing news: For the first time in nearly a year, the US economy added no net jobs last month. The government lost 17,000 jobs while the private sector added just 17,...

Americans Down on Economy, Blame Bush
86% cite 'poor' economy; 51% say it's Dubya's fault

(AP) -
                                    Americans' views on the economy have dimmed this summer. But so far, the growing pessimism doesn't seem to be taking a toll on President Obama's re-election prospects. More people now believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, a new AP-GfK poll shows, and confidence in Obama'...

Don't Hold Your Breath for New Fed Stimulus
Investors might be barking up the wrong tree

(Newser) -
                                    Stocks have been  shooting up this week  on speculation that Ben Bernanke will announce another round of quantitative easing to prop up the economy in his speech Friday at Jackson Hole. But investors had better hold their horses, Neil Irwin of the  Washington Post  reports, because “the appetite within...

Next 12 Months: No Recession, but Slow Growth
Risk of recession at 26%; unemployment likely 9% at year's end

(Newser) -
                                    Despite a bombardment of bad news in recent weeks, economists don’t expect another recession over the next 12 months—but economic growth will barely be perceptible in that period, an  AP  poll of top economists finds. They expect high unemployment and weak consumer spending to dog the US into...

Second Stimulus, Additional Debt Release Coming
President to trade short-term spending for long-term cuts

(Newser) -
                                    President Obama's  promises to boost jobs and cut the deficit  are taking shape, with a new stimulus and tax cuts for companies that hire new workers to be announced in a major address right after Labor Day, reports the  Washington Post . The stimulus is said to focus on road...

S&P 500, Nasdaq also rise

(Newser) -
                                    Markets are up, at least for now: The Dow was up more than 100 points at open, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq following suit, up about 11 and 13 points, respectively,  MarketWatch  reports. An upbeat report on retail sales no doubt prodded stocks upward: July sales rose a...

S&P: Oh, We Might Downgrade US Again
Worried partisanship will block meaningful debt reform

(Newser) -
                                    Standard & Poor's yesterday not only defended its decision to downgrade America's once-vaunted AAA credit rating for the first time, it warned that a second downgrade could be on the way if the US doesn't get its act together. “Compared to some other highly rated governments,...

Standard & Poor's Made the Right Decision
S&P may be flawed, but that doesn't make it wrong on this one: Klein, Gandel

(Newser) -
                                    Standard & Poor's is taking a lot of criticism today of the how-can-these-geniuses-lecture-us variety. Kind of  like this . All of it is warranted, writes Ezra Klein at the  Washington Post . After all, the folks at S&P "didn’t just miss the bubble," he writes. "They...

Recession Worse Than Thought; GDP Growth Weak
Economy grew just 1.3% over past three months

(Newser) -
                                    We already knew the Great Recession was the worst in decades, but in fact we were even worse off than we thought, new figures show. The economy shrank 5.1% over the course of the recession, from 2007 to 2009—1 percentage point worse than the earlier estimate of 4....

59% Pessimistic About US Economy
That's the highest level in nearly 15 years

(Newser) -
                                    With  unemployment levels high  and the  US on the brink of default , is it any surprise that American pessimism has reached a 15-year high? A new  CNN  poll cited by  Politico  finds that 59% expect the economy to be in bad shape a year from now, the highest percentage since...

(Newser) -
                                    Some 30% of unemployed workers across the US—about 4.4 million people—had been jobless for more than a year as of last month, Labor Department data shows.

And the future is looking bleak, say economists

(Newser) -
                                    Layoffs have climbed to their highest level in nearly a year—1.78 million workers were handed pink slips in May, the most since August 2010—increasing ever-present fears about the US economy.

Obama Now Talking Like a Republican
Paul Krugman: It's getting harder to trust him on the economy

(Newser) -
                                    The way President Obama is talking lately, it sounds an awful lot like he's accepted the "economic fallacies" of Republicans, writes Paul Krugman in the  New York Times . He seems more concerned about cutting the deficit and slashing spending than creating jobs. It's possible this is part...

Unemployment Now 9.2% as Hiring Nears Standstill
And May numbers revised downward as well

(AP) -
                                    The June jobs report is out, and it isn't pretty. Hiring slowed to a near-standstill last month: Employers added the fewest jobs in nine months and the unemployment rate rose to 9.2%. The Labor Department says the economy generated only 18,000 net jobs in June, and the...

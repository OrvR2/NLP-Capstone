   Bronx Dentist Discusses Keys to Choosing a Dental PracticePRWeb – 1 hr 51 mins ago





   According to a recent study by the American Dental Hygienist Association (ADHA), nearly 75% of adult Americans suffer from various forms of gum disease and are unaware of the condition. Dr. Victor Oelbaum, a dentist in Bronx, NY, says that having routine dental checkups is crucial to maintaining good oral health. He also discusses key qualities to look for when selecting a dental practice.Bronx, NY (PRWEB) September 08, 2011  In a recent survey by the American Dental Hygienist Association (ADHA), almost three-quarters of American adults are suffering from various forms of gum disease. A similar study on oral health and dental care recently released by the American Dental Association (ADA) found that a person’s smile outranked eyes, hair, and body as the most important physical feature. Dr. Victor Oelbaum, a cosmetic and implant dentist in Bronx, NY, says that given the importance of having a clean and attractive mouth, selecting the right dental practice has only become more crucial to a person’s health and overall quality of life. He adds that selecting the right dental practice can help patients not only reduce gum disease through pain-free gum treatment using LANAP technology, but it can also give them a beautiful and confident smile.
Dr. Oelbaum says he suggests researching and exploring different aspects of dental care to find a practice that can provide patients the most comprehensive and personalized treatment. He also recommends looking for a practice with a thorough focus on preventative dentistry. With a tooth decay prevalence of 92% in adults 20 to 64, according to a study by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), Dr. Oelbaum also says that regular dental checkups are important for preventing poor oral health. He adds that a qualified and caring staff who listens to patient feedback can contribute to the overall results of proper dental dare.
Whether they are looking to visit the office for a cosmetic procedure, gum recontouring or standard cleaning, Dr. Oelbaum says he tells prospective patients to sit in his waiting room and interview other patients at his office, asking questions about his staff and the level of treatment they provide. He adds that patient referrals and opinions are a helpful way to receive practice information from a trusted and familiar source.
Dr. Oelbaum says that, at his practice, a passion for providing quality and personal patient care is the most important thing for a dentist to have. “Ultimately, the patient takes the plunge and makes the appointment, starting out on that unique voyage to have a great dental experience. When they come here, they realize that the bond to our patients is a lot more than just dental.”

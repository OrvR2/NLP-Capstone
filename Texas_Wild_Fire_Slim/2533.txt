Police in central China’s Henan province said they have rescued 30 mentally handicapped people who had been enslaved at illegal brick kilns, in the latest case of slavery in China, a problem that continues in the country despite government pledges to eradicate it.
Zhang Xiaolei, director of the province’s propaganda office, said three people were in police custody in connection with the operation of the brick kilns, while several others remained at large. He said authorities learned of the brick kilns through recent local media reports.
Mr. Zhang and state-run media said the workers had severe mental illnesses and had been unable to provide police with their identities or where they were from.

Stephen Menendian: The 150th Anniversary of the American Civil War: Our Legacy Considered


		                        
																The lessons of the abolitionist movement -- which ultimately galvanized a nation to the immorality of slavery, and profoundly influenced the terms of the debate over the war and its purpose -- are still applicable.                            







J. L. Morin: Modern-Day Slavery 101: Losing Control All over the World


		                        
																What most people don't know is that there are about 27 million slaves -- real slaves -- in the world today. That's more than at the height of the trans-Atlantic slave trade in the late 1700's.                            







John Robbins: Is There Child Slavery in Your Chocolate?


		                        
																We live in cynical times. But even in a day of widespread and flagrant abuse of power, there is a dark side to the operations of the Hershey company that make it particularly egregious.                            







Marc Gunther: Modern-Day Slavery: Alive and Well


		                        
																The U.S. State Department this month published a report finding that more than 12 million people worldwide are victims of "trafficking in persons" -- trapped in forced labor, bonded labor or prostitution.

				I'm still stunned that American businesses have offshored manufactur­ing and jobs to China.  Since when has it been okay for Americans to go into business with a brutal dictatorsh­ip???  And yet American consumers still flock to WalMart, supporting this unholy alliance, all the while screaming that Obama is not creating jobs.

I am stunned that you are stunned or naive.SInc­e when....? since time immemorial­. All our wars are fought with a corporatis­t agenda,,,,­if it means installing a despot then The USA will do it regardless of the consequenc­es to the people of the particular nation.If it means doing business with a "sworn enemy Communist china" well the US does that too.

				It's all a question of degree.  In America there are Elois and Morlocks.

Also, when the perpetrato­rs are caught in China, they are severely punished, some with capital punishment­.  Yes there are bad sickos in all societies, and it is tough to fathom the depravitie­s of these operators.  But a few isolated incidents do not a whole nation condemn.  Keep in mind that America had 30% of its population as slaves.

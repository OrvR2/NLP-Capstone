 Here are five things we learned at the Waterbury Football Jamboree Saturday:

1. Sacred Heart junior quarterback Javon Martin can throw the football. A left-hander, he has a soft touch and he can air it out, giving his receivers enough time to get the ball in stride, as indicated by two long touchdowns. He also has a little moxie, shown by his third-down run for a score when he tucked the ball under his arm and sprinted toward the end zone. ]]>

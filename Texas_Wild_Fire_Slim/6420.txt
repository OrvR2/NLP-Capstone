NIAMEY, Niger — A large convoy of Libyan soldiers loyal to ousted leader Moammar Gadhafi crossed the desert border into Niger and rolled into the frontier town of Agadez late Monday, a resident who is the owner of a local newspaper said.
The convoy consisted of more than a dozen pickup trucks bristling with well-armed Libyan troops, said Abdoulaye Harouna, the owner of the Agadez Info newspaper, who saw them arrive.
At the head of the convoy, he said, was Tuareg rebel leader Rissa ag Boula, a native of Niger who led a failed war of independence on behalf of ethnic Tuareg nomads a decade ago. He then sought refuge in Libya and was believed to be fighting on behalf of Gadhafi.
It was not immediately clear if the convoy included any members of the Gadhafi family or other high-level members of his regime.
The toppled Libyan leader is known to have used battalions of Tuareg fighters who have long-standing ties to Gadhafi. His regime is believed to have financed the Tuareg rebellion in the north of Niger. African nations where Tuaregs represent a significant slice of the population, like Niger, have been among the last to recognize the rebels that ousted Gadhafi.
Gadhafi remains especially popular in towns like Agadez, where a majority of the population is Tuareg and where the ex-ruler is remembered for his largesse and for his assistance to the Tuareg minority during their fight for autonomy. The Sahara Desert market town is the largest city in northern Niger.
Harouna says the pro-Gadhafi soldiers accompanying Boula were coming from the direction of Arlit. The desert that stretches north of Arlit borders both Libya and Algeria. Some members of Gadhafi's family, including his wife, his daughter and two of his sons, recently sought refuge in Algeria.
Moammar Gadhafi, who ruled Libya for more than 40 years, has been on the run since losing control of his capital, Tripoli, last month, though the rebels say at least two of his sons had been in the town of Bani Walid, one of the last remaining pro-Gadhafi strongholds, in recent days. Moussa Ibrahim, Gadhafi's spokesman and one of his key aides, was still believed to be in the town, rebel officials said.
Thousands of rebel fighters have surrounded Bani Walid, but have held back on a final assault in hopes of avoiding a bloody battle for the desert town some 90 miles (140 kilometers) southeast of Tripoli. The rebels say a small but heavily armed force of pro-Gadhafi fighters – at least some of them high-ranking members of his ousted regime – have taken up defensive positions in the town.
Most of Libya has welcomed the uprising that swept Gadhafi from power, though rebel forces – backed by NATO airstrikes – have yet to capture loyalist bastions like Bani Walid, Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte and the isolated southern town of Sabha.
The rebels have extended to Saturday a deadline for the surrender of Sirte and other loyalist areas, though some rebel officials have said they could attack Bani Walid sooner because it has so many prominent loyalists.

				No they are not. Many of them are Islamic terrorists who the CIA and the British intelligen­ce agency used to oust Gaddafi. The American people need stop being gullible. This is not a TV, movie Hollywood story. All the talk about freedom and democracy is all a fairy tale. We barely have it in our own country. What good is freedom and democracy when people are starving. The Libyan people were stable living normal lives under Gaddafi. They were living better than many Americans. Do you really thing their will be true democracy under an Islamic state?

				There appears to be a serious fault in the NATO support effort for the Rebels.  Now that Syria is under sanctions, the same as applied to Libya,  it is important that NATO not use Libya as a template, in order to resolve serious issues in other Mid East countries.  The success in Libya, although too early to call, can have the effect that the next uprising will be much easier to control by the leaders of the Western Alliance.

President Medvedev of Russia has suggested that there needs to be more collaborat­ion without threats or action, between the rulers and the rebels, of the nations concerned.  This attitude from Medvedev has many appealing facets, which are lacking in the NATO effort.  The obvious one is cost, which the US seems to want to avoid, and the remaining NATO members which lack resources.  NATO might be wise to learn this lesson rather than be aggressive­, and repeat the Libyan experience­.  The excitement of winning, can be contagious as we know, and NATO, will cease to look as a supporting alliance, but more so of an aggressor.

				The current set up of the NATO forces in Libya has little to no chance of success in Syria. At the same time it is highly unlikely that Bashar Al Assad will give up even an inch of control over to the protestors (not yet rebels) or concede to any of their demands. And after all this bloodshed, specially with videos of Syrian troops invading mosques, there is little chance that the protestors will be in the mood to to make any serious compromise­s on their legitimate demands. The only country that seems to have any leverage in there is Turkey. Will be interestin­g to see their 'developin­g' position on this whole issue.

				I like what you stated about Turkey, even though that nation is willing to not appease Israel.  Turkey is often not viewed as a dominant force in that region, but as of late, at least the West does owe Turkey for many advantages that NATO acquired for the Iraq and Afghanista­n conflicts.

				"President Medvedev of Russia has suggested that there needs to be more collaborat­­ion without threats or action, between the rulers and the rebels, of the nations concerned.­"  Whistlejac­kett

If collaborat­ion is code for simply talking at high level diplomatic meetings then Medvedev's suggestion is going nowhere.  Assadistic is a thug and won't give up power.  Evidence of that is his refusal to listen to reason thus far.  The thuggery continues and, IMO, will continue until someone starts shooting back.

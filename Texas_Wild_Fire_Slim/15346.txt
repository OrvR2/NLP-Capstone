Breaking! Obama Responds to Bob Turner Winning NY-9









NY-09 last saw Republicans hold it in 1922. The seat, last held by Anthony Weiner, flipped back to the GOP tonight in a stunning rebuke to Barack Obama.

Ari Fleischer said jokingly on Twitter, "Obama calls for NY-9 to return to it's pre-1967 status. Last time an R held the seat was 1922." No doubt Obama will soon travel to Israel.

Video: Bystanders become heroes in motorcyclist's rescue !!!







SALT LAKE CITY, Utah — The students knew they had to act quickly when they disregarded the dangers of approaching a smoking car and rushed to help lift it so a man — trapped beneath with a motorcycle just feet away in flames — could be freed.

Abbass Sharif, 28, remembers only that something needed to be done as he, a fellow Utah State University doctoral candidate and more than half dozen others lined up on one side of the 4,000-pound car. They were able to lift it within moments, allowing one of the rescuers to pull Brandon Wright to safety.

"The chance of him dying if we don't do it is like 100 percent," Sharif said, recalling the sequence of events that played out Monday in Logan, a college town roughly 90 miles north of Salt Lake City. "If you weigh the chance of you being in danger, that's going to be low, like 20 percent, compared to 100 percent."

After the heroic act, Assistant Logan Police Chief Jeff Curtis said one could "only speculate what the outcome would have been" had none of the rescuers sprung to action.

For their bravery, the rescuers are being called "heroes" and "angels," though none want the labels.

Michelle Obama blatant disrespect of flag at 911 ceremony ??? What's she saying ???










During the 9/11 ceremonies in New York the director of the C-SPAN telecast took a shot of Obama and his wife while the World Trade Center American flag that survived the attack was being folded by local police and fire fighters. Watch the video until the folding of the flag is almost finished. At that point read Michelle’s big lips as she leans over to Obama and says “ALL THIS FOR A DAMN FLAG” ???

Sarah Palin Totally Gets It !!! A must read !!!







From the Daily Telegraph:
The problem for Rick is that his stout words are in severe danger of being eclipsed by an even finer speech by Sarah Palin at Indianola, Iowa. (Thanks to Richard North for drawing it to my attention). It was so inspirational, so true that it prompted even her traditional enemy the New York Times to ask:
Is there a hint of a political breakthrough hiding in there?

I think there is. I think if she goes on like this, all bets for Perry, Bachmann, Paul are off. I think President Palin might just be the only game in town….
It’s those last remarks, I think, which could prove the game changer. In the past Palin’s opponents have found it all too easy to pigeonhole her as a right-wing fringe candidate, far too loopy to connect with mainstream America. But here she has found a universal narrative, of potential appeal to voters on both sides of the political divide. Whether we’re on the left or the right it really makes no difference: we’re ALL being shafted by a system over which we have little if any democratic control.Read More: http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100104496/sarah-palin-totally-gets-it/

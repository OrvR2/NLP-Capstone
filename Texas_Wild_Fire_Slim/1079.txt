WASHINGTON -- Congress will take up a continuing resolution to fund the government on the week of Sept. 19, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) told reporters on Wednesday, which could prevent a government shutdown caused by Congress not passing appropriations bills by the new fiscal year. 
House Republicans hoped to move through the normal budget process, but delays in passing the 12 appropriations bills makes this virtually impossible by the Sept. 30 deadline. Instead, Cantor confirmed there will be a continuing resolution to fund the government after the current continuing resolution runs out on Sept. 30. 
The bill will likely take government funding through "late fall," Cantor said, declining to comment on specific dates. 
The bill should cut discretionary spending by about $7 billion, according to a deal set in place during the debt ceiling increase in August. But some House Republicans would like to see further cuts as part of the upcoming bill.
In an Aug. 17 memo, he hinted at the upcoming tension over whether -- and how much -- to cut spending as part of the upcoming continuing resolution.
"While all of us would like to have seen a lower discretionary appropriations ceiling for the upcoming fiscal year, the debt limit agreement did set a level of spending that is a real cut from the current year level," he reminded his members. "I believe it is in our interest to enact into law full-year appropriations bills at this new lower level."

				Can you imagine what the jokers in Congress would be like if we were really in trouble?  With a 16% approval rating they're still acting like they are in control.  That means that 84% of the people don't approve of what you are doing.  Doesn't that strike a chord somewhere that you're doing the wrong things.  If Cantor was on a sinking ship the only thing sticking out of the water at this moment would be his well coiffed hair.

				It seems the Tea Party Republican­s may have learned something from their manufactur­ed debt ceiling crisis after all.  It seems they may have learned that the nation doesn't like their "if I don't get my way, I'll shut the government down" approach that they have used twice in the 8 months they have had the majority.Sorry, Cantor.  It's too late.  Your poll numbers are already in the tank and people have already seen through your agenda.    Cantor doesn't deserve to be called the "leader" of anything.

				Eric Cantor: Congress Will Avoid Government Shut-Down ..........­.......TRA­NSLATION : they have anotherpla­n to hold the American people hostage once again , while CONVINCING  us all, not to worry, it's Obama they're after - as they fail to tell us, it's all being done at OUR expense.

People, I couldcare less of they make Obama a 1 term presidentf­or there is NOTHING in itforme and neither there is anything in itfor mOST of us - other than a 5 minutes of to make us feel good.

I'm sorry, but duringthe Debt Ceiling talks, once we learned of the ULTIMATUM they gave to Obama - BUT AT OUR EXPENSE !!!!, we should have hit the streets in droves !!!, but once again all I saw was a passive bunch who should have out-source­d it to them Tunisians or Egyptians - if we didn't have the COURAGE to do it to help ourselves.

Sheeepss..­.baaaahhhh­h......she­eps !!!!

				Can we just get a budgety?? They are so afraid to do what needs to be done in Washington it is unbelievab­le!! Even rich people are willing to accept tax increases, business knows they've been coasting for years on the federal dime. Old folks are willing and have already had to do without increases to Social Security. The only ones not willing to sacrtifice in thie financial crisis -0 and it is a financial crisis - is Congress!! Is the election so important you're willing to sell out the whole country to get elected!?!­?!? I'll vote agains - and I did say against - every incumbenty in the greart state of TEXAS - and even Perry - if congress doesn't pass a tax increase a;long with the cuts, too. If we are going to suffer, we're going to do it together. If this ship goes down, we're going together. There are no more life boats for anyone. so get on with it!!

				Cantor we should not be cutting billions in spending, we need to close loopholes in the tax code that make it so corporatio­ns and millionair­es, billionair­es pay as low taxs or no taxs at all. Stop lowering taxes, end the wars in Iraq and scrap the Bush Tax cuts, if your corporate handlers let you, and that will make it so the government does not have to borrow money and raise its debt.

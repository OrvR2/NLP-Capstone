More »Debate presents crucial GOP testThe incredible shrinking ObamaPolitico - Wed, Sep 7, 2011The once-muscular presidency of Barack Obama has undergone a dramatic downsizing – in power, popularity, prestige and ambition – to the point where even Obama die-hards are starting to question his ability to right the economy or win reelection. More »The incredible shrinking ObamaPerry book a treasure trove for foesPolitico - Fri, Sep 2, 2011Rick Perry describes Social Security as a “violent” attack on core American values. He says Sarah Palin may have been right that the Affordable Care Act created death panels. He says it was “unprincipled” to establish the Department of Homeland Security. More »Perry book a treasure trove for foesRomney camp not panicking — yetPolitico - Wed, Aug 31, 2011Rick Perry’s surge in the polls is prompting some high-profile Mitt Romney backers to urge the former Massachusetts governor to step up his efforts before it’s too late. More »Romney camp not panicking — yetBlack leaders turn up heat on ObamaPolitico - Tue, Aug 30, 2011If there’s anything close to a political certainty in 2012, it’s that Barack Obama will get more than 90 percent of the African-American vote. More »Black leaders turn up heat on ObamaArt sends rare W.H. message on racePolitico - Wed, Aug 24, 2011President Barack Obama has taken a decidedly low-key approach to racial issues since he became America’s first black president two years ago. But in a hallway outside the Oval Office, he has placed a head-turning painting depicting one of the ugliest racial episodes in U.S. history. More »Art sends rare W.H. message on raceSilicon Valley boom a bust for ObamaPolitico - Fri, Aug 19, 2011SAN FRANCISCO — Silicon Valley is like an alternative-universe version of America — a place where businesses are making billion-dollar acquisitions, jobs are being added by the thousands, and the buzz is not over plant closings but Apple’s plans for a giant hew headquarters that looks like a spaceship. More »Silicon Valley boom a bust for ObamaVeepstakes speculation heats upPolitico - Thu, Aug 18, 2011The 2012 GOP presidential field isn’t even settled yet but already speculation about the eventual nominee’s running mate is beginning to pick up. More »Veepstakes speculation heats upObama's vision problemPolitico - Mon, Aug 15, 2011Of all the presidents to occupy the Oval Office in recent years, Barack Obama would seem the least likely to be wrestling with what President George H.W. Bush so unforgettably called “the vision thing.” More »Obama's vision problemIowa: Big turnout good for Bachmann, small good for TPawPolitico - Sat, Aug 13, 2011DES MOINES – The winner of Saturday’s Iowa GOP straw poll won’t be known until sometime after 6 p.m. But you’ll be able to hazard a good guess hours earlier simply by eye-balling the crowd gathered in and around the Hilton Coliseum at Iowa State University. More »Iowa: Big turnout good for Bachmann, small good for TPawAll eyes turn to AmesPolitico - Mon, Aug 8, 2011The most important week of the 2012 presidential race so far begins now. More »All eyes turn to AmesIf Perry gets in, will Rove be out?Politico - Fri, Aug 5, 2011If Texas Gov. Rick Perry ultimately decides to run for president, it would shake up the Republican race, directly threatening Michele Bachmann, Tim Pawlenty and the other candidates vying to be the leading alternative to frontrunner Mitt Romney. More »If Perry gets in, will Rove be out?Obama's big dragsPolitico - Thu, Aug 4, 2011The politics of the debt fight were a drag for President Barack Obama, yanking his popularity to new lows. Here’s an even bigger drag: Obama emerges from the months-long fracas weaker — and facing much deeper and more durable political obstacles — than his own advisers ever imagined. More »Obama's big dragsSome govs succeed with softer touchPolitico - Wed, Aug 3, 2011To judge from the headlines, the 2010 class of GOP governors - as in Wisconsin’s Scott Walker, Ohio’s John Kasich and Florida’s Rick Scott - ushered in an era of radical changes achieved through confrontational politics that have also resulted in startlingly low poll ratings and civil wars with their state legislatures. More »Some govs succeed with softer touchBiden, McConnell and the making of a dealPolitico - Tue, Aug 2, 2011He had given away his demand for a clean increase in the debt limit. He had given up on tax hikes on the rich and closing corporate loopholes. He had even given away billions in cuts to domestic programs close to his heart. More »Biden, McConnell and the making of a dealDebt deal complicates liberals' supportPolitico - Mon, Aug 1, 2011President Barack Obama's road to debt ceiling compromise runs right through the left wing of the Democratic Party. More »Debt deal complicates liberals' supportPat Boone climbs political chartsPolitico - Mon, Aug 1, 2011The last time Pat Boone shot to the top of the Billboard charts — with syrupy swooners like “Love Letters in the Sand” — Dwight Eisenhower was in the White House. More »Pat Boone climbs political chartsBoehner to tie balanced budget amendment to votePolitico - Fri, Jul 29, 2011House Republican leaders plan to tie a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to their two-step debt-ceiling bill — a move that could help turn momentum back toward Speaker John Boehner's plan. More »Boehner to tie balanced budget amendment to voteAs clock ticks, default or deal?Politico - Fri, Jul 29, 2011Washington awoke Friday morning to a possibility that has been widely shrugged off for weeks, but suddenly seems chillingly real: Could the government actually default? More »As clock ticks, default or deal?Politicians cash in on the debt debatePolitico - Thu, Jul 28, 2011Democrats and Republicans may not be able to get together on a deal to raise the debt ceiling, but there’s one thing lawmakers in both parties seem able to agree on: They need cash. More »Politicians cash in on the debt debateIt's not the default, it's the downgradePolitico - Wed, Jul 27, 2011It’s not the default that strikes the most fear in the White House and Congress these days. It’s the downgrade. More »It's not the default, it's the downgradeObama reasserts himself; Boehner pushes backPolitico - Mon, Jul 25, 2011President Barack Obama elbowed his way back into the debt ceiling debate Monday night, three days after Republicans shoved him out, but he offered no hint of a solution to the escalating political and financial crisis. More »Obama reasserts himself; Boehner pushes backObama's sidelines gamblePolitico - Mon, Jul 25, 2011Congress is eating its peas without Barack Obama. More »Obama's sidelines gamblePhone tag and wrong numbers: The collapse of the debt talksPolitico - Sat, Jul 23, 2011As he had done often during their weeks of budget talks, President Barack Obama tried to get House Speaker John Boehner on the phone late Thursday, but never heard back.

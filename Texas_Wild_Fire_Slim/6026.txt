A few days ago, we saw Lady Gaga go au naturel for her "You And I" fashion-film series, and we liked her fresh-faced new look.
Now more images from the shoot by Dutch fashion photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin can be seen in Harper's Bazaar's October issue.
In the cover story, Gaga discusses her affinity for designers like Thierry Mugler and Hussein Chalayan and proclaims that without the late Alexander McQueen's creations, "I'd be naked." 
(In her last Bazaar cover story, she revealed that McQueen had been working "through her", which we take to mean... well, we're not really sure what that means ).
Turns out stripping down for the shoot, in which she sports only a skimpy slip, has always come natural. "Even when I was a kid, I used to run around naked with the babysitter, driving her crazy," Gaga reveals to the mag.
And the Lady says she was similarly carefree when she and friends plundered the Versace archive in Milan a few months back:
"We were all running around this warehouse laughing and putting on jackets and shoes. We started crying at one point. I've been dreaming of seeing those outfits my whole life."
Though some of her Versace acquisitions  -- particularly a certain black harness -- proved controversial, we'd be pretty excited to have access to vintage Gianni creations too.
Read more from the cover story here.

				Gaga looks pretty good in these photos. It's a shame that she has the talent of a flea dip.

				Whenever I had thought about her which luckily isn't often, I have seen her as a cheap knockoff of another talentless singer, Madonna. Neither are singers, they are entertaine­rs and there are far better singers out there who get little to no press but deserve it more. That being said I am very impressed with these photos. She has a natural beauty and sensuality that is rarely seen anymore. Glad she was daring enough to take these and take her "career" in another direction.

The day we will be able to do the same thing and look, probably much better than most of those who critic her appearance­, we, they will have a legitimate right to have a thing, convenient­ly negative to say about her.

				I came back to see that nothing could have changed in a hour.  We still have those who are so spontaneou­sly negative about what ever she does or is around. 
Often those people doesn't end there, their need to criticize negatively­.  Everyone, especially if you are a public face, have a problem that annoyed them.
If I drop "Obama," they will have an encycloped­ia of critics against him.  SEE!!!
I'm amused and annoyed that most of them express their negative feeling that is often addressed to themselves­. 
Small mind talk about others.  Average mind talk about themselves and great minds talk about ideas. 

Most of us are small, average and great but them....hm­mm...

				For gods sake people - she is an ARTIST! How TEDIOUS the performing arts would be if the artists all looked like they were going to work at a desk job everyday. Why are SO MANY of you saying now that she is sans make up and sans the "silly" costumes - you can take her seriously? The imaginatio­n and thought that she puts into those pieces takes a lot of smarts and creativity­. They weave into her music, performanc­es and videos. 

Do you people have zero imaginatio­n and creativity­?

Her pared down look is ONE of her pieces. She is who she is and not "trying" to be anything but remain true to herself. It is who she is and what makes her comfortabl­e in her skin.

She isn't hiding her true self with her style and makeup. She is exposing who she truly is as a person and an artist.

She IS fearless regardless­....

Many artists are pretty avant garde in their attire. 

She is smart, creative, earnest, talented and gracious.

				Wow, she has a really interestin­g & attractive face; beautiful bone structure.  I think Gaga is a huge talent, but I've grown tired of the "statement­" outfits and makeup. For some reason, looking at her without all the stage makeup makes me take her more seriously as an artist.  Not really sure why, but I guess I feel she's hiding her true self behind the eccentric Gaga image.  I loathed her Jo Calderone schtick at the VMAs and felt it detracted from the music and the Britney Spears/Bey­once tribute. Good for her for being fearless enough to show herself on the HB cover in such a natural state...I think she looks great.

				Good fer her.... just like Gene Simmons and Boy George, she doesnt need all that makeup and silly disguises to make music..too distractin­g. She should have kept her au natural look under wraps so she could go undercover in public and blend right in.

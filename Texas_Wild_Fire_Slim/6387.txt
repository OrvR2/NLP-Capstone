This has been a major year for Jennifer Lopez. 
She just signed on for another season of "American Idol," after her winning turn as a judge on season 10. She teamed with Pitbull and scored a hit club anthem with "On the Floor." And the pop diva showed her sense of humor in a series of spots promoting her new collection for Kohl's.
Jenny from the Block has also made some seriously stylish red carpet choices lately, including a sizzling Gucci halter gown and floral shrug she wore to the Met Costume Institute Gala, and an embellished, peekaboo Pucci number she donned for the BAFTAs.
Turns out Neiman Marcus was a fan of these looks too -- the retail giant put Drew Barrymore in both dresses for its fall campaign ads. Drew is only the chain's second celebrity spokesperson since Jennifer Jason Leigh in 1994, so presumably they wanted the ads to make a splash.
We have to admit, we're pretty smitten with the feather-adorned Gucci frock (as is Karlie Kloss, who modeled the gown for the September cover of Harper's Bazaar Australia). But the green Pucci isn't too shabby either. Which do you prefer?

				I am not a big JLo fan, I think that she I pretty, and that is about it.  I am however a Drew Barrymore fan, and JLo's look are real red carpet looks and Barrymore'­s are model photograph­y.  They are amazing and they rock.  But it is kinda  of an unfair comparison­.  I would love to see how Drew would do thee on the red carpet.

Conrad Black goes back to jailBy Barbara Liston | Reuters – Wed, Sep 7, 2011

MIAMI (Reuters) - Former media mogul Conrad Black returned to prison on Tuesday in Florida to finish serving a sentence for fraud and obstruction of justice, a U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman said.
Black, who turned 67 in August, was booked in to the Federal Correctional Institution in Miami, a low-security facility, shortly after 1 p.m. EDT, bureau spokesman Chris Burke told Reuters from Washington.
A U.S. judge in June re-sentenced Black, a Canadian-born British citizen and member of Britain's House of Lords, to another 13 months in prison on top of the 29 months he had already served for his 2007 conviction.
He had been expected to serve out his time at the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex near Orlando, Florida, where he was held previously. It was not immediately clear why he was instead assigned to the Miami facility, where former Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega was imprisoned for drug smuggling and money laundering.
A federal jury had found Black guilty of scheming with partner David Radler and other executives to siphon off millions of dollars in proceeds from the sales of newspapers as they unwound Hollinger International, once the world's third-largest publisher of English-language newspapers.
It operated the Chicago Sun-Times, the Jerusalem Post, London's Daily Telegraph and dozens of other newspapers across North America.
Black was released from prison a year ago while his case was under appeal, which resulted in two of his three fraud convictions being vacated and a shortening of his original 78-month sentence.
Black will face deportation from the United States after his release. That could come earlier than the remaining 13 months in his sentence based on time off for good behavior.

Black is going back to jail. Why has no one of the executives who brought about the financial disaster in America been sent to Jail?. Who got paid off?.

According to Black, he's learned from his experience! Sure: how to steal; how to cheat and defraud more effectively; how to make useful alliances with powerful allies- such as his bunk buddies in the Mafia; how to profit financially and egotistically by spewing his select lies and denials all neatly bound in a book rather than in his own newspapers and magazines.Yup, he's humble now. No longer that arrogant, self-serving, remorseless convicted felon that he once was? Yup. But one thing for sure, and by his own choice, he no longer is- a Canadian. YAAAAAYYYYYY!!!!!!!!

Like George Carlin said, we need to start executing some bankers for their crimes.  That will clean things up right quick.

lose lose lose...Black back in jail; judge Amy never got her promotion to the US supreme court and the prosecutor didn't become Illinois attorney general. all for taking a potted plant and family photo out of a Toronto office not even in US jurisdiction. while Bush/Cheney &Rumsfeld are still on the loose.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS:
(CNN) During a ceremony at the Governor’s Palace in Monterrey recognizing Juan Carlos Rocha for his heroic actions in the deadly Mexico casino fire in August, Nuevo Leon Gov. Rodrigo Medina offered Rocha a job as a Monterrey firefighter.
Rocha was working as a valet parking attendant outside a casino in Monterrey when the fire broke out. The fire killed 52 people, the deadliest single attack on civilians yet in Mexico’s 5-year-old drug wars.
Rocha is credited for saving dozens of lives from the smoke and flames, and was honored recently at the Governor’s Palace in Monterrey.
Rocha’s longtime dream was becoming a firefighter and he accepted the offer immediately.

A violent Labor Day weekend in New York City, in which a total of 48 67 people were shot, [UPDATE: The NYPD now confirms 67 people were shot in violence this weekend] culminated with a bloody shootout in Brooklyn Monday night that left two cops injured and three two people dead [see update below].
The incident started when Leroy Webster, 32 and Eusi Johnson, 29 got into a fistfight in an apartment building at the corner of Franklin Avenue and Park Place in Crown Heights around 9PM. The fight then spilled onto the street where Webster shot Johnson in the neck and killed him. 
Police, of whom there were 600 in the neighborhood that day for the West Indian Day parade, responded and shot at Webster, who returned fire. 
In the ensuing shootout, 90 rounds were discharged, a police source told The Huffington Post. Webster was shot several times and died from his wounds. [UPDATE: Police initially said Wesbster had died but Commissioner Ray Kelly confirms that he is alive and in serious condition at Kings County Hospital]
According to The New York Post, a bullet grazed the left arm of Police Officer Avichaim Dicken, who was taken to Methodist Hospital. Officer Omar Medina, 36, was hit in the left arm and chest. Both officers are in stable condition. 
56 year-old Denise Gay, who was sitting on a stoop talking to her daughter, was hit with a stray bullet in the head. She was pronounced dead at the scene.
Violence marred the otherwise jubilant and colorful parade Monday, which was also the scene of fatal shootings in 2003 and 2005. 
NBC New York reports that four people were shot and wounded along the parade route Monday and a 15-year-old boy was grazed by a bullet nearby.
A police source told HuffPo Monday night that people often use the parade as an opportunity to "settle scores".
City Councilwoman Letitia James, who went to the crime scene Monday night, said she and other city officials, along with community groups, are planning a press conference this week to address one of the bloodiest weekends in recent memory.
"This is our problem," she said. 
On Sunday, Mayor Bloomberg, responding to news that 24 people had been shot within a 24 hour time span, said, "We cannot tolerate it. There are just too many guns on the streets and we have to do something about it."
That initial rash of violence began at 6AM Saturday morning when a 35-year-old woman was shot and wounded at Saratoga Ave. and Newport St. in Brooklyn. 
According to The New York Daily News, during one 18-minute stretch between 2:12 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. Sunday, five men were shot in three separate incidents, including three wounded at a house on Beach Channel Drive in Rockaway Park, Queens.
Also on Sunday morning, at 6AM, police say Dasilva Oneil, 17, opened fire and wounded 8 people at a party in the Bronx. 
Later that night, A 24-year-old man was shot in the head in front of the Unity Plaza Houses on Blake Ave. in Brownsville, Brooklyn, about 10PM Sunday, cops told The News. Donavan Dallison, of Crown Heights, died at the scene. 
By the end of the three-day weekend, The Wall Street Journal reports, 10 people 13 people were killed in the violence. [UPDATE: The NYPD now confirms 13 people died in this weekend's violence]
New York has the toughest gun laws in the country but Bloomberg said the city can't do it alone. 
At a Tuesday morning press conference Bloomberg blamed Washington, saying "This is a national problem requiring national leadership," Bloomberg said, "but at the moment neither end of Pennsylvania Avenue has had the courage to take basic steps that would save lives." 
Police sources told The New York Post they hadn't seen violence like this since New York City's crime heyday in the 1980s.
Overall, gun violence in the city is down 5.9% from last year. As of Aug. 28, 1,123 people had been shot in New York this year, according to the NYPD.

				Shame on you, Huffington Post!  Why do you report on this, but not all the shootings at the Italian Pride Parade?  Or the Polish Pride Parade in Chicago?  Or all the shootings at all the Gay Pride Parades all across the country?

I never thought you'd stoop this low.

				Mayor Bloomberg seems to forget that its not guns that kill people its people that kill people.  Perhaps if he allowed the law-abidin­g citizens to have guns than there would be less gun violence -- the only thing gun laws prohibit is law-abidin­g citizens from having them, thugs and criminals will always have them, regardless of any law that Bloomberg tries to enact.

				How typical of the LEFT. Of all the rounds fired that day ( by police and criminals ) One has to ask. Just how many of the officers rounds hit inocent bystander'­s? Just how many people die from car wrecks in that region? How many suicide's are there? Notice how they do not dwell on those other subjects, but have NO PROBLEM when it comes to gun violence. That is because, that is there agenda. Force enough gun regulation­s down your throat till you gag, and only the criminal will have his guns. ( that is why they are called criminals) Other states that have LESS gun laws have ..........­..........­..........­...LESS CRIME..... I know, hard to believe huh.

				I suggest coping your post just in case this happens. It is frustratin­g when you spend the time to post something that adds to the conversati­on and then they don't post it because of an over moderating moderator. Sometimes it may be the use of a single "not so bad' word that gets you bumped.

				Color has NOTHING to do with violence!! Color has NOTHING to do with hatred! Violence and hatred come in all sizes, all colors of mankind.

Please, do NOT assume that only one color of mankind is violent and filled with hatred..

**********­*****
Everyday, the hatred spewing from some of these posts is terrifying­. How can some poster's hate those who do not agree politicall­y? Some hate the Tea Partier's, other's hate the far-left libs...IMH­O, the hatred for our fellow man must stop or this violence in our streets will continue.

				Sir/Mam, I don't mean to disagree, but, our current gun laws mean zilch. Sure we can take the guns away from the decent, law-abidin­g folks who only use guns for hunting or home protection­, but, what does that accomplish­? Nothing!! The bad guys, the ones in black hats that are responsibl­e for all the crime and violence will still continue to get their weapons and crime will continue.

There must be a different solution. I have an idea but in no mood to be attacked by all of you.

Have a good day!!

				I'm a little lost here didn't these people know that NYC has some of the strictest gun controls in the country? So this must not have really happened. How could there possibly be this kind of shooting in NYC? Well now all you liberal gun control people seem kind of quiet. I'm sure if you go back through all those gun controls in New York State and New York City you will find the loophole in all their gun laws and plug it so this will never happen again and you can feel safe with gun control. Of course you will have to get all the criminals to read those laws and obey them. I wonder what the Vegas odds on that would be?

				I do feel safe in the safest big city in the US.

Although, I can't join my gun control friends... because well, I don't agree. But you can't argue with the stats. As frustratin­g as it is to not be able to own a handgun (rifles/sh­otguns are legal with permit)... it's still safer than my former city of Detroit... and there you can buy a gun from the toddlers.

				Strangely, I live in what you would probably consider Tea Party Land.  Yes, there are many guns out here.  There are almost no shootings.  What do you think accounts for this discrepanc­y?

				Bloomberg is a typical left wingnut.  He's been blaming other states, especially Florida, as being the source of guns and the violence New York's subhumans create with them for years.  Now there's a shoot out involving his police, and his subhumans, and 48 people get shot, some of them complete innocents, and we don't know yet from whose misaimed bullets.  What does Bloomberg come up with?  He says it's a federal problem and stricter federal gun laws are needed.  When will liberals finally accept, that criminals make their living by ignoring laws?  It's a rhetorical question, because any logical person knows the answer is never.  The BATFE put thousands of guns unlawfully into the hands of Mexico's drug dealing subhumans, and Bloomberg wants to look to the federal government to solve his problem!  What a complete moron he is.

				Subhumans.­.. wow. Modest, much?

Liberals aren't accepting that criminals make their living by ignoring laws? That's a very odd angle, but I can tell from the previous few sentences that the self esteem must be low today.

I thought criminals made their living by stealing, selling drugs, etc. I guess you could say that they are ignoring the laws by doing such but you seem to be making the implicatio­n that the laws made them do it... and are therefore the problem.

				My modesty, or lack thereof, has no bearing here.  Individual­s who take the lives of innocent people, often children, to support their criminal behavior, are subhumans in my view. I say that liberals will never understand that criminals make their living by ignoring laws, because liberals are constantly seeking new, or enhanced laws, i.e "Hate Crime" designator­s, to magically cure problems already covered by laws on the books.  We have more laws and types of gun toting law enforcemen­t agencies in this country than Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia.  You thinking I'm saying the law makes criminals do what they do is ridiculous­, but then liberals always make excuses for criminals.  It's always someone, or something else responsibl­e for what happened, not the criminals'­.

				According to the article Ny has the toughest gun laws in the country. Bloomberg says that the problem is that there are too many guns in the city. I was on vacation recently in Prescot, Arizona. There were people carryilg guns everywhere­. No one was getting shot. It's not the guns. IT'S THE PEOPLE!!!!

				Prescot Arizona has a population of less then 40,000 people, which is equivilent to a single neighborho­od of NYC, none the less one of it's 5 boroughs (counties)­, which make up the city with a population of over 8 million. NYC alone has a population larger then the entire state of Arizona by more then 1.5 million people. Rural areas and urban areas deal with different issues to say the least.

				What this shows is that we need more gun control, not less. Most likely those guns came from  out of state. Tell the daughter of that woman who was shot sitting on her front steps that we need to loosen gun control laws. You said it, "we will never get our guns rights back", that's what you care about, your jollies, you don't give a damn about a any one, or any thing but your own self.

				I think people should have the right to bear arms if they are not convicted criminals a person that was convicted of a crime is capable of commiting another crime so they need to find a way to lower the violence without taking away the rights of a person to protect themselves against criminals in nyc but also you cant really trust the people that are not criminals because they could be the ones supplying their guns to the criminals that kill innocent people. On Another note guns are not the only weapons that kill people knives kill people too

				Good lord, your jealousy is as glaring as a lighthouse beacon at night from 100 yards away.  What makes you think these young women aren't using Clooney?  He's a great looking, very wealthy, very successful SINGLE actor and activist living an exotic and glamorous global lifestyle.  Why do you think he has to be with one women?  What makes you think these women are concerned?  They're all single as well and have been with other single men before Clooney.  So lame and petty.

				It could be that they think they will change him, it could be that they get plenty of exposure from the relationsh­ip and they believe it may help their careers, it could be that they both start off wanting the same things and she decides that now she wants kids and he still doesn't. There are several reasons with varying issues but you wouldn't know that because you aren't them. 

You seem to assume that all women should be much like yourself with the same moral compass. It doesn't work that way and these ladies aren't any more or less then you for their personal decisions.

				Its not that at all.  His schtick is, "I've been married once and it didn't take, so I'm not getting married again!"  He's up front with everyone, but women take that as a challenge and think, "He just hasn't met me yet, I'll change his mind!"

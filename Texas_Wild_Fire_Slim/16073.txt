NFL will let players wear special 9/11 tribute apparel this Sunday By      Doug Farrar



The story we reported Friday morning, about the likelihood that NFL players might be fined for wearing special Reebok apparel paying tribute to the 9/11 fallen, now has a happy ending.
The league that once threatened to fine Peyton Manning(notes) $25,000 for wearing high-top cleats in memory of the late Johnny Unitas has now decided that the specter of disallowing shoes and gloves that help memorialize the 10th anniversary of 9/11 would cause the kind of public relations nightmare that even the NFL itself couldn't quite get its arms around.
Thus, this Friday afternoon tweet from NFL spokesman Michael Signora:

Of course, the players' fear that they would be fined for wearing unauthorized apparel was not unfounded. Chicago Bears linebacker Lance Briggs(notes) put this series of messages out on Friday morning after Reebok sent Briggs his gear for Sunday:
Reebok great job on these gloves and shoes..looks like I'm getting fined this week. Lol! By far the best fine I will ever have to pay. Thanks…Fines for gloves could be as much as 5k..the shoes 8-10k I think. not 100% on the shoe fine.
Other players, like Tennessee Titans quarterback Matt Hasselbeck(notes), Washington Redskins tight Chris Cooley(notes) and Kansas City Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles(notes), added their public support to the idea.
And, at least one unnamed San Diego Chargers player told Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union-Tribune that he expected to see a $5,000 fine for wearing the specific clothing — a fine he seemed happy to pay.
So, while the NFL could have jumped on this story with a bit more urgency to insure that players wouldn't assume a fine, we send kudos for not sticking to the league uniform code in a situation where an exception clearly had to be made.
The NFL is already planning a series of 9/11 remembrances, and the league and NFLPA are combining to donate $1 million to various charities and memorials. To let a simple uniform issue get in the way of issues infinitely more important would have been a real shame.

• NFL commissioner's tough decision in the wake of 9/11
• 9/11 prompted NFL player to retire, head to Iraq
• Why do the Diamondbacks have a giant bone in their dugout?

The game will still be played the same and its just for one day.   And if it's good enough for Olympic athletes it should be good enough for the NFL.      GO   Steelers vs. Ravens always a great game.

So if they are islam believe me like any GOOD CHRISTEN that will not denounce JESUS CHRIST,So too will islam follow their Qur'an. TREAD LIGHTLY all you PC no minds they are not your friend!!! No matter how much they smile at you and say i am a victim they will eventually follow their religion.It would be easy for them to denouce their religion now that they are "GOOD' americans but no, they hang on, KNOWING what their DUTYS are as a good islamist. OH thats right they will be KILLED by their OWN for doing so .I guess we must be safe then from those NICE religious islams. WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0 users disliked this comment Kevin 16 hours ago Report Abuse . They do not want to believe that there is evil in the world. They can accept the fact that fires can happen, which is why they want fire extinguishers, fire sprinklers, fire alarms and fire exits throughout their kids' schools. 
But many of them are outraged at the idea of putting an armed police officer in their kid's school. Our children are thousands of times more likely to be killed or seriously injured by school violence than fire, but the sheep's only response to the possibility of violence is denial. The idea of someone coming to kill or harm

Facebook is facing yet another lawsuit.
A Northern Ireland man is suing the company, claiming that Facebook is "guilty of negligence" and had created "a risk of sexual and physical harm" after his 12-year-old daughter uploaded provocative pictures to her page, according to the BBC. Perhaps more importantly, the father is also upset because of his daughter's age.
While Facebook maintains a policy of verifying that users are over 13, there are no checks in place to make sure they're telling the truth. At the time the lawsuit was filed, Digital Trends reported, the girl's father claimed that Facebook had not yet removed the girl's profile.
"My own personal view is that Facebook isn’t suitable for under-18s, but the company isn’t even able to uphold its own policy of keeping under-13s out," said Hilary Carmichael, the father's lawyer told Digital Trends. 
According to the BBC, while Facebook has "come a long way" in terms of privacy and age verification, there still aren't enough checks in place. Carmichael, as a result, is advocating for a passport verification system to better track who is using the site.
Privacy issues have long been an issue for the social network, but there seems to be little they can do in regards to age verification. While this example may show how easy it is to lie and bypass the simple age check, the social network has pushed for less anonymity and more openness online.
“I think anonymity on the Internet has to go away,” Facebook's former head of marketing, Randi Zuckerberg, said in July, as reported by The Huffington Post's Bianca Bosker. 
In effect, stricter age restrictions and identification policies on Facebook could lead to less anonymity. Whether or not the lawsuit holds remains to be seen. 
Back in March, Australia's Daily Telegraph wrote that Facebook's chief privacy adviser, Mozelle Thompson, addressed the Australian Senate cyber-safety committee and said each day the social network removes 20,000 profiles believed to belong to children under 13. In May, a Consumer Reports survey found that 7.5 million underage users maintained largely unsupervised profiles against Facebook's policy.

				I know it doesn't fit with corporate usage, but given the number of individual users of operating systems isn't it about time for age restricted groups and applying that to browser and internet access? It would take Redmond all of 20 minutes to make user groups and ready them for installati­on, the rest would be browsers checking user group status (they check endless OS stats already) and sites enforcing such a status (browser info is passed already). It's not rocket science, it's something they could have instituted in the 90s if they chose to. The only problem is it has to be through OS manufactur­ers to be uniformly enacted, otherwise there would be no standard and too much difficulty keeping up with 3rd party implementa­tions, as we have now.

				I don't know what all the fuss is about. He seems like a very responsibl­e and loving father who wants the best for his daughter. As parents we cannot not watch our children 24/7 and monitor every little thing they do. All we can do is give them limitation­s and trust that they will abide by the rules. However, these are teens or near teenagers who think they know everything and want to mimic what they already see on a daily basis. On that same note that would leave open sites such as pornhub and tube8 (porn) who never ask your age. What shall we do with them? Monitoring your children and parenting is already hard enough without adding social networks. I remember back in the day (I'm 23) when sneaking on the phone was "bad", in my household anyway. Craziness

				He just wants the money.. or he would have blamed the person who did it not the billion dollor company. thats like the people who trip in walmart dont even get hurt and try to get a big pay out. It is rediculous that he doesn't punish his child who lied on the form for facebook to say she was older then she was. then in the parents home took dirty pictures of themself and used the parents computer to but them on. They made parental blocks for a reason, if you cant use them dont blame others for your bad raising skills. If it wasn't facebook it would be myspace or twitter, tagged, mocospace, or any of the hundreds of other websites that have or will be the next big trend. watch your child, how did she take the photos? i have a 12 year old sister with facebook. Me and my mother monitor her facebook daily. she cant take pictures without one of us looking thru them first. Its called parenting. You just dont want to do it unless you can get a big pay out right?

				The father is responsibl­e for the actions of his underage daughter. The father is also the LEGAL owner of the computer and the one who provides the access to the internet. It sounds to me that the father and the daughter should be arrested for child pornograph­y.

				So lets see....he can sue someone else for not supervisin­g HIS OWN KID?  Look DAD, it's your JOB to watch your OWN kid, not anyone elses.  How about we investigat­e you and why you don't know your pre-teen child is posting lewd pictures of herself on the internet.  i have a 13 year old daughter, and while i may not know every waking aspect of her life, she is mine to watch over and mine to be VIGILANT in finding out what shes doing. While she is a damn good kid, I do not live under a delusional cloud of my kid will never do wrong.  They are kids, and in some way they ALL will make a mistake in life.  Definitely your responsibi­lity, not facebook.

IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. I LIKE THE INTERNET BUT, FOR KIDS ITS SERIOUSLY DANGEROUS. IF THERE NOT WATCHED YOU CAN BLOCK WHERE TEY GO.

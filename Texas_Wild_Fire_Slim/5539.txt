What better way to kick off the school year than a friendly send-off by first dog Bo Obama?
Scholastic News kid reporters Jacob Schroeder and Topanga Sena were interviewing President Obama at the White House when the President called in the family's Portuguese water dog, who was a gift from Sen. Edward Kennedy.
The reporters were able to pet Bo before he wandered off away from all the flashing cameras. "He's not going to stay around too long, there is too much stuff going on," the President said in the Scholastic video.
Bo seems to enjoy being included in school events. Last year, Bo accompanied First Lady Michelle Obama to a Take Your Child to Work Day. A video of the event on ABC News shows him "helping" Michelle answer questions from the kids. 
The President's pooch has been photographed around the country. Check out these photos of his busy summer last year, soaking up the sun in Chicago, Maine and Martha's Vineyard.
WATCH Bo drop in on President Obama's interview:

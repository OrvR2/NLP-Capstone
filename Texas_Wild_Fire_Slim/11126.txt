George Clooney may not want to talk about his love life, but he isn't afraid to show it off… on the red carpet.
Clooney brought rumoured girlfriend Stacy Keibler to the "Ides of March" premiere on Sept. 9 at the Toronto International Film Festival, letting the former WWE wrestler take on the role of official girlfriend, formerly occupied by his ex, Elisabetta Canalis.
And although the two did not pose for photos together, it's clear that her presence at the premiere is a sign that Clooney wants the world to know that the two are definitely an item.

But Clooney wasn't the only leading man with a special lady on his arm at Roy Thomson Hall; his co-star, Ryan Gosling, had a pretty blonde to smile at the cameras with. The name of this mystery woman? Donna, Ryan's mother (Awwww!)
But we were kind of hoping that Gosling would bring his other leading lady, rumoured girlfriend Eva Mendes.
Gosling and Clooney star in the upcoming political drama, with Clooney acting as a governor running in the presidential primary race. Gosling plays a young hotshot press secretary that gets involved in the dark side of politics.

"Watching him work was like watching a unicorn being born every day," said Gosling of Clooney in a press conference earlier that day.
For the premiere, Gosling looked dapper in a Gucci suit and Lanvin shoes; but Evan Rachel Wood, his love interest in the flick, gave him some red carpet competition. The actress also rocked a suit — hers was a Dolce & Gabbana - which was inspired by Madonna's "Open Your Heart" video.

Marisa Tomei and Paul Giamatti also visited Toronto to promote their new movie. The "Sideways" star told Entertainment Tonight Canada that his acting teacher once told him to stop acting. Good thing he didn't take that advice!

The surprise guest of the evening was Bono, who had smiled for cameras the previous night at the premiere of the U2 documentary, "From the Sky Down." During his own premiere, Bono said he was interested in seeing Clooney's new picture- looks like he scored himself some tickets!

If Clooney was gay it would just make him sexier

One day all the kids were sitting around in Hollwood in a circle playing games they found that 'spin the bottle' wasn't working as the little boys were more interested in kissing each other. The children then decided to play 'broken telephone'  so they started eventually, the phrase in the phone game was " Andy Rooney is secretly Dumb" which of course ended up as "George Clooney is seriously Hung"...hence a star was born. This theory is the only reason I can think of that would legitimize the panty throwing antics of middle aged women who find chicken neck George so George-ious. At best he is a mediocre actor,passable direcotr and self involved philanthropist. When it comes to looks yes he is handsome but with so many good looking/sexy middle aged men out there in Horeywood and beyond...I just don't  understand the all the salivating?
Ms.Keibler (not the elf girl in the cookie commercial) has a striking look with killer stilts...But HULLO! have you seen Elisabeth Canales ( ClueMe's ex )the women is elegantly stunning with a derriere that would make a KarCashian or J(el)Lo drool.
Whatchu playin' at George/ette?

George Clooney reminds me of "The Picture of Dorian Gray."  I wouldn't be surprised to see an aging portrait stashed in his attic somewhere.

Right, George Clooney could be GAY.

He hires these beautiful women as trophy girlfriends.

Usually, he uses them for 2 years
then dumps them

The women get some publicity and other perks

No substance, what a loser. He only chooses females with a need for co-dependency, never a true intellect. Like selecting a car for the ideal enterance or for the time being.

He sure knows how to pick them, wow, his girlfriends are all beautiful. Beside his money and popularity (star) not sure why they go for him, crap just answer my own questions, money and a star, that wins you a beautiful girlfriend every time, lucky dog.

I guess being voted sexiest man alive has priveleges. Who'd believe it . . . . .

Ever notice that George Clooney never dates a woman known for her intelligence and accomplishments? Just vacuous, rather than brainy, arm candy. Some psychological defect there.

GeorgeClooney(like Derek Jeter) is living the life that any sane man dreams of. Fame,money, and gets to tear through every piece of hot tail within a solar system without it ever getting him bad press.

I tip my hat to this guy.

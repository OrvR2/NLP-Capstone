Bryan council backs Briarcrest road project


Tweet














					By MATTHEW WATKINS

A last-ditch effort by two Bryan City Council members to block the widening of Briarcrest Drive near Earl Rudder Freeway failed Tuesday night after a long debate. 
Council members Richard Cortez and Mike Southerland had asked the city to write a letter to the Texas Department of Transportation to kill plans for the project, which is now expected to break ground in August 2012. 
The council voted 5 to 1 to reject that idea. Cortez was the lone dissenting vote. Southerland underwent emergency heart surgery soon after he submitted the item for consideration on Aug. 14 and wasn't present at the meeting. 
Business owners who operate retail stores along the road have opposed the project for years, saying medians that are included in the plan will make it harder for drivers to access their shops. They have attended council meetings to speak out against it and had two representatives speak at Tuesday's meeting. 
But city officials said the $10 million project will make the road safer and less congested. Once completed, the 1.5-mile stretch of road will have a raised median, wider turn lanes, new traffic signals and a new lane on the eastbound side for drivers to turn right. 
The expansion will be paid for mostly by TxDOT. It was originally scheduled to be completed in 2010, but has been delayed due to difficulties buying right of way and funding problems at the state agency. The Bryan City Council first approved the plan in 2007. 
Dale Picha, Bryan's transportation director, said Briarcrest's current five-lane setup -- two lanes going each direction and a center turn lane -- becomes dangerous once a road has more than 35,000 drivers each day. Briarcrest, he said, averages between 35,000 and 40,000. 
"The medians help keep that traffic moving and funneled in a way that minimizes the left turns that create accidents," he said.
But Cortez said he worried that medians can sometimes cause even more danger. 
"I have seen a lot of accidents where people make a U-turn at a median," he said. 
In other action Tuesday, the council:
* Approved the second reading of an ordinance setting the 2012 budget for the city. The $373.7 million budget's first reading was approved last month. 
The budget includes more than $2 million in cuts from the city's general operations budget. It will not require an increase in the property tax rate, officials said. The council will meet to approve the tax rate at a special meeting Wednesday and then again at its regular meeting on Sept. 27. 
*  Approved the first reading of an ordinance that would lower the speed limit on F.M. 158 and Texas 30 from 70 to 60. City officials said the reductions are for safety reasons. 
*  Returned $100,903 to the coffers of Bryan Commerce & Development Inc. that had been allocated for the purchase of a building in Downtown Bryan. 
The building, located at 724 N. Main St., had been targeted for redevelopment, but city officials said the owner was asking for too high of a price. It is in the north part of downtown, which the city hopes will be developed into retail and residential buildings.

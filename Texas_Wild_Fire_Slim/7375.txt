       September 12, 2011 Exclusive breaking news BROOKSVILLE - A Hernando County, Florida, Fire Captain suspected of sexual harassment, stalking, and abuse of power may face legal action by the county. However, reports of sexual harassment and abuse are alleged to spread beyond the borders of Hernando County, Florida. According to a source familiar with the situation, charges may be brought against a Fire Captain who has shown "wanton disregard for policies and is abusing his office as well as harassing women." But the Fire Captain's sexual harassment allegations may be just the tip of the iceberg. Alleged abuse of power and sexual harassment is suspected of being widespread and may include government employees in both Hernando and Pasco counties, according to sources. Specific details on the charges against the Fire Captain have not yet been officially released, but county sources claim that the process of serving criminal and civil charges are underway.        1 of 1

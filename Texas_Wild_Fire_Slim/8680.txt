European stocks soar, euro rises after German court rulingAFP – 18 hrs ago

European stocks soared on Wednesday after a German court ruling approved eurozone bailouts giving investors a hope that a solution to the debt crisis may yet be found. 
The gains in Europe, a day after global markets had tumbled, were helped along by a strong openning on Wall Street a day before a key speech by US President Barack Obama in which he is expected to announce fresh measures to boost employment and stave off recession.
The euro also benefited, climbing to $1.4057 from $1.3992 late in New York on Tuesday. The dollar fell to 77.38 yen from 77.68 yen on Tuesday.
London's FTSE 100 index of leading companies climbed 3.14 percent to 5,318.59 points. In Paris, the CAC 40 jumped 3.63 percent to 3,073.18 points and in Frankfurt the DAX rose 4.07 percent to 5,405.53 points.
Milan rose 4.24 percent, Brussels 2.8 percent, Madrid 2.77 percent, Swiss stocks 2.5 percent and Lisbon 2.16 percent.
The Athens stock exchange's main index closed up 7.98 percent, cheered by government pledges to speed up privatisation and reforms days after EU and IMF representatives cut short a visit to determine whether to grant more bailout aid.
"A ruling in the German Constitutional Court to reject a series of lawsuits aimed at blocking German participation in eurozone bailouts was well received by the market," said Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index.
Germany's top court ruled on Wednesday that aid for Greece and rescues for other eurozone countries were legal, throwing out complaints lodged by eurosceptics.
However, the court also said that parliament must have greater say in any future bailouts and in so doing probably set the stage for a tougher approvals for any new rescues decided by the German executive.
In the landmark ruling, the Constitutional Court said all "large-scale" future aid packages must be approved by the parliament's budget committee, a process sure to create nervousness on markets, where speed is vital.
Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said that the ruling "shouldn't be seen as a blank cheque."
"Of a bigger concern is that this ruling could well complicate matters further, as the court insisted that parliamentary approval would have to be given for future bail outs. If other EU countries adopt similar rules which seems likely given the political toxicity now surrounding bailouts amongst voters in Europe then any future bailouts could well get bogged down in red tape," Hewson said.
The judges also insisted that parliament may not approve any deal that leads to a pooling of national debt, which analysts said may rule out the idea of "eurobonds" proposed by many as a possible solution to the crisis.
The court ruling comes at a time of high political tension in Europe's other major economies over the debt crisis, with governments struggling to get deep reform and austerity measures through parliament.
Investors were also still absorbing Tuesday's shock move by the Swiss National Bank when it announced a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 francs per euro, saying the high value of the franc was a threat to the economy.
"That such a move was deemed necessary highlights some of the stresses in the global financial system at present," Flor O'Donoghue, an analyst at Davy stockbrokers in Dublin said.
"Many of the concerns, of course, relate to the eurozone area. Among the recurring worries are whether the likes of Greece and Italy have the willingness to implement budget and debt measures and whether Germany is prepared to act as a backstop," O'Donoghue said.
On the European sovereign bond market, yields for Italy and Spain fell. The Spanish benchmark 10-year bond slipped under 5 percent to 4.981 percent, down from 5.166 percent, and Italy's 10-year dropped to 5.24 percent from 5.48 percent the day before. Germany bond yields still remained extremely low, at 1.904 percent.
In midday trade on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.61 percent to 11,318.14, the broader S&P 500 climbed 2.02 percent to 1,188.75, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 2.10 percent to stand at 2,525.81.
Wall Street was rallying on the news from the Germany and on leaked details from a make or break speech by Obama on Thursday as he unveils his new jobs plan.
The new employment initiative, which is crucial both to jolting the economy back to life and to replenishing Obama's fading political stock ahead of elections next year, will include the injection of $300 billion in the form of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and aid to state and local governments, US media reported.
"Markets are also gearing up a little ahead of a keynote speech tomorrow by President Obama who is expected to announce a new jobs growth strategy," Hewson said.
Earlier, Asia set the tone for the day. Tokyo jumped 2.01 percent, Seoul soared 3.78 percent and Shanghai closed up 1.84 percent.

I was curious on the non informational article above so I researched
it on the net and found this...My question was why did they say it was ok
the first time but not if it happens again???
THE GERMAN BUNDESTAG– FUNCTIONS AND PROCEDURES 
The Budget Committee not only considers the annual budget; it
also has the right to scrutinise and to be consulted on all laws
which involve expenditure (so-called finance bills). If a bill will
have an impact on the budget, i.e. if it will increase expenditure or
decrease revenue, the Budget Committee assesses whether it and
the measures it proposes are compatible with the overall budgetary 
situations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I have read tells me that they are supposed to be consulted...
Now to me the key words are: "it also has the right to scrutinize"...
If it said: "It Shall have the Right to Scrutinize"...
Shall is absolute!!! Now, it is Constitutional!!!
Has... Definition: is third person singular present tense of have...
Have... Definition: to hold or maintain as a possession, privilege, 
or entitlement...Unconstitutional/Constitutional....
As we are always told...One of those Grey areas...The court
then says: "all "large-scale" future aid packages must be approved by the parliament's budget committee"...
Here they covered their Asses but look closely at the wording 
"must be" so the circle begins once again...

Why do the future "large scale" aid packages need approval, but the first ones didn't.  Did the law just change?

More bailouts on Germany's back as Italy strikes, Greece riots, Spain, Portugal, and others in the toilet and protesting entitlement cuts as the euro spirals... This is not good long term news. What happens when Germany resigns and goes back to the Deutchmark? I hope the do.

Even governments know that the economic cure is right there in some deep pockets and spilling those pockets will get it done. The wealthy/corporations/banks are all afraid to be the first to risk it and would rather kill off everyone's income while waiting to see who will be "first into the pool". What they seem to forget is that if they want a healthy economic "garden" then they have to tend (seed/water/fertilize) it. Every day this continues we lose more respect for those that have big money,soon we will be out of respect and fill the acct with complete scorn/loathing/hatred. WAKE UP big money,,take your chance on PEOPLE,,we are all you've got in the long run anyway.

Yeah, that clarifies what the court ruling was!  Was it a small claims court ruling about a bent window screen?  What kind of reporting is this?

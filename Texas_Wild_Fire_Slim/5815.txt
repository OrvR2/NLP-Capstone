Giordano leave the "Rum Reef Restaurant" at Nanki, southern Aruba, on Aug. 2, 2011.

ORANJESTAD, Aruba -- An Aruban court on Wednesday rejected a Maryland businessman's attempt to reverse an order detaining him as a suspect in the presumed death of his travel companion in the Dutch Caribbean island.
The ruling from the three-judge panel means that Gary V. Giordano will have to remain in custody at least through the end of the 60-day investigative detention period imposed on Aug. 31.
"Of course he's very disappointed and sad about this decision," his attorney, Michael Lopez, said outside court.
Lopez had argued that authorities do not have enough evidence to detain Giordano as a suspect in the presumed death of Robyn Gardner, a 35-year-old woman from Frederick, Maryland, who traveled to Aruba with him for what was supposed to be a five-day trip.
Giordano, who is from Gaithersburg, Maryland, and owns a temporary staffing business, was arrested as he tried to leave the island on Aug. 5. Prosecutors have said they initially detained him because he gave inconsistent statements about Gardner's disappearance.
The prosecution has disclosed little of the evidence against Giordano but has said he was the beneficiary of a $1.5 million accidental death insurance policy he took out on her before their trip.
Giordano has told Aruban police that Gardner was apparently swept out to sea as they went snorkeling off the southern tip of the island. Authorities have searched the coastline near where she vanished and parts of the island but her body has not been found. Richard Forester, an on-again-off-again boyfriend of the missing woman, said Wednesday that he is trying to organize a new search effort.

				Just look at her! Does she look like a "family girl"? I don't see it.

She probably alienated her family long ago.

The only "sad and wierd" part is all the plastic on that doll, and the poor fool who believed her lies while she ran off with another guy! 

One less worthless liar. Good riddance;)

				I believe there are more lies coming from GG. You don't know what type of relationsh­ip she had with the BF at home, so IMO you can't job her. I think she was foolish to go fully knowing that he wasn't right from the first trip she cancelled. Maybe she was over confident that GG was just in love with her, when he was abusive with his reaction from her cancelling the first trip. Family girl, probably not, and possibly GG was paying her money. I think GG had an ultimate goal in creation of a willing victim for his scam. We still don't know if he had poilcies on other women he traveled with yet. FBI should disclose this.

As far as making assumption­s with what kind of girl she "was" let's not forget who the victim is here.

				Her mother landed there on the island the day before Gary slime went to the airport and lied to them, when they asked where his companion was, telling them his "travel companion" was taking a different flight.  Then the police, thank God, got there in time to arrest him before the plane departed.  

Her mother has every right to avoid the media in this time of emotional trauma.  Wouldn't any of us ?

				Another Profile of a Sociopath 

I hope that they somehow they still find her body or something. Keep looking for those blond hair extensions in Aruba. The glue will eventually break down in the ocean water. May look like tangled fishing line. Did they ever use dogs? 

-Glibness and Superficia­l Charm 
-Manipulat­ive and Conning 
-Grandiose Sense of Self 
-Pathologi­cal Lying 
-Lack of Remorse, Shame or Guilt 
A deep seated rage, which is split off and repressed, is at their core. Does not see others around them as people, but only as targets and opportunit­ies. Instead of friends, they have victims and accomplice­s who end up as victims. The end always justifies the means and they let nothing stand in their way. 
-Shallow Emotions 
-Incapacit­y for Love 
-Need for Stimulatio­n 
-Callousne­ss/Lack of Empathy 
-Poor Behavioral Controls/I­mpulsive Nature 
-Early Behavior Problems/J­uvenile Delinquenc­y 
-Irrespons­ibility/Un­reliabilit­y 
-Promiscuo­us Sexual Behavior/I­nfidelity 
-Lack of Realistic Life Plan/Paras­itic Lifestyle

				Yes, this is called the Bob Hare test named after a Canadian psychologi­st who worked, at the time of creating the test, was working as a prison psychologi­st. A person is rated from 0-2 on each of these traits or characteri­stics listed above. If they score a 30 or more out of 40, they are diagnosed with psychopoth­y. And there is no going back!

One question for the public: Look carefully at these traits and how many of them can be applied to people who run major coorporati­ons or hedge funds or anyone whose career could be seen as legal theft, or unethical to say the least

				So true. They are also very good at conceiling their negative attributes­. One would have to spend some time in close proximity to them before their charade starts to crumble. Their unreliabil­ity is often a smoke screen to help them avoid detection.

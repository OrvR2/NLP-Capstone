AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — Tonga captain Finau Maka doesn't expect a sore Achilles to stop him from playing against New Zealand in the opening match of the World Cup at Eden Park on Friday.His brother and coach, Isitolo Maka, revealed Finau, who has hardly trained for the last two days as a precaution, was the team's only injury concern when he announced his lineup on Wednesday.Isitolo Maka didn't sound 100 percent convinced on his brother's fitness, saying he'd likely play "but we'll finalize the team tomorrow."However, Finau, sitting alongside him, added, "he's thinking like that but I'm playing."Finau wants to see how his Achilles feels during the captain's run on Thursday.Meanwhile, Tonga has made four changes and two positional switches to the team which beat Fiji 32-20 in Lautoka in its last warmup match two weeks ago.Most of the changes are in the backline, where fullback Vunga Lilo has swapped places with winger Viliame Iongi, and Brive center Suka Hufanga, in his third World Cup, and Bordeaux-Begles' Andrew Ma'ilei have been recalled to form an experienced midfield.In explaining the backline changes, Isitolo Maka said they were seeking to match New Zealand's speed "with the fastest guys we've got.""I have faith in our backline — we can move the ball wide."The only changes in the forwards see the return of Cardiff Blues tighthead prop Taufa'ao Filise and Lyon lock Paino Hehea.More than half the side has played fewer than 10 tests. Nine players are in France, and the rest spread about New Zealand, Australia and Japan.Even so, it feels like a home game, Finau Maka said."Most of the boys grew up here (in New Zealand) just like myself. Some of them also played for Auckland. It's home away from home for us and it's just another boost," the big backrower said. "There's no pressure on us but pressure on them. We've just got to go out there and give it to them and see how they handle it."___Tonga: Vunga Lilo, Viliame Iongi, Suka Hufanga, Andrew Ma'ilei, Siale Piutau, Kurt Morath, Taniela Moa; Viliami Ma'afu, Finau Maka (captain), Sione Kalamafoni, Joe Tu'ineau, Paino Hehea, Taufa'ao Filise, Aleki Lutui, Soane Tonga'uiha. Reserves: Ephraim Taukafa, Alisona Taumalolo, Kisi Pulu, Sione Timani, Samiu Vahafolau, Samisoni Fisilau, Alipate Fatafehi.

Wildfires scorch Central Texas

Cooler temps at last
There was some good news in the winds that spurred on Central Texas wildfires: They heralded much cooler weather.
Sunday’s high temperature of 100 degrees will be the last triple-digit high for a while. A cold front — the source of the heavy winds — is forecast to bring a low this morning in the mid-60s, the coolest it’s been since late May.
This afternoon’s high is expected to stay in the mid-80s — and that hasn’t happened since mid-May.
— Joseph Abbott





Firefighters throughout Central Texas battled wildfires Sunday fanned by winds gusting to  40 miles per hour.
The threat will continue today. The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning for 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. that includes McLennan County.
One of the worst-hit locations Sunday was the vicinity of the Tippie Ranch near Prairie Hill on U.S. 84 in Limestone County.
The blaze there had consumed about  3,500 acres by about 4 p.m. with every volunteer fire department in the county involved in the effort, said Texas Forest Service public affairs officer Mary Kay Hicks, of McGregor.
She said the fire had consumed a house and a trailer, and two firefighters had been treated for dehydration.
The Forest Service lent two single-engine aircraft to drop retardants and two helicopters and an “air attack” airplane to locate blazes. Some National Guard bulldozers were on the way.
Some people were asked to evacuate their residences, but at least one woman said she would stay and try to keep the flames away with garden hoses, Hicks said.
Smaller fires were reported off Battle Creek Road near Mart and at Mount Calm. A fire at Elm Mott had been contained by Sunday evening.
A wildfire in Navarro County destroyed eight metal industrial shop buildings in Corsicana and was threatening wooden structures early in the afternoon.
County Judge H.M. Davenport said three wildfires had spread to 2,000 acres and prompted evacuation of a sparsely populated area near Mildred.  No injuries had been reported.
The wildfire threat became so dire in the Austin area that the Austin Fire Department issued a public appeal for any and all available firefighters in the area to report for duty.
Wildfires scorched more than  6,000 acres in Bastrop County, just southeast of Austin. Bastrop police spokesman Michal Hubbard told the Austin American-Statesman that hundreds of homes were evacuated in the vicinity of the county seat and several structures were lost.
A wildfire in the Austin suburb of Cedar Park destroyed two homes and damaged two others Sunday. Wildfires also prompted evacuations of other neighborhoods in Cedar Park and some in the nearby Austin suburbs of Pflugerville, Bastrop and near Briarcliff.
Firefighters in Bosque County on Sunday continued to fight a fire thought to have been caused by a barbecue smoker being pulled down Farm Road 2114 on Saturday night. A sheriff’s deputy said he did not know how many acres had burned but knew of no damage to structures or injuries to people. But, some residents had been asked to leave their homes for safer locations.
Other residents were asked to evacuate in the path of a fire at Aquilla near Lake Whitney, but Hill County sheriff’s officers said the blaze was under control by late afternoon. No structural damage or injuries were reported there, either.
In Waco, firefighters subdued a 10-acre blaze at the intersection of south Fourth and Boyd streets. Assistant Fire Chief Patrick Kerwin said the first firefighters arrived about 1:30 p.m., and fire departments at Robinson, Golinda and Downsville all lent brush trucks. A city bulldozer also assisted. The fire had been reduced to hot spots by about 7 p.m.
Oncor area manager Mike Cain said winds and falling tree branches knocked out power to 2,200 customers in Waco during the day. By evening, power had been restored to all but 700, but crews expected to work into this morning to take care of the rest.
Hicks said the fire at Prairie Hill apparently was caused by a downed power line, but except for the blaze on 2114 in Bosque County, no possible causes were reported.
The  Associated Press contributed to this story.

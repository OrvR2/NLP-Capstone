Another Clue Puts iPhone 5 Arrival in Early October
Sprint won't allow vacations the first two weeks of month

(Newser) -
                                    Add this to the pile of speculation that the iPhone 5 arrival is only weeks away: Sprint has told its employees they can't take time off between Sept. 30 and Oct. 15, notes  Mashable . A company memo obtained by  SprintFeed  cites the "possibility of a major phone launch....

Sprint iPhone Said to Boast Unlimited Data
Company hopes that will differentiate it from competitors

(Newser) -
                                    Sprint will not only get the iPhone 5 next month, it will also be offering something its competitors aren’t: unlimited data. Or at least, that’s what sources are telling  Bloomberg . Neither Sprint nor Apple will comment, as the  Sprint iPhone deal  hasn’t been officially confirmed yet. Further...

Sprint to Get iPhone 5
But new Apple phone won't be here until October, sources say

(Newser) -
                                    The iPhone 5 will be available on Sprint's network as well as Verizon's and AT&T's when the new phone is launched, insiders tell the  Wall Street Journal . The device will hit the market in mid-October, not next month as many had expected, the sources say. The...

AT&T, T-Mobile Merger Bad News for Consumers
The consensus: 'Ma Bell is back'

(Newser) -
                                    Reactions to the surprise  AT&T-T-mobile merger  are pouring in, and, not surprisingly, most conclude this isn't a good thing for consumers:  The Bell telephone system—"aka AT&T"—was broken up in 1984 to increase competition, and the US telecommunications market was deregulated in 1996, again to ...

Sprint Unveils Two-Screen Phone
Kyocera Echo will run on Android, almost tablet-like

(Newser) -
                                    Keyboard, shmeboard. Sprint yesterday unveiled the eminently nifty Kyocera Echo, a smartphone that boasts a second touchscreen where other phones might have a physical keyboard. The screens can rest side-by-side—creating an effect that, the  Wall Street Journal  observes, is reminiscent of a tablet—or one can tuck under the...

AT&T's Network Is Worst in US: Consumer Reports
It's not just dead last in general—last in every city, almost every category

(Newser) -
                                    AT&T may claim to have the largest and fastest wireless network … but it also has the worst one, according to the latest Consumer Reports survey. When it comes to wireless providers, AT&T ranked dead last in general—as well as in every city. Last year, it came...

Reviewers loving hefty, feature-packed Sprint device

(Newser) -
                                    Sprint has been the punching bag of the mobile world for a while now, but that may be changing thanks to its lightning-fast 4G WiMax network—and the spiffy new Android smartphones that use it. First there was the HTC EVO, and now comes the Epic, part of Samsung’s...

                                    A plan to bring cellphone and wireless Internet service to New York's subway is set to start after years of delay. The $200 million project was hobbled by the recession but has been made viable again by a large financial commitment from Broadcast Australia,  Bloomberg  reports.

Corporate Twitter Accounts' Days Are Numbered
Smart people won't be doing this forever

                                    Ever sent a tweet to tech support? It beats the heck out of calling, Simon Dumenco discovered recently, when a whining appeal to @sprintcare yielded a prompt, personal, pitch-perfect response. Sounds great, right? Well, don’t expect it to last long, Dumenco writes for  Advertising Age , because the current corporate...

                                    The days are numbered for AT&T’s monopoly on the iPhone, with Apple set to produce a new version that uses the wireless network favored by the likes of Verizon and Sprint.

Court Backs Cell-Tower Haters
Aesthetics a valid reason for town to deny permission, Calif. judges say

(Newser) -
                                    Ghastly cell towers are proving to be little match for vista-loving communities: Palos Verdes Estates, a wealthy enclave near Los Angeles, took Sprint to court over proposed towers—and won, as have a number of other California towns. “You want cell coverage, but you also want beauty,” a...

                                    Android phones haven’t exactly taken off yet, but that could change thanks to the HTC Hero, a new Sprint-exclusive coming out Oct. 11 that’s “powerful, but different,” writes Walt Mossberg. HTC has tinkered with Android, layering its own “HTC Sense” software over it. Thanks to...

Great Network Won't Make Up for Boring Phones
Verizon has reach, but is way behind on sexy smartphones

(Newser) -
                                    Verizon’s network may be the envy of its peers, but its smart phones definitely aren’t, writes Priya Ganapati. Caught off guard by the iPhone phenomenon, the carrier has taken a very cautious approach to new devices, subjecting them to a long testing process. As a result, while its...

                                    Smartphones may be the future, but you may not need one just now, writes Marguerite Reardon of CNET. The iPhone and its pricey brethren probably have more features than the average user needs. Here are some cheaper feature phones that might meet your needs.

                                    Sprint will launch the much-ballyhooed Palm Pre smartphone June 6, two days before the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. Though this year’s WWDC isn’t expected to produce any new hardware, John Biggs writes for TechCrunch, the scheduling of the Pre launch is connected … probably. Though unlikely, Biggs...

                                    The US auto industry is teetering on the brink of destruction—and NASCAR isn't too far behind it. The Daytona 500, NASCAR’s Super Bowl, takes place Sunday, but business is stalling, leaving the costly sport looking for a lift, Sean Gregory and Steve Goldberg write in Time. “We...

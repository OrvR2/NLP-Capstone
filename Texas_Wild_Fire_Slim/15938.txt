					 BASTROP, Texas — A roaring wildfire raced unchecked Monday through rain-starved farm and ranchland in Central Texas, destroying nearly 500 homes during a rapid advance fanned in part by howling winds from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee. At least 5,000 people were forced from their homes in Bastrop County about 25 miles east of Austin, and about 400 were in shelters, officials said. The fire was the largest of dozens that have broken out across the state since Sunday. Huge clouds of smoke soared into the sky and hung over downtown Bastrop, a town of about 6,000 people along the Colorado River that has many...

Armed Mexican Navy Chopper Invades Texas, Buzzes Homes

Rather Unfortunate, but it seems the Foreclosure Firestorm will only increase and compound itself throughout the summer. The Alt-A loans will be resetting also, so a large bulk of soon to be former homeowners will find themselves in Negative Equity in relationship to Loan to Value. An estimated 2.4 million homeowners will lose their homes, multiplied by spouse and kids, truly an exodus that would put the Israelites to shame in number.

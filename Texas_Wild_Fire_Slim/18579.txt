Ed Cook

age: 57
height: 5' 11"
weight: 235 lbs
body fat: 8.0%






					In his thirties, Cook's only use for a superhero's cape would have been to obscure his protruding gut. His weight had ballooned to 243. His doctor told him he had to slim down or there would be dire consquences. He took this to heart. Doing his best Superman impression, Ed began training and cleaning up his diet like a man on a mission. His impressive results have rightfully made him one of the top inspirational members on BodySpace.

All About Stacks



HOW DO WE CREATE OUR STACKS?



					A supplement stack is a group of supplements that you take on a regular basis to help you reach your fitness goal. If you want to build muscle or get lean by losing fat, there are different supplements to help. A stack can be as simple as a multivitamin and protein powder, or it can be a larger group including products like creatine, glutamine, fat burners and more. When we create stacks our mission is to design the perfect combination of products to support your fitness goal. But how do we do it?
				

Top fitness experts give us advice
Thousands of customers give us feedback on their favorite products
We pick the companies that we trust
We've spent years gaining expert supplement know-how


					When you choose a Bodybuilding.com supplement stack, you're getting a money-saving, power-packed combo that takes the guesswork out of the equation.

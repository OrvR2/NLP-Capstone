AUSTIN, Texas -- Survivors of the Travis County wildfires can get questions answered and register for assistance with state and federal disaster recovery specialists in the village of Briarcliff starting Friday.
Survivors can meet with recovery team members in Briarcliff:
Sept. 16-17Fire Station #2801 Bee Creek RoadBriarcliff, TX 78669Hours: Friday, 1 to 7 p.m. and Saturday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Experts from the state of Texas, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) will be posted in the area to help survivors register and inform them about a range of disaster aid programs that may be available to them.
The Briarcliff visit is the first of several scheduled for Disaster Assistance Recovery Teams in designated disaster areas throughout Central Texas. Through Sept. 29, teams will also stop by Leander in Williamson County and Columbus in Colorado County, and return to Briarcliff in Travis County.
"Visiting with a recovery team is not a requirement for survivors who want disaster assistance," said Federal Coordinating Officer Kevin L. Hannes. "But the teams are one way for people to get answers to their questions about disaster aid and help with applying for it."
There are three ways to register: online at www.disasterassistance.gov, via web-enabled phone at m.fema.gov, or by calling FEMA toll-free at 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or TTY 1-800-462-7585. If you use 711-Relay or Video Relay Services, call 1-800-621-3362. Multilingual specialists are available by phone from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. local time seven days a week.

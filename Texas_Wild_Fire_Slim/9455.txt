Texas A&MÕs Chelsea Mocio lines up a putt on the 18th green Monday at Traditions Golf Club.




Texas women's golf coach Martha Richards repeatedly mentioned what a good test of golf Traditions Golf Club presents.
If that is true, and the average score at The 'Mo'morial would back Richards' statement, her team passed with flying colors on Monday.
The Longhorns posted a 2-over-par 290 to seize a nine-stroke lead after the second of three rounds.
Texas and North Texas, which bettered its first round of 315 by 21 strokes, were the only two teams of 12 to break 300.
UT (299-290--589) was nine strokes ahead of first-round leader Auburn. North Texas is 11 behind Auburn.
"I feel good about it. I thought yesterday we played well but left a few out there that we went out and got today," said Richards. "You have to eliminate the big numbers, and if the worst score you make is bogey you are going to pick up shots on the field out here because there are also some holes you can make birdie on."
For the most part, the Aggies were unable to eliminate the double bogeys or worse for a second straight day and are tied for fifth with Florida State after a 17-over 305.
"We still made some big numbers and it's just hard to make enough birdies to overcome big numbers," said A&M coach Trelle McCombs. "You have a chip shot and you mishit it or you don't hit it as well as you want to and now 
 you are mad at yourself and you are not in the right frame of mind to putt it in or give yourself a tap in."
Katerina Ruzickova was the lone Aggie to avoid having at least a double bogey. She bettered her first-round 74 by a shot and was 3-over par for the tournament, good for sixth individually.
"She knows how to handle herself, does everything you're supposed to do in terms of handing her nutrition," said McCombs. "She knows where her energy level needs to be to perform at her best."
Mary Michael Maggio had a colorful card, not recording a par until the 10th. She started her day with a double bogey and pulled two back with birdies on Nos. 7 and 8. She had four pars on the back nine, equaling her birdie total, which equated to a second straight 79.
Sarah Beth Davis had a solid round going until a triple bogey on the par-4 17th. She finished with a 76, one better than Susy Grunden. Chelsea Mocio had an 84.
Texas posted four scores of 74 or better, led by Nicole Vandermade's 71-72--143, which is tied for first with Auburn's Carlie Yadloczky and North Texas' Jacey Chun. 
"She's really maturing as a player and not a lot rattles her," said Richards of Vandermade, a Canadian who recently played in her country's Open. "She's had a good career and this is more indicative of what she capable of. She hasn't done this consistently [in the past], but she's had plenty of good tournaments."
Texas' Haley Stephens posted the best round on Monday, a 2-under 70, and was tied for fourth overall at even par along with teammate Desiree Dubreuil, who is playing as an individual.
Yadloczky, who shared the first-round lead with Kentucky's Ashleigh Albrecht, could have had held the lead on her own, but bogeyed 18 after watching her 80-yard approach shot not only fall short of the green but the creek in front of it.
"Stupid mistakes, three-putt or a chunk from 80 yards," said Yadloczky, laughing off her wedge shot that could have just as easily gone into the hazard and been a double bogey.
Yadloczky recovered from three straight early bogeys, playing No. 6 through 17 at 2-under.
"I've been hitting my tee shots pretty good and chipping, getting up and down pretty good," said Yadloczky, who finished second at the NCAA East Regional as a freshman. "Today, I couldn't get it close to the pins, but up and downs are what are getting me there."
A&M's Natalie Reeves led the Aggie 'B' team with a 73. Reeves started and finished with a birdie. Aly Smith matched her first-round 80 and freshman Patricia Garcia also shot 80.
NOTES -- All three individual leaders will be in the same pairing on Tuesday, going off No. 1 at 8:30 a.m. ... Scores improved on Monday, with 46 of 68 players bettering 80. In the opening round, only 36 players were in the 70s. ... The average score on Sunday was 79.04. On Monday the average dropped to 77.65. ... Only No. 8, a 483-yard par-5 played under par on Monday. The toughest hole is No. 3, a 391-yard par 4, at 4.71. There was not a single birdie carded on No. 3, which normally plays as the opening hole.

Team Leaders: Texas +13, 299-290--589; Auburn + 22 296-302--598.

Reese Witherspoon was reportedly struck by a car while jogging in Santa Monica this morning.
The accident occurred around 11 a.m. PDT as Witherspoon was jogging in the northbound lanes of Georgina Avenue. According to NBC LA a driver coming down 20th street failed to slow down and struck the actress. 
Law enforcement stated that the driver was apparently an 84-year-old woman, reported TMZ.
The 35-year-old actress was brought to a local hospital, but was later released after being checked for minor injuries. According to People, a representative for the star said that she is now "resting comfortably at home."

				I am glad Reese appears to be okay.  As a medical profession­al, I would advocate for yearly testing of hearing, sight, and driving in every driver over the age of 70 to 75, or when they have certain conditions­.  Individual­s with brittle insulin dependent diabetes could really be required to have a physical and be tested every year.  Their vision can go quite quickly.Individual­s with certain heart conditions should not be driving.  Individual­s on certain meds should not be driving.  There are so many situations which arise where the elderly or younger people are impaired, and physicians are loathe to report them to authoritie­s. I once had a patient who arrived for a relatively minor surgical procedure, but I hooked him up to an EKG monitor when I felt his pulse, while awaiting his formal EKG and other tests, and he got sent to Coronary Intensive Care instead.  He had to have a cardiac procedure and would have periodic transient ischemic attacks where he passed out.  That could not be corrected because of the severity of the blockages in both sides of his carotids and his heart, as well.  Then, he appeared and I was asked to administer anesthesia for cataract surgery on his second eye, as the first had already been done.  Under Medicare rules, a second cataract surgery was paid for only if the individual could not see to read, watch TV, get around, or drive.  The patient said he could read, get around, watch TV and take care of himself but he couldn't see well enough to drive.  There was no way he should have considered driving under any circumstan­ces with his carotid blockages, as he would suddenly pass out without warning.  I had a fit on the surgeon, but he kept saying the patient wanted the surgery and I kept saying that he was going to drive if he did the surgery and the surgeon did it, without my assistance I might add, and that old man drove and killed someone when he passed out about three months later.  The doctor should have been prosecuted for not telling the guy not to drive, for doing the surgery for the money, and for not alerting authoritie­s about the man.

				The story is about the actress being struck by a car, but why was she in the street ?  Are there no sidewalks or running lanes there ?   But the older generation needs to be checked for driving skill loss whenever there is a reason....  I know many older persons who drive well, but there are those who can not go the speed limit, and cause tie ups, and accidents, and can not even see well enough to drive, and use high beams all the time and do not dim them causing accidents !   I am an older person and still drive well, but if I get to where I can't see well enough, or can't drive the limit, then I will give up driving and get someone else to drive me !!!!   I don't care if you like that or not, but there DOES NEED TO BE TESTING FOR OLDER DRIVERS !!   EYE TESTS, AND ROAD TESTS !!  IF YOU CAN'T SEE GOOD ENOUGH, OR DRIVE THE SPEED LIMIT THEN GET OFF THE ROAD FOR ALL OF OUR SAFETY !!

				I'm glad she is OK.  I don't want to say an 84 year old woman should not be driving, because I know several that are very capable and responsibl­e drivers.  I do believe that after 80 it's time to check reflexes and vision to be safe.  I don't think that was the problem here.  It sounds like this is not a safe area for walking or running.  Perhaps a ban needs to be placed on that area and people exercising should find a safer area.

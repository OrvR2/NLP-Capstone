WATCH THE INTERNET'S NEWS NETWORK: www.NewsTsar.com Caylee was last seen by her grandparents in mid-June 2008. Casey Anthony waited a month before telling her family the toddler was missing. Her mother then called authorities. Anthony has said she was conducting her own efforts to find her missing daughter, but prosecutors contend Anthony was going to nightclubs, shopping and hanging out with friends during that month. Anthony wiped tears from her eyes as her brother testified that on the night of July 15, 2008 he had questioned his sister about why Caylee hadn't been seen by her family in weeks and wasn't home in the house she shared with her mother and grandparents. Anthony told her brother that Caylee was with a baby sitter and that she didn't want to interrupt her sleep schedule by getting her, Lee Anthony said. "Nothing was making sense to me," Lee Anthony said. "Why couldn't anybody get Caylee and bring her home?" After a few minutes more of questioning, Anthony told her brother that she hadn't seen her daughter in 31 days and that the baby sitter had kidnapped her, Lee Anthony said. He said Casey also claimed she had received a phone call from Caylee that very day.

VERIZON STRIKE CONTINUES

08-18-2011 (msnbc)NEW YORK — Thousands of striking Verizon workers will return to work starting Monday night, though their contract dispute isn't over yet. Both the company and the union say they have agreed to narrow the issues in dispute and have set up a process to negotiate a new contract. But the talks are likely to be contentious. The two sides still disagree on touchy subjects such as health care benefits, pensions, and work rules. About 45000 employees went on strike on Aug. 7, after their previous contract expired. They work in the company's landline division in nine states from Massachusetts to Virginia. Verizon says that it needs to cut costs in the traditional landline phone business, which is in decline as more Americans switch to mobile phones. The company has proposed freezing its pension and switching union workers to its non-union health plan, which has higher costs for employees. The unions counter that the landline business supports the growing wireless business and that Verizon, which earned about $3 billion in the first half of the year, can afford to maintain the benefits in the contract that expired on Aug. 6. They also say Verizon put too many proposals on the table. Of the 45000 striking workers, 35000 are covered by the Communications Workers of America, while 10000 are covered by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Jim Spellane, a spokesman for the IBEW, said the strike occurred because Verizon "came in with an extreme set of <b>...</b>

Clip from March 8, 2011, The Rachel Maddow Show where Rachel highlights the scary, dystopian corporate Republican efforts to use the manufactured "after shocks" of the economic crisis to overturn the will of Michigan and other states' voters, to bust unions unilaterally, and to turn (ie, privatize) traditional government functions over to their crony capitalists. In that context, Rachel examines "disaster capitalism" with Naomi Klein, the author of the best-selling book, "The Shock Doctrine."

	The World News (WN) Network, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to user privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for wn.com, as well as e-mail newsletters.
1. Personal Information Collection and Use
We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us. For example, if you submit an inquiry to us or sign up for our newsletter, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact details (name, e-mail address, mailing address, etc.).
When you submit your personally identifiable information through wn.com, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will use the information you provide us only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or in connection with the service for which you provided such information. We may forward your contact information and inquiry to our affiliates and other divisions of our company that we feel can best address your inquiry or provide you with the requested service. We may also use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, agents and partners.
We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.
In addition, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request.
2. E-mail addresses
We do not want you to receive unwanted e-mail from us. We try to make it easy to opt-out of any service you have asked to receive. If you sign-up to our e-mail newsletters we do not sell, exchange or give your e-mail address to a third party.
E-mail addresses are collected via the wn.com web site. Users have to physically opt-in to receive the wn.com newsletter and a verification e-mail is sent. wn.com is clearly and conspicuously named at the point of collection.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by e-mailing us at michaelw(at)wn.com
The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during registration and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure, however. Therefore, though we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If we decide to change our e-mail practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we think appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
If we make material changes to our e-mail practices, we will notify you here, by e-mail, and by means of a notice on our home page.

4. Business Transfers
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell certain aspects of our entities or assets. In such transactions, user information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets, and by submitting your personal information on Wn.com you agree that your data may be transferred to such parties in these circumstances.

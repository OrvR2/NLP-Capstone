Rather than featuring a quilt today, I’m hoping you will send me one of your own.
We are working to give every child who has lost everything in the Central Texas wildfires a quilt to sleep under.
Our goal is a quilt for every child who lost their home.
Quilts should be at least 45” x 60”, although twin size bed quilts are encouraged.
Please ship quilts to Valli & Kim Quilt Shop, Attn: Wildfire  Quilts, 700 West Highway 290, Dripping Springs, TX 78620. If you have  questions, please email me at moderndayquilts@gmail.com
If you are in Austin, I’ll pick the quilt up, just send me an email.
Please reblog, retweet, spread the word!

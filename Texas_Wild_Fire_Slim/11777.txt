TEXAS LANDOWNER SURVEY 2007









[ Print | 

 ]



In an effort to better serve Texas landowners, Texas Forest Service has issued a survey to assess landowner needs and address issues of importance to them.
Questions on the survey inquire about range and woodland ownership, reasons for ownership, demographics of owners, use of land, management of land, owner concerns, issues and future plans for their land, and practices of how landowners communicate and learn about land management.
Results of the survey will be used by policy makers, land managers and public and private service providers to better understand and address things that are important to Texas landowners.
The survey was distributed to people who own land in Central and West Texas and deals with land owned and managed outside of the eastern part of the state. Texas Forest Service already has comprehensive information about the needs, uses and issues concerning much of the forestland ownership in East Texas. The agency hopes to expand and enhance services and relevance to those landowners who own land in the central and western areas of the state.

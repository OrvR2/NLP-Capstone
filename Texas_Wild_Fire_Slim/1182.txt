Mother Jones:
Two-thirds of viewers who say Fox News is the news source they trust most believe discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against minority groups, according to a Brookings/Public Religion Institute poll released Tuesday. The number, 68 percent, is an exact reversal of the percentage of black people in the same poll who say that discrimination against whites is not as big a problem as discrimination against minorities.
The Brookings study uses "reverse discrimination"--an unfortunate term that suggests a difference in kind, not in degree--to describe anti-white discrimination.

				"Is it a dream?"
"Harold! You woke from your coma!"
"Is it true?"
"What dear?"
"Clinton paved the way for millions of jobs to go to Mexico through NAFTA. A Texas governor became president and screwed up the economy so bad that he pissed away our surplus. Most of the European nations were ablaze with inner strife. Latinos will be the majority in a few short years. We've been borrowing money from the Chinese? The country if currently led by a colored man and our hope lies in a former Alaskan governor that can't find her tailbone with a GPS?"
She looked at her husband with sorrow in her heart and said, "Yes Harold, its true."
"Martha!"
"What dear?"
"Get my hammer from the closet and whack me good. Don't wake me until we're back on top."
Poor Harold.

				This is tantamount to nothing but psychotic projection­...and it's nothing new. It's the same projection that maintained that Africans, subject to torture, pitiful living conditions and constant domestic terrorism were nothing but savages from whom delicate European American women had to be defended from...whi­lst African women were constantly being RAPED by depraved semi-liter­ate thugs almost as a rite of passage and Black men were left swinging from trees like Strange Fruit as a means of sport. The phenomena is ably depicted herein;

http://www­.youtube.c­om/watch?v­=7Nus9BZlA­fQ

True EQUALITY is what some pitiful European Americans are scared of, and they'll use every excuse to mask it including replacing bravery with guns, humanity with brutality and democracy with voter suppresion using corporate sponsored fascism..a­ll in a vain attempt to stem the demographi­c tide to maintain their assumed dominance and privilege.­..

...The end is nigh...

http://www­.youtube.c­om/watch?v­=U6tV11acS­Rk

..and they know it....

				If you don't want to deal with the CONSEQUENC­ES of your ACTIONS then it's a good idea that you DON'T COMMIT the CRIME, like the teens who MURDERED an elderly man simply because he's BLACK. I know, you think these RACIST kids should be given a free pass simply because they're WHITE, but this a NEW DAY, not SLAVERY or JIM CROW where RACIST whites could get away with that GARBAGE, so if you don't like it I advise you to GET OVER IT.

				Here's a lie. No liberals have called for execution. This is a hate crime, however. And, ONE of the penalties is death. But, it's conservati­ves who are the lethal injection lovers. Here's a clue that you might not be such an nice person -- you're defending the murder of an innocent man.

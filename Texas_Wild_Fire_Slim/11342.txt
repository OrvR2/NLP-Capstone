May 11, 2011 – WEST TEXAS – The National Weather Service forecast for today shows potential for high-impact fire weather over the Panhandle area of Texas. An area of extreme concern is west of a line from Wichita Falls to Abilene to San Angelo to Del Rio. Unprecedented drought conditions across the state, combined with low humidity and high winds, will increase the potential for wildfires that could spread at a rapid pace, placing lives and property in harm’s way.Evacuations are common under these conditions, said Texas Forest Service Fire Operations Chief Mark Stanford. Although some areas have seen recent rains, it’s not enough to prevent wildfires because of the severe drought. In addition, several recent fires have ignited due to lightning, which is in today’s forecast for portions of the state. You can use Texas Forest Service resources to monitor the current wildfire status and create a wildfire action plan for your home.

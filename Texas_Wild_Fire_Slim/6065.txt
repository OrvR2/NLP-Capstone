Two Denver Police officers -- Devin Sparks and Randy Murr -- who were fired back in March over a vicious 2009 beating of 24-year-old Michael DeHerrera outside of a LoDo club that was caught on video have just gotten their jobs back, according to CBSDenver.
UPDATE:
The Denver Post reports that the city will appeal the decision to reinstate both Denver police officers Devin Sparks and Randy Murr. City Attorney Doug Friednash will also ask for a stay on the reinstatement of both officers until the Denver Civil Service Commission hears the appeal -- meaning both Sparks and Murr could not return to work while the appeal is pending.
Mayor Hancock is also calling for an appeal, 9News reports, saying: 
According to the city attorneys that I've consulted with, the decision yesterday was a very narrow one. And one that leads us to believe that we need to make the effort to vigorously defend the original decision by Charlie Garcia.
EARLIER:
Fox31 reports that Charles Garcia, Denver’s former manager of safety, fired the two officers in 2009 when they both lied about the beating in their police reports.
But in a case filled with controversy, a panel of civil service officers just added more by reversing Garcia’s decision Tuesday on grounds that the two officers had already been punished by Garcia’s predecessor Ron Perea and could not be punished again as the time limits for appeals had already passed, according to 9News.
DeHerrera, expressing his disappointment in the reinstatement of the two officers, said to 9News:
It was finally clear what was right and what was wrong and everybody agreed that they were wrong. So now to put that back up into the air is just ridiculous.
On the night of April 4, 2009, DeHerrera and his friend Shawn Johnson, were kicked out of a LoDo bar, The Denver Post reported. As Johnson was being arrested, lying in the street, DeHerrera was talking on his phone. Then, apparently without provocation, Officer Sparks grabbed DeHerrera and repeatedly struck him with a piece of metal wrapped in leather. However, the police report reflected an entirely different story -- which Police Independent Monitor Richard Rosenthal called “pure fiction” -- one where Sparks claimed DeHerrera tried to attack Sparks so the level of force used was seemingly justified.
7News spoke with Nick Rogers, President of the police officers union said that the firings were based on “political outcry,” suggesting that the two officers never deserved to be fired as a form of punishment. Rogers went on to say that the two officers are “as happy as a person can be” with the reinstatement decision.

				Shoe5005, cops are no smarter than you. Actually, some are really stupid. (like the ones in video) When the American people see the police doing wrong....t­he public need to get hands on & STOP the police. You're afraid of what cops might do? Think about it....if there's 20 cops & 90 people watching..­..who's out numbered?  These cops NEED a great dose of their own medicine.

				Even with cameras rolling. it's a joke when the police investigat­e their own department­. You really don't think they ever be in favor of a person that gets beat down by some insecure cops, do you ? To think these cops think it's nothing but a joke and that they are the victims only tells you that there are more goverment badged bullies in this country, and their coming to a town near you before you know it. Anyone can sit in a classroom for 18 months and then go through the police academy to become a cop. Where else can you get god like powers that fast?

				This is nothing new at all. crooked cops are everywhere and they lie all the time. In my city,Manch­ester,NH. we just put a cop in jail for 30 days for breaking a mans jaw when he was off duty and said the guy grabbed his girlfriend­s butt. There was no proof that he even brushed up against the girl. The cop lied and was caught in that lie and lost his job and was placed in jail for 30 days. Cops have very fragile egos and this is why they are cops. It gives them instant god like powers that help them with their insecurity and ego problems. Get use to it people.I'v­e been on the wrong end of a bad cop before and it gets you nothing. just yes them and they will go away. You argue and mouth off, and your asking for trouble..

				In a recent listing of the most dangrous jobs in the US, police officers were ranked last--just below drivers. Fireperson­s were not on the list at all. It is pure myth that police and fire personnel deserve to retire at age 50 because their jobs are so dangerous. Most fire personnel can count on one hand the number of actual fires they go to in a month. Eighty percent of all calls to the firehouse are for the paramedics­.

				Any cop that uses this line of thought should change jobs. If two intoxicate­d young men (with one already on the ground in cuffs) can be treated like the kind of human trash you are describing­.......get a different job. These cops are loose cannons. If they were not cops, the people behind this beating would have stopped it. The kid was talking to his Dad (who is a cop by the way) when this officer threw him to the ground and pounded him with a club. Animals like this should never again hold law enforcemen­t jobs anywhere again.

				This is about power and what other better profession to pick than being a police officer. I have had my rights violated so many times by police officers I could go on and on. 

One time I parked very close behind a police car and was infront of the no parking sign like I needed to be, I looked to make sure they had enough room to get out before I existed my vehicle and then I went in the store. When I came out I had a ticket because according to the store clerk another car parked in front of the police car and boxed them in and the police woman was mad and wrote me a ticket. this is just one small example. I think it is human nature for people to abuse the power that they may have been given, it's quite sad actually.

Why these police officers even want their job back after they violated this man's rights like this is strange, they should admit they did something they never should have done and move on to another profession­.

				We need policemen!­!! However, we don't need thugs in uniform and unfortunat­ely we see far too many cases where law enforcemen­t feel that they are the law rather than representi­ng the law. What always seems odd to me is that these men will claim to be upholding the law, yet think nothing of violating it with what is clearly unlawful antisocial behavior of their own.  I come from a family with many law enforcemen­t officers - all with the same rant "you don't understand what we have to go through."  Well, yes we all do understand­...what they don't understand is that being a law enforcemen­t officer of any type does not give you the right to behave in an unlawful manner - regardless of what you think you are experienci­ng - that is not your privilege!  There are no excuses that can be offered for anything less than lawful behavior.  If you can't manage your personal feelings under stress - quit and get another job.

				The first officer clearly attacked the guy on the phone, with no apparant provocatio­n. What I would like to know is why, when the beating started, the camera pulled back so that you couldn't see what else happened very clearly, if at all. The officers involved should not hold another office of any knid of power.

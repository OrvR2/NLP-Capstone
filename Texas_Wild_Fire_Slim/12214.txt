On any given day in Texas, the Lone Star State Incident Management Team (LSSIMT) may be called upon to provide leadership for any variety of disasters occurring at opposite ends of the state or in other states across the country. Whether it is a raging wildfire in North Texas, a flood in South Texas, the recovery of the Columbia Shuttle in East Texas or a Hurricane along the Louisiana Gulf Coast, LSSIMT has been there. LSSIMT is an all-hazards incident management team (IMT) that works on the same organizational skills used in suppressing wildfires. IMTs have the capability to organize and manage the response to disasters by employing the Incident Command System (ICS). The teams will receive a mission, plan an appropriate response, execute the plan, and support the personnel and equipment involved in the operations. The ICS allows the team to organize and respond to any type of disaster – including wildland fires, hurricanes and the Columbia Shuttle recovery effort. LSSIMT members are capable of remaining active on an incident for up to 21 days at a time and must be self-sustaining for 72 hours.When a disaster occurs in Texas and it exceeds the capabilities of the local government, LSSIMT may be ordered by the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) to respond.FEMA Incident Command System information.

Sept 11, 2011 Bastrop County Unified Command ReleaseIncident: Texas Fires 2011 WildfireReleased: 4 days agoBASTROP COUNTY FIRE COMPLEX UNIFIED COMMAND NEWS RELEASE  MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION ISSUED-PROGRESS CONTINUESSaturday, September 10, 2011, 2:30 PM As progress on the Bastrop County Fire Complex continues, State Highway 71 was re-opened today at 8 a.m. Union Chapel residents were also able to return to their homes today at 10 a.m.Judge Ronnie McDonald announced at a press conference today that a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of Texas was issued by President Obama, triggering release of funds to help individuals whose homes and property were destroyed by the Bastrop Complex fires. Individuals are encouraged to register with FEMA by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or:Those who use 711 or Video Relay Service (VRS) can call 800-621-3362.Apply for disaster assistance online at http://www.disasdterassistance.gov/.Smartphone or tablet, use m.fema.govFEMA's App for android phones download at market.android.com/details id=gov.fema.mobile.android Hotel vouchers are also available beginning today for those currently living in shelters. This allows citizens whose homes were destroyed to move from makeshift shelters into motels until more permanent housing is re-established. Vouchers may be picked up at shelters. Residents may also dial 2-1-1 for statewide services and disaster information.Sheriff Pickering emphasized that, "Fire crews and utility crews are working hard in order to get residents back into their homes as quickly and safely as possible." He stressed that unsafe conditions prevent allowing residents to re-enter during this phase of work. After a fire burns through a residential area, many hazards still exist because of the disruption of the infrastructure in place such as affected electrical, water, gas, telephone lines, crude oil wells, roads, dead trees and limbs, and smoldering stump holes. Re-construction and re-charge of live electrical power lines is also taking place by 120 utility crews in order to restore power so residents may return to their homes. Fire crews are cutting and removing hazard trees that may fall at any time with light wind gusts. A night shift of firefighters is patrolling the perimeter of the fire to ensure hot spots are extinguished so that fire does not flare up. An infrared flight has been conducted for the last three nights to detect hot spots within and around the fire perimeter so firefighters can be directed to these specific areas. Law enforcement is patrolling evacuated areas at all times to prevent looting.

Fire Status: The Riley Road fire, also referred to as the Tri-County fire, continues to grow in size due to the extreme drought conditions in the area. Overnight fire intensity was reduced due to light southerly winds bringing in moisture from the gulf.

Weather predictions for today include more hot and dry conditions with north-northwest winds at 5-10 mph gusting up to 15 mph. Fire behavior is predicted to pick up again this afternoon as moisture levels drop off. The southern edge of the fire remains the hottest and most active part.Firefighters will work throughout the day to install fire lines along uncontrolled fire edge, widen existing fire lines, and mop up hot spots along the perimeter and 100 - 500 feet into the interior. Crews will also be vigilantly patrolling the entire fire perimeter, watching for for slop overs. Air resources are a critical part of the firefight and will continue to work closely with engine and dozer crews on the ground. The 11,000 gallon DC-10 Air Tanker will be supporting these firefighting resources again today. Totsal Aircraft resources on the fire include: 4 Single Engine Air tankers (SEATS), 4 Black Hawk Helicopters, 1 Type One Helitanker, one DC-10 Air Tanker, 1 Type Two Helicopter, and 1 Type Three Helicopter.

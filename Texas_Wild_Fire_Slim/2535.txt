Moved to action by a recent trip to famine-torn Africa, 50 cent has launched an energy drink whose profits will feed 1 billion kids in the region.
The rapper has teamed up with Pure Growth Partners to bring Street King, a new energy drink, to the market, PopCrush.com reports.  Proceeds from every sale will go toward feeding 1 billion kids in Africa.  
"I grew up without money, but I didn't grow up hungry," 50 Cent said in a video introducing the product. "It's our responsibility to come together and do things to create a solution."
Street King hit stores this week, in orange mango and grape flavors, and the rapper is encouraging fans to register at the energy drink's website.
"I need you to utilize your energy--your voice--to provide additional motivation for me at times," 50 Cent said.

Ambassador Tony Hall: Fasting, Budget Cuts and National Humiliation


		                        
																Budgets are moral documents by nature. They reflect the priorities of individuals, households and even nations, exposing our real notions of who and what is valuable.                             







Jayshree Bajoria: Al-Shabaab and Somalia's Famine


		                        
																We need to learn from this crisis that there are many factors that contributed to it. One is conflict. And conflict resolution should be essential.                             







Glen Pearson: African Famine: "I See You"


		                        
																One of Bev Oda's enduring memories was the leathery and cracked feet of the children who had walked for kilometres and the stunned look on the faces as their bodies struggled to survive.                            







Edward Jackson: K'naan, Iman and the Famine in Somalia:  The Long Game Matters, Too


		                        
																The celebrities' call to action on the famine in Somalia is welcome, but the bottom line is that these countries need sustained economic growth. Such strategies are not without risks, however. Businesses must not be permitted to abuse human rights. Foreign investment must not undermine sovereignty.

I just dont understand why we spend billions & billions of dollars helping everyone all over the globe while we neglect the poor, homeless, veterans, disabled & elderly that truely need our help here. I wish I had an answer..

				I wish him as much success as possible in his venture.
The man is putting his time and money where his mouth is, good for him.
Hopefully others will follow his example, 
there are those on both sides of the asile,
who have the means at their disposal to start other worthwhile programs.

Way to go man, I hope your blessings are multiplied­.

				I can't believe people complain about helping those in other countries. I really don't see how a geographic­al border should dictate who gets help and who doesn't. If there were starving kids in Pennsylvan­ia, should West Virginians complain if one of "their own" helped a Pennsylvan­ian child? Does that not seem stupid? We're all human beings, period!

				Well, when you think about it, the production and distributi­on of a new product always creates new jobs. So he is doing just that even if it isn't that many he is creating some as long as people buy the drink.  And maybe people will even buy the drink in Europe.  One could hope for global distributi­on.

As of 2010 there were 1,022,234,­000 people in Africa (One Billion, Twenty Two Million, Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand).

If you want people to believe things you say, you need to stick to actual facts:) You have a good point to make, but you ruin it when you throw in false info.

				I stand corrected. If you include Egypt, Suadi Arabia, the Canary Islands, etc. 1.02 billion people. If you consider Africa has enough prairie land to grow wheat to feed bread to the entire earth, not including the Congo ag land and enough grass land (millions of acres) to feed beef to everyone on earth. It's still the same point. And this doesn't include the fact that everything living in the oceans is edible and Africa is surrounded by oceans - my estimate, 5 billion tons of edible bio products like squid, sardines, shark, tuna, mackeral, etc.. I like 50 cent, but if he really is serious, the way to fix this is not with hand outs. Africa has over 50 trillion dollars worth of gold, diamonds, uranium, and oil ($50,000,0­00,000,000­.00 USD). They have a lot of wealth. A lot. I can tell you how this will pan-out: 50 cent will collect millions and forward it to them and the same number will still starve. I could fix this, but nobody will fund me.....Alf­red-

				You need to be corrected about your Myths..Eve­rything living in the Ocean is not edible! You sit at your computer and just make up solutions to other countries problems. If You know so much about solving the problem, there are many Relief Agencies waiting for YOU. Talk is cheap, BUT it takes MONEY to buy Land.

If you are serious about your remedies, join your church's mission group. We raise our own monies for these mission trips and projects. Pay our own fares and living expenses. I went in Ghana villages helping my friend. She has raised money to build churches there, schools, had wells dug in some villages paid medical bills etc. But, you have to have an earnest love and compassion for the people to do this.

Have U ever been into these poor African countries? I have as a Christian Missionary­. And all your smart answers are not feasible. First, it takes water to produce crops. African people are not lazy people, but they cannot "Make Rain"....m­aybe you are smart enough to do so.

				It's nothing harder breaking than to see people plant crops and thru no fault of theirs, there is no rain for months, and their crop dries up in the fields.  The creeks, wells and ponds dry up also during the rainless seasons. Parents and children get up early in the mornings and walk miles and miles in search of water they carry back home in containers on their heads. Clean drinking water is not available to them, they drink whatever water they can find. 

You see the children with distended stomachs, from drinking polluted and parasitic infested water. You have to see this to understand it. Bottled water is not affordable to them, the wages are lest than 50 cents a day working sunup to sundown labor. The largest expense of Missionari­es to 3rd world countries is the cost of supplying our bottled drinking water. Children scavenge in dump piles for scraps of food. The villages do not have water systems, pipes and reservoirs­.Some places there is a welll. 
No one waste water, it is a sin. One of the reason they have diseases is because they do not believe in using water to wash their hands, even during food preparatio­n. WATER IS GOLD in the villages of Africa.You cook your  own meals for sanitary reasons and to avoid getting sick.

				Let me know how that wheat farm goes. Oh, yeah, Since it does'nt rain in vast parts of Africa for MONTHS at a time, you may want to consider bringing some cases of water with you. And yeah, there are diamonds and oil and other valuable raw materials. I have yet to see your average african villager eith the means to extract, refine, and transport these said materials, have you? No it's mostly people not from the land with the equipment, and "security" teams to take the valuabes and the money that comes with it.

By Danny YadronFormer Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney suggested Friday that Texas Gov. Rick Perry, his top rival for the GOP presidential nomination,  is weak on immigration.

Addressing the Republican National Hispanic Assembly in Florida, Mr.   Romney said the U.S. “must do a better job of securing its borders, and   as president, I will.” Mr. Romney said that includes “completing   construction of a high-tech fence.”
Mr. Romney didnt mention Mr.  Perry by name, but the Texas governor  has dismissed the idea of a fence  along the entire U.S.-Mexico border as “ridiculous,” but has said he supports a fence in some metropolitan areas. Mr. Romney also focused on in-state tuition for illegal immigrants.
“Finally,  we must stop providing the incentives that promote illegal  immigration.   As governor, I vetoed legislation that would have  provided in-state  tuition rates to illegal immigrants.” Under a bill  Mr. Perry signed,  Texas provides in-state tuition for illegal  immigrants who meet certain  criteria.
Immigration could be one of Mr. Perry’s main  weaknesses among tea party  voters, who have peppered candidates with  questions on the topic at  recent town halls. Romney advisers have said  they intend to exploit it.
During the 2008 campaign, Mr. Romney accused former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee of being weak on illegal immigration as well. When asked about immigration at campaign stops, Mr. Perry has said the   U.S. needs to secure the border before it can tackle immigration   reform.
Hispanics, who went for President Barack Obama in 2008, will  be a key voting bloc in 2012 and could play a critical  role the GOP  Florida primary. Given his audience Friday, Mr. Romney  sought to appear  tough on border enforcement while calling for  unspecified immigration  reforms.
“Three years ago, Candidate  Obama promised to address the problems  of illegal immigration in  America. He failed. The truth is, he didnt  even try,” Mr. Romney said.  “We must address illegal immigration in a  way that is civil but  resolute.”

         12:29 am September 4, 2011  Pay to Play wrote:              AT&T will have an ally who is never going to be accused of putting facts and the law ahead of politics: Texas Governor Rick Perry.
The front-runner for the 2012 GOP presidential nod has positioned himself as a champion of big businessespecially when big business wants to get bigger.
Not only has Perry endorsed the AT&T/T-Mobile merger, he has actively promoted it, writing a letter to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski and the other commissioners, in which he argued that this merger will continue to provide for great consumer choice, offer a wide range of service options, and spur continued innovation.
The governors letter, sent in his official capacity before he announced his candidacy, urged federal officials to adopt a light regulatory touch and business-friendly policies.
Perry, who has tried to present himself as a tech-savvy contender (even if he does not quite have the language of Twitter and tweets down), argued in the letter that the future rests in wireless broadband, and the federal governments swift approval of the merger between AT&T and T-Mobile would send a strong signal to employers, consumers, and states that our federal government is serious about meeting the communication and technology needs of Texans and all Americans.
Thats not how the Justice Department or consumer groups see it.
So whats behind Perrys different perspective?
Gee, perhaps it is the more than $500,000 that AT&Ts political action committee has given Perry over the past decade.
Watchdog groups accused Perry of engaging in pay-to-play politics, which sounds about right.
Romney? Same same but different.

“…..Instead, the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally should be required to register with the government, according to Romney.  “When we learn how many people there are and what their individual circumstances are, then we can decide how to proceed with each individual,”  Romney said…..”
Each individual?  Got a century?  Isn’t this what Moammar Obama is doing right now?  Romney has missionary relatives in Mexico going back decades.  Romney, like Rick Perry, cannot be trusted to delouse the country of illegals nor secure the border.  If we miss it this time around, it may all be over.

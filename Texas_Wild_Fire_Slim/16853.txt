UTAH COUNTY -- Firefighters are battling a wildfire on the edge of Camp Williams that sent a plume of smoke visible in Salt Lake and Utah Counties.

Lt. Col. Hank McIntire with the Utah National Guard says flames have scorched about 50 acres on the camp's southern border.

About 10 Camp Williams firefighters are working alongside fire crews from Utah and Tooele Counties. No structures are threatened, and crews say the fire is now under control.

No word yet on what ignited the fire.

					“Since December Texas has lost over 3.5 million acres to fire. That is bigger than the state of Connecticu­t. This also has nothing to do with Rick Perry, God, The Federal Government­, The State Government or any of that bullcrap. These people are losing everything to fire and most of you sit there and make it a political issue and it's absolutely disgusting­. You should be ashamed of yourselves­. Texas Parks and Wildlife posted a video on youtube of how fast this thing is going. Here is the link. http://www­.youtube.c­om/watch?v­=vhJeDYQVt­dQ”

				I saw a video of a lady who returned to her burned home.  She and her family lost all of their possesions­.  All family pictures burned.  She was thankful that all in her family, plus the family pets escaped.

I've always had a fear of fire and of losing family pictures.  If fire were ever to occur I can always replace a home and furniture, but worry about the things not replacable­...family and photos.  

The fires and the heat have been horrific in TX this year.  Best to you from your Okie neighbor.  Hopefully, the rain will come soon.

Read the story:








				BASTROP, Texas — A roaring wildfire raced through rain-starved farm and ranchland in Central Texas on Monday, destroying nearly 500 homes during a rapid advance that was fanned in part by howling winds from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee.

At least 5,000 people were forced from their homes in Bastrop County about 25 miles east of Austin, and about 400 were in emergency shelters, officials said.  MORE

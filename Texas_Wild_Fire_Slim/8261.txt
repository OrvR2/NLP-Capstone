THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Libya's remaining chemical weapon stockpiles are believed to be secure despite the turmoil that has roiled the country since February, the chief of a U.N. watchdog said Wednesday.Ahmet Uzumcu, director general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said his inspectors are ready to return to Libya to oversee the destruction of Moammar Gadhafi's poison gas supplies "when the conditions will allow us."The organization had inspectors in Libya up until February verifying the destruction process but left as the anti-Gadhafi rebellion gathered intensity.However, Uzumcu said Wednesday he had heard from sources that "remaining stockpiles of chemical weapons are secured." He did not identify the sources."Once the circumstances will permit, we hope the destruction (of the supplies) will resume," he said.In 2004, Gadhafi agreed to dismantle his weapons of mass destruction, and his regime underscored its commitment by using bulldozers to crush 3,300 unloaded aerial bombs that could have been used to deliver chemical weapons.Libya destroyed nearly 13.5 metric tons (15 tons) of sulfur mustard last year, about 54 percent of its stockpile. It received an extension to eliminate the rest by May 15, the organization said. Nearly 40 percent of the chemicals used to make sulfur mustard also have been destroyed since 2005, it said.Twice-yearly inspections have found no evidence of Libya reviving the chemical weapons program.Uzumcu spoke to reporters after meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari for an update on Baghdad's efforts to destroy Saddam Hussein-era chemical weapons.

Statements from these clowns, though apparently meant to reassure, only serve to make any intelligent person more nervous.

"UN watchdog says Libyan chemical weapons secure"...It's always reassuring knowing the UN has control of chemical weapons;)

Now that we helped the leader of the rebal group who is  Al-Qaeda  gain control in Libya and we are allies I suppose the chemical weapons will simply be handed over in a good Samaritan move on their part so we can all rest peacefully and the wars in Iraq and Afganistan are finally over.  LOL

If the chemical weapons are in the hands of NATO that pretty much means no one is secure, as NATO is looking more and more like a hit force for the european bankers, which will attack any and all countries which are not on board with there agenda, or in other words will not hand over there resources to the elites

Let me get this straight....Libya has had WMD's all these years and were on the terror watch list for sponsoring  terrorists and they nad we have not attacked them until now (Bush took them of the list and ended sanctions against them) not to mention we are not even there for the WMD how backwards is this.

Libya just had another revolution; just like the one that put Moammar in power in the first place.  Now they have no government, NOTHING there is secure.

The chief of a U.N. watchdog says Libya's remaining chemical weapon stockpiles are believed to be secure despite the turmoil that has roiled the country since February.
,, yet then says
he had heard from sources that "remaining stockpiles of chemical weapons are secured."
So no boots on the ground, no satalite survlance of the area, and the remaining stockpiles,, what about the entire stockpiles,, are you telling us in a backhanded way that the Arab spring so supported by the NATO alliance just handed over chemical weapons to Al-Quicantkillmysellfquickenoughada.. 
Is this how you assessed India and Pakistan nuclear capabilities,, pulled the oppinion out of your ass. please stop funding this POS UN and level that out of code fire danger to NY city.

This will serve as a lesson - destroy your weapons, get invaded.

Anybody else notice the last paragraph of the article? If the Duelfer report had concluded that Saddam Hussein had no chemical weapons or any remnants of a program, then why is there still an ongoing effort to destroy them? Fact of the matter is that there was in fact some remnants of WMDs and their programs. Which various UN Resolutions in the 90's strictly forbid Hussein from having ANY of. More smoke and mirrors.

al-qaeda assures the west it has safegaurded these chemical weapons.  no need for the U.N. to waste its valuable time  on such a trivial thing.  as peace loving muslims they shall insure they are used wisely.  

this is what happens when you have a questionable american who is pro muslim helping known radicals gain WMD's.  you idiots who supported and still support obama can take you "hope and change" and stick it up your (fucking) a$$.

NATO and it's allies need to find a GOD any GOD and start praying that the heathens don't begin shipping thier new found cure for infadelism all over the world. There is no doubt whatsoever that the rebels will have a secret supply of these wonderful toys stashed away before the UN gets back to work.

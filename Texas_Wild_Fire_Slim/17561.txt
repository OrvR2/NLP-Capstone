Ten years in the making…

Utterly forgettable.
That’s how I’d describe my first experiment with a Web presence.
A decade ago I put up a personal Web site as a graduate student, complete with cheesy personal pictures, obligatory links and a counter (which insultingly had six digits, only two of which ever budged). Of course I got very little feedback, and what I did receive consisted mostly of Texas A&M Aggies who were angry with me for linking to the 1995 Texas Longhorn football schedule.
A decade later I’m ready to give it another go, with hopefully better results. At least I have a purpose this time. I’m aiming to provide a forum for discussing science — everything from archaeology to nanotechnology — and basic medical research, including areas such as genetics.
I’ll also be talking about obesity, because I think it’s a fascinating lens for looking at our culture, science and how statistics can be used and abused.
What I’m most excited about is interacting with you. You’re definitely going to get your chance to participate. I want comments and plan to jump into debates that come up here.
So let’s start talking about science. I want to hear what you think is interesting, what excites you, and the trends in science and research that deserve more coverage.
This blog will have a Houston slant, because there’s a lot of great research being done here and in Texas, but national and international stuff is welcome, too.
Before I wrap this up I want to share one thing about the unpredictability of the Internet. Working with it is a constant learning process, which this blogging experiment is sure to be as well.
About 10 days ago I wrote a story on the impact of natural subsidence — as opposed to groundwater and oil pumping-induced subsidence — that got picked up by the Drudge Report. As has happened in the past, this resulted in a deluge of e-mail. In this case, nearly 100. The funny thing is that about half were from people complaining (in some cases, very rudely) that a source of mine had said the Colorado River flows into the Gulf of Mexico.
“How should we believe your story,” many wrote (some also added that I was a moron) “when everyone knows the mighty Colorado River flows into the Pacific Ocean?”
Most of my readership is from Texas, so I hadn’t qualified the fact that my source was referring to the smaller Colorado River that runs through Austin, familiar to Texans, not the one that carved the Grand Canyon.
Lesson learned. The Web does interesting things to communication. So let’s see what we can do with it.

Outgeeked!
A new blogger joins us today, and he’s one-upped me in the geek department. Eric Berger, our science writer, is our SciGuy. I thought I was the Chronicle’s “alpha geek” until I saw his watch. Eric’s got a watch that…

ADULT stem cell research.  So many exciting things are happening with ADULT SCR — it would be nice to see some stories/discussion of that topic, instead of this obsessive focus on embryonic SCR that has yielded nothing so far, except a whole lot of media attention.

Here is a neat little article on weld fabrication research for use in space environments.

I’m looking forward to your new web site. Might even be able to suggest some links for you. I am quite interested in serious science (although I no longer have the serious math). I’m somewhere between Art Bell and James Randi philosophically. I’ve personally witnessed some strange things (and I am a trained, objective, and somewhat skeptic observer), but I demand proof – or at least a reasonable explanation.

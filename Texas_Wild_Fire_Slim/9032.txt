i'd like to know why this is # 1 again on yahoo. so what, she was gracious in accepting it. the person never would have known she didn't like it. is madonna needing attention like jim carrey and charlie sheen? if not, what's the big deal?

Still rocking that British accent? Why is it Brits can come to America for years and not lose their accents, but Americans go to England and start talking like the queen within two months.

What really matters at this point is to be kind and not EGOCENTRIC.
   Lets say that Kabbalah tools still have a lot to do in order to transform that inner......

She didn't diss his gift, she accepted it graciously.  Afterward she whispered that she loathes that type of flower.  OMG this is stupid and so is anyone who thinks she was rude to the fan.  This article is rude however, not only does it publish a private aside, but now the fan knows she didnt like the flower.  :P

Clearly she's a self-centred bitch who's lost touch with even the simplest kind gestures - but what I really would like to know is why the hell she has a British accent when she speaks? She's from the US!

StoryText Size5 Signs You Might Be Addicted To FacebookHeed The Warnings Of Facebook AddictionAmanda Keim, Staff writer Thierry Roge/Reuters
Facebook has made it easy to keep up with old friends and let folks know what's going on in your world. In some cases, that second part comes a little too easily.While Facebook is a great way to share big news or plan events, a lot of the minutiae of our lives is better kept private -- just because you can press that "share" button doesn't mean you should disclose every little detail of your day.Your friends may love you, but seeing every excruciating detail of your weekend fridge-cleaning adventures in their newsfeeds is a bit much.If you can't keep that impulse in check, it may be time to put down your mobile phone and step away from the Facebook account. After all, admitting you have a problem is the first step toward recovery.

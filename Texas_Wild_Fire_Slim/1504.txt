Monique Exum, a 36-year old woman in the Bronx, has claimed responsibility to stuffing her dead roommate's body into a suitcase and then leaving it outside an abandoned home, according to The Daily News. 
The body of John Davis, Exum's 74-year old roommate, was found on Sunday, after a 911 call reported a suspicious suitcase outside 1309 Needham Avenue in the Williamsbridge neighborhood in the Bronx. 
However, Exum admits no wrongdoing to Sunday's disturbing discovery and it claims she acted on fear.
"My friend told me if someone dies in your apartment you go to jail, so I got really afraid,' Exum said to police. "I didn't know what to do."
Exum is being held on a $500 bond and was charged with improper body removal. Davis's cause of death has yet to be determined.

				She moved into an apartment with an old guy. She thought it would be cheaper and that she wouldn't have to worry about him hitting on her or bothering her and her friends. It was a great arrangemen­t. He would watch T.Vall day and he didn't intrude! THEN he died! She was afraid she would have to find a different room mate! SOLUTION: Put him in suitcase..­... Ok.... I am still not seeing the logic of the scenerio..­..... Still sounds really stupid!

				This a perennial and mortal question, what to do with a body, complicate­d by issues of law and accountabi­lity in the eyes of the state - when nobody cares, when people tell you to be afraid, when you're too scared to ask for help, even when it’s offered.  It’s possible that this New York death transcends right and wrong.

				Sounds Like she is an Immigrant and maybe the country she comes from, the Police are Not the One's to be calling and Maybe? Life is treated alot differentl­y there as well.
I'm sure they will get to the bottom of it..
Maybe he died of a heart attack after having sex with her?

                    Pay to performance?  Fine.  Make it retroactive, and pay the American worker back for 30 years of increased productivity and stagnant wages.

                    In item manufacturing and any business that depends on hand labor, "pay to performance" is code for piece-work and sweatshops. It values quantity over quality. In a business where worker performance depends on some level of cognitive skills, pay to performance can have untoward effects.

In the 1990s Bell Atlantic implemented pay for performance at its call centers. Information operators were expected to handle X number of calls per hour. I can remember trying to get a phone number from the call center and getting three wrong numbers in a row by harried call center operators. And, of course, I was billed when I reached each of the wrong numbers as well as for the three calls to the call center, not to mention the 4th call when I finally got the correct number.

                    I agree. 

P4P also seems like code for employers cutting even more heads, and putting more work on fewer shoulders to maximize profit. And if someone within the company doesn't like it, they can always quit and replace that person within 24 hours.

                    Exactly.  I have a friend who actually works at a call center and has been formally warned (read threatened) with everything up to being fired for not getting through enough calls per hour regardless of what the individual situation of each one of those callers was.

"Pay to performance? Fine. Make it retroactive, and pay the American worker back for 30 years of increased productivity and stagnant wages."


And while we're at it, let's also have Pay to Societal Importance.

Pay people proportionally commensurate with their function in and service to society:  thus, teachers, firefighters, and police would get millions a year -- and Bolling and the other Fox News idiots would get a dollar a day plus bread and water . . .

                    {Images being blocked. Re-try of blocked post}
Example of W-P gap graph being presented lately.
Beware: Others show little or no gap. They are either selective (e.g. from the Heritage Fndn 2004 for Mfg sector to 2002) or span from 1947 but indexed to 1992 and going only to 1997. With cherry picking and creative indexing the gap can be masked.

                    Ironically, the Heritage Fndn graph may support unionization (vis-a-vis the W-P gap) given the relatively higher incidence of unionization in that sector (at least prior to 2006).

                    What he is really saying is that we don't need large blocks of organized voters that that support Democrats. Thats the real reason behind the anti union push from the right.

                    It's more about not allowing workers to successfully push back against the wealthy who own the businesses. Organized unions bargain for such "luxuries" as safe working conditions, paid vacations, 40 hour workweek and healthcare benefits. All of these things cost the owners money. 

The costs can be avoided by sending the jobs overseas where workers make few demands on safety or an eight hour work day.

Freshman Tea Party-backed Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) recently argued that federal child labor laws go beyond the bounds of the Constitution. At first I thought he was hinting that we should allow children to work in factories. A more charitable but no less mendacious motive is the newfangled "state's rights" meme that is gaining favor with the TeaBoners.

                    Not a chance of a bet, Kevin.  If the camera men weren't in a union, they wouldn't be working in New York City.

That's why I can't understand the union bashing that goes on on Faux News.  If it wasn't for union members, they wouldn't be on the air.

                    This doesn't mean nothing as the Unions are on the way out anyway mostly due to their greed.  As states default and companies fail, so will the Unions.  You can squeeze blood from a turnip and the days of Obama Union bailout gifts are coming to a close contract or not.

Union Pacific Reports Record Quarterly Earnings

Kroger Reports Earnings of 41 Cents Per Share

Exxon Mobil Earnings Nearly Double

Walt Disney Co. third-quarter earnings jump 40%

Southwest Airlines posts $11 million profit in quarter

What do all of these companies have in common?  Significant unionization of their payroll.

                    And how many trillions of dollars are owed to state union pension funds?  You do understand that underfunded means there's no money to pay pensions?

Humpty Dumpty is just about to fall, but hopefully Congress will enact a law to allow states to file bankruptcy as bailouts are done.

                    So you're advocating for the states to renege on a contract?

I bet if you were due a pension you'd think differently.  But since you're probably not, you simploy don't care about your fellow citizens.  How un-American of you.

                    Well lets see, if you can't pay a contract (car, house, credit card) what are YOUR options?  I guess you could try to cut back on your day to day expenses to generate cash.

The states can do this too, which they would need to cut out billions & billions of dollars of entitlements for all the medical care, wellfare, unemployment, road improvements, etc.

Of course many, many people of the state will suffer, but at least those hard working union memebers will still get their pensions.  Sounds like a plan to me, sufferage of the many for beneift of the few.

                    The states often did not pay into the pension funds as they were supposed to. Many workers gave up higher pay to have decent benefits because we saw how the private sector companies were destroying their workers' retirements with the ponzi scheme of the 401K retirement.

Or, they could (gasp!!!!) raise taxes a little like Illinois just did.  And if you raise them on the wealth7y, then you will have sufferage of the few for the benefit of the many.

Problem solved.  Right, akmikeus?

                    Ha Ha Ha, now that is the funniest thing I've heard all day.  This isn't John Stewart is it?  

We're talking billions & billions of dollars John.  Get a calculator and figure out how many billions (trillions?) of dollars one state would have to tax to raise say $150B.  I'll let you pick the tax rate and be sure to check out how many billionares % millionares you would need to tax.

Now to help you out even more, go to this website www.usdebtclock.org/ and this will help you to calculate things like actual available tax payers and actual available income to tax.  

One word of caution, if you're prone to panic attacks, you may not want to view this website as it's the scariest webpage known to any sane American.

                    Read up on how much debt Illinois (one of the most populous states) was facing and how much they raised taxes and then get back to us.

Reading up on current events would help you make your arguments.

                    I will and it's great that Illinois has solved all there debt problems with a tax increase.  

Psst. maybe we should tell the other broke states to increase their taxes?

I like your plan only because I pay state taxes in a state with a surplus.

                    My job will never be cut as I'm a specialist in the oil & gas drilling business. Also, my specialty is required world wide so even if I were to lose my job in the US, then I could take my much needed talents to Europe, Asia, Canada, Middle East, Australia, etc, etc.

I love my non Union job.

                    SMUG "IT COULD NEVER HAPPEN TO ME" TROLL ALERT!

I can't be the only one where who was waiting for this post.  It's pretty much required of all "I'm doing great, what's wrong with you losers, don't ask me to contribute to society" Horatio Alger jokers who post here.

How many versions of the same "my job is untouchable, I'm awesome, I make big money and I will never, ever, EVER get laid off or fired unlike you losers" post have we seen at this site over the years? Well over a hundred.

Seriously, is there a web site that sells these scripts, you pompous, phony blowhard?

Now tell me I'm jealous.  That's required, too- or you'll be in violation of the contract you agreed to when you bought the script.

                    If it wasn't for you greedy oil and gas drilling specialists, maybe it wouldn't cost me $50 to fill my gas tank.  I feel entitled to all the cheap fuel I want.  I expect you to work for dirt wages, no pension, no 401K, just so I can hang on to my hard earned money.  When you become too old to make a living, well, that's your problem, you deal with it.  Eat cat food, live in a cardboard box, whatever.  Just don't expect anything from me. 

It is all about me, after all.

                    Whoa, fill your gas tank? I thought everybody blogging here rode bikes or roller bladed in they're effort to halt Global Warming?

And if you want cheap fuel, then start demanding that the oil companies start drilling off the West & East coasts and ANWR. Open up America and your fuel prices will drop.

                    God, you are a really simple-minded idiot. Opening the coasts and ANWR would do nothing to curb the oil prices in the U.S because that oil would be sold in the international market by the private companies that are drilling it. That, of course, without counting the damages it could do to the local economies and enviroment (The area of ANWR where drilling is being considered is the spawning place for many of the local wildlife).

Yep, that's all you need to bring your total number of thoughts to One.

I'm just wondering- why should Unions which have a contract with the state to fund pensions have to "raise Union dues so they can pay for their own pensions?"  Why do contracts mean nothing if a Union is involved?  What happened to responsibility?

But please, let someone else answer.  I don't want to tax your "thought" process.  And I can't imagine any reply from you being at all constructive.  Amusing, perhaps, but not constructive.

                    They have been increased and the obligation is on the state.  The states will pay and bankruptcy won't be an option.  A clown troll like yourself wouldn't know that.

                    So Union members paid for their pensions, the states didn't take care of the money and Wall Street lost all of it also?

Wow, I guess it sucks to be in a Union? Glad I have a private corporation pension fund and a 401k working for me.

Of course mine is probably much smaller than a Union pension, but at least I'll get my pension.

                    Really? The right is to blame again? Come on people, take credit where credit is due. I'm sure Oblerman is drumming up some kind of story to blame this on the Teaparty even though the Teaparty was the one attacked.

Now, as long as the economy doesn't tank again and kill your 401k, and your company doesn't decide to restructure under bankruptcy laws and hand your underfunded pension over to the tax payers to pay, you will be just fine.

                    I'm more worried about the Gov't confiscating my 401k than the company filing bankruptcy. As for my 401k, it's snuggled away as I've learned my lesson in 2009 after the Barney Frank/Chris Dodd created mortgage financial collapse.

                    If you 'think' that Barney Frank and Chris Dodd created the "mortgage financial collapse", then you've learned less than nothing from the experience. You have zero comprehension of what really went down, but have simply and naively accepted the dishonest, scapegoating narrative laid down by the corporate grifters who actually made off with our money. 

unfortunately, gullible corporate lackey that you clearly are, you're likely to blame the Democrats and the progressives when you get swindled out of your retirement funds once again.

                    You don't have to worry about the govt. taking your 401k.  The capitalists on Wall Street will steal it for you.

Be even more glad that 401K isn't being operated by Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers -- or it would have evaporated on Sept. 29, 2008 . . .

                    It's quite clear that to right-wingers, contracts are sacred- unless the contract is between states and unionized workers.  

Then contracts MUST be re-negotiated, or better yet, torn up altogether, because hey, gotta face "realities," right?

Meanwhile, a "temporary" tax cut for the rich MUST be renewed OMIGOD it absolutely MUST, becaue failing to extend it would be a BETRAYAL!!  Never mind realities, keep your hands off my upper class tax cut!!

                    So in Obama's own words, "the tax cuts on the rich will cost the Gov't $700B over ten years".

News flash, the states owe TRILLIONS in underfunded pension debt. $700B would be a drop in the bucket, nice try.

                    One reference, one source, just one please, showing that the reason for underfunding of state union pension funds is the fault of the unions. {All I can find are the responsibility of state pension boards, not the unions.) If you can find none, in what possible sense is the underfunding "due to their greed"?

But who knows, maybe the state pension fairy will give the states the trillions of dollars they need so nobody suffers and then poop rainbows as he or she flys away.

Tell me something, how low do US children score in International testing vs. the rest of the world?

At the end of the day, the taxpayer has thrown billions & billions of dollars to our school systems and the kids now are no better off or smarter than our Grandparent were and yes, many of them were home school by parents with no tenure.

                    There's this really cool thing called using an "s" to indicate "Plural."  Also, "ed" can be used- or did you really mean that your Grandparent was a building which served as a home and a school?  A building apparently built by parents who didn't have tenure (I didn't know there was such a thing as giving parents tenure- how long do they have to be parents before that kicks in, anyway?)

Oh let me guess- you're a bad "typist," right?

Well, hell -- NO WONDER the freshman teabagger Senator Mike Lee, as einreb pointed out upthread, is suggesting that child labor laws are unconstitutional.

Why should kids waste time in school possibly learning, when they could working a {non-union} job in the factories/sweatshops, right?

Read this, and get back to us.

Full disclosure, I volunteer daily at a local JrH. I haven't met any bad teachers there. The talk centers on their lives and work. Not how they can use their union to become richer and always having a secure position while working less.

No.  It's because they're UNIONIZED.  And since they're educated, more likely to vote democratic.

                    It's because educators teach kids how to THINK. Thinking people are more difficult to control because they use reasoning skills to separate truth from B.S. without being told which is which. They will choose a Barack Obama message over a Glenn Beck message every time.

This is unacceptable to the fascist mind set. Thinking also thins the trOll herd considerably.

I understand your fears though, 2012 is rapidly approaching and the progressive dream is fading faster than you can bear.  No worries though as you'll probably get another shot in oh I don't know, 100 years?

You had your chance, but Obama has failed you and for that, what did you really expect from a community organizer. I guess he fooled all of you with the blather that was "Dreams of my Father".

Well, unless you can come up with someone other than Sarah "half-term" Palin or Willard "the dog whisperer" Romney, Obama will retain the WH in a landslide . . .

"You had your chance, but Obama has failed you and for that, what did you really expect from a community organizer." -- ackmuckus

ROFL -- gotta love how the same wingnuts who scream "only HISTORY can judge Bush" {who's been out of office two years} can turn around and pronounce Obama a "failure" while IN office.

As for what I expected from a "community organizer", I got.  Which is a lot more than I got from the failed Texas businessman/fake rancher/C student/Texas ANG deserter . . .

                    There is no question that unions abused their power, but it is ankle high compared to the excesses racked up by greedy owners who forced workers to toil in abysmal working conditions. Akmikeus, you never worked in a steel mill or even visited a coal mine or you wouldn't have posted such an ignorant statement. 

Trolls come to this site armed only with talking points but no first hand experience. Their lack of knowledge is transparent as glass yet they become highly offended when called on it.

                    I'm sorry, you're right; I've never worked in a coal mine or a steel mill. I have been blessed to find a career in the oil & gas drilling business, which I realize is right there in line with florists for job safety. I've spent 30yrs working in Prudhoe Bay and have seen -60deg ambient temp and worked through many a days with -100deg windchills.

I have worked on rigs in the Gulf of Mexico (yes deepwater & shelf) and have spent time on Chinese offshore rigs and Chinese land rigs in West China.  All this and I’ve not had any Union dues to pay to greedy Union bosses who then tell me how to vote.

No go back to your cooled and heated classrooms and pray for your pensions as only God can help you now. Broke is broke.

                    Maybe with a decent union you would have been spared some of that extreme exposure. That's the whole point of a union. That's the whole point of this thread. Unions serve a useful purpose. Fox is lying. 

And union bosses don't tell you how to vote. You never belonged to a union, but you heard that word of mouth instead of learning it, right?

I have a lot of respect for rugged individuals. I have less respect for individuals who were forced to become rugged only because they don't learn.

And of course they used heated space shuttles to move us around outside when walking or tending to the rig?

Winter Drilling Rig
Please note that the drilling area around the turntable is enclosed. Again, you (or anyone else) does not work outside in -100 wind chill on a drill rig. 
But; your obvious manliness has really impressed me.

                    Turntable? Did you Google or Bing this? So you believe that if the windchill is -100deg, that an uninsulated one-eight inch thick steel walls will keep it toasty on the inside?

Oh mu bad, you probably also believe in Global Warming so -100deg is causing it too.

Get a grip and trust me, many a man has worked in these conditions to provide a better life for his family.

                    I never intimated that I was a (what was that term) "rig pig". I know people in the oil drilling business but all of them worked the fields in Texas.
 Nobody ever said it isn't cold in Alaska in the winter and working a drill rig is hard work in any weather but; you aren't working in -100 wind chill. You are probably still freezing your butt off but; it isn't the same as standing unprotected in -60 temps with a 20 mph breeze blowing. Any exposed skin will develop frostbite in less than 5 minutes at those temps. That is why they enclose the rig. You know that as well as I do, if you work a rig. 

BTW if you are 55 what the heck are you doing working a rig in Alaska?

                    I'm not, I'm in North Dakota and since I live in the US, I have to work until I'm 59 and a half until I get my money without penalty.

Of course if I would of worked for a Union, I could have retired at 50, but of course now I would have to wonder who or what is going to keep paying my excessive benefits.

                    You apparently don't understand what the term "wind chill" means.  Give ya a hint, faker:  wind chill only effects warm blooded animals.  A steel box would only be lowered to the ambient temperature.  Geez, you dork.  Try a little research before you post your lies.

                    Average union boss salary is in the low six figures.  Somehow to a Republican, THAT IS GREED.  WOW!!  Somehow that drains the coffers of money from pensions that workers should benefit from and somehow ten figure bonuses to individual executives (who decide their own pay) somehow DO NOT hurt the company and its employees.

And they tell you how to VOTE!! Something corporations and corproate heads would NEVER EVER EVER DO.  Right?

You don't need unions, Bolling, but people who work for a living still do.

                    Bolling is an imbecile if he doesn't understand that the elimination of Unions will bring back unsafe work places,child labor,substandard wages,and all the other garbage that comes with unfettered Capitalism.Where do they find these idiots?

                    Reagan re-opened the war on unions. It took the former head of the Screen Actor's Guild, a union, to declare that they were a danger to the country. 

And that started the demise of the middle class in the U.S.A.

Democrats used to be the labor party in this country. Hard to find a pro-labor Democrat anymore. And now we have the governor of NJ ginning up support for reneging on union contracts while he gives bigger tax breaks to the wealthiest in the state. He gets patted on the back for "making tough choices".

Meanwhile, Illinois is raising taxes to close their budget gap. Who is making the tough choices? NJ or Illinois? I vote for Illinois.

                    Pay for performance?  The executives of my company took it from record profits to bankruptcy in five quarters.  About 42 executives were paid over $400 million.  The folks who took direct responsibility for tens of thousands of lives and billions of dollars of equipment that carried the sorry likes of these dilettantes took pay cuts, lost jobs and pensions.  This is the reward for years of education, going to work, taking responsibility, paying taxes, supporting a war effort, and playing by the rules.  Capitalism is suppose to reward the productive.  No money can be made without productivity.  The American worker has increased productivity steadily.  The American worker has been subjected to deferred compensation, (pensions) eliminated and dumped on the taxpayer, by those that preach small government.  These small government capitalists also accept tax breaks and outright subsidies.  Capitalism is about rewarding those that are productive.  That is the driving engine of capitalism.  Plutocracy is being ruled by the rich, lords and servants.  We had a revolution a couple of hundred years ago to stop this.  Read Alexander Hamilton's views on the American economy, and compare to our lords and masters. Look at Mariner Eccles, whose name is on the Federal reserve.   If unions are communist, how many unions are there in China, or were in the former Soviet Bloc?  If unions are corrupt, how come of the four pensions my father in law earned, the only one received was from the "corrupt Teamsters Union pension fund"?

                    They always need to add the "any more" to this talking point.

Fox is at least aware enough that their older audience has to include many former union members, so they can't slam unions outright as never having a purpose.

I first noticed this a few years ago, at this site, when the subject of unions came up. Every wingnut comment began with some version of " There was a time when unions were needed, but it's different now...".

They never really explained why that was. The wealth gap increasing, wages stagnating as unions were targeted for elimination, all the facts point in the opposite direction.

                    What a crock!! We need unions now more than ever. The union of CEO's and Wall Street have decimated the US Workforce since Ronnie Raygun became president. If the middle class is survive, unions are needed.

                    Exactly. "The rich" have decided American middle class is obsolete. They have used Republicans to help sell out American jobs to the lowest bidders. Republicans have never seen a free trade agreement they didn't like. 

Here are some statistics. I love to provide statistics because they give trolls the dreaded "turtle dick" and makes them cry.

The United States has lost approximately 42,400 factories since 2001

Dell Inc. has announced plans to dramatically expand its operations in China with an investment of over $100 billion over the next decade.

In 2008, 1.2 billion cellphones were sold worldwide. So how many of them were manufactured inside the United States? Zero.

If our trade deficit with China increases at its current rate, the U.S. economy will lose over half a million jobs this year alone.

The United States has lost a total of about 5.5 million manufacturing jobs since October 2000.

From 1999 to 2008, employment at the foreign affiliates of US parent companies increased an astounding 30 percent to 10.1 million

The United States has lost 32 percent of its manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.

                    Blame it on the rich, blame it on Bush, blame it on the rain, but never and I mean never ever blame it on the Federal Gov't, which has become a monstrosity of over regulation.  This over regulation has killed jobs, innovation and is bankrupting America.  

Must… keep… feeding… the beast as the Fed only has our best interest at heart.

                    Grover Norquist wants to shrink government until it's small enough to drown in a bathtub. Cute as the phrase is, the dummy can't come up with a better idea. 

Under Bush, FEMA was gutted. Look what happened in the aftermath of Katrina.

Under Bush, the EPA was gutted. Our air quality declined.

Under Bush, banks were deregulated. Look what happened to the housing market and Wall Street.

I could go on to fill two pages, but you get the idea.

Regulation doesn't mean big government, it means strict rules. If big business had its way, every square inch of America would be mined for its natural resources, we'd have even dirtier water, no national parks, endless parking lots and half empty shopping malls as far as the eye can see.

                    Still blaming Wall Street for the housing market?  

Are you sure it wasn't Barney Frank's and Chris Dodd's policy who felt that every American deserved the right to own a home no matter the credit risk?  Come on now, be truthful. I knew there was something up when my sister who was married to an illegal alien, were approved for a home loan in Nevada.  Are you kidding me, their family couldn't afford a one bedroom apartment, but some how through Gov't backed loans as directed by Frank & Todd, they were the proud owners of a three bedroom house.

So home prices continued to rise on this false bubble and then BAM!  Foreclosures are rampant and the bubble bursts and well, you know the rest of the story.

Oh yeah, their back in the one bedroom apartment.

Thanks again to Frank & Todd for crashing the housing market.

                    Its foolish beyond stupidity to try to point the finger of blame on any one single party for the failure of the housing market.

Also, to suggest that is was Frank's and Dodd's policy, "that every American deserved the right to own a home no matter the credit risk," is just patently false.

I also noiced that you failed to mention that these high risk loans, that banks were gladly taking in by the way, were being bundled and sold to foreign investors and other duped parties.

Look, I understand that there are some very significant problems that we have to discuss about the future of our country.  But, to suggest that one side is free and clear of any blame or fault (private industry, conservatives/republicans, or whatever your argument is), while the other side is to blame for everything (Democrats, progressives, public programs and institutions) serves neither one of us in a debate.

Having read over your posts in this thread, I believe it is clear that you have a deep deep mistrust of the government.  I however do not.  I respect the institutions of my government, I believe that they have made us the strongest and most powerful country on the planet, and while I agree that changes must take place, I am not prepared to throw the baby out with the bath water as much as you seem to want to.

                    No my friend, do you really think the banking industry is that stupid or was the banking industry "nudged" by Congress (Frank & Dodd) to come up with a financing  method to provide home loans to risky buyers?  

Do you deny that banks were told that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae will guarantee all these risky loans?  So if you can deny all these statements, why have Freddie & Fannie cost the taxpayers hundreds of BILLIONS of dollars?  Why is it that their stocked was pulled off the market last year? 

My Lord, I thought the people on this website were highly educated, but I guess I was misinformed as much as they are concerning the events of America.

                    If you ignore history: In 2005 the House passed (331 to 90) the Federal Finance Reform Act. BF was a signatory. The Act would have created a stronger regulator with the power to increase capital at Fannie & Freddie, it would have limited their portfolios and dealt with the possibility of receivership. The bill was not supported in the Senate and the Bush Admin attacked the bill. So much for BF as boogieman. {According to former Republican Congressman from Ohio, Mike Oxley, at the time head of the House Financial Services Committee}
Your personal story also ignores the role of unscrupulous mortgage brokers, beasts of The Street and it's 30:1 leveraging, not Frank & Dodd.

Wall Street.

Nope, shouldn't blame Wall Street and the banks for the mortgage crisis.  We gotta blame the poor people.

Oh yeah, their back in the one bedroom apartment

Again, why do the nutjobs have such a problem with "their" vs. "they're"?

However, there are different levels depending on your performance over the year.  I see it as a win / win for me.  We use our collective power to agree on what the bands should be but then it's up to me to prove where I should be in those bands.

                    You know, I want to give a shout-out to the self-proclaimed "Greatest Generation."  These are people who lived through the Great Depression, who saw the horrific struggles that psychotically abused working men went through to win the 8-hour work week, overtime pay, retirement, breaks, and all the other essential worker-employer relation components that we all enjoy and take for granted today.  But they're willing, now that they no longer have to work for a living, to throw their kids, grandkids, and great grandkids, who are now supporting their Social Security and Medicare benefits, right the hell under the bus.  Thanks a lot, grandma and grandpa, because you vote Republican, I have to scramble twice as hard as you did for less money.  Because you're easily scared by hyperbole and lies, I have no retirement security to look forward to when I reach your age.  Because of your reactionary and ill-informed opinions, I have to shoulder most of the national debt so that millionaires and billionaires, who were once the very bane of your youthful existence, can have a better jet, another home in the Hamptons, and a tax free legacy for their greedy, grasping brood.  Thanks a lot.

Bolling: "We Don't Need Unions Anymore"

Fox just needs to admit it already.

They desire an America where the middle class is no longer.  An America where the rich rule once again, stamping the poor and working class into the dirt and mud.  After all, to the Reich Wing, it's what the poor deserve, right?

I was a former Republican.

I don't recognize the GOP anymore.

                    AMEN! The teachers unions are THE REASON we have failing public schools. Fire the bad teachers. Merit pay. Vouchers. All of these ideas will work, and DO WORK in Europe (don't you liberals love Europe?)... so ENOUGH with the glorification of the incompetent teacher who makes an average of $60,000 a year and has tenure after 2 years (in my home state)

                    I'm not a total fan of the teachers' unions.  However, I think you might change your tune if you had to be a teacher in a school in this country.  They aren't the ones to pile on, IMO.  Considering what they have to deal with every day, I'd say they're grossly underpaid.

Indeed.

They already tried to educate rtownsend, and you see what happened . . . :)

                    You really don't want vouchers. Vouchers are the "Bettlejuice" of public education.

Vouchers = privatization = uncertified adults teaching + government interference with where the vouchers are spent.

                    All teachers are incompetent?  That's a stretch.  And since we're on the subject, how many other professions require a Masters Degree and yet only pay a national average of around $50,000/year?  That's a pretty low wage for six years of school, don't you think?  Maybe we should increase their pay.  I mean, don't you wingnuts love the free market?  Hike teacher salaries to six figures, and watch the talented people who are really busy crashing our economy on Wall Street come flocking to the calling of educating our nation's young people.

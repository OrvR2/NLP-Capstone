WHAT

AN ECOSYSTEM SERVICE IS

Learn what an ecosystem service is and what that means to you
Forests and trees help provide many services that have traditionally been perceived as free. Known as ecosystem services, they are assets such as clean air, pure water, biodiversity, protection from flooding, regulation of the climate, and the creation of scenic landscapes.
Ecosystem services define and establish an economic value to the assets that nature provides in performing critical services such as carbon storage, water protection, climate stabilization, erosion prevention and providing quality of life infrastructure in our communities.
A market-based approach to conservation with private enterprise and government could provide additional incentives for landowners to protect and enhance their property. A landowner with qualifying natural resources on his property may be financially compensated for the services that the natural resources provide.
Some of the many challenges of this emerging market are the lack of consistent public policy, a standard means of measuring performance and the obscurity of tangible financial returns.  Public policy, scientific and economic foundations of the emerging market-based trading of ecosystem services are still to be determined.
For more information about market-based trading of ecosystem services and to read a few examples of successful case studies, please explore the following links.

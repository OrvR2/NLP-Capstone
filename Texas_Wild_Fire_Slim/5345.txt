Astronauts' tracks, trash seen in new moon photosBy SETH BORENSTEIN - AP Science Writer | AP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011
REUTERS - NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) image released on September 6, 2011 shows the Apollo 17 site on the moon, where the tracks laid down by the lunar rover are clearly visible, along with the …more  last foot trails left on the moon. The images also show where the astronauts placed some of the scientific instruments that provided the first insight into the moon's environment and interior. LRO captured the sharpest images ever taken from space of the Apollo 12, 14 and 17 landing sites. Images show the twists and turns of the paths made when the astronauts explored the lunar surface. NASA says the image brightness and contrast have been altered to highlight surface details.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A spacecraft circling the moon has snapped the sharpest photos ever of the tracks and trash left behind by Apollo astronauts in their visits from 1969 to 1972.Images taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter from 13 to 15 miles up show the astronauts' paths when they walked on the moon, as well as ruts left by a moon buggy. Experts could even identify the backpacks astronauts pitched out of their lunar landers before they returned to Earth."What we're seeing is a trail," said Arizona State University geology professor Mark Robinson, the orbiter's chief scientist. "It's totally awesome."However, the photos were not close enough to see individual bootprints, Robinson said.The pictures were taken two weeks ago and show the landing sites for Apollo 12, 14 and 17. The closest images are of the 1972 Apollo 17 site, the last moon mission.Apollo 17 Commander Eugene Cernan wrote in an email to The Associated Press that the photo gives him a chance to revisit those days, "this time with a little nostalgia and disappointment. Nostalgia because those special days are fondly etched in my memory and disappointment because it looks like now we will not be going back within the days I have left on this planet."Two years ago, images from the same spacecraft from 30 and 60 miles out showed fuzzier images. But this year the orbiter dipped down to take about 300,000 more close-ups. The trails left by the astronauts are clear, but the places where backpacks were discarded, Apollo 17's moon buggy, and the bottom parts of the three lunar landers are blurry."You have to really look at it for a long time to figure out what you're looking at," Robinson said. For example, when it comes to the moon buggy he said, "if you squint really hard you can resolve the wheels and that the wheels are slightly turned to the left."At first, scientists thought they had a bit of a mystery: They saw more stuff than they expected. It turned out to be packing material and an insulation blanket, Robinson said.After 40 years there does not seem to be much moon dust covering the manmade trails. It probably will take about 10 million to 100 million years for dust to cover them, Robinson said.The photos were released a few days after the debut of the new fictional movie "Apollo 18" and before Thursday's planned launch of NASA's twin robotic spaceships to explore the moon's gravity.___Online:NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter: http://1.usa.gov/qTrKRwArizona State University Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera page:http://www.lroc.asu.edu/

What clarity. I can read every word of the text.

All this story needs now is the actual, you know... pictures.

Did they or didn't they??   Maybe after some good photo's, we'll be able to put to bed, if there was a moon landing......one way or another.

One day all that "trash" will be studied to see how things deteriorate on the Lunar surface.

We brought back parts of Ranger 9 for the same study. It was a short walk for the LEM.

I'm glad Buzz Aldrin smacked that lunar conspirator in the nose.  This should finally shut the nut jobs up though. NASA should be given an unlimited budget. Take it from welfare entitlement programs.

Really Yahoo, no slide show to see more of those pictures? C'mon, you guys are better than this. If you want to be my primary news source, give me enough to keep me interested. Maybe even a link to another site that has more pictures would be nice. Guess I'll have to go to NatGeo if I want more.

Sure, this'll definitely silence the conspiracy theorists...'cause it's so much harder to photoshop some fuzzy black and white photographs than it is to fake a series of Saturn V launches to LEO, and fake live video from the surface of the moon...

Hey, NASA, clean up your trash, you bastardfaces!

See NASA knew there would be some really smart people who would see through their conspiracy. So, they landed the shuttles on the moon to plant tracks and trash. That way the REALLY smart people would look like babbling retards and the faked landings would be safe from scrutiny by the REALLY smart people.

Terrell Owens is in tears over some financial issues By      MJD


Tuesday night, we shared the story of Terrell Owens advising DeSean Jackson to sit out until the Eagles give him more money. Springing forth Wednesday is this video that shows that T.O.'s "get all the money you can" message could be grounded in some personal issues he's facing.
 
The T.O. Show 3 - TV Shows - Full Episode Video - Reality TV Shows
Here's a snippet of T.O. explaining his problems.
"Football season is on a standstill, so I have no income at this point. None. On top of that, you're talking about the mortgage of all the real estate that I do have. And on top of that, child support."
I'm not a financial expert or a TV producer, but shouldn't VH1 be giving you a little bit of money for doing that television show? You're not crying on television for free, are you? If you're going to be exploited, make sure there's at least a check coming.
Best of luck to the guy.

0 users disliked this comment N.O is HOME 3 minutes ago Report Abuse This is what we warn future athletes about when they make it big. When you get hurt and your not making any money. You need investments and a college education to fall back on when things go sour. So basically its his own fault for not having his fianances in order. Its to late to cry over spoiled milk.

0 users disliked this comment joespa 3 minutes ago Report Abuse poor little rich man its sad to see another person of color loose it all because of poor financial planning. Those of us who dont have that kind of money or travel in those circles can easily say what we would do if we had that money. but most people dont know how to handle vast sums of money. What he needed was a posse that included himself with common sense an attorney he could trust an accountant he could trust    and an over seas bank acct to funnel money into every pay so that when @#$% hits the fan like now and he starts to loose everything he would still have a nice nest egg to live on in his new country of choice

This reminds me of when Cloe Kardashieng reinacted the scene where she get's stopped by the police for a DUI on her show. This is so wrong.

0 users disliked this comment Protest 7 minutes ago Report Abuse I saw this a bagillion miles away.   T.O. was spending way to much, and I mean way too much.   On the show he was buying diamond earings at Tiffany and didn't even blink on the 110k+ price stickershock.   That is the kind of stupidity that lands people into bankruptcy and overleverage pronto.   His advisors likely fired him, that is why they aren't returning his phone calls.   Here comes the blame game next;   it's not my fault, he got bad advise, no one told me I was spending too much, I was going to make a big salary forever.

I love his comment that someone said he is good with his finances, that is crap.   Everyone knows that athletes, especially footballs player, are horrible with their money.   And the Black card comment.   That is a joke too and he obviously has idiots that surround him.   Anyone can get a Black card, there are limits and who gives a crap what credit card someone is paying with.   Thanks for giving them a Amex they had credit with him... they will discontinue his card now ASAP.   I would.

Hopefully T.O. has something to fall back on ; (. 

Time to cut T.O. off.

0 users disliked this comment shaneb 7 minutes ago Report Abuse The guys makes an obscene amount of money to play a game and he is living paycheck to paycheck. This is a textbook example of someone being @#$% rich. He has to spend all of his money and be flashy and have way too many expensive cars and houses for one man. He will be broke in a few years when his career is over.

0 users disliked this comment AUBERGINE ---  PROUD WICC ... 8 minutes ago Report Abuse What a sick sick lot all sports fans and players are these days.    we buy and sell young men who started playing a game as a kid on a play ground.    he was good at the game........really good so he was groomed first by a high school coach then a big time university pushed him through because he was a great player.    then the draft pick came and he was passed around the bargainning table like a prized bull.    oh lord!!! he was proud to be drafted and land that multi million dollar contract.    he was head up, shoulders back, god's gift...............his teams god!!    if he wanted it, no problem bro it is yours.    the team raises the season ticket prices and the nose bleed seats well who cares if those poor @#$% pay five or six dollars more.    they will want to see their team play and our new god player.    now the whirlepool begins!    the player likes his new sports car, the beautiful women hanging on him everywhere he goes.      he buys expense bling and trouble seems to slide off with ease.    the fans are so stupid that they willingly pay any price to go to see this piece of work run up and down the field.    he isn't doing as well as advertised..............that whirlepool is pulling.    it seems he is having a few behavior problems.    you know he was told by everyone from the beginning that he was perfect so why does he have to be there like the other players?    he is cool and doesn't need to workout with the team.    round and round, down and down and all that money and hangers on have made him a clown!    why don't we the fans demand that the owners and the players sit down with a committee of educated fans that can look at the three side of the situation come to a reasonable conclusion and settle the contract issue for one final time.    i suggest the group be made up of 1 priest, 1minister, 1rabi, 1 player mother, 1female fan, 1male fan, 1 grandmother, 1 lawyer, 1banker/accountant, 1teacher, 1 player and i owner.      i am a grandmother and i would be pleased to filled that spot.    it would be a pleasure to start the ground work for the group too.    in the mean time players and owners a like to solve your current questionsand problems i have the answer.    you must with all your power, firmly grab hold of your shoulders and with all the strength you can bring............pull your @#$% head out of your @#$%!!!!    owners you have more than enough money............use it to do good in the world!!!    players, you make plenty of money invest,save, if you can't manage it get help or contact me i'll help you.    if you don't save and invest, you will have nothing when your knee goes out and you are old and no body wants your @#$% any more!!!      that's right pretty boy......like mr.t.o.    your knee is a mess, your mortgage is due and your money is gone to that high almighty mis thing and her sister girl that travels with you on your show.      yeah, you cute, yeah you te man and yeah she would drop it like it's hot for you but the mortgage is due and where are you?    you a sad mess and in bad need of a good grandmother to get you well with your knee and you wallet.    and for god's sake start using your own head and know your own bisiness!!!

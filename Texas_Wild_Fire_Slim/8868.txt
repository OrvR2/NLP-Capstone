PALLEKELE, Sri Lanka (AP) — Seam bowlers Ryan Harris and Trent Copeland shared five wickets as Australia tightened its grip on Sri Lanka in the second test, reducing the hosts to 150-8 at tea on the opening day Thursday.Resuming after lunch on 76-5, Sri Lanka's sixth wicket pair Kumar Sangakkara and Anjelo Mathews shared the best partnership of the innings with a combined 52 runs.Sangakkara was dismissed on 48 by part-time seamer Mike Hussey caught by Phil Hughes. He hit seven boundaries during his 121-ball innings. Suraj Randiv and Seekkuge Prasanna were later dismissed cheaply. Anjelo Mathews remained unbeaten on 43.Harris returned best bowling figures of 3-23, with Copeland and spinner Nathan Lyon also taking two wickets each.Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat first but soon fell into trouble on a pitch that offered help for seam bowling.Harris removed opener Tharanga Paranavitana (0) caught behind in the third over. The left-hander played at a delivery moving away from him and the ball took a slight edge through to wicketkeeper Brad Haddin.Tillakaratne Dilshan (4) left a delivery from Copeland alone but the ball nipped back sharply to hit off stump. Copeland then had Mahela Jayawardene (4) caught by Hussey diving at gully to leave the hosts at 14-3.Sangakkara and Thilan Samaraweera shared 43 runs to raise hopes of a revival by the hosts, but Harris returned to have Samaraweera (17) caught by Haddin, and Prasanna Jayawardene (18) joined the procession back to the pavilion, caught by Harris off the bowling of spinner Nathan Lyon.Sri Lanka must win the match to have a chance of claiming the three-test series. Australia won the first test by 125 runs.Shaun Marsh received his first test cap for Australia from his father, former test opener Geoff Marsh. He replaced Ricky Ponting who returned home for the birth of his second child after playing the first test.Sri Lanka spinner Rangana Herath was left out after he suffered a finger injury and leg spinner Prasanna was included for his debut, as the second spinner alongside Randiv.

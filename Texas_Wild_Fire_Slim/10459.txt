On September 29, 2005, there was a celebration of the accomplishments of those who have dedicated their talents to spreading a leafy green canopy over Texas - the 2004 Texas Community Forestry Awards Program.

"This program was open to anyone who has a role in building stronger communities by planting and nurturing trees or leading others to perform that service," says James Hull, director of the Texas Forest Service.

Winners were announced to the over 200 attendees at an evening awards banquet during the annual Texas Tree Conference held this year in Waco. Each award winner received a numbered, remarked and framed, limited-edition print of a painting  specially commissioned for the program.

Texas Community Forestry Awards Program is sponsored by the Texas Forest Service, the Texas Urban Forestry Council and the Texas Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture. This year, dozens of individuals and organizations were recognized for their work developing and preserving the state's community forests.

"Each award reflects exemplary efforts to protect and enhance the urban forest through creativity, leadership, individual dedication or innovative partnerships," said Hull.

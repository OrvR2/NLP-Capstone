																				Tar Balls On Alabama Beaches To Be Tested
									




			Tar balls washed in by Tropical Storm Lee are amid shells on the beach at Gulf Shores, Ala., on Tuesday, Sept. 6, 2011. City officials suspect the tar balls are left over from the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico last summer. Officials said Tuesday that they plan to test the black and brown globs to find out if they're related to last year's oil spill. (AP Photo/Jay Reeves)

GULF SHORES, Ala. — Heavy surf churned up by Tropical Storm Lee sent tar balls rolling onto Alabama's prime tourist beaches, and officials said Tuesday that they plan to test the black and brown globs to find out if they're related to last year's oil spill.
Brandon Franklin, the coastal plans manager for the city of Gulf Shores, said officials are collecting samples that will be sent to Auburn University for testing.
The exact origin of the tar balls is still unclear, and BP isn't taking responsibility for the tar balls just yet. It has sent survey teams to conduct post-storm assessments along coastal beaches to determine what may have developed on the beaches and barrier islands as a result of Lee. The oil giant is prepared to mobilize response crews to affected areas if necessary, spokesman Tom Mueller said.
Orange Beach Mayor Tony Kennon said most of the tar balls there were very small. The tar balls visible at Gulf Shores ranged from the size of a marble to nearly the size of a baseball.
Connie Harris of Alabaster, Ala., had stayed at a condominium in Gulf Shores over the Labor Day weekend with three friends. When she returned from a beach walk, she had to scrub her feet with soap and a wash cloth, she said.
"When we walked on the beach, we had tar on our feet," Harris said.
Grant Brown, a spokesman for the city of Gulf Shores, said he had been told the situation wasn't as bad as last year, when oil fouled beaches all along the Gulf Coast because of the BP oil spill. But it was significant, he said.
"It confirms our fear that there are tar mats just offshore and that we may have more tar coming in whenever there's a storm," he said.
Elsewhere, the remnants of Lee have knocked out power to thousands, churned up rough ocean surf and drenched areas with rain that left some rivers and creeks topping their banks. At least four people have died because of the storm, including a swimmer who went missing off the Alabama coast.

				We are not finished with the BP destructio­n our Gulf. There is a lot more that will be found. Although the discussion has stopped on the toxins they poured into The Gulf as a despersant­: Corexit 9500, their long term impact will evolve in a negative way. People are still getting sick and some are dying even without the media attention. I strongly urge them to send samples to more laboritori­es that just Auburn University for testing.
It has grown more obvious that BP cares nothing about life. A more recent example is the release of the Lockerbee killer back to Libya, and this little war there too. Oil over  life is their motto.

				Growing up in Florida in the 70's we had tar on the beach all the time.  A day at the beach meant cleaning off your feet with turpentine to remove the tar.  Tar is nothing new and doesn't necessaril­y mean it is from the oil spill.  I don't think all the oil could have been cleaned up from the oil spill . How do you clean it off of the ocean floor.  While oil spills are very bad for the ocean, the ocean floor itself without the help of man can leak oil as well.

				Do you really think the BP spill was cleaned up?  It just is not in plain view,not until something like this shows up. The oil companys never really clean up much at all,but get by making claims that they do.

				How long have tarballs been wasing up on this beach? I know that we have had them in Texas for decades. As have several other beaches that I have visited along the Gulf Coast. Tarballs are nothing new, being produced from passing tankers and freighters and natural oil seeps in the Gulf. They can even be found on the beaches in the Caribean and Bermuda. More eco sensationa­lism.

				Tar balls used to come ashore at Rockaway beach in the 40s and 50s before the rules on bilge cleaning by tankers and freighter were changed. Small but sticky balls. My father used bacon fat to clean his and our feet to dislodge the gluey tar, Worked fine, fast and not too messy

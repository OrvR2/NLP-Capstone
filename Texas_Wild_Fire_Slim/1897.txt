In a March 9, 2011 photo Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino appears onstage at the Comedy Central Roast of Donald Trump in New York.   Abercrombie & Fitch Co. says in a news release Tuesday Aug. 16, 2011 that they are concerned that having Sorrentino  seen in its clothing could cause "significant damage" to the company's image, and has offered a payment for him and other cast members of "Jersey Shore" to not wear the company's clothes on the show.

Gwyneth Paltrow thanked for 9/11 interventionBy Kwala MandelPostsBy Kwala Mandel | The Upshot – Thu, Aug 18, 2011

In an unusual twist of fate, one grateful New Yorker credited Gwyneth Paltrow with her survival on Sept.11. In an interview with The Morton Report titled "How Gwyneth Paltrow Saved My Life on 9/11," Lara Lundstrom Clarke explained the domino effect of a chance encounter with the actress.
Clarke says she was hurrying to her office in the twin towers, where she was an account manager at Baseline Financial Services on the 77th floor of tower 2. In order to catch the train on time, she jaywalked across 7th Avenue. "It was one of those mornings that felt good -- you had a little skip in your step. What the heck — I always cut across 7th Avenue. Then all of a sudden a silver Mercedes SUV came barreling down towards me," she told The Morton Report.
After the car screeched to a halt, she and the driver fell into a "who-goes-first" situation, and Clarke looked up and saw it was Paltrow behind the wheel. Clarke says Paltrow waved her across the street but the incident cost her valuable minutes. She reached the subway just in time to watch the doors close.
She was forced to catch the next subway train, which kept her from reaching her office before the attack that killed four of her coworkers. "If I had made that train, I would have been at my desk on the 77th floor of 2 World Trade Center," she told The Morton Report, adding that she wrote a letter to Paltrow to thank her.
Paltrow's publicist confirmed the story and told People that Paltrow was "deeply moved" by it.

Kelly is a #$%$If yopu can thank god for sparing the lady, be certain to thank him and give him credit for making this happen.The mooseleem pigs that did this was working for god, and since all you thumpers give him credit - be honest and show you are a credible person.Otherwise - I need some TP, got a kooran, torah or bible?

I've avoided Paltrow's movies over EACH of the past 10 years, like I avoided Robby Benson movies in 1980. I lead a happy life. Go to a museum. Read a book. Do NOT stay tuned if Gwyneth appears in an acting role on your TV screen and DO NOT EVER WATCH HER AS SHE LABORS THROUGH A SONG!!!

The point is everyone has story..some great articles...some not so great.  nevertheless each has meaning for someone; even if we think its fate, luck, or intervention by someone.

Gywneth doesn't deserve the credit.  It was Pete Townsend that saved her.

Gywneth was driving to her hair appointment.  Unfortuantely she was a few minutes late because a homeless man was hasseling her as she walked to her car.  If she had been on time, the lady would have crossed the street ok.

The homeless guy was heavily influenced in the 60's by the hippie movement.  He fried his brain on LSD and worshipped Charles Manson as new age leader.  This resulted in ruining what would have been a fine career in law and instead he has been homeless since the early 70's.

Charles Manson was heavily influenced by the Song Helter Skelter by the beetles.  Without that song Manson would not have comitted those murders and would have never been famous enough to influence the homeless guy.

Paul McCartney wrote Helter Skelter after listening to an interview about Pete Townsends lates single "I can see for miles and miles"

So ArizonaGal, are you saying any actor or actress needs an AWARD for being like 10's of thousands of other people on the planet. No Drugs... No Rehab... No Jail... but if someone shows their naked xxx on the big screen movies.... or shows an sexual act in the NAME of doing a movie it is OK??? What a double standard.

I don't know Gwyneth Paltro. So I can not speak about her personally.

However, I am now talking about the industry that she works within. In many ways that is just like another profession I can think of that women do for money. Not too much difference... just the cost. Millions VS Hundreds.

These people are professional whores for money. The only difference is the price.
Put the LABEL of MOVIE on the SAME BEHAVIOR and wala you are a STAR.... SPECIAL... you are great... 

The Godless Society... At least a whore is honest and know what they are... there are no cover up and make it pretty. 

Oh... but I meditate and do daily yoga some actors will say. Give we a break... with that we should hire the street walker that continues to prostitute their self to advertise Church. It is the SAME Energy. Just dressed up in a nicer car, dress and home.... and the PRICE is in the Millions not hundreds.

The movies and TV industries are one of the MAIN REASONS we have problems with kids and young adults today, as that industry has GLORIFIED... Sex Drugs and Jail and very bad behavior.... and if they do those things and do YOGA TOO... some way it is all OK now.

They see no self-respect or lives lived lived with honor or self-respect... from these highly paid pre-Madonna's. Girls kissing Girls and WOW they are all cheers look what we did. Be like us. .

We have a very sick and dysfunctional society and the HOLLYWOOD INDUSTRY is right in the CENTER of the problem.

IT is just like a Pimp the movie Pimps that are SELLING movies with lots of naked FLESH, Blood and Guts, and very bad behavior by the actors. Our kids do not have a chance. These people SCREAM.. we are so special the rich and wonderful. BE LIKE US..

It would be nice if Hollywood would CLEAN UP it's act. If for no other reason it would put a different MESSAGE in the MINDS of our society.

If she hadn't been breaking the law by jaywalking, she would have been saved too-imagine that!  I can't stand Paltrow, ever since she made snotty remarks about how bad Titanic was just because of her sour grapes over turning down the part of Rose. The woman named her child Apple for crying out loud-she's not a hero, she's a #$%$

What a lame article, she saved her life for being her. Gwenyth probably is now convinced her poop doesn't smell.

Anyone know where Paltrow was when the towers were struck?  Sounds to me she would have been very close to the area when it happened, but don't recall seeing that in the past.

"Clarke says Paltrow waved her across the street but the incident cost her valuable minutes."That's a load of #$%$ The entire incident would take about 4 seconds. This person missed the train because she was already late prior to the incident. That's why she was in a hurry in the first place. What saved her life wasn't Paltrow but her own tardiness. It seems that that is a normal occurrence with her. "I always cut across 7th Avenue".

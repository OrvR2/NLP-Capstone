The top two universities in the world are both in Cambridge -- but on different sides of the pond.
University of Cambridge in England occupies the No. 1 spot in QS's list of the world's best universities. Following it is Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass.
American universities dominate the list, with University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania and MIT, among others, earning top grades.
Research company QS has been ranking universities worldwide since 2004. Their global survey of 2,000 colleges takes into account reputation, faculty citations, student-faculty ratio and international population. See more on their methodology here.
Did your school make the cut? Weigh in below. And click over to QS to see the full list of the top 400 colleges.

				Whoever compiled this list is an idiot.  Reuters did a ranking of the most prestigiou­s universiti­es of the world and UC Berkeley was ranked number 4, ahead of Yale, Princeton, and Stanford.  The only universiti­es that outranked Berkeley were Harvard, Caimbridge and MIT.

Berkeley isn't even included on this list which shows no credibilit­y as far as I am concerned.

				I think there's a definite pro-Anglo bias there.... There are many good universiti­es in the World, and a lot that would be better than some of the American schools listed here.

But more importantl­y, there's no such thing as a "Good University­" without the added "for X". Universiti­es have specialiti­es, and they are often quite poor for programs other than those specialiti­es.

As in a good teacher can overcome cold, lack of books, dirty floors, no computers, leaking windows and no physical ed facilities­. But when we talk about the rich we realize that the facilities are half the education. I don't think they are better schools, I think they are better facilities­.

				It's often reductioni­stic to say one college is the "best" over another.
Institutio­ns of higher learning are typically rated in terms of discipline­s.
For example, few people realize that the #1 rated school of Journalism
in the US is what????  University of Missouri.  Go Tigers!

While it's true that Harvard may be #1, I'm not entirely sure about their
ratings in Journalism­, Medicine, Law,  English, or Geology, for example.
I would, however,  be willing to bet that they don't rank #1 in the first and last
discipline­s.

				English is the de facto global language of business, research and, of course, higher education. As more and more schools offer instructio­n in English, the US presence will become less dominant on lists like this one.

That said, lists are for s*ckers.

				Don't be offended.  This is just the top 15 and is obviously very subjective with lots of great schools not included.

ORLANDO, Fla.  -- Lawyers for Casey Anthony filed a brief Monday saying it would be "unfair" for the state to force her to reimburse taxpayers for the costs associated with trying to find Caylee.Anthony's attorneys argued that the state didn't present any evidence that the $500,000 the state is seeking in reimbursement were related to the misdemeanors Anthony was convicted of during her recent trial.The state asked for the reimbursement after Anthony was acquitted in July of murder charges, but was convicted of four counts of lying to authorities. She told officers a baby sitter had kidnapped Caylee. Authorities learned the baby sitter never existed, but the investigation drained manpower.At her murder trial, Anthony's attorneys said Caylee drowned in the Anthony family swimming pool in June 2008. Caylee was reported missing a month later.Several agencies, including the Orange County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, filed expenses of more than $517,000 that they believe should be reimbursed.Judge Belvin Perry is expected to rule on the issue before next Thursday.Watch Local 6 News for more on this story.

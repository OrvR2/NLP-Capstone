Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham took a series of brutal swipes at Sarah Palin on Tuesday's "O'Reilly Factor."
Ingraham was filling in for Bill O'Reilly, and she and Coulter agreed that Palin has outstayed her welcome.
"She's become sort of the Obama of the Tea Party," Coulter said. "She's just 'The One' to a certain segment of right wingers. And the tiniest criticism of her -- I think many of your viewers may not know this. No conservative on TV will criticize Palin, because they don't want to deal with the hate mail."
Ingraham said that Palin is too thin on policy to be a credible presidential candidate. She said people were "desperate" for "real substance" and that Palin doesn't seem "all that interested in digging really, really deep on that stuff."
Coulter said that Palin's die-hard fans were becoming a real problem.
"You know, we used to all love Sarah Palin, conservatives like me, for her enemies," she said. "I'm starting to dislike her because of her fans." She added that, "it's true that liberals will call even smart conservatives stupid. That doesn't mean that when a liberal calls you stupid it makes you smart."

				Smart (not to confuse one's psychologi­cal handicap with a lack of intelligen­ce) conservati­ves such as Ms. C are (since they ARE smart) acutely aware that the supporters of the party of Ms. P have the power to lose the election for the republican­s as they represent the single largest voting bloc within the party and will ultimately choose the contender.

				Wow! The HuPU actually paying attention to Laura and Ann? Oh! Because they're sort of attacking the(suppos­edly) irrelevant Sarah Palin. Look Dems......­.Obama LOSES because he thinks America is the thief of the world. We've done NO good anywhere, EVER. He believes we should be rated much further down economical­ly than the 5th place we just fell to. Tell me how good our economy is under Obama? And please, screaming "Its Bushs fault" doesn't cut it anymore.

				You're right.  The Bush's fault doesn't cut it anymore because there are so many more Republican­s to blame.   Bush ran through the sizable surplus he was given and involved our nation in two unfunded wars:  Bush's fault and the continuing cause of very serious problems.   Currently, Republican­s have no jobs plan, no healthcare plan and no revenue raising plan.  Their austerity and anti-tax stances are doing more harm than good.  Their posturing over the Debt Ceiling seriously undermined everybody'­s confidence in any recovery.  Too bad they have no intention for really working FOR America.  Yup, they get a lot of blame, too.

				It's a sure sign that Palin is no longer to be feared and has lost her place as Queen of Mean when the other mean girls publicly gang up on her.  Obviously she has lost her standing as "she who must be obeyed".
This makes it very evident that Palin is no longer "cool" in conservati­ve circles. (This and her really low poll numbers.)  She has finally become "a laughing matter" to her own team, and no matter how many tantrums she throws, and how mean she may get... no one is going to care.
It's over.

SAN ANTONIO -- The Texas Department of Transportation closed Highway 211 Friday night as crews battled a 250-acre wildfire on the far West side near Potranco Road.As of 10 p.m., it was only 20 percent contained, fire officials said.TxDOT officials said they expect the stretch of highway between U.S. 90 to FM 1957 to be open by 10 a.m. on Saturday."We could see it burning and then they came and told everybody to get out of the buildings," said Steve Graff, an area resident.A strong breeze and dry conditions made battling the blaze difficult."That presents a problem when you have a small little fire that can get out of control pretty easily," said Bexar County spokeswoman Laura Jesse.The fire quickly spread west, easily overpowering crews near Highway 211. Frefighters had to deal with dense brush, bringing in air support to help with the fight."It is extremely dry (and) hilly. It can present a problem for getting in there and getting some of the spots," Jesse said.Forest Service bulldozers cut cut fire lines all around the area, as more than a dozen different fire departments worked into the night to get the fire under control.
Area Residents Forced To Evacuate
When residents at the Pioneer Estates subdivision got word from the Bexar County Sheriff's Office to evacuate early Friday evening, they knew the fire that they had been watching all afternoon was getting worse..Pat Torres said he's lived in the area for five years and had never seen a fire get this bad."We're just waiting to see," he said Friday night. "We're all worried out here."More than 100 homes were evacuated in the area.Families grabbed clothes and important papers before they lined up to exit the subdivision. They were told to go to the Medina Valley Middle School, which was a safe distance away."We saw the flames, the black smoke and after 30 minutes or so, they sounded the fire alarm and told us to evaciuate," Torres said.The Red Cross has been set up at the middle school all night, bringing in food and other supplies.Medina Valley school officials said people from the community are also stepping in to help."We are happy to be a support system to our community," said Chris Martinez, assistant superintendent at Medina Valley Middle School. "We are happy to be here in this time of need. We understand that we are entrusted to be servants to our community and we're going to be here as long as it takes."

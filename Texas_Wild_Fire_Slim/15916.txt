IBM's Watson supercomputer, famous for 'Jeopardy'! moving to health insurance at WellPoint

Jim Fitzgerald, The Associated Press, 	On Monday September 12, 2011, 5:40 pm EDT


                    By Jim Fitzgerald, The Associated Press
              WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. - Enough with the fun and games. Watson is going to work.
IBM's supercomputer system, best known for trouncing the world's best "
                    Jeopardy!
                    " players on TV, is being tapped by one of the nation's largest health insurers to help diagnose medical problems and authorize treatments.
WellPoint Inc., which has 34.2 million members, will integrate Watson's lightning speed and deep health care database into its existing patient information, helping it choose among treatment options and medicines.
"This very much fits into the sweet spot of what we envisioned for the applications of Watson," said Manoj Saxena, general manager of an IBM division looking at how the computer can be marketed.
Lori Beer, an executive vice-president at Indianapolis-based WellPoint, agreed.
"It's really a game-changer in health care," she said.
The WellPoint application will combine data from three sources: a patient's chart and electronic records that a doctor or hospital has, the insurance company's history of medicines and treatments, and Watson's huge library of textbooks and medical journals.
IBM says the computer can then sift through it all and answer a question in moments, providing several possible diagnoses or treatments, ranked in order of the computer's confidence, along with the basis for its answer.
"Imagine having the ability within three seconds to look through all of that information, to have it be up to date, scientifically presented to you, and based on that patients' medical needs at the moment you're caring for that patient," said WellPoint's chief medical officer, Dr. Sam Nussbaum.
Saxena said the WellPoint application would likely be accessed from an ordinary computer or handheld device.
Beer said patients needn't worry that Watson will be used to help insurers deny benefits. If a doctor veers from Watson's diagnosis or treatment recommendations, the insurer would have a clinician review the case like it currently does. It won't base a claim decision solely on Watson.
"Ultimately the goal here is not denying treatment but getting people to the right care," Beer said, adding that Watson was not designed to replace humans.
Beer said WellPoint is trying to offer care providers a tool that helps lead to better treatment outcomes, which is what the insurer wants to base reimbursement on in the future.
Nussbaum said a pilot program will be rolled out early next year at several cancer centres, academic medical centres and oncology practices.
WellPoint is the nation's largest publicly traded health insurer based on enrolment. It operates
                    Blue Cross Blue Shield
                    plans in 14 states, including New York and California.
Neither party would say how much Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM is being paid. Saxena said it's the first money Watson has earned for the company; the $1 million it won on "
                    Jeopardy!
                    " earlier this year was given to charity.
Watson's next jobs will probably also be in health care, but financial services and public safety applications are on the horizon, Saxena said.

The last ones left to evolve on this planet live in third world countries.   Someone warn them to stay away from technology there still is hope.

3 users disliked this comment  8 hours ago Report Abuse I enjoyed watching Watson on Jeopardy, but I noticed that when he made a wrong answer, he often REALLY got it wrong, barely on the right planet. So, although he'll probably will be better than most doctors, it might not hurt to occasionally get a second opinion!

2 users disliked this comment Kelly 8 hours ago Report Abuse So starts the slow demise of the doctor. They will eventually just plug in your numbers and symptoms and out will pop a prescription. After all, what is doctoring (GP) beyond "guessing" what a person has based on medical knowledge and comparing that with symptoms? They're not like surgeons, who need the hands...

4 users disliked this comment weselliron 9 hours ago Report Abuse Great stuff - the end of any personal privacy giving complete and total control to the insurers. Now a data entry error will allow them to deny for months and years and possibly even as long as it takes the patient to die. Sorry, I'm not sold on anything that gives "big brother" more information and power.

4 users disliked this comment Catalin 14 hours ago Report Abuse Watson is a very powerful machine. I'm glad that they've found an use fr it. The thing that scares me the most is that it will cut medical personnel. I am all right with the technologization of schools, hospitals, etc. but I want the human jobs to remain, as people receive salaries, and help maintain the economy. Not only that, there is an ethic point of view of the situation.

5 users disliked this comment shlagg223 16 hours ago Report Abuse Just another step in the de-evolution of humans to say that we're not good enough, and away from the co-operation of human to human contact. Bottom line-- You don't have to do anything, think of anything, let a computer,and a handful of clinically based humans tell you what is good (and bad ) for all of us. Let the purification begin. We (as humans) need it more than a super computer.
I could say more, but that would further lndict the path that they ( the ruling class ) has set before us everyday humans.  
Who are we (as humans ) anymore?

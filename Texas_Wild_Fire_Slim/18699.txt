All the World's A Stage for Charlie Sheen: Charlie Sheen Roasted!







Photo Credit: AP



The whole world is a stage to Charlie Sheen, no matter how bad things get. After loosing his job on CBS' Two And A Half Men, admitting to weeks and weeks of drug fueled parties and orgies with porn stars living in his home, and giving quasi-psychotic interviews to network news which turned "winning" into one of the biggest pop culture phrases and internet meme's of the year, Charlie still managed to keep a huge smile on his face during his roast on Comedy Central. 

Mike Tyson, William Shatner, actress Kate Walsh took turns taking comedic stabs at the self appointed rocks-star from Mars with tiger's blood and Adonis DNA.


Our two favorite punchlines, cam from comedian Jon Lovitz and from the legendary William Shatner. 



Lovitz quipped, "How much (cocaine) can Charlie Sheen do? Enough to kill two and a half men."



Star Trak icon & current Priceline TV commercial face William Shatner offered Sheen the deal of a life time, telling him he could "book your next rehab stay through Priceline.com." in that famous Shatner straight face. 



Winning, indeed.

Jermaine Jackson says he would have flown Michael to safety!









Jermaine Jackson, brother to pop music's biggest icon Michael Jackson, revealed that he was ready to fly his brother to Bahrain in the event he was convicted during his 2005 trial. Michael Jackson faced a child molestation trial in 2005, of which he was found not-guilty. Had he, however, been found guilty, Jermaine claims he would have had his brother flown to Bahrain, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, effectively allowing his brother to become an exile. 

"Why should he go to jail for something he didn't do?" Jermaine asked.

What's your opinion? Personally we don't think it would have been a wise decision. Jackson's immense legacy was already slightly tarnished by the accusations. And although if he had been convicted of the allegations in 2005, even if wrongfully, becoming an exile and running from the country probably would have effectively ruined the legacy he left behind. What are your thoughts. Share them!

Artist of the Day: Beyonce Knowles









In honor of her amazing tribute to the victims of 9/11, and her unbelievably big heart, we couldn't help but make Beyonce our artist for the day. Since her debut in the late 1990's with the R&B supergroup Destiny's Child, Beyonce has risen to become one of the most unstoppable forces in music today. Continuously releasing successful album after album, she has quickly become one of the benchmarks of the music industry. She is, without a doubt, the current standard for female performers and even inspires her male counterparts to reach her level. Dubbed "Queen B" by her fans, she truly is the Queen of the music industry, delivering lush gorgeous performances, and jaw-dropping, heart-pounding dance extravaganzas! She has delivered hit after hit, ranging from pulsating irresistible club-bangers, to sweet, lucid, & introspective ballads. Her voice can be at once a sweet whisper, or a ranging hurricane-force blast; she switches from genre to genre effortlessly. As a performer she has the type of energy that commands stadiums full of people into a frenzy similar to that of the great performers who came before her. Without a doubt, she will become one of the legends of her time. We could type a book of things here to further display the genius and legendary potential of this woman, which is being realized each day...but we'll let her work speak for itself. Here's some of our favorite tracks, from Youtube:







































Here's the 9/11 tribute which we spoke of, which will certainly bring tears to your eyes! What a beautiful spirit she has to dedicate this lovely song to the lives and families of those who were lost in 9/11:








All of this combined makes Beyonce today's Artist of the Day! 

What are your opinions! Chime in with your thoughts!!!

Tribute on the Anniversary of September 11









It is tragic that we still live in a world where terrorism appears to 
be considered a valid means. Today, New York City is on high alert against potential terrorist activity. This threat comes on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack on American soil, and perhaps one of the worst tragedies in recent history. This attack comprised of the complete destruction of the two towers of the World Trade Center and portions of the Pentagon using airplanes; it has forever been memorialized as September 11. A fourth plane crashed into a field, although it's target has been postulated to have been a number of national landmarks and important government landmarks. Thousands of lives were lost. A war on terror, which spawned several battles and skirmishes in overseas locales was started. A new level of barbaric violence was breached by those who committed the crime, and a renewed international fear was spawned in those who were affected by it.

In the hindsight, the question begs to be asked: what is terrorism and the attacks associated with it supposed to accomplish? What is it a means to? Terrorism does help the forces and people who commit the acts; 
instead it results in these forces being wiped out by the major 
super-powers in the world who will not stand for terrorist acts. 
Terrorism does not assist in the spreading of the purported "cause" of 
terrorist groups. In fact, nobody wants to hear about the reasons 
terrorists use to justify their atrocities. Violent intentional attacks 
which result in severe and significant loss of life are never going to be
 validated, for any reason. It serves no purpose, but to 
further perpetuate violence. Violence begets more violence, and more 
violence, and responsive violence. War begets war. It is a constant 
cycle. Nothing can be accomplished by bloodshed, except the smearing and spilling of 
more blood, most of which is innocent. Yet terrorists continue to act 
out in violence against innocent groups and innocent people. When 
considering September 11th for instance, one has to ask what precisely 
was accomplished by killing thousands of innocent people. One horrible 
atrocity did not in any way accelerate the cause of the terrorists who 
committed it. If anything it ended up in their group and their cause being wiped out, and thousands of innocent lives were lost. 
Terrorists even use religious writ as validation for their horrid cause.
 However, the religious ideas used by terrorists are usually twisted, 
sick, psychotic perceptions that don't even fit in with the original 
religious ideas which were skewed and misinterpreted to support the vile
 acts. One would
 think if these people have the intelligence to create complex plans of 
violence and bloodshed, they could use that same intelligence and means 
to get their grievances, whatever they might be, heard on an 
international scale. No, there will never be an excuse for terrorism! No matter how much you ask: "Why", the only answer that comes to mind is the answer that the butler Alfred gave to Bruce Wayne, in the movie "The Dark Knight".

"Some men...just want to watch the world burn". 

We must learn as a human race, if we are to create a pattern of peace and survival for our children, that bloodshed
 will never lead to peace. Bloodshed will only beget responsive 
bloodshed. War will only beget war. Terrorism is and never will be a acceptable, no matter the cause, reason, or opinion. It is sick and vile.

On September 11, 2011, we lost thousands of lives which can never be brought back. Lives which were innocent and did not deserve to die in such a brutal attack. We remember those lives lost and offer our sympathy, love, and condolences to those families, because we realize no matter how much time goes by...they will never forget. And we, as a nation, must never forget as well.

Ten years have gone by since that tragedy, and we have grown as a nation, slowly, but steadily. Times have changed, people have changed, ideas have changed, gradually. We each were reminded on that day that we are, collectively, only human, and were shown the depths of the human capacity for violence and evil. What we learned, and are still learning, is to move toward to heights of the human capability to be instruments of peace and beacons of lights. We have learned that only by harmony, and harmonious interaction, will we be able to continue as a human race. This is a timeless idea, one that has been preached over and over by those who came before us, but in our lifetime and in our generation, it took this tragedy to remind us.

Today, on the ten year anniversary of September 11, we remember those lives which were lost on that day, and the lives of the troops which were lost in the battles which followers. We offer our love and support to the families of those whose lives were lost, knowing that the space left behind by their loves one will never be replaced. Finally, we offer a prayer, a prayer that is without religious affiliation...a simple human prayer that each of us will learn that as a human race, it is only love, unity, and progression that will allow us to continue as a species and as inhabitants of the Earth.

T.C., Editor-in-Chief

Amy Winehouse's parents talk about her death and her legacy in interview!









TMZ shares video from an interview given by Amy Winehouse's parents regarding her death. Amy's death was such a tragic loss not only to her and friends, but to the world who she touched and who identified with her in a plethora of ways from her more serious struggles with drugs and alcohol, to her more common place struggles with love, life, and relationships. Amy touched people in a variety of ways, primarily because she was so very human and so very flawed; we each could see ourselves in her art in some kind of way.

We suggest taking a look at the interview, hosted by Anderson Cooper, for more information about Amy and what plan are for continuing her legacy in music and in the world.

Shocker! Jackie Kennedy Onassis didn't like Martin Luther King!











video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player


Beloved Former First Lady & style trendsetter Jackie Kennedy-Onassis thought that civil rights activist and one of America's shining beacons of peace, Martin Luther King, was "terrible". This according to ABC News, who has released information from newly released interviews. "I just can't see a picture of Martin Luther King without thinking, you know, that man's terrible". Representative John Lewis, a legendary civil rights activist and a close friend of King's, says that the Former First Lady was against King primarily because of stories told to her by FBI Director, J Edgar Hoover, who told Robert Kennedy that King had made deragatory comments regarding President Kennedy's funeral. "He did everything possible to make Dr. King look like somebody from 
another planet. I cannot believe that Dr. King 
ever said anything in a negative manner about President Kennedy.  He 
admired, he loved … the Kennedy family."

Mrs. Kennedy-Onassis said, "He made fun of Cardinal Cushing and said that he was drunk at it. And 
things about they almost dropped the coffin and -- well, I mean Martin 
Luther King is really a tricky person.". She went on to say, "


Her daughter, Caroline Kennedy, defends her saying: "Obviously J. Edgar Hoover had passed on something that Martin Luther 
King said about my father's funeral, to Uncle Bobby and to Mommy. And 
obviously, she was upset about that. It shows you the poisonous activities of J. Edgar Hoover, and the 
idea that this is going on at the highest levels of government is really
 twisted. If you asked her what she thought of Martin Luther King overall -- I mean she admired him tremendously,".

Michael Beschloss, a historian, claims that Hoover was purposefully trying to turn the Kennedy's against Martin Luther King, by feeding her information that he knew would instantly anger her.

Mrs Kennedy-Onassis, did however say her husband refused to judge King based on what the tapes contained, stating: "He said what an incredible speaker he was during that freedom march thing".

Diane Sawyer will be leading a two hour special entitled "Jacqueline Kennedy: In Her Own Words which will air Tuesday, September 13, 2011 at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.

Stories like this are a sad reminder of a country's racist and prejudiced past, and an even sadder reminder that some of the people who are most admired from generations past and who have become icons, were still party to the negative ideas of the time. What is your opinion? Was Mrs. Kennedy-Onassis really sharing her own opinion on King...a real opinion. Or was she in fact under the poisonous misinformation of J Edgar Hoover.

Chime in with your thoughts!

Family doesn't want pictures of whale-trainers death released





Dawn Brancheau was a Seaworld Orlando trainer who was attacked by killer whale Tilikum, during a show on February 24, 2010. The Orlando Sentinel is now reporting that her mother, brother, and sister are fighting against U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration to prevent them from releasing copies of videos or pictures depicting her death or the attempts to revive her. Her lawyers say the photos and videos are of no value to the public. Her lawyers say the family have a "deeply personal and intimate privacy interest" in protecting the videos from the public. They previously won an injunction against the Orange County Sheriff's Office, to prevent them from releasing photos and videos taken on the scene.

We can't understand why anyone would want pictures or videos of her brutal attack and death, or attempts to revive her, released to the public. Obviously authorities may need the videos or pictures to file the case in future situations, and we can imagine that scientists who work with whales or aquarium planners might observe the video to try to figure out what went wrong and how to protect trainers in the future, but we can imagine a reason for these images or videos to be available to the general public.

What is your opinion? Is the release of these videos and pictures acceptable? Or is the family absolutely right and should the privacy of their loved one be respected.

Tiger kills mate in a "love triangle" of the animal kingdom!







Photo credit: AP


 Fits of pique and jealousy ending in the doom of a lover are not only limited to the human species. It even happens in the animal kingdom as well. 

Yahoo is reporting that a female tiger, a 3-year old Malaysian tiger named Seri, killed her mate, 6-year old Wuzi. Both tigers were lent to El Paso Zoo as part of American Zoo Association's Species Survival Plan, designed to save critically endangered species through captive breeding. Originally there had been believed to be no signs of aggression leading to the attack reported. However, it is now being reported that in June, zoo authorities recognized what they terms a "tiger love triangle" between Wuzi, Seri, and the much older 15 year old female Meli.

Wuzi, the male, liked both females Seri and Meli. However, Seri and Meri did not like each other, with zoo authorities calling them "jealous". Doesn't sound like something to different from the human species. We've heard of and seen several instances of jealousy between a young beautiful lady and a older, more experienced "cougar". Occasionally, there's a man involved, and there have been instances when things have turned violent.

Seems like humans and animals are not that different at all. What are your thoughts?

Adele is Making Talent Cool Again





Pop radio in these days are at all time low. With every song being a dance record of sorts, one could literally sing the lyrics of four separate songs within the Hot 100 and not realize they are all indeed different songs. Heavy synthesizers, fist pumping bass lines, and auto tune vocals make records these days quite predictable. And then there is Adele.Adele reached success with "Chasing Pavements" on her first album "19". With her voice strong, and almost squeaky in a sense, the British singer won the hearts of many. She relies on belting out astonishing phrases of witty self-pinned lyrics coming only from true experiences. But even with such an abundance of raw talent, many wouldn't expect Miss Adkins to become the-dare I say-'pop star' she is now.She simply does not fit into the cookie cutter of such a title. There is no gimmick within the "Rolling in the Deep" singer's act. She wears black everyday. Her videos are always in a grayish tone . And her live performances consist of her standing at a mic, and sending her audience into a trance of memorized trances by doing nothing other than singing. The success of her latest LP is undeniable. While breaking global music records, with only two singles, "21" is surely a classic album to be remembered for all time.  Pure music is her aim.  Adele is more than a breathe of fresh air. She is the first gust of wind newly released prisoner feels upon becoming free. He knows that such movement of air hitting his face is real, yet not always promised. Adele intrigues me, as she does many-simply because she has shown true talent can shine through the polluted airwaves of the radio. She excites me for the future of the music industry. Just think of how the industry itself works. One iconic-ish pop star creates tremendous sucess, while many labels try to emulate one of their own to compete.  It has happened with Madonna, Janet Jackson, Lauryn Hill, Beyonce, Britney Spears, and countless other influential icons in music. The record labels must be taking notes.I for one am excited of the idea of record labels searching for talented, humble, and sexually conservative acts. What do you think? Will Adele's overwhelming success bring music industry back to..well..music?

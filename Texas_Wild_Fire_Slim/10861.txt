I miss the Waco Hippodrome
By Carl Hoover
I got an email last month about Austin's Zachary Scott Theatre production of "Red Hot Patriot: The Kick-Ass Wit Of Molly Ivins" and sighed. A few weeks after that, I started to receive notices of independent movies screened this fall at festivals across the state and sighed again.
Where are you, Waco Hippodrome, when we need you?
Small, sassy plays like the above one on spirited Texas journalist Molly Ivins or the one-woman show about Bonnie Parker (the Bonnie of Bonnie and Clyde) that traveled across Texas some years ago) or most anything by Fort Worth's Jubilee Theatre or any one of Dallas' stages would fit perfectly on the Waco Hippodrome stage.
The same goes for the small films, some shot locally, that tend to be the mainstay of film festivals in, well, every Texas metropolis. Wouldn't it be nice to see such films at the Hippodrome once more?
It's been more than a year since the Waco Hippodrome Theatre shut its doors and while life goes on in Waco, the theater's absence has meant a thinner entertainment scene. The last I heard, some negotiations over city-owned space in the alley between the theater and the Waco Hippodrome annex have held up the latter's sale, whose income is needed not only to wipe the Waco Performing Arts Company budget clean, but provide a little margin to plan for the future and make some repairs.
I know WPAC board members who are frustrated that things aren't moving faster, but it's better to solve issues one by one than see unresolved problems pop up in the future. I can't argue with that, but part of me gets worried that the longer the Hippodrome is quiet, the more accustomed Waco residents will be to its absence and less likely to do the work needed to support its reopening and early seasons.
Maybe that fear's misplaced and the theater's past fans will rekindle their interest once plans are announced to reopen the historic venue. But I've seen a few Waco arts organizations and festivals die in my time here and the current political winds are blowing against all but private support of the arts. I'm missing the Hippodrome now, but hoping it's not a permanent loss.

Waco has a few big time philanthropists. I've never understood why none of them have no interest in this project. But what do I know?

I understand your pain. I hope I am incorrect, but generally, if something disappears around Waco for too long, it is forgotten and has a hard time getting started again. Maybe the WPAC has a magic button they can push to once again light up the Hippodrome brighter than it was before.

In My Opinion ...




Should Baylor sue if A&M leaves the Big 12?

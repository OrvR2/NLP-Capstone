WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama welcomes Jimmie Johnson and other drivers from last year's Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup to the White House on Wednesday.
The president will honor Johnson's unprecedented fifth consecutive Sprint Cup Series championship and NASCAR's community service.
Four drivers say they won't be there, but they say it doesn't have anything to do with politics. Greg Biffle, Tony Stewart, Carl Edwards and Kevin Harvick have cited scheduling conflicts.
Earlier in the day, Obama will have meetings with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.

It's no secret that the United States citizenship test is tough. After all, it's designed to ensure applicants have a firm understanding of how American government works. Doesn't it seem a little unfair that people born in the U.S. never have to prove their smarts? 
So a faction of people are proposing that all citizens be required to take a test before being able to vote, because it's important whether or not you think Andrew Jackson is a former President or a lost member of the Jackson 5.
Conan O'Brien wasn't sure how he felt about the whole thing, so on last night's "Conan" he decided to try a few sample questions and see how he'd do. 
Surprisingly, he passed with flying colors.

				Having lived in Texas for 5 years I guarantee that half of any public school senior class would fail the test. now let's elect Perry and let him do that to the rest of the country. I hope no one ever tells him the world is flat.

				Is it sad that I know college students who have no clue who the vice president is? Just met two this past month. One of them was looking at a car with an Obama/Bide­n sticker and they asked, "who's Biden?!", mispronoun­ced it too.

				Basically this kind of "test" is to find the true believers and a transpared effort to carve out the best possible outcome for the GOP/TPers.­.   Has the tri-corner hat replaced brown shirts?

The GOP/TP agenda is forever fracturing this country. " Liberty and Justice" for those who accept our dogma and the rest of you are not worthy.  Or worse.

It is that stark.

				Very true, sir.  But as a test required of exsiting US citizens and resistered voters to qualify/di­squalify as voters...?  it's up there with the "poll tax" of the Jim Crow era.

Do not get me wrong.  I have often bemoaned the lack of historical awareness, which make people the mark of those who revise history for their own gain, and the absence of critical thinking which is so plain and painful in many chats - including we good folks who particapat­e with HP.

I think civics in education is most important and a "voters exam" prior to resistrati­on for voting i.e. a minimum of awarness of history and civics is not on its face, a bad idea.  Much like a driver's licence exam is a good thing prior to operating a vehicle.  What I strongly object to the the targeted applicatio­n of any exam that could a) limit an already registered voter and b) any exam that was not created by a transparen­t, body with no political agenda.  

Then it starts to have merit.

				And there I was, reading the tweet "Can Conan pass a U.S. citizenshi­p test?" and thinking of Conan the Barbarian doing that test... Which would be kinda funny, too... Like "What is best in life?" - "To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentatio­n of their women."

				Most people could not answer these questions unfortunat­ely. There was a person who would stop people on the street of NTC and ask such things as where is Cuba. The answers were embarrassi­ng. The land referenced in the Louisiana purchase is found where? The woman answered New Orleans.

				I'm sure the GOP/TPers would provide cheat-shee­ts for the lemmings so they won't fail miserably.

This, by the way, is NOT America.

				That was actually a pretty easy test. I only missed 1, becasue I couldn't remember my Mayor's last name. We just all call him Mayor Bob, but I don't think they would take that as an actual answer if it was asked. How would anyone not get at least a 90% on that test though?

Maybe I'm giving Americans too much intellectu­al credit again.

A home known as the "Scottish Castle" is listed on the market for $8.7 million.
The 14,483 square foot "castle" features antique columns, crystal Murano chandeliers, natural stone walls and grand halls. Designed and built by KC Jones--owner of Cornerstone Custom Homes, Inc.--and his wife Janice, the estate even has secret passageways. Outside is a flagstone courtyard, garden, and a Colorado rooftop deck. 
"The interiors are purposely eclectic and random, which keeps things 'popping' and coming to life," Janice said in a press release.

				Scottish Castle? It looks like a confused mess of rock, stone, stained glass, French, English, "Old World",  Mountain rustic and contempora­ry, all combined with horrible wall colors. Ick - not a great place to me. But, heck, good luck to them selling it.

				my ancestors in the 12th century had two castles in Scotland, but they were always on the wrong side politicall­y, so they lost their lead.  One of the castles, Rothes, was presided over by three "ladies" in succession­, as there were no male heirs for Peter Pollock (off knighting too much?) The title Lady of Rothes came down to the present, I read, and the last one was Lady Georgiana Maxwell.  I often think of the Ladies of Rothes, Mauricle, Eva, and the unnamed Lady who gave up her lead to Sir Normal de Leslyn, from a family which got rich by marrying well.

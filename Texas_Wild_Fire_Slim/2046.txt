Ron Paul said the Transportation Security Administration is "abusive" toward passengers and "accused of all kind of sexual activities" during Tuesday's GOP debate, hosted by NBC News and Politico.
"Look at the monstrosity we have at the airports," Paul said. "These TSA agents are abusive. Sometimes they're accused of all kinds of sexual activities on the way they maul people at the airport."
Paul said the government agency could not protect passengers as well as private companies and said the 9/11 attacks were the result of too much government involvement in airline security.
“They told the pilots they couldn’t have guns,” Paul said. “They set up the stage for this.”
Paul has spoken out against the TSA before, saying the government agency should be "abolished" and recommending that it be replaced with "real privatization of security."
During a July 4 audio address, Paul said, "The press reports are horrifying... children molested; disabled people abused. ... If the perpetrators were a gang of criminals, their headquarters would be raided by SWAT teams and armed federal agents. Unfortunately, in this case the perpetrators are armed federal agents. This is the sorry situation ten years after the creation of the Transportation Security Administration."

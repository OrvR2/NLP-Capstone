Astronauts' tracks, trash seen in new moon photosBy SETH BORENSTEIN - AP Science Writer | AP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011
REUTERS - NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) image released on September 6, 2011 shows the Apollo 17 site on the moon, where the tracks laid down by the lunar rover are clearly visible, along with the …more  last foot trails left on the moon. The images also show where the astronauts placed some of the scientific instruments that provided the first insight into the moon's environment and interior. LRO captured the sharpest images ever taken from space of the Apollo 12, 14 and 17 landing sites. Images show the twists and turns of the paths made when the astronauts explored the lunar surface. NASA says the image brightness and contrast have been altered to highlight surface details.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A spacecraft circling the moon has snapped the sharpest photos ever of the tracks and trash left behind by Apollo astronauts in their visits from 1969 to 1972.Images taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter from 13 to 15 miles up show the astronauts' paths when they walked on the moon, as well as ruts left by a moon buggy. Experts could even identify the backpacks astronauts pitched out of their lunar landers before they returned to Earth."What we're seeing is a trail," said Arizona State University geology professor Mark Robinson, the orbiter's chief scientist. "It's totally awesome."However, the photos were not close enough to see individual bootprints, Robinson said.The pictures were taken two weeks ago and show the landing sites for Apollo 12, 14 and 17. The closest images are of the 1972 Apollo 17 site, the last moon mission.Apollo 17 Commander Eugene Cernan wrote in an email to The Associated Press that the photo gives him a chance to revisit those days, "this time with a little nostalgia and disappointment. Nostalgia because those special days are fondly etched in my memory and disappointment because it looks like now we will not be going back within the days I have left on this planet."Two years ago, images from the same spacecraft from 30 and 60 miles out showed fuzzier images. But this year the orbiter dipped down to take about 300,000 more close-ups. The trails left by the astronauts are clear, but the places where backpacks were discarded, Apollo 17's moon buggy, and the bottom parts of the three lunar landers are blurry."You have to really look at it for a long time to figure out what you're looking at," Robinson said. For example, when it comes to the moon buggy he said, "if you squint really hard you can resolve the wheels and that the wheels are slightly turned to the left."At first, scientists thought they had a bit of a mystery: They saw more stuff than they expected. It turned out to be packing material and an insulation blanket, Robinson said.After 40 years there does not seem to be much moon dust covering the manmade trails. It probably will take about 10 million to 100 million years for dust to cover them, Robinson said.The photos were released a few days after the debut of the new fictional movie "Apollo 18" and before Thursday's planned launch of NASA's twin robotic spaceships to explore the moon's gravity.___Online:NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter: http://1.usa.gov/qTrKRwArizona State University Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera page:http://www.lroc.asu.edu/

must be another hoax from americans trying to convince the world that they landed on the moon. If you claim that the tracks are there and it will probably take a few million years for the moon dust to cover up... then how do you explain about the creaters in the moon?? creaters are created by meteors, tell me what are the chances that a meteor hit the moon surface and cause the "astronaut track" to cover up?!

Again.... The Soviet Union would of never allowed the US government to get away with a hoax, and there is no way in hell we could of fooled them. The Soviets could and did track every moment of that mission from lift off to splash down. RADAR tracking of the Apollo craft, interceptions of both outgoing and incoming transmissions..all of it.
Moscow stayed quite and cancelled their own man on the moon program? guess that means we beat em.

I'm okay with the litter. It proves we were there. Besides, the junk parts will eventually be collected some day, so admire the mark of exploration while you can.

I don't believe we landed anymore than I believe we did. I'm split down the middle. But how can you half wits look at this and find this as solid proof? Saying these tracks can't be faked? I'm sorry, but if we can make Keanu Reeves fly we can make a few computer generated videos... I'm not saying this is real or fake, I'm just saying people need to re-think how simple it actually might be to create this...

conspiracy theorist are going to be out in full force on this , because most were not even born when we were landing on the moon . The best thing they can do is blow their brains (what little they have) out and quit wasting good oxygen .  It ashame we stop the space program because I would have loved to spent at least one vacation on the moon .

Hahahahaha i love reading comments from people, depressed is actually showing his user name is aptly applied, i do agree photos of moon landings is a bit silly and would like to see our scientists doing better things.  Spending the money feeding starving people? No i think we should spend it on population control and a good war to get rid of the sniveling littly bit...s.

The comments here are the sad reflection of a dumbed-down population who have passively allowed their minds to be filled with hatred for America, The West, Judeo-Christian World View, everything.  James' was one of the few positive comments. Notably his worldview contained a Creator.  
Secular Humanism claims to replace God with humanity as the measure of all things.  Yet, instead of assuming god-like character, we have become less human and more animal-like.  Ironic, that we who recognize the Creator in Whose image we are created, think more highly of Humanity than those who see Humanity as the supreme intelligence on Earth.  
Trash?  No, historical artifacts are a more accurate description.  
For those who either read or saw the movie Atlas Shrugged, there is a scene when Hank Reardon a genius and perfectionistic metallurgist succeeds in creating a new alloy that vastly surpasses steel in every way possible, from lighter weight, to greater strength.  Out of the first casting of what would be a historic new material, he had created a bracelet of the metal as a gift for his wife on their anniversary.  It was the fruit of years of study, research, and trial and error.  His wife scorned it as a bracelet of what will one day be car fenders.  It is this that the self-righteous comments about Man's pollution of the Moon reminds me.  
Why do those who deny God and place Man above all, seem to be the same ones who despise mankind, and seem to compete to be the most self-loathing.  (But it is really only the children brought up to believe in self-esteem as a right, and not requiring the accomplishment of estimable things, that love to point out the "awfulness" of any impact of mankind upon the "virginal" earth and moon.  This allows a sense of superiority to those who have absolutely nothing to offer the world!  Those who do have the creative intellect are despised out of petty envy, dressed up as altruist concern for the "environment".

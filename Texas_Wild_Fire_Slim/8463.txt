Analysis: Pension funds in new crisis as deficit hole growsBy Natsuko Waki | Reuters – Mon, Sep 5, 2011






LONDON (Reuters) - Pension funds in developed economies are facing a new crisis as falling equities and tumbling bond yields widen their deficits, threatening the incomes and retirement dates of future retirees.
At the heart of their problems is a steady move by pension plans in the United States, euro zone, Japan and the UK to cut exposure to risk after the financial crisis.
But this "de-risking" may end up depressing their long-term returns from stock market investment and challenge the conventional wisdom that shares generate higher returns than bonds.
With weaker holdings and increased liabilities, companies will find it more difficult to fund existing pension schemes. They may cut new business investments as they use more cash to pay pensions.
For future pensioners, it means they will potentially face a lower retirement income and a longer working life -- or both.
This year has been a nightmare for many in the industry -- which controls $35 trillion, or a third of global financial assets -- and funding deficits are posting double-digit rises.
"We had a credit crisis and government bond crisis, and the third one we have is the pension crisis. This is the one where everything is going wrong and there's no obvious way out," said Kevin Wesbroom, UK head of global risk services at consultancy Aon Hewitt.
The sharp retreat in stocks through the summer has hurt them again by weakening their asset positions and threatening to erode stock market recoveries seen since the equity collapse surrounding the 2007-2009 credit crisis.
Even lower bond yields are proving to be a new headache.
"The real killer is liabilities are going up because in the flight to quality everyone gets out of equities and runs for cover in safe assets like government bonds, and yields are falling," said Wesbroom.
Many defined benefit(DB) pension plans -- where benefits are pre-determined -- pay a fixed stream of income to retirees.
The low-yielding environment makes it harder for the funds to meet these bond-like liabilities, forcing them to accumulate even more fixed income instruments to try to meet their obligations, creating a vicious circle.
FALLING YIELDS
Recent data on pension deficits highlight the plight of many pension funds.
In the United States, funding deficits of the 100 largest DB plans rose $68 billion to $254 billion in July, according to the Milliman Pension Fund Index. July marked the 10th largest deficit rise in the index's 11 year history.
Even if these companies were to achieve an optimistic annual return of as much as 8 percent and keep the current benchmark yield of 5.12 percent, their funding status is not estimated to improve beyond 93 percent by end-2013 from the current 83 percent.
Aon Hewitt estimates deficits of DB pension plans for FTSE 350 companies as of end-August rose 20 billion pounds from July to a 2011 high of 58 billion pounds. Their funding ratio stands at 89.8 percent, down from 94.1 percent three years ago.
The drop in the funding ratio is driven by a rally in the fixed income market. In Europe, the double-A rated corporate bond yield -- one of the benchmark rates used by regulators -- fell 300 basis points in the last three years to 3.55 percent, according to Barclays Capital.
The widely used rule of thumb is that a 50 basis points fall in the discount rate roughly results in a 10 percent increase in liabilities.
"Things look substantially worse now than they were during the credit crisis," said Pat Race, senior partner at investment consultancy Mercer.
In reaction to the past few years of an equity decline and volatility, many pension funds are indeed planning to buy more bonds, a move highlighted by Mercer's survey of over 1,000 European DB pension funds in May.
"Trustees do want to de-risk but financial directors have irrational desire to have equities. They are too wedded to equity markets," Race said.
"You still have massive uncertainties with a potential for another dip into recession. I don't see any reversion to days when equities are dominant part of DB plans."
JP Morgan's data shows pension funds and insurance companies in the United States, euro zone, Japan and UK bought $173 billion of bonds in the first quarter, boosting their bond buying for the third quarter in a row.
At the same time, they cut equity buying for a fifth quarter in a row, selling $22 billion of stocks in Q1.
In Europe, pension funds slashed their weightings for equities to an average of 31.6 percent in 2011 from 43.8 percent in 2006, while fixed income holdings rose to 54 percent from 47.8 percent in the same period, according to Mercer.
EQUITY PREMIUM PUZZLE
Growing pension funds deficits on corporate balance sheets may make it more difficult for companies to access credit and discourage firms which are already hoarding cash from spending cash to expand business.
For wider financial markets, the giant industry's gradual move away from stocks could hit equity risk premium -- excess return of equities over risk-free securities which compensates investors for taking on the relatively higher risk.
This may reinvigorate an academic debate where some economic analysis suggests the equity risk premium should be small, in most cases less than half a percentage point, as opposed to the widely-used range of 4-6 percent.
Indeed, 10-year U.S. Treasuries gave higher total returns in the past 10 years on a rolling basis than world stocks. http://link.reuters.com/nyv53s
"The puzzle... is that for the past 20 years, there has been no net equity risk premium. With the recent sell-off in risk and the rally in bonds, I think there might have been a net premium on bonds," Stephen Jen, managing partner at SLJ Macro Partners, said in a note to clients.
"This has turned financial theory on its head, and managers of pension funds and sovereign wealth funds need to think about this very carefully."

The tea B AG ROBOTS, ARE TOO STUPID TO RESEARCH, THEIR INSANE BIGOTRY OF OBAMA, IS ALL THEY THINK ABOUT.  IF A TEA BAGGER UNDERSTOOD POLITICS, THEY WOULD KNOW, THEIR OWN PARTY IF CRUCIFYING THEM AND USING THEM, KNOWING ALL TOO WELL, THE BIBLE BELT ARE NOT CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING.  OBAMA COULD CURE THE COMMON COLD, A TEA BAGGER WOULD SAY, WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG. FYCK THE TEA BAGGER.

You flipping right wing idiots already blaming Obama.These changes to allow pension funds to not be fully funded and/or funded with junk investments came about under lil' Bush by being tacked on to other legislation. They don't have to pay crap if they actually don't want to. Go do some research. I'm a retiree and I started receiving information from my company years before Obama even decided to run for president. I wasn't union and this has nothing to do with unions. It was structured to allow any company to under fund their retirement accounts and shift the burden to USA taxpayers of paying a percentage to those whose benefits are cut off when the company decides not to pay their retirees anymore. A company can in fact still be operating and just go before a judge and argue financial difficulty and have their obligation to their retirees removed. The board and presidents of those companies can still receive hefty bonuses and golden parachutes though. You ignorant right wing a-holes never cease to amaze me with your dumb uninformed rants against the left that were fueled by Fox and right wing propaganda machines. This country is sooo screwed.

Cops and firemen in California are allowed to retire at age 50 with 90% of their highest pay. So, on top of making $100,000 a year, they throw in saved up vacation time and unused holiday time so they can "spike" the amount calculated as "highest wage." The result?  Cops and firemen in California get pensions for life (with medical) of roughly $90,000 a year for life. And those are just the street level cops. Cops and Firemen of supervisor or management level routinely get pensions for life of over $200,000 a year.  YEAH. Thats fair to the voters.

Yes, the tea bags want to stick it not only to their own families, just as long as those CEO" can keep stuffing their pockets full of cash.  They want to take from the Poor and keep on giving to the likes of Vomit Donald Trump, Koch Bros, Rupert Murdoch.

What is insane in the thinking of the tea brainwashed zombies.  Their hate of the half black President. racist evil that runs through their veins, is they want to crush America and it's citizens because of their ideologies from being brainwashed by these Evangelical Satans they worship-.

What normal citizen would be in favor of Billionaires to have more and take from their neighbors and children.  Only the GOP tea scum.  You tea bags ARE THE STENCH OF THIS NATION

But unions and liberals SWEAR that those pension funds are self sustaining...  at least they would be if only they could raise taxes on the rich. If labias... er, I mean LIBERALS have their way, there won't be any more 'rich'. I wonder who will pay for all their social programs and entitlements then?

The article completely dances around what it is really talking about. The Public sector Union Lampreys have killed off the host organism(private sector) and now they have inadvertently killed off themselves because now there is no private sector host organism for them to suck there 8% a year growth off of. Socialism is very thorough and efficient in its ability to destroy everything and everybody. There are hardly any private sector pensions anymore. Going green means going broke.

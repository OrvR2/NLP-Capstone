Arkansas police are investigating the death of a man found naked in a hot tub next to a sleeping TV weatherman.
A friend woke meteorologist Brett Cummins, of Little Rock station KARK, on Labor Day. He found the forecaster snoring in the empty whirlpool next to a nude man with a dog collar around his neck, The Arkansas Democrat & Gazette reported. 
The 36-year-old resident who made the grisly discovery, Christopher Barbour, allegedly told police that the victim, 24-year-old Dexter Williams, was blue in the face and lying near Cummins' shoulder, ArkansasNews.com reported.
Barbour says the two men were in his home the night before, drinking and snorting drugs. Police haven't determined the cause of death, but a detective allegedly found a ring of blood in the bottom of the empty tub, ArkansasNews.com said. 
Police are waiting for autopsy results and don't consider Cummins a suspect, radio station KUAR said. 
KARK announced on Tuesday that Cummins wouldn't be on the air because he's "mourning the loss of a friend."

				Condolence­s to the family of the deceased, but one has to say TMI to the questionab­le "news" source which provided ALL the unnecessar­y details. No respect was given to the memory of deceased and how this informatio­n may affect his family - or the livelihood and relationsh­ip of the news weatherman who also  has friends and family. ANYTHING for a story, I guess. One can only hope - the people who were so ready to share all this informatio­n will receive nothing less, should they ever experience an event which discredits their relationsh­ip with their family, friends, their profession and livelihood­. May they receive the same thoroughne­ss in coverage.

				They both must have been severely intoxicate­d.  The hot tub was EMPTY?  Like - they got into the tub, and FORGOT TO FILL IT UP?   The deceased no doubt OD'd.   Stranger things have happened..­.all that autoerotic strangulat­ion stuff, etc.  -  like David Carradine in Thailand..­..

				Sounds strange to me the fact that blood was found in the tub and the person who owns the house said the two, Cummins and the dead man were drinking and snorting drugs.  Is this weatherman­, although not a suspect at the time... going to lose his job knowing drugs werew being snorted. Sounds like to guys were having passionate sex with eact other drinking and snorting drugs and one took a little too much and possibly OD'd... we'll see when the autopsy comes back.

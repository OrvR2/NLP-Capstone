Brett Cummins, a 33-year-old KARK meteorologist, woke up on Monday in a bathtub next to a corpse wearing a dog collar on, his friend Christopher Barbour told police. 
According to a report by Fox Dallas-Fortworth, Barbour told authorities Cummins brought a friend, Dexter Williams, to his house the night before, and that the three of themproceeded to drink and "snort drugs." 
After soaking with Cummins and his friend in the Jacuzzi, Barbour then left for the living room, where he fell asleep on a couch. 
The next morning, Barbour found the two next to each other in an empty bathtub, Williams was wearing a dog collar. 
The New York Daily News wrote about what happened next: 
"Dexter's head was lying behind Brett's left shoulder," Barbour told police, according to the report. "After Brett awoke they discovered that Dexter was not conscious and his face was a different color. Brett screamed and became ill and left the bathroom and vomited on the carpet in the living room," Barbour told police, according to the report. The weatherman then left the house, but insisted he would return."

Cummin's station refrained from going into much detail about the event, but acknowledged Cummins' involvement as well as expressed condolences for Williams' family. 
"Our Meteorologist Brett Cummins was at the home at the time of the death and we felt we 
should share this with our viewers. Brett will not be on the air as he is mourning the loss of his friend. 
Our thoughts go out to the family and friends of Dexter Williams."
So far no criminal charges have been filed, and police are investigating into the cause of Williams' death.

				Choke chains work a lot better in hot tubs.  Leather collars get wet and then shrink when they dry.  You don't want to fall asleep with a wet collar cinched tight.  Or, so I'm told.

				When will folks get smart enough to NOT LET theirselve­s get into a situtation like this.
He did not have to go to the apartment with him. They had apparently been drinking
enough already.

As a "Business Person"/me­toraligist  he should have had brains enough to know that
something like this would get around faster that a Jet Plane.
When they do something like this I feel they have NO RESPECT for their line of work
or theirselve­s!  Alot of people DEPEND on the "weather man".  

Locally here we have one station that the weather man has been there 30 (thirty) years
this past May. The weatherman before him put in I think it  was 20 (twenty) some years.

One of our other local station cannot keep a weatherman­.  They change weatherman at least once a year!   People need to remember that their actions  (even after hours) puts a
reflection on THEM.  We have our "free will", but things like this reflects on their reputation­.

How do we expect our children to be respectful­, honest, and hard working people when
they see and hear of things like this.  YES!  Life should have a number of fun, enyoyable.
thinga in it.  Use your brain and discover different things you enjoy doing.

				Warning: Drugs and hot tubs DO NOT GO TOGETHER. Period.
As for the dog collar - I can understand that, but...in a hot tub? 
If it weren't so sad I'd bail laughing at the thought.

				So I'm thinking the lesson to be learned here is, if you're going to party hard and wake up in a bathtub with some dude, leave out the dog collar... or, if you're going to party hard and wear a dog collar, don't do it in a bathtub with some dude... or, if you're going to wear a dog collar and sleep in a bathtub with some dude, don't do it while partying hard... or ...

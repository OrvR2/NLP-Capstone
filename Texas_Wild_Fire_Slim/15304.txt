Lion soccer completes sweep of Waxahachie
Lion soccer was better than the Indians in Waxahachie earlier this month, so why couldn’t Ennis repeat the feat on its home turf?

‘Leadership’ a valuable experience
Ennis is my third stop in my publishing career. The first, Farmerville, La., was in a town of 3,500 with a circulation of 4,100 — talk about penetrating the households of the community. We actually served a parish of 20,000 and were pretty much the only game in town. Everyone knew who we were, respected [...]

Get out and vote in the primaries
Primary elections are looming. It’s time to focus on narrowing down your list of candidates to those who most closely reflect your views and opinions about how the county, region and state should be led moving forward into the beginning of this new decade. We are on the cusp of major changes in Texas and [...]

Spotlight on … Aleta and Paul Penfold
The Penfold’s accents are an immediate giveaway — they aren’t from around here. But they fit right in. Michigan natives Paul and Aleta moved to Ennis two years ago, and since have been heavily involved in a few different clubs and organizations in the community. Aleta is a regular at the Ennis Literary Guild, both [...]

Lion powerlifters establish position for regionals
Competing on their home turf Thursday, several Lion powerlifters put themselves in position to qualify for next week’s Region 3 meet in Lindale. There will be powerlifting meets throughout the region on Saturday, and only then will these Lions know exactly where they ended up in the regional standings. With that being said, it appears [...]

No two days alike in this business
The experience that goes with this job is amazing. I don’t mean the typical occupational experience that comes from working in any field for a significant amount of time — though that is certainly a plus. Being a reporter is not just a career for me — it’s become a way of life. I have [...]

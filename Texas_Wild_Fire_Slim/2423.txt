Bombarded by sensationalistic weather reporting last weekend, many East-Coasters had no way of knowing that the stockpile of food, water and other supplies they rushed to buy in time for Hurricane Irene would better prepare them for a long Video Music Awards-viewing session. Luckily for Lady Gaga/Joe Calderone, however, millions of people ended up stranded in front of their televisions as they hurried to consume their newly-acquired Chef Boyardee supply (Though Irene did cause substantial damage in a number of areas).
With Labor Day on the horizon, the rest of the week seemed to churn by slowly -- but the jesters over at Someecards still found the energy to give us some laughs. We picked our favorite cards from the past week to send out over the long weekend -- vote for your favorite and send away!

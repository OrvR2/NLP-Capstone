BASTROP, Texas (AP) — Drawn to the quaint Central Texas town of Bastrop by the promise of life in a quiet, wooded area, Frank Davis moved into his new home two Saturdays ago. The next day, he and his wife evacuated when a monster wildfire moved in.Now, there's nothing left."The fire was so hot, there are even panes of glass that melted," said Davis, a 47-year-old home remodeler who came to Bastrop from Austin, about 30 miles away. "It's all gone."The number of homes destroyed by a still-raging wildfire here rose on Sunday to 1,554 and will increase further as emergency crews enter areas where the blaze has been extinguished. Seventeen people remain unaccounted for, but officials believe they could simply be out of town.Bastrop County officials joined by Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett sought to provide new information to hundreds of residents evacuated a week ago, when blustering wind whipped up by Tropical Storm Lee swept across parched, drought-stricken Texas — helping to spark more than 190 wildfires statewide that killed four people.The worst of the fires is the one in Bastrop that has consumed more than 34,000 acres.Crews have now contained more than 50 percent of the blaze, paving the way for people to begin returning home and trying to rebuild their lives from the remains of the smoldering rubble.For Davis, a first-time homebuyer who paid cash and moved in without insurance, that means living in a mobile home on his charred property while he rebuilds. In the meantime, he and his wife are staying with relatives."I do intend to stay," he said.Davis saw his property when a sympathetic police officer let him slip into an otherwise inaccessible area so he could catch a glimpse of his land.Others who were forced to evacuate have not yet had that opportunity. Many still don't know what became of their homes.Beginning Monday, county officials will begin allowing them to slowly re-enter scorched areas as authorities ensure the land has properly cooled and hotspots are extinguished. Some were given only minutes to evacuate as the raging blaze surrounded homes and neighborhoods. Some had time to gather a few important belongings, others fled with only the clothes on their back.George Helmke, 77, a retired Delta airlines gate agent, is scheduled to return home Thursday. Until then, a police roadblock some 150 yards from his property is preventing access — even though there is no fire damage."It's almost inhumane and I'm very frustrated," said Helmke, who said he has been unable to get heart and other medications from home. "These are expensive medications. I tell these folks that, but they just sort of brush you off," he said.Others are even more desperate.Tiffany and Bill Roberts started a Facebook page pairing families in need with those who want to help. Since Wednesday, more than 1,000 people have joined, and around 70 families have found sponsors who have helped them with everything from finding donated clothes and legal aid to securing a place to stay.Donation centers in Bastrop are so overwhelmed that they've stopped accepting clothing and other items. As a result, the Roberts have filled their lawn with donations: folding tables piled with everything from clothes to kitchen utensils to stuffed animals; dressers cluttered with lamps and other electronics standing next to piles of DVDs, VHS tapes and CDs.One evacuee hunted for a hairdryer. When she failed to find one in the items on the lawn, Roberts went to her own bathroom."I said 'give her ours, we don't use it,'" said the 40-year-old.Single-mother Latasha Payne and her five sons, ages 4 to 11, rummaged through the items looking for toys. The family hasn't been back home and doesn't know what's left — but the 31-year-old said two of her kids have severe asthma, so they will have to move anyway.A state voucher is allowing the family to stay in a hotel for free for a week. After that, Payne, a full-time college student, doesn't know what she will do."I really don't have a plan," she said, her voice cracking. "It's definitely going to be a fight tooth and nail for rental property."The federal government on Friday declared Texas a disaster area, paving the way for individuals to get financial aid. Congressman Doggett said families will be eligible for up to $30,000 to pay for expenses not covered by insurance policies, such as temporary housing and even construction costs."The $30,000 can only go so far toward the expenses that some of you have," Doggett said. "But I think it can be a lot of assistance."On Monday, schools will open for the first time since the Bastrop blaze erupted. So many people are living in the town's Super 8, Best Western and Holiday Inn that school buses will stop at all three.The monster blaze that has done the most damage to Bastrop resulted when two fires joined a week ago. Investigators won't know for several weeks what caused them, Pickering said. Some smaller fires that flared up since then could have been deliberately set, he said."We had reports from around the community of vehicles driving around that we suspect are starting fires," Pickering said. "I have no confirmation of that."North of Houston, meanwhile, firefighters say a tri-county blaze that has consumed more than 20,000 acres and destroyed nearly 60 homes is also half contained.__Weissert reported from Bastrop, Texas.

Republicans voted against helping the people of Texas! Better get Perry to pray more! Oh, he prayed for rain and got fire??? Get Perry to pray for fire!

Perry fiddles with his doomed presidential campaign while Texas burns.  Does that sound like Nero?

Perry isn't even in the state, and the Lieutenant Governor had to ask for aide.  He may not be responsible for the fires, but he is doing as little as he can for the people of his state.  He reminds me of Palin who abandoned Alaska when she found out she could make more money on the lecture circuit.  He's off campaigning.  These fires burning in Texas are a perfect learning experience for the American people, because if he is this cavalier with his state, imagine how he would be as President.

Are you good people of Texas forgetting that it was just a few weeks ago when Irene hit the East Coast, and the good people of Texas said that the flood victims shouldn't receive Federal aide, and that Texas takes care of itself.  Oh yeah, and it was nothing but media hype ordered by President Obama.  You were the first to draw blood making a natural disaster into a "political tool".  What goes around, comes around, and if you can't take it, don't dish it out.

I just want to go on record here as a life-long liberal who doesn't view of total loss of homes and life as a reason to attack a state or the citizens thereof. The governor of Texas is no more responsible for the tragedies hitting his state than was/is the governor of Vermont. My comment to those of you who are troubled by the anonymous hate and bitterness is to just ignore the tolls. People are free to be despicable on internet post sites and the rest of us are free to give them a thumbs down and move on.

I don't know how it works in your neck of the woods, but in ours, the volunteer fire departments are funded by the people they serve, not the city, state, or feds.   We have fish frys, pie suppers, ho downs, and just plain dropping by and giving them a thank you card with a few bucks and a case of water.   Some of our volunteers do grants to get new equipment, trucks and gear.   They do a hell of a job and we are proud of them.  We have about ten of them in a 40 mile area.   When your house is burning you can't wait for a politician to decide if helping you is good for his election.  Home owners insurance is cheap compared to rebuilding your home.  My shanty is over 100 years old, and would go up like paper, but it is fully insured in case a fire or tornado comes my way.   You gotta plan ahead folks.  My heart goes out to all of those who have lost homes, lives, loved ones, human and animal, and property.

As I recall, these asshat Texans laughed and cheered at Iraqis and Afghans dying and losing their homes
These same Texans claim to be good Christians who follow the teachings of their beloved Buybull

Well there's a line in that Buybull about doing unto others as you'd have others do unto you.
Presumably these Texans wnat us to laugh and cheer as they die and lose their homes

Way too  many video games and no yard work, That is the only way this was allowed to happen. Anyone every heard of clearing brush away from your homes. I'll bet money most of these people have not clean their yards in the last couple of years. I can almost garentee it, as I can see it will happen in some of the areas where I use to live. Too many lazy people.

Yes there are 25 million people in Texas and ALL of them belong to the GOP and are endorsing Perry so let's disregard the fact that 1500 families lost their livlihoods because they are ALL rebuplicans and deserved it! AND I'M A DEMOCRAT. I've seen more compassion from the taliban. Morons.

Everyone get out your violins and play them for those poor ol' Texans who believe that all people should be self-sufficient enough to handle their own natural disasters and don't want no gub'ment money..you know, those SAME people who said the people of Louisiana deserved what they got for not leaving and the same ol' Texans who laughed when Enron stole billions from California and the same ones who believe Texas should secede and the Slick Rick would be a good choice for Presiedent...Hey Texans..didn't you get the hint, ig God ignores Ricky, maybe you should too....

If I learned anything in life after having my house destroyed by Hurricane Floyd, it is to pay the premiums on your house insurance.  It is amazing how that $100 a month, really does make a difference in the long run, and can help you return to your life.

Shame on you people making fun of those who have lost everything they own in these fires. This is a tragedy! Prayers for those who are fighting these fires, those who have lost their homes, those who will be involved in helping clean up and rebuild after the fires are out and those with health issues caused from all the smoke.  Any may God have mercy on those saying such hateful things on here.

With all the hate speach about Texas and its politics I guess you people really show your true colors - natural disasters do not care about your political party affiliation.  You people are sick to use it as a political tool.  And you hate speech people want power in the white house??? WOW. Very, very sick and scary.  Guess you all need to go to Texas to help dig ash.

Oh yes, all of us Texans are just evil people and Perry is our evil leader! It is amazing how ignorant so many people that comment on stories are! Do you ever truly stop to think of how this is changing the lives of so many people? Are you so consumed with hate that you that you truly do not care about PEOPLE any more? It's amazing how so many that do not even live in Texas know everything there is to know about Texas! Do you know how Texas opened up it's state to the millions of people that fled Hurricane Katrina? Do you know that many of those people chose to stay in Texas? Did any of you ever see the Astrodome full of evacuees and the cars that lined up for MILES with people dropping off donations that were needed? This was for people that we did not know, that came from another state but yet, TEXAS had compassion for them!!! Have any of you seen the donations that have been given since the fires have started and the thousands of volunteers that are willing to share love and have sympathy for so many displaced people, trying to make them as comfortable as possible in the midst of this horrible nightmare they are having to live? It is so hard to believe that America is turning into such a hate filled country... My heart breaks for everyone that has lost everything or that has been evacuated and are not aware if they have anything left... No matter what political party they belong to, no matter if they are from Texas or else where, no matter their race, gender or religion.... I pray for strength and for their peace of mind....

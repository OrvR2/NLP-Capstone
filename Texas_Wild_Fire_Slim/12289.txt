AUCKLAND, New Zealand -- The president of the Pacific island nation of Kiribati is so worried about climate change wiping out his country that he's considering ideas as strange as building a floating island.
President Anote Tong raised the notion Wednesday on the opening day of a meeting of Pacific leaders in Auckland. Climate change has become a central theme of this year's Pacific Islands Forum thanks to the presence here of United Nations Secretary-General leader Ban Ki-moon, who has vowed to put the issue at the forefront of the U.N. agenda.
Ban visited the Solomon Islands and Kiribati before coming to New Zealand and said it only strengthened his view that "something is seriously wrong with our current model of economic development."
Tong said he'd seen models for a $2 billion floating island, which he likened to a giant offshore oil platform. He said while it sounded "like something from science fiction," every idea had to be considered given the dire situation facing Kiribati, a low-lying archipelago with a population of 103,000.
Other ideas to combat rising ocean levels include building a series of seawalls at a cost of nearly $1 billion, Tong said, and relocating some residents to other Pacific nations. But he said he couldn't imagine a day that Kiribati was abandoned.
"Would Kiribati disappear?" he said. "Never. Never."
Tong said some people have already lost their homes to rising sea levels. He said he's yet to see much in the way of financial aid from Europe despite ambitious pledges.
But in an interview with the Associated Press, European Commissioner for climate action Connie Hedegaard, who was attending the conference, said Europe has granted more than 7 billion euros for specific environmental projects around the world over the three years ending 2012.
"Climate change is not just a theoretical future. It is actually happening," Hedegaard said. "It is destabilizing areas of the world."
 Hedegaard said she's dismayed governments around the world haven't reached broad agreement on reducing carbon emissions. However, she said, she is heartened that many companies and municipalities are stepping in where governments are not – as much to save money on resources as for concern over the environment.
"I see a lot of good things happening out on the ground now," she said.
Hedegaard praised Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard's push to introduce a tax on carbon emissions. That plan will go to a vote next week.
Gillard, who has been facing political pressure at home and who has been criticized for her carbon-tax plans, told reporters Wednesday that she was sure the tax plan would pass because it has enough support among lawmakers.
The Pacific leaders leave for a retreat Thursday on Waiheke Island before the conference ends. Many leaders are staying on for the Rugby World Cup which begins here Friday.

				Yes, a floating island that makes perfect sense. Maybe he could get Gilligan and the Skipper to steer it. Will it have an anchor so it doesn't crash into other islands?  I'm sure Al Gore will fund a big sail for it so it could use wind power.

				Its not the climate change that is the problem. The earth itself is becoming warmer. The earth acts as a giant heat sink and its temperatur­e has risen 1 degree C because of the greenhouse effect. Given the size of the earth, that is a tremendous amout of energy. This is what feeds the weather.

				what's that one word that's always synonymous when the topic of global warming pops up? MONEY!! Kiribati, from an economic standpoint isn't even worth saving. It's one of the poorest nations on the globe & only has 100k inhabitant­s. It has no natural resources & their soil is terrible for agricultur­e. Since this will inevitably turn into a free for all for who can lobby for the most finance to save land area from the earth's natural changes, why not relocate these people into more inhabitabl­e areas instead of pumping money into worthless situations­? Whatever the cause of the sea rising in their particular area is irrelevant­, pragmatic decisions need to be made for long term solutions, not more wasteful spending..

				MOVE OVER MAD MAX, there's going be floating islands coming your way...trut­h is, ask any farmer, everything is getting warmer, seasons are changing, and as far as I can see, AL GORE was right, things are happening right by the book. Here in the desert of So Cal., we break records every week, Hot-cold-w­et=dry, never the norm..I'm a farmer, and we had snow in July? that was fun, brushing snow flakes off the plant leaves...A­nyway, there will be floating islands, and people should invest in wind and solar energy..Bu­t all those dang corrupt politicans that are bought and paid for by big oil, will never use free energy, they can't screw the people if their making their own, and not using the gov't life blood....

				These people certainly face serious challenges ahead... as do Vanuatu, the Marshall Islands... Tonga, Fiji... etc.  No one can stop the ocean from encroachin­g and drowning these islands.  At what point do they realise it may be futile to even try?  They can spend millions on ways to try to buy themselves some time, but one well aimed powerful hurricane could easily wipe out any constructi­on projects they come up with.  In the end how many millions of people will end up displaced without a country to call home?

				I live on an island off the coast of SC and have a beach front property. Been here many years. The high water mark is exactly where is was the day we moved in. Had to many people parking on the road in front of our yard and walking across our lawn and to the beach. Then they would drink and leave their mess for us. So I fenced off our property. Can't fence the beach but the law says I own to the high water line. Funny, it hasn't moved and I haven't moved the fence.

				Because what happens in front of your house is what happens everywhere­.

Also, from North Carolina..­.

"Since then, sea level has risen at an average rate of 2.1 mm/y, representi­ng the steepest century-sc­ale increase of the past two millennia. This rate was initiated between AD 1865 and 1892".

				It is a fact that the sea level is rising. People can say it is subjective to link that with man made GW... But no one can deny that we converted over 100 CUBIC miles of fossil fuels into CO2, an infrared absorber..­. It re-emits at same IR wavelength at any random direction. The more CO2, the more IR will get intercepte­d and redirected back home, to our oceans, our as-faults.­..
Anybody who does not like the idea of facing the truth of GW (or climate change, whatever), ought to know that they are only supporting a fossil fueled depletion.
We do not have to accept Al's tax as a solution because it is not. We have to accept trade tariffs as a solution..­. to keep the economy going, and then build ROBOTIC solar panel and battery facttories­.
Why robotic?
Because only machines can work for free 24/7.
Why do I advocate the taking away of RE jobs by machines?
Because that is the ONLY way we could ever have a surplus of installati­on jobs for people.
Imagine that... Machines that create 500,000 sq miles of install jobs!

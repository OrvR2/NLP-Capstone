Twin suicide blasts kill 23 people in PakistanBy ABDUL SATTAR - Associated Press | AP – 18 hrs ago

QUETTA, Pakistan (AP) — A pair of suicide bombers killed 22 people while targeting a top army officer in southwest Pakistan on Wednesday, missing him and killing his wife, several guards, a senior officer and two children, officials said.Police said they were investigating whether the strike in the city of Quetta was revenge for the recent arrests there of three top al-Qaida suspects, an operation assisted by the CIA.The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, but a spokesman for the group did not mention the arrests.Instead, he said Brig. Khurram Shahzad, the deputy head of the region's Frontier Corps, was targeted because of an incident several months ago that left five people dead at a checkpoint in the city.In Wednesday's blasts, the first attacker detonated his vehicle next to a group of Frontier Corps officers close to Shahzad's house. Hurling grenades, the second attacker then stormed the house and blew himself up inside, police officer Naseer Ahmed Kurd said.Police officer Hamid Shakil said at least 23 people were killed and more than 80 were injured, some critically.An unidentified 5-year-old girl who security personnel had carried from the scene, bloodied, some of her clothes torn from her body, later died at a government hospital, according to doctor Mohammed Jafar Kakar.The child was in a rickshaw, with her parents who also died in the attack, he said. Another child was also killed in the blast, along with a colonel in the corps.Shakil said one of the suicide bombers was carrying an identity card showing him to be a 21-year-old Afghan refugee.The bombing followed Monday's disclosure of the arrests of the three al-Qaida suspects in Quetta. The Pakistan army statement announcing it stressed the level of CIA involvement — a possible sign of an upswing in cooperation between two uneasy anti-terror allies after the rancor surrounding the killing of Osama bin Laden in a unilateral U.S. operation.American officials praised the arrest operation, saying the detention of the most senior militant — Younis al-Mauritani — was a significant achievement. The Frontier Corps took part."This attack was maybe in reaction to the recent arrests, but we are investigating," police officer Shakil said of the Wednesday blasts.Islamist militants are seeking to topple Pakistan's Western-allied leaders.Allied to the insurgents fighting U.S. forces across the border in Afghanistan, the militants have attacked hundreds of government, police, army and civilian targets since 2007, when the violence began in earnest. Many thousands have been killed, and Pakistani authorities have struggled to counter the threat.Quetta is a dangerous city, thought to be home to al-Qaida and Taliban leaders. It lies close to the border with southern Afghanistan, the heart of the insurgency in that country. It is also wracked by separatist violence, but those rebels have not tended to deploy suicide bombers.Pakistan didn't say when al-Mauritani and the two other al-Qaida operatives were arrested. But a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, has said the arrests took place in the past two weeks.The unusual announcement about the cooperation between the CIA and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency appeared aimed at reversing the widespread perception that ties were badly damaged by bin Laden's killing.The Pakistanis accused the Americans of violating their sovereignty with the bin Laden raid, while Washington was angry the terror leader was found in a house in a military garrison town in Pakistan.U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Tuesday praised Pakistan for al-Mauritani's arrest."It's a tribute to the Pakistanis, who worked with us on this effort to be able to go after him," Panetta told reporters, adding that he assumes the U.S. will ask the Pakistani authorities for permission to interrogate him.__AP National Security Writer Robert Burns contributed to this report.

I'm a born American, but my heart dances and sings when American troops die, I stand for freedom and liberty, and those are the foundations of America. Why does my heart sing:, because I know when US soldiers die evil is being crushed.
Afghans are the true brave freedom fighters, fighting for their homeland. while the American soldiers are the true cowards hiding behind their drones and aircraft and killing innocent civilians. Long live Afghan Insurgency, death to American troops !!!!! I love America, but It is a disgrace to be an american with all these atrocities being committed by our ruthless coward soldiers, and gay politicians who force them to commit genocide of innocent women and children

My neighbor in Manhattan New York, is an ugly white American Lady who goes to the extent of having sex with her Dog. I asked her why she does it. She just says this is America and in America freedom is the 'name of the game'. Is this what we call freedom, how degrading. But she doesn't feel ashamed, and went on to describe how she drops on all fours and her Alsatian dog mounts her from the rear., and they make love for hours.
Now you tell me ain't that degrading, we Americans are real dogs, and no nation can compete with us in evil. I went on to ask her if her husband condoned the act, and to my surprise she uttered "He's very co-operative, in fact he makes my videos while I perform with doggy". Out of curiousity I asked her "doesn't your husband become bored when doggy bangs you for hours, and to my utter dismay she replied "No dear, he's never bored , actually we have a goat in the back yard, and my husband mounts the goat, and they make love once in a while, after that I had to guess that she makes the videos while her hubby performs with the goat, and I was right. Man now you tell me ain't that sickening, If there is anything I've regretted in Life, it's being American, it's really taking a toll on my life, damit. If it wasn't for my American wife I would have left this hell hole long ago.

Islam is being misinterpreted again Islam does not support violence terrorism or bloodshed its a conspiracy of the media that they only highlight these troublesome Muslims Almighty Allah says in Glorious Quran "Fight against those who fight against you in the way of Allah, but do not transgress, for Allah does not love transgressors" Allah also says"Allah forbids you not those who warred not against you on account of religion (Al-Deen) and drove you not out from your homes, that you should show them kindness and deal justly with them. Lo! Allah loves the just dealers." (9) Allah forbids you only those who warred against you on account of religion (Al-Deen) and have driven you out from your homes and helped to drive you out, that you make friends of them. Whosoever makes friends of them such are wrong-doers."[Noble Quran 60:8-9]  our beloved Prophet Muhammad (Peace be Upon Him) said ‎"Muslims are brothers to one another. They should neither cheat, lie, nor humiliate each other." He (Peace Be Upon Him) asks us not to cheat or lie to any Muslims so think killing a Muslim is very very sinful..He (Peace be Upon Him) also said, "A believer continues to guard his Faith (and thus hopes for Allah's Mercy) so long as he does not shed blood unjustly".From these two teachings of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (Peace be Upon Him) we understand that Islam hates bloodshed terrorism and violence..Fighting is only permitted for SELF DEFENSE not to harm someone

i guess American drone killing 700 civilian in Pakistan just in 2009 in an act of humanity. Killing more then 1 million in Iraq is an act of Islam. killing 1000s and 1000s in Afghanistan is an act of Muslims..............Blaming Islam or Muslim as whole for the actions of few shows how stupid and uneducated you are. I suggest every one of you to start reading foreign media too, so you judge better.

Someone please explain to me what these Muslim terrorists do after they get to paradise and use up all of the 72 virgins.  Do they have to pace themselves so these virgins last for eternity?  Do these guys have some secret way of "repairing" virginity once it is lost or since this is paradise is the virginity never lost in the first place? I'm sure some imam can explain this. All this may be paradise for the men but I bet it's hell for the virgins!

According to AP reporters, the investigators should be looking at the Christians, Buddish, and Hindu since looking at Islamic organizations is racial profiling.

Islam terriorists are supported by Islam organizations.  Maybe not all Muslims are violent but all Muslims teach their children superiority, oppression, and killing in the name of god.

Because infidels are inferior to Muslims it is a far worse crime for you to criticize Islam than for Muslims to brutally murder each other. Your superiors can behave in the most vile manner, but if you point it out, you are to be killed.

Muslims are killing Muslims and blowing up mosques (full of Korans) all day every day and your average "moderate" Muslim could care less. BUT, if an infidel steps on a Muslims foot, the whole Islamic world riots.

How cruel one can be to have such hateful views and comments, all  I see is, they are the ones who are getting killed, everyday.
This has nothing to do with religion, this is a very filthy political game, in which only innocent loose.,I can bet if one can find who the victims are, they will be only ordinary people.

With this being a daily event, how is their population? I would think it would have to be declining.
I can't imagine any woman with even one brain cell bringing a child into that hell, they should stop procreating until they become civilized, which would probably be never.

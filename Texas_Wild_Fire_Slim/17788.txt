Font Size: 








MAGNOLIA (September 8, 2011)--The Magnolia Independent School District says classes were called off again Thursday because of wildfires and smoky conditions.
A shelter operating at Magnolia High School has been moved to Wildwood Methodist Church, where the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office says nearly 75 people spent Wednesday night.







The Houston Fire Department issued a statement Thursday morning saying that a "thick blanket of smoke and haze" covering the Houston area was from wildfires burning near Magnolia.
The sheriff's office says wildfires in Montgomery, Grimes and Waller counties have burned more than 12,500 acres.

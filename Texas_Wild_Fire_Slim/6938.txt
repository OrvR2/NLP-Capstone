WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A mother in Malaysia greeted her dead son. People in Manila left roses for the victim who helped give them homes. And mourners in Tokyo stood before a piece of steel from Ground Zero, remembering the 23 bank employees who never made it out alive.A decade after 9/11, the day that changed so much for so many people, the world's leaders and citizens paused to reflect Sunday.From Sydney to Paris, formal ceremonies paid tribute to the nearly 3,000 who perished from more than 90 countries. And, in a reminder that threats remain, Swedish police said four people were arrested Sunday on suspicion of preparing a terror attack as authorities in Washington and New York beefed up security in response to intelligence about possible plans for a car bomb attack.For some people, the pain never stops. In Malaysia, Pathmawathy Navaratnam woke up Sunday in her suburban Kuala Lumpur home and did what she's done every day for the past decade: wish her son "Good morning." Vijayashanker Paramsothy, a 23-year-old financial analyst, was killed in the attacks on New York."He is my sunshine. He has lived life to the fullest, but I can't accept that he is not here anymore," said Navaratnam. "I am still living, but I am dead inside."In Manila, dozens of former shanty dwellers offered roses, balloons and prayers for another 9/11 victim, American citizen Marie Rose Abad. The neighborhood used to be a shantytown that reeked of garbage. But in 2004, Abad's Filipino-American husband Rudy built 50 brightly colored homes, fulfilling his late wife's wish to help impoverished Filipinos.The village has since been named after her."It's like a new life sprang from the death of Marie Rose and so many others," said villager Nancy Waminal.Among the Sept. 11 victims was Indian Jupiter Yambem, who was manager at the "Roof of the World" restaurant in the World Trade Center.About 100 family members and close friends gathered at his ancestral home in the northeastern state of Manipur for prayers Sunday."Now that Osama bin Laden is dead, my brother's soul will finally rest in peace," Jupiter's older brother, Yambem Laba, said. "Osama is dead but the threat from al-Qaida has not ended."Players from the American Eagles rugby team were among the first to mark the anniversary at a memorial service in the town of New Plymouth in New Zealand. The players, who are participating in the Rugby World Cup tournament, listened to a speech by U.S. ambassador David Huebner, whose brother Rick survived the attacks on the World Trade Center."We watched live on television the brutal murder of 3,000 individuals," Huebner said. "We reacted with near unanimous horror and sadness.""As we mark the 10th anniversary of that day, we commemorate the triumph of human kindness, and the humanity and self-abrogation which sets us apart from every other species on this planet Earth."In Japan, families gathered in Tokyo to pay their respects to the 23 Fuji Bank employees who never made it out of their World Trade Center office. A dozen of the workers who died were Japanese.One by one, family members laid flowers in front of an enclosed glass case containing a small section of steel retrieved from Ground Zero. They clasped their hands and bowed their heads. Some took pictures. Others simply stood in solemn silence. There were no tears, just reflection.Kunitake Nomura, 76, a former Fuji Bank employee who mourns losing his younger co-workers, attended a subsequent memorial service."We need to try to understand each other," Nomura said. "We need to overcome differences in race and religion and learn to live in peace. We are all brothers after all. We must remind ourselves of this today."Sydney resident Rae Tompsett, 81, said she's never felt angry over the murder of her son Stephen Tompsett, 39, a computer engineer who was on the 106th floor of the World Trade Center's north tower when it was hit by a hijacked plane."No, not anger," she said. "Sorrow. Sorrow that the people who did this believed they were doing something good."The retired school teacher and her husband Jack, 92, were among more than 1,000 people who packed Sydney's Roman Catholic cathedral St. Marys for a special multi-faith service."It's incredible that it is 10 years — it feels a bit like yesterday," Tompsett said.South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak sent a letter to U.S. President Barack Obama, conveying his "deepest condolences" to the victims of the 9/11 tragedy, their bereaved families and the American public. Lee, whose country is one of the strongest allies of the United States, called the attacks "unpardonable" and praised decade-long U.S. efforts to fight terrorism.And leaders in Pakistan, which has been a victim of al-Qaida terrorism but is also accused of not doing enough to crack down on militants, said they joined the people of the U.S. in honoring the memory of those killed 10 years ago."As a country that has been severely affected by terrorism, we reaffirm our national resolve to strengthening international cooperation for the elimination of terrorism," the foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.Meanwhile, authorities in New York and Washington are increasing security for their 9/11 memorial services after intelligence agents got a tip that three al-Qaida members could be planning to set off a car bomb in one of the cities. Officials have found no evidence any terrorists have sneaked into the country.The Sept. 11 attacks "could easily have happened in Paris, it could easily have happened in Sydney and it could still happen which is why the price of freedom is eternal vigilance," Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said after laying a wreath at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.The Taliban marked the anniversary by vowing to keep fighting against U.S. forces in Afghanistan and saying they had no role in the Sept. 11 attacks."Each year, 9/11 reminds the Afghans of an event in which they had no role whatsoever," a statement e-mailed to news organizations said. "American colonialism shed the blood of tens of thousands of miserable and innocent Afghans."Hours later, a Taliban suicide bomber in a large truck blew it up at the gate of a NATO combat outpost in eastern Afghanistan, killing two civilians and injuring others.The U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan on Oct. 7, 2001, after the Taliban who then ruled the country refused to hand over Sept. 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden. The al-Qaida leader was at the time living in Afghanistan, where the terror network retained training camps and planned attacks against the U.S. and other countries. Bin Laden was killed four months ago at his Pakistan hideout by U.S. forces.____Associated Press writers Rod McGuirk in Australia, Eileen Ng in Malaysia, Jim Gomez in the Philippines and Tomoko Hosaka in Japan contributed.

Reading some of these posts makes me sad. I'd hoped we'd come further in the past ten years. This Anti-Muslim sentiment has to end. Not all Muslims endorse terrorism, just like not all Irish Catholics or Protestants endorse terrorism. It makes no sense to just an entire group of religious people based on what a few think. Should all Christians still be judged for the Crusades? You know, those long wars way back when where European Christians invaded other people's lands, made their streets run red with blood...all in the name of God? 

Btw, there were muslims in the those buildings when the planes hit. There were muslims in those buildings when they collapsed.

Few years ago there was a film that tried to de-bunk 9-11 conspricqay theorists.In that film they claimed that wtc 7 fell due to diesel generators that exploded.Since then now they claim the fire caused it and no mention of the diesal is on the report--lmao you know why?--because diesael doest explode nore was any stored on the floors which they clamied in the report. the report was so ridiculous they had to scrape it and walk away from any and all excuses.--i worked on the 92nd florr of wtc in the 80's--i know how far away building 7 was--no way a fire could jump way over to there but it did--all of silversteins properties fell that day but no other buildings that were closer did not!!

I agree it should be a national rememberance day, because the day we stop remembering what happened we cease to be human. My heart goes out to all the families of those murdered by the terrorists, who truly are evil in believing they have done something good.

Come on Yahoo, report how many people like me who remember Many people whose families died on 911 have repeatedly castigated the Bush Administration for their behavior. The tragedy was used by them as a cassus belli allowing them to engage in two illegal wars against countries that did not attack us. Using our deaths and an excuse for our war is really upseting the majority. Not going to work for motivation 10 years later...Nice try

Hmmmm.......I always wondered why we never observed April 19 in this manner.   Remember that day?  4/19.....Anybody?  Anybody?

Back in 1995, the nation suffered what was then the worst act of terrorism on American soil at the hands of Timothy McVeigh, neo-con posterboy, and quite possibly the inspiration for the Tea Party Movement.  (Yup, nothing says; "Take back America", like blowing up some goldurn Feds with a truckload of fertilizer!)

Let's set aside our differences at least for one day and pay respect to those who lost their lives on 9/11/2001. 

Can't we all just get along? o.O

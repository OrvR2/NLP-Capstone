Drummer boy loses instruments, not hopeBastrop student hopes music will unite communityUpdated: Monday, 12 Sep 2011, 10:03 PM CDTPublished : Monday, 12 Sep 2011, 8:44 PM CDT

BASTROP, Texas (KXAN) - The long road to recovery is beginning to take shape in Bastrop. One of the first events the town will get to take part in together will be Thursday's football game at the high school, and no one is looking forward to that day more than freshman Hayden Wade.  The pint-sized percussionist performs like a seasoned veteran. He says he was born ready to play.  "I was born with a pair of drum sticks in my hand," said Wade.  This music prodigy plays the drums, the piano and the guitar and while his band instrument was tucked safely away at the school, all of his personal instruments were lost in the blaze that destroyed his home. He recalls the moment he realized they were gone.  "Well, I thought of my instruments and I felt empty because my dad got those for me on my 7th birthday. I don’t know, just a big part of me was missing," said Wade.  He hasn't had a chance to play until now. School started back up on Monday and today was his very first band practice. Wade said he is looking forward to his first home game, "I think it is going to be pretty ecstatic. I like to march on the football field with thousands of people watching me do what I do best."  The classic rock fan says the saying "he marches to the beat of a different drummer" applies to him well. He says music is his life and his joy; he just hopes his performance on Thursday brings joys to the many in his town who are suffering right now.  "It is the first time that people will have gotten together and do something that didn’t involve the fire. We can rebuild our social life." If you can't make it to the game on Thursday night, you can catch it on our sister station KBVO. It is the game of the week.

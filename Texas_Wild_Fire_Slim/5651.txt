More Republicans skipping Obama’s jobs speechBy Chris MoodyPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody | The Ticket – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

Rep. Paul Broun (Gregory Smith/AP)When President Obama delivers his address on a new job-creation plan to a joint session of Congress on Thursday, he won't be speaking to a sold-out crowd. Several lawmakers are still determining whether it is worth their time to stay in Washington to hear the president, and some are already planning to skip it.
Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter is the latest to announce that he will not be there, choosing to attend a party to watch the New Orleans Saints' opening football game instead.
"As a fanatic, I have my priorities," Vitter told Fox News on Wednesday.
Republican Rep. Paul Broun of Georgia will also skip the address but will watch it from his office across the street. During the speech, Broun will post his comments about Obama's remarks on Twitter, a tradition he keeps during State of the Union addresses.
"Dr. Broun will not be attending President  Obama's joint address, but he looks forward to hearing the president's  proposal for job creation," Broun spokeswoman Meredith Griffanti told The Ticket. "Dr. Broun will instead watch the speech  from his office where he will host a live town hall via Twitter to  interact with his constituents."
Broun remained in his office during Obama's State of the Union address in January, providing his own commentary on the social networking website throughout the speech.
"Mr. President, you don't believe in the Constitution. You believe in socialism," one of Broun's tweets read. 
Illinois Republican Rep. Joe Walsh was the first to announce his intentional absence last week, saying he didn't want to act as a "prop" for Obama's speech.
South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, a member of the Senate Tea Party Caucus, told Jon Karl of ABC News that he "probably" won't show up either.
"If he sent a written proposal over first, I would go hear him explain  it, but frankly right now I'm so frustrated I don't think I'm going to  go," DeMint told ABC News. "I can't imagine too many Americans wanting to hear another speech with no real plan attached."
There's also a chance that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio won't be there, but his absence would have nothing to do with politics: Rubio's mother has fallen ill after suffering a series of recent strokes. The freshman senator's schedule this week is "fluid" because of his mother's health, a spokesman from Rubio's office said.

Really? So now members of the GOP and Tea Party won't attend a speech by the President of the United States? Why did I vote to send you people to the hill? I am actually tired of this to the point where I and every American will have to do something drastic about this. If the GOP and Tea Party want to be obstructionist, then do it on someone else's dime. I sent you people to Washington to fix things and all I see is fighting and self grandizing. You might not respect the man; however, you will respect the office of the President of the United States of America. That position was filled by the people of this country, all of us. Most of you were put into office by your own state. You do the math. The President is the leader, it seems that either you forgot or never understood that concept. Either way, we, the people, will have to fix this problem during the next election cycle. State by state. One Congressional seat at a time.

Obama delayed his speech a day at a request from Boener. He is not going to propose anything outlandish. Why is he so accomadating to the Republicans.... For the good of the country.  Remember who has the lowest approval ratings.So Vitter's priorities is football? I bet there will be #$%$ there too

If anyone can say that these racists who are not even going to listen to the President, members of Congress, are looking out for the ordinary citizen of this country, then you are not taking yourself seriously. They have no respect for a Black man so this means that they too have none for the President, who happens to be Black. They are telling us that no matter what the president says, they are going to be against him. They have no thoughts about working together for the best of the country! The President has to just treat them like they do him! I realize that he has to be nice, but he should be mean sometimes too. These racists are not going to change their minds about working with Obama, so I would get what I could get passed and just veto anything the Repubs and Tea Party nuts come up with. They do not care about the country, no patriotism, just keeping the President from moving the country in the right direction. Racism at its WORST!!

They have showed their ignorance by not intending to go and hear and see the president talk about jobs, remember the gop were  gong to get jobs   , where are they /  probably overseas with all the money that should be right here in America  , set a tarrif on anything the overseas jobs sell and make it so high they will be dying to foot the taxes that they have been excused from paying by the republicans and left it all on the middle class to pay,  when you have a republican congress , president or senate  the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  Listening to all the ps. talk i have become immune to their running down of the president, their lack of respect for the office and their talk about cutting services. Oconnor should try and get a heart, he is not going to help people ravaged by the hurricanes untill he gets  cuts, i hope his mother hears him and lets him know he isnt fit to clean  shoes and maybe his wife family etc. listen to this (man)? and know what not to do, he is one real doozie.  this kind of treatment of people cause them to get very invigorated and things happen, i am sure they do not want the uprising of a whole nation because of their lack of decency. they need schooling on humanity and the treating of people in general.. they should be governing  not whining.

If it matters to you, remember I told you this:  Obama's hyped up long awaited "jobs" speech will be long on BS and short on substance.  Moreover, his scheme to eliminate tax loopholes for corporations and to tax the wealthy (to make the jobs plan revenue neutral) will NOT pass the House of Representatives.  Thus, "THE PLAN" is useless.  More of the same from this inept administration.

Our country truly needs a change from those who do not act in the best of the people. I hope voters really come out in force to be heard! Even kindergartens learn to play well in groups. The lies and half truths these political figures spew should be illegal along with the so called news channels.

To those members that we elected to represent us, I am appauled at the blatant disrespect you show our leader, President Obama.  I say we send a letter to these 'voted' members of office and let them know what a bad example they are sending out. as they well know, every vote counts and when it comes election time, I wonder if I will be watching my favorite program because I have my priorties!

That's funny, Obama and his chosen Maoist czars, are seeking State Capitalism here in America.  Many compromised Democrats are clamoring for “change” into a quasi Socialist/Marxist/Islamofascist Hybrid State to replace/supplant American Capitalism. 

The Chinese wealthy wanting to leave China's oppression and liberty bondage, need to heed a quote from Obama's selected Marxist Czar Van Jones’s book; Strike the establishment pose to achieve the radical end goals. 

The progressive left (liberal; pose change) today in America have played the covert words of Obama and His obamanite hordes in perfect harmony as outlined in Saul Alinsky hatred of the American system as established by Her founding fathers.  This cancerous malignancy today has spread throughout the entire body of American society; religion, education, economy, government, even to the presidency.  

The "change" Obama covertly (pose) ran on, but never outlined or held responsible too; transparency on cspan joke), is about complete, and the only thing left in the way is American Patriots.  Obama's comrade, and community organizer colleague, the progressive leftist highly venerated Marxist anarchist to destroy America weather underground leader Bill Ayers organization said in the 1960's 25,000,000 Americans would need to die to achieve this end goal.  This makes for an interesting scenario, when we consider the American union leaders, controlled by Obama, are working with the Communist and Muslim "democracy" movements around the world, connecting through Obama's goggle VP Muslim friend to destabilize the middle east. What really stirs the curiosity, the Muslim Brotherhood at the point of all the progressive movements, even accommodating Marxism and Islamofascists, "social justice,"; pose, to unite, listed in their book 25,000,000 Americans need to die in order to make America Shirah compliant.   

When I consider these things at work in America and around the world today, I truly believe, even though "I do not" side with one of Obama's Union Leader's recent comments to kill the Tea Party, I can appreciate his frankness in drawing the line where by members on both sides may prepare themselves for the bloody 2012.        

My advice to the Chinese wealthy, ride it out a little longer... State Capitalism will come to you. 

Even so, come Lord Jesus.  amen

p.s. Bill Ayers words today:  I do not apologize for my actions with the weather underground, my only regret is I didn't do more...

I am so tried of the Republican GOP.  They are disrespectful of the current government and President of this country.  They did not disrespect  Bush who created this mess and they helped too.  So stop being a Ahole a start being and elected offical that we put there.  And keep that stupid woman Pay who from talking.

When we will they learn to respect people for who they are.  Remember, he had the largest turn out for election ever in this country.  Republican remember who put you there can take you out of there.  Remember the power of votes.  You represent the people of this country.

You show how much racism is alive in the this country just by your action toward the President of the United States of America

Shame on you  Republicans, Tea Party(who just appear since we have for a Black man for President).  Mrs. Palin can not  take care of her out of control family .  So, how can she take care of a government.  she resigned as Govern of Alaska and did not complete the full term.

Those who think they should show up and listen,  please keep speaking the truth.  I'm a Republican (traditional conservative) and I'm so ashamed of what my party has become. I'll be voting democrat from now on, I think. At least my "new" party finally opened my eyes to what the Republican party really stands for...large corporations only.  Both political parties are "bought" by their big election campaign donors...large corporations and the top 2%  of wealty citizens.

Funny thing is that many of these people who hate Obama actually think the Republican Party cares about their views. The Democrat Party is becoming the same way too, just at a little slower rate.  All they really want are their votes. I found out this out by expressing concerns about issues to both Florida Congressman Southerland and Florida Senator Rubio. I only received form letter type replies spouting the thoughts of those who own them...large corporations. Not a word about the specific concern(s) that I had sent to them. I can only hope more people will realize what is happening here and will vote pnly for those who do try to represent them, regardless of party. 

We, so far, are not slaves to any man, business, or political party. I certainly won't vote for anyone who would like to see us become their slaves. First, and foremost, we are all Americans. We better wake up soon and get the large corporations and wealthiest people out of election campaign funding or we will become a Plutocracy...where the rich rule and elections are not really necessary. We are almost there already. This undue influence of campaign funding applies to both parties, but it's more rampant in my Republican party for now. 

However, Senator Bernie Sanders made remarks on MSNBC this week about the Democrats being split on whether to support SS because some are worried about their campaign funding checks. Even the Koch bothers say they do donate money to a few Democrats...bet those are the ones who are afraid to support SS.

We must all stand together to remove all private money from election capaigns before it is too late. Dylan Rattigan, MSNBC, is havng an amendment written by constitutional experts to remove all private money from election campaigns, including Super Pacs. It should be ready to read on-line in next month or so.  Dylan is fed up with both parties and the fact that they refuse to fix the root causes of our economic problems or to prosecute those who are repsonsible.  He knows that all our politicians are "bought" by large corporations and the wealthiest 2% of our people. He is spending his own money to try to change this.

Let's help him make this a big issue in 2012 elections and see who will back it. It already has the support of a couple of former and current serving state and national leaders who also tell us that "now" is the best time in our history to make this happen. Americans are actually seeing what the large corporations and wealthiest 2% are doing to jobs, tax laws, trade agreements, and everything else that we, the people, USED to have some controll over. 

Even the three newest trade agreements with Korea, Columbia, and Panama  up for approval this month are reported to actually cost us about 200,000 more jobs instead of creating new jobs.  They must be amended before it is approved.  Florida Congressman Southerland replied to my concerns over this issue with a letter saying he supports free trade and that he plans to vote to approve these three new ones.  He never answered my concern over job loss.  That tells me that he knows it will cost jobs, but his campaign donors want these trade agreements approved.  Even President Obama wants them approved so it is both parties who are influenced too much by their wealthy campaign donors. Republicans bow to their money masters the most, so far, but the Dems are not far behind.  We, the people, must work together to stop this theft of our right to be represented!   Then we can start bickering again.

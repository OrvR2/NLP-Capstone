Education and technical assistance are the foundations of the BMP program.  Project staff use creative methods to reach countless people, including news releases, interviews, radio public service announcements, and highway billboards.  Other methods include conducting informative seminars with county landowner associations and providing one-on-one technical assistance to the forestry community on BMPs.  This project also coordinates BMP training workshops for loggers in cooperation with the Texas Forestry Association (TFA) and Texas Logging Council (TLC).  These workshops were started in 1995 and have since reached over 3,000 people through 110 workshops.  In January 2005, an online BMP refresher course for loggers was released.  Continuing effective educational programs and providing technical assistance to the forestry community is the best way to mitigate any potential impacts to water quality from forestry operations.

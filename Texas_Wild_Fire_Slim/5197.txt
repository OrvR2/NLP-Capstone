Michele Bachmann wins, Ron Paul a close second at Iowa straw pollBy Holly BaileySenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey | The Ticket – Sat, Aug 13, 2011

Michele Bachmann and her husband, Marcus, in Ames (Chip Somodevilla/AP)Michele Bachmann claimed a narrow victory over Ron Paul in Iowa's GOP presidential straw poll on Saturday, becoming the first woman to ever win the famed contest.
With nearly 17,000 votes cast, the Minnesota congresswoman received 4,823 votes in Ames--narrowly beating Paul by just 152 votes.
Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty finished in third place, with 2,293 votes--a disappointing finish for the 2012 hopeful who was counting on a good showing to give some much needed momentum to his campaign.
Still, Pawlenty offered no signs that he is thinking about quitting the race, citing his third place finish as "progress." "We are just beginning and I'm looking forward to a great campaign," Pawlenty said in a statement.
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum finished in fourth place, with 1,657 votes, followed by Herman Cain (1,456); Mitt Romney (567); Newt Gingrich (385); Jon Huntsman (69) and Thaddeaus McCotter (35).
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, whose name was not included on the ballot, received 718 write-in votes--more than Romney, who (along with Huntsman) didn't formally participate in the event. Earlier today, Perry officially announced his candidacy in South Carolina, at roughly the same time straw poll attendees began casting their votes in Iowa.
While there has been some debate about whether the Ames contest truly matters, the Iowa straw poll is widely considered one of the early tests of a candidate's organizational strength and support in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. One potential sign of enthusiasm from GOP caucus-goers about the 2012 race: More votes were cast this year than the roughly 14,000 cast in the same contest four years ago--a year that the declared frontrunner (Romney) actually participated. It was the second biggest turnout in the event's history.
The results are likely to put pressure on candidates who didn't do well--including Gingrich, who couldn't afford to reserve space at the event but still showed up to mingle with straw poll attendees. His campaign offered no immediate comment on the poll's results.
Santorum, another candidate who had a disappointing finish, insisted he has no plans to quit the race--telling MSNBC in an interview his votes were pretty high considering he hasn't received as much media attention as other candidates.
While Bachmann's win is a win, her slim margin of victory might not give her the momentum she was looking for in her quest to be considered the race's chief alternative to Romney. The danger for her candidacy is that she's competing for much of the same support as Perry, whose 2012 announcement dominated political headlines for much of the day.
She and Perry are set to cross paths for the first time Sunday--both are set to appear a fundraising dinner in Waterloo, Iowa.

People against morons
Yesterday

Let's be realistic and honest.  Assuming for the sake of discussion Paul is the best person for the job.  Until he cuts his ties with the fringe supports such as Alex Jones he wil lnever be taken serioius.  The general population will always shyfrom and be afraid of a candidate who is associated this people who speak of The New World Order, FEMA Camps to enslave the masses, 9-11 being an inside job, Poison in vaccines, police are jack booted thugs etc. I live in Austoin 90% of what Jones says is a gross fabrication.  This is what the voting public sees, Dr Paul supported by a radical 3rd rate talk show host calling for a revolution, including violence.  Do I think Dr. Paul would be a good president, maybe but until he distances himself from the lunatic fringe the public, for right or wrong, will judge him by the company he keeps.

Bachmann, I don't what planet you came from, but I know there is a black hole waiting for your a** to return, cause you are WAY too far out there, b*i*a*t*c*h. Any self-respecting woman would send your a** back to the dark ages where you can be stoned for being divorced, cause Marcus ain't gonna last long there!

If you are going to vote for the big wigs. Ron Paul is the best you got for this election. The people in Iowa must be crazy to vote for this broad.

I can't believe Americans would ever place their vote because of the outcome of the Iowa straw poll, but it would explain a lot.. Anyone here of the internet, how about doing research or maybe ask some questions at Stanford or Harvard or just a community college.
Come on people, I don't want my kids to go hungry; because, you want to vote for a TV AD.....

This is absolute garbage!!! Anyone with a brain who actually watched the debate knows Ron Paul is the clear frontrunner is this election.  All of the online voting had Ron Paul winning by a landslide.  He has the balls to get rid of the parasites called the Federal Reserve which charges us interest just to print our own money.  The mainstream media is trying to hide him from us.  If you look all over the internet you see Ron Paul's name everywhere.  He is our last hope!  RON PAUL 2012

Ron Paul is your last hope America, blow this and it can have disastrous consequences, please, he has a real plan that requires sacrifice no one wants to hear that, but if we don't do the hard time now we will keep heading into deeper and deeper debt, there is no way out, no easy fix, we must face facts and smell the ink on the paper money made out of thin air, and get real, instead of these unrealistic approaches to the problem. Paul is honest he tells you straight with no philandering have you noticed... He doesn't fit in, he is his own man. Which to me makes him more trustworthy than 5o politicians, he is the only one who has got the constitution correct, I hate most of or not all politicians but this one got my attention find out why, READ about Ron Paul stupid lazy sheep people and maybe you will get a clue. Don't make the biggest mistake of your life time is against all of us and it is running out.

Ron Paul is the last person that may be able to save this country.  This great country cannot stand another mouthpiece that does not get anything of substance done.  Ron Paul is the only person wanting to shut down the Fed!  HE is the only one that understands a strong dollar policy and has requested and gotten an audit of the fed.  These media shrills just want to shut him down.  My Vote is for Paul.

What's frustrating is that on most mainstream news, Ron Paul isn't even mentioned.  Just Michelle and Pawlenty.  Not bad for a guy who people once thought of as a nut job!  America is waking up.  If Ron debates Obama, Obama's going to lose!  Ron's just too intelligent.

These straw polls have nothing but symbolic meaning. The candidates with some good ideas get the votes then the primaries start and the corrupt candidates that have the backing money of the corporations, but no good ideas, win the nomination. So basically a waste of time.

All these candidates are trash..... especially Ron Paul.... Libertarian? Means he serves big business..... the Koch Brothers are libertarians and they own the 2nd largest privately owned company in America. Koch Industries. Backers of the Tea Party. I would be very cautious about this Paul character......

"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government.  It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policies, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world’s greatest civilizations has been 200 years." -- historian Alexander Frazier Tyler, referring to ancient Athens, among other democracies.  He died in 1813.

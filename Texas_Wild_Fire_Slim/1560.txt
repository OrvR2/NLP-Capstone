NYT’s Friedman: ‘Way too soon to tell’ if media blew it vetting Obama the candidateBy Jeff Poor - The Daily Caller | The Daily Caller – Sun, Aug 21, 2011







Back during the 2008 presidential election cycle, many Americans were captivated by the promises of hope and change that emanated from then-candidate Barack Obama. And some would argue that much of the media were taking in by the promises too. Nearly three years in to the Obama presidency, is it fair to say the media were duped?
On Sunday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” host Howard Kurtz asked New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman just that question. According to Friedman, the jury is still out.
“Way too soon to tell that kind of thing, I think,” Friedman said. “I think if — look, what have I been calling for, you know the president to have — I think there is, we just so desperately needed a grand bargain that involves restructuring of debt, raising of taxes, cutting of spending and investing in the sources of our strengths as a country from everything from infrastructure to government-funded research to education. It’s so clear that’s what we need. My personal frustration with Obama has been that while he certainly tried that grand bargain for a little bit, it just kind of went away. Well, it didn’t on the work. He said [House Speaker John] Boehner backed out. I don’t know who backed out.” (RELATED: Levin calls for integration of Obama vacation spot Martha’s Vineyard)
Kurtz pointed out that Friedman had an unusual closeness with Obama as one of his golfing partners. Friedman said his closeness to the president was a benefit.
“Yeah, anytime you spend four hours with the president, either with a spoon in your hand or a golf club in your hand or nothing in your hand or nothing in your hand — you learn something,” Friedman said. “If he invites you to lunch — anytime you get a chance to talk to the president in any context I find incredibly beneficial.”

Well this journalist is stupid. You are duped. You got duped when you were told that you got an education. Go back and get one. The president has NOTHING to do with law. He can suggest, but he cannot make the rules. He cannot by himself rule on or handle the economy balance in any fashion. He can scream in their faces, but the Toy party has already decided that they are sabotaging the office of the POTUS, because that tribe thinks they are living in reality tv. In the real world, there is nothing the president can do, because that is not his job. His job is merely to say he would like to do this and do that, and let the congress debate decide, to talk to world leaders, and to kiss babies. That is his job. People like that journalist, really need to look at a civics book.  All of you posers really need to study what the COC's job is.

"Blew it?" Shoot, they were ringleading that nonsense.

How long does Friedman think it will take before we can establish Obama's level of credibility? At least another term, I bet. It sure sounds like he would hate to have to give up golfing with the president.

Obama was and is clearly unqualified. this was obvious to anyone not blinded by the desire to 'be part of an historical event'

If President Obama & the Democratic controlled congress had performed well together, we would not now be stuck w/ the Congress that we have. Get over it; Obama was a one term Junior Senator from Illinois & a community organizer before he was elected President. Hardly qualified for the job; and it shows. the media new this all along; they also had access to all of the information concerning Obamas misdeeds w/ Tony Rezco, etc., yet they chose to ignore it...Why? Because Obama is black; and they knew he would pull the RACE CARD on them if they brought any of it up.

Some of his history was known, about as much as today. We still don't know what his college grades were, but we knew where he grew up and went to school (Indonesia, Muslim), went to church and who was the pastor (Wright), and who he associated with in Chicago (Bill Ayers/Bernadine Dohrn, Tony Rezko), and who he worked for (Acorn).  I still can't believe this guy got elected President of the United States with those qualifications.

Too early to tell?  Heck, if it was obvious enough at the time that Saturday Night Live was poking fun at it then I'd say it is way *past* time to be able to tell.  He got a free ride because he was a good story.  People tend to forget that the modern news media isn't about promoting the common good, it's about making a profit, and so naturally they'll go for the good story every time.

A president can only do so much. Bills, laws,  budget,  everything is controled by congress. If they are unwilling to help ( as in the case of Jimmy Carter) nothing can or will be done. At this point the whole country can collapse into a depression to make the 1930's look good and congress on both sides will just set there and blame each other. We need people who have the intrests of the country FIRST. Not simply defeating a sitting president.

Simple question answers that issue:  Was Obama given the same "vetting" treatment as Sarah Palin?  The answer is an obvious, and resounding, no.  Obama was treated with kid gloves, up to and including the LA Times burying a politically compromising video of him toasting Islamic terrorists, while Palin was given the bare knuckles treatment.

Hahaha!  The main stream media didn't vet him at all.  He got the ultimate free pass and the entire world knows it.  But, NYT, you spend time kicking it around.  The time spent pondering the issue is time otherwise spent writing your crap articles anyway.

The media (independent) lost it's credibility starting in the 60's when they went from reporting the facts to shaping the facts. It's funny how they are now trying to ease away from the anointed one. The 24/7 news that pick sides is the main cause of the polarization of politics today.

As the junior senator from Illinois, Barack would have been better off as the Vice-President. He had no executive experience whatsoever and hadn't even finished his first term. He was clearly unqualified. The news media intentionally ignored those facts, they weren't duped.

Thomas Friedman is an insightful commentator on most things, but he blew it on this one. The tragic truth is that Obama is a failure as president. So far, he's not as bad as Bush and Clinton were, but he is a failure none the less.

Sure he was vetted, He had the right accent, He wore the right clothes, He was half black and most important had a D after his name.

Oh thats rich, asking the left wing New York Times if Obama was properly vetted?  This NYTimes writer has the gall to say we don't know yet?  Either he was or he wasn't and the fact he has been an epic failure does not matter.  The left wing media latched onto this inexperienced and yes incompetent guy and promoted him endlessly.  The left wing media intentionally passed on researching his past because they did not care to confirm his past associates and dealings with socialist hero's and even American hating terrorist like Bill Ayers.NYTimes your glory days have passed and educated Americans no longer trust your biased #$%$

Why would ANYONE rely on, or trust, the media to have vetted Obama?  I would not consider the MSM worthy of vetting my dog, let alone a potential POTUS.  So many people were swayed by the charismatic efforts of the powers that be to install this current president.  Did any of you do any reading or investigating on your own before you voted for this absolutely inexperienced, inept, and radical president?  The more I read, the scarier he became with his affiliations/ties to certain people, his racist views against whites, his totally obvious dislike for this country, and his pitifully appalling "resume."  I guess a lot of you did not care or did not take the time to do your homework.  Now, we are ALL paying for that mistake.  Just led like blind sheep to slaughter.  Do you continue to be enthralled with Obama's lies and lack of leadership?  I am quite positive some will again vote for him ... maybe just because he is black ... or quite possibly because you think he is doing an excellent job, etc.  That is a travesty, but then again one need not possess an IQ above 50 to be eligible to vote.  Do not listen to the twisted and biased media to obtain your information.  Use your brain and spend some time researching candidates.  Do not continue to think or believe that you are too ignorant or lazy to succeed in doing so.  YOU CAN DO IT ...!!!  YES, YOU CAN ...!!!

Texas Gov. Rick Perry will have a $1,000-a-person fundraiser in Washington, D.C., toward the end of the month, the Daily Caller reports.
The Daily Caller snagged a copy of the invitation to the Sept. 27 event, which Perry’s presidential campaign is billing as a “Washington Kickoff.” It’s taking place at a hotel near the White House.
If you want a photo op with the presidential hopeful, there’s a premium: “Raise $10,000,” the invitation says.
Perry, of course, has surged in polls over the past few weeks and received widespread attention for his statements on Social Security.

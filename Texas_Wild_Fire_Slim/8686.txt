Europe debt crisis, US woes weigh on Wall StreetAFP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011

US stock markets slumped Tuesday amid fears that Europe's sovereign debt crisis was spinning out of control and concerns about the United States's own shaky economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 100.96 points (0.90 percent) to close at 11,139.30, its third straight trading day with triple-digit losses.
The broader S&P 500 fell 8.73 points (0.74 percent) to 1,165.24, while the Nasdaq Composite, buoyed by surprising strength in the tech sector, slipped only 6.50 points (0.26 percent) to 2,473.83.
US stocks plunged more than two percent after markets reopened from a long holiday weekend with investors concerned that Greece would fail to meet debt-cutting goals and that Germany would drop support to the latest Greece bailout plan.
The global jitters sent US government debt, a traditional safe-haven asset, briefly surging to new record highs.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to a historic low of 1.929 percent before bouncing back. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.
The turnaround was boosted by positive data on the US service sector, which grew more than expected in August, according to a monthly survey by the Institute for Supply Management.
The ISM index of non-manufacturing activity rose to 53.3 percent last month, up from 52.7 percent in July. Any level above 50 indicates growth.
Investors hunting for bargains also helped the stock market pare its early losses, with gains by technology companies like Apple and Netflix, both up 1.5 percent.
"The tech sector has been leading the market on its rally from the morning?s lows. It lent a bottom-fishing mentality," said Michael James, managing director at Wedbush Morgan Securities.
Investors were "looking to scoop some of the names that have had big moves down in the last three days," James said.
International Paper surged 8.9 percent after the paper and packaging company said it had reached a $4.3 billion takeover deal with its rival Temple-Inland, whose own shares skyrocketed 25.3 percent.
Sunoco jumped 5.3 percent after the fuel vendor announced it was exiting the low-margin refining business.
Bank stocks ended the day with sharp losses, with Bank of America down 3.6 percent, Citigroup off 2.5 percent and JPMorgan Chase down 3.4 percent.
Financial stocks have been pummeled by fears of contagion from Europe's sovereign debt crisis as well as concerns about the mounting cost of litigation stemming from the subprime-mortgage debacle.
US authorities unveiled lawsuits against more than a dozen US and foreign banks late on Friday, alleging that the banks' faulty mortgage-backed securities ended up costing US taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.
Bond prices, after flirting with record territory, pared their gains but still ended up higher than last week's levels.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 1.98 percent from 2.00 percent late Friday, while that on the 30-year bond dropped to 3.24 percent from 3.31 percent.

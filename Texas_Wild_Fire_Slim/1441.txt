The Identity Festival touched down in Hollywood on Sunday, and damn if it wasn’t a hip-shaking sub-bass sonic frenzy of a good time. This touring electronic music festival, the first of its kind in the United States, has been roving the country since August, sending intergenerational audiences wild with a revolving lineup of some of the genre’s best known legends and hottest newcomers.
The scene was no different yesterday at the Hollywood Palladium. 
The scene: A crowd of 3,700 girls in tutus, boys in neon t-shirts and a whole lot of people who never once took their sunglasses off. 
The sounds: A crew of DJs and producers that included Hercules and Love Affair, Booka Shade, KCRW’s Jason Bentley, Pete Tong, The Crystal Method, Steve Aoki, The Disco Biscuits and Pretty Lights.
An eleventh hour venue change moved Identity from San Bernardino to the Palladium, which proved to be an apt location for everyone who couldn’t make Burning Man to bask in the twelve hour festival's vibe of whimsical self expression and communal affection. By all accounts, Identity ran smoothly, with no lines for the bathrooms, an efficient flow between the two stages and a crowd that maintained its coherence, even while traveling to various realms of cosmic awareness on the power of all those well-layed beats.

				a cool concept to have an electro festival in the US, hopefully the lineup will improve going forward and it will actually be worth going as this year had mostly crappy, electro-fo­r-noob acts. Until that time comes I'll continue to make the trip across the pond to east London for the real deal at Lovebox festival.

				It wasn't really compared to Burning Man, just mentioned as something to do for people in LA who couldn't make it to the desert festival. The connection seems to be that both scenes dig electronic music. And don't suburban kids deserve a place to express themselves too?

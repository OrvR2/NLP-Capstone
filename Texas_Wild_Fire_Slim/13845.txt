Getting rain won't do a whole bunch at this point. It would have to rain about ten to twelve inches for us to be safe from another fire. But thanks for your though and prayers. And by the way, firemen do NOT get enough.respect. you realize﻿ that when you can see nothing but there shadows from inside a fire. The fire department is 100 percent responsible for my town still standing.

@rayglass48﻿ So far, it seems like the camp is ok. But you never know with wildfires.

Frost bombs or Ice bombs are pressurized bio-degrable n2pkp﻿ containers dropped from aircraft, as I've suggested in OPERATION FROST on youtube. It could make a difference right now. Just give it some thought.

The drought has turned the Lost﻿ Pines into a tinderbox, unfortunately. I'm glad they saved the CCC structures.

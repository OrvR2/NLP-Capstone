Kate Moss has been shilling for Rimmel London since 2005, when she threw on a leather jacket and jumped on a motorcycle to promote the brand's mascara.
But this new ad, in which the newlywed model strips down to her skivvies and rocks out with The Vaccines, just may be our favorite. 
Promoting Rimmel's new lipstick (although you can't really tell until the end, as Kate looks fresh and bare-faced as usual), the video shows Kate crashing a photo shoot of sleepy models, crashing a band's recording session and running away from the things she is actually supposed to do, i.e. posing for photo shoots.
Sounds like classic Kate to us.
Of course, she is now calling the shots: the new line of lipsticks is Kate's own collection that she created for Rimmel, not unlike the line she worked on for Topshop for several years. The Independent reports that the lipstick collection, which includes seven different shades, launches at Boots in the UK today. 
Below, check out Kate sporting bright red lips and little else.

				Sorry, don't get the attraction of Kate Moss - never have.  To me she looks cheap but perhaps embodies the look that Rimmel want ... after all it is a cheap cosmetic brand.  Charlize Theron's new ad for Dior is SO much better than this.

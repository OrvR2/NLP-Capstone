Works as expected. I use a hit of powder salt to increase the evaporation. Very soothing the entire family during winter and prevents cough/congestion. I recommend this to everyone and I've been using this product for about 3 years. A+

The product is fine and the seller was very kind to send a replacement bottle when one was damaged in the mail.  However the problem I have is with the vaporizer because when I use the inhalant, you don't smell the product and the amount put in the vaporizer is still there.  Not the products fault.

Marana Says “Heck NO” To Pima County Again!



								11th September							

								2011							


							written by Arizona Kid						

TUCSON, AZ (KOLD) - The Pima County-wide first responder communication system will be going online in late 2013, but without one of the larger towns in the area.
The Pima County Wireless Integrated Network, or PCWIN, will allow firefighters, police, deputies and other emergency services to easily communicate on the same radio system.
The town of Marana isn’t a part of this effort, even though Marana residents are paying Read More

As Tucson’s Nov. 8 General Election nears, it’s becoming more obvious that Pima County Democratic Party chairman Jeff Rogers is stepping up his behind-the-scenes efforts to manipulate and control Tucson city government. Specifically, he’s told Councilman Paul Cunningham, a Democrat, to toe the party line.
To that end, Rogers told Cunningham he is not to second motions made Read More

Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan, Pima County’s ambitious but flawed scheme
by Jonathan DuHamel on Sep. 06, 2011
Pima County’s Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan (SDCP) has been touted as one of the best and most comprehensive habitat conservation plans in the country. Planning began in 1998 in response to the 1997 listing of the Cactus Ferruginous pygmy owl as an endangered species. The owl was Read More

Tucson City Manager Is Gone – Is It Tonight Or In A Year? Uhlich/Romero/Fimbres v. Kozachik/Cunningham – Where’s Scott Going To Land?



								7th September							

								2011							


							written by Arizona Kid						

Arizona Daily Star – Rob O’Dell – Tucson City Manager Mike Letcher resigned Tuesday, effective in August 2012, in the face of rising criticism over a series of management scandals at City Hall.
Although Letcher said he would step down in 11 months, it’s unclear if the City Council will allow him to stay in the job for that long. Only Councilwoman Karin Uhlich, his strongest supporter, fully endorsed the 11-month timeline Tuesday.
Others, such as Paul Cunningham and Steve Kozachik, said they would never agree to the 11-month timetable. Kozachik called for Letcher to be fired Read More

Help Wanted – Tucson City Manager….AGAIN – KOLD/Bud Foster



								6th September							

								2011							


							written by Downtown Dudette						

Wednesday’s Tucson city council’s study session agenda includes an executive session which says in part, time has been set aside for discussion of dismissal or resignation  of a public officer or appointee.
News 13 managed to catch up with five of the six council members at the annual Labor Day picnic and while they were not talking publicly, on the record or on camera they left little doubt they will be debating the future of Mike Letcher, who has been Tucson’s city manager since 2009.
Letcher was given the job amid much fanfare following the firing of his boss at the time, Mike Hein.
Letcher was approved by a 6 to 1 vote in part because of his 30 years experience in city government.
One council member said Letcher was appointed to bring transparency to the office and to find and fix problems.
He found some of Read More

Tucson Worst Housing Market In US. Az Republic



								1st September							

								2011							


							written by Arizona Kid						

TUCSON – With his company’s business up and inventory at a five-year low, real-estate agent Greg Hollman said the housing market in Arizona’s second-largest metropolitan area is thriving.
“The Tucson housing market is doing well in many areas, especially properties in the lower-priced end,” he said.
But that assessment runs counter to a recent national report that branded Tucson the nation’s sickest Read More

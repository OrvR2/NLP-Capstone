       England had to sweat hard before they came from behind to score a 13-9 victory over England in the Rugby World Cup. Argentina led 6-3 at half time. With only 13 minutes to go Argentina were leading 9-3. Argentina had to blame only themselves as Felipe Contepomi, who landed an early penalty but then missed his second, and then Martin Rodriguez also missed one. Had these penalties been taken it would have been a different story altogather. England punished Argentina during the last ten minutes for their sloppy work as first Jhonny Wilkinson scored and added a penalty with six minutes to go to give England the lead. The match was keenly watched by both the English and Argentinian fans and a tremendous atmosphere was created. This was the first ever Rugby match on a fully endorsed grass. It was played in the New Otago's stadium. The results of the other matches so far has been: Scotland 34-24 Romania Fiji 49 - 25 Namibia France 47 - 21 Japan        1 of 84        
Youngs spared England's blushes with his late try

        Welsh-born actor Andy Whitfield has died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on Sunday September 11, 2011 in Australia at the age of 39! Whitfield had been diagnosed with the disease back in March of 2010 and had an 18-month battle with the disease, though he had been declared cancer-free only two months following his diagnosis, only to have it recur by the end of 2010. Whitfield was an engineer by trade prior to becoming an actor and had moved to Sydney, Australia in 1999, where he attended the Screenwise Film & TV School for Actors, which led to a successful acting career in various Australian television series. The handsome young actor, who starred in the Starz television series Spartacus: Blood and Sand, as Spartacus in the series since 2010, has eight acting titles to his credit, including The Clinic, McLeod’s Daughters, All Saints and The Strip.  Andy Whitfield is survived by his wife Vashti Whitfield and his two children.        1 of 3

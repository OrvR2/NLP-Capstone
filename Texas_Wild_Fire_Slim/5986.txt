By LYNN BERRY, Associated Press
TUNOSHNA, Russia -- A Russian jet carrying a top ice hockey team crashed just after takeoff Wednesday, killing at least 43 people and leaving two others critically injured, officials said. It was one of the worst plane crashes ever involving a sports team.
The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said the Yak-42 plane crashed into a riverbank on the Volga River immediately after leaving an airport near the western city of Yaroslavl, 150 miles (240 kilometers) northeast of Moscow. It was sunny at the time.

(See photos of the crash below.)
The plane was carrying the Lokomotiv ice hockey team from Yaroslavl to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, where the team was to play Thursday against Dinamo Minsk in the opening game of the season for the Kontinental Hockey League. The ministry said the plane had 45 people on board, including 37 passengers and eight crew.
Officials said Russian player Alexander Galimov survived the crash along with a crewmember.
A Czech embassy official said Czech players Josef Vasicek, Karel Rachunek and Jan Marek were among those killed, and Latvian officials confirmed the death of Latvian defenseman Karlis Skrastins.
"This is the darkest day in the history of our sport. This is not only a Russian tragedy, the Lokomotiv roster included players and coaches from 10 nations," said Rene Fasel, president of the international Ice Hockey Federation. "This is a terrible tragedy for the global ice hockey community."
In recent years, Russia and the other former Soviet republics have had some of the world's worst air traffic safety records. Experts blame the poor safety record on the age of the aircraft, weak government controls, poor pilot training and a cost-cutting mentality.
The plane that crashed was built in 1993 and belonged to a small Moscow-based Yak Service company.
Swarms of police and rescue crews rushed to Tunoshna, a picturesque village with a blue-domed church on the banks of the Volga River. One of the plane's engines could be seen poking out of the river and a flotilla of boats combed the water for bodies. Russian rescue workers struggled to heft the bodies of large, strong athletes in stretchers up the muddy, steep riverbank.
One resident, Irina Pryakhova, saw the plane going down, then heard a loud bang and saw a plume of smoke.
"It was wobbling in flight, it was clear that something was wrong," she said. "I saw them pulling bodies to the shore, some still in their seats with seatbelts on."
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin immediately sent the nation's transport minister to the site, 10 miles (15 kilometers) east of Yaroslavl. President Dmitry Medvedev also planned to tour the crash site.
Lokomotiv Yaroslavl is a leading force in Russian hockey and came third in the KHL last year. The team's coach is Canadian Brad McCrimmon, who took over in May. He was most recently an assistant coach with the Detroit Red Wings, and played for years in the NHL for Boston, Philadelphia, Detroit, Hartford and Phoenix.
The Russian team also featured several top European players and former NHL stars, including Slovakian forward and national team captain Pavol Demitra, who played in the NHL for the St. Louis Blues and Vancouver Canucks.
Other top names on the team include Russian defenseman Ruslan Salei and Swedish goalie Stefan Liv.
The KHL is an international club league that pits together teams from Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia and Slovakia. Lokomotiv was a three-time Russian League champion in 1997, 2002-2003. It took bronze last season.
A cup match between hockey teams Salavat Yulaev and Atlant in the central Russian city of Ufa was called off midway after news of the crash was announced by Kontinental Hockey League head Alexander Medvedev. Russian television broadcast images of an empty arena in Ufa as grief-stricken fans abandoned the stadium.
"We will do our best to ensure that hockey in Yaroslavl does not die, and that it continues to live for the people that were on that plane," said Russian Ice Hockey Federation President Vladislav Tretyak.
Medvedev has announced plans to take aging Soviet-built planes out of service starting next year. The short- and medium-range Yak-42 has been in service since 1980 and about 100 are still being used by Russian carriers.
In June, another Russian passenger jet crashed in the northwestern city of Petrozavodsk, killing 47 people. The crash of that Tu-134 plane has been blamed on pilot error.
In other plane crashes involving sports teams, 75 Marshall University football players, coaches, fans and airplane crew died in a plane crash in Kentucky on Nov. 17, 1970, on the way home from a game. Twenty-six of the dead were players
Thirty members of the Uruguayan rugby club Old Christians were killed in a crash in the Andes in 1972.
The entire 18-member U.S. figure skating team died in a crash on their way to the 1961 world championships in Brussels.
In 1949, the Torino soccer team lost 18 players near Turin, Italy, while the Munich air crash of 1958 cost eight Manchester United players their lives.

Pavol Demitra, Ruslan Salei, Igor Korolev  Aleksandr Karpovtsev Stefan Liv, Jan Marek, Karel Rachunek and Josef Vasicek etc.

				Yes,this is a tragic event.But is there a clandestin­e reason behind all of this? Like the possibilit­y of the plane carrying journalist that wanted to cover more that just a mere hockey game ?
The Russians have a kind of "Hall of Fame" filled with the names of journalist who met with an 
"accidenta­l death." Their demise was as serious as being just plain shot to death,to falling out of a two story window. 
It's disgusting how the Russians like to commit the most atricious of crimes,and yet (Their) news agencies  viewed as national threats.
LOL,,,,,ha­s Communism really left Russia ? Not hardly. The "former" KGB operative,­Valdamir Putin is a devout Communist ready to die for his country. The "president­" is nothing more thatn a puppet in Putin's hand. Sickning !

				It was just a matter of time for some idiot to blame Obama for this tragedy. Try being a little more sensitive to the families and friends of those who lost their lives in this plane crash.

				maybe, just maybe, if they worried more about putting their money into helping their people instead of having enough bombs to blow everybody into oblivion this would not have happened.
the same for us here in the united states, if our government was concerned with the welfare of our people instead of the russians having more weapons than us we could solve allot of problems at home.
however all the people who make the bombs wouldn't like that because they wouldn't make as much money. it really is that simple

				I am beginning to think that teams or groups of any kind, be it military or otherwise-­---not travel as a group.  In Viet Nam we called this a "Cluster F%^$"  because if everyone is standing around in a group, when something happens  it not only happens to one individual­, but the whole team or group? This may be a over simplifica­tion but we loose too many good people with one incident!  My regards to their loved ones.

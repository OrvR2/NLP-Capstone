This Is How Insanely Fast the Texas Wildfires Are Spreading

 The place: North of Bastrop State Park, Texas. The time: September 5, 2011. The bottom line: wildfires spread so insanely fast that it's terrifying. This has not been altered in any way. It's real time. Wildfires have been roaring for the past eight days, powered by winds reaching up to 60 miles per hour. As of September 6, the Bastrop fire has destroyed an estimated 600 homes already, advancing through a 16-mile front. More than 1,000 homes and 115,000 acres have been destroyed so far.

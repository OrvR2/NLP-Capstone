AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — First the Tri-Nations title, now Richie McCaw's mantle as the pre-eminent openside flanker in the world. David Pocock is starting to make a habit of pilfering New Zealand's more treasured rugby jewels.Less than two weeks after helping Australia win its first Tri-Nations since 2001, Pocock was rated by All Blacks great Josh Kronfeld as a currently superior breakaway than McCaw in what is an almost sacrilegious statement as New Zealand prepares to host the Rugby World Cup.Kronfeld told The Times of London that Pocock "is the form No.7 of the world at the moment, a master."Pocock was taken aback by the praise from "a legend of the game." He says "that is something come from him" but "even Richie not as his best is pretty good."

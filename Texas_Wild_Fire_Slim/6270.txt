Now that Eddie Murphy has secured his next role as Oscar host--we can't forget about the other Murphy-Brett Ratner collaboration: "Tower Heist."
The movie playfully imagines a scenario where hotel workers fall into a ponzi scheme and try to get revenge. Ratner's film is a kind of kids movie with grown up motifs.
Beyond Murphy, the movie boasts a kind of shockingly impressive cast: Ben Stiller, Casey Affleck, Alan Alda, Matthew Broderick, Téa Leoni and Gabourey Sidibe. 
Judging by the new poster, the film should be--at the very least--amusing. 
"Tower Heist" hits theaters November 4.

				Murphy is of the age where other comic actors usually segue into dramatic character roles. Robin Williams, Steve Martin, Bill Murray, even ben Stiller. It usually happens at about the time where their humor starts to show a faint tinge of desperatio­n. I think its time for Murphy to get some small dramatic character parts on his resume.

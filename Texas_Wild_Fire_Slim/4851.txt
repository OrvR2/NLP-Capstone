Passport Canada says it's on track to issue more secure passport next yearBy Jonathan Montpetit, The Canadian Press | The Canadian Press – Tue, 13 Sep, 2011

MONTREAL - Canada is finally set to join the rest of the G8 in issuing electronically secure passports but security experts warn the new documents are not a panacea for evolving threats.Passport Canada CEO Christine Desloges promised on Tuesday that her agency will start issuing ePassports by the end of next year."Canada is on track for the full-scale delivery of its ePassport," Desloges told a conference at the Montreal headquarters of the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization."Next year we will roll out the full issuance of the ePassports to our citizens."An electronic passport has been in the works since 2004 as part of Ottawa's national security policy.The 2008 federal budget renewed the government's commitment to the project, initially setting the launch date for 2011.A spokesperson for Passport Canada attributed the delays to an overhaul of the passport application process, adding that the government was eager to make the switch."Our current passport is very safe," Monique Boivin said. "But with the new one it will be even more so."In the meantime, Canada has fallen behind much of the rest of the world, where electronic passports have become the norm.Every other G8 member has the new passports in place and roughly 100 countries in all are using the document.Canada's electronic passport will resemble the current paper version but include a range of machine-readable security features.Chief among these is a chip that will contain face-recognition data. Passport applicants will have their face cross-checked against Passport Canada's own database as well as various security watchlists.Boivin said these high-tech features will make it easier for border guards to screen potential threats trying to enter the country."If someone comes to a border with a fraudulent passport, it will be detected," she said.Impressive as the new passport may be, security experts caution against becoming overly reliant on the technology.David Clark, president of the passport consulting firm Caicos Management Associates, raised the prospect of criminals de-magnifying the original chip and placing a new one containing fraudulent data behind a visa stamp.Other possibilities include face-recognition software not registering differences between family members who have swapped passports.Technology can't replace human vigilance, Clark told the Montreal conference."EPassports are not invincible," he said. "There is a risk in creating a false sense of security."In her speech, Desloges noted that as a result of the more resistant security features on the passport itself, fraudsters are now targeting the application process."A secure issuance process is as important as a secure ePassport," she said. "Building a secure issuance process is ... a job (that) is never finished."In particular, international security officials are concerned about so-called breeder documents such as bank statements, college admission letters and phone bills which are used to apply for passports and visas."There is a continuing problem with the integrity of passports and other identity documents due to haphazard issuing processes in some countries and the uncertainty of the breeder documents which form the basis of the passport issued," the head of the UN's Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate, Mike Smith, said in a speech."Border control is probably the field that needs the most work in terms of national action."But efforts to improve the security of travel documents come with added costs, and those are likely to get passed on to travellers.Passport Canada, after all, is a self-financed branch of the Canadian government; its operating budget comes from passport fees.Boivin acknowledged the ePassport is more expensive to produce, but said Passport Canada would consult the public before seeking Ottawa's approval to raise its fees."We will publish the new fee schedule this fall and Canadians will have the chance to comment, or complain," she said.

so will we join the rest of the world and have 10 year passports as well? Or will we continue the cash grab every 5 years?

Our money is set to be made into plastic cards with chips as well, meaning no more anonymous cash transactions. No more freedom at all. God I hate these people.

I don't understand why the passport page(the young lady) shows a Romanian passport ant not a Canadian one.... I'm confused.

If Canada and 100 other countries all utilize this new chip/facial recognition Passport technology then I guess that means illegals crossing borders will be a thing of the past and what we'll save on Homeland Security should pay the added cost to cover what we know will be a big new cash grab for the Feds,or not!

They say that these are expensive features, but that is nonsense. RFID chips cost a few cents to manufacture, the problem is how invasive these technologies are. You can keep them in an aluminized sleeve, like computer chips are stored in, to block out much of the transmission range.

Oh, God forbid Canada "fall behind the other nations". Think about it, they are implying that not doing exactly what other countries are doing means falling behind, and these same jerks will simultaneously deny that there is a path towards world government and call you crazy for suggesting it is happening. There is zero national sovereignty left and it makes me wish I had another planet to go to and leave these miserable psychopathic control freaks to rot in hell.

Boivin says "Canadians will have the chance to comment, or complain". This is double speak for we don't really care what you say we will do whatever we want.

I feel that the Government is using this new passport so they can play GOD with us.  They are saying that it is for our best interest and safety, but what they are doing is taking away our freedom.  Their is nothing wrong with our old passports and we don't need a chip so they can track us every where we go. PEOPLE OPEN YOUR EYES and look what is happening to your freedom. The Government is slowly taking it away and you don't even realize it THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING

Don't you know the new e-passport has 10 years validity?  I just don't understand why people complain before they do their research (like reading more news articles).

Mine is due for renewal. Does that mean that I have to pay to renew it and then pay all over AGAIN when the new type comes out?

I would think it more important to get rid of double dipping dual-citizenship/ dual passport  holders. A much more efficient safety measure. 
Guess how many middle-eastern immigrants still have their own passports as well as qualifying for ours after 3  YEARS already.!!

We are creatures of this world and don't have the right to create borders. We as humans should be free to travel anywhere we choose without any passport or so called offical documentation. Just another step for the "alluminati" and the so called G8(puppets) follow along

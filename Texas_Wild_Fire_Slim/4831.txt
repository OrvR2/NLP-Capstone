@jmjfanss Look up "Political Ponerology" by Andrew Lobaczewski w interview with﻿ editor Jada Knight.
BTW, Rockefeller is a Zionist Baptist.
See "the NWO , Secret Societies and Biblical Prophesy". It says these things more eloquently than I ever could!

@1tonykirk
The Rockerfellers and the rothchilds are not true jewish people, they are zionist psychopaths
they will never be in the tradition of real jews.
even the schiff family is the lesser of the evils, especially peter schiff.

@jmjfanss I'm in full support of Ron Paul since 2007. I'm trying to﻿ say that it is our responsibility as Americans in support of Dr Ron Paul to do your own research. There are issues he cannot discuss until we all know the whole picture.
This is what being an American is all about. Action!

@jmjfanss Yes, this is true. But he needs you,... every other American needs you to see and know more than what Dr Paul can say without endangering his life.
See on YT: "Republic of Missouri, the change our founders believed in", "Ken Cousins on the Land"; on Google: "The Act﻿ of 1871", "USA vs US".

@1tonykirk
But out of all of them, I Think ron paul is the only one that really and truly defends﻿ the U.S. Constitution.

Volatility Is Your FriendBy Daniel Fisher William P. Barrett | Forbes – Wed, Aug 24, 2011

"Volatile Market Dashes Investors," screamed a USA Today headline during the recent market convulsions. Sure, volatility can dash your plans if you were about to sell stocks to make a down payment on a house or pay your kid's college tuition or were using your margin account to pay your living expenses. Volatility is also a wealth killer if it makes you panic and dump all your equity holdings at the bottom. But if you're a long-term investor, volatility can work to your advantage. That's because, historically, sharp swings have canceled each other out to produce, over time, a gentle upward trend for stocks. If this pattern continues, volatility should make you richer, since you can periodically buy stocks at a discount.
 Before worrying about profiting from volatility, however, you need to make sure you've protected yourself from it. William T. Baldwin of Pillar Financial Advisors in Waltham, Mass. recommends keeping enough cash to cover 24 months of living expenses so you aren't forced to sell at the bottom. "You want to be in control of the situation, instead of having the situation in control of you," he says.
 If panic, not cash needs, might force you to sell, fortify yourself by settling on, and sticking to, a smart asset allocation. What's that? A mix of stocks, bonds and other asset classes that makes sense given your age, wealth and income needs. For someone in her early 40s a proper mix might be 70% global equities and 30% fixed income. "If your strategy didn't keep you calm during this period, maybe you should revisit it," says Gregory Peterson, research director of Massachusetts-based Ballentine Partners.
 Investors must remember stocks play a specific role in their portfolio, and it's not to provide solace every night or even comfort over the next year or two, says John Sweeney, executive vice president in charge of planning advisory services at Fidelity Investments. Nope, what stocks do is provide crucial protection over time from inflation, which is a bigger threat to your long-term financial well-being than any one-day swing.
 Reviewing and changing your asset allocation because of changes in your age and life--say, retirement--is a good thing. Doing it as a panicky response to temporary market conditions is not.
 For proof look no further than the 2008 crash. Fidelity says those 401(k) investors who dumped all their stocks between October 2008 and March 2009 and then stayed out of stocks had a mere 2% increase in account balances through June 30, 2011, including new contributions. By contrast, those who held on through those dark days saw a much larger average increase of 50%.
 What about buying protection against market swoons? Your broker may try to sell you options, futures or hedge funds. And there are a host of inverse exchange-traded funds that are designed to rise in value if a specific sector or index declines. Be skeptical.
 Many of the inverse and leveraged ETFs are designed for traders and priced daily. So long-term holders often don't earn the returns they think they should. For example, through mid-August the Russell 2000 was down 16%. However, if you had owned the ProShares UltraShort Russell 2000, which purports to provide a negative 200% of the underlying index, your gain would have been not 32% but 21%.
 One of the simplest hedges is to buy a put--an option that gives you the right, but not the obligation, to sell a security at a specified price, for a certain period of time. Problem is, the price of a put is largely based on a stock's volatility and skyrockets just when you need it, and puts don't last all that long.


 Ballentine Partners' Peterson says he researched hedges early this year and found that protecting against a greater than 30% decline in the market cost 4% of holdings, or $400,000 for a $10 million portfolio. Worse, that was for options that expired worthless after just four months--and the price is double or triple that now. Says he, "You have to have it in place before you need it, because by the time you need it, it's too expensive."
 Some brokers also peddle option strategies that purport to be costless but that are part of an expensive, fee-laden package. Then there are hedge funds, which for fees of 2% per year plus 20% of profits promise to produce returns independent of stock market trends; if you're tempted, read about a cheaper ETF alternative in "Hedging for Cheapskates".
 Okay, so how can you benefit from volatility? One way is to do nothing. When volatility gets crazy and markets get panicky, the feds can be counted on to goose stocks with lower interest rates, economic stimulus and other tools. "Typically, there is a policy response" by government after severe fluctuations in the market, says Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. If the response is "appropriate, fast enough and big enough," he adds, "then the market will recover."
 Over the past 21 years stocks have shown an average 13.2% return in the 12 months after bouts of severe volatility. In the year after the volatility peak just before the November 2008 election the market return was 12.4%. Nor do you have to be a genius at market timing to benefit from these swings. For example, assuming you're contributing regularly to a 401(k), you'll buy some stocks at the low prices.
 You can squeeze even more advantage out of volatility by rebalancing, which means buying or selling stocks to stick to a predetermined asset allocation. Say you want your money to be 65% in stocks and 35% in bonds. If the market value of your stocks drops 15% and your bonds rise 15%, you'll have to buy some stocks and sell some bonds to maintain that 65% stock allocation. In effect, the simple discipline of rebalancing forces you to buy stocks when they are cheaper relative to bonds and sell some when they're more expensive.
 "I hedge by rebalancing," says Roanoke, Va. financial planner Andrew M. Hudick. "For me, it's 'KISS': Keep it simple, sir."
 See "Tax Loss Recipe" for another way to profit from the recent market decline: harvesting tax losses from your taxable investment accounts.
 Of course, many investors set aside a portion of their portfolio for more risky assets. If that's you, there is another way to profit directly from volatility. Numerous ETFs and exchange-traded notes track the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as the VIX. One such ETN, with huge volume, is iPath's S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. It rose from $20 to $44 during the stormy period of early July to late August. Sounds like easy money. But that's still only half its price of $93 a year ago. Buyer beware.

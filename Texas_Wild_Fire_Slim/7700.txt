Obama rallies Richmond students to tell Congress to act on jobs plan

By  David Nakamura


RICHMOND —  A day after imploring Congress to pass his jobs bill, President Obama launched a strategic campaign to win public support with an impassioned call to thousands of college students to help him convince Congress that “the time for action is now.”Obama made the first in what the White House expects to be a series of appearances across the country during which the president will explain his $447 billion jobs plan and try to gain the upper hand in his fight with Republican rivals. Speaking before an estimated crowd of about 8,000 at the University of Richmond, the president hammered away on a refrain that he used before Congress — “pass this bill now” — as he made the case that his administration is addressing the jobs crisis with urgency even as the rest of Washington dithers.“The next election is 14 months away. We cannot wait,” Obama told the audience of enthusiastic young people, who interrupted him with shouts of “we love you!”“The American people do not have the luxury of waiting the next 14 months for action,” Obama continued. “Some live paycheck-to-paycheck, week-to-week, day-to-day. Now is not the time for people in Washington to worry about their jobs; it’s time for them to worry about your jobs. It’s time to put America back to work. It’s time to act.”
Obama’s renewed urgency comes as the economy has slowed to a near halt. The Labor Department reported that no net jobs were created in August, and the unemployment rate remains high at 9.1 percent. The president scheduled Friday’s appearance in the heart of the congressional district of one of his arch-nemeses, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), who battled Obama fiercely during the protracted debt ceiling debate this summer.As Obama began speaking, Cantor wrote on his Twitter account: “I welcome the President to Richmond. I hope he hears the same message I do back home, it is time for Washington to get out of the way.”In some strategic counter-programming, Cantor is scheduled to appear at a Richmond heavy building materials company Friday afternoon to talk to workers about jobs.

Obama, the spammer-in-chief, strikes again after jobs speech

By  David Nakamura


The spammer-in-chief was back last night.President Obama, whose official campaign Twitter account blasted out 100 messages in a single afternoon in late July, did it again Thursday night. Only this time it was the official White House press office e-mail account that lit-up inboxes. After the president’s jobs speech before Congress Thursday night, his staff sent out 39 e-mails to reporters, each declaring that yet another Obama ally “backs the American Jobs Act,” as the subject lines boasted. The e-mails came within a 1-hour, 5-minute period between 8:32 p.m. and 9:37 p.m. That’s an average of one every minute and 40 seconds. In all, Obama spoke 4,132 words in his 32-minute address. The number of words spoken by the various supporters quoted in the e-mails: 7,165.The messages included supportive comments from 10 senators, four House representatives, four governors and four mayors. Chief executives of Fortune 500 companies weighed in, as did union leaders.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was apparently so enthusiastic about Obama’s jobs plan that the White House sent out her supportive comment twice — in one e-mail, she was identified as Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, though in the other she was downgraded to mere Representative Pelosi.

Obama’s strategy is to paint Republicans as doing nothing

By  David Nakamura


Your Browser DoesNot Support IFrames.President Obama’s jobs speech before Congress on Thursday evening is the first step in a fall campaign by the White House to force congressional Republicans to the bargaining table or risk being painted as a party that is doing nothing to help struggling Americans, according to Democratic sources familiar with the administration’s strategy.Parts of the speech to a joint session of Congress were released on Thursday evening, and ask whether government officials can “stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy.”“Those of us here tonight cannot solve all of our nation’s woes. Ultimately, our recovery will be driven not by Washington, but by our businesses and our workers. But we can help,” Obama plans to say. “We can make a difference. There are steps we can take right now to improve people’s lives.”Obama plans to send Congress legislation entitled the American Jobs Act, which he said “should be nothing controversial,” and completely paid for.“The purpose of the American Jobs Act is simple: to put more people back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working,” the president will say. “You should pass this jobs plan right away.” Obama will lay out his proposals for at least a $300 billion package that aims to boost the economy through a mix of tax cuts and infrastructure investments. Some pundits have called it a make-or-break speech for a president whose approval ratings have nose-dived this summer. But inside the White House, administration officials view the speech as part of a grand strategy in which Obama will follow up with a series of events over the next few months to continue to sell his vision to the public, the Democratic sources said. And he will make clear, if Republicans are unwilling to support him, that the GOP apparently believes the economic crisis is not serious enough to warrant government action to fix it, the sources said.Obama is scheduled to speak at the University of Richmond on Friday, where he will “talk about the bipartisan proposals to grow the economy and create jobs,” according to the White House.The strategy expands the message Obama has been airing over the past month. But it won’t be an easy sell. Republicans have countered by blaming Obama’s policies for the struggling economy and suggesting that a new round of government spending will not solve the unemployment crisis. The Labor Department reported Thursday that jobless claims rose by 2,000 to 414,000  for the week ending Sept. 3. The department said last week that no net jobs were created in August.Continue reading this post »

Obama invites big business leaders, small entrepreneurs to watch jobs speech

By  David Nakamura


President Obama has invited a mix of business and labor leaders, state and city politicians and small-business entrepreneurs, including several from Maryland and Virginia, to sit in first lady Michelle Obama’s box during his jobs speech to Congress on Thursday night.The guest list makes clear Obama’s intent to highlight the potential of businesses, big and small, to hire more workers if given incentives from the government. He will lay out details of new initiatives, including tax cuts and infrastructure investments, in his speech. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who has been critical of Obama’s policies on jobs and called for him to present a bold plan, is among those  who invited. See the full list after the jump.

Who’s down on President Obama? Pretty much everyone

By  David Nakamura


With the economy in the tank and his public approval ratings at an all-time low, it’s not just House Republicans who are dumping on President Obama these days. His liberal base is finally letting its frustration with the president show, and the media have pounced on that narrative with gusto. Reporters are looking for evidence that the coalition of voting blocs that carried Obama to his historic White House sweep in 2008 might be splintering. They haven’t had to look very far.The White House believes the media are overplaying the doomsday stories about Obama’s low poll numbers with 14 months to go before the election. But a review of some recent news stories shows the president appears to have a lot of work to do to restore the faith of his liberal supporters. (Click on the links to read the full stories.)• African Americans, Washington Post, Aug. 25: “...a soaring jobless rate among African Americans and a newfound comfort by black lawmakers to criticize Obama’s economic policies are prompting the White House to recalibrate — and to focus more directly on the struggles of black America.“The shift comes amid a growing concern among some Democrats that the stubborn economic conditions in minority communities might hamper efforts by Obama’s reelection campaign to generate the large black voter turnout it needs in key cities to make up for his declining support among white independents.”• Hispanics, Washington Post, Aug. 21: “The event was part of broader efforts by the White House and Obama’s reelection campaign to rekindle excitement among Hispanic voters, many of whom have turned their backs on the president amid disappointment over his immigration policies. Key to the strategy is shifting voters’ attention beyond the caustic immigration debate with data-driven appeals that show progress in other areas, while arguing that Obama is better on immigration than any of his potential Republican foes.”• Whites, women, youth, liberals, 
Associated Press, Aug 29: “Whites and women are a reelection problem for President Barack Obama. Younger voters and liberals, too, but to a lesser extent. All are important Democratic constituencies that helped him win the White House in 2008 and whose support he’ll need to keep it next year.“An analysis of Associated Press-GfK polls, including the latest survey released last week, shows that Obama has lost ground among all those groups since he took office. The review points to his vulnerabilities and probable leading targets of his campaign as he seeks to assemble a coalition diverse enough to help him win reelection in tough economic times.”• Jews, Politico, June 29:“One said he had the sense that Obama ‘took the opportunity to throw Israel under the bus.’ Another, who swore he wasn’t getting his information from the mutually despised Fox News, admitted he’d lost faith in the president.“If several dozen interviews with POLITICO are any indication, a similar conversation is taking place in Jewish communities across the country. Obama’s speech last month seems to have crystallized the doubts many pro-Israel Democrats had about Obama in 2008 in a way that could, on the margins, cost the president votes and money in 2012 and will not be easy to repair.”• Organized labor, Talking Points Memo, Aug. 25:“The most powerful union official in the country offered reporters his harshest critique of President Obama to date Thursday, questioning Obama’s policy and strategic decisions, and claiming he aligned himself with the tea party in the debt limit fight. . . . [AFL-CIO President Richard] Trumka dismissed Obama’s recent job creation proposals — an extended payroll tax cut, patent reform, free trade deals — as ‘nibbly things that aren’t going to make a difference,’ and said the AFL-CIO might sit out the Democratic convention if he and the party don’t get serious.”• Environmentalists, 
New York Times, Sept. 4: “Political analysts watching the Obama administration’s pullback from the environmental agenda this past month say that in the current climate there is little chance that environmentalists or their allies will ever side with the Republicans. . . . Still, they say, the president could face political repercussions in subtler but nevertheless corrosive ways: from losing volunteer enthusiasm to tying up his allies in fights with him instead of with his enemies.”

Obama calls rival Perry over Texas wildfires

By  David Nakamura


Who says President Obama isn’t playing nice with his Republican rivals?
On Wednesday, Obama gave a ring to Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who also happens to be the leading Republican candidate aiming to take his job at the White House. 
Awkward.
But in this case, the call wasn’t political. Rather, Obama extended condolences to Perry for the worst wildfires in Texas history, which have killed four people and destroyed more than 1,000 homes in the past three days. 
The president also offered federal aid to the state and municipal governments, as they fight the fires, the White House said in a news release. Obama assured Perry “that requests for additional assistance, including as recovery begins, would be quickly assessed,” the statement read. 
There was no immediate reaction from Perry, who left the state Wednesday to fly to California to make his first appearance at a Republican presidential debate.  
In April, Perry blasted Obama for declaring Alabama an emergency disaster zone after tornadoes killed 200, while the president did not do the same for the Lone Star state despite wildfires raging across 2 million acres that month. 
“Why are you taking care of Alabama, why are you taking care of other states,” Perry asked then. “The letter didn’t get lost in the mail.”

Teamsters’ Hoffa stands by Labor Day remarks about tea party

By  David Nakamura


Your Browser DoesNot Support IFrames.
[This post has been updated to include an ellipses in a quote by Teamsters’ Leader Jimmy Hoffa. His full remarks at a Labor Day rally in Detroit were: “President Obama, this is your army. We are ready to march. And President Obama we want one thing: Jobs. Jobs. Jobs. Jobs. Jobs. Jobs. Jobs. Jobs. That’s what we’re going to tell him. He’s going to be - and when he sees what we’re doing here he will be inspired. But he needs help and you know what? Everybody here’s got to vote. If we go back and keep the eye on the prize, let’s take these [expletive] out and give America back to America where we belong!”]
Tea party groups called on him to apologize, but Teamsters’ boss Jimmy Hoffa kept to the remarks he made at a Labor Day rally in Detroit on Monday in which he called on workers to “take out” tea party members.
“We didn’t start this war – the right wing did,” Hoffa said in a statement Tuesday. “My comments on Labor Day in Detroit echo the anger and frustration of American workers who are under attack by corporate-funded politicians who want to destroy the middle class. We’re tired of seeing good-paying jobs shipped overseas. This fight is about the economy, it’s about jobs, and it’s about rebuilding America. As I said yesterday in Detroit, we all have to vote in order to take these anti-worker politicians out of office.”
At the Monday rally of 13,000 workers, where President Obama also spoke, Hoffa charged that there was a “war” on organized labor by the tea party, and he called on union members to fight on behalf of the president. 
“The one thing about working people is we like a good fight,” Hoffa told the crowd. “And you know what? They’ve got a war, they got a war with us, and there’s only going to be one winner. It’s going to be the workers of Michigan, and America. We’re going to win that war.”
Hoffa added: “President Obama, this is your army. We are ready to march. . . .Let’s take these [expletive] out and give America back to an America where we belong.”
Some tea party groups and conservative commentators have decried the remarks as violent and demanded that Hoffa and Obama apologize. Obama, who spoke later in the program, was not on stage during Hoffa’s speech.
Asked about Hoffa’s comments at his daily briefing Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney called the brouhaha “Kabuki theater.”
“Those weren’t comments by the president,” Carney said. 
“I understand there’s a ritual in Washington where someone says something and you link the associations and anyone who has an association with him or her has to avow or disavow. The president wasn’t onstage. He did not speak for another 20 minutes. He didn’t hear it. Mr. Hoffa speaks for himself, speaks for the labor movement.”
Carney mistakenly referred to Hoffa as the head of the AFL-CIO.  Richard Trumka, the AFL-CIO president, also spoke at the Labor Day event after Hoffa and before Obama. Trumka has not commented on Hoffa’s remarks. 
In the statement, Hoffa said: “We’re fighting back. That’s what Teamsters do – we stand up for what is right. I will never apologize for standing up for my fellow Teamsters and all American workers.”

Obama’s helicopter to Camp David diverted by bad weather

By  David Nakamura


All those metaphors about President Obama’s presidency being blown off-course by strong headwinds from his political opponents got a little too literal Friday afternoon.Obama was headed to Camp David on Marine One, his presidential helicopter, for a two-day respite from Washington when bad weather diverted the aircraft to an alternate location, a White House spokesman said.“Due to a last-minute bad weather call made prior to the his departure, Marine One diverted to an alternate landing area and the President motorcaded the rest of the way to Camp David,” deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.Continue reading this post »

August jobs report is more bad news for Obama

By  David Nakamura


(This was updated at 12:58 p.m.)New data released Friday that showed job growth at a standstill last month signaled more bad news for President Obama as he prepares to deliver a high-stakes speech to Congress on boosting the economy next week. 
Labor Department figures showed zero net jobs created in August and unemployment holding steady at 9.1 percent. Black unemployment  rose from 15.9 percent to 16.7 percent. “Clearly, faster growth is needed to replace the jobs lost in the downturn,” Katharine Abraham, a member of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisors, said in a statement released by the administration. “Next week, the President will lay out a series of additional bipartisan steps that Congress can take immediately to put more money in the paychecks of working and middle class families; to make it easier for small businesses to hire workers; to put construction crews to work rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure; and other measures that will help the economy grow while still reducing our deficit and getting our fiscal house in order.”Obama was scheduled to leave for Camp David on Friday for two days before heading to Paterson, N.J., on Sunday to see the damage caused by Hurricane Irene last week. The president, who had been scheduled to leave the White House at 10 a.m., delayed his departure  for 2 1/2 hours, though his aides did not explain why.Shortly after 12:30 p.m., Obama, walking with daughter Sasha, boarded his Marine One helicopter without saying anything about the jobs report to reporters who were watching.“Today’s disappointing unemployment report is further proof that President Obama has failed,” GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney said in a statement. “President Obama oversaw an economy that created zero jobs last month and that is unacceptable. In order to change the direction of this country, we need to change presidents.”In his own statement, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said: “The only acceptable jobs report is one that shows unemployment falling and Americans going back to work.” 
Obama will present his jobs plan to a special joint session of Congress at 7 p.m. Thursday. It comes at a critical time.Continue reading this post »

Obama speech sets high stakes for country, drawing comparison to Carter address

By  David Nakamura


An embattled president in his third year. A nation in doubt. A tough re-election campaign looming. A big speech to the nation.President Obama in September 2011? Yes, but also President Jimmy Carter in 1979, during the midst of a national energy crisis, with public confidence low and his own political fortunes ebbing.
Carter’s speech, delivered in the Oval Office, attempted to signal a cultural shift, as the president identified a “crisis of confidence” in the nation and called on Americans to embrace a new personal philosophy of restraint and self-discipline.“It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will,” a solemn-looking Carter said. “We can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation.”The address came to be known as the “malaise speech,” even though Carter didn’t use that word.Obama is not Carter. But when asked if there were historical parallels between the high stakes Obama is facing in his big jobs speech to Congress at 7 p.m. next Thursday, some presidential historians made the connection to Carter’s moment three decades ago.Continue reading this post »

Obama declares emergency in wildfire-affected Texas
12:43 • 10.09.11



US President Barack Obama has declared a state of emergency in Texas, making federal funding available to those affected by wildfires in Bastrop County, CNN reported.

"Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster," the White House said in a statement.

The declaration Friday night comes after Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst expressed frustration with the lack of response from the federal government.

Texas urgently needs federal help, Dewhurst has said. 

Nearly 1,400 homes have been destroyed in Bastrop County since wildfires started there about a week ago, Dewhurst said.
Other major fires are burning in Cass, Grimes, Montgomery, Travis and Waller counties, according to the Texas Forest Service.

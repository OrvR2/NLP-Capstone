King: Congress Hearings Must Embarrass White House on Immigration Amnesty

Comments


A key House Republican is calling for congressional hearings into President Obama’s decision to grant “administrative amnesty” by pulling out hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens already in the deportation pipeline. “This is another effort on the part of the President to ignore the will of Congress, ignore the rule of law and ignore his own oath of office,” said Rep. Steve King (R. -Iowa), vice chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration and policy enforcement. “The President is on the verge of being lawless himself,” King told HUMAN EVENTS. “It’s politically motivated because they think this will get them the Hispanic vote,” King said. The Obama administration last week announced its new strategy to deal with the 10 million people who are in the U.S. illegally. “It’s clear that we can’t deport such a large number,” said Cecilia Muñoz, White House director of intergovernmental affairs. “So, [the Homeland Security Department] along with the Department of Justice, will be reviewing the current deportation caseload to clear out low-priority cases on a case-by-case basis and make more room to deport people who have been convicted of crimes or pose a security risk.  And they will take steps to keep low-priority cases out of the deportation pipeline in the first place,” Muñoz said. King said Congress has limited powers in what it can do to force the Obama administration to adhere to immigration laws, but that it can cut funding to the departments involved “to send a powerful message to the White House.  Or, we can hold hearings and bring them forward to publicly humiliate them until they become politically vulnerable, and at that point, Obama might withdraw such a position,” King said. “We could also file a lawsuit, but if Obama is willing to defy the law, he’s perfectly capable of defying the court too,” King said. Citing the oath each President must swear when taking office, King said Obama pledged to faithfully “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” “He’s faithfully repealing legislation, he is de facto repealing immigration law.  He is redefining the law and deciding not to enforce it,” King said.  “He’s advertising to potential illegal aliens in foreign countries to come here to America, and if it’s not convenient to you, you will not be deported,” King said. “To let this go undermines our country.  It’s the law, and he needs to enforce the law,” King said.

Jay Carney’s ‘shuck-and-jive.’

Hey.  It’s a direct quote, OK?
Alternate title: Jay Carney is starting to crack under the strain.

Two thoughts about this:

Apparently – and contra Andrew Cuomo – you can shuck and jive at an Obama press conference after all.
I do not look forward with some interest to seeing how Pam Spaulding of Pandagon (and the above Huffington Post/Talking Points Memo writer, and every other person who freaked out about the Cuomo thing during the 2008 election) manages the mental readjustment necessary to simultaneously excuse attacking a white Hillary Clinton supporter for using the term then, while forgiving a white Obama staffer for using the term now. That’s because I can’t see how such a readjustment can be done without some form of trepanning.

Hey. Live by the hardline attitude on language, die by it. Not my fault.

But is he “a’pickin’ and a’grinnin’”?
“Gloom–despair–and agony on me . . .
Deep, dark depression, excessive misery . . .
If it weren’t fer bad luck I’d have no luck at all . . .
Gloom–despair–and agony on meeeeee . . .”

The background is from Maxfield Parrish's Ecstasy, and is (to the best to my knowledge) in the public domain.

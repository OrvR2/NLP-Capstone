Dozens of blazes currently burning throughout Texas were seen from the International Space Station on the 6th August 2011. Nearly 200 miles up huge plumes of smoke were clearly visible over the state.

Check out my vid about the South Texas Fire Debacle. My friend lives just south of Bastrop where the fires were﻿ heading and he had been fighting fires for 2 days. After he told me how red tape and forest officials treated him it's a wonder the fires are contained, had it not been for the winds dying down over these last 2 days they would be in deep shit about now...

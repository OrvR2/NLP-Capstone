October 20, 2008--BASTROP, Texas--Firefighters from across the nation will be in Bastrop County for the 11th Annual Capital Area Interagency Wildfire Academy Oct. 21-Nov. 3.
“We’re expecting a great response to this training as it is now the second largest in America,” said Rich Gray, academy founder. “More than 600 firefighters from local fire departments, as well as state and federal agencies will train here in the next two weeks.”
Students will learn and practice basic wildland firefighting. Courses include helicopter operations, wildland power saws, dozer operations, ignition operations, emergency vehicle operations, fire investigation, incident command system, fire prevention education, tactical decision making in wildfire and basic wildland firefighting.
The popularity of the wildfire academy is largely due to the knowledge base in the instructors.  “Our success can be easily tracked,” said Les Rogers, Incident Commander for the academy. “By looking at the number of students who came here as novices and are now instructors.” 
The Capital Area Interagency Wildfire Academy is a coordinated effort by the Texas Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, Texas Army National Guard, National Weather Service, Bastrop County Office of Emergency Management, The Nature Conservancy and local fire departments. Active fire seasons and multiple hurricanes in recent years have highlighted the need for specialized training for responders at all levels.
A memorial service will be held to honor the 95 firefighters have lost their lives in the line of duty this year and to stress the dangerous nature of firefighting.

HR Mapping Disaster


 
 From Crisis to Community: Mapping as a Peacebuilding Tool 
 Catherine Graham - Thursday, July 07, 2011 
 





"There has been a surge of enthusiasm and activity around crisis mapping recently, thanks to high profile success stories such as Haiti, Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt, and Kenya. But, as the field matures, how do we turn this information into insight that engages and empowers  local communities in conflict prevention and peacebuilding?  On June 17, 2011, USIP and Ushahidi, the crisis mapping pioneer, explored these questions with mappers from conflict zone countries and policymakers in Washington, D.C."

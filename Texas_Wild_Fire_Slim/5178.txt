Site for 9/11 ceremony damaged in earthquakeBy Kwala Mandel | The Upshot – Tue, Aug 23, 2011

The Washington National Cathedral was described as a "sacred national gathering place for mourning, reflection and prayer" in the days after the 9/11 attack. The significant site is currently scheduled to host a series of 9/11 anniversary events, including an Alan Jackson performance on Sept. 11. However, the cathedral was among the national landmarks hit by Tuesday's 5.8 earthquake.

The cathedral was evacuated and the damage is still being assessed, but at least three of the four spires on the gothic-style central tower have broken off, says a spokesperson. He also confirms the fourth, central tower is now leaning. "There was other minor structural damages to buttresses and smaller pinnacles," says the cathedral's Director of Communications Richard Weinberg.
The cathedral is built out of limestone blocks and is solid stone. No update on whether the damage will impact memorial plans.

God has cursed the USA. That church will collapse when the demons congregate in their devil's coven on the anniversary of their orgy of death. The USA is an open cesspool and a sewer. Floods, earthquakes, fires and plagues will afflict the evil USA. Birds will fall fromt he sky and fish will boil, dead in the sea. No one will survive the judgment in the Nazi USA.

I want to know why the majority of us do not care what happen to WTC Building 7? Are we, as Americans, really that apathetic?

First the atheists are suing over a cross being raised on the site and now religious leaders are not being invited to 911 ceremonies, thanks to the NY mayor, but they planned a concert in the National Cathedral?  Maybe God got a little ticked off and decided if no religious leaders were allowed to speak then no one could use the cathedral.   

The NY mayor supports the building of a mosque but refuses to recognize that there are many people attending that need the comfort of their spiritual leaders as they remember their loved ones who lost their lives.  So who complained to the mayor and won his support, the muslims or the atheists or maybe both?

Is America going to memorialize the children's book George "Dumya" Bush was reading out loud?  He picked that specific class to read to because any grade higher than that class was/is 150+% smarter than him!

May be it is the conspiracy or another terror plot by the Muslim Center coming up near this monument..... I am sure the innocent blood spilt by the murderers will not go waste and the real perpetrator who ever they are would never sleep well in their graves when ever they get there off course.................. They know who they are.......

What do we need a 9/11 "ceremony" for anyway?  Do we have Challenger explosion ceremonies, or horrible fire ceremonies?  This 9/11 crap is really getting old--10 years old already. Enough of this whining and wallowing in self pity. Move on!

So every year i have to see this stuff but they cannot release Osama's dead picture for fear of "upsetting" the "rioting" middle east. Makes perfect sense, after all that is our government at work.

9/11 was a inside job! Be prepared for another false flag and they are going to blame it on another country. They are taking away our freedoms slowly. Wake up America and don't trust the President or Perry, Bachmann ,Romney. They are not going to change anything they will make it worse.

Crappy construction!
I take this as a sign that Gawd wants truth and respect for those who lost their lives - not just prayer and Alan Jackson (who I hope you all realized was just capitalizing on this tragedy to make money. I loathe him.)
Nothing against prayers or anything...

I can't believe speculators didn't find a way to jack up the price of crude! They need SOME new excuse now that they can't use Libya anymore.

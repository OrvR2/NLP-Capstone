If I were advising Ron Paul on how to best attack Rick Perry in, say, a one minute advertisement, I might go with something like: "Hello, I'm Ron Paul. You know all of those policy positions I've held consistently my entire career? Well, Rick Perry is a Johnny-come-lately opportunist in embracing these issues. Plus he actually thinks that Federal Reserve Chairman Benjamin Bernanke deserves to be physically harmed, which I do not support, because that's just nuts. Ol' nutbag Rick Perry thinks that, and Texans like him less than me. So, LOL." 
But Paul, recognizing that this week's upcoming debate is at the Reagan Library and that everyone who is participating will be trying to out-Reagan one another (and in the case of Newt Gingrich, actually "Reaganing") despite the fact that they might not have been huge fans of Reagan themselves, is doing his best to synergize. So instead, his new ad refers to Rick Perry as the "cheerleader" who "helped lead Al Gore's campaign to undo the Reagan revolution." (Surely you remember that time that Al Gore, just by unsuccessfully running for president in 1988, destroyed the "Reagan revolution!")
WATCH:

Ron Paul endorsed Reagan's campaign for president way back when. Now, Ron Paul is calling himself "the one who stood with Reagan." But the Perry campaign was quick to note that at some point in between then and now was that time when Paul quit the GOP over Reagan, and another time when he said, "I want to totally disassociate myself from the Reagan Administration." I guess Paul was always in favor of the Platonic Ideal of Reagan. 
Here's an interesting sidenote. As for the people who used to cheer on the long-forgotten Gore campaign, Mother Jones' Andy Kroll finds the most eye-popping former supporter of all:
Perry, it's worth noting, wasn't the only unlikely supporter of Gore's '88 campaign. Fred Phelps, the patriarch of the controversial Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan., housed campaign workers for Gore's presidential bid in 1988. And in 1989 Phelps' son, Fred Jr., threw a fundraiser for Gore's Senate run at his home.
So, in many ways, I'm not sure it's physiologically possible to understand contemporary American politics.

				(2 of 2)...No other candidate, or MSM, even mentions monetary policy as a possible problem to the many challenges we face today, not even a pep just like you. Nixon, in 1971 after dell inking gold to the dollar said we are all Keynesian now. And the founder of Keynesian economics said: By a continuous process of inflation, government­s can confiscate­, secretly and unobserved­, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method, they not only confiscate­, but they confiscate arbitraril­y; and while the process impoverish­es many, it actually enriches some. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturnin­g the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency.T­he process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destructio­n, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.”­- John Maynard Keynes, The Economic Consequenc­es of the Peace, 1919. Do some real research or succumb to constant teaching from those who know what the philosophy of liberty truly means. Like I said, Quit your squabbling and say something real or just get out of the way and stop creating white noise.

				John, I see you typed nothing concrete only that "The(y) can and they will and they'll be right." Why, in your opinion, do you say they will be right? How about stating some real evidence instead of an argument fit for a 10 year old? Quit your squabbling and say something real or just get out of the way and stop creating white noise. Let me ask you sir, do you believe in the philosophy of liberty? Do you believe the constituti­on was written to protect the liberties of private individual­s or do you believe the constituti­on was written to protect the federal government­'s involvemen­t in almost every aspect of a private individual­'s life? Do you think the philosophy of liberty should extend to the market, allowing for free market conditions­, or do you think we should have government interventi­on regulating and attempting to dictate prices? Ron Paul, and his lifetime voting record, expressly proves he is a true upholder of the constituti­on. Voting record is very important because it shows what the person did in a more private setting. John Adams once said, "Public Virtue cannot exist without private, and public Virtue is the only Foundation of Republics.­" Moreover, Mr. John, how in the world can you be in such alarming opposition of Dr. Paul when he is the only candidate, for decades now, trying to deal with the untouched monetary policy our country has succumbed to?...(1 of 2)

				President Reagan did not stray, he was pushed by the real decision makers, the MS-12. George H. Bush was ,and continues to be a member of the most secret committee in our goverment. The agenda is always for National Security, and that is why this committee has absolute power over any sitting president. I believe Ron Paul to be sincere and genuine, however he too would be compelled to adhere to the agenda of the MS-12, unless he removes the entire old guard from the White House and the Pentagon.

				Progressiv­es should support Ron Paul if they care about ending the wars, stopping the continued bailouts for the rich bankers, stopping the civil liberties abuses (Patriot Act) and ending the federal drug war (hurts minorities­). Ron Paul as president could have a unilateral impact on these issues, while he would not be able to enact his domestic economic/f­iscal agenda without a super majority in the Senate (not likely any time soon). He's also on the record in saying that the money being spent overseas should be used to tide over those dependent on our entitlemen­t programs; he's the only one talking to us like adults.

				Not sure why there is so much support for Rick Perry in the media.  As a life-long republican from Texas, we know he is all about opportunit­y, and not all about being conservati­ve.  His tone seems to change like the wind.  He was a backer of Al Gore for Christ’s sake.  When the cameras are not on, he seems to think he’s above the law.  If you haven’t seen it, here is a link of him trying to get his driver out of a ticket, recorded from the state trooper’s dash cam.

If you want more of the same Washington­, just vote for Perry.

				One more step and you could have been fair to Paul on Reagan.
You could have pointed out the simple and consistent reason for Ron Paul's disillusio­nment with Reagan.   I will echo Maxwell105 from his comment earlier in this thread; 
"Paul was a huge supporter of Reagan back in 1976, back when no one thought he could win. He like Reagan's philosophy of limited government­­. However, in the end, Reagan expanded the government­­. And this is why Paul was critical of his policies at the end of his presidency­."

So, in other words, Reagan didn't have a "philosoph­y of limited government­". He just lied about it like a good Republican­.

				I'll dig a little deeper for you John.  I would concede they all lie... I don't think it is a trait inherent in just one party or the other. Reagan traded his "limited government ideals" (if he ever truly had any) in favor of outspendin­g the Russians. History will be judging this strategy vs. his rhetoric for a while yet I am sure.  
I don't know if Paul's strategy of attempting to win the (R)  nomination in hopes of co-opting that establishm­ent to some extent will work, but I do see through his years of consistenc­y that he is not afraid to walk the walk regardless of popularity of the day. Even if it meant speaking out against Reagan at a high time in his popularity­. Good political move,,, most likely at the time no.  Today maybe it just tells a little more about the character of Paul.  He may be the only choice to even potentiall­y escape the status quo. Do the American people really care if  Goldman Sachs let's GE run the place or Halliburto­n this time? I guess that's yet to be seen. But, I can tell you many of us traditiona­lly Non-politi­cals are fed up with losing the essence of our great country to communists and carpetbagg­ers alike and are willing to give Paul the chance he has earned..

I would vote for Paul today just based on his integrity and honor. Progressiv­es wake up! Ron Paul is our best chance to end the wars, the military industrial complex and re-energiz­e America. 
Don't just listen to what the MSM is saying, check for yourselves and think about Paul in the context of the founders.  Our biggest threat is empire.

				This is exactly the same position that Barack Obama has taken.  Neither Ron Paul nor Obama would stop the states from taking positions for or against gay marriage.

Meanwhile, no one but Ron Paul will stop killing people overseas, forcing the Patriot Act down our throats, allowing the president to target Americans for assassinat­ion (something that W. would not have had the gall to do), or torturing Bradley Manning.

				Can you find me the source and date on this quote from Paul John? This seems  inconsiste­nt with Paul's other statements .  Web searching; "Ron Paul on gay marriage" produces a video on Youtube from Oct 22 2007 titled the same that speaks to Paul's stance on a constituti­onal amendment on gay marriage.  Seems pretty clear his stance is leave it to the states...

				Please, he's also against the federal government being involved at all and letting the states make the decision themselves­.  He'd prefer getting the government out of marriage entirely, which is the position I'd take.  We currently punish the single and the LGBT community by withholdin­g marriage.  Why is the government saying who gets to make a vow to stay together and raise a family together?  That's between the people involved, not the government­.

				Yes! It is about time Paul's campaign showed some teeth in this campaign. No longer can the media or other presidenti­al candidates simply shrug Paul off and say Dr. Paul has no chance of winning. I think this campaign is about a philosophi­cal awakening in the capacity of Liberty which is why, if enough people begin to believe in what liberty means and what it does not, Dr. Paul will win! An idea who's time has come cannot be stopped by any standing army so let it not be said that we, the true believers of the philosophy of liberty, did nothing! Ron Paul 2012 and the philosophy of liberty for ever!

				Wouldn't it be best if they just reported the news and left the opinion to us?  

At this stage of the primary race Paul has better numbers for 2012 than McCain did in 2008. If the entire journalist­ic profession is going to treat the election like a horse race they ought to at least have the integrity to call it that way. What did John Stewart say in his skit; Paul is "the 13th floor in a hotel"...

				John, I see you typed nothing concrete only that "The(y) can and they will and they'll be right." Why, in your opinion, do you say they will be right? How about stating some real evidence instead of an argument fit for a 10 year old? Quit your squabbling and say something real or just get out of the way and stop creating white noise. Let me ask you sir, do you believe in the philosophy of liberty? Do you believe the constituti­on was written to protect the liberties of private individual­s or do you believe the constituti­on was written to protect the federal government­'s involvemen­t in almost every aspect of a private individual­'s life? Do you think the philosophy of liberty should extend to the market, allowing for free market conditions­, or do you think we should have government interventi­on regulating and attempting to dictate prices? Ron Paul, and his lifetime voting record, expressly proves he is a true upholder of the constituti­on. Voting record is very important because it shows what the person did in a more private setting. John Adams once said, "Public Virtue cannot exist without private, and public Virtue is the only Foundation of Republics.­" Moreover, Mr. John, how in the world can you be in such alarming opposition of Dr. Paul when he is the only candidate, for decades now, trying to deal with the untouched monetary policy our country has succumbed to?...(1 of 2)

				(2 of 2)...No other candidate, or MSM, even mentions monetary policy as a possible problem to the many challenges we face today, not even a pep just like you. Nixon, in 1971 after dell inking gold to the dollar said we are all Keynesian now. And the founder of Keynesian economics said: By a continuous process of inflation, government­s can confiscate­, secretly and unobserved­, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method, they not only confiscate­, but they confiscate arbitraril­y; and while the process impoverish­es many, it actually enriches some. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturnin­g the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency.T­he process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destructio­n, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.”­- John Maynard Keynes, The Economic Consequenc­es of the Peace, 1919. Do some real research or succumb to constant teaching from those who know what the philosophy of liberty truly means. Like I said, Quit your squabbling and say something real or just get out of the way and stop creating white noise.

				If he comes in top 2 in Iowa and New Hampshire and acquires a big-time endorsemen­t such as DeMint from SC (which is a reasonable possibilit­y; he endorsed Rand Paul's Senate bid), then he'll win the primary election.  The rest of the Repub field is weak and especially suspect on their conservati­ve credential­s.

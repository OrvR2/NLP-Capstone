Magnitude 5.5 quake rocks S. Philippines










MANILA, Philippines (Xinhua) â€” A magnitude 5.5 earthquake hit southern Philippines Wednesday afternoon, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said.
The epicenter of the quake which struck from a depth of 100 kilometers was traced 56 kilometers east of the southern Philippine province of Surigao, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

Phivolcs said the quake was of tectonic origin and warned of possible aftershocks. No one was reported harmed and there was no reported damages to property.
The Philippines sits in the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, an area where continental plates collide producing frequent quakes and volcanic activities.

This Is How Insanely Fast the Texas Wildfires Are Spreading

 The place: North of Bastrop State Park, Texas. The time: September 5, 2011. The bottom line: wildfires spread so insanely fast that it's terrifying. This has not been altered in any way. It's real time.
Wildfires have been roaring for the past eight days, powered by winds reaching up to 60 miles per hour. As of September 6, the Bastrop fire has destroyed an estimated 600 homes already, advancing through a 16-mile front. More than 1,000 homes and 115,000 acres have been destroyed so far. [Texas Parks & Wildlife, NOAA and Earthsky via This Is Colossal]

Gawker Media Community Policy

These are our sites, and we reserve the right to moderate the discussion. The basic rules are standard: An attack on authors or other commenters is unlikely to make you popular. Think before you disparage social or ethnic groups. Don't spam. Don't post pornography or copyrighted imagery. Stay on topic. 


That said, the community policy of Gawker Media is forgiving. If your criticism is articulate, it will likely get through. We dole it out; we can take it. What do we mean by articulate? Support your point with argument, facts and citations. Good grammar and spelling also help.

Got questions? Need answers? See our FAQ and site-specific community guidelines.

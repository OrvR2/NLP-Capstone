A city councilmember and a city aide who were detained by the NYPD during Monday's West Indian Day parade in Brooklyn say the incident never would have happened if they were white. 
Coucilman Jumaane Williams (D-Brooklyn),  and Kirsten John Foy, a top aide to city public advocate Bill de Blasio, told reporters at a press conference Tuesday morning that they were walking on a blocked-off sidewalk Monday afternoon when uniformed cops confronted them, The New York Times reports.  
Williams and Foy claim to have previously been given permission to walk on the sidewalk by another, higher-ranking police officer while on their way to a post-parade event at the Brooklyn Museum. 

The two city officials, both of whom are black, say they tried to show their city IDs to officers but their efforts were ignored.
An argument ensued until cops eventually threw Williams and Foy to the ground and handcuffed them (see video below). After 30 minutes, and once their identities were confirmed, the two men were released. 
At the press conference Tuesday morning outside City Hall and joined by City Council Speaker Christine Quinn along with other officials, Williams said his and Foy's arrests as a form of racial profiling, which he says has been exacerbated by the department’s stop-question-and frisk policies that unfairly target blacks and latinos. 
According to The New York Post, Williams said he thinks the incident happened because he is a “35-year-old black man with dreadlocks.”
A federal judge recently OK'd a lawsuit accusing the NYPD of discriminating against black and latino men with its stop-and-frisk policies aimed at reducing crime.
Williams also denied claims from NYPD spokesman Paul Browne that someone punched a police officer during the incident.
"Telling a bald-faced lie, particularly to the people that they're lying about disturbs me," Williams said. "How can we take seriously what the police will say in the future if they will lie to us about this. I defy the police to find one shred of evidence of any police officer punched in that incident."
U.S. Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-Brooklyn) took Williams' criticism further, going so far as to compare civil rights in New York to South African Apartheid.
"Each and every day, we're hearing more and more about the violation of civil liberties in this town," she said, according to The New York Daily News. "We are quickly moving to an apartheid situation here in the city of New York where we don't recognize the civil liberties and the civil rights of all New Yorkers."
Both Mayor Michael Bloomberg and police commissioner Ray Kelly have formally apologized to Williams and Foy, and Kelly says he's launched an investigations into the arrests.

				Shameful but who are they getting their orders from? 
Totalitari­anism (or totalitari­an rule) is a political system where the state recognizes no limits to its authority and strives to regulate every aspect of public and private life wherever feasible.
Looks like NYC is forgetting what country its in or at least what country it used to be.

				I agree with Jumaane that this would not have happened if he had been white. If he had been white he would not have been acting "the fool". He wouldn't have believed that he was "special" and the rules don't apply to him. If he had permission to be on the blocked off sidewalk, he would have had proof of that permission­, had he been a responsibl­e white city councilmem­ber. It's really not that tough to understand an officers point of view, it only takes maturity rather than emotion. That and acting like a grownup.

				What a racist thing to say!  How was he "acting the fool?" So if he were white he would have had proof of permission­, but since he is black he doesn't? At no point should anyone be thrown to the ground and handcuffed unless they pose immediate danger to the police or to the public.  It is not the police who worry me so much, as there are clearly more answers to be found - it is people like docpaws with their racist, bigoted attitude of "he's black so of course he is wrong" that are scary...

				What part of get out of the cops face don't people understand­.   Remedy:  Lets put all black officers at these type of events or in the black neighborho­ods and then the race card can't be used.  When a law enforcemen­t official gives a directive; you follow it.  Don't get in their face.

				sure, stopped because they're black... the fact that they were walking down a closed street, defying police orders to stop, had nothing to do with it...

puhleeez!  i'm a city attorney with an nypd i.d.... when i encounter a police block, i show my i.d. and ask to pass through... sometimes they say yes, sometimes they say no... when they say yes, i thank them, because they're doing me a courtesy..­. but when they say no, do i berate them, argue, and push my way past, like williams and foy did? of course not! the officers are following orders and have no obligation to give me special treatment, so i follow the detour, and if i feel like bitching about it i do so under my breath...


these two, however, ignored requests to stop, likely with a "do you know who i am" or two, and were released after their i.d. was confirmed.­.. they claimed that they had permission to pass through, that's inadequate­... most p.o.s won't risk being discipline­d by disobeying an order unless hearing it from the supervisin­g officer himself, so it doesn't even matter whether i.d.s were produced


i don't care who you are, you don't just push past cops who tell you to stop... if those two absolutely HAD to go down that particular street, they should have left and returned to the barricade with the supervisin­g officer who allegedly gave them permission to go through..

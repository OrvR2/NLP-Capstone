          When people go to a showing for Betsey JohnsonBetsey Johnson they know that they’re in for a fun-filled treat. Such was the case for the Betsey Johnson Spring 2012 fashion show during New York’s Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week at The Theater at Lincoln Center on September 12, 2011. The models were a splash of color and gaiety as they presented Betsey Johnson’s playful creations for Spring 2012.  There were her usual roses and florals, hot pink and chartreuse green, with a good dose of glitter and skulls, as seen on the sexy swimsuit, often paired with metallic Doc Marten boots. Hip hop and R&B recording artist Nicki MinajNicki Minaj also got fitted backstage for one of Betsey’s more colorful creations, which she accessorized with turquoise bow-embellished pumps and a mint green wig! Minaj sat in the audience with Olympic figure skater Johnny WeirJohnny Weir, model Jessica Hart, and writer Lynn Yaeger with her russet tresses. High Society girl Tinsley Mortimer was also there with photographer Nigel Barker by her side as she posed for photos – but not by Mortimer, who was one of the attendees! Style maven Fern Mallis also mixed it up backstage with the likes of Angela Simmons, who is also working on her own clothing line called Angela Renee. At the end of the show, Betsey came out with daughter Lulu and when designer Betsey Johnson comes out at the end of the fashion show, she doesn’t just take a humble bow, she does the splits as if caressing the catwalk out of gratitude! Enjoy the slideshow of the freshest creations for Spring 2012 by the unique Betsey Johnson as presented at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York!        1 of 39

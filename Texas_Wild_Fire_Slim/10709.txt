Hey you. Bored? Of course you are. Look at you, sitting at your desk on a Wednesday afternoon, begging the Internet to throw you a bone. Some sort of distraction.
Well don't worry, bud, we've got you covered. So take a break from thinking about the Gosselins and going commando, and take a look at these sites. They're the cream of the crop.
As always, be sure to vote for your favorites and let us know if you come across any awesome new time-wasters that you think we should feature.

Celebs With No Eyebrows is a single-topic Tumblr that takes photos of celebrities and photoshops the eyebrows out. The results are pretty bizarre.

				Some of those eyebrow pics just did not look right w/o eyebrows. Thought there was other photoshopp­ing going on, but wasn't sure until I got to the Browlysha Nett pic (woman eating hamburger in a see through bra). I noticed (quite innocently­... ahem) that the piercing in her nipple disappeare­d in the second pic. How much other slight changes were made in order for the pic to look more different than it might otherwise?

				What fascinates me about the eyebrows is how on most people, it doesn't make much difference­.

But with some celebritie­s, losing the eyebrows make them nearly unrecogniz­able:  Leonardo DiCaprio, Peter Gallagher, Colin Farrell, and Mila Kunis--jus­t to pick some out.

Allstate's Safe Teen Driving Initiative Reaches Major Milestone
Facebook/Save11 Fan Page Continues to Garner National Grassroots Support<br /><strong>This release contains: 1 Photo, 1 Related Document</strong><p>Allstate's efforts to save the lives of teen drivers reached a new milestone with the registration of its 100,000th Facebook fan. Allstate's facebook.com/save11 fan page is designed to raise awareness that the number one killer of American teenagers is motor vehicle crashes, killing an average of eleven teens per day.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled that 100,000 people have joined our cause to make our roads safer for teen drivers," said Bill Vainisi, senior vice president and deputy general counsel, Allstate Insurance Company. "The viral movement generated by Allstate's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Save11" target="_blank">Save 11</a> Campaign has produced a chorus of advocates across the country seeking to enact graduated driver licensing laws that will protect and prepare America's youngest drivers."</p>
<p>Designed to put a real, human face on the issue, facebook.com/save11 encourages consumers to get involved, contact their lawmakers, invite family and friends to take action, and lend their voices to the vital movement.</p>
<p>Allstate supports the Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection (STANDUP) Act that encourages states to implement minimum graduated drivers license (GDL) law standards. Research has shown that optimum GDL laws are proven to save 16 and 17-year-old drivers in the 20 percent to 40 percent range.</p>
<p>The company is deeply committed to reducing teen deaths and making roads safer for all Americans and believes the collective voice of citizens in every corner of the country can help <em>Save 11</em> teens each day. Allstate has been supporting the grassroots actions of consumers with an integrated national advocacy campaign that includes online, print and social media components, among other means to reach lawmakers and the public.</p>

Pro Football Hall of Fame and Allstate Insurance Announce Partnership to Honor "Hometown Hall of Famers" 
Program Recognizes Pro Football's Greatest Players in Their Hometown Communities<br /><strong>This release contains: 1 Related Document</strong><p>The Pro Football Hall of Fame and Allstate Insurance Company today announced "Hometown Hall of Famers," a national program that will honor the hometown roots of the sport's greatest players with special ceremonies and plaque dedication events in local communities.</p>
<p>"Hometown Hall of Famers presented by the Pro Football Hall of Fame and Allstate" is the Hall of Fame's first nationwide plaque program and will lead into the celebration of its 50th anniversary in August 2012.</p>
<p>The program will host its first event today where Hall of Fame member and national spokesperson Howie Long will be honored in his hometown of Charlestown, Mass. The former all-pro defensive end for the Oakland and Los Angeles Raiders will receive the commemorative plaque at the Charlestown Boys &amp; Girls Club. Long spent countless hours at the Boys &amp; Girls Club while growing up in the greater Boston area.</p>
<p>"Honoring the hometowns that helped create the foundation for Hall of Famers' pathway to the Hall will be truly special as these plaques will live forever in their hometown communities," said George Veras, Pro Football Hall of Fame Enterprises president and CEO. "The Hall of Fame is pleased that Allstate has recognized the significance of this program and given all of us &ndash; the players, their communities and the Pro Football Hall of Fame &ndash; a chance to celebrate the hometown stories of these legendary professional football players."</p>
<p>The Pro Football Hall of Fame and Allstate will host 10 events in the fall of 2011, and will honor as many as 50 Hall of Famers in their hometowns in 2012. There will be a plaque dedication ceremony honoring former New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath in his hometown of Beaver Falls, Pa., on Sept. 12.</p>
<p>Other Hall of Fame members that will be recognized as part of the program in 2011 include Bart Starr (Montgomery, Ala.), Sonny Jurgensen (Wilmington, N.C.), Barry Sanders (Wichita, Kan.), John Madden (Daly City, Calif.), Walter Payton (Columbia, Miss.), Roger Staubach (Cincinnati) and George Halas (Chicago).</p>
<p>"To be part of a program that brings the prestige and tradition of the Pro Football Hall of Fame to cities and towns across America is an honor for Allstate, our agents and employees," said Beaver Falls, Pa. native Mark LaNeve, Allstate executive vice president, marketing and sales operations. "Allstate is proud to partner with the Pro Football Hall of Fame to keep alive and protect the hometown legacies of some of the most iconic names in pro football history."</p>
<p>Following each presentation, the plaques will live permanently at a designated local venue in the Hall of Famer's hometown community. In Charlestown, the plaque presented to Howie Long will live at the Boys &amp; Girls Club, while the Joe Namath plaque will be on display at City Hall in Beaver Falls. In select markets, the former players will also have commemorative "Hometown Hall of Famer" road signs displayed in their hometowns.</p>

<p>It's vital to listen to instructions from local authorities.

<li>If you don't have an up-to-date home inventory, walk through your home with a video or still camera. At the same time, make a list of what items you want to take during an evacuation. An inventory can help facilitate the claim process.</li>
<li>Contact your Allstate agent to determine whether your homeowners policy provides for additional living expenses if you've been evacuated from your home under mandatory orders.</li>
</ul>

Seventh Annual "Allstate America's Best Drivers Report™" Reveals Safest Driving Cities
Fort Collins, Colorado, wins top honor second year in a row<br /><strong>This release contains: 4 Videos, 5 Related Documents</strong><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Information:<br /></span></strong><a href="http://allstatenewsroom.com/releases/00c90674-c797-4dd0-82c8-3813ccbe1e1e:en-US/download/e3fc06ab-a016-4248-89ef-72454729bd0a">Best Drivers Data: 2011</a><br /><a href="http://allstatenewsroom.com/releases/00c90674-c797-4dd0-82c8-3813ccbe1e1e:en-US/download/53fa2b17-a504-46ec-9e76-8292e3133177">Best Drivers Data: 2005-2010</a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.allstatenewsroom.com/">Allstate Insurance Company</a> (NYSE: ALL) today released its seventh annual "Allstate America's Best Drivers Report&trade;." The report ranks America's 200 largest cities in terms of car collision frequency to identify which cities have the safest drivers, according to Allstate claim data.</p>
<p>This year's top honor of "America's Safest Driving City" is Fort Collins, Colo., the second year in the row for the city at the top spot. According to the report, the average driver in Fort Collins will experience an auto collision every 14 years, which is 28.6 percent less likely than the national average of 10 years.</p>
<p>"Allstate's Best Driver's Report was created to boost the country's discussion on safe driving. Each year we hope the report will increase awareness on the importance of being tolerant and attentive behind the wheel," said Mike Roche, executive vice president, Allstate's Claim Organization. "We want to recognize the city of Fort Collins for again being the safest driving city in America, and we salute all of America's safe drivers, who help make our communities better places to live, work and raise families."</p>
<p>Fort Collins city officials credit their residents with earning the safe driving recognition.</p>
<p>"For the second year in a row, we've earned the title of the safest driving city in America due to the responsible behavior and safe driving habits of our residents," said Fort Collins Mayor Karen Weitkunat. "Safety is a critical component to creating a world-class city; we have our residents to thank as they are undoubtedly the reason Fort Collins is one of the best places to live, work, and play. I'm honored to be a part of a community that is consistently recognized as one of the nation's best."</p>
<p>Auto crashes in general have declined over the last few years, but crash fatalities still average more than 32,000 every year despite technological advances, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
<p>"Human behavior is the biggest cause of accidents. It is vital for us to educate American drivers about safe driving behaviors they can demonstrate on the road that will help make our roadways safer," said Roche.</p>
<p>Allstate offers the following safe driving tips drivers should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Minimize distractions </em></strong>- Engaging in any other activity while driving - talking on your cell phone, text messaging, changing a radio station, putting on makeup - is a distraction. </li>
<li><strong><em>Be aware of road conditions </em></strong>- Ice, snow, fog, rain - all of these weather conditions require extra caution and slower speeds.</li>
<li><strong><em>Leave a safe distance between your car and others around you</em></strong> - Maintain at least one car length space between your car and the vehicle in front of you for every 10 miles per hour of speed.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Steer clear of road rage</em></strong> - Reduce stress on the road by allowing plenty of time for travel, planning your route in advance, and altering your schedule or route to avoid congested roads. Remember not to challenge aggressive drivers and stay as far away from them as possible.</li>
<li><strong><em>Maintenance matters</em></strong> - Ultimately, safety also depends on the maintenance of your car. Ensure that your car brakes, exhaust system, tires, lights, battery and hoses are in good working order.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Report</strong> <br /> For the past seven years, Allstate actuaries have conducted an in-depth analysis of company claim data to determine the likelihood drivers in America's 200 largest cities will experience a vehicle collision compared to the national average. Internal property damage reported claims were analyzed over a two-year period (from January 2008 to December 2009) to ensure the findings would not be impacted by external influences such as weather or road construction.</p>
<p>A weighted average of the two-year numbers determined the annual percentages. The report defines an auto crash as any collision resulting in a property damage claim. Allstate's auto policies represent about 10 percent of all U.S. auto policies, making this report a realistic snapshot of what's happening on America's roadways.</p>
<p>[Complete report available at <a href="http://www.allstatenewsroom.com/">www.allstatenewsroom.com</a>]</p>
<p><strong>The Top Ten</strong><br /> For the second time in the report's seven-year history, Fort Collins was revealed as the safest driving city.</p>

Remember not to challenge aggressive drivers and stay as far away from them as possible.</li>
<li><strong><em>Maintenance matters</em></strong> - Ultimately, safety also depends on the maintenance of your car. Ensure that your car brakes, exhaust system, tires, lights, battery and hoses are in good working order.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Report</strong> <br /> For the past seven years, Allstate actuaries have conducted an in-depth analysis of company claim data to determine the likelihood drivers in America's 200 largest cities will experience a vehicle collision compared to the national average. Internal property damage reported claims were analyzed over a two-year period (from January 2008 to December 2009) to ensure the findings would not be impacted by external influences such as weather or road construction.</p>
<p>A weighted average of the two-year numbers determined the annual percentages. The report defines an auto crash as any collision resulting in a property damage claim. Allstate's auto policies represent about 10 percent of all U.S. auto policies, making this report a realistic snapshot of what's happening on America's roadways.</p>
<p>[Complete report available at <a href="http://www.allstatenewsroom.com/">www.allstatenewsroom.com</a>]</p>
<p><strong>The Top Ten</strong><br /> For the second time in the report's seven-year history, Fort Collins was revealed as the safest driving city.</p>

Be Aware of Contractor Fraud Following Hurricane Irene
Important hurricane rebuilding Information <br /><strong>This release contains: 1 Related Document</strong><p>Allstate Insurance (NYSE: ALL) reminds homeowners affected by Hurricane Irene to be on the look out for potentially fraudulent contractors as they begin the repair and rebuilding process.</p>
<p>A good, trustworthy contractor can be a key partner in the rebuilding process. However, fraudulent contractors may take advantage of people who have recently experienced a catastrophic event.</p>
<p>Ten Tips to Avoid Getting Scammed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take your time in choosing a contractor to repair your home.</li>
<li>Get estimates from several licensed, bonded contractors.</li>
<li>Check their credentials with your local Better Business Bureau or Home Builders Association.</li>
<li>Inspect contractors&rsquo; licenses and proof of liability insurance.</li>
<li>Avoid paying money up-front. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some</span> reputable contractors will require partial, up-front payment, but these pre-work payments shouldn&rsquo;t exceed the cost of materials or 20 percent of the total estimate.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Follow local building codes and inspection procedures.</li>
<li>If anyone performs unauthorized work on your house or property and demands payment, consider contacting local authorities.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t sign over an insurance settlement check to the contractor.</li>
<li>Immediately report any suspicious behavior to your local police, sheriff&rsquo;s department or your state&rsquo;s Department of Insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Allstate policyholders who have damage as a result of Hurricane Irene can file a claim by contacting their agent, calling <strong>1-800-54-STORM</strong> (1-800-547-8676), visiting a <strong>Mobile Claims Center</strong> or logging onto <strong>Allstate.com</strong>.</p>

Be Prepared, Not Overwhelmed During Hurricane Irene
Steps You Can Take Now To Be Ready Should the Storm Strike<br /><strong>This release contains: 1 Related Document</strong><p>Taking steps to get ready in advance of storms can help homeowners minimize property damage and protect their family. Allstate (NYSE: ALL) encourages everyone to develop a plan well before a hurricane threatens their community by understanding their insurance coverage and developing an evacuation strategy for your family and your pets.</p>
<p><strong>Allstate suggests homeowners consider the following tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct a home inventory of your possessions. It's helpful to keep track of model numbers and stores where items were purchased. Store your inventory, including photos and videos, in a safe place away from your home.</li>
<li>Develop an evacuation plan that includes identification of safe areas, escape routes, meeting locations and plans for pets.</li>
<li>Prepare an Emergency Supply Kit including a three-day supply of water, non-perishable food, radio and batteries, flashlight and first-aid kit.</li>
<li>Remove any diseased and damaged limbs from trees to keep them from blowing around during a storm and causing property or automobile damage.</li>
<li>Purchase materials such as plywood that can be used to reinforce your windows, doors and garage doors. Install anchors and pre-drill holes for the plywood so you can install them quickly in the event of a storm.</li>
<li>Install head and foot bolts in doors for extra protection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minimize your losses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review your home insurance policy and coverage limits with an agent. Know what you are and are not covered for in the event of a hurricane.</li>
<li>Ask your insurance agent about flood insurance. This coverage is only offered through the federal government's National Flood Insurance Program, but policies are sold and managed by private insurance companies like Allstate. Keep in mind that coverage does not take effect until 30 days after purchase.</li>
<li>Find out if you have comprehensive auto coverage for damage to your car caused by falling objects or flood.</li>
<li>Gather important documents such as insurance policies, birth certificates and identification. Make sure to place them in a waterproof container.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There's an App for That</strong>. Allstate's latest iPhone application, "Digital Locker," can help you create a home inventory. Free and available to any iPhone user, the home inventory tool makes it easy to catalog belongings and keep that vital information in one handy location &ndash; right in your pocket.</p>

The Allstate Foundation Honors Christina-Taylor Green with a Little Hands Playground at Mesa Verde Elementary School
Classmates and Community Involved in the Design and Build<br /><strong>This release contains: 2 Photos, 1 Related Document</strong><p>An inspiration to her community, Christina-Taylor Green received a fitting tribute today as The Allstate Foundation announces plans to replace the 35-year-old play equipment at Christina's school, Mesa Verde Elementary, in Tucson, Arizona.</p>
<p>Green's teachers and community will come together to build the new Christina-Taylor Green Little Hands Playground on September 17; the playground will be dedicated a week later, in a ceremony on September 24.</p>
<p>"Christina always looked after her classmates and the people she loved," said Roxanna Green, Christina's mother. "The playground will provide a fun and safe place for Mesa Verde students and residents to play for years to come &ndash; something Christina would have loved for our community."</p>
<p>The Christina-Taylor Green Little Hands Playground is the result of a $140,000 donation from The Allstate Foundation to The Injury Free Coalition for Kids at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. The Allstate Foundation has built more than 40 playgrounds nationwide with Injury Free; this will be the first in Arizona.</p>
<p>"Allstate wanted to honor Christina's memory and to help the Tucson community renew in the wake of the sad event that took Christina's life," said Denis Bailey, field senior vice president for Allstate Insurance Company in Arizona. "This will be a safe, happy place in a city where our customers, employees and friends live, work and play, so this project means a great deal to all of us."</p>
<p>Mesa Verde Principal Foster Hepler said the school prides itself on the health and wellness of its students and a new playground was the school's long-time wish. "It's an opportunity for our school to honor the memory of our dear friend, Christina, while providing an outlet for our students to become physically and mentally fit," he said.</p>
<p>In addition to The Allstate Foundation, a number of community and corporate organizations contributed to the project. This includes an in-kind donation of concrete construction and labor valued at $13,000 by the Sundt Foundation. Also, Mesa Verde Student Council utilized donations by neighboring schools, organizations and individuals in the memory of Christina-Taylor Green to aid in the project. Other funds were provided by The John Jay and Rich Care for Kids Foundation and Little Tikes Corporation.</p>
<p>In May, dozens of Christina-Taylor Green's classmates gathered with their physical education teacher, Ann Wheaton, around renderings of slides, monkey bars, climbing walls and ladders as they chose their favorite ways to play. The Allstate Foundation, Injury Free Coalition and Little Tikes representatives listened as the children shared their thoughts on artwork and equipment to replace the current play area, consisting of original metal structures dating back to 1978 -- the year the school was built. The playground colors were chosen by Christina's classmates to reflect the school colors &ndash; red, blue and white. They also chose a butterfly image as the playground focal point, since Christina loved butterflies and frequently drew them in her artwork.</p>
<p>Injury Fee and Little Tikes then rendered thoughts from that session into a design that features accessible, safe equipment, spans nearly 2,000-square-feet, and features a transfer station with safety rails for wheelchair accessibility; a rock challenge wall; three slides; five climbing areas; several spinning functions; and a soft-landing safety surface.</p>
<p>"When I started The Injury Free Coalition, I realized too many children were injured because they did not have a safe place to play," said Dr. Barbara Barlow, MD, Executive Director of the Injury Free Coalition for Kids at the Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University. "For the past 23 years, we have successfully reduced injury through education, construction of safe play areas and the development and support of safe supervised activities."</p>
<p>Since 2001, the Injury Free Coalition and The Allstate Foundation have a history of promoting safe and vital communities that emphasize tolerance, inclusion, diversity and economic empowerment through the Little Hands Playground projects. The Coalition is helping to reduce injuries, the number one cause of death and hospitalization for young people. In addition to preventing unintentional injuries to children, community interventions involving the creation of "Safe Play Spaces" such as the Little Hands Playground projects revitalize distressed neighborhoods and reestablishes community spirit and pride by empowering a broad based coalition of residents with the skills and relationships necessary to improve the quality of their lives.</p>
<p><strong>About The Allstate Foundation</strong><br /> Established in 1952, The Allstate Foundation is an independent, charitable organization made possible by subsidiaries of The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL). Through partnerships with nonprofit organizations across the country, The Allstate Foundation brings the relationships, reputation and resources of Allstate to support innovative and lasting solutions that enhance people's well-being and prosperity. With a focus on teen safe driving and building financial independence for domestic violence survivors, The Allstate Foundation also promotes safe and vital communities; tolerance, inclusion, and diversity; and economic empowerment.

Be Prepared, Not Overwhelmed
Steps You Can Take During the Calm Before the Storm<br /><strong>This release contains: 1 Related Document</strong><p>With Hurricane Irene having the potential to reach the coastal areas of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, it&rsquo;s time to execute your preparedness plan. Allstate has years of experience helping customers and their families protect themselves every step of the way. We believe preparing in advance of a storm gives homeowners the best chance to minimize risk and start on the road to recovery.</p>
<p>Understanding your insurance coverage and preparing for the dangers of a hurricane can help to minimize property damage and protect your family. Allstate suggests considering the following steps to help you and your family prepare for a hurricane:</p>
<p><strong>How to help protect yourself and your family in advance of a storm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct a home inventory recording each of your possessions. It&rsquo;s also helpful to keep track of model numbers and stores where items were purchased. Store your inventory, including photos and videos, in a safe place away from your home.</li>
<li>Develop an evacuation plan that includes identification of safe areas, escape routes, meeting locations and plans for pets.</li>
<li>Prepare an Emergency Supply Kit including a three-day supply of water, non-perishable food, radio and batteries, flashlight and first-aid kit.</li>
<li>Remove any diseased and damaged limbs from trees to keep them from blowing around during a storm and causing a wind hazard or property damage.</li>
<li>Purchase materials such as 3/4&rdquo; plywood that can be used to reinforce your windows, doors and garage doors. Install anchors and pre-drill holes for the plywood so you can install them quickly in the event of a storm.</li>
<li>Install head and foot bolts in doors for extra protection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minimize your losses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review your home insurance policy and coverage limits with an agent. Know what you are and are not covered for in the event of a hurricane.</li>
<li>Find out if you have comprehensive car coverage. This will usually reimburse you for damage to your car caused by falling objects or flood.</li>
<li>Gather important documents such as insurance policies, birth certificates and identification. Make sure to place them in a waterproof container.</li>

Home Inventory Can Help Homeowners Prepare For Hurricanes
<strong>This release contains: 1 Related Document</strong><p>The damage caused by hurricanes like the approaching Irene can be devastating, leaving people without homes or dealing with major repairs. While we can't predict whether or not our homes our home will be affected by hurricanes, tornados, hail, heavy winds or strong thunderstorms, home owners and renters can make sure their property and belongings are properly protected.</p>
<p>With Hurricane Irene approaching the coastal areas of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, now is the time for coastal residents to protect themselves and their property.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you own your house, condo or townhome, or if you rent, this next question should be very important to you: <strong>If disaster struck your home would you know what you owned?</strong> <strong><em>Remember that even though it can take years to collect your possessions, they could be gone in a split second following a disaster like a fire, flood, tornado, hurricane, storm or another peril.</em></strong></p>
<p>If your home, condo or apartment is damaged or destroyed in a storm, an accurate and up-to-date home inventory can help make the possible recovery process easier on you and your family.</p>
<h4>7 Steps to a Home Inventory&hellip;</h4>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Allstate recommends, whenever possible, make      sure your home inventory list includes photographs or video of your      belongings. If you have a home video camera, take periodic videos of each      room in your house. Focus on individual items in each room. Take      additional video of smaller items like jewelry, silver, and related      valuables or keepsakes.<strong> </strong>The same recommendations apply if you're      using a conventional camera. Be sure to be thorough when taking pictures      of your belongings.</li>
<li>Include with any picture or video home      inventory list, a detailed, written account of what you own.<strong> </strong>Be      specific in your written inventory<strong>. </strong>Whenever possible include make,      model, serial numbers, receipts, and date of purchase for all items in      your home inventory.</li>
<li>If you don't have pictures, a written home      inventory list is better than no inventory, but make sure you are as      detailed as possible.</li>
<li>Store your home inventory list somewhere away      from your home.<strong> </strong>If you have a bank safety deposit box, keep your      list there. If you don't have a safety deposit box, ask a friend or      relative to keep your inventory list in a safe place.<strong> </strong>Allstate recommends, wherever      you store your home inventory list, make sure the location is far enough      away from your home it won't be lost in the same event that may destroy      your house.<strong> </strong>However, make sure your home inventory list is kept      close enough so that it is easily accessible to you when you need it.</li>
<li>Be sure to update your home inventory after      any major purchase or gift.<strong> </strong>You should be updating your home      inventory periodically anyway, but make special effort to do so after any      major purchase, holidays, or birthdays.</li>
<li>If time permits, share your home inventory      with your Allstate agent so that he or she can help you decide if your      coverage meets your needs.</li>
<li>Allstate's iPhone application, "Digital      Locker," can help. Free and available to any iPhone user, not just      Allstate customers, the home inventory tool makes it easy to catalog      belongings and keep that vital information in one handy location - right      in your pocket.<strong></strong></li>

Allstate Offers Final Preparation Tips for Coastal Residents
Hurricane Irene Could Mean Evacuations, Severe Damage<br /><strong>This release contains: 1 Related Document</strong><p>With Hurricane Irene having the potential to reach coastal Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, it is important to obey instructions from local authorities and take preparation steps. Allstate (NYSE: ALL) recommends homeowners follow these easy tips now that can make the hurricane rebuilding process easier on you and your family.</p>
<p><strong>Before you leave&hellip;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collect all your important papers and documents. This includes bank and financial information, as well as your bills and checkbooks.</li>
<li>Some coastal homeowners may have their insurance for wind and flood with a different insurance company than their primary homeowners insurance policy. Make sure to gather information about your homeowner, flood, wind and auto insurance carriers and policy numbers.</li>
<li>Think carefully about what items are easily replaceable by insurance and what items are not, like family heirlooms, keepsakes and pictures.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have an up-to-date home inventory, walk through your home with a video or still camera. At the same time, make a list of what items you want to take during an evacuation. An inventory can help facilitate the claim process.</li>
<li>Review your homeowners insurance policy to determine whether it provides for additional living expenses when you are prohibited from using your home because of civil authority orders. Contact your agent or insurance company with any questions.<strong></strong></li>
<li>Review your auto policy to determine whether you have coverage for flying objects or rising water. Contact your agent or insurance company with any questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you leave&hellip;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Respect local authorities and law enforcement decisions on when to evacuate and when it is safe to return home. </li>
<li>Tell your neighbors where you will be going and exchange contact information.</li>

      Allstate Offers Final Preparation Tips for Coastal Residents
Hurricane Irene Could Mean Evacuations, Severe Damage<br /><strong>This release contains: 1 Related Document</strong><p>With Hurricane Irene having the potential to reach coastal Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, it is important to obey instructions from local authorities and take preparation steps. Allstate (NYSE: ALL) recommends homeowners follow these easy tips now that can make the hurricane rebuilding process easier on you and your family.</p>
<p><strong>Before you leave&hellip;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collect all your important papers and documents. This includes bank and financial information, as well as your bills and checkbooks.</li>
<li>Some coastal homeowners may have their insurance for wind and flood with a different insurance company than their primary homeowners insurance policy. Make sure to gather information about your homeowner, flood, wind and auto insurance carriers and policy numbers.</li>
<li>Think carefully about what items are easily replaceable by insurance and what items are not, like family heirlooms, keepsakes and pictures.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have an up-to-date home inventory, walk through your home with a video or still camera. At the same time, make a list of what items you want to take during an evacuation. An inventory can help facilitate the claim process.</li>
<li>Review your homeowners insurance policy to determine whether it provides for additional living expenses when you are prohibited from using your home because of civil authority orders. Contact your agent or insurance company with any questions.<strong></strong></li>
<li>Review your auto policy to determine whether you have coverage for flying objects or rising water. Contact your agent or insurance company with any questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you leave&hellip;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Respect local authorities and law enforcement decisions on when to evacuate and when it is safe to return home. </li>
<li>Tell your neighbors where you will be going and exchange contact information.</li>

<li>After exhausting all sources of grant aid, the typical low-income student must come up with more than $11,000 a year to attend a public or private nonprofit college. (<em>Education Trust analysis of NPSA, 2008​</em>)</li>
<li>The disparity between upper and lower-income students is profound: more than 90 percent of high school students from families making more than $100,000 enroll in college, compared to 78 percent of students from families making $50,001 to $100,000, and 52 percent of students from families making $20,000 and less.

Americans Say 'Yes' to New Requirements for Teen Drivers
Allstate poll shows support for national GDL law; doubt about teen driving skills<br /><strong>This release contains: 1 Related Document</strong><p>A recent national survey from Allstate Insurance reveals that nearly six in 10 Americans favor a federal law that establishes minimum requirements for state graduated driver licensing (GDL). Survey results show that support for a national law corresponds with low opinions about teen driving skills, which received the lowest ranking among all ages surveyed.</p>
<p>Currently, the Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection (STANDUP) Act is pending in Congress as part of the Motor Vehicle and Highway Safety Improvement Act of 2011 (MVHSIA) or Mariah's Law, named after an Arkansas teen killed in a crash involving texting. STANDUP calls for uniform standards that restrict nighttime driving, limits the number of passengers in a teen's car, prohibits the use of cell phones while driving, and issues permits and licenses with specific age requirements and through a gradual, multi-phased process.</p>
<p>When asked about the specific provisions included in the STANDUP Act, Americans are solidly in favor of the policies. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seventy-six percent back a minimum age of 16 to receive a learner's permit, and 69 percent favor requiring three stages of licensing. </li>
<li>Seven in 10 Americans favor restricting unsupervised nighttime driving for those under age 18, and 65 percent support restricting the number of non-family passengers for drivers under 18.</li>
<li>When asked about the prohibition of cell phones or texting while driving for younger drivers, 81 percent are in favor. </li>
<li>Support for STANDUP and its individual provisions crosses all age groups, geographic regions, and political affiliation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The survey also shows that American drivers are highly critical of teenage drivers, giving them the lowest rating of all age groups. Eighty-one percent rate teenagers as "average" or "poor" drivers.</p>
<p>"Results from this survey show that Americans clearly understand that GDL laws can help save lives, and that a majority of them support a legislative solution that safely introduces teen drivers to the road," said Bill Vainisi, senior vice president and deputy general counsel, Allstate. "What's needed now is national leadership in the form of uniform standards for those GDL laws."</p>
<p><strong>About the Survey</strong></p>
<p>The survey of 1,000 American adults was conducted July 13, 14, 16 and 17 via landline and cell phone and has a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percent. Of the 1,000 adults, the survey identified 848 drivers who hold a license and drive at least occasionally. The survey was conducted by Financial Dynamics (FD) for Allstate.</p>

Allstate Wants to Keep The "Boom" On The Right Side Of Your Boat
Tips to avoid boating's most common accidents <br /><strong>This release contains: 2 Videos, 1 Related Document</strong><p>As the 2011 boating season winds down, good news from the Coast Guard is both cause for celebration and a reminder to remain vigilant. According to a recent report, recreational boating fatalities fell to 672 in 2010 - a record low &ndash; and reported accidents fell from 4730 in 2009 to 4604 in 2010 as well.</p>
<p>Allstate Insurance internal data shows the leading causes of boating accidents are hitting submerged objects (e.g. a rock or log) and running the boat aground. These types of incidents accounted for two-thirds of Allstate boating accident claims in 2010.</p>
<p>Allstate recently released video vignettes to help boaters learn the best ways to remain safe out on the water. These short videos are available at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/allstatenews">www.youtube.com/allstatenews</a> . Additionally, the following simple tips will help boaters steer clear of accidents by keeping the "boom" on the side of their boat and not under it:</p>
<ul type="disc">

      Allstate Wants to Keep The "Boom" On The Right Side Of Your Boat
Tips to avoid boating's most common accidents <br /><strong>This release contains: 2 Videos, 1 Related Document</strong><p>As the 2011 boating season winds down, good news from the Coast Guard is both cause for celebration and a reminder to remain vigilant. According to a recent report, recreational boating fatalities fell to 672 in 2010 - a record low &ndash; and reported accidents fell from 4730 in 2009 to 4604 in 2010 as well.</p>
<p>Allstate Insurance internal data shows the leading causes of boating accidents are hitting submerged objects (e.g. a rock or log) and running the boat aground. These types of incidents accounted for two-thirds of Allstate boating accident claims in 2010.</p>
<p>Allstate recently released video vignettes to help boaters learn the best ways to remain safe out on the water. These short videos are available at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/allstatenews">www.youtube.com/allstatenews</a> . Additionally, the following simple tips will help boaters steer clear of accidents by keeping the "boom" on the side of their boat and not under it:</p>

<li>A depth-finder and      charts of the underwater landscape can help prevent running aground.</li>

New Allstate Survey Shows Americans Think They Are Great Drivers - Habits Tell a Different Story
Survey shows drivers quick to tout skills, slow to practice responsible driving<br /><strong>This release contains: 1 Video, 1 Related Document</strong><p>The majority of Americans consider themselves to be good drivers but a new study reveals their candor tells a different - and dangerous - story.</p>
<p>American drivers believe their own driving knowledge, ability and safe driving habits are well above other drivers on the road. Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of American drivers rate themselves as "excellent" or "very good" drivers. American drivers' positive self-rating is more than twice as high as the rating they give to their own close friends (29 percent&nbsp; "excellent" or "very good") and also other people their age (22 percent).</p>
<p>Drivers also don't think much of the driving ability of people from surrounding states. Fifty-three percent rate them as "average" or "poor," while just 8 percent rate those drivers as "excellent" or "very good."</p>
<p>Others who American drivers rated lower than themselves include:</p>
<ul>
<li>American drivers give teenage drivers the lowest rating of all groups. Eighty-one percent rate teenagers as "average" or "poor" drivers. </li>
<li>Seven in 10 Americans give senior citizen drivers comparatively low scores.</li>
<li>Parents with very young children in the car also get mediocre scores from the American driving public. Just 26 percent of American drivers rate this group as "excellent" or "good," while 33 percent rate them as "average" or "poor."</li>
<li>Even those American drivers who have their own very young children are critical of their peers and rate themselves more than twice as high as "excellent" or "good" drivers (64 percent) than they rate their fellow parents (29 percent).</li>
</ul>
<p>Among all drivers surveyed, men are more likely to rate themselves as "excellent" than women (36 percent versus 26 percent), as are college-educated drivers (35 percent) compared to those with no degree (28 percent). Republicans also rate themselves higher (70 percent) than Democrats (61 percent) or Independents (61 percent).</p>
<p><strong>"I know it's wrong, but..."</strong><br /> Despite American drivers' confidence in their abilities, many admit to practicing dangerous behaviors on the road.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eighty-nine percent say they've driven faster than the posted speed limit, and 40 percent say they've driven more than 20 miles per hour over the limit.</li>
<li>Men are more likely to speed than women (48 percent versus 30 percent).&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>Americans' bad driving habits don't stop at speeding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost half (45 percent) say they have driven while excessively tired - to the point of almost falling asleep. </li>
<li>Fifteen percent say they have driven while intoxicated, with men almost four times more likely than women to have done so (23 percent of men versus six percent of women).</li>
<li>More than one-third (34 percent) have sent a text-message or email while driving, but the prevalence of the practice changes by age group. Those 18-29 years of age are the most likely to text while driving (63 percent) with drivers ages 30-44 not far behind (58 percent). Texting while driving decreases with older age groups; only 25 percent of those 45-54, six percent of those 55-64, and two percent of those over 65 admit to the practice. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>"I'm a great driver, except for my record."<br /> </strong>Most American drivers have caused some dangerous situations for others while driving.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seven in 10 American drivers say that as a result of being distracted while driving, they have slammed their brakes or swerved to avoid an accident, missed a traffic signal, or actually caused an accident. </li>
<li>Fifty-three percent report having received a speeding ticket or other moving violation. Among these drivers, 44 percent say they have received three or more. More men say they have received a ticket than women (61 percent vs. 46 percent), and those who have received tickets get more of them (an average of 4.3 per man compared to 2.6 per woman). </li>
<li>Fifty-six percent of American drivers say they have been involved in an accident, but only 28 percent of them say the accident was their own fault. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mother Nature and rush hour cause storm of nerves<br /> </strong>Regardless of confidence or high self-ratings, a significant number of American drivers experience concern about certain driving situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-thirds (64 percent) of American drivers say that driving in the snow, heavy rain or other bad weather is stressful and uncomfortable. Fifty-six percent report the same about driving in heavy traffic, and 41 percent say that driving behind or near large trucks is stressful and uncomfortable.</li>
<li>Driving at night (29 percent stressful and uncomfortable), driving over a long bridge (17 percent), driving through a tunnel (13 percent), and driving on the highway (16 percent) rate lower on the stress scale. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the Survey</strong><br /> The survey of 1,000 American adults was conducted July 13, 14, 16 and 17 via landline and cell phone and has a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percent. Of the 1,000 adults, the survey identified 848 drivers who hold a license and drive at least occasionally. The survey was conducted by Financial Dynamics (FD) for Allstate.</p>

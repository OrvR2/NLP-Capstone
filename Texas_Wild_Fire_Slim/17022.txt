Criticism was unfounded
Being in the newspaper business, we come across people of all kinds. Because we meet and speak with so many different types of people, we also deal with all sorts of emotions.

Taking Fat Tuesday literally
This week, we saw the end of Mardi Gras and the beginning of Lent. While I know Fat Tuesday is not as widely celebrated here as in New Orleans, I took the holiday quite literally. Now, I don’t normally eat very much on a daily basis, but on Tuesday, I really racked up the calories. [...]

Tonight’s roast promises fun
We’re looking forward to seeing a big turnout tonight for the Greater Ennis United Way’s annual roast. Since it began, this event has proven to be one of the highlights of the local social calendar.

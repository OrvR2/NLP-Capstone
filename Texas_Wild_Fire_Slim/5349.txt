Rights group: Forced labor in Vietnam drug centersBy MIKE IVES - Associated Press | AP – 17 hrs ago





HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — An international human rights group urged Vietnam to shut down drug rehabilitation centers that it said subject inmates to abuse and forced labor. It also called Wednesday on international donors to check the programs they fund inside the centers for possible ties to human rights violations.New York-based Human Rights Watch accused Vietnam of imprisoning hundreds of thousands of drug addicts over the past decade without due process and forcing them to work long hours for little pay.It also alleged that the U.S. and Australian governments, the United Nations, the World Bank and other international donors may "indirectly facilitate human rights abuses" by providing drug dependency or HIV treatment and prevention services to addicts inside some of the centers.About 309,000 drug users nationwide passed through the centers from 2000 to 2010, with the number of facilities more than doubling — from 56 to 123— and the maximum length of detention rising from one to four years, the report said, citing government figures.The report called drug treatment at the centers "ineffective and abusive," claiming donor support for health services inside such facilities allows Vietnam to "maximize profits" by detaining drug addicts for longer periods and forcing them to do manual labor."People who are dependent on drugs in Vietnam need access to community-based, voluntary treatment," Joe Amon, health and human rights director at Human Rights Watch in New York, said in a statement. "Instead, the government is locking them up, private companies are exploiting their labor and international donors are turning a blind eye to the torture and abuses they face."Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga called the report "groundless," saying compulsory drug rehabilitation in Vietnam is "humane, effective and beneficial for drug users, community and society."Vietnam's drug rehabilitation centers comply with Vietnamese law and are "in line" with drug-treatment principles set by the U.S., the U.N. and the World Health Organization, Nga added.Officials from the U.S., Australia and the United Nations declined to comment.The U.S. last year provided $7.7 million to the country for methadone treatment and community-based drug intervention, according to the US Embassy website. Injecting drug users are a driving force behind HIV infections across Vietnam.The World Bank funded an HIV/AIDS prevention program in 20 drug rehabilitation centers across Vietnam that ended last year."We have not received any reports of human rights violations in the drug rehabilitation clinics supported by the project," said Victoria Kwakwa, World Bank Vietnam's country director. "If we had, we would have conducted a supervision mission to ensure bank policies were met and concerns fully examined."Detainees inside the Vietnamese drug centers report beatings and spells of solitary confinement, and some who attempted escape say they were captured and shocked with an electric baton as punishment, according to the 126-page report that interviewed 34 former detainees in 2010 who were held at 14 centers in and around southern Ho Chi Minh City.It also charged Vietnam with forcing prisoners to sew clothing, lay bricks or husk cashews for between $5 and $20 per month, a violation of domestic labor law, which guarantees a minimum monthly wage of about $40.Instead of providing health services inside the centers, donors should focus on releasing detainees back into their communities, the report said, citing government reports that place the relapse rate for drug users treated inside the centers at 80 percent or higher.China and other Southeast Asian countries have also come under fire from rights groups in recent years for alleged human rights violations inside similar drug rehabilitation facilities.Several large escapes from Vietnam's drug rehabilitation centers have been reported in recent years.The centers, which began opening after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, are one facet of Vietnam's ongoing campaign against drug abuse, prostitution and other so-called "social evils."Most detainees are young male heroin users, the Human Rights Watch report said, citing government data. Some are rounded up by police while others are sent to the centers by family members.Vietnam says there are 138,000 drug addicts in the country and 30 percent them are HIV positive, down from 60 percent in 2006.

At least it will make the people of Vietnam think twice about using illegal drugs.  Countries need to get tough on drug users and drug dealers to stamp out that stuff.

China at one time solved its drug problem took out the users and dealers and shot them....success rate for Heroin and Meth rehab is minscule compared to the number so users......some one even wrote a comment about the only one being hurt is the user...The Columbian, central American, Mexican and American drug gangs and cartels murder using the funds coming from the users....Robberies and muggings by the users is what just imaginary.....these harmless addicts .....They provide billions of dollars to the cartels and gangs so they can continue to murder and undermine our society and every murder done by the gangs and cartels is the direct responsiblity of the user....The addicts brought this on themselves so let the Vietnamese handle them the way they want and call it TOUGH LOVE

Their is 7.7 million we should keep here in the United States to help our own people. We are in dept because we help to many countries with their problems. But all they do is talk about how we should live in our means. U.S.A stop sending our money out of the country for others.

Except for the part about "due process" it sounds pretty much like what we do to addicts in this country.

Drug rehab centers are at high risk for becoming unregulated prison/prison labor centers in these 2nd and 3rd world countries because people associate the term "drug rehab" with all things good. This is how many of these defacto prisons escape scuitiny by international human rights regulators and often receive funding from organizations who normally do much good. The U.S. had a series of drug rehab chains in the 1970, 1980's and 1990's that basically became fronts for soaking up money from insurance companies and rich parents who wanted to dump their kids off. After numerous deaths, injuries and sexual assaults/rapes within the facilities they were shut down because of numerous lawsuits and criminal charges against staff members. Many of the kids in the programs were locked up for periods ranging from 1-5 years and often not allowed to leave the group sessions or attend school/see their families. The rehabs were unregulated by the state/federal government and staff/directors were free to punish/isolate the kids as they saw fit. The kids were constantly harrassed into making up false claims of drug usage and crimes to escape abuse from the brutal untrained/uncertified staff. Many who were recruited from within the programs. Many kids in the program mutilated/carved repeatedly into their arms with their fingernails after several years in the program (leaving permanent arm scars) and many committed suicide after leaving the programs. FRONTS FOR INSURANCE MONEY/PRISON LABOR.

Vietnam is a net drug producer.  By targeting harsh enforcement at addicts, they can drive down the local demand for drugs and make the local wholesale price cheaper.  America is a net drug consumer; by "trading up" to the "biggest fish" we ensure that drugs are always in short supply and prices are astronomical.  Both regimes have the same purpose - to make drug smuggling as profitable as possible for those with the right connections.

No wonder, these communist thugs get funds from WB, therefore, they try to arrest as many as they can and abuse them. They just simply do not care at all. Please,, cut this funding and then no more complain.

This is what happen when people have no say in what their government does, you end up building your own prison. So go and vote people, make sure you show your government who hold the power! People in the US and our government should never give another country money unless we know for certain it goes to the people the needs it. For sure without the money we give Vietnam yearly there would be less slave rehabilitation centers. Communist won't do anything for their own people unless it benefit the officials.

As opposed to the American drug rehabilitation system, where we give them welfare and coddle them, and 90% go back to heroin use.

All drug treatment is a scam, its a massive industry that should not even exist. The most harmful things a drug addict faces is directly due the prohibition of the drug and not from the drug itself. Take heroin, heroin doesn't cause liver damage like alcohol, it doesn't cause brain damage like alcohol, it doesn't cause cancer like tobacco, nobody died from heroin withdrawal unlike alcohol in which there is a moderate risk of death if they are heavy drinkers and go cold turkey without medical supervision. If heroin were legal the average user would probably spend about 30 cents on a day on heroin and could lead a normal life but instead we force them into thousand dollar a day treatment facilities at the taxpayer's expense just because some mindless flag-waving sheeple are brainwashed into thinking it is morally wrong and want to project the morals that were imposed on them onto other people.

With donations in short supply, some sperm donors are unwittingly fathering dozens and dozens of children, a practice that's raising red flags with parents and critics. 'Today' correspondent George Lewis chronicles the outrage that has spawned new rules and regulations regarding sperm donation. "Sharon from Seattle had two children via artificial insemination from the same sperm donor," Lewis reports. Through an upcoming documentary on the Style network, Sharon learned that her children's donor, a Boston man named "Ben," has over 70 offspring. 

"But Ben doesn't hold the record, 'New York Times' reporter Jacqueline Mroz discovered one donor with at least 150 offspring," Lewis reports. According to University of Pennsylvania bioethicist Arthur Caplan, "there is no doubt, none, that that is unethical." New laws are being considered to prevent other donors like "Ben" from becoming "triple digit dads."

I loved this, so cool! Wilco in a nutshell. i feel some of this footage might as well have come﻿ from Pat Sansone. I heard he enjoys capturing this type and style of video. Very good job guys!

2:20 - 3:30 was awesome but it gave me a headache! Just pick a couple images to﻿ feature instead of like a million.

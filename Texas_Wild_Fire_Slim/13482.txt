A California Highway Patrol officer stands with two construction workers at a construction site where a scaffolding collapsed at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2011. Three people have been taken to hospitals after construction scaffolding collapsed on cars at the nation's busiest border crossing connecting San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico.

(09-14) 20:31 PDT San Diego -- 
Scaffolding collapsed on more than a dozen cars at the nation's busiest border crossing Wednesday, injuring 11 people and halting all traffic entering from Mexico, authorities said.
A construction worker at the San Ysidro crossing between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, was seriously hurt, said Maurice Luque, spokesman for the San Diego Fire-Rescue Department. The others were taken to hospitals with minor injuries, including a pregnant woman, he said.
A section of scaffold installed to protect cars from overhead construction collapsed onto eight of the border crossing's 24 northbound vehicle lanes shortly before 11 a.m., officials said. It left a mangled mess of wooden planks, metal supports and black tarpaulin atop 15 vehicles that had just passed through inspection booths.
"There were several vehicles completely covered in debris," said Frank Jaramillo, the director of San Diego's two border crossings for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Three people had to be extricated from cars, while the others walked away, Luque said.
The cause of the collapse was under investigation. An investigator from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration was at the scene.
All U.S.-bound vehicle and pedestrian lanes were closed, and travelers were directed to Otay Mesa about five miles east, CBP officials said. Mexico-bound lanes remained open. Pedestrian traffic resumed nearly eight hours after the scaffolding.
The General Services Administration, which owns the ports of entry, was assessing the integrity of the remaining scaffold before deciding when San Ysidro's vehicle lanes would reopen.
Waiting times to enter the U.S. at Otay Mesa on Wednesday afternoon reached about 2 1/2 hours for motorists and two hours for pedestrians, about twice the normal delay, Jaramillo said.
Officials were taking several measures to alleviate traffic. Six cargo lanes at Otay Mesa were to open to passenger vehicles until 5 a.m. Thursday, and the Tecate port of entry, about 40 miles east, was to remain open overnight instead of closing at 11 p.m., Jaramillo said.
About 50,000 vehicles and 25,000 pedestrians enter the United States each day at the San Ysidro crossing. Heightened border security after 9/11 has resulted in waits that can last hours during morning rush hour and other peak travel times.
The 30-year-old border crossing facility is undergoing a $577 million overhaul by Hensel Phelps Construction Co., based in Greeley, Colo.
Randy Barr, operations manager for the company, said that at the time the scaffolding collapsed, workers were removing plaster from the port of entry's administration building that will be demolished.

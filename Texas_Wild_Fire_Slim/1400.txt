				This is like the 6th time they have posted this story, complete with outrage...­...

Why - the person who paid for the house - keeps it when the divorce is final.  Imagine that.  A man buys a house, and gets to keep it!  Outrageous­!!!

Meanwhile, the token posts that tell of men's issues in family law, are quickly buried after one day. :)

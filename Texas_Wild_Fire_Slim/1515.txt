Moved to action by a recent trip to famine-torn Africa, 50 cent has launched an energy drink whose profits will feed 1 billion kids in the region.
The rapper has teamed up with Pure Growth Partners to bring Street King, a new energy drink, to the market, PopCrush.com reports.  Proceeds from every sale will go toward feeding 1 billion kids in Africa.  
"I grew up without money, but I didn't grow up hungry," 50 Cent said in a video introducing the product. "It's our responsibility to come together and do things to create a solution."
Street King hit stores this week, in orange mango and grape flavors, and the rapper is encouraging fans to register at the energy drink's website.
"I need you to utilize your energy--your voice--to provide additional motivation for me at times," 50 Cent said.

Ambassador Tony Hall: Fasting, Budget Cuts and National Humiliation


		                        
																Budgets are moral documents by nature. They reflect the priorities of individuals, households and even nations, exposing our real notions of who and what is valuable.                             







Jayshree Bajoria: Al-Shabaab and Somalia's Famine


		                        
																We need to learn from this crisis that there are many factors that contributed to it. One is conflict. And conflict resolution should be essential.                             







Glen Pearson: African Famine: "I See You"


		                        
																One of Bev Oda's enduring memories was the leathery and cracked feet of the children who had walked for kilometres and the stunned look on the faces as their bodies struggled to survive.                            







Edward Jackson: K'naan, Iman and the Famine in Somalia:  The Long Game Matters, Too


		                        
																The celebrities' call to action on the famine in Somalia is welcome, but the bottom line is that these countries need sustained economic growth. Such strategies are not without risks, however. Businesses must not be permitted to abuse human rights. Foreign investment must not undermine sovereignty.

				He's a class act & I hope others follow his lead..I dont want to sound greedy or racey but I really wish he started feeding people in the United States before venturing over to Africa. I just dont understand why we spend billions & billions of dollars helping everyone all over the globe while we neglect the poor, homeless, veterans, disabled & elderly that truely need our help here. I wish I had an answer..

				I wish him as much success as possible in his venture.
The man is putting his time and money where his mouth is, good for him.
Hopefully others will follow his example, 
there are those on both sides of the asile,
who have the means at their disposal to start other worthwhile programs.

Way to go man, I hope your blessings are multiplied­.

				I can't believe people complain about helping those in other countries. I really don't see how a geographic­al border should dictate who gets help and who doesn't. If there were starving kids in Pennsylvan­ia, should West Virginians complain if one of "their own" helped a Pennsylvan­ian child? Does that not seem stupid? We're all human beings, period!

				Well, when you think about it, the production and distributi­on of a new product always creates new jobs. So he is doing just that even if it isn't that many he is creating some as long as people buy the drink.  And maybe people will even buy the drink in Europe.  One could hope for global distributi­on.

A firefighter’s wife put this together as a dedication to her husband and other firefighters who responded to the October blazes.  Her husband was part of a strike team from the Bay Area 300 miles north.  She put together a collection of the more spectacular photos of the incidents.
She even snuck in the L.A. Times image of the firefighters huddled on a hilltop draped in their survival tents (shake and bake).  Gutsy move, they hate their images used without license.  Let’s see if they get worked up and make YouTube take it down.  I hope not. Check out the little rocker’s work of art!

Cal Fire Crew In Harris Fire Burn-Over; Story
2 comments






SignonSanDiego has shed light on the story of the four Cal Fire firefighters and the two civilians they tried to save near Protrero during the initial attack phase of the Harris Fire last Sunday.
Veteran Cal Fire Captain Ray Rapue and his crew of three responded to the Harris Fire from their station in San Marcos an hour north of the fire. Firefighter Andrew Pikop and Captain Rapue are recovering from burns while their two (unidentified) crew mates remain in critical condition. Read the full story here.
From the article;” Information about the firefight has been scarce. Cal Fire has a team of 15 investigating the incident, and everyone involved has been ordered not to discuss the details. But a picture of what happened is beginning to emerge. 
Unit Chief Henri Brachais, the lead investigator, said the firefighters were trying to save Thomas and Richard Varshock, whose home is off state Route 94 and Emery Lane in a remote part of San Diego County near the U.S.-Mexico border. 
 Thomas Varshock died. His 15-year-old son, whose hospital bed is down the hall from Pikop’s, has burns to more than 50 percent of his body. On Wednesday, he was covered with a white blanket. His face was bandaged and he was hooked to a ventilator. 
 Brachais said the fire crew was stopped at the Varshock home when “a burn-over occurred.” 
 “The fire went up the hill and flames went over the truck,” he said”…
“…Engine 3387 arrived in Potrero at about 11 a.m. It pulled up to the Varshock residence about an hour later. 
 What happened next isn’t entirely clear, but at some point all four firefighters and the Varshocks took cover in the firetruck.
By then, the fire was raging and Santa Ana winds were knocking down power lines. 
 “At first I wanted to help my crew get out, but once the fire blew up it disoriented me,” Pikop said. 
 Somehow he became separated from the firetruck. He heard his colleagues yelling his name, but he was running from flames and couldn’t find them. 
 “I ran through flames. I ran from flames. But the fire caught up to me,” he said. 
 He figured he was on his own. He assumed the rest of the crew was dead….”
A Forest Service helicopter crew came to their aid and that pilot and crew deserve recognition. I’m sure what they will find is Captain Rapue did everything possible to keep this from happening to his crew and the Varshocks.
If you pray offer one up today for the injured firefighters and also one for the young Varshock boy. He lost his dad and his home.

DC-10 Supertanker, Tanker 910 Over Slide Fire
Comments Off






Great video of Tanker 910 making a drop over the Slide Fire on October 22.
The converted DC-10 Supertanker is making a drop on the right flank of the fire near the head.  Unfortunately the 40 mph winds dispersed the retardant over a too wide area but the point has been made again that this weapon is worth its weight.
I’m betting the Forest Service people who killed the 747 Supertanker earlier this year feel kinda stupid right now.

We should have a minimum of 10 of these giants at the ready, year round.

Highlights from the Harris Fire Incident 209 filed at 0600 10/26;
 Size/AreaInvolved          84,300 ACRES
 % Containedor MMA20 Percent
Remarks:CDF Team 9 is in unified command with Forest Service, and San Miguel. 5 civilians have been killed and 21 injured by this fire. 4500 people are or have been threatened and evacuated. An estimated 200 homes have been destroyed or damaged. 1500 homes are or have been threatened. Detailed damage assessment is about 55% complete and those numbers are reported in section 24. Initial attack resources are being rested. Crew R&R stations have been established on the fire. Resource requests are critical. NORCAL Team 1, a Type 2 federal incident management team, is integrated with CAL FIRE Team 9.
Major problems and concerns (control problems, social/political/economic concerns or impacts, etc.) Relate critical resources needs identified above to the Incident Action Plan.Fire behavior remains active in old and extremely dry fuels. The heavy fuels and steep terrain on the northern edge of the fire present few control opportunities. Active structure protection continued in Lyons Valley. Many resource orders remain unfilled due to competing incidents in the southern part of the state. As the fire hit a decision point yesterday in Lyons Valley fire commanders implemented a contingency plan, which included an evacuation order of Lawson Valley, implementation of structure protection plans and a secondary dozer and holding line.
Given the current constraints,  when will the chosen management strategy succeed?Low confidence. Personnel are exhausted. Some additional resources are trickling in.Communities/Critical Infrastructure Threatened (in 12, 24, 48 and 72 hour time frames):12 hours: High-voltage power grid, Potrero, Barrett Junction, Barrett Lake area, Engineer Springs, Dulzura, Deerhorn Valley, Lawson Valley, Jamul, Lyons Valley.
Significant events today (closures, evacuations, significant progress made, etc.):Approximately 500 more homes were ordered evacuated yesterday. Yesterday re-entry for residents only was allowed in the Thousand Trails, Potrero and Tecate neighborhoods. Today re-entry for residents only will be allowed in the communities of western Jamul.——————

SoCal Wildfires: View From a Retired Fire Captain
Comments Off






(I was asked to submit an article on the Wildfires burning in Southern California by the good people at FireRescue.com. Read the full article here.)
Watching President Bush arrive on Air Force One to tour the fire damage in the San Diego region adds a punctuation mark to the tragic fire events of the past week. What we’re witnessing is an unprecedented fire event that is testing California in a number of ways.
It started with the Canyon Fire in Malibu, grabbing the attention of local and national media. Later that morning, the Buckweed Fire in Canyon Country above Los Angeles started followed quickly by news the Ranch Fire near Castaic could threaten the town of  Piru. 
With urgency, fire crews rushed to these potentially catastrophic Santa Ana wind-driven fires. Firefighters were rushing Code 3 to save lives and homes.
As the Los Angeles County fires became established, news of two fires in San Diego County crossed the wires. Ramona was being evacuated, Rancho Bernardo was put on alert. 
Later in the day ,the San Diego County Sheriff was quoted saying, “This will be worse than the Cedar Fire.”  The Cedar Fire destroyed more than 2,300 homes four years ago, burned 280,000 acres and killed 15 people including Steven Rucker, a firefighter from Novato.
The Harris Fire near Otay Mountain south of the Witch Fire in Ramona became a concern shortly after. This was indeed beginning to look like 2003, with fires burning in two regions of the Southland. An added element to this year’s version was the addition of two fires burning in the Lake Arrowhead area in San Bernadino County. 
Stretched resourcesNeedless to say, resources were, and are still, stretched. Due to high winds, fixed wing aircraft were grounded; the perfect storm was developing. This was forming to become “the big one,” that fire first responders discuss — the career fire, the big show. 
These established major fires were quickly joined by the Santiago, Rice, Rosa, Poomacha, Magic and Ammo fires. Each of these posed threats to life and homes. Eventually, more than 500,000 citizens were told to evacuate — an inconceivable number and seemingly an impossible task, a number larger than the Katrina evacuation. 
Against all the numbers, order prevailed. Evacuees found shelter, firefighters went to work and the government entities that support both came to the aid. 
Firefighters don’t shut down when there’s not enough help, they buck up and get to work. Not one fire had ideal resources. The Harris Fire in particular was extremely under manned. At its peak, the command team was working with only 255 fire personnel with no help in sight. In an ordinary circumstance, that fire alone would have more than 2,000 firefighters and support personnel. 
As the Harris Fire worked its way towards the San Diego suburb of Chula Vista, it had to pass through the San Miguel Fire District. San Miguel is a small town just east of Chula Vista. Whatever was coming their way was going to be up to them to confront — no help would be coming no matter how bad it would get. 


Fire Chief Augie Ghio was quoted the next day in a television interview, saying, “We’re OK, our guys can handle everything, no complaints.”  
When asked if he had slept, he said maybe a half an hour in the past three days. Underscore, no complaints. This man and his firefighters are about community and service. 
It’s this spirit that we see from the Governor’s office as well and  a similar spirit is apparent in the evacuation centers. As horrible as circumstances were and are, a positive attitude is present. 
As a life long Californian, I can only express pride in what I have witnessed. Trees will re grow, homes will be rebuilt. The state has been tested and from my view has passed with flying colors.

Harris Fire Running Hard In Jamul & Lyons Valley
Comments Off






While some fires are laying down elsewhere and backslapping goes on at Qualcom Park firefighters and some residents of Jamul and Lyons Valley are fending off flames as seen from the Lyons Peak web cam image below.The good news is there are fresh firefighters assigned to the incident as noted in the freshly filed Incident 209 report.Note that 200 homes have already been destroyed in this devastating fire.
The image is a south view from the Lyons Peak webcam.
Up to tonight the residents of of  Lyons Peak and Jamul have been holding off the advancing flames. Up to tonight the fire was moving in a predictable pattern as the offshore Santa Ana’s were blowing west. The changing winds, now coming from the west is pushing the fire both north and east!
Information from the Incident 209 filed 1900 hrs tonight offers the following;
Communities/Critical Infrastructure Threatened (in 12, 24, 48 and 72 hour time frames):12 hours: High-voltage power grid, Chula Vista, San Diego, San Miguel, Potrero, Barrett Junction, Barrett Lake area, Engineer Springs, Dulzura, Deerhorn Valley, Lawson Valley, Jamul, Lyons Valley and homes along Millar Ranch Road.
Significant events today (closures, evacuations, significant progress made, etc.):The fire was held at the edge of Chula Vista and San Miguel DPA. The returning onshore flow has moved the fire to the northeast threatening structures along Highway 94 from Jamul to the east, Lyons Valley to the north and Jamaica to the west. The regional communications equipment on Lyons Peak was damaged by fire, cutting off power and destroying the back-up generator. Crews installed a portable repeater to support fire communications. The fire progressed north in the Barrett Lake area, consuming old, heavy fuels.
 Major problems and concerns (control problems, social/political/economic concerns or impacts, etc.) Relate critical resources needs identified above to the Incident Action Plan.Extreme fire behavior due to fuel and weather conditions. East/northeast winds are active in the eastern portion of the fire. A more normal onshore flow is influencing the western portion. This wind confluence is causing erratic fire behavior. Major wind reversals in this area have caused firefighter fatalities during past incidents. Heavy fuels and steep terrain on the northern edge of the fire present few control opportunities. Crew fatigue is a serious problem. Some crews are being pulled off the line in spite of a lack of relief. Many resource orders remain unfilled due to competing incidents in the southern part of the state.
Projected incident movement/spread during next operational period (in 12, 24, 48, and 72 hour time frames):12 hours: Fire will continue to move to the north and east.
Remarks:CDF Team 9 is in unified command with Forest Service, San Diego City, Chula Vista and San Miguel. A total of 21 civilians have been injured and one killed by this fire. 4500 people are or have been threatened and evacuated. Additional evacuations are being ordered. An estimated 200 homes have been destroyed or damaged. 1500 homes are or have been threatened. Detailed damage assessment is about 55% complete and those numbers are reported in section 24. Many initial attack resources have been engaged continuously since the beginning of the fire. Resource requests are critical. An additional 271 people are assigned to the incident and are either enroute or were initial attack and have not been released from the line to check in. The total personnel count is 1611.
Size/AreaInvolved          75,000 ACRES, 10% Contained

Pray for the safety of fire personnel and the homeowners of this peaceful valley.

Editor & Publisher reports the Los Angeles Times is blogging the fires.
Check out their fire blog here.
Clean, great resources blog roll and the full weight of their reporting staff behind it.
They are following a trend of established (print) media understanding audience hunger for incident news in blog form. I’ve blogged on the trend before and believe now it will be the norm.
Cheers old media!

Slide Fire, Grass Valley Fire Updates
1 comment






The Grass Valley Fire is at 1,000 acres burned with an estimated 200 homes destroyed. The slide Fire has burned over 5,100 acres and has destroyed over 200 homes.
Exact counts are not available but the reported count is 200 homes on each fire. There is some confusion as the incident base camp is changing locations at the same time the new command team moves in.
Compounding overall efforts is the lack of personnel, damage assessment is pushed back.
These two fires ordinarily would require 2,000 + firefighters and support personnel each. The bark beetle kill in the forest is the added element that makes the fires more volatile. A lack of driving wind does not mean the fire is going to die on its own.All the brown trees you see from overhead are dead trees from the bark beetle kill.
Currently (as per official incident 209 reports filed 0600 today) there are 561 assigned to the Slide Fire and 548 fighting the Grass Valley Fire.
The good news from the Grass Valley Fire is found in the 209 report this morning;
Today’s observed fire behavior (leave blank for non-fire events):
“Night, light interior burning no significant movement”Also from the Grass Valley Fire report;
Significant events today (closures, evacuations, significant progress made, etc.):
“Damage assessment, mitigate work rest issues that exist, CA-IMT #1 takes command of Slide 0600. NorCal Team II remains in command of the Grass Valley Fire. Both incidents will be unified in planning and resource allocation”
Projected incident movement/spread during next operational period (in 12, 24, 48, and 72 hour time frames): 12 hours:
“With winds decreasing expect little movement, still concern regarding the current wind shift and reversal of the fire”Slide Fire Information from the 209 report;
26: Communities/Critical Infrastructure Threatened (in 12, 24, 48 and 72 hour time frames):12 hours: 
“Green Valley, Running Springs, Live Oak, Fredalba, Smiley Park, Calavery Chapel Camp, National Children’s Forest and Visitors Center, Arrowbear lake, Snow Valley, Nordic Rim Ski Area and Deer Lick 24 hours: Fiberoptic lines, cell sites, gas lines, water storage and distribution, SOCAL Edison powerlines.”Major problems and concerns (control problems, social/political/economic concerns or impacts, etc.) Relate critical resources needs identified above to the Incident Action Plan.
“High density residential properties intermixed amongst bug killed timber, with poor to limited access, lack of resources, continued adverse weather and extremly dry fuels. Inability to fully assess structure loss due to fire activity.”Slide Fire homes lost, according to the incident 209 report is # Destroyed 200Note;Robin Prince of the US Forest Service is reporting on channel 9 Los Angeles that only 2 homes have burned in the Slide Fire and 100 lost in the Grass Valley Fire.It’s astounding the Forest Service would put this spokeswoman on the air without proper consultation and training.She and the Forest Service have to know the people evacuated and waiting for word from their communities are not well served when given conflicting data.The community deserves better from (off site) media relations personnel who have no other work to do but prepare press releases and deal with the media.Shameful and irresponsible!

Harris Fire, 200 Homes Destroyed, 10% Containment
3 comments






The question to which fire is burning Lyons Peak is answered in the Incident 209 report for the Harris fire filed 0600 today. Fox 11 briefly showed structures burning in one of the communities within the Harris Fire boundaries. An unpopulated peak is a non story in comparison.
I heard a fire crew from Mexico offered their services and were turned down. Sometimes you have to wonder who is making decisions. One firefighter friend of mine wondered aloud why they aren’t mining healthy guys from the Qualcom parking lot.Yeah I know liabilities etc… There would be lawyers lining up, sadly.
More from the Harris Fire official incident report;
Significant events today (closures, evacuations, significant progress made, etc.):The fire was held at the edge of Chula Vista and San Miguel DPA. The returning onshore flow has moved the fire to the northeast threatening structures along Highway 94 from Jamul to the east and Jamacha to the west. Lyons Peak was burned and the fire jumped perimeter control lines in the area.
Major problems and concerns (control problems, social/political/economic concerns or impacts, etc.) Relate critical resources needs identified above to the Incident Action Plan.Extreme fire behavior due to fuel and weather conditions. East/northeast winds are active in the eastern portion of the fire. A more normal onshore flow is influencing the western portion. This wind confluence is causing erratic fire behavior. Heavy fuels and steep terrain on the northern edge of the fire present few control opportunities. Most resource orders remain unfilled due to competing incidents in the southern part of the state.
 Projected incident movement/spread during next operational period (in 12, 24, 48, and 72 hour time frames):12 hours: Fire will continue to move to the north and east.
 Remarks:CDF Team 9 is in unified command with Forest Service, San Diego City, Chula Vista and San Miguel. A total of 21 civilians have been injured and one killed by this fire. 4500 people are or have been threatened and evacuated. Additional evacuations are being ordered.

Resource requests are critical. An additional 452 people are assigned to the incident and are either enroute or were initial attack and have not been released from the line to check in. The total personnel count is 1211.Given the current constraints,  when will the chosen management strategy succeed?Low confidence. Personnel are exhausted. Some additional resources are trickling in.

Lyons Peak Webcam Overrun By Fire
1 comment






I’ve referred to the Lyons Peak webcam for 4 days now because it offers a 360′ view of the San Diego back country. I’ve also been watching as fire approaches Lyons Peak itself. This morning fire has assaulted the Lyon Peal Lookout and associated outbuildings.You can watch the assault on the Lyons Peak cam here.
You can assume the camera is toast if you get a blank screen.
Sadly, as much as I have spent monitoring these fires I have no idea what the name of the fire burning this peak is called. If it’s not a part of the Harris Fire it soon will be.

Harris Fire, 50 Homes Destroyed, Crews Exhausted
Comments Off






Below are points from the Incident 209 Report filed 0600 today. You can appreciate the heroic efforts being put forth by the firefighting personnel battling this blaze. If anyone needs help it is these guys.Note this significant fact; 275 total personnel on a 70,000 acre fire
” Significant events today (closures, evacuations, significant progress made, etc.):The fire burned 50+ homes in Deerhorn Valley Fire and Honey Springs, citizens are sheltered at Fire Station 66. Fire moved rapidly to the west/ southwest to Chula Vista and Otay Lake and north to the south end of Barrett Lake. Firefighters are engaged in protecting a critical Power Grid sub-station and a water treatment plant.
 Projected incident movement/spread during next operational period (in 12, 24, 48, and 72 hour time frames):12 hours: Fire will continue to move to the west/southwest and north given current weather conditions.
Given the current constraints,  when will the chosen management strategy succeed?No confidence. Personnel are exhausted and no additional resources have arrived.
Today’s observed fire behavior (leave blank for non-fire events):Extreme rates of spread. Structure consumption.
Remarks:An estimated 200 to 500 homes have been destroyed or damaged. 2000+ are threatened. One additional civilian suffered burns and was treated and transported to a local hospital. A total of 20 civilians have been injured and one killed by this fire. Smoke and weather conditions make air operations difficult. Over 3000 people have been evacuated. Additional evacuations are being ordered. Most resources have been engaged continuously since the beginning of the fire. Resource requests are critical.
Current Weather ConditionsWind Speed: 14 mph    Temperature: 76Wind Direction: N N/E       Relative Humidity: 8

Witch Fire Update
1 comment






Comprehensive blog coverage CBS8 San Diego.
I once lived in the region residing in Escondido, San Marcos and Del Mar. When I read earlier that Del Mar was being evacuated I couldn’t believe it. I also can’t get a grip on how 350,000 people evacuated the area. I doubt that number was reached. These are Katrina numbers.
CBS8 reports the notice;
“ DEL MAR MANDATORY EVACUATIONSEvacuations have been ordered for the following areas: South of Del Dios Highway, north of Sorrento Valley Road and west of Black Mountain Road to the ocean. Evacuees are being advised to go to centers at Carlsbad High School, Encinitas Senior and Community Center and Qualcomm Stadium.”
Witch Fire Evacuation Map
Speaking of Katrina, I am proud of my State. You don’t hear crying by affected residents to the press that the government isn’t doing enough for them. If you live in fire country and one buzzes your space it’s understood.  Through tragedy Californians buck up, count the pieces and rebuild.  As long as family and friends are safe all else can be replaced.  I’ve seen this all my life and have never heard anyone affected by wildfire in California blame the government for a natural disaster.
All I ever here is thank you to firefighters for their efforts!
On that subject firefighters are stretched thin, some going 24 hour shifts or more. Take a moment during the day tomorrow and offer a good thought for their safety.
Finally tonight it appears more than 1,000 homes have been lost between the fires in Arrowhead, San Diego County and Los Angeles County. Say a prayer for those families as well.

Harris Fire Update
Comments Off






The West view from the Lyons Peak webcam shows a fire front at the base of San Miguel Peak, between Jamul and Costa Mesa.
View Larger Map
Weather in Jamul is warm with winds gusting to 17 mph from the East.The wind will intensify through the night with winds in the 20 mph range until 11 am Tuesday.
Jamul is in a valley, winds on the peaks will be much higher according to the expanded report from the link above. Tuesday weather for the South County;
“Sunny…warmer. Areas of smoke and patchy blowing dust. Highs 92 to 97 in the western valleys to 88 to 93 near the foothills. Winds east 25 to 35 mph…diminishing to 20 to 30 mph late. Gusts to 65 mph…diminishing to 50 mph late.”
If you look at the south view from the webcam link this weather forecast can only mean more trouble for the very active south flank of the Harris Fire.
Fire facts from SDCountyEmergency.com;
“10-22-07 5:02 p.m. CAL FIRE update: The Harris Fire is well over 20,000 acres. Mapping and accuracy of acres is difficult due to rapid rate of fire spread. There is 0% containment and the fire’s spread is moving westerly towards Otay Lake. Firefighters are focusing all efforts on protection of life, property, and firefighter safety. SDGE’s Southwest major transmission line remains shut down.”
 When the wind subsides by sunset tomorrow, 10/23  this fire will lose its engine.
The official Incident 209 report (filed 1800 hrs 10/22 offers the following information;
Communities/Critical Infrastructure Threatened (next) 12 hours: Potrero, Barrett Junction, Barrett Lake area, Engineer Springs, Dulzura, Deerhorn Valley, Lawson Valley, Jamul, Lyons Valley area and Otay Mountain.
 Size/AreaInvolved          22,000 ACRES
 Injuriesto Date:5 (one in coma)
Projected Final Size:35,000
Projected incident movement/spread during next operational period (in 12, 24, 48, and 72 hour time frames):12 hours: Fire will continue to move to the west/southwest and north given current weather conditions.

Tijuana, Border Towns Affected By Harris Fire
2 comments






Little has been mentioned of the fire threat to Mexico border towns like Tijuana and Tecate. Reuters as well as news services in New Zealand and Canada have taken notice.
From Reuters:
“TIJUANA, Mexico, Oct 22 (Reuters) – Raging wildfires in Southern California cloaked neighboring Mexican cities in a fog of suffocating ash on Monday, shutting schools and businesses and a major U.S.-Mexico border crossing.
 The normally bustling city of Tijuana, just 20 miles (32 km) from San Diego County, where seven fires burned, virtually closed down as residents stayed indoors and those who ventured out walked around with paper masks over their mouths.
 A thin gray ash covered houses and cars and blotted out the sun in the Pacific port of Rosarito and the city of Tecate, where U.S. and Mexican officials closed the busy border crossing.

 “You can feel the heat of the fires from here. There’s ash everywhere, it is falling like rain,”
If the Harris Fire does reach the sea as predicted it will be impossible to keep flames from Tijuana Mexico and their nearly 2 million residents.

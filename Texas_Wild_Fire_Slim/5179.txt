The Onion looks back on 'cathartic' 9/11 issueBy Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Upshot – Tue, Aug 23, 2011

On September 10, 2001, employees of  the satirical national newspaper, The Onion, gathered at the Bowery Ballroom on Manhattan’s Lower East Side for a party to celebrate their first New York issue, which was due to be published the next day.The band They Might Be Giants performed. Whiskey flowed. Friends proposed.  The world, as far as these transplanted Wisconsiners were concerned, was theirs.But when they woke up the next day, as John Krewson, a longtime writer for The Onion, put it, “the world had changed.”Like many of his Park Slope neighbors, Krewson watched in horror from the roof of a Brooklyn brownstone, with a clear view of the World Trade Center, as the events of September 11th unfolded. He eventually went inside to turn on CNN for the rest of the afternoon.The September 11 issue of The Onion never made it to print.The next week, the staff — which had moved operations from Madison, Wisconsin, to Manhattan a few months before — gathered at The Onion’s offices on 20th Street. “It was a terrible meeting,” Krewson recalls. “We knew we wouldn’t be able to ignore what had happened, but it was hard to make any sort of comedy.”Eventually, Krewson remembers, one of the staffers said that American life had become “a bad Jerry Bruckheimer movie.”That headline, which would become a front-page story in the 9/11 issue, got the ball rolling, and loosened everyone up, Krewson says.Another one, by former head writer Carol Kolb, got the comedic juices flowing even more.Not Knowing What Else To Do, Woman Bakes American Flag Cake“It was poignant,” Krewson says. “It captured how stunned and confused everyone was at that time.”Others headlines followed:U.S. Vows to Defeat Whoever It Is We're At War WithHijackers Surprised To Find Selves in Hell: 'We Expected Eternal Paradise for This,' Say Suicide BombersGod Angrily Clarifies 'Don't Kill' RuleRest of Country Temporarily Feels Deep Affection for New YorkMassive Attack on Pentagon Page 14 NewsHugging Up 76,000 PercentThe Onion’s now-classic 9/11 issue was slowly but surely coming together. But the staff was still worried about how it would be received by a city still grieving from the worst terrorist attack ever on American soil.“Everyone thought this would be our last issue in print,” Krewson says.The Onion’s 9/11 issue -- its first in New York -- hit the streets on September 26. When staffers arrived in the office the next day, the fax machine was overflowing with comments from readers — virtually all of them positive.“The top one just read ‘That’s funny, that’s funny, that’s funny,’” Krewson says.Given the feedback, Krewson knew they had hit on something, though not necessarily comedy.“It wasn’t an especially funny issue. In fact, I’d say it was the least funny issue we’ve ever done,” Krewson says. “But it was cathartic.”“The hijackers piece — that is just brutal, brutal, physical comedy.”Nonetheless, it is, to this day, the most commented-on issue of The Onion.“Not a week goes by [that] I’m not asked about it,” Krewson says. “A lot of the younger writers — who weren’t around then — are sick of hearing about it.”Despite the enduring popularity of the 9/11 issue, don’t expect The Onion to join the rest of the media in revisiting the September 11 attacks on their 10th anniversary.“If we did something,” Krewson says, “it would mean we haven’t moved on.”Share your 9/11 memories with us on Twitter - #911remembered

historian paul fussell in "the great war and modern memory" says humor, especially the 'dark kind' is a mnemonic device used to make sense of what happens [when nothing apparently can...or will]. the onion has done this to perfection. 

now i hope they'll use it for other disasters. and bobble head news reporters too.

thanks to the onion for keeping things in perspective. why should we define our lives by 9/11? because media and others directly effected by it tell us so? is it because we had no "war" [ie great war as in ww2] to unite us, we use 9/11? what about disasters that happen to people in other areas of the country? if 9/11 had happened in any other city [save l.a. or d.c.] would we be hearing about it and forced into a manufactured reverence? let me make one thing clear ~ having questions and things that bother the conscience, in NO WAY denigrates the deaths/memories/contributions of the rescuers/workers/fatalities AND means little in reference to one's patriotism. "love it or leave it" mentality doesn't work ~ not on people, pets or our country. you love it, faults and all. we were patriotic long before 9/11; the first thing we did moving into a new house was put out our american flag. yes, i know all about "where were you when". i just prefer to define for myself rather than have it done for me.

"The US Vows to Defeat Whoever It is We're At War With."? Hardly cathartifc -  After the thousands lost in the towers we went on a rabid-frantic attack with other countries who had nothing to do with 911 and we gave up another few thousands lives - so, is it mission accomplished yet?

I love the hijackers-wake up-in-hell story, quite a classic

Actually, nothing "The Onion" does was ever at all funny.

I remember thinking how brave this issue was.  It would have been so much easier for them to simply skip a week or two, wait until the initial sting was gone.  This showed that not only were Americans not going to ignore this but the terrorists had not succeeded in breaking our spirit.

The best cover of any magazine, I laughed my #$%$ off!

It was a brilliant edition -- rage and pain giving birth to humor.  One of the most pitch-perfect responses to a national crisis I've ever seen.

It was really good. The issue also had a good explanation of the "blowback" which created The Movement.

We're hearing about it now as part of a 9/11 porn campaign. BLR is my porn name, and I know porn when I see it. The Bin Laden assassination has forced it to somber/celebration rather than the fear-fear-fear parade. Wonderful timing, that.

And we're hearing about this now because.....?  Anyway, I'm a big fan of The Onion, but never saw this issue.  I wouldn't have thought it funny so soon after the attack, but reading it now, I'm okay with it.

on the contrary, Cory.  humor is a powerful coping tool.  they didn't seek to diminish the experience of 9/11, but to find a way to share it with others.

That's pretty humorless and distasteful...

24/7 Wall St: If you decided on a new career path today, wouldn’t you like to know which jobs will be in high demand and pay the most once you were out of school? To serve as a guide, 24/7 Wall St. has identified the best-paying jobs of the future. These jobs will grow the most in the next decade and have median incomes well above the national average. Almost without exception, these occupations will be in highest demand because of changes in the nation’s population and in the way the country’s businesses operate.
Read The Best Paying Jobs Of The Future
One change that will create high demands for some professions is the increasing amount of data available to businesses. It is expected to grow 50 times over the next decade, according to predictions from technology research firm IDC. In an effort to make sense of the vast quantities of information, businesses will need employees who can understand and organize the data in a meaningful way. Professions such as market research analysts and management analysts will be in high demand.Another change is the aging population.
This year, the first baby boomers turned 65. As this generation greys, their needs will change. Their growing numbers and increasing medical needs will require more health care professionals to care for them. In particular, doctors, nurses and dental hygienists will all be in much greater demand. These new retirees will also increasingly look for help from personal financial advisors to navigate their investments.
24/7 Wall St. reviewed Bureau of Labor Statistics’ National Employment Matrix, which provides projected growth between 2008 and 2018 for the Bureau’s 750 major job categories. We then identified the jobs that are going to add the largest number of new positions — at least a 20% increase — and then selected those that had a median annual income of at least $60,000. These reflect the best-paying jobs that will also have the highest demand for new workers in the future.

> Total new jobs (2008-2018): 62,800
> Pct. increase: 30.1%
> Median income: $64,750
> States with most jobs per capita: New York, Connecticut, Delaware

Personal financial advisors assist people with their taxes, investments, and insurance. According to the BLS, "Growing numbers of advisors will be needed to assist the millions of workers expected to retire in the next 10 years. As more members of the large baby boom generation reach their peak years of retirement savings, personal investments are expected to increase and more people will seek the help of experts." By 2018, the number of personal financial advisors is expected to increase by more than 60,000, a 30% growth from 2008. This rate is well more than the national average of job growth of 10.1%. Because of the level of certification required, as well as the long hours and heavy traveling, advisors are paid well. The median wage for this position is $64,750.

By the time I graduate, I'll be to old to practice and then I can retire without having to pay back the hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans.

				Mostly math and science jobs that require 4 years of college or heavy experience­.

Best paying jobs of the future? The catch: Most people cannot attain them either because of lack of experience or having to go back to college again while already owing on loans, or the job creation falls under one work category. What if you do not excel in math or science? No diversity.

				I love the prediction of tech jobs.... Well why are so dang many engineer and tech jobs in this country unemployed­? Why are the largest companies outsourcin­g every job they can?

My job is to automate more of our service desk tasks so we can move more of those jobs overseas to less trained work forces. 

I would not recommend a young person to take computer science or engineerin­g until they see their parents being rehired.

				This is why I'm in manufactur­ing engineerin­g. Too many mechanical­, aerospace, and EE's. Manufactur­ing was always overlooked by management­, yeah who'd've thunk it? Management not knowing what to do. But now with efficiency and production being critical to survival, manufactur­ing engineers are finally being recognized as some of the most important engineers to hire. You really can't offload manufactur­ing to the traditiona­l engineers. Automation­, production­, workforce management­, quality control, materials, safety, all emphasized in the manufactur­ing engineerin­g degree. None of the other engineerin­g discipline­s can claim such as they are far more specialize­d in their field.

				I would not steer someone away from computer science. There is a difference between an entry level tech/ it job and a software developer. My boyfriend just graduated in may with a degree in computer science and excels in high performanc­e computing. He had more job offers then he could respond to, not one under 60k a year. His accolades might be more than the average cs graduate (departmen­tal scholar, national recipient of many awards etc) but every person he graduated last semester is working as at least a qa tester, and most are level one software developers­. I would not recommend anyone get a degree in cs unless that is an actual interest for them, your not going to get through the work if you don't enjoy writing code. I wish I had was able to do it, we graduated at the same time and he makes twice what I do as a social worker!

				be warned.  anyone who wants to become a nurse must remember that 50% of nurses are no longer working in the field of nursing 18 months after they graduate.  why?  the work is very physical, the stress of getting your charting done on time and taking care of patients can be overwhelmi­ng, and a majority of nurses work in a hostile environmen­t.  my job was working on a medical teaching floor in a hospital and it was awful.  we never had supplies and we were always shorthande­d.  the doctors can be really condescend­ing (especiall­y the new residents who think they are god).  i quit after 4 months.  i'm surprised i stayed that long. now i'm working as a health coach.

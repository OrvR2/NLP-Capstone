Who are the winners and losers in the U.S. debt debate?
WASHINGTON  (AP) — The U.S. avoided a feared and catastrophic default on the  American debt, as lawmakers on Tuesday passed a measure that ties an  agreement to raise the government's capacity to borrow to steep cuts in  government spending.
The  Senate passed the measure Tuesday, a day after it passed the House of  Representatives, and President Barack Obama quickly signed it into law.
The  emergency bill increases the nation's $14.3 trillion cap on borrowing,  thus avoiding default just hours before the midnight deadline, and  begins the process of curbing the country's spiraling debt.
Who do you feel were the winners and losers – political or otherwise – in the U.S. debt debate?

I am about convinced to just turn the top office over to a woman. These seem to do most of the budget management in households, so let's see what they can do with the country household budget.

The Democrats goal was to wait until the last minute to raise the debt ceiling so they could steal more money out of our IRAs. They took $4600.00 out of my IRA today.
Notice how "The One" never looks at you when he talks, talks, talks, on television. He spent millions of $$$$$ to get to Washington and then he spends all his time getting out of Washington on vacation trips. When was the last time you had a vacation? I think we need a real "black" man for President....Herman Cain: www.hermancain.com.

Its time both parties do what the people have been telling them to do during the last two years! 1) get rid of Obama's joke of a health care bill, 2) Cut budget of EPA 50%, 3) cut budget 50% of useless Department of Education, 4) cut all IRS jobs that would be need to enforce #1 and 50% of rest of IRS and pass law that EVERYONE PAYS 15% income tax. I could go on and one with useless studies that Feds pay for that cost Billions but way should I since more and more people think the government is around to give them everything they want.

As always the American middle class is the loser, the very wealthy are the winners, and the ranks of the poor just increased again. As far as the President and Congress, it's a draw. As far as the political parties, it's a draw. But, no central government means no United States. Having a weak central government or one that does not take care of its Constitutional responsibilites, and there is no United States. The biggest problem of all is that when money talks politicians listen. When the average American talks, all they get is a nice little form letter implying we got your message, but we listen to the money. TP has thrown in a wrench which will take time to work itself out.

The government is always the winners because they never feel the pain or suffering the average American worker feels.  They are never without a job, will always get paid while they threaten everyone such as the military, veterans, retirees, and they will always receive a retirement and health care regardless of the results of their performance while serving.  "We the people" are the losers and always will be.  Think about this, how is that they have the check book and the authority to right themselves a pay raise whether deserving or not, and we get higher taxes and less money.  The major reason the nation is in the shape it is in is because the elected officials put us there through their because of their decisions.  Not because of the average working American who tries to be an active and productive member of society.

I'm against almost all government spending, so I guess my side's obvious.

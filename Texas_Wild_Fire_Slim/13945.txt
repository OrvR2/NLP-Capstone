Weather Outlook:
A surface ridge of dry high pressure will maintain a dry air mass over the Lone Star State into early in the week as it gradually begins to shift on off to the east of the area. Winds across the panhandle and deep south Texas south of Interstate 10 will have a southerly component today. Even as dew points begin to increase in some areas, warmer temperatures will lead to continued low relative humidity. Among the driest locations in the state today will be those near the Interstate 35 corridor and east, where winds could be around 10 mph sustained for a brief period in the afternoon to early evening. Wind gusts approaching 15 mph are possible in this area.
High temperatures will continue on a warming trend ranging from the mid-80s to upper 90s in most places. However, high temperatures will exceed 100 over some parts of South Texas.Poor overnight recoveries will continue for areas away from the coast, especially locations west of Interstate 35. Very dry conditions again today. Light and variable winds in the morning becoming northwesterly 6-8 mph gusts to 10-15 mph. the sea breeze should move into the areas south of a Woodville to Conroe line late in the afternoon. Afternoon humidity falling to 11-16 percent except south of the sea breeze where relative humidity will only fall to around 35 percent. Skies will be mostly sunny throughout the day in the north and will become partly cloudy after 10 a.m. in the south. Afternoon highs 92-101. Moderate overnight recoveries of 55-65 percent north and 75-95 percent in the south.

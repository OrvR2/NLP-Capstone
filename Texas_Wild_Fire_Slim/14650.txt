Gaddafi's Helicopters Transporting Foreign African Mercenaries to Fashloum (Tripoli) (Feb., 2011)

Gaddafi's son, Khamees, is transporting Black African mercenaries from a military base in the town of Tajura (20 km east of Tripoli, Libya). Gaddafi's six sons are each in charge of a battalion controlling the foreign African mercenaries. The mercenaries came from many African countries such as Chad, Guinea, Niger, Somalia, Ethiopia, Mauritania, and Sudan to crush the Libyan citizens' resistance to Gaddafi's brutal dictatorship. The narrator says (translated from Libyan-Arabic): "These planes are going to Fashloum. The planes are coming now (a reference made to the attention of Al-Jazeera TV channel)... They are going to crush our Libyan sons. This is the second squadron that passed by. These (the planes) are filled with mercenaries. They came from Khamees' (one of Gaddafi's sons) battalion in Tajura." Reports say some west African newspapers advertise "Men Wanted for Tough Tasks". Under the general guise of 'hard work', the West African mercenaries to travel to Libya to fight and kill the Libyan citizens. The foreign African mercenaries are promised payment of $2000 per day. Al-Jazeera TV channel reported that approximately 150000 foreign African mercenaries are present in Libya. As of February 23, 2011, it is estimated that 50000 mercenaries are present in Tripoli under the leadership of Gaddafi's several sons' private battalions. This continues to happen while world governments permit it.

Minerva in ancient Roman mythology is the Goddess of War. Her birthday is March 19th, the same date we invaded Iraq and Libya. The four following her birthday are a celebration of bloodshed as an offering to the goddess. Minerva is a common figurehead and symbol of the Illuminati, Freemasonry and the US Government. The US Army Congressional Medal of Honor features the Minerva figurehead enclosed in the center of an inverted pentagram, an upside down five pointed star commonly associated with and recognized as a symbol of satanism, lucifer and the occult. This same star is also used in Illuminati, freemasonry and US government. Just some observations and things I recently learned and wanted to share with you.

Why Do 80% of Brits not care about the royal wedding? BECAUSE THEY ARE GERMAN EUGENICIST PARASITES

The UK taxpayers rather than the royal family will actually pay for the lavish USD 48 million ceremony in London. This is while Britons already pay some GBP 40 million a year to maintain the British royal family. April 29 has been declared a national holiday to mark Prince William's marriage to Kate Middleton in London's Westminster Abbey. The one-day holiday is also estimated to cost Britain about USD 10 billion. To compound the situation, the upcoming royal extravaganza comes at a time of worsening economic conditions in Britain, which is struggling with a massive budget shortfall. The British government is taking austerity measures in an attempt to contain the country's huge budget deficit. The eye-watering measures have already sparked violent protests nationwide. This is while more than 2.5 million Britons are also unemployed. Analysts say Prince William's wedding is reminiscent of the Queen's marriage to Prince Philip in 1947, which came against the backdrop of food rationing and post-World War II weariness. Some observers believe the British government is using the upcoming Royal Wedding to distract the Britons from their economic woes. Meanwhile, a recent poll shows Britons are far less excited about the Royal Wedding than the extensive flattery of media coverage suggests. The poll carried out by the campaign group Republic has shown that almost 80 percent of the Britons simply do not care about the so-called big day.

Just brainstorming and voicing my thoughts in regards to the federal government budget and the national debt / deficit. We need to increase GDP to lower our debt to GDP ratio. We need to LOWER corporate tax for those whom PRODUCE GOODS that contribute to our GDP. We need to INVEST MORE in farming to increase food supply which will also lower prices AND contribute to GDP President Obama has allocated $159.3 BILLION for the war in Afghanistan, yet the government needs to cut $61billion in spending... DUH... It don't take a fucking rocket scientist to figure out we should PULL OUT OF AFGHANISTAN.... What is the purpose... what is the goal... GET THE FUCK OUT AND SAVE THAT FUCKING MONEY... Additionally, the government pissed away anywhere from 5 to 10 billion on invading Libya... we should BUTT OUT OF THE INTERNAL CONFLICTS OF FOREIGN NATIONS..... TAKE CARE OF OUR SELVES.. FUCKE EVERYONE ELSE... Also, STOP SENDING OUR FUCKING TAX DOLLARS TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS... IE: ISRAEL, EGYPT, ETC, ETC... I know foreign aid only accounts for 1% of the budget, but still.. the government does NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE FROM ME AND SEND IT TO A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.... Foreign aid dollar figures do not include military aid and other aid... STOP GIVING OUR FUCKING MONEY AWAY TO OTHER NATIONS.. I forgot to mention it in the video, but being in the UN costs us money too.. The US is responsible for 25% of the UN annual budget of 5 to 6 billion.... GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE UN....

Freedom for Egypt & Palestine - Edinburgh demo of solidarity pt 1

Author: TrishMaryHill


Scots people showed solidarity with the Egyptian people when they demonstrated in Edinburgh at the Mound off Princes Street on Sat 5th February 2011. The demo was organised by the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign as part of a world-wide call for manifestations of solidarity demanding freedom for Egypt and all those oppressed in the Arab world by corrupt dictators and puppets of the Western governments. Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak has been in power for 30 years, even longer than Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali the dictator in Tunisia who was in power for 23 years. People in Egypt, like Tunisia, are fed up with government corruption and lack of jobs, and in Egypt people have also lived with the shameful fact that their dictatorship government has also been a puppet of the US and Israel and has greatly contributed to the suffering of their neighbours the Palestinian people, especially just over the border in Gaza. The Palestinian people have been oppressed by Israel since the state was set up with more and more land being appropriated till now only a fraction of Palestine remains, split into two small areas, with the Gaza strip being under blockade since the more militant Hamas party democratically won the elections in Palestine. Members of the Fatah party who were the previous Palestinian government were corrupt and in the pockets of the Israeli government, so it was no surprise that Hamas who would not sell-out to Israel were elected. But they were pleasantly surprised <b>...</b>

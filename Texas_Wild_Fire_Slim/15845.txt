WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama telephoned Texas Governor Rick Perry, his main Republican rival,  to offer aid in battling wildfires that have destroyed 1,000 homes and claimed four lives.Obama offered his condolences for the lives lost and pledged any further help necessary after answering the governor's call for eight fire management assistance grants in the last few days, the White House said."Today the president called Texas Governor Rick Perry to express his concern for citizens of Texas impacted by the unprecedented fires," the statement said."The president also assured the governor that requests for additional assistance, including as recovery begins, would be quickly assessed."The Texas Forest Service said cooler temperatures and slowing winds had helped firefighters on Wednesday to bring the largest blaze some 30 percent under control."Since Sunday we have had four fatalities and we have still got assessment teams on the ground trying to determine a good number for houses destroyed," April Saginor, a spokeswoman for the service, told AFP."We are saying right now that more than 1,000 have burned down since Sunday," she said, adding that additional aircraft had been brought in to control more than 30 blazes concentrated in central and eastern Texas."In the past seven days we have responded to 172 fires that have burned 135,000 acres," Saginor said.In the frontline town of Bastrop, helicopters and planes loaded with water ran constant relays to douse the infernos as firefighters converged around homes catching fire along the state highway."Waiting is the most frustrating thing," said Gina Thurman, 47, choking back tears as she sat by herself on a curb outside a shelter in Bastrop."You're sitting there and you don't know anything but your house is probably burning."More than 3.5 million acres (1.4 million hectares) -- about the size of the state of Connecticut -- have been burned by a record 18,700 blazes since the wildfire season began in December.The first two fatalities were reported in eastern Texas, where a fast-moving fire is believed to have killed a 20-year-old woman and her child who failed to get out of their trailer home in time Sunday. Crews discovered two more bodies in charred wreckage near the state capital Austin on Tuesday.The disaster forced Perry, considered the frontrunner in the Republican race for the White House in 2012, to cancel campaign events in South Carolina on Tuesday but he made it to his first major election debate on Wednesday evening in California.

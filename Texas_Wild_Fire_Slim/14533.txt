Alter bridge - Metalingus. [HQ] [HD] Lyrics: I've been defeated and brought down Dropped to my knees when hope ran out The time has come to change my ways On this day I see clearly everything has come to life A bitter place and a broken dream And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind I'll never long for what might have been Regret won't waste my life again I won't look back I'll fight to remain: On this day I see clearly everything has come to life A bitter place and a broken dream And we'll leave it all behind On this day its so real to me Everything has come to life Another chance to chase a dream Another chance to feel Chance to feel alive Fear will kill me, all I could be Lift these sorrows Let me breathe, could you set me free Could you set me free On this day I see clearly everything has come to life A bitter place and a broken dream And we'll leave it all behind On this day its so real to me Everything has come to life Another chance to chase a dream Another chance to feel Chance to feel alive --------------------------------------------------------- Trivia. * Myles Kennedy - lead vocals, rhythm guitar * Mark Tremonti - lead guitar, backing vocals * Brian Marshall - bass guitar * Scott Phillips - drums, percussion Formation (2004) The band was formed in 2004 by Mark Tremonti and Scott Phillips, both members of Creed, which had gone through a breakup due to issues with singer Scott Stapp. According to Tremonti, "Creed had taken its course," and both he and <b>...</b>

Music Video for Alter Bridge's Watch Over You. Ripped personally by me from rage here in Australia. Enjoy ABers. Unfortunately i saved this video is in fake widescreen (4:3 with black bars) so Youtube isn't displaying it as widescreen. My apologies, hopefully soon they'll add a function in where i can set the aspect ratio. Lyrics: Leaves are on the ground Fall has come Blue skies turning grey Like my love I tried to carry you And make you whole But it was never enough I must go [Chorus:] Who is gonna save you When I'm gone? And who'll watch over you When I'm gone? You say you care for me But hide it well How can you love someone And not yourself? [Chorus] And when I'm gone Who will break your fall? Who will you blame? I can't go on And let you lose it all It's more than I can take Who'll ease your pain? Ease your pain [Chorus:] Who is gonna save you when I'm gone? Who'll watch over you? Who will give you strength when you're not strong. Who'll watch over you when I've gone away? Snow is on the ground Winters come You long to hear my voice But I'm long gone

Author: Seph1989


A short video showing me and some friends getting the "Brighe Over Trebled Slaughter" achivement in L4D2 on expert realism.. In order to get it you need to cross the bridge in the parish finale in less than 3 minutes. our strategy was to save some useful items for the finale, which made it pretty easy as you can see in the video, however saving these items is harder than using them. if you want to have it really easy i recommend just playing it on easy difficulty and then saving the items as we did. i used the demo smoother for the first time in this video so dont expect it to be perfect, it will be usefull for other videos im going to make in the future though. demo smoother tutorial: www.youtube.com demo download link (for the skeptics): rapidshare.com Important: since demos stop working after updates you have to edit the file "steam.inf" in your /left4dead2/ folder all you have to change is the first line to "PatchVersion=2.0.0.3" now you will be able to watch the demo even after updates. switch the number back to whatever it was after you have watched the demo.

Pop Pilgrims - Seattle: Kurt Cobain Park

Author: theavclub


Are you a bad person for wanting to see where Kurt Cobain died? And not just died, but violently took his own life after a long, sad battle with depression and drug addiction? Short answer: No. Longer answer: No, as long as you don't trespass or misbehave. The house at 171 Lake Washington Blvd. East—more specifically, the benches in park next to it—is all Nirvana fans have. Cobain has no grave and, until April of this year, no memorial. (His hometown of Aberdeen, Washington, erected a statue in his honor by the famous Young Street Bridge.) After Cobain's suicide in early April of 1994, fans flocked to Viretta Park, and 17 years later, they still do by the thousands every year. Even Google Maps calls it "Kurt Cobain Park."

Tell me, who would even care? So much time has passed I'd still meet you anywhere Water under bridge Evening after day What is left of love Here that didn't drift away? I can remember days of sun We knew our lives had just begun We could do anything, we're fearless when we're young Under the moon, address unknown I can remember nights in Rome I thought that love would last, a promise set in stone I'd survive with only memories If I could change the way I feel But I want more than only memories A human touch to make them real Another day, another dream Over the bridge an empty scene We'd spend the weekend lost in bed and float upstream I don't know why we moved away Lost in the here and now we strayed Into a New York zone, our promise was betrayed I was there, caught on Tenth Avenue You elsewhere with Culver City blues Then and there I knew that I'd lost you What is left of love? Tell me, who will even care? So much time has passed I'd still meet you anywhere Water under bridge Evening after day What is left of love Here that didn't drift away? Don't give me all your nothern pain Don't sell me New York in the rain Let's leave our promises behind Rewind and try again What remains in time that didn't fade <b>...</b>

Underrated, but never forgotten. Black Tambourine is by far one of the best bands to emerge by incorporating a perfect blend of fuzz and pop. I still remember buying a crayon colored sleeve 7" (By Tomorrow) at Vinyl Ink so long ago when I lived in Maryland. I was a fan for life by the time Throw Aggi Off The Bridge was released. These songs still give me goose bumps after all these years. Sooo good!

The Lost Evidence: Operation Market Garden (1/5)

Author: prodigywashere


Operation Market Garden (September 1725, 1944) was an Allied military operation, fought in the Netherlands and Germany in World War II. It was the largest airborne operation of all time. The operation plan's strategic context required the seizure of bridges across the Maas (Meuse River) and two arms of the Rhine (the Waal and the Lower Rhine) as well as several smaller canals and tributaries. Crossing the Lower Rhine would allow the Allies to outflank the Siegfried Line and encircle the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland. It made large-scale use of airborne forces whose tactical objectives were to secure a series of bridges over the main rivers of the German-occupied Netherlands and allow a rapid advance by armoured units into Northern Germany. Initially the operation was successful and several bridges between Eindhoven and Nijmegen were captured. However the ground force's advance was delayed by the demolition of a bridge over the Wilhelmina Canal at Son, delaying the capture of the main road bridge over the Meuse until September 20. At Arnhem the British 1st Airborne Division encountered far stronger resistance than anticipated. In the ensuing battle only a small force managed to hold one end of the Arnhem road bridge and after the ground forces failed to relieve them they were overrun on the 21st. The rest of the division, trapped in a small pocket west of the bridge, had to be evacuated on the 25th. The Allies had failed to cross the Rhine in sufficient force, and <b>...</b>

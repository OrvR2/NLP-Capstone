CHAINSAW SAFETY









[ Print | 

 ]



Chainsaws are inherently dangerous! Here are a few guidelines to follow anytime you operate a chainsaw:


Always read the Operating Manual thoroughly prior to operating a saw.


Follow all Manufacturer Safety Guidelines for starting, cutting and fueling.


Wear protective equipment: chaps, gloves, earplugs and a hardhat (in case of kickback or falling debris).


Ensure firm footing, remove loose material from underfoot; spread feet in a wide balanced stance.


Keep work area clear to avoid tripping hazards.


Always maintain control; keep a firm grip on the saw.


Always be alert to saw kickback.


Never cut above chest height, control is difficult.


Use a pole saw for cuts above your head.


Do not over-reach or under-reach when cutting; you will be off balance.


Estimate what the reaction of what you're cutting will be; will it whip up, down or toward you.

Identify and keep an escape route clear.

Remember even the smallest injury with a chainsaw usually requires professional medical attention.

There are a few things Jessica Simpson will always be known for: confusing tuna for chicken, wondering if a buffalo has wings and her curvy figure. 
So when In Touch reported that the singer and former reality star was looking to downsize her assets so she would look smaller on her wedding day,  Jessica took to Twitter to set the record straight.  

She tweeted:
  Been getting lots of questions about this alleged breast reduction...not to worry...I LOVE MY BOOBIES!! They aren't going anywhere!less than a minute ago via web  Favorite  Retweet  ReplyJessica SimpsonJessicaSimpson 

It's no secret that Jessica has struggled with her weight, but her breasts have always received positive attention -- even from those who probably shouldn't talk about them.  
In 2004, her father Joe Simpson told the GQ, "Jessica never tries to be sexy. She just is sexy. If you put her in a T-shirt or you put her in a bustier, she's sexy in both. She's got double Ds! You can't cover those suckers up.

"Is it chicken or tuna" Yea, real genius.

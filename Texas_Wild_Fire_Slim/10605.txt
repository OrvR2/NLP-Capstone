HOW TO REGENERATE A PINE FOREST









[ Print | 

 ]



These guidelines are designed to assist the private forest landowner in artificially regenerating a pine forest on land not currently classified as forestland. This includes open pastures, hay meadows, fallow fields and any other areas relatively free of trees as well as harvested timber stands.What steps do I need to take to successfully regenerate a pine forest?Consider Hiring a Professional ForesterThough some steps in the process seem obvious, hiring a professional forester can give the landowner a decided advantage in achieving the desired outcome.  Professional foresters can also help you decide if natural regeneration would be appropriate for your site.  They are trained and experienced in most aspects of reforestation, and can offer private landowners help in understanding what to do, which specific treatment is the most beneficial for the site, and what is the most feasible. (A Referral List of Professional Management Foresters is enclosed.)  Professional foresters are invaluable in helping landowners with the following:determining soil typeestimating acreagedeveloping mapssecuring and caring for the proper seedling typesite preparation treatmentsvendor selectionselecting the appropriate tree planting methods & proceduresdetermining proper pest management applicationEvaluate Soil and Create a Map of the SiteDetermine whether the soil type is appropriate for planting pine treesThe local Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) can help with soils information and delineationDevelop a map showing the location and acreage to be plantedSelect SeedlingsDetermine the seedling type and genetic line best suited to the soil type.Purchase the appropriate number of seedlings for the acreage involved.Order SeedlingsOrder early in the tree-planting season to ensure availability.A list of sources is enclosed. (See Loblolly Pine Seedling Sources).Prepare the SiteDetermining the appropriate method of site preparation is critical because this is one of the most expensive parts of the planting process ($30.00 to $400.00 per acre).Quality site preparation will greatly benefit seedling survival and growth.Select a Tree Planting VendorEngage a tree-planting vendor early in the year to ensure getting the best vendor possible.Check references and ask to see a tract or two that they have planted.Planting costs will depend on access to, condition of the site, number of acres to be planted, number of seedlings to be planted per acre, and the location of the tract.Types of tree planting operations:Hand planting is often performed by crews of 2 to 40 individuals planting 1 to 3 acres per day per person.  Seedlings are planted by persons who walk across the tract, using a hand tool to plant the pine seedlings, one by one.Machine planting is usually done using a rubber-tired tractor or bulldozer that pulls a planting machine that cuts a furrow into the ground.  An individual riding the planting machine plants a seedling in that furrow, then the packing wheels on the planter close the furrow back around the seedling.A Tree-Planting Vendor list, a list of questions to ask when securing a vendor and a sample Tree Planting Agreement are enclosed in this packet.Caring for SeedlingsProper care given to the seedlings from the time of lifting at the nursery to planting is vital.  Because Texas has warm winter months, seedlings will need to be kept cool until planted.  Wind and sun can damage the seedlings.  Arrange for delivery of only the number of seedlings that will be planted within a few days.Some vendors have refrigeration units that can be placed at the site. Questions to ask them:Do they have a refrigerated trailer?How many seedlings per day can they plant?How many days’ planting they will pick up at once?  If more than one day’s planting is going to be picked up, how will the vendor provide protection and care of the seedlings?If you have your own storage facilities, it is often recommended that you pick the seedlings up yourself.  By doing this, you will know when the seedlings came out of the cooler and can be assured they have not been exposed to wind and sun.Discuss the care of the seedlings provided by the vendor.Seedlings should not be out of a cooler longer than 2 weeks in ideal weather conditions.Discuss the necessity for pruning the roots with the vendor.  Lateral and tap roots should be 5” to 7” long.  Use only pruning shears or scissors to cut them to a minimum length of 5”.Planting the SeedlingsDiscuss any additional concerns with your local Texas Forest Service reforestation forester or your private consulting forester before the actual planting begins.Tree planting occurs from late December through March.Optional ItemsPest management – Town ants and regeneration weevils can destroy the forest you so carefully planted.  Town ants are easily identified by the large colonies and should be treated before planting your tract.  If treatment is needed contact your Texas Forest Service Office. Regeneration weevils only occur on tracts where the pine timber has recently been harvested (within 6 months of the planting date).  If treatment is needed, when ordering your seedlings, ask the sales staff if they can treat your seedlings with Pounce.Maintain access – Keep roads clear and maintained to allow for easy access to the property.Fire breaks – Clear land around the planted trees to mineral soil to stop a fire from getting onto your property.  This will help protect them from wildfire and provide access for fire fighting equipment if needed.Approximate Treatment CostRead the Forestry Practices Cost Estimate Sheet 2010 to get a rough idea of how much it will cost you to regenerate a pine forest.General Time Table for Reforestation Treatments or Needs

XTree Planting Vendor QuestionsListed below are questions that you may want to ask a potential planting vendor. Since the planting will be done on your property and will be paid for by you, it is entirely appropriate for you to thoroughly check on prospective vendors.

Remember, it’s your land and your money.Have you received the certified vendor training offered by the Texas Forest Service?Have you ever planted trees under any of the cost share programs?Have you ever planted trees that were inspected by the Texas Forest Service?Have you ever planted trees in this County? If so, would you provide the names and addresses of a few of your last customers from last planting season from this county or a Consulting Forester you have worked with? Otherwise, could you furnish other names to me?What is your anticipated date of planting on my tract should you get the job?How would you handle getting the pine seedlings to the planting site?If you pick up the trees, are there any additional charges? If so, what are they?Describe your care for the seedlings while on the planting site.What type of planting tool do your planters use?Can you complete the work by March 1st?What considerations do you offer if you cancel my work and I cannot acquire another vendor at a comparable price or cannot acquire a vendor prior to February 15?Will you use a tree-planting contract originated by my agent or me?How can I contact you during tree planting season?Will you contact me at least 5 days prior to beginning work?Do you require your crew foreman to supervise and to remain on the planting site?Can you supply me with proof of Workers Compensation Insurance?Can you supply me with proof of Dept. of Labor registration?What type of formal training do you provide your planting personnel?Can we meet on my tract to discuss your bid and view the actual site?

Momentum builds behind Amanda Knox appealBy Mike KrumboltzMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz | The Envoy – 10 hrs ago

Is the incarceration of Amanda Knox coming to an end?
The American college student and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were found guilty of murdering Meredith Kercher in 2007. Knox has long proclaimed her innocence. Now, after Knox and Sollecito have spent years in prison and turned up for countless court appearances, an Italian prosecutor says that both suspects are likely to be acquitted.
According to the U.K. Telegraph, "court appointed experts have criticised the way the original forensic investigation was carried out by police." Knox won a recent victory in court, when the prosecutors' request to conduct further examinations on DNA evidence was denied. Independent experts contend that some of the DNA evidence against Knox should not have been admitted as evidence.
This doesn't necessarily mean that Knox will be freed, but it does give the jailed 24-year-old hope. Her days behind bars may come to an end if judges see things her way in the appeal. Below, a brief history of the case that has kept millions transfixed for years.Click on image to view photos of Amanda KnoxAmanda Knox, the U.S. student convicted of killing her British flatmate Meredith Kercher in Italy on November 2007, …
The crime: Knox, Sollecito, and a third man, Rudy Guede, were accused and jailed for the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher. Kercher, who was from England, was stabbed to death in the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy. She was also sexually assaulted.
The rumors: After Kercher's body was discovered, rumors began to swirl that the crime was some sort of sexual act gone horribly wrong. Many in the media took to referring to Amanda as Foxy Knoxy. Some people, including Knox's parents, felt that this nickname painted Amanda as some sort of seductress and helped convict her.
The evidence: Much of the case hinged on DNA taken from a 12-inch knife found at the murder scene. Investigators found Kercher's DNA on the blade, and Knox's on the handle. A recent review found that much of that DNA was unreliable and may have been contaminated by sloppy police work. That's good news for Knox.
The frenzy: Ever since the murder was reported, Web searches have been incredibly high. Even now, four years later, online interest in Knox remains huge. Over the past 24 hours, searches on "amanda knox" and "amanda knox trial" have both roared to huge gains. Not surprisingly, "foxy knoxy pictures" are also popular.
What's next: The closing arguments on the appeal are set to start later this month, on Sept. 23. Perhaps shortly thereafter, there will be real closure for all involved.

Even before the DNA evidence was presented, her guilt was assumed because she lied during the investigation to frame an innocent guy.

I read her story in Marie Claire, which was from 2009. According to the article, Amanda and her boyfriend were not in the house when the crime happened. What irritated me the most was when the police arrested them because they were not supposed to eat pizza after their friend died; they should be mourning for Meredith's death. I feel terribly sorry for her, her family, as well as her boyfriend; apparently, the justice system in that Italian province is, as quoted from this news, "sloppy." It was also mentioned in that article that Rudy had a crush with Meredith but she won't reciprocate it, which is a possibility that Rudy could be the suspect. I'm mad at him for doing so, but what's worse is that he confessed to his crimes, but quickly retracted them. Maybe he was actually paid. I hope everyone gets the justice they deserve.

I would absolutely destroy her vag.  She owes me.  For taking my attention away for two seconds to read her stupid court story when I was studying.  And I do mean destroy, as in urinary tract infection.

Before making any conclusions, I ask you all:
Is it better to put a LIKELY innocent person behind bars or a POSSIBLE murderer get away?

It doesn't make any sense at all for her to kill the kill. I sure as heck do not buy the sex games story... that is something that only a man can dream up... a sick man at that.The person that introduced that #$%$ story is the killer. Either the victim's boyfriend or hers.

Following the story closely.  She's big timed framed with British and Italian tabloid nonsense.  Good luck to her.

I was pretty convinced at first that she did it, but anyone who has really watcched this trial progress, if anything it shows how selfish people can end up being. The cops got sloppy, the boyfriend ratted her out when he suddenly had a deal in front of him. I for one believe she may be the only one innocent in all of this, and has the potential to completely screw her whole life over.

All I can say, I hope they get it right, just by reading stories doesn't give me any right to judge, and is very wrong to assume, some ones guilt, or innocence, just prey they get it right, it's the only way I know it.

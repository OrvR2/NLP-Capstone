Violence breaks out in pacified Rio slumBy FLORA CHARNER - Associated Press | AP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011





RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Soldiers patrolling a pacified slum in this seaside Brazilian city that will host the 2016 Olympics have come under gunfire from a neighboring area controlled by drug traffickers, authorities said Tuesday.There was no confirmation from authorities of deaths or injuries, but a witness in the Alemao complex of slums on Rio de Janeiro's north side told The Associated Press that civilians had been shot."We're not certain yet exactly what is going on," Marcus Boucas, a spokesman with the pacification force in the slum, told G1, the website of the Globo television network. "The police and soldiers are here to maintain the security of civilians."It was just last November that police invaded the Alemao complex of slums in the midst of a week of widespread violence across the city, mayhem blamed on drug gangs.For decades, Alemao had been key territory for Rio's biggest drug gang, the Red Command, and was thought to be impenetrable.The taking of the slum was the biggest victory yet for authorities in a policing program that uses elite units to push the gangs out of slums, then installs permanent bases and inserts community police to win over the citizens.Securing the city was one of the promises officials made in their bid to win the 2016 Olympics. The Alemao complex, which hugs a highway leading to the international airport, is a key area in this effort.Hundreds of soldiers continue to patrol the Alemao complex and are expected to remain until the middle of next year.In the past week, there have been clashes between soldiers and those living in the slum, who complain of heavy handed policing tactics.

why dont  the Brazillian government try taking over the slums with decent housing a plumbing system,good paying jobs,and adequate health care instead of using guns and brutal Gestapo like force.I am sure it would go across far better with the folks they call slum dwellers, after all,it was their labor and hard work as slaves that made Brazil as wealthy as it is today......nothing short of reparation for slavery can  rid  the western world of the guilt and shame of slavery

Getting rid of slums in Brazil is equal to ending famine in Africa, not going to  happen.

No matter your color, there was once slaves of every race so get over it.  Now were ALL slaves, "modern slavery" I would call it, where it catches everyone in the web no matter what color you be.

Bull doze the slums to the ground. Then build decent housing, but if you're a gangbanger no new pad for you and co.

I guess there is simply nothing anyone can do against drug violence.  It appears here to stay.

If the gang bangers are hauling in half the paper we're led to believe, why do they choose the nastiest places to live? Get cash, get the #$%$ out.

"Violence breaks out in pacified Rio slum"

This is illogical. Obviously this slum was not at peace. And deeper reading tells us the bullets came form outside said area.

If it is pacified, how can there be violence? This entire article is oxymorinic!!! I can't wait to attend the olympics and get some of that cheap Brazillina Twat and cheap dope. Hope the drug gangs win.

These slums are Individual Initiative housing, put together by Individuals with their own labor and Materials They Can Afford.   Our own Wave of the Future, after the 2012 election.

There's a documentary called "God,Guns and Gangs". 
It details the ongoing war between Cops and gangs in Rio's slums. Its quite a contrast to the travel brochures these travel agencies show you. Not a good idea to have the Olympics there.

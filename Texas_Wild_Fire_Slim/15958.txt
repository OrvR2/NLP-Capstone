No joke: Djokovic beats Nadal for US Open title




        By EDDIE PELLS, AP National Writer
        3 hours, 36 minutes ago

















NEW YORK (AP)—Novak Djokovic was on the wrong side of the court, and the
celebration, a year ago after the last ball was struck in the U.S. Open final.

Somewhere in the back of his mind, though, as he watched Rafael Nadal fall
to the blue concrete and bask in the lights of the world’s biggest tennis
stadium, Djokovic had a sense that someday, that could be him.
On Monday night, it was.
After defeating Nadal 6-2, 6-4, 6-7 (3), 6-1 over 4 hours and 10 minutes of
relentless, draining tennis, Djokovic dropped to his knees and kissed the same
concrete that Nadal ruled last year, celebrating a win that slapped an
exclamation point on one of the greatest seasons in the sport’s history.





A win that, in many ways, came out of a loss on the same court.
“I guess it just clicked in my head,” Djokovic said.
That he could beat these guys.
“I was always trying to wait for their mistakes and not having that
positive attitude and believing I could win,” Djokovic said. “This has changed
and U.S. Open 2010 was one of the turning points in my career, definitely.”
Djokovic won his third Grand Slam title of 2011 to match what Nadal
accomplished last year and what Federer did in 2004, 2006 and 2007. Djokovic
bested them both en route to this title, taking down Nadal two days after he
overcame two match points against Federer to win the semifinal.
The man they call “Nole” improved to 64-2 on the season. With a few months
left in 2011, the best win-loss record in the modern era—John McEnroe’s 82-3
in 1984—is in reach.
However it ends up, victory No. 64 may go down as the most impressive of
them all.
Over the first two sets, second-seeded Nadal broke top-seeded Djokovic’s
serve three times, and each time, Djokovic responded by doing what a champion
does—answering back right away, then not looking back.
But it was the third set that was the classic—84 can’t-miss minutes of
side-to-side, unforgiving play from both men, filled with cartoonishly punished
groundstrokes that somehow kept coming back.
Nadal won that set, Djokovic walked off the court holding his back and the
momentum shifted.
What that did, though, was allow the world’s top-ranked player to once again
drive home the point he’s been making all year: Yes, he improved his fitness
and, yes, he changed his diet. But mostly, he changed his attitude.
With his back and ribs aching and his legs started to cramp, he said he knew
he couldn’t allow the fourth set to turn into yet another long series of
rallies. He had to do what he’d been doing all year—go for it.
“I knew I wasn’t physically there,” Djokovic said. “I wasn’t as fit as I
was at the start of the match. I needed to take the chances I did. It was an
incredible set for me.”
Every bit as telling, and stunning, as any of the 17 winners Djokovic hit in
that fourth set (against only four unforced errors), was the way Nadal reacted
as the set wore on.
Instead of rushing, skidding, shuffling, reaching out to get one more ball
back as is his norm, he stood and watched.
Nadal watched at 30-all in the final game when Djokovic followed his serve
with a backhand winner down the line. He watched again on match point when
Djokovic hit a forehand down the line, then dropped his racket and fell to the
ground to celebrate in almost the exact spot where Nadal did last year.
A bit later, Djokovic pulled off his shirt and threw it into the stands,
then put on a dark hat with “FDNY” written on it—a nod to Sunday’s 10th
anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which both he and Nadal
mentioned during the trophy ceremony.
“I’ve had an amazing year and it keeps going,” Djokovic said.
A year ago, Nadal was being celebrated as the next King of Tennis, with nine
Grand Slams (Now 10, counting this year’s French Open) and seemingly in need of
nothing more than time and tournaments to match Federer, who holds the record
with 16. A year later, however, Nadal is on a six-match losing streak to
Djokovic—all of them in finals, including this one and at Wimbledon earlier
this summer.
“He’s having less mistakes than before,” Nadal said when asked to explain
the Djokovic renaissance. “In my opinion, that’s all. He’s confident enough in
every moment to keep believing in one more ball, one more ball. I think his
forehand is not more painful than before; his backhand is not more painful than
before; he serves the same.”
Things, however, are not all the same with Nadal.
Last year en route to the title, he lost five service games and credited
improvement there for finally figuring out how to win the only major he hadn’t
captured. In this tournament, he lost 24, including 11 in the final. Against
Djokovic, Nadal won only 52 percent of the points in which he got his first
serve in. He faced 26 break points. Against an opponent who spent most of the
night painting lines, this was not a winning formula.
“A lot of times I started the point in worse position than him when I was
serving,” Nadal said. “So that’s tough.”
Every time Djokovic hit one of those huge returns, it was hard not to think
back to Saturday, when, facing two match points against Federer in the
semifinals, he turned on Federer’s serve, taking a chance and pounding it back
for a clean, forehand winner—a shot already being touted as one of the single
greatest the game has seen.
Djokovic called it a gamble—but one he had no problem taking. He now joins
Andy Roddick, Pete Sampras, Boris Becker, Martina Navratilova and Manuel Orantes
as the sixth player to hoist the U.S. Open trophy after facing match point at
some point earlier in the tournament.
“In big matches, the winner is decided by small margins, a couple points,”
Djokovic explained. “I guess the winner is the one who believes in victory
more.”

Hey jock-itch - when your back packs in and you have to retire in a few years, will that be because you "Believe Less"? Spare us the self-congratulatory oral manure and go learn to win gracefully.

0 users disliked this comment Richard 10 minutes ago Report Abuse The article says this: Nadal won that set, Djokovic walked off the court holding his back and the momentum shifted.

But it fails to mention that at that point Djokovic called for a "medical" timeout at that point. During that timeout he was clearly shown on tv taking pills that the trainer did not provide.

Are players at the US Open allowed to take medication from their own pocket during a match?

Seems a suspect practice at best.

1 users disliked this comment C K 15 minutes ago Report Abuse Really getting very tired of seeing Nadal and Djokovic in the Finals again.   Tennis needs some young and new faces, I would be a lot more interested to watch the game if the new faces like Isner and Donald Young were playing instead.   Hopefully we will see some new faces next year, Federer and Nadal clearly are on the declines and some young players will have a good chance to challenge them.

0 users disliked this comment Mickey 46 minutes ago Report Abuse Why do none of the stories on Serena Williams allow for comments? 

Her diatribe is so typical of someone who lacks grace and class.   Telling the umpire that she is in America and can say what she wants just proves her arrogance.    A $2000 fine is a joke.

What normal food produces a body like that, I wonder.

4 users disliked this comment Andre Holland 46 minutes ago Report Abuse Tennis is now a bit of a game of rock-paper-scissors:

- Novak has Rafa's number
- Rafa has Roger's number
- Roger is the only one that can beat Novak, who is bothered by his style the most. (1 win and 2 match points)

this could be interesting in 2012. Roger's record seems safer now than it did 9 months ago, and the only one that can change that for the time being seems to be Roger himself!. Marion, I just got a $829.99 iPad2 for only $103.37 and my mom got a $1499.99 HDTV for only $251.92, they are both coming with USPS tomorrow. I would be an idiot to ever pay full retail prices at places like Walmart or Bestbuy. I sold a 37" HDTV to my boss for $600 that I only paid $78.24 for. I use BuzzSave.com

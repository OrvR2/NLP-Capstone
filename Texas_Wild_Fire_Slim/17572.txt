Houston Fire Rescues Windows Washers from 45th Floor
No comments







KIAH-TV Houston Reports: 
At about 11 a.m., the Houston Fire Department was called to the Wells Fargo Bank Plaza tower at 1000 Louisiana Street where three window washers were reported trapped on a dangling scaffold.
The workers were on the 45th floor of the 71-story building, officials said.
Rescue crews dropped rope about 450 feet down from the roof for the window washers to tie into their harnesses, then one rescue worker was lowered into the scaffold to help the three window washers get into a broken-out window.
Glass fell to the ground along McKinney Street, but no passers-by were reported injured from the debris.
The rescue mission took about 2 1/2 hours. None of the workers sustained any major injuries, officials said.

Authorities in South Carolina are trying to locate Keyundra Blassingame, a 16-year-old girl from Laurens, a city 73 miles northwest of Columbia. The girl has been missing for one week.
According to the Laurens Police Department, Blassingame was last seen on August 31, leaving her home on Young Drive. Blassingame told her foster mother, Crystal Peterson, she was going to meet friends and would return by dark. The teenager never returned and her whereabouts remain a mystery.
Blassingame has short black hair and brown eyes. She is 5' 5" tall and weighs about 230 pounds. She was last seen wearing a pink shirt and blue jean shorts.
Anyone with any information is asked to call the Laurens Police Department at 864-984-3532.

				another one missing. this is way to much how many hundreds of thousands or millions of people in each state go missing yearly. whats the total number of people missing alone in the whole united states. im baffled how many serial killers are really out there roaming our streets and rural areas scary. no one seem to know that either. is there a undergroun­d world they get taken to or what is it the rapture slowly happening.  where are the answers i hope shes safe and alive

				I see that when a person replies to the race card players, the comment doesn't get posted by the "moderator­s".  So I can't sit back an let one side be aired without being able to say my peace so I won't be bothered posting anymore.  Ridiculous­.  Just continue to give the haters their forum.

				I am here specifical­ly due to the comments that we don't pay attention when it isn't a white girl.  Let me say, however, there isn't much here to comment on.  What has attracted me to other cases was a suspect, whether parent, lover, bizarre details about the people involved, criminal info about people surroundin­g the missing person, etc.  With that said, I am now going to look for more info about this girl and the circumstan­ces.  
One thing that jumps out is she is a foster child (obviously it jumps out, I'm pointing out the obvious here).  There's often lots of drama around these poor kids who may have hopped from home to home. Before anyone takes that the wrong way, I have  no hidden meanings here.  I know some people who have been in the foster system, and that fact alone changes everything­.   
Now if the article stated something to the effect of strange statements by the parent/s or neighbors (anyone at all), we might have more to say on this.  
I say if you see this article, log in and comment even when there isn't much to speculate on in the article, just to show you still care that someone is missing.  I will try to keep up on this.  I am afraid to write in paragraphs because sometimes comments don't go through based on odd rules like spacing between sentences-­-so I've been told.

				ok, I can't find anything additional so far.  Why do they keep saying she "went to play"?  She is 16 right?  16 y.o.s don't go out to 'play'.  All kinds of articles have that phrase.  I found the Laurens sheriff dept facebook that also didn't have any additional info concerning Keyundra.  I can't find her personal facebook page if it exists.  Do you know how many 'Crystal Petersons' there are?  Can't narrow her down either.  One aricle did say she left with friends--i­s it left with, or went to meet?  If they came to her house to get her, I would think CP would've seen them.

				Maybe she is a runaway. I would rather read she took off on her own than something far worse happen to her. She came from a foster home, they should look there first. Foster parents are often not what they appear to the authoritie­s, they hide it well.  I hope she is found soon.

				Are you even kidding me? What a thoughtles­s and frankly idiotic statement to have made. Grown men are killed every day, and they are typically much stronger than women. Just because a girl weighs more than what is considered average does not give her superhuman strength or make her any more capable of fighting off an attack than a girl half her weight.

Sheesh.

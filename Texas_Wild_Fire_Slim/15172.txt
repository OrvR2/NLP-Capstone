Learning Liberty - South Korea

Order: Reorder

Author: journeymanpictures


The number of defectors entering South Korea from the North continues to grow, but escape from the regime is only the start of their battle for a better life. Can they adjust to life in the modern peninsula? A school has been set up to help the defectors adjust to their new life despite opposition from local residents who saw "communists as having horns or being scary", or indeed being "criminals". As the principal of the school says "everything is a challenge", from physical ailments caused by famine to having to "unlearn" a lifetime's worth of indoctrination. Many fled because the famine proved too much to bear. Around 80% have seen close relatives starve. The school does what it can to help these people adjust but the "culture shock" as the school's Director describes it, is "vast". We can only hope that having survived the famine, they can now survive their free and competitive new home. Produced By SBS Distributed By Journeyman Pictures

2000 homes are currently hooked up to a pilot project on the island of Jeju, South Korea, testing a new type of electricity supply system, called a smart grid. Lim Kee-Chu, whose home is hooked up to the system, has had $20000 worth of solar power technology installed. The South Korean plan calls for at least three city grids to go 'smart' by 2013, and for 10 per cent of energy to come from renewable sources by 2020. Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett reports from the South Korean island.

When grocery chain Tesco wanted to expand their market share in South Korea, they came up with a brilliant idea. Because the people in South Korea work long hours they thought of an efficient way to sell their products. The Korean subsidiary Home Plus put up billboards in subway stations with their range of products, accompanied by QR, or Quick Response codes. All people had to do now is scan the QR codes with their cell phone and the groceries were delivered to their doorsteps.

SOUTH KOREA buries alive three million pigs: Screams of terror & pain

Author: AgainstCruelty1


SIGN PETITION HERE AND SHARE! www.change.org Three million pigs are now quiet-in the earth, buried alive-suffocated to death. Their screams of terror and agony should never be forgotten. January and February 2011-due to Hoof-and-mouth disease (which can result from farm factory practices), South Korea kills 20% of their entire livestock-more than three million, most of them pigs--by burying them alive. Pigs are three times smarter than dogs. Their suffering should never be forgotten. If you say you love animals-then why do you eat them? America farm factory practices are just as cruel-USA animals are kept in cages often too small to move around; eating, drinking, sleeping in their own excrement and urine; ammonia fumes burn their lungs from the stench, kept alive with daily doses of antibiotics which gave rise to highly contiguous super bugs (bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics such as MRSA and VRE). The stress level of these animals weakens their immune systems also giving rise to viral epidemics including H1N1 (notice how the government wishes to disguise the term "SWINE flu" with H1N1 so people will continue to buy the meat), bird flu, etc. USA kills farm factory animals just as cruel even without the presence of such diseases (or at least not diagnosed-they are often killed before becoming symptomatic). Yet that never stops people from buying meat. Every meat buying patron is guilt of this sort of animal cruelty. If you say you love animals-YOU DO NOT EAT THEM.

South Korean Police Close In on Striking Autoworkers

Author: NTDTV


South Korean riot police clash with workers on strike at Ssangyong Motor on Wednesday (August 5). The protest and occupation of company buildings has been ongoing for more than two months. Around 600 laid-off workers have occupied the main factory of Ssangyong Motor for over 70 days. South Korean police descended on the autoworkers in full riot gear on Wednesday the 5th in an operation to break up a sit-in by unionists demanding to keep their jobs. Police commandos dropped tear gas bombs from helicopters and fired water cannons at the protesters before descending onto the roofs at the companys assembly plant in Pyeongtaek. Water supplies to the buildings in which the workers have blockaded themselves have been cut off. Most of the plant's facilities are now under police control except the main paint warehouse. Strikers are blockading the warehouse doors armed with blowtorches. Ssangyong's union has demanded government funds to rescue the troubled motor company, but the government has rejected the proposal. Analysts say that worries about the company's liquidation outweigh earlier hopes it may be revived. The Seoul Central District Court has ordered Ssangyong to draw up a survival plan by mid-September.

I heard he went to Art High School, but he could barely graduate because of his financial problem. I bet he couldn't get private lessons or support for his vocal training.. I admire him even more!!!!!!!!!! I seriously cried when he started singing.. just wanna give him a Huge Hug!! Bring it on Sung-bong!!! :) ** "Manual Worker": People laugh when Sung-bong said "manual worker" because the way he said was kinda slang.. (I couldn't find the right slang in English for that word) People were not laughing at him being a manual worker, but because of his word choice. I hope there's no misunderstanding here :) Here's one way you can support Sung-bong!! :) www.facebook.com

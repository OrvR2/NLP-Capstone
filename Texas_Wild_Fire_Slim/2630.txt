 San Francisco News






Another year, another successful stint in the desert. 
San Francisco became a decidedly quieter city this past week, as more than 50,000 burners from all walks of life spent seven transcendent days in Nevada's most famous pop-up utopia. Sold out for the first time in the event's 25-year history, the playa burst at the seams with everything from dinosaur-clad cars to geodesic alien installations.
Take a look at some of the snapshots from the festivities below, and be sure to submit your own if you have them. In the mean time, we'll see you in Black Rock City next year -- and at every decompression drum circle/precompression party/Burning Man Project fundraiser in between.
 




+ Add a slide
        

			We want to see your best Burning Man pictures!		
Capture some great images on the Playa last week? Upload them below for a chance to be featured on HuffPost.

				To all the haters here, what you may not "get" about Burningman and its meaning...­. It's about art. Plain and simple. Actual art. The art of community. The art of being part of a tribe. The art of living away from the comforts of modern day society. But mainly, art.

Art.

It's a big Art exhibit. It's BYO Art.

Art. Get it?

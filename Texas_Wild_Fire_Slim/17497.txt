Typical Libtards. And they say it is the "Tea Party Hobbit, Bagger, Bible Thumping, Gun Toting Terrorists".  
They just don't get it. Not now, not ever.


Tyler520   September 7th, 2011 - 1:32 pm

Typical Leftist fascism on display, yet again. 
These people are Obama's Brown Shirts, and the Tea Party has become Obama's Jews


BillyDKidd   September 7th, 2011 - 1:32 pm

I hope this does not pave the way for Tea Party arrests.


Geldistgut   September 7th, 2011 - 1:33 pm

The same guys also believe the moon landing was fake, W brought down the towers, and Obama is fixing the economy.


LostinOregon   September 7th, 2011 - 1:34 pm

Finally! About time these lefties got what is their due…..


JoeDoakes101   September 7th, 2011 - 1:35 pm

They have he-res pictures up at NASA now . . .


reversejihadist   September 7th, 2011 - 1:35 pm

Look for the union label! 
Thuggery, thy name is union.


Holdmynose   September 7th, 2011 - 1:35 pm

They've been practicing this all summer.  When the snow comes they will burrow back underground.


EOD   September 7th, 2011 - 1:36 pm

Damn subhuman savages.
Liberals are really starting to show their true colors.


RightUnite   September 7th, 2011 - 1:38 pm

And WHY would this pave the way for Tea Party arrests?


Cowboy Logic   September 7th, 2011 - 1:39 pm

Time to take those sons of a bitches out!

Detroit, Michigan.   
I wonder.
Those liberal folks protesting outside of Paul Ryans office?   
Would it be consider excessive, if I went to the time and trouble to pull a horse trailer there, unload my horse, swing a wide loop and rope one or two of those folks, just to teach them some manners?   
They would have the surprise of their life when that loop settled over their shoulders, and I dallied off and started spurring in the opposite direction.   
Paul Revere, meets the city folk………


Small Thoughts   September 7th, 2011 - 1:39 pm

It's funny that you never hear of conservatives disrupting events, throwing pies, making illegal street demonstrations, etc. It's always leftists. Beware if they ever get complete power.


Doobin   September 7th, 2011 - 1:39 pm

Do you really think those liber'cheese heads would take a job if it were offered to them?


spaceracer423   September 7th, 2011 - 1:40 pm

Ahhh 'Liberal" protesters.  
They always know just how many people you can fit on a short bus.  
Need a few "Liberal" protesters for your event?  
Simply stand in front of a bus in any city with a population over 100,000 with a sign that says:
"Free candy and weed inside."


MR2   September 7th, 2011 - 1:42 pm

Gen. Hoffa the Lessor has sent forth his Army to do Obama's bidding.


RedDogLindsay   September 7th, 2011 - 1:44 pm

Communists must go down, they must go down hard.


Flayer   September 7th, 2011 - 1:45 pm

Looked like the protesters were all white. They must be racists.


Flayer   September 7th, 2011 - 1:47 pm

Correction: OLD, white people protesting. I thought that was supposed to be the tea party…hmmm?


shaggatha   September 7th, 2011 - 1:47 pm

Those Wisconsin agitators were fed propaganda along with their sandwiches and coffee by Karleton Armstrong, the domestic terrorist forerunner to Timothy McVeigh. He's the one they don't want to mention by name when they insist that not all terrorists are islamists. They say, "McVeigh and guys like that."  He is as cold-blooded today as he ever was and he has a proven capability to do deadly violence.


EddieGin   September 7th, 2011 - 1:47 pm

Yes, this is going to get UGLY, I've been on the "Code-Pink" websites and the Home-moes sites they are coming for US big time. They really do want a war. They are going to use Race/Money and the Have-nots" to try and intimidate us.


GobBluth   September 7th, 2011 - 1:47 pm

I  remember  Tea Party people disrupting town hall meetings during the health care debate.  And good for them!  It's a free country—I'll be scared when no one is disrupting anything.


Deusexmachina   September 7th, 2011 - 1:47 pm

It would be kind of a drag…. 
Too bad, they don't have cactus in that part of the country….


BillyDKidd   September 7th, 2011 - 1:49 pm

Remember you are dealing with the twisted minds of Dims. They will put in plants to shout obscenities and such at ligit TP protests which will result in a bunch of innocent people being arrested. I see scenes like this as paving the way to oppose legitimate decent. This is how they work.


RedDogLindsay   September 7th, 2011 - 1:49 pm

Don't you dare touch his Taxpayer funded cheese. That is the picture of the ideal Leninist drone: the middle aged white man terrified of losing his government cheese. It doesn't get any better for the Left. Their work is done.


jleinf   September 7th, 2011 - 1:50 pm

They must be protesting the fact that wisconsin has gone from a deficit to a surplus under GOP control. Must be Libtards.


Boxhawker   September 7th, 2011 - 1:50 pm

Liberal tolerance on display.


WorldclaZZ   September 7th, 2011 - 1:51 pm

All of the protesters looked as if there was no shortage of food stamps.


Cowboy Logic   September 7th, 2011 - 1:54 pm

I could get into it.
It would be more fun than roping wild hogs.


MrRight   September 7th, 2011 - 1:54 pm

Hey let them run their mouth's. My advice is to keep ones powder dry for now. The thick of the election is still a ways off.


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 1:58 pm

Actually, two of the three arrested are unemployed republicans fed up with Ryan's unwillingness to pay attention to the need for job creation.


scovellj   September 7th, 2011 - 2:03 pm

Its not about Republicans son. When are you people going to get that through your head? Get a clue.


JustSayNoNow   September 7th, 2011 - 2:03 pm

Ignore them.  Their opinion no longer matters.  We're in charge now.


nceeno   September 7th, 2011 - 2:03 pm

"Where are the jobs?"  Are you kidding me?  How many plans do you have to come up with that liberals hate and call DOA?
Libtards. 
That fat headed guy made no sense either.


scovellj   September 7th, 2011 - 2:03 pm

Dozens of protesters? Maybe A dozen but with a cowbell. LOL!


JustSayNoNow   September 7th, 2011 - 2:04 pm

If these were 'actual' concerned citizens, they would be asking the guy that's been in office for almost 3 years – and who created this economic mess.  Obama!


TheIkonoklast   September 7th, 2011 - 2:05 pm

Here's what happens to Donkey plants at Tea Party events.

TheIkonoklast   September 7th, 2011 - 2:08 pm

Let em come–watch out for the rocks in their handbads.


TheIkonoklast   September 7th, 2011 - 2:10 pm

And again,  notice they all had commercially printed signs.  Yeah, no astroturfing here.


4arepublic   September 7th, 2011 - 2:11 pm

I volunteer to help "convert" them into steers.


DarthShatner   September 7th, 2011 - 2:11 pm

throwing pies or other objects, charging the official with fluids, and glittering is not disrupting debate, it's assault.


WVSickFreak   September 7th, 2011 - 2:11 pm

Was that Michael Moore in the video around 0:48 mark? Or was it just an unfortunate look a like?


Trickle_Up_Poverty   September 7th, 2011 - 2:11 pm

They are all union thugs.


SquidVicious   September 7th, 2011 - 2:11 pm

"I PAID MY MONEY!!!".  
By paying your money do you mean your right to honor the PRIVATE speaking forum conducted?  
Or, by paying your money do you mean your delusions of grandeur to act like a 10 year old in need of Ritalin?


Cowboy Logic   September 7th, 2011 - 2:13 pm

We could do that, but with one caveat. 
For the first time in my life, I'll pass on the calf-fries.


Trickle_Up_Poverty   September 7th, 2011 - 2:15 pm

Paul Ryan is a smart, capable man…an anathema to liberals.  He now has a target on his forehead.


wohlfguy   September 7th, 2011 - 2:16 pm

Actually your posts prove that liberalism is a mental disorder.  Now I know why all you mental midgets wanted Obamacare so badly…therapy for life paid by people that actually pay taxes.


4arepublic   September 7th, 2011 - 2:21 pm

We could send those delicacies to Ed Schultze, it would probably only be an appetizer sized portion. Those Marxists don't have much in the way of cajones.


RandomOrder   September 7th, 2011 - 2:21 pm

Governments don't create jobs…..Oh nevermind……your a lefty…..you don't understand the premise…..


vivlibomuori   September 7th, 2011 - 2:22 pm

*shudder*


vivlibomuori   September 7th, 2011 - 2:23 pm

Wanting their elected officials to answer their questions is not disrupting the debate. It IS the debate.


DonaldDuck   September 7th, 2011 - 2:25 pm

Yeah quailman, spoken like a true progressive. I bet they can't wait to hear what Dick Obama has to say tomorrow nite about his job creation plan. Should be real inspirational and enlightening.


Cowboy Logic   September 7th, 2011 - 2:26 pm

Yep.


Cowboy Logic   September 7th, 2011 - 2:26 pm

………and double yep. 
Love your new avitar.
Tome to get ready for the high point of my day.
The Right Reverend Alphonse………


ToddM   September 7th, 2011 - 2:27 pm

How do these people get near the place? You should be able to smell them a mile away.


DarthShatner   September 7th, 2011 - 2:27 pm

exactly… the elected official is in the town hall to answer questions.. the people control the dialogue.  
It's really sad that the democrat party has changed the concept of public servent into public master.  
If we only did exactly what Obama wanted, everything would be gravy.


ToddM   September 7th, 2011 - 2:30 pm

Ryan's been there putting out plans. Where's Obama been other than golfing, vacationing, watching TV, etc.? Where have his plans been? He has a jobs speech once a year. Soon it'll be on the calendar with other holidays.


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 2:30 pm

But Rick Perry claims to have created a lot of jobs, and in fact 40% of the jobs created under Little Richard are in the public sector!


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 2:31 pm

I'm quite sure I pay more in taxes annually than you make. Heck, my property taxes are more than your salary, I'd bet.


Deusexmachina   September 7th, 2011 - 2:33 pm

Yup, a moonbat round-up… 
Don't forget to brand them with a big 'O'….


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 2:34 pm

Only commies watch Presidential speeches. I'll be watching the Packers while you sickos twist yourselves in knots rooting for Joe Wilson to pop a vein again..


ayejoel   September 7th, 2011 - 2:34 pm

You should be a patriot and pay more like a good little liberal.


ayejoel   September 7th, 2011 - 2:34 pm

Which would be 60% in the private sector. What's your point boy.


pistons4ever   September 7th, 2011 - 2:46 pm

2 bus loads of Illinois protesters ( observed in parking area near event). -news item. The left has declared a full blown war on the anyone not in agreement / submission to their program. The last thing that conservatives need is another Neville Chamberlain as a republican president to think you can make peace with this leftist insanity. Thank you Democrats, anarchy once started rarely ends. Thanks Big labor for learning from Henry Ford who brought in criminals to break strikes . now big labor uses thugs to push it's agenda (see Wisconsin 2011). Some improvement!


DarthShatner   September 7th, 2011 - 2:49 pm

let me guess… in 23 minutes you'll hop in your european sport sedan and take off to the gym for a quick abs workout then hurry home to your super model wife so that you can take her out for a steak and lobster dinner at the most trendy night spot in town. 
DOOOOSHBAG!


DarthShatner   September 7th, 2011 - 2:50 pm

BAM!


wohlfguy   September 7th, 2011 - 2:52 pm

I'll take that bet jackass.  Post last years W2 or STFU and go back to the unempoyment line.


wohlfguy   September 7th, 2011 - 2:54 pm

And Obama has lost millions!!


TANSTAAFL   September 7th, 2011 - 3:01 pm

Smell the panic.


TANSTAAFL   September 7th, 2011 - 3:02 pm

You're not very intelligent, are you?


TANSTAAFL   September 7th, 2011 - 3:02 pm

And a liar, too.


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 3:03 pm

No, my custom leather and walnut trim interior, 5 speed manual transmission Volvo wagon will stay in the driveway while my wife (who was captain of her Catholic high school cheerleading squad) goes to back to school night. I'll be here making homemade chicken and pineapple pizzas with fresh green peppers and tomatoes from my organic garden, in case you need to know.


TANSTAAFL   September 7th, 2011 - 3:03 pm

Lie.


alwaysright5   September 7th, 2011 - 3:04 pm

You are a lying sack of excrement, those maggots looked like typical liberal scum in desperate need of a shower.


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 3:04 pm

My accountant has all tax related documents, and they won't be posted here.


TANSTAAFL   September 7th, 2011 - 3:04 pm

Thank you for proving my point about your intelligence.


wohlfguy   September 7th, 2011 - 3:07 pm

I figured that you were full of sh*t. My accountant gives me a copy of all my tax related documents plus I always make a copy before meeting with them.. If I were you I would call H&R Block and demand your copy. Faxing you your 1 page return should not take long.


alwaysright5   September 7th, 2011 - 3:09 pm

Dammit! No skulls were cracked?


susandiane311   September 7th, 2011 - 3:10 pm

What, no "Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho, Congressman Ryan has got to go!" ?


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 3:30 pm

H&R Block are plumbers. My accountant has a law degree as well. I have electronic access to my records 24/7, and you won't see BUPKIS!


clarityinla   September 7th, 2011 - 3:34 pm

The Left has no class.


democratsarefools   September 7th, 2011 - 3:35 pm

Ryan has put his ideas on the table and his ideas do not even take money from you. Now you are free to take some more that you do not pay for.


newamerica   September 7th, 2011 - 3:39 pm

old fat boy who said " congressman ryan is inexcessable !" looks like he hasent missed a meal from the collapes of the economy. makes you wonder how long he has been at the pig trough sucking up the swill of tax dollars?


Wsorrian   September 7th, 2011 - 3:45 pm

We didn't and it's still a lie no matter how many times you tell it.


wohlfguy   September 7th, 2011 - 3:48 pm

Plumbers?   
Again, I knew you were full of sh*t.  But keep up the happy thoughts about your imaginary wealth!


wohlfguy   September 7th, 2011 - 3:55 pm

Once again you prove to be full of sh*t. Don't make bets you can't backup.Sent from my iPhone


DonaldDuck   September 7th, 2011 - 3:59 pm

If you think for one nanosecond that conservatives/ Tea Partiers will be watching Dick Obama tomorrow nite, you are really, really  in bad shape! We, like you, will be watching something meaningful; the f.b. game. And Joe Wilson, thanks to Jimmy Baby, will not call him a liar. He can call him a son-of-a-bitch and your progressives will not be able to complain. You know, its all part of the "new civility" advanced by the lefties. But, of course, they will whine like little girly men because only progs can talk that way.


di_da_is_alpha   September 7th, 2011 - 4:07 pm

That's what I thought.   Seems he's an unfortunate 'think alike' too.


Quayle2012_KNOT   September 7th, 2011 - 4:13 pm

I'm sure H&R Block is fine for your needs.


wohlfguy   September 7th, 2011 - 4:17 pm

Project much?


cothel   September 7th, 2011 - 4:21 pm

Ryan is done after next year. The people of Wisconsin have had enough of his nonsense.


Heebsy   September 7th, 2011 - 4:23 pm

Silly socialists.  Must have taken Maxine Waters Economics course before they dropped out of high school.  Ryan for President!!!


Heebsy   September 7th, 2011 - 4:27 pm

Karleton Armstrong?  Is that murderer still around?  Last I heard he was running a sandwich shop.


Heebsy   September 7th, 2011 - 4:33 pm

It appeared that one "worker" hasn't missed a meal because of Walker and Ryan's policies.


blevit   September 7th, 2011 - 5:26 pm

I HATE liberals…They're human garbage


fliteking   September 7th, 2011 - 5:30 pm

I've never seen a better moronic display than the chanting / cheerleading these damn fools start doing the minute a camera is on them .


Sound&Fury   September 7th, 2011 - 5:38 pm

To be consistent, the law should treat them just as they treat protesters outside abortion clinics.


Mimatt   September 7th, 2011 - 5:44 pm

Lets start charging them with felonies so they lose their right to vote.


winstonlabrador   September 7th, 2011 - 5:48 pm

Do you buy the chicken at Whole Foods, or do they run around in your back yard?  What about the pineapple–is it homemade like the chicken or canned?


Libs_Rule   September 7th, 2011 - 5:51 pm

Yup, you conservatives are sooooo polite.  Just read some of the posts here.  Real classy bunch.  So STFU, stupid confederate flag moron.


Indiepalin   September 7th, 2011 - 5:53 pm

Someone switched the footage:  this was shot at a Town Hall meeting during the summer of 2009.

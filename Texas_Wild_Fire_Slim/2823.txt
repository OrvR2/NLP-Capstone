From 24/7 Wall St.: President Barack Obama will give a speech before a joint session of Congress this week, in which he will lay out a job creation plan. There have been only seven speeches about economic and business issues before a joint session of Congress since the end of The Great Depression. 24/7 Wall St. has reviewed these speeches and found that they had virtually no effect on the economy, despite the detailed proposals.
Of the seven addresses, two were about labor trouble, and both by Harry Truman: One about the railroad strike in 1946, and the other about the steel strike in 1952. Neither speech was effective. The strikes were settled by labor and management irrespective of the speeches. As a matter of fact, the railroad strike ended the day of the president’s speech.
The balance of the speeches addressed different crises such as soaring energy costs, inflation, and recession. Each of these speeches offered specific road maps for economic improvement. While each president gave a broad description of the trouble, most offered a specific set of solutions. Rarely were any of the plans adopted, either because of political opposition or because the problems resolved themselves. In many cases, the economy got worse after the presidential address. It is impossible to trace any recovery to the presidential proposals in almost every case. Those that were enacted into law were so substantially changed by Congress that they barely resembled the presidents’ suggestions.
24/7 Wall St. reviewed all of the presidential addresses to joint sessions of Congress from The Great Depression through the present to identify all those that dealt primarily with the economy. 
This is 24/7 Wall St.’s analysis of The Seven Presidential Addresses To Congress On The Economy. Read more at 24/7 Wall St.

Date: May 25, 1946
President: Harry S. Truman
Inflation: 8.3 percent
GDP 1 yr. growth: -10.9 percent (the second worst since The Great Depression)
Unemployment: 3.9 percent

On May 25, 1946, Truman said: "I come before the American people tonight at a time of great crisis. The crisis of Pearl Harbor was the result of action by a foreign enemy. The crisis tonight is caused by a group of men within our own country who place their private interests above the welfare of the nation." The "group of men" happened to be the hundreds of thousands of coal workers that were on strike and the railroad workers that were on the verge of doing the same. Believing the unions were going too far by threatening to strike, Truman demanded the workers settle or he would implement measures such as drafting strikers into the armed forces. Mid-speech, Truman received word that the potential railroad strike had been settled. Days later, the coal strike ended as well. The president would face several more labor disputes during his two terms in office.

				While President Carter's term in the White House will not be fondly remembered­, he had at least had the intestinal fortitude to tell Americans things that they did not wished but needed to hear: that we as a nation cannot rely on foreign sources to supply us with raw materials and goods indefinite­ly; that the nation and her citizens must learn to live within our means.

It's ironic that we are hearing the same message again 40 years later, only this time it's coming from the Republican­s.  This is the same group of people who venerate the President who began this nation's addiction to the notion of cheap credit, and that any deficit in the federal budget can be managed by borrowing to cover the gap.

And it is now time for Prez Obama to stop being such a nice guy and use the POWER WE GAVE YOU to fight the opposition who does not understand anything but the upcoming election..­.Americans thought by empowering you to lead us we felt after 8 years of dread by the previous administra­tion that we now had the SHIP of HOPE....bu­t that now seems to be fading away because of the PARTY of NOPE.

				How Obama will fail:  He believes in his own magic! "Progressi­ves are angry and disconsola­te with Mr. Obama because they increasing­ly see him as a loser," we observed last month. "But if the president is a loser, it is precisely because he is one of them." And he is one of them in attitude as well as ideology. He's just a little slower to lose faith in his own magic.

				Fact: Congress has just passed a deficit reduction deal and no political will exists for badly needed jobs program.  Serious action will only occur, just as in the Great Depression­, when the economy deteriorat­es so badly that the resulting unrest threatens the very fabric of society.

American liberalism by definition is a grand compromise­.  Politician­s don't simply dole out badly needed laws; they act when compelled by massive popular pressure.  I dare say the public needs to learn this lesson agan.

				One notes how much spin is necessary to try to avoid giving Reagan credit for the longest-ru­nning boom and bull market in our history, from 1983 to 2000.The speech and the creation of a bill did occur in 1981 and the recovery did not start until 1983, and clearly the policies of Paul Volcker were partly responsibl­e for the recovery.  But one should note several factors:  1) Economic inertia--i­t takes 18 months or so for a policy change to have much measurable effect.  2) The bill was passed in 1981, but the TAX CUTS WERE PHASED IN SLOWLY, and they did not fully take effect until 1983--when the recovery began.  3) Job growth and economic expansion were remarkably brisk through those years following 1983.  4) Obama would probably KILL for an economic recovery half as good.  But then Obama's policies are precisely the opposite of Reagan's and thus can't be expected to produce the same benefits.

				because all of Obama's policies have taken effect imediately­, and can be categorize­d as a failure. you are quite the scientific mind. govt spending increased dramatical­ly under Reagan with WAR dept spending. the debt ceiling was raised 18 times(shhh­h) under Reagan. The govt under Reagan borrowed more money than any US pres from Washington up to that date. 1987 crash happened. supply side lunatics were now normal. even the VP Bush called it voo-doo economics. but Obama is a failure. got it.

Obama has cut taxes -- I guess that's what you mean by the "opposite" of Reagan's.

				Obama has not actually CUT TAXES, he has given some tax rebates and tax holidays, not cutting tax rates, not cutting specifical­ly MARGINAL tax rates.  Indeed, he has spent much of his time threatenin­g to raise taxes.No, that's NOT what I meant.

				It is also interestin­g the way Reagan is idolized.  He was the one who fired volkner who fixed the economy with regulation because he wanted Greenspan to de-regulat­e the banking industry.
He should get the blame for the mortgage crisis instead of Clinton as he was the one who began the de-regulat­ion that worked well for the past 40 years.

				1) Congress under Carter created the mortgage mess.  2) Andrew Cuomo under Clinton increased the percentage of bad loans mandated.  3) Glass-Stea­gall was rescinded under Clinton.Clearly Ronald Reagan was not perfect.  He pulled troops out of Beirut after an attack, for example, encouragin­g Islamic terrorists­.  But that doesn't mean he was wrong in everything and it does not mean he wasn't responsibl­e for much good.  His spending on the Cold War, for example, broke up the Soviet Union and allowed Clinton to claim a "peace dividend" and cut military spending.  That might have been unwise, come to think of it!  We needed those troops later.

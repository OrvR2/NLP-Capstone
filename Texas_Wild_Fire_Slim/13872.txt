(KTBS) - An 18-wheeler's flat tire sparked a massive fire in East Texas Sunday.
The fire started in Harrison County in the Scottsville area just before 2:00 p.m. Twenty engines from several different volunteer fire districts were called in to battle the blaze.
As of Sunday evening the blaze has claimed nearly 300 acres and swallowed at least two homes. Evacuations have been forced in several areas.
"We've evacuated Web Rogers Road, Ira Williams Road and a few other areas on the perimeter of the fire," said Harrison County Fire Marshall Thomas Mock.
"Until the weather improves, the threat of wildfire, dangerous life threatening will continue. I always like to say ladies and gentleman be careful, this could happen in your own backyard, take precautions and under no circumstances burn outdoors," said Harrison County Judge Hugh Taylor.
Fire officials say much of the fire is burning uncontained and that it is much larger than it was earlier in the day.
At least 30 homes have been evacuated so far. Officials did not say how long it might be before those residents would be allowed to return home.

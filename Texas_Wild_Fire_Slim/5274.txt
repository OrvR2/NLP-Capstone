"I was looking for something else and I come across this document saying 'Chanel is a Nazi agent, her number is blah, blah, blah and her pseudonym is Westminster.' I look at this again and I say, 'What the hell is this?' I couldn't believe my eyes!"
— Hal Vaughan, the 84-year-old historian and author, on stumbling upon documents in France's national police  archive alleging that Coco Chanel was a Nazi spy, a revelation that is included in his new book, "Sleeping with the Enemy: Coco Chanel's Secret Wars." The book also claims Chanel was a "fierce" anti-Semite.

Who cares! Obama is a marxist, does any american care anymore, hell no!  that's what;s wrong with our country.  nobody cares anymore because we all now have no motivation because of our fabulous leaders in this country do not lead.  they do not walk their talk but certainly take all the money from donors they can stuff in there shorts or bra's.  just ask charlie rangle ( tax evading congressman reelected after being found guilty) america is sick, really sick!

Let's not judge her too harshly, who knows maybe she liked the uniforms. Anyway we dont know what mad ideology this present generation may yet get drawn into. Who knows maybe Enimen may sing 'Die Fahne Hoch' yet. He has the right attitudes for it; Admires strength and respects violence, hates gays, thinks of women as #$%$ probably not that mad about Jews either. Him and a lot of his rap generation could easily fit into the SA, not the SS though, you had to be able to spell to get into them. Anyway they could splash on lots of Chanel Aftershave for Men (real men not #$%$ like me)

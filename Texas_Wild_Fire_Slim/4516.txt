2012 New Car PreviewFuel economy drives innovation.By Consumer Reports Staff | ConsumerReports.org – Thu, Sep 8, 2011 1:46 PM EDT





Rising oil prices and tougher fuel-economy requirements are the inspiration for the latest wave of fuel-saving vehicles. Prominent among them are more small cars, gas-electric hybrids, and electric cars. However, many larger mainstream vehicles are being tweaked to improve their gas mileage by more conventional means, such as innovations in turbocharging, weight reduction, aerodynamics, and direct fuel injection.MORE AT CONSUMERREPORTS.ORG» Most reliable cars» Complete Ratings for 200 cars and trucksConsumer Reports has no relationship with any advertisers on Yahoo!.Moreover, even the least expensive cars will have improved safety features, because federal laws now require antilock brakes and electronic stability control as standard equipment on all cars and light trucks. And backup cameras are becoming common, especially on SUVs, where they’re often needed the most.Here’s our take on some of the most notable new models.Audi A6Summer 2011The A6 redesign features lighter aluminum body panels and a direct-injection 310-hp 3.0-liter V6 mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission to help improve fuel economy. The base engine is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder good for 211 hp paired with a CVT. The front wheels have been moved farther forward, allowing for more cabin room, and the MMI driver-interaction system is said to be a bit easier to operate. Available gadgets include a color heads-up display, a night-vision display, and LED headlights.Bottom line: It’s significant that Audi and BMW are bringing four-cylinder engines to their elite sedans.Buick VeranoLate 2011The smallest Buick in decades is an entry-level sedan based on the Chevrolet Cruze. But it uses the same more powerful 177-hp four-cylinder engine and six-speed automatic transmission as the larger Regal. The Verano has a touch-screen navigation system and uses advanced sound-deadening techniques. Higher trims will offer a heated steering wheel and other plush features.Bottom line: This compact yet upscale Buick will be a welcome addition for consumers who want luxury features without going to a larger car.Chevrolet MalibuEarly 2012The Chevrolet Malibu’s redesign shares underpinnings with the Buick Regal, an agile and well-finished car that did quite well in our road tests. The new Malibu is a bit wider than before, but its wheelbase is about 4.5 inches shorter. The primary engine is a 190-hp four-cylinder, but a mild hybrid system called eAssist, Chevrolet claims, yields 26 mpg in the city and 38 on the highway.Bottom line: The Malibu will come up against some stiff competition in this segment from midsized stalwarts such as the Nissan Altima, Honda Accord, and Toyota Camry. But if the Malibu retains the Buick Regal’s ride, handling, and interior quality, it should become a strong competitor. Notably, the new Malibu won’t be offered with a V6 engine.Chevrolet SonicFall 2011The Korean-designed, U.S.-built Sonic is a serious attempt by General Motors to gain traction in the subcompact market now dominated by cars like the Honda Fit and Nissan Versa. A four-door hatch and sedan are available, as they were for the Aveo it replaces. They are both relatively roomy and are powered by the same engines used in the larger Chevrolet Cruze, a 1.8-liter four-cylinder or an optional turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder. The Sonic’s long list of safety features includes 10 air bags.Bottom line: Our early drives with a preproduction model last winter indicate that the Sonic is far more competitive than the Aveo.Hyundai AccentSummer 2011The redesigned Accent subcompact is available as a sedan or hatch. Its interior is relatively spacious and well finished. Its new 138-hp four-cylinder direct-injection engine gets an EPA estimated 30/40 (city/highway) mpg. Standard features include six air bags and active front head restraints but not cruise control. Both transmissions, an automatic and a manual, are six-speed.Bottom line: The Accent is about sound, affordable transportation. But the interior feels cheap, and the cabin is noisy.PaginationFirstPrevious12NextLast(2 Pages) | Read all

I just love Cadillacs, but will never buy another one as long as the UAW has ownership in the company.  Unions have no business having ownership in any business that it has members  that their rank and file work in.  Obama was a complete idiot in that respect or just about most of his ignorant decisions.  I will never buy another GM product as long as they (UAW) have ANY amount of ownership.  I am not totally anti union, but in general they have destroyed just about all companies that they are invoved with.  I believe in fair wages, but the fact is they have screwed almost all industries in this wonderful America.  Early on the unions were necessary, but went overboard with the power they achieved.  The UAW has caused more people to go to foreign cars more than any other reason because their greed has just about destroyed the American automobile's ability to compete with the oversea auto manufacturers.  There is not one employee including the executives that deserves the pay they receive along with their benefits and lack of pride in the products they build.  All you union members will take umbrage with this comment, but I don't care.  Your cost of living was raised because of the union greed for power and those who have to live on minimum wages, some who are your kinsmen, suffer because of your underserved greed.  We need unions, but we need laws to control unions greed for power.

Most intriguing 2012 car models?  Intriguing to whom? Martians?  The rest of us are trying to find or hold onto our JOBS.  What's more, if I had 40-thousand bucks to blow, it sure as heck wouldn't be on this overpriced plastic crap.  Tack on the price of fuel and insurance and what would be the monthly expense?  

Hell, I can squeeze 28MPG out of my old '72 Chevelle.  Insurance is another $35 per month.

Typical of liberal weenie Consumer Reports.  The first car listed is the A6 Audi with a 300hp V6 and 8 speed auto trans.  A better choice would be the new Chrysler 300S with 300hp V6 and same 8 speed auto trans.  The Chrysler is roomier, gets better fuel economy, is better looking and costs thousands less.  Best of all it has a better warranty and is made in America!

Never buy a car with aluminum body panels.  Aluminum will form an aluminum oxide coating which will cut off oxygen and prevent further corrosion.  If you get salt on aluminum, the coating will no longer keep oxygen out.  The aluminum panels will corrode ten times faster than steel if exposed to salt.  The salt can come from either winter driving or the ocean.  They usually spray a coating on aluminum, but it wears off quickly.

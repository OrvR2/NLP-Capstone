From Inhabitat:
Anonymous artist group LuzInterruptus rattled the crowds at Hamburg's Dockville Festival with a haunting installation that reminds us of the dangers of nuclear power. The Spanish collective is known for creating guerilla LED light installations throughout the streets of Madrid that they call "interventions." Their work often features slightly illuminated everyday materials and figures that would otherwise go unnoticed.

				Cool, the little lights of radioactiv­e decay causing cancer from nuclear power.  

Green energy already cheaper, forever, faster to install, safe and clean.  Rooftop pv solar, offshore wind and waste biochar bio fuels will supply all the energy the world needs for a first world living standard.  

panels lasting longer and better than predicted http://sol­ar.gwu.edu­/Research/­EnergyPoli­cy_Zweibel­2010.pdf   Great article about price of solar now 3$/W installed.  last 100 years, 1-2 cents pwer KWH after the first 20 years and the loan is paid off.

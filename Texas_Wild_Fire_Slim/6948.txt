Dione Simmons and Mikayla Barry of Girl Scout Troop 9449 recently completed four stained glass panels for their Gold Award Projects, which were presented to the elementary campus of St. Joseph Catholic School and blessed by the Rev. Msgr. John McCaffrey. 
The four panels represent the four gospels -- Matthew, Mark, Luke and John -- and were decorated with a purple and gold border to represent the school's colors. They contain gold glass from the original stained glass at St. Joseph Catholic Church. 
The Gospel of Matthew was symbolized by a winged man in order to emphasize Christ's humanity as the promised Messiah; the Gospel of Mark was represented by a  winged lion, which is a symbol of royalty and courage; the Gospel of Luke was depicted by a winged ox, which represents Christ's willingness to sacrifice and serve; and the Gospel of John was represented by an eagle, representing the divinity of Christ. 
St. Joseph Catholic Church, the Usher's Club, the Women's Guild and the Knights of Columbus Council No. 11759 sponsored the project. In-kind donations were made by Mrs. Edna Taylor, We-Rent-It and Awards and More.

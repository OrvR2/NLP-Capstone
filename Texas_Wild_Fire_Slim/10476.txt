HURRICANE RITA FOREST RECOVERY TASK FORCE UPDATE DEC 21, 2005









[ Print | 

 ]



On October 5, nearly 50 individuals interested in facilitating the Hurricane Rita forest recovery efforts met in Lufkin to discuss issues and begin implementation of the recovery process. The Task Force established a template for action, including seven teams with specific goals.
The first Task Force Team Update was produced on October 27, 2005. Following is an update as of December 21, 2005.
Logging Team – Paul Hale – TLC Coordinator, 903/728-5738, hale.p@worldnet.att.net
Goals:
• Coordinate and develop a list of logging contractors involved in salvage efforts
• Monitor and report on safety and hazard issue
• Monitor and report on any issues preventing the movement of logs and debris
Report/Accomplishments:
• A list of loggers with contact information is still being maintained on the TFA web site. So far, we are fortunate in that there have been no serious accidents resulting from hurricane salvage work.
• Logging capacity continues to be affected by loggers working in other states on recovery from previous hurricanes, loggers working on FEMA clean-up, and company contractors working on fee lands. Smaller acreage landowners who wish to sell dead and down trees only may have a hard time hooking up with a logger. Cut and haul rates have increased by at least 1/3 due to fuel, transportation, inefficiencies in salvage work, and reduced production. Many landowners may be reluctant to salvage their timber if it means including a significant portion of green timber at current stumpage prices.

Forest Landowner Team – Gene Meyers, 936/544-4803, gmeyers@intrastar.net
Goals:
• Report on the salvage operations on private lands
• Identify disaster assistance needs at the federal and state levels
• Report on reforestation needs
Report/Accomplishments:
• The main challenges from a landowner perspective seem to be a shortage of logging capacity and prices so low that some landowners are refusing to sell. Weather is dry enough that logging is going very well. While markets are slightly limited, there doesn’t appear to be anything too restrictive, especially considering the dry weather. Prime salvage logs are going from $5/ton to $20/ton stumpage. Pine pulpwood salvage stumpage is going from $1 to $3/ton. The low prices aren’t so much that mills have lowered their prices but more that logging costs have increased $10 to $20/ton due to salvage expense. Landowners who had a relationship with a company or a logger or a managed their timber through a consulting forester seem to be moving their timber pretty well. In general the situation appears to be not as bad as I thought it would be.

Wood Utilization Team – Burl Carraway, 979/458-6630, bcarraway@tfs.tamu.edu
Goals:
• Identify and minimize impediments to the utilization of salvaged wood
• Report on markets for salvaged material
• Monitor and report on the quality of salvaged wood
• Salvage 40 percent of damaged timber
Report/Accomplishments:
• Texas Forest Service conducted an informal telephone survey to 32 mills in the Southeast Texas/Western Louisiana area and asked each mill to estimate the amount of salvage material it has received as of December 12. Data were received for all salvage material, pine logs, mixed logs, pine logs, and mixed pulpwood.
Total Salvage Pine saw logs Mixed saw logs Pine pulpwood Mixed pulpwood
Weight (Tons) 667,764 289,372 106,004 217,716 54,701
Percentage (%) 43 16 33 8
• Converting the 667,764 tons of total salvage to cubic feet works out to 20.3 million cubic feet, as reported by the contacted mills.

Communication Team –Susan Stutts, co-chair, 936/632-8733, sstutts@texasforestry.org
Marilynn Grossman, co-chair, 979/458-6606, mgrossman@tfs.tamu.edu
Goals:
• Coordinate contacts with media
• Provide updates on salvage operation.
• Perform outreach & education to address landowner’s questions about salvage operations
Report/Accomplishments:

Notable media coverage:
• House considers hurricane relief for East Texas counties, Suzanne Gamboa, Associated Press, December 8, 2005
• Timber industry tries to recover after hurricanes, Steve Quinn, Associated Press business writer, November 18, 2005 (extensive coverage)
• KBTV-TV Channel 4, Beaumont: Interview with Ron Hufford
• Timber Talk: 30-minute radio interview reaching landowners in South Arkansas, Northeast Texas and North Louisiana; Live broadcast December 8, 2005.
• An article in the December issue of The Piney Woods Journal ran about Tom Boggus's report at the TFA Annual Meeting. This paper services Louisiana and East Texas; circulation is about 15,000.
Presentations/Outreach:
• Texas Forest Landowners Council – October and December
• Texas Forestry Association annual meeting – Nov. 16-18: Hurricane Rita forest recovery and landowner assistance overview by Tom Boggus; Tax implications for hurricane damaged timber by Trey Cousins
• The October, November and December issues of Texas Forestry feature several related articles for forest landowners.

Governmental Affairs Team – James Houser, 903/568-9375, jhouser@jameshouser.net
Goals:
• Coordinate needs with local, state, and federal agencies
• Coordinate requests for expedited permit variances for air, water, and transportation issues
• Serve as liaison with state agencies, governor’s office, and elected officials
Report/Accomplishments:
• Transportation: Worked with the Governor’s Staff and TxDOT to ensure that the motor carrier waiver was extended. The extended waiver is based on the motor carrier waiver in Louisiana and Florida and is in effect until January 15, 2006. TFS is studying the progress of the recovery efforts and the need to request another extension to the motor carrier waiver. No problems have been identified with regard to road damage or hauling problems.
• Air & Water: Assisted in some initial work with TCEQ regarding water permits for wet decks. Since that time no other problems have been reported.
• Public Officials: Assisted Congressman Brady’s office with the needs assessment for Hurricane recovery efforts. Congressman Brady is co-authoring legislation with Congressman McCrey of Louisiana, to provide assistance to private landowners with their recovery efforts. The legislation is referred to as The Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 – HR 4440. The Senate passed similar provisions on 11/18/05 in S 2020. HB 4440 increases expensing and net operating loss carryback for qualified timber property. The proposal raises the limit to $20,000 and allows losses to be carried back for 5-years rather than the current 2-year carryback. The proposal only applies to taxpayers owing less than 500 acres of timber in the storm damaged counties. HR 4440 passed the House of Representatives on Friday, 12/9/05 by a vote of 415-4. The legislation is now headed for the President’s signature.
• Congressman Brady is also working with USDA on a targeted agricultural assistance package for Hurricane relief. USDA is currently authorizing $250 million for crop disaster (to include trees) assistance. The distribution plan for these funds is still being finalized.
• The NRCS has announced that EQIP funds will be used to supplement EQIP county based funds and that the agency will leverage other state and Federal programs in the storm damaged counties.

Forest Health & Regeneration Team – Bill Oates, 936/875-4400, boates@tfs.tamu.edu
Goals:
• Monitor and report on danger for wildfire and insect infestations
• Identify needs for site preparation and planting
• Assess effectiveness and the need for federal and state incentives
Report/Accomplishments:
Issues of Concern
• Estimated NIPF acres damaged = 165,000
• Potential Insect and Disease Problems
• Reforestation and Site Preparation Needs
• Seedling Availability
• Economics and Cost-Sharing
Conclusions & Recommendations
• Joe Pase developed report addressing potential pest and forest health issues.
• Goal of a NIPF reforestation program – 100,000 acres
• Reforestation time-frame – 3 to 5 years
• Federal incentive program needs – 1) 75% cost-share (ala FLEP) or 2) CRP-like program with annual rental payments and a 50% cost-share.
• Estimated incentive program price tag – 30 to 50 million dollars
Possible Roadblocks
• Seedling supply – with the potential loss of the IP nurseries, seedlings available for this program will be an issue. TFS has some capacity to increase production, but with a potential need of 15 to 20 million per year, other sources will have to be developed.
• Vendors – much of the site preparation work will be heavy mechanical. A vendor force to meet the increased demand will have to be developed. Tree planting vendors will be less of a challenge.
• With Federal dollars already in short supply, availability of significant funds is questionable.
• TFS will need 2-3 additional foresters to provide technical assistance to NIPF landowners.
• Landowners in the affected areas have already sustained a substantial financial set-back; many will be unwilling to re-invest without significant incentives. Cost-shares may not be enough; may need to look at other avenues to encourage investment; state/local property tax considerations, significant income tax reductions, etc.

Biomass Team – Darwin Foster, 979/845-1351, cdfoster@tamu.edu
Goals:
• Identify co-firing/wood burning facilities
• Identify new, non-traditional markets for biomass
Report/Accomplishments:
• Most of the urban and rural debris is too contaminated, primarily with dirt, to be used for fuel.
• Each city/town handles the disposal of downed timber in different ways. Some are hauling it to a central location with the intention of burning it. However, burn bans have hindered that plan. Others (Lufkin for example) are chipping the debris to be used as mulch.
• Most of the production capability for salvage of rural timber is concentrated on industry land. The team was told by Tommy Burch that his crew is clear cutting hurricane damaged plantations that he thinned last year. As a result little effort is spent on nonindustrial forest landowner’s property.

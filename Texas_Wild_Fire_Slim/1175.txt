 Black Voices News






The web was abuzz today with news that Esquire Magazine named Rihanna its 2011 "Sexiest Women Alive." Not hard to believe, but not true. 
Steamy pictures and a video of the Barbadian babe rolling around naked and rubbing dirt over her body while on her first Esquire photo shoot were posted online but quickly removed. It was just enough time for rumors to start flying that Rihanna had captured the coveted 'sexiest' title.  
Though Rihanna was in the running, the honor went to Katrina Bowden who stars on NBC's 30 Rock and was just tapped as the new face (or body) of Jordache jeans company. 
Sure, Bowden is hot enough to resurract a line of outdated stone-washed jeans and her flat stomach makes us want to run to the gym, but it's hard to believe she could out sexy Rihanna. 
Take a look at Rhianna's sexiest looks this past year and you be the judge. 




Quick Poll

				Rihanna is probably the most over-rated celebrity of all time. Not that attractive and a less than mediocre voice. Big on hype, low on talent.

Texas A&M's VET gives pets a safe haven from wildfires

With a lot of livestock needing to be evacuated from the wildfire near Bastrop, Texas A&M's Veterinary Emergency Team was dispatched to the area to help.

It's normal for doctors to come to the aid of injured people in an emergency response and it's common for trained dogs to help in the search and rescue efforts, but now there's someone looking out for the canines, too. 
"Our mission on this deployment was actually twofold," said Wesley Bissett, an assistant professor at the Texas A&M School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Science and director of the Veterinary Emergency Team (VET). "One was to support Texas Task Force 1 and care for the search and rescue dogs they're using, and the other was to care for some of the rescued animals." 
Bissett has been at an outpost in Bastrop since Wednesday tending to the five or so rescue dogs and, along with the other 12 members of his team, caring for some 120 rescued pets and wildlife that were affected by the massive Bastrop County Complex fire. 
The VET team has been funded and ready to deploy since 2009. The idea for the team developed after responses to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, and again with Ike in 2008.
"That really changed the point of view of the importance of providing for animals during an emergency," he said. "So, we've been ready, but this is our first major deployment."
Texas Task Force 1 demobilized the team responding to Bastrop Monday afternoon, meaning the VET team will be following shortly after, but Bissett said the group remains ready to help elsewhere in the state if needed.
He said there have been several happy stories out of Bastrop, with owners finding pets they let loose but couldn't evacuate with. 
"In many cases, that pet was all they had left," he said. "So, it's meant a lot to them."
There are two ways for the VET team to deploy, he said. One is when TTF1 deploys search and rescue dogs, the group will go in support. The other is for county officials who may not be able to care for animals in an emergency to contact the Texas Animal Health Commission and request the VET team be deployed. 
In Leon County, Judge Byron Ryder said he hasn't heard residents inquire about lost pets, but some did let livestock go during the evacuation. 
"For instance, we've got one family that has to repair four miles of fencing before they can get their livestock back," he said. "But they all have brands, so they'll more than likely be recovered."
In Grimes County, Sheriff Don Sowell said besides some monkeys let loose by a landowner in Waller County, he hasn't heard from residents looking for their pets.

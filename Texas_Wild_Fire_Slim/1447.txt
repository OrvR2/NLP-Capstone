The Rodeo Drive Committee has announced that Beverly Hills’ celebration of Fashion’s Night Out will return to Rodeo Drive and the 90210 as a part of the global shopping event on Thursday, September 8, 2011 from 6 to 10 pm.  The iconic Ferris Wheel that won rave reviews last year and became the symbol of the West Coast’s participation is back for complimentary rides with proof of purchase at participating retailers in 90210 on that day.  “As one of the most renowned shopping streets in the world, Rodeo Drive will be transformed to celebrate fashion for one night,” says BROOKS BROTHERS’ General Manager and Rodeo Drive Committee President Jim Jahant.  “This year, Rodeo Drive is going above and beyond with what will likely be the most famous high-end fashion carnival ever created.  Fashion’s Night Out is also an opportunity to remind consumers of the importance of fashion, retail and shopping to our local economy.”  The three-block stretch of Rodeo Drive annually accounts for approximately $360 million in sales or nearly $1 million per day.  This year, watch out for a variety of well-dressed specialty performers including flamethrowers and stilt walkers turning Rodeo Drive into a virtual Midway.  “Fashion’s Night Out is about making fashion fun,” says Kathy Gohari, regional director of VALENTINO and event co-chair for Rodeo Drive’s celebration of Fashion’s Night Out.  “Our carnival theme with a chic international fashion twist was a big hit with more than an estimated 10,000 guests last year.  For 2011, we have so many more exciting elements—where else can you have fashion, food and fun all in three blocks?”  The evening’s festivities will include 100 in-store events, numerous cocktail parties, celebrity appearances, extended shopping hours, flamethrowers, stilt walkers, fifteen of Los Angeles’ top gourmet food trucks and Cirque du Soleil’s Flipbook Experience on Rodeo Drive where visitors have the opportunity to insert themselves into the spectacular new IRIS show from Cirque du Soleil at the Kodak Theatre.  In addition to Rodeo Drive boutiques, Beverly Hills’ most renowned department stores NEIMAN MARCUS and SAKS FIFTH AVENUE will also participate in Fashion’s Night Out in the 90210.  As a part of GUCCI’s 90th anniversary celebration this year, the store will feature the Limited Edition FIAT ‘500 by Gucci’.  The cinquecento, designed by Gucci Creative Director Frida Gianinni and FIAT’s  design team, will only be featured on Rodeo Drive and in New York City for FNO.  “When the FIAT 500 first hit the road in the fifties, it created a style revolution,” says Creative Director Frida Gianinni.     “Gucci’s history has always been about traveling in style, so when this collaboration came up, it struck me as the perfect opportunity to create a new modern travel statement.”   Stop by CHANEL to get your hands on three new nail shades, created exclusively for Fashion’s Night Out by Peter Philips, Creative Director of CHANEL Makeup.  At FENDI, you cannot miss the ‘Atelier Fendi’ exhibition of images from the FW11 ad campaign, shot by Karl Lagerfeld.  Dress for the occasion at LA PERLA, where you are invited to the store’s “Roaring 20’s Cocktail Party.” Get styling tips at ST.JOHN from Stylist Amber Ventura, while your man is at WESTIME spinning beats with DJ Dom P.  Luxury retailers from BALLY to GIORGIO ARMANI, LOUIS VUITTON to TIFFANY & CO. will be open for your shopping experience.   Additionally, seventeen top gourmet food trucks will fuel hungry shoppers along Rodeo and Beverly Drive with an eclectic selection of tastes.  That is more than double the number of trucks Rodeo Drive had last year; so shoppers can treat themselves to a charitable dinner at Cart For a Cause or get their hands on a slice at Tino’s Pizza Truck.  Maine comes to Beverly Hills with the Lobsta Truck and New Jersey makes its presence with the Greasy Weiner.  Shoppers also have the option of breakfast for dinner at the Buttermilk Truck or mini monster sliders at Me So Hungry.  If guests are craving a cheesy snack, they can visit the famous Cheeseball Wagon or Nacho Truck that evening.  You can’t miss a knock out taco at KO Taco, or juicy burger at Fatburger located on Beverly Drive.  To top it all off, foodies will be able to indulge in desserts from Sprinkles Cupcakes, Waffles De Liege, Tango Mango, Breezy Freeze and Coolhaus -- strategically located near architect Rem Koolhaas’ PRADA Epicenter store.  But the most beautiful and fragrant part of Rodeo Drive’s food truck frenzy will be fresh flowers at The Flower Truck.  This year, trucks will be featuring a special Limited Edition Fashion’s Night Out menu item, which is only available on Rodeo Drive.   Rodeo Drive is proud to partner with world famous CIRQUE DU SOLEIL to create a special experience in Beverly Hills as a part of Fashion’s Night Out and to celebrate the arrival of the much anticipated IRIS production at the Kodak Theatre.  In between visiting their favorite stores, shoppers will have the opportunity to take photos as if they were in the IRIS show and create a custom flipbook. If that isn’t enough, shoppers will have a chance to win tickets to the live performance and other special surprises.   Rodeo Drive 90210’s celebration of Fashion’s Night Out is presented by the Rodeo Drive Committee in association with the City of Beverly Hills and the Beverly Hills Conference and Visitors Bureau.  Fashion’s Night Out in Beverly Hills is sponsored by Cirque du Soleil, Gilt City, Southwest Airlines, Luxe Rodeo Drive Hotel, The Beverly Hilton, and FAB Photo.

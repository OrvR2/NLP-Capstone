Peter Negron 10 years later: ‘I miss you so much, Dad’By Jess Wisloski | The Upshot – 22 hours ago


When Peter Negron's father, a Port Authority project manager, died in his office at the World Trade Center, the boy was only 11.
Immediately after the attacks, he was one of more than a thousand children left suddenly without a parent. His dad, Pete Negron, 34, worked on the 88th floor of WTC 1 on environmental issues. Living in Bergenfield, N.J., with his mother Leila, and 2-year-old brother, he spent that first Father's Day of 2002 angry.
"I don't want to talk to nobody, see nobody, do nothing," he told a news reporter then. "I just want to go to the cemetery and say that I love him..."
Two years later, the thin 13-year-old stood in a dark suit, steeped with grief, to shakily read a poem in front of the whole nation. It was "Stars," written by children's author Deborah Chandra:
"I like the way they looked down from the sky / And didn't seem to mind  the way I cried / And didn't say, 'Now wipe away those tears,' / Or, 'Tell  us, tell us what's the matter here!' / But shining through the dark they  calmly stayed / And gently held  me in their quiet way.  / I felt them watching over me, each one / And let me cry and cry till I was done."
Peter Negron, 13, reads the poem 'Stars' on Sept. 11, 2003, at the second anniversary of the WTC attacks in which …
Today the 21-year-old appeared again in front of the nation, and this time shared a message of strength, growth and reflection.
He spoke about how he's tried to fill his father's shoes for his brother Austin, who turned 12 on September 1.
"I try to teach him all the things my father taught me. How to catch a baseball, how to ride a bike," and to work hard in school, he said.
He never stops missing his father in the important moments of life.
"I wish my dad had been there to teach me how to drive, ask a girl  on a date, and see me graduate from high school," he said, choking up. "And a hundred other things I  can't even begin to name."
He said he's learned more about his father since his death. "He cared about the earth, and our future. I know he wanted to make a difference," he said. He wants to do the same.
"I have decided to become a forensic scientist," he said. "I hope I can make my father proud of the young men that my brother and I have become. I miss you so much, Dad."

The boy's father was taken away from him because of a bunch of blood sacks thought they were doing the imaginary lord's will. What a world our children are going to have to change.

There are NO WORDS to describe the devastation. I am still deeply sorry for those who perished and for their grieving families, Equally for the Soldiers of the Nations that went to war and lost their lives and their grieving families. For a few crazy people, thousand/millions will suffer for generations and the Economy suffers too which affects millions of workers.
I heard it on TV and Radio and I remember vividly what happened 10 years ago.
It was a TSUNAMI of a disgrace and problems galore. 
I hope anythig similar will NEVER happen again anywhere.

and... so... where's the memorial for all the iraqi and afghan children murdered at the hands of U.S. servicemen and women? where are the candlelight vigils for all the innocent men and women who died during the american missile attacks of baghdad?  what happened to the memory of fallujah? the hideousness of abu ghraib? 
 showlights and pompousness for new york.... but for others, only death and silence...

God had His hands on everything which happened on that day. He is a God of Love and affection. He was there when people were calling for Him, He was there when people were asking for help. He had a mighty reason why this happened. We have to love the muslims as they don't know what they are doing. I wouldn't say that all are evil, I know so many muslim friends who are very intelligent. We as Christians should be able to show them who is the real God of the Universe.

I've lost my parents, too, and so I understand where this man is coming from. Humans are stupid. We're quite selfish and delusional. We can't just stop at disagreements, we have to show our differences through things like death and destruction. Nothing I say will change the world indefinitely, but I'd like to think that maybe one day our differences and determination to be right wont cause us to destroy everything that we've been lucky enough to experience and everything we've worked so hard to build.

I still remember all the high school boys saying how they would run away to Canada or Mexico if a draft ever happened. What a bunch of pansies we have now in this country. I would hope if a fight that clearly threatened our nation that the majority of men would step up along with some women that also did in WW2. It really doesn't matter whether you agree with the war or not. Because when it comes down to it when I was in Iraq most of the first firing came from them and not us. I can't speak for all situations or battles. Why would you fire on us first? They know what we will and will not do, they are not completely ignorant about the military troops not being able to fire without "permission"

GO AHEAD, ALL YOU ASSHOLES AND MORONS POSTING YOUR CRAP ON THIS THREAD. Don't Forget !!  People around the world can log on and read your vicious, hateful remarks. Foreigners across the planet can read with their own eyes and know in their minds, that American is a truly vicious , heartless bastion of stupidity and hatred. And we LOVE wallowing in our hatred and ignorance..it makes us feel powerful and justified when at best, we are turning into a sniveling cesspool of rampant self imposed destruction. America has NOT LONG to survive based on many of the asinine remarks witnessed here .

nunca olvidaremos ese dia, esperaba las 12 del medio dia para llevar a mi hijo jay al Hosp. para operarlo, me habia pasado toda la noche en vela pues el DR. me habia dicho que no lo descuidara, me sente un rato a descansar y prendi la tv para ver a despierta america y de repente fue interrupido el programa para dar la noticia;al principio se pensaba q fue un avion q. choco accidentalmente,pero dando la noticia se vio al otro avion atacando la 2nda torre,yo le dije a mi otro hijo Jeff yo creo q. hay guerra, wao fue terrible,ver a los q. se tiraban de los edificios,parecia una pelicula de accion,como una q. vi hace tiempo con Paul newman y steve macqueen,(rip) towering inferno 1974 ;pero no no era una pelicula era lamentablemente realidad.Sigo sin entender , si esto paso en un sitio donde se supone q. haya seguridad! Bueno les dejo con sus propios pensamientos,eso si solamente en CRISTO estamos seguros,pues aunque partamos de aqui el nos recibe alla. Dios les de paz y consuelo a los familiares de los q. murieron el 9/11/01 y tenga misericordia de esta nacion.

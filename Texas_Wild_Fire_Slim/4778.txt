Pakistan: Plot to free bin Laden wivesInformation that led to the warning was reliableUpdated: Friday, 09 Sep 2011, 6:21 AM CDTPublished : Friday, 09 Sep 2011, 6:21 AM CDT

ASHRAF KHAN,Associated Press

KARACHI (AP) â Pakistan is warning that the Taliban are plotting to get Osama bin Laden's wives and children freed by kidnapping a government official and then offering to exchange him for the slain al-Qaida chief's family. U.S. Navy seals killed bin Laden in a May raid on his house in northwestern Pakistan. At least two of his wives and several children who were living with him have since been detained by Pakistani authorities. Pakistan's interior ministry warned of the purported plot in a letter marked "secret" that was sent to top security officials around the country. The Associated Press obtained a copy on Friday. The ministry says the information that led to the warning was reliable. It doesn't say which Pakistani official the Taliban plan to kidnap.

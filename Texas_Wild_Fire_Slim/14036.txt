With U-Box Portable Storage, you pick up or we deliver the U-Boxes, you fill them up and we store them in our secure warehouse or deliver them to a location of your choice.(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b)In addition to the 30-days-free self-storage assistance being offered, U-Haul locations throughout central Texas will also be collecting donations of gently used household goods, furniture and clothing for families and Texas residents whose homes have been destroyed. Also, people who need boxes can take advantage of the U-Haul Take a Box, Leave a Box Program. The program enables customers to return their reusable boxes and allows others to take them as needed - FREE. U-Haul encourages anyone who has any type of reusable box to drop it off at the nearest U-Haul location and allow another family to reuse the box, free of charge, instead of throwing the reusable box into the recycling bin. Families needing more information about the 30-days-free self-storage assistance program or residents who have items to donate should contact the following regional offices:U-Haul Company of Northern Houston1617 San JacintoHouston, TX 77002(713) 750-7739U-Haul Company of Southern Houston8518 Highway 6 SouthHouston, TX 77083(281) 495-2303U-Haul Storage Centers of Houston2415 South Dairy Ashford RoadHouston, TX 77077(281) 531-4022 "With more than 1,000 homes destroyed within the last several days, these wildfires have caused critical damage, and are continuing to spread throughout the communities we serve," stated Gary Bouillion, area district vice president, U-Haul operations.

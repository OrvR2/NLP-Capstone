To everyone that has put a bogus post. This has nothing to do with Obama or the administration. This is about the everyday person doing something above and beyond. You are not putting down the gov. when you post negative comments on here. You are putting down a hero that has saved a﻿ life and didn't think about themselves. If you must post something bad about the gov. please do so elsewhere. This is for a regular person like you or me to receive the honor they deserve. Show some respect please.

JOHN BOLTON IS A TRUE TERRORIST.
He has lied for YEARS in order to murder people.
John Bolton is clearly a Traitor to the United States.
His lies are well documented, and his pathetic attempts to wage more war are treasonous acts right out﻿ in the open.
John Bolton is a washed up old man singing his last swan song.
When this fucking Nazi DIES the world will not miss him.
Neoconservatism is DEAD.
And John Bolton is a JOKE.

IGNORE THE TROLLS. Republicans want to repeal the health care bill bringing back the doughnut hole for seniors and allowing insurance companies to discriminate against people for having pre-existing﻿ conditions. VOTE DEMOCRAT!!!

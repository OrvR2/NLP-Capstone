BASTROP - Dennis Silman was in line at the store when his wife's urgent call came  through: They needed to get out. Smoke was drifting up through the  woods and the wildfire that just 30 minutes earlier wasn't near enough  to pose a problem was visible over the treetops by the time he got home.
In  just 90 minutes, Silman was able to make four trips loading clothes and  a few important possessions into his Mustang. He could feel the blaze's  heat and hear the crackling roar as he packed his car. Less than two  hours after they drove away for the last time Sunday, the Bastrop  Complex fire consumed his home and six other houses of relatives who all  lived within about four square miles of each other.
"My house, my  sister-in-law, her brother, my mother-in-law and three brothers-in-law  houses are gone," the 53-year-old bail bondsman said Wednesday outside  the county convention center where he came to find out about federal  assistance. "Everything's gone now."
Fed by stiff winds and  extreme drought, the more than 33,000-acre blaze had blackened about 45  square miles in and around Bastrop, about 25 miles east of Austin,  leaving two people dead and consuming nearly 1,400 homes by early  Thursday, according to the Department of Public Safety. The White House  said President Barack Obama telephoned Gov. Rick Perry to say the  federal government would continue providing firefighting assistance and  quickly assess requests for more aid.
Many Bastrop residents said  they had received cell phone photos or videos from those who sneaked  back into the fire zone or from volunteer firefighters and police who  checked on friends' homes. Others were left to crowd around lists of the  lost street addresses posted at the county convention center.
The  fire was about 30 percent contained Wednesday and firefighters hoped to  take advantage of low winds to make more progress. The destruction has  made the blaze the most catastrophic of more than 170 fires that have  erupted in the past week — one of the most devastating wildfire  outbreaks in state history, which has been blamed for a total of four  deaths.
The outbreak has made this the state's costliest wildfire  season on record, with $216 million in firefighting expenses since late  2010. The crisis is unfolding months after Perry signed a budget that  cut funding to the Texas Forest Service by one-third. Yet the agency  insisted that being $35 million lighter hasn't left Texas less equipped  to fight the latest fires.
Under the new budget, which went into  effect last week, no firefighters in the Forest Service were laid off,  said Robbie Dewitt, the agency's finance officer. Moreover, the forest  service said it will spend whatever is necessary from state coffers to  deal with the disaster and have the expenses accounted for later by  state leaders.
Texas Task Force 1, an elite search team, mobilized  Wednesday in Bastrop to search the smoldering ruins for more victims.  But several thousand people successfully evacuated ahead of the fire,  and Bastrop County Emergency Management Coordinator Mike Fisher said  about 2,500 people had stopped by one of the county's shelters. Many  more people likely stayed with family or friends.
Some residents  needed no urging to leave because they saw the flames lapping at the  trees. Others heard from friends and neighbors, while still others found  a sheriff's deputy at their door or heard firemen rolling down the  street with bullhorns. In most cases no one had to be told twice. A  wildfire here two years ago drove people from their homes and everyone  knew about the severity of the drought.
That was the case for Jose "Pepe" Gomez, 57, who had just returned from church to his girlfriend's house Sunday afternoon.
"We  were going to celebrate my girlfriend's grandson's birthday, who is  only two ...We were going to have a pool party at her swimming pool,  have cake for the kids, then they said 'get out,'" Gomez said. "We got  evacuated from three locations on that same day. In less than 12 hours  we were evacuated three times."
"When you looked up you could see this huge cloud ... we knew it was serious," he said.
Gomez said his girlfriend lost everything after having only enough time to grab a little clothing for her kids and a Bible.
"She was in hysteria when she was told her house was leveled," Gomez said. It was the second home she lost to fire.
Brenda  Sanders, a 63-year-old hospice nurse whose home had so far survived the  blaze, said she had been oblivious to the fire until a sheriff's deputy  came to her door. She and her husband had about 20 minutes to gather  items. They grabbed the flags that were on their fathers' caskets, some  important insurance documents, mementos from her husband's high school  and college football career and their cats.
"It's just been a nightmare," she said. "It's been surreal, the whole experience."
Her  friend Denise Rodgers, 56, a hospice chaplain, was not so fortunate.  Her house in Tahitian Village burned. First, a friend sent her a photo  showing her house untouched. "I was thinking I was in the clear." But  later she received a shaky video of the flames circling her home and  climbing up one side.
"I could see it coming, you know, over the  trees," Rodgers said of her last minutes in the house. "I could see the  pink glow so I knew it was close."

Just as oil and water don't mix, honesty, integrity, and compassion don't mix with politics.

If the govt. won't let you cut down cedars for environmental reasons,  cedars do two things over time:  1.  They rape the land of water.  2. the accumulating brush makes the inevitable fires much worse when they do occur.   

We should have learned from the Yellowstone Park fire a few years ago:  nature's way of sustaining a healthy forest includes periodic clean out fires.   To prevent this is to create both an unhealthy forest and a danger of really bad fires.

Clean up around your residence and install plenty of water hose connections. The natural look is not always the best.

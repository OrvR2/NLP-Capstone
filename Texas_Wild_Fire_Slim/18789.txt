the butterfly's tale;Swarms of butterflys were once widespread across our countrysides, but now you will be lucky to see one or two...The decline is due to Industrial agriculture, the loss of 97%  England's natural grasslands and wildflower meadows, the increase of motorways and urban development plus climate change which brings new predators and diseases..Butterflys are essential eco system pollinators benefiting both agriculture and medical science for its plant derived medecines, as well as being sensitive indicators of environmental change.The last species extinct in Britain, the Large Blue (Maculinea Arion)(d.1979) was re-established in the 1980's by Professor Thomas, who stated "What is bad for butterflys is bad for all species -- including our own''. ( http://www.butterflyworldproject.com/ )Other Species recently extinct in the UK; Mazarine Blue (d.1904) Black-Veined White (d.1925) &  Large Tortoiseshell(d.1970's). Currently 1/3 of only 435 species in Europe are under threat...Around the world the Large Copper of Ireland, Giant Swallowtail of Jamaica, Atewa of Ghana, American Silverspot and Apollo of the Alps have also become extinct.In The USA the Monarch butterfly now faces drastic reductions following destruction of their milkweed seeding plant by biotech agricultural chemicals.On a brighter note, in 2008 Sir David Attenborough the BBC's Natural history broadcaster launched a £25m conservation project to reverse this disaster. Butterfly World, has 250 species flying in its dome, and also hosts extensive gardens and meadows to attract native British species. ( http://www.butterflyworldproject.com/ )To save the butterfly, plant suitable nectar producing plants, the best are the Buddlea, Ice-plant, Lavender, Michaelmas Daisy and Marjoram. Caterpillars also need feeding so plant Holly and Ivy in sunny positions where they can grow tall and flower, & keep the Stinging Nettles as these are home for the Comma, Small Tortoiseshell and Red Admiral butterflys.Original Poem the butterfly's tale c.

Your words are so true. Everyone you talk to have the same thing﻿ to say and that is "we can't do anything about it!" That is because most people don't try!

I really enjoyed this video! The butterfly is a symbol of appreciation. Fairy artist Josephine Wall﻿ sent me a card wishing us well with our fight to keep the school butterfly meadow. The card had her painting of the Butterfly Goddess with a poem: Merrily they flit from flower to flower, unaware of their important role in the continuing cycle of Nature's glorious full-blossoming. A big company could support this school and help them protect our butterflies and our environment!

There's no doubt, we're in danger. We're letting those insane with power destroy our beautiful world. I can't imagine a world without butterflies...birds... I don't want to live﻿ in that kinda world, even if it's possible. Nothing is really going to stop them though, until we find value in ourselves. We're so fearful and insecure--drunk with the belief that we have no value, no "magic." And so we don't value the world and all her magical creatures.

Thank you for getting to me in SL, this movie and storie is so tru. I love nature myself.
Hope you got a good talk with the owner of Etopia:), and as I told you I was one of the first who moved in there, this autum it is 4 years ago. At that time there was a lot of nature, like today, if you walked at﻿ the street you got apples on your head:) I loved that.
This was a wonderful movie, thank you for sharing with me:)
Hope to see you inworld, and have a talk with you

All creatures "great and small" must to be in harmony with Mother Earth, and I believe with the coming of 12/21/12 and the ascension we will, as a global﻿ society, wake up and move in that direction. If we do not, we face extinction.
Thank you and Namaste,

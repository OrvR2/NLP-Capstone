Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison, John Cornyn ask Obama for Texas wildfire aid

Gov. Rick Perry isn’t the only Texas elected official demanding federal disaster aid from President Barack Obama for the scorched state.
Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn joined Perry Tuesday in asking Obama to immediately issue a federal disaster declaration for Texas, where fires have burned through more than 2.2 million acres of land.
The Republican senators sent a letter to Obama that expressed their “concern regarding the Administration’s inaction” for a federal disaster declaration, which would provide the state with more federal aid to combat the fires.

Since the beginning of this year, nearly 7,000 wildfires have erupted across Texas. “It is paramount that the State and localities receive the vital resources and funding required to fully support their work,” according to Hutchison and Cornyn.
Fighting fires “has imposed a tremendous physical and financial strain on all involved,” the senators wrote. “The importance of reducing this burden cannot be overstated.”
Perry made headlines last week when he complained that Obama had quickly declared Alabama a disaster area after the worst tornadoes in four decades — but had not issued a similar declaration for Texas. Perry has suggested that the Obama administration is carrying out a political vendetta against Texas.

The President
The White House
Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear President  Obama:
We are writing to express our concern  regarding the Administration’s inaction on the state of Texas’ request for a  federal disaster declaration due to current and recent wildfires.  On April 18,  2011, we wrote to Administrator Fugate regarding our constituents and  their struggle to combat and control the  wildfires that have engulfed large portions of Texas.  We ask for your swift intervention  into this matter that greatly influences our State’s ability to respond to and  mitigate these devastating fires.
Since the beginning of this year, almost  7,000 individual wildfires have burned more than 2.2 million acres.  This has  resulted in the destruction of homes, businesses, farms and ranches, and the  death of two brave firefighters.  Due to the heroic actions of first responders  from across the State and from across the country, countless lives, property and  communities have been saved.  This grueling work has imposed a tremendous  physical and financial strain on all involved.  The importance of reducing this  burden cannot be overstated.
With efforts underway to stop the advance  and extinguish multiple wildfires across Texas, it is paramount that the State and  localities receive the vital resources and funding required to fully support  their work.  While the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has issued  numerous Fire Management Assistance Declarations, the Administration still has  not acted upon the State’s request for a federal disaster declaration and made  available Category B (Emergency Protective Services) through FEMA’s Public  Assistance program.  We ask that you approve and issue a federal disaster  declaration to provide our distressed constituents, communities and the State  with the necessary financial resources to continue to combat these fires.
We appreciate your efforts to address the  concerns of all Texans on this issue, and we will continue to work with you and  the administration on this matter.
Sincerely,
KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON                                                                  JOHN  CORNYN
United States  Senator                                                                           United  States Senator

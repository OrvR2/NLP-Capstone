How can you say no to these adorable puppy dog eyes?
(SCROLL DOWN FOR PHOTOS)
San Francisco Animal Care and Control has fallen on dire times. "The shelter is now at maximum capacity and has no kennel space available for incoming dogs," ACC spokesperson Deb Campbell told the SF Appeal.
As a result, the organization is seeking "foster pet owners" to act as temporary caregivers to any number of their residents and asking those looking to give up their dog or cat to wait until more space becomes available. 
"It's something we haven't really run across before," ACC Deputy Director Kat Brown told SFGate of the overcrowding. "People have to make these hard decisions about giving up a dog because they're either out of work, have to move, or can no longer afford to keep their dog."
An unprecedented number of pets have passed through ACC this past year, with 2,800 taking up residency in the shelter (an increase of 300 compared to last year). To incentivize rescues, officials have reduced adoption fees by 50 percent until September 12.
Take a look at some of the sweet pooches and kitties currently available at the shelter below, and visit ACC's website to learn more about fostering, adopting, or donating to the cause.

				I would always adopt but they price it so high most cant afford to even adopt them. You could get a purbred pup for what they are asking. In this day and age you cant pay as much as they ask. If you are able to give the animal a good home and FIX them that should be enough.

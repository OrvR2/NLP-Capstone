247.11 Crepes Mille
Dog Friendly, Things To Do In Austin, Trailer Eatery | 6 Sep 2011

My thoughts are with everyone’s lives have been affected by the fires. I am working on compiling a list that has what donation centers are seeking and where you can drop off. Feel free to leave comments on today’s post with donation centers you would like included.

My mind always does this rather bizarre thing where it thinks it doesn’t like crepes, but then every time I have one I really like it.
I was on South Congress a few weeks ago and thought I would give them a try and discovered, yet again, that I love crepes!
Crepes Mille has a sweet and a savory side to the menu, so you can have the best of both worlds. And if you order two savories, you can get one from the sweet side for free. My sister and I got a few random items, like a pepperoni pizza crepe, that ended up being great. I definitely want to go back and try the shrimp scampi and the rotisserie chicken crepes, but those will have to wait for my next visit.

On the sweet side, you can’t go wrong. Order the “easy crepe” and put your favorites on top. Milk chocolate and Oreo cookie do the trick for me. Their menu is huge, so you can keep going back and trying new things, which is cool.
Let me caution you, they are made fresh, so expect a little bit of a wait.

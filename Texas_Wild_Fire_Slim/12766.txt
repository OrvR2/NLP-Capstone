9/11 remembered with memorials, music in Bay Area 09.12.11









Some remembered lost friends. Some honored the heroism of people they never met who died saving others. Some longed for a sense of unity that now seems long gone.
The 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks brought Bay Area residents together Sunday at a march in San Jose, a memorial in Union City, an afternoon of music in San Francisco. People felt compelled to mark the occasion, sometimes in very different ways.
Firefighters read aloud the names of their New York counterparts killed in the collapse of the World Trade Center's twin towers. Demonstrators massed on the Golden Gate Bridge to protest the wars - in Afghanistan and Iraq - that followed the attacks. 
Parents struggled to explain the day to children born after 9/11. Public officials urged Americans to set aside their divisions and see themselves as one people again, the way they had in the weeks after that horrible day.
And in gatherings throughout the area, people remembered the moment a decade ago when they heard the news.
 "The events of that day are forever etched in my memory," said Laurie Coe, 55, of Redwood City. "I was getting my daughters ready for school, and I was consumed with worry about my relatives on the East Coast."
Opera in the Park
Coe got up at 5 a.m. Sunday to watch the national memorial ceremonies on television. Then she her friend Kate Mulligan, 54, of Burlingame went to Golden Gate Park to hear the San Francisco Opera sing Mozart's Requiem, along with selections from American composers. This year, the annual Opera in the Park festival served as the city's official Sept. 11 commemoration.
Mulligan remembered going on her morning run 10 years ago. She ran past a hotel lobby and saw a crowd glued to a news broadcast.
"I went right home and turned on the TV," she recalled. "My daughter came down and asked what was wrong. I just started bawling. I said, 'The world has changed.' "
In Union City, about 400 people gathered to remember the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93, who struggled against hijackers to retake control. Originally bound for San Francisco, the aircraft plunged into an open field in Pennsylvania rather than strike its presumed target: the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C.
A line of red-granite pillars - one for each of the 33 passengers and seven crew members - curves through a small park in Union City. Of the hundreds of people who gathered there Sunday to listen to speeches, most didn't know the names inscribed on the stones. Mary Koch, however, did.
As a United flight attendant 10 years ago, she'd worked with four of the deceased, including the captain, Jason Dahl. Koch remembered him as funny and proud, always showing off family photos.
Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw was a spiritual woman, while her colleague Lorraine Bay was "just hilarious," said Koch, 46.
"I felt so proud of them and the courage it must have taken," she said.
"They were truly the first responders," said Leslie Duenas, 65, a former United flight attendant from Newark. 
Sarah Green, 5, ran along the stones, yelling "It's America Day!" Her parents, Brad and Joy Green of Pleasanton, said they weren't sure how to tell Sarah and her 2-year-old brother, Ben, what the day meant. 
"How do you explain?" said Joy, 39. "I told them it was to honor the people who lost their lives. I also said it was like visiting their grandma at the graveyard. You don't want to scare the heck out of them."
S.F. firefighters' yearly ritual
Early Sunday, at every fire station in San Francisco, firefighters repeated a yearly ritual in which they mark the moment the South Tower of the World Trade Center fell and read the names of the 343 firefighters and paramedics who died on 9/11.
"You have to acknowledge the magnitude of this," said Capt. Jon Delbino at San Francisco's Station 7 on Folsom Street.
Shortly before noon, war protesters marched on the Golden Gate Bridge, meeting at the center. They decried the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that followed 9/11.
The protesters noted that more than 6,000 American troops have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan - roughly double the number killed in the terrorist attacks in the United States. The money spent on the wars, some said, would have been better spent improving health care or schools in this country. 
In 2003, before the U.S. invasion of Iraq, tens of thousands of people converged on San Francisco from around the state to participate in antiwar marches. On Sunday, there were a couple hundred at most. 
"It's very discouraging," said Fred Norman, 75, of Pleasanton. Many people say they disagree with the wars, but "almost none of them do anything to oppose them."
Many of Sunday's events focused on healing. Opera in the Park opened with a processional of representatives from a dozen religious traditions, set to "March of the Priests" from Mozart's "Magic Flute." 
Maha ElGenaidi, president and chief executive of the Islamic Network Group, offered a homily in tribute to the victims of the attack and a broader denunciation of all ideological violence.
Turning trauma into hope
Baritone Thomas Hampson sang "For We Fought Side by Side," an excerpt from the opera "Heart of a Soldier," which had its world premiere Saturday night at the War Memorial Opera House. The opera is based on the real-life story of a man who was credited with saving many lives from the World Trade Center before returning one last time to the burning building, never to be seen again.
For those in the audience, it was a chance to turn a traumatic moment of history into something new and beautiful.
"It was kind of strange to wake up this morning and replay all those events in my head," said Jesse Moyer, 27, attending Opera in the Park for the first time. "It's nice that they're able to combine those awful memories with something artistic like this."

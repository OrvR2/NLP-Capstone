I never said that the attempt to save the plane never happened, I am talking about the other blatant holes in the story. just move﻿ on.

@BriansVideoHobby
I﻿ never said this video supported the theory, if anything it supports the official story.
seems your not paying attention.

@spydat3k0 ﻿ There are ZERO facts supporting a conspiracy and mile high piles of evidence that it was exactly what it was, an attack. This story ended a decade ago. Let the victims have their peace.
When are you going to explain what this video shows that supports a conspiracy theory?

@spydat3k0 A dozen witnesses, 37 phone calls, radar, cockpit recorders, all video (including this﻿ one) and all other evidence support an attempted take over by the passengers. What do you have countering that? Nothing. Zero.
Oh, by the way, Bush DID order all other hijacked planes shot down, so what would they be covering up here again?

@spydat3k0 There is a HUGE hole in your theory: Bush DID order any additional planes to be shot down. He has ADMITTED PUBLICLY, many times, he ordered any additional hijacked planes to be shot down.
So, the BIG question is, why would they hide it if it was their intention to shoot them down?
There are, of course, other holes like the "mystery﻿ jet in the area" was identified a long time ago and no missile debris was found. Not to mention no witnesses to a shoot down. Give up the myths.

@rhiwa4 yeah that's definetly right...
but I don't think﻿ that they would have killed so much citizens just do get a better control about them

@vfbdan94
i know it sounds crazy.. but i think it is not only because of war and resources.
I think it was﻿ also a great opportunity to take the american people a lot of civil rights away. Just have a look at the patriots act. And here in Germany we have the "Antiterrorgesetze" now, not much better.
We let them take our freedom away without even recognizing. I think it's a lot about controlling the population, cause I don't think you can catch a terrorist with the "vorratsdatenspeicherung".

@2nub4you
actually, this is the first time in six years I've even paid attention to anything related to 9/11
the media is starting a damage control campaign, only reason I even posted this video.
if you have﻿ looked into 9/11, from both the official story and the conspiracy theory angle, then you would know that the conspiracy theory is actually a fact.
I think its time for you to move on.

@spydat3k0 this is too fucked up. I dont think that the CIA bombed London, Madrid and Bali. Of course, people like you try to seek﻿ proofs of a conspiracy but even if you did, what will you do after? Nothing. Now the United States are in big troubles(debt, hurricanes, job crisis) and if you still work your ass off 10 years later just to prove something hard to believe then you have no life.

Viellecht war er schon tot oder hat﻿ nie exestiert-wer weiß das schon !
Rex Tomb (FBI 2006) antwortete auf die Frage: Warum Bin Ladin nicht auf den Verhandlungsfotos abgebildet ist, folgt:
Er konnte wegen fehlender Beweismittel nicht angeklagt werden !
Ich habe mich vor langer Zeit mal mit dem Thema beschäftigt und dabei gemerkt was für eine witzige Märchen-Geschichte das überhaupt ist.
Ich muss da erstmal wieder reinkommen, bin aber Momentan mit einem anderen Thema beschäftigt !

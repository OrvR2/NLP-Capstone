			Texas fire destroys 1,554 homes, 17 people missing

All but 2 accounted for in Central Texas fires add to reading list




BASTROP, Texas (AP) — The number of homes destroyed by a Texas wildfire has risen to 1,554 and is expected to further increase as officials enter more areas where the blaze has been extinguished, officials said Sunday. Seventeen people remain unaccounted for.
Bastrop County officials joined by Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett sought to provide new information to hundreds of residents evacuated from their homes a week ago when blustering wind whipped up by Tropical Storm Lee swept across parched, drought-stricken Texas, helping to spark more than 190 wildfires statewide. The worst of the fires has consumed more than 34,000 acres (13,800 hectares) in this area 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Austin.
While sharing the bad news that the tally of destroyed homes will increase, officials also told some 100 residents who gathered at a news conference on Sunday that people would begin going back into the scorched areas on Monday. A detailed plan will allow residents to slowly enter the evacuated areas over the coming week as firefighters and emergency responders ensure the land has properly cooled, hotspots are extinguished and the blaze is contained.
Tensions and frustrations boiled over at a similar gathering on Saturday when residents demanded to be allowed to return to their neighborhoods to see what remains of their homes and attempt to salvage a few belongings. Many people were given only minutes to evacuate as the raging blaze surrounded homes and neighborhoods. Some had time to only gather a few important belongings. Others left with only the clothes on their back.
Still, Bastrop County Sheriff Terry Pickering said the 17 people unaccounted for may simply be out of town.
"They could have been on vacation," he said.
The federal government on Friday declared Texas a disaster area, paving the way for individuals to get financial aid.
On Monday, schools will open for the first time since the Bastrop blaze erupted. So many people are living in the town's Super 8, Best Western and Holiday Inn that school buses will stop at all three.
County emergency management director Mike Fisher said the Bastrop blaze is now 50 percent contained.
"We're gaining every hour, every shift," Fisher said.
The monster blaze that has done the most damage to Bastrop resulted when two fires joined a week ago. Investigators have been focused on containing the blaze and won't know for several weeks what caused it, Pickering said. Officials are investigating reports of arson in smaller fires, he said.
"We had reports from around the community of vehicles driving around that we suspect are starting fires," Pickering said. "I have no confirmation of that."
North of Houston, meanwhile, firefighters say a tri-county blaze that has consumed more than 20,000 acres (8,000 hectares) and destroyed nearly 60 homes is also half contained.

straittalker what kind of support would they have received?  Some magical rain cloud from Perry?  It's a drought, it's not like we can ship water to the farmers, since it's a drought, hence water problems, hence no rain...etc.  The situation is bad all over, and he's asked for help from Capital Hill.  We've got every piece of equipment we can afford fighting these fires.  It's amazing you people don't blame the goverment for every house fire, and for not stopping it.  This is nature, not politics.

Guess some forget that Rick has been back here already and has instituted action already.. He's sent the "Texas Task Force 1" in to help look for those who are missing. But I guess that isn't good enough for some of you. What the heck do you want the man to do? He's been keeping on top of his job and responsibilities here in Texas, while he's been back on the road. I suppose if Perry was on the front line fighting the fires along side the fire fighters that still wouldn't be good enough for you!!! I think it's funny how something like this that has No Blame on Perry, nor President Obama becomes this big political debate. It's a Wild Fire for crying out loud. He's handling it the best he can.. In fact the Best anyone could!

Rick is going to need the help of the federal government after this fire and if he wasn't such a stubborn fool the farmers in this State would have already received available help with the drought, dry crops and the cattle problem ruining their livelihood.

This story is not about my patriotism or where Obama was born (Hawaii by the way in case you haven't heard) or Rick Perry's slash and burn tactics while Argi Secretary or his desperate race for Lt. Governor. This story is about 17 people missing and 1550 homes destroyed. There is no glory in making an appearance at a site of tragedy---only human decency----but as Governor of the state if he doesn't want to leave Florida------hummmmm.

Dannyc, if Perry was in Texas, you would say he was a glory hound trying to cash in on disaster. Remember when you lose this next election and your Sacred Cow is sacrificed to the slaughter, Rick Perry will be in Texas, smiling and accepting the position. You see Danny, some of us remember Rick back when he was Agriculture Commissioner, and when he became Lieutenant Gov. we were all watching, where were you? Unlike your candidate Obama, Rick can prove quickly where he was born, where he has been and who his daddy is. Texans are not concerned today where Rick Perry spent his day, we have a much larger problem here. This is a classic example of how you can't see the forest for the trees. This story is about people dying and homes being destroyed, not who was having lunch with Rick. You just don't get it, not you or your political party. What did you do today on 911? Did you help anyone? Pay tribute? I'm betting not... now go do what you do best... moan, groan and complain.

Campaigning in Florida--where he has to backpedal over his hatred for Social Security---is more important to Rick Perry than 17 people missing and 1550 homes destroyed.

Megan Fox: How I Gained WeightUS Magazine – Thu, 8 Sep, 2011 3:18 PM EDT


Megan Fox got tired of hearing, "Eat a cheeseburger!"
The 25-year-old actress showed off her newfound shapely figure last month in L.A., but how did she acquire those healthy curves?  She ditched Veganism!
PHOTOS: Megan's incredible body through the years
"For a year and a half, until about four months ago, I followed a strict vegan diet based on raw fruits and vegetables," she told Amica magazine, as excerpted by the Daily Mail. "No bread, no sugar and coffee. But I had lost too much weight."

In March, Fox's trainer Harley Pasternak addressed the actress' then super-slim physique.  "Believe it or not she has this really fast metabolism," he told Hollywoodlife.com. "With her it's really about she's eating enough of the right things. People thought 'Oh she must be anorexic,' but she's far from that!"

In fact, Pasternak said the Jennifer's Body star struggled to gain weight.
So how did she put on a few healthy pounds? "Now, I eat a bit of everything," she told Amica magazine, adding that she still trains three times a week with Pasternak.

It doesn't matter because her career is toast. You don't piss off a bunch of directors with anti-Semitic remarks and be forgiven that quickly.

How dare she blame veganism on her weight loss, she just wasn't eating properly.  Now she makes veganism look bad when it is truly the healthiest way to eat, if you do it right

Naturally humans are omnivores and are animals. Those who deny being an animal is truly ignorant and obvious arrogant. As the food chain goes it would be natural we eat meat. 
As long as the animal wasn't tortured i believe its  to eat meat, after all not all animals are herbivores. 

Eating a bit of everything would ensure her to get enough nutrients and vitamins. The most important thing is to not only eat healthy but to exercise.

I eat a lot of everything and still can't figure out how to gain weight. I am seriously struggling to get my weight up to a normal healthy weight. I am getting tired of trying to convince people I am not starving myself! I thought I was the only one with this problem- guess I actually have something in common with a star. lol

Is it just me, but she looks the same size in both pics. She looks average size in both. To skinny, would be Angelina Joilie.

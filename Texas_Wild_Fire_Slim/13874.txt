Episcopal Diocese of Texas helps with fire relief

The Episcopal Diocese of Texas has been rallying church members to confront a wave of wildfires that have destroyed a 1,000 homes near Austin and are moving closer to Houston suburbs like Tomball.
According to a report by the diocese:
Several parishioners of Good Shepherd, Tomball have had to evacuate from fires northwest of Houston, and parishes in northeast Texas have also felt the effects of fires. In Longview, St. Michael and All Angels’ as well as Trinity Episcopal have reported smoke-filled skies from fires burning near Gladewater.
“Most of us woke up this morning with ash-covered cars,” said Donna Armstrong, Trinity’s parish administrator. “Its a little unnerving, but so far none of our parishioners have been directly affected.”
The Episcopal Diocese of Texas is headquartered in Houston and extends across most of central Texas, where the fires have been the worst.
In Bastrop, Rev. Lisa Hines and 15 other parishioners of Calvary Episcopal Church have lost their homes, the diocese said.
Calvary served as a shelter until it had to be evacuated. A number of Austin-area churches, including St. Luke’s on the Lake and the Episcopal Church of the Resurrection, are now distributing food, water and supplies to victims. Churches are collecting donations as well.
The church also had to cancel events at Camp Allen in Grimes County because roads leading to the retreat center are closed due to the fire.

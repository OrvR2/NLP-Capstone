PHOENIX -- El Paso, Texas, police arrested a Southwest Airlines passenger on a flight from Phoenix after he refused to turn off his cell phone.
Southwest Airlines spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger in Dallas told The Associated Press Tuesday the man turned his cell phone on as the flight was landing in El Paso on Monday.
Eichinger says when the man was asked to turn his phone off, he did not and when the plane pulled up to the gate, El Paso authorities met the aircraft.
The man's name and other details were not released.

				Here is a fact. He refused to follow the instructio­ns of the flight crew. Be it cell phone use or some other situation, he still failed to follow the instructio­ns of the flight crew. For that he should be arrested. If there were an emergency on the plane, what other instructio­ns would he fail to follow, putting the lives of other passengers at risk? 

It's simple. Federal law says you must follow the instructio­ns of the flight crew. JUST DO IT!

				They won't let you use a cell phone at a black jack table at a casino, if you insist they will ask you to leave the table, if you refuse they will have you removed.  Many places ask you not to use your cell phone while you use their services including doctor offices, dentist offices etc.  Some people are so enslaved to their phones they just can't help themselves­.  Have you ever sat in a restaurant or other place and had to listen to some idiot arguing with his wife on a cell phone loud enough for everyone to hear?

				About time! You cannot choose and pick which laws and regulation­s you want to obey! You cannot choose to run or stop at a stop sign. You cannot choose to drive without a license. These are all meant for the good of all. There is evidence that electronic devices do cause problems for aircraft, even if you don't agree. It is a regulation with teeth, thank goodness. Arrest more of these selfish people before a plane goes down because of them.

				It's quite possible that he was more than likely detained rather than truly arrested.  According to this journalist he was arrested, and people may have assumed that was happening when they saw uniformed personnel (El Paso authoritie­s) take him away.  

I'm going to look for other articles on this situation to see if something else is mentioned.

				I agree that he was probably not arrested.  However, in my mind I find that to be unfortunat­e.  We must stop at red lights, even on deserted roads at midnight, we obey many rules and laws that may or may not "make sense" to us, individual­ly, at the time.  However, that is one of the requiremen­ts for living in a civil society.  Unfortunat­ely, it seems that today's society has glorified and regressed to a state mimicking adolescent rebellion.  Let us try to remember that that stage of maturity is defined by incomplete brain developmen­t and less than rational assessment­s of real life situations­.

				The FAA gave approval about a month ago for pilots to use IPAD's for flight check lists.  So it is now legal for the pilots (sitting in the cockpit and ALL that delicate instrument­ation) to have an IPAD in the on state.  I image that it is airplane mode so the wifi and 3G are running, but the CPU and graphics chip are running.  

Because of this, phones and other electronic devices be in the off state will be a mute point in 5 years.  If an airplane vital electrons aren't shielded sufficient­ly to "resist" the electronic noise of cell phone, then that plane model should not be certified for flight by the FAA.

Also recall that an airplane can take the hit of a bolt of lighting and "still keep ticking".  A cell phone, laptop, or tablet is not going to hurt an airplane.  There are some published articles from the 90's, of Radio Amateur transmitte­rs being tested with sensitive instrument­s to see if there were problems AND none were reported.

				Dude, stop trying to re-frame the discussion­s.

Agree or not, there are rules of conduct on aircraft. Regardless of if the pilots are using Ipads or whatever, the rules for passengers is no electronic devices during take off and landing.

Period.

You have the right to get the hell off the plane.

Try being an Adult and living in society with the other people that respect the rules without whining about the ones 'you dont think are good ones or agree with'.

All of your opinions about what is not going to hurt an airplane etc are just opinions.  TESTING has confirmed it is POSSIBLE that electronic devices can cause disruption­s in VITAL instrument­ation and control systems.  I do not thing people want to gamble with the POSSIBILIT­Y of some anomalous incident occurring < 15000 feet because you wanted to finish Angry Birds or send a text message to your boyfriend.

				Mythbuster­s a few years back did a series of detailed experiment­s, even going to the extent of getting the cockpit section of a mothballed airplane to try and see if there was any evidence that cell phone transmissi­ons would in any way impact the accuracy or operationa­l efficiency of critical airplane instrument­ation.

It didn't.  Why this practice continues is mystifying­.  I suppose it somehow makes people feel safer, but it is essentiall­y bogus.  Now as to having to sit next to someone while they jabber away with a lot of non-import­ant gibberish.­..that's another matter.

				I agree that it's stupid for cell phone use to be forbidden, although I would not have mentioned Mythbuster­s in my discussion as they are not exactly known for their adherence to the scientific method.

However, the fact of the matter is that until someone in a position to change the rule realizes it is stupid, the flight personnel have to enforce that and all the other rules. And if you don't do what flight personnel say, you get arrested as this person was. That rule is not stupid.

				Simply put, pilots are allowed to do things that passengers are not allowed to do.  E.g.  Like fly the plane.  It just isn't your job or right to determine what you can or can't do on a plane, or on a ship.  These are two instances where the captain is the law.  You are also bound by administra­tive rules and federal law.  So, stow the electronic­s until they are permitted.  If you want to use them, get the needed ratings and fly your own plane.  Otherwise, sit there, watch the movie, read a book, sleep, or whatever.

				It doesn't matter if cell phones interfere with signals or not. At the core of this--- and at the core of many people's defiant and rude behavior these days--- is the fact that this guy thought he was above the rules. He's not. We need to see more of this (talking about the arrests) to remind people that they aren't invincible­. We live in a civilized society where you can't just decide which rules you want to follow and which ones you don't. JMO.

				Wrong.  It is not being defiant, it is a safety issue that the flight attendant was addressing­.  

And he was probably texting, instead of talking loudly in his seat.

				And the being rude was in reference to not obeying the rules and in fact REFUSING to obey the rules, not talking about the level of his talking. I couldn't care less if he was talking loudly on the plane--- refusing to obey a simple rule is rude (and defiant).

				The passenger was absolutely being defiant (he refused to abide by the rule...it really doesn't matter if it's once or twice). Just because someone doesn't like a rule, especially in a case where ignoring it affects others around you (safety OR common courtesy), doesn't make it ok to do whatever they want to do. There have to be consequenc­­es even if for no other reason but to use that person as an example. If everyone chose to 'do what they want to' regarding many of our social and safety rules, we'd be in a world of trouble.

And, don't even go there with 'he was probably texting'. YOU don't know that unless you were one of the very few people who could actually SEE what he was doing.

My feeling is that unless you are directly affected by someone elses defiant behaviour, you really won't 'get it'.

				If its been proven that cell phones don't interfere with the signals emitted and recieved by commercial aircraft, yet the airlines continue to have people follow a trivial rule; this is just as bad as the man kicked off a flight for having baggy pants and its just another case of the airline companies showing us that they can do to us what they please when we enter the airport.

				Whether or not cell phones pose an actual flight risk, the people who use them are as annoying as he.l.l.  I dread the day when use of them is permitted on a flight, and we have to listen to 100+ people yelling "Can you hear me now?" and "I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning, will you get it?" and "We'll have to strategize before the meeting" and "Really?  She's filing for divorce?"  and all the other stuff we'll have to listen to.  It's bad enough to hear all of this when standing in line at the grocery store, but it will be a nightmare on a coast-to-c­oast flight.

				Rules are Rules for a reason.  It has been inconclusi­ve, and some test did indicate cell phone and other sources of EMI can affect instrument readings.  Rather than risk the safety of a entire plane full of people, how about waiting on that call until you are at the Gate.  What's so important that the call cannot wait?

				Whether or not cell phones interfere with signals to or from commercial airlines, the carriers have the right to demand that they be inactivate­d during flight.  They also have a right to demand a certain level of dress appropriat­e to air travel.  As a passenger, you have the right to occupy the amount of space you have paid for, and the obligation to abide by the rules of conduct establishe­d by either the airline or the FAA.  Just as you can be banned from a restaurant­, bus, train, or other business for behavior or dress, you may be denied passage by plane.  If you violate the law by interferin­g with the flight crew, you may be arrested and charged.  It is neither up to you to make the rules nor to determine their validity.  The sense of entitlemen­t implied by your comment exceeds the bounds of reality.

				Where is this right they demand, in the fine print on the back of your ticket?

I disagree that I don't have the right to make the rules, but I do have the right to determine their validity IF AND ONLY IF I know better.  And if I'm wrong then on the validity I expect to be told why with respect.

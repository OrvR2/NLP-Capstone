2011-09-07: 
                     BASTROP, Texas -- One of the most devastating wildfire outbreaks in Texas history left more than 1,000 homes in ruins yesterday and stretched the state's firefighting ranks to the limit, confronting Gov. with a disaster at home just as the presidential contest heats up. More than 180 fires have erupted in the past week across the rain-starved Lone Star State, and nearly 600 of the homes destroyed since then were lost in one catastrophic blaze in and around Bastrop, near , that raged out of control Tuesday for a third day. Whipped into an inferno by Tropical Storm Lee's winds over the weekend, the blaze burned...

September 6, 2011 Gov. Rick Perry held a press conference in the Austin community of Steiner Ranch Tuesday morning, thanking fire professionals for their help in trying to contain the wildfires throughout central Texas for the past two days. Perry took an aerial tour of fire damage in Steiner Ranch. He took off by helicopter from Steiner Ranch Elementary School. The Steiner Ranch fire damaged or destroyed 54 homes. It burned 125 acres. Five firefighters suffered injuries fighting the flames. All of them have since been treated and released. Perry said there have been 3.6 million acres burned by wildfires in Texas, and about 1000 homes destroyed, since the wildfire season began in December 2010. The Governor says there is still a lot of work ahead.

Journalist Forrest Wilder Reports on Texas Wildfires, Severe Drought and Climate Change

Author: democracynow


DemocracyNow.org - Texas Gov. Rick Perry was back on the campaign trail at last night's Republican presidential debate, where he questioned the science behind human-caused global warming. On Wednesday, Perry announced he was returning home to focus on a historic wildfire season in which some 3.6 million acres have burned — an area larger than the size of Connecticut. Perry has used the crisis to complain the federal government is not acting fast enough to assist firefighters, but critics have been quick to note the governor has slashed the budget for the Texas Forest Service, the first line of fire defense for most of the state. The wildfires come amidst a record drought. The state has seen its driest consecutive months since record-keeping began in 1895, and the impact on the state's agricultural industry has been devastating. Democracy Now! speaks with Forrest Wilder, reporter with The Texas Observer. His latest article on this is "Texas' Permanent Drought: Our water deficit didn't start with this drought. And it won't end with this drought."

A massive wildfire burning in Texas has killed two people and grown to 34000 acres, officials said Tuesday. The two people found dead Tuesday were residents who remained in an evacuated neighborhood and were discovered by sheriff's deputies patrolling burned areas in Bastrop County, said Sissy Jones, a Bastrop County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman. "We're evacuating well ahead of the fires, and unfortunately we just have residents who refuse to leave their homes," Jones said. Bastrop County Emergency Management Coordinator Mike Fisher said in a briefing that firefighters have made some progress in containing the blaze, but did not provide a containment figure. ﻿Fisher said he was satisfied with the resources in place to battle the blaze, including the 336 firefighters currently working in 12-hour shifts. But earlier Tuesday, the Texas Forest Service said it was requesting 300 to 400 additional firefighters from state and local agencies to assist in the effort. Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald said that FEMA officials were in the county Tuesday morning to begin surveying damage. The quick-moving fire would have overwhelmed any number of personnel in place when it broke out, Fisher said. The fire was "absolutely beyond our control, or anyone's control," he said. On Sunday, a separate fire burning in the East Texas town of Gladewater killed a 20-year-old woman and her 18-month-old daughter, after trapping them inside their home. That fire was eventually extinguished <b>...</b>

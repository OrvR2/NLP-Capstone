PITTSBURGH — Education Secretary Arne Duncan set out Wednesday on a three-day bus tour across the Rust Belt manufacturing region. His message is that education can help revitalize the economy in distressed areas that had been dominated by industries such as coal, steel and the production of cars.
Duncan was met by a marching band at an elementary school in Pittsburgh. He used the setting to showcase how teachers' unions have collaborated with district managers to improve education.
At a stop at an early learning center in Erie, Pa., Duncan said in tough times there's even more of a need to invest in education. Later, he planned to meet with faith leaders in Cleveland.
His bus tour also will take him to Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin.

David Bromwich: Obama, Incorporated


							            							            There are two traits conspicuous in Obama no matter what the pressure of the occasion: He rarely explains complex matters with a complexity equal to the subject matter; and he hates to be a bearer of bad news.							        



 






Arianna Huffington: Announcing HuffPost Education: Turning a Spotlight on America's Education Moment


							            							            Spurred by Waiting for "Superman," America is having an Education Moment.  And we have launched a new section: HuffPost Education.							        



 










Timothy Geithner, Sec. Arne Duncan and Valerie Jarrett: Using Education to Cope With a Complex Economy


							            							            Beyond financial reform, we must encourage all Americans -- especially our youth -- to cultivate adequate individual financial literacy to succeed in this increasingly complex, fast-moving economy.							        



 






Sec. Arne Duncan: Campus Protests Should Remind Us All of College's Value


							            							            The cost of college should never discourage anyone from going after a valuable degree. And helping America's students pursue their education should always trump bankers in pursuit of profits.							        



 










Sec. Arne Duncan, Angel Gurría and Fred van Leeuwen: Uncommon Wisdom on Teaching


							            							            Increasing teacher autonomy and participation in reform is vital not just to improving student outcomes but to elevating the teaching profession. We reject the prevailing wisdom that it can't be done.							        



 






Arn Tellem: Graduated Incomes


							            							            I agree with Arne Duncan that graduation rates should have a direct bearing on a school's NCAA tournament eligibility. But the rates should be even higher than the figure he tossed out.

				Don't send him on a tour advocating the importance of investing in education (something he knows little to nothing about).  Fire him.

Then appoint Diane Ravitch, and send her on a tour advocating the importance of investing in education (something she actually knows about).

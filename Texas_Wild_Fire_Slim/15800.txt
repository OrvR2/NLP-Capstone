Firefighters gain some control over deadly Texas blazeBy Karen Brooks | Reuters – Wed, Sep 7, 2011

BASTROP, Texas (Reuters) - Firefighters gained ground for the first time on Wednesday against a deadly wildfire raging near Austin that has destroyed more homes than any other blaze in Texas history, officials said.
The 34,356-acre Bastrop County Complex fire, which has forced the evacuation of 5,000 people, was about 30 percent contained. The fire has claimed 785 homes, the Texas Forest Service reported, and killed two people.
County officials have given a lower number for homes destroyed. Fire service officials said they were not sure why there was a discrepancy but that assessments were continuing.
Firefighters who have fought the blaze, which stretches 24 miles long and 20 miles wide at its thickest point, since Sunday have been helped in the last two days by decreased winds and cooler temperatures, officials said.
All of that is cold comfort to William Clements. He learned Tuesday that his home in Bastrop was lost. "It was kind of a shock when we came up and saw that it was gone," he said. "But we are recovering from the shock, and landing on our feet."
Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst, visiting the command center as Governor Rick Perry was in California preparing for his first Republican presidential debate, said he would ask the federal government to declare the state a disaster area.
Wildfires sweeping across drought-stricken Texas have destroyed more than 1,000 homes and forced thousands of evacuations in the last several days.
More than 3.6 million acres in Texas have been scorched by wildfires since November, fed by a continuing drought that has caused more than $5 billion in damage to the state's agricultural industry and that shows no sign of easing.
A list of 243 homes confirmed destroyed was posted for Bastrop residents to check at the county's shelters and in a command center, but it only accounted for a fraction of the houses officials say have been burned.
Resident Geary Garton, his arms covered with bandages and his nose and ears blistered, was cheerily hopeful as he approached the list looking for his house.
RESIDENTS CHECK LIST
Garton said he'd left his home on foot to find a hose on Sunday night when the fires were coming. When he turned back to douse his home with water, fire was blocking him.
"It didn't look all that bad at first, but it came up quick," he said, adding that he had sprinted back through blinding smoke to reach his two dogs, the heat blistering his arms as he ran.
His dogs, Berkley and Clancy, were hiding under the porch, which was untouched by flames. But Garton was too weak to pick them up and had to leave them behind. He expressed hope that they had escaped and would turn up at a shelter.
Then he turned his attention to the list, reading the street names. When he got to K C Drive he stopped talking. He whipped off his glasses, turned on his heel, and wiped his eye as he strode away into the parking lot. He didn't answer questions about whether his home had survived.
The U.S. Forest Service has sent a team to the area to help coordinate, and Federal Emergency Management Agency officials were on the ground assessing the damages.
Also assisting were about 100 members of Texas Task Force 1, an elite wide-area search team that will be combing "every inch" of the enormous fire zone, said Mike Fisher, the county's emergency management coordinator.
"Essentially, the mission is to find whatever's out there that we need to deal with," he said. "If we have environmental hazards out there, ecohazards out there, dead animals."
The team was used in New York City after the September 11, 2001, attacks and after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
A DC-10 air tanker capable of carrying 12,000 gallons of retardant to drop onto the flames -- four times the normal capacity for retardant bombers -- landed in Austin on Tuesday and will fly on Friday after a federally mandated break.
It had not yet been determined whether the DC-10 would be used in Bastrop or sent to other sites in Texas.
So far, four people have died in the Labor Day weekend fires, including a mother and infant daughter who died in northeast Texas on Sunday.
Officials identified one of the two dead from the Bastrop fire as Michael Troy Farr, a 48-year-old City of Austin employee found dead in his home in Smithville. Officials released no details on how he died or information on the second victim, found several miles away.

Governor Perry allows Legislatures to vote to fund 1/4 of state budget to WELFARE that senator dan patrick calls healthcare. Texas legislatures cut fire budget, education budget.
 TEXAS allows the Medicaid Waiver Program to WASTE our tax dollars

Fire Fighters cfouldnt get near the fire due to winds from the hurricane, it was too dangerous, thats why they focused on evacuation. Out of 1400 homes lost, only two people died. Thats pretty awesome compared to how many could have died. ANd for those that say Texans are uneducated, we have low ranking school system because illegals cant speak english and we have a lot of them, its illegal to deport them unless they commit a crime, thanks Bama

Has God told Michele Bachmann why he is burning down Texas yet? 
Maybe God is telling us that Rick Perry is not listening to the people? 
Just like the hurricane and tornado whisper God gave her the scope on last week.
But be careful Michele, Rick Perry can summon a gathering of Christian Prophecy Seers. They are at his counsel and they can tell you which Demons are sleeping with what Emperors and all about God’s secret alliance with Hitler.
It will be good to have God whisperers in government again won’t it?

What all you Texas haters dont understand is that we can handle more adversity than anyone else on our planet.

The firefighters of Bastrop received just as much training as paid firefighters, dry conditions and wind from the hurricane made it impossible to fight a fire in thick pine forest.  Tired of people speculating that someone is to blame for how many houses burned, my house is goine but I understand fully that they did the best they could.

This is what happens when your primary first line of defense in these rural areas is nothing but an ALL Volunteer Fire Dept.

and so now you've got what you paid for Texas.

The TEXAS fires and drought are hurting many people. Whether one is a believer or not does not negate God's Word and it needs no debate. Believers stand on what the Word says. PROVERBS 17:5 "...He who rejoices at calamity will not go unpunished".  Texans need compassion and care, not ridicule and ugly talk. This is not the time to "throw darts" at anyone. People are suffering so put aside your darts and nasty remarks and show some kindness and consideration lest worse come to your doorstep. Again heed the Word "PROVERBS 26:27 "He who digs a pit will fall into it"

according to people in the area.. it is fema who is the Problem.. butting in and "forcing local volunteer firemen & farmers to stand-down"...  some farmers had already been successful with using traditional fire break methods, on their own property.. then comes the control freak power grabbing feds.. No, no, no fire breaks.. you can only squirt water at the fires...ps,,Texans would be better off without fema-squirt's "help".

Glad Texas firefighters are getting the job done in spite of Rick Perry's massive cuts to firefighters in the great state of Texas.

I'm an Obama supporter. Despise the T Partay and am not a huge fan of repubs (I did vote Reagan twice though).

It's a stone tragedy what is happening in TX. 

Perry accepted stimulus and made TX. govt. bigger while private sector jobs continued to lose employment. Then? Moans about a failed stimulus  and big govt.. Conservatives want to smash the EPA, Education dept...FIMA and many more safety net programs. 

Thanks goodness that the T-Pubs(as I affectionately call them) have not got their claws into the FIMA agency.

Texans will get what they deserve. Help to rebuild their lives that have been tragically dismantled.

Think about it?

Everything you own burns. Your brother and his family died in their house fire as well. The family pet is nowhere to be found. The children are scared to death. Maybe their friends have died as well. Your unemployed.

Now? You get no money or relief of any kind to help you pick up the pieces. A life destroyed through no fault of your own. You must rely on charity..Like from the church..That also burned down.

Because of cuts to the fire dept and police? The fire rages on unless other states rescue the state of TX. That takes a lot of time to organize.  It has burned an area the size of CT. and we are just now getting a plane to help?

Here's my point.

I would bet all the money in TX. that the Tpubs don't change their minds about their policies one bit.

THAT is the problem. Despite the obvious? Ideology will allow history to repeat despite clear factual evidence that their policy being wrong and short sighted....How much money is one life worth? Now multiply that by all those that have perished. Now shall we cut FIMA because we don't have the money. Cut police and fire for the same reason? Get my point?

Now let's talk about the trickle down theory....

I don't believe in God but I know a lot of Texans do so...

God bless Texas in this time of need. I will hit my knees tonight just for you guys. Just this once.

I know liberals are hoping and wishing for all of us to die in Texas. That is fine, we are a tough group of folks and we will be fine. A lot of folks have been seriously hurt (I know this brings tears of joy to most liberals) but our fire fighters are doing a great job and they are now getting most of them under control! Prayers and best wishes to all affected by these horrible fires!!

think Obama is going to come tour Texas,hell no hes to scared to  Hell go to New Jersey and New York But come to us down here who speak our minds and who have priduced more jobs than he has He will just forget us
If not for Perry fighitng the goverment to get fema money for these folks who have lost everything they would be forgotten by the goverment and told to fend for yourself
So if you want to bad mouth us Texans you need to get your facts straight. Femajust sent money to the hurricane hit north east and just now has acknowledged the wildfires here.

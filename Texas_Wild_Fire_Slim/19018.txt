Love this outfit, think Emma has a classic style with a nice twist. Love her hair short, short hair is consider by men to be sexy (the Japanese consider the back of the neck very sexy). I look forward to seeing Emma's career go in other directions now that her Harry Potter movies are done.

"Harry Potter" hottie Emma Watson channeled her inner punk upon arriving at the GQ Men of the Year Awards in London. The 21-year-old actress -- who's become quite the fashionista in recent years -- rocked the red carpet in a $750, tartan McQ mini, cropped biker jacket, and studded leather pumps, courtesy of Christian Louboutin.

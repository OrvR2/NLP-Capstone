NFL Predictions Week 1: Why Tony Romo Will Lead Cowboys over New York Jets



 
 Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images Tony Romo and the Dallas Cowboys are always in the spotlight, that's what happens when you are America's team. However, this season the Cowboys are flying a bit under the radar, and that could be a blessing in disguise.After an abysmal season in 2010, with a large part of that because of Tony Romo's injury which limited him to very few games played, the Cowboys are facing the normal high expectations but are not the focus of the national media.Going into Giants stadium to face the New York Jets in the season opener, the Cowboys have a great chance to make a statement against a premier AFC team on national television.This season, Romo will be looking to prove he is an elite quarterback in the NFL, and that he can win playoff games.To get to the playoffs, you must beat quality teams like the Jets in the regular season. Romo has a ton of weapons to use on offense, including playmakers returning from injury in wide receiver Dez Bryant and Felix Jones.Romo will use the speed of Bryant, Jones, and receiver Miles Austin to attack the Jets secondary and spread the ball around.The Cowboys defense is hurting a bit in the secondary, but have a solid group of pass rushers led by DeMarcus Ware who will get after Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez, who has to develop chemistry with several new receivers.Romo could be facing a make or break season in Dallas, because if the Cowboys don't make a deep playoff run, Romo could be traded or cut.Romo and the Cowboys will shock the NFL and upset the New York Jets and their fiery and cocky coach Rex Ryan.

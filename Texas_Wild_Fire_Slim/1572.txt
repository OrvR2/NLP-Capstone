Did the media ignore lack of applause at Obama’s Navy Yard speech?By Dylan StablefordSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford | The Cutline – 13 hrs ago


Did the news media expose its liberal bias by ignoring a clip of a group of naval officers who needed to be instructed to applaud President Barack Obama? That's what several conservative pundits are asking, after a video of the incident in early August surfaced this week.
As Obama was introduced at the Washington Navy Yard on Aug. 5, he approached the podium to "Hail to the Chief." The assembled officers did not applaud. The senior officer who introduced the president, sensing the awkward silence, said, "You can go ahead and cheer, too." The crowd, some of who were taking photos, dutifully clapped hands.

"Perhaps it's protocol not to cheer until told to when in the military," Ben Howe, a blogger for RedState.com, wrote. "But if that's true, the media has some explaining to do as to why they went after Bush for the same thing in 2005."
Howe is referring to how the national news media covered a similar incident in June of that year, when President George W. Bush gave a speech at Fort Bragg and applause was initiated by a White House staff member.
As Howe noted, Terry Moran, reporting for ABC News, said at the time, "I must tell you that applause was initiated by a member of the White House advance team."
On NBC, Brian Williams said, "Some folks at home no doubt were curious about the lack of applause breaks. By pre-agreement between the White House and Fort Bragg, there was no entry applause as the soldiers were at attention. We were 23 minutes into it before the first break for applause."
"It was my observation that that one applause break was actually triggered by members of the president's advance team," NBC's Kelly O'Donnell told Williams. "They were just a few feet from me. They started to applaud— applause is contagious, and it then swept through the room. There was applause when the president left the room after the speech was over but people in uniform here told me that they had planned to be polite and to follow protocol."
But even if the Naval officers were following protocol, Howe wrote, "it's media bias on display."
"How come that bit of tape isn't by now famous?" Washington Post columnist Erik Wemple asked. "Why hasn't it been chewed over by every cable news outlet in the land?"
Perhaps it's because on Aug. 5, the cable news outlets were focused on the stock market's 513-point plunge.
As The Cutline noted that day, "cable and network news channels scrambled to cover the historic drop, with ABC, NBC and CBS breaking into their afternoon programming to air brief reports after the markets closed, and CNBC and Fox Business--which went commercial-free to cover the close--planning special primetime coverage."

In 67 yrs. of living and voting, I have never seen so much disrespect accorded a president.  Even the worst of them all, Nixon, was treated with respect as he left the white house in utter disgrace.

You people are full of it. As a military vet, when the Commander in Chief comes in, you stand at attention. Overseas, this man puts his country first. Bin Ladden dead, Gahdafi ousted. Don't question his dedication to this country with your lame ass hatred. He has always put America first.

Correct me, if these statistics are factually wrong: 
1) Liberals tend to have higher IQs that conservatives.
2) Liberals trend toward having higher levels of education and have read more books than conservatives.
3) Liberals tend to have traveled to more foreign countries more than conservatives have.
4) Liberals have healthier eating habits, and exercise more than the typical conservative.
5) Liberals are less superstitious than conservatives.
6) Liberals are statistically less racist than conservatives.
7) There is less domestic violence in liberal homes than in conservative ones.
8) There are more bilingual and trilingual liberals than conservatives.
9)  Liberals are more likely to know hard facts about history and current events that conservatives.
10) Liberals are less likely to be religious (any religion), and tend to be more agnostic.
11) Liberals are more likely to champion rights for women, children, minorities, and homosexuals than conservatives.
12) Liberals prefer the government to spend tax revenue on more on education and health care, while conservatives tend to support subsidies for corporations and large military budgets.
13) Liberals are far less likely to take the Bible literally than conservatives.

The statistics aren't wrong.  This is what the studies say.  1+1=2, and that's just the way is.  If you can count, you can't deny this.

Frankly, after 11 years in the Navy and Marines - I know well that the Navy still has a problem with color - even though they - try to hide it.  But they also have a problem with women as well.  They have no problem sleeping with women but they do have a problem respecting them as equal service members.  If any wise ass out there wants to criticize my observations I spent 6 years as a Fleet Petty Officer  and 4 years as a Navy Intelligence Tech assigned to the Pentagon in DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) a Joint Service and Civilian Command. Total time (11 years 1979-91) So that ends that argument.
Now I will be voting for Obama - not because I agree with everyone of his policies - I don't - but because right now him and the Democrats are the only sane people in government.  I like Ron Pauls foreign policy - but I don't like his idea of ending Social Security - that's wrong, no industrial country in the world refuses to give it's citizens a social safety net - this is not 1879 - this is a high-tech post industrial world - and millions upon millions of people are not able to acquire the skills to let them stash a million dollars away to retire on.  
As far as Obama - I wish he had never run in the first place - why?  Because America is a country that has not grown up yet. We haven't even dealt with how the Native Americans were ripped off their land and were treated to genoicide - if you can't deal with that as a nation then it's obvious that the questions of slavery and race are that much more difficult to deal with.  Not to mention the fact that this country can't even deal with the blatant discrimination against women in this society - how dare do a bunch of cruddly Republicans sit around a table and decide to make huge cuts in women's health care?  That is madness.
Look you put the black guy in the White House and all he has become is the whipping boy for the GOP's failed policies and some people's bigotry and lack of education.  I can't believe some of the moronic statements that I read on this blog. This country dug it's grave before Obama was elected to the Senate - his only mistake was trying to be one of the boy's and keeping the troops in these various quagmires. Bush and Cheney opened the door - there has been enough written to see it for yourself if you wanted to. Cheney's book and Bush Jr.'s book should be used at their trials for War Crimes.  In ten years they started a train that got us into about 7 hot wars, a tax break for the rich, a giveaway for big pharmaceuticals, and God knows how many billions of stolen money in Iraq and Afghanistan before Obama even began his run for President. They just found 65 Billion that can't be accounted for from Iraq, and there's ton's more and ton's more stolen in Afghanistan.  And you want to scream at Obama for our financial problems? Obama is just a sucker that makes an easy target. You forget - you invaded a sovereign nation that didn't do a damn thing to you - that 's a war crime, not to mention Cheney wanting to torture every damn body - that's what we hung Nazi's in Nurenburg for at the end of WWII.
The bank bailout - that was Bush - the election hadn't even been held when they gave the bankers all that dough - but once again - you want to blame Obama.  Obama care - I don't like it because it wasn't Leftist enough - but what are you Righties crying about?  It is the Private Sector Insurance Companies dream - he couldn't get Medicare for all because he let you Right Wing Lunatics scare him - so what the hell are you complaining about?  Besides half of you ignoramuses already had Medicare - and you love  - well that is a government program.
Look - all you working class folks who hate Obama - go ahead vote Republican and let Perry end your Social Security and Medicare, and I am going to laugh my butt off - because you hateful - ignorant - bigoted idiots - you always  fall for the trap - you always vote against your own interests to keep someone else down.

I cannot recall any President being more shielded and protected from any negative coverage than George W. Bush. Any negative remarks at all and you would have been unpatriotic. Why this was so I still cannot understand. Entertainers were blacklisted for daring to utter anything bad about Duhbya in song or onstage. So anyone who would point out this particular incident as bias is a narrow minded, nit picking cry baby. I would think it would get boring to pick on every little thing concerning the current President after awhile. By the way, this was media coverage of said incident so your point is now moot.

Why it could be they are standing at attention....!!!  another cheap shot from Repubs...they have nothing to offer..except nasty lies...You would suffer the likes of perry, bauchman and other night riders.. to impune this man's integrity and reputation.  Nothing says more about you than the remarks you are making against a man because of his color..this is still about the black man in the white house..Make no mistake about this people judge the remark as well as the person. I am proud of  President Obama, his inate sense of right and his desire to improve the life of all people.. This hatred is a cancer .

Isn't it sad that most of this mess that was cause in America for the past decade is Presidents Bush fault. I mean come on 9/11, The economy, War etc. However, of course WHITE PEOPLE are now trying to turn the tables on Obama saying its his fault the way the economy is, when it is not just to save the  white man arse. (Obama is trying his best to clean up a WHITE MAN'S mess, Which is Bush'es). its so ironic of the fact that Black People been cleaning up after y'all mess since Slavery.

So many people so ignorant about our President.  I guess they just hate him because he is partially black.  Very sad and telling about the American Tea Party type.  No brains, no guts and no solutions.

The military does not respect this President.  They respect the office, not the person.  He has gone against the beliefs of it's members in allowing gays in the military and he wants to see less military.  Why should we respect a man that does not respect us?

Dartmouth Flood Observatory and SARWeather join GDACS as partners
Tue, 23 Aug 2011 00:00:00 GMT The Dartmouth Flood Observatory has been providing daily updates on flood emergencies worldwide since 2009, and has now been accepted as a GDACS partner. The moderated media-based flood list is an essential GDACS product, since no global flood monitoring system based on physical measurements or models exists for the moment. Several GDACS partners are collaborating to create such systems.

SARWeather  provides local weather forecasts for disaster areas. Experimental products have been delivered in 2010. These forecasts will become available more frequently from now on in the Virtual OSOCC.


Cyclone season in Caribbean region: new website for authoritative warnings in Haiti
Fri, 22 Jul 2011 00:00:00 GMT Since June 2010, with a strong operational support from France, Canada, UK, and the USA, WMO has coordinated operational support to the National Meteorological Services of Haiti for provision of tropical Cyclone warnings and other meteorological forecasts and information, through a public site of the National Meteorological Service of Haiti. This site is the authoritative source of the warnings in Haiti. The official site address is: http://www.meteo-haiti.gouv.ht/

Multi hazard daily newsletter



GDACS also offers daily alerts for all disaster types
              monitored. Up to now, only earthquake alerts were available (apart
              from the RSS feeds). Since tropical cyclones, volcanoes and floods
              are not as 'sudden onset' as earthquakes, only a daily service is
              available. 

              See today's as an example.


GDACS alert feeds


The alerts published by the Global Disaster Alert
              and Coordination System can also be used in your RSS reader or on
              Google Earth. GDACS is using existing XML and content standards.

Legend
Based on the location and magnitude of the disasters and the local population
        and their vulnerability, disasters are classified in three classes: 

 Green: very
          low likelihood of humanitarian disaster
 Orange: potential
          humanitarian disaster
 Red: very high
          likelihood of humanitarian disaster
        

How to use GDACS alerts
The events listed on this page have been automatically selected by a
        computer program based on the earliest available information; alert levels
        will not be modified manually. However, if new information comes available
        alert levels are updated automatically. For confirmation or further information
        of the disaster, please refer

to the “coordination” section of GDACS
          (OCHA Virtual OSOCC and ReliefWeb), 
to the media 
and – most importantly – to the local disaster response authority.

GDACS does not provide authoritative information. Please do not use GDACS
        alerts for emergency response decision making without alternate sources
        of information. If you are an emergency manager, please register for
        GDACS coordination (Virtual OSOCC).

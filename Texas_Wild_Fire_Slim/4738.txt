On a particularly hot July day this summer, my air
conditioning stopped working. I’m not particularly handy around the house, but
with a quick Web search, I was able to diagnose the problem. The fix: a $40
part. When the repair guy came, he confirmed my diagnosis. Then he quoted me
$535 to fix it.


That, my friends, is a ripoff. I gave back his quote and
kept my dignity.
I wish all ripoffs were so obvious. They’re not. In fact,
you’re getting duped just as badly every day and don’t realize it. It happens
at the lunch counter, in the supermarket, at the restaurant . . . anywhere
“healthy” foods are sold. 

Fact is, many supposed diet foods are more likely to add fat
to your body than to strip it away. And they generally cost more! That’s why Eat
This, Not That! has been on a crusade
against diet-food ripoffs. Click to discover the worst offenders—and learn the
simple swaps that will help you melt away belly fat fast.Click here to see the 8 Diet Food Ripoffs.

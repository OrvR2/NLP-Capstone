Sarah Palin is offering a new point of view when it comes to American history.The former Alaska Governor was in Boston on Thursday... as part of her bus tour.During a stop, she told reporters that Paul Revere's historic midnight ride from Boston to Lexington during the Revolutionary War....complete with bells... was actually meant to warn the  British.

Here is a good one that actually matters:
"First time I saw 10th Mountain Division, you guys were in southern Iraq. When I went back to visit Afghanistan, you guys were the first ones there. I had the great honor of seeing some﻿ of you because a comrade of yours, Jared Monti, was the first person who I was able to award the Medal of Honor to who actually came back and wasn’t receiving it posthumously."
Except he DID receive it posthumously.
Oh, and that was President Urkel. What a buffoon.

I must say your all doing an excellent job of some wicked bell ringing while firing off a﻿ lot of nonsensical warning shots yourselves. Your all acting like some elitist﻿ lynch mob.They all﻿ made gaffes. Obama's 57 states, Corpsmen, Hirohito gaffes...Bush's nuculars.. Quayle's Potatoes, the list goes on.﻿ Hear﻿ a real gaffe artist at work, see Biden's bloopers, a certified crowned gaffe king, They're politicians. Debate todays issues not how she eats pizza or if Revere rang his bells. Good grief!

Sara Palin was right about Paul Revere -US News and World Report
Historians agree: Palin was right about Paul Revere - American Thinker
You know how Sarah Palin said Paul Revere warned the British? Well, he did. Now, who looks stupid? -﻿ LA Times
The media ride of Sarah Palin--The left does not revere history - Washington Times
How Accurate Were Palin's Paul Revere Comments? (professor says she got it right) - NPR
Letter from Paul Revere to Jeremy Belknap, circa 1798 - Revere's words. Google it

Instead of focusing on Sarah's accurate, though poorly "prepared" remarks in this video, one may want to focus on something a little more relevant and important. In youtube just search this: UNBELIEVABLE OBAMA GAFFES, Mistakes, Lies, and Confusion
Most of these are much worse, and when he was either specifically giving a PREPARED speech or otherwise in a﻿ position specifically designed for him to speak. And they are much worse, and one needent twist his meaning to see it.

@ProtossValor7 "we could always show ppl on the streets﻿ our discussion and guess whos thing would sound the stupidest. "
You mean the people who voted for president Urkel. Mr "57 states"? Mr the Japanese dropped "the bomb" on Pearl Harbor. I didn't think he could possibly win the presidency because he could not string together two cohesive sentences on the fly. It was genius of his handlers to surgically attache a teleprompter to him and changed the world. :)
Sarah is always speaking naturally

@ProtossValor7 "DO NOT INSULT OTHERS TO TRY TO FORCE OPINIONS ON OTHERS!!! "
That's good advice. Many here should take it. When I insult others it is supported by facts and information. If I say a man who has proven he cannot play basketball cannot play basketball, and I list the facts to back it up, I am not so much insulting him. I am making a statement of fact. Here is an insult:﻿ "This is more of a glimpse. A glimpse into the chimpanzee brain of Sarah Palin." Arrogant ignorance on parade.

@ProtossValor7 "Calling ppl who disagree with you buffoons is simply﻿ asking for trouble and closes discussions into mindless rants."
Not all people who disagree with me are buffoons. But those here that still stick to the absurd notion that she did not know what she was talking about are. It is also a small window into why we have the people in gov. positions we do. Some of these buffoons vote.

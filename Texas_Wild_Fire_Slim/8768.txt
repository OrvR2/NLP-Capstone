Bank Bucks Trend, Offers Juicy 6.1% YieldBy Zacks.com | Forbes – Tue, Aug 30, 2011




Related ContentBank Bucks Trend, Offers Juicy 6.1% Yield


FNFG recently delivered better than expected second quarter  results, prompting analysts to raise their estimates for both 2011 and  2012. It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy).
Unlike most bank stocks, First Niagara held its dividend steady  throughout the financial crisis and has raised it twice in the last  year. It currently yields a juicy 6.1%.
Valuation looks very attractive too with shares trading at just 8.7x  12-month forward earnings, a significant discount to the industry  average.
First Niagara Financial operates 346 bank branches across  Upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts. It is  headquartered in Buffalo, New York and has a market cap of $3.1 billion.
Second Quarter Results
First Niagara reported better than expected results for the second  quarter on July 21. Earnings per share came in at $0.25, a penny ahead  of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It was a 14% increase over the same  quarter in 2010.
Total revenue jumped 30% to $291.3 million, due in large part to an  acquisition. The company did experience stellar 17% organic growth in  commercial loans and 22% organic growth in core deposits.
Average total loans and leases increased 9% year-over-year, excluding  those added from the acquisition. The net interest margin, which is  essentially the spread between the interest the bank takes in from loans  and what it pays out in deposits, declined 15 basis points from the  previous quarter, however, to 3.65%.
Credit quality remained among the industry's best. Net charge-offs  represented just 0.20% of average loans in the second quarter, down from  0.41% in the same quarter in 2010. Non-performing loans represented  just 0.51% of total loans in the second quarter, down from 0.74%.
Outlook

Following solid second quarter results, analysts revised their estimates higher for  both 2011 and 2012, sending the stock to a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy).
Analysts expect First Niagara to grow its EPS both through continued  organic growth and through acquisitions. On July 31, First Niagara  announced that it was acquiring 195 Upstate New York and Connecticut  branches and $15.0 billion of deposits from HSBC Bank USA, N.A.
First Niagara expects to have approximately $38 billion in assets, $30  billion in deposits and 450 branches across Upstate New York,  Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, upon completion of the  acquisition.
Based on consensus estimates, analysts project 20% EPS growth for First Niagara in 2011 and 18% growth in 2012.

Dividend
In addition to this growth, FNFG pays a dividend that yields a  stellar 6.1%. Unlike many banks during the financial crisis, First  Niagara did not cut its dividend and has actually raised its dividend  twice in the last year. Dating back to 2000, it has increased its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 17.5%:

Valuation
Although First Niagara seems to stand above the problems plaguing the  banking industry, shares got pummelled in the recent market sell off as  investors fled financial stocks en masse.

This appears to be an overreaction, however, given First Niagara's excellent credit quality and solid growth prospects.

Valuation looks compelling with shares trading at just 8.7x 12-month  forward earnings, a discount to the industry average of 13.0x and its  10-year median of 16.0x.
Its price to book ratio is just 0.5, well below the industry average of 0.8.
The Bottom Line
While the banking industry may still be reeling from the lingering  effects of the housing crash and financial crisis, First Niagara has  bucked the trend and continues to lend while maintaining sterling credit  quality. With double-digit EPS growth forecasts and a solid 6.1%  dividend yield, shares look like a bargain at just 8.7x forward  earnings.

        China’s state media on Friday reported to have accused Western countries of “double standards” in their fight against terrorism, ahead of the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The comment piece by the official Xinhua news agency blamed Washington in particular for turning a “blind eye” to the damage caused by extremists in Russia’s Chechnya and in China’s own far-western region of Xinjiang.  The United States refused to repatriate the Uighurs on the basis they would face almost certain precautions.  Uighurs populates the Xinjiang region, which has experienced several outbreaks of ethic violence in recent years- much of which Beijing has blamed on extremism, separatism and terrorism.        1 of 3

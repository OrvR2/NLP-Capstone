Although Tinseltown may have head cruel intentions in store for Reese Witherspoon -- a typical Hollywood ending to a typical Hollywood romance -- she's back on top and feeling lucky. 
"I got lucky. I did. I got very lucky, and he's so wonderful with the children," Witherspoon told Marie Claire of her new husband, Jim Toth. "I'm very blessed."
But things weren't always so peachy for the mother of two. After eight years of marriage -- and two kids later -- Witherspoon split from her first husband, Ryan Phillippe in 2008. Although the divorce only further catapulted her into the top spot of America's reigning sweetheart, it also landed her on the receiving end of much unwanted publicity surrounding her love life, especially her relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal. Although it seems that Witherspoon is now laughing off her past heartbreak -- she recently had lunch with Taylor Swift to dish on their mutual ex, Gyllenhaal. 
But Witherspoon's newfound freedom from the stress of being a single mom wasn't an overnight fix. 
"I was hard on myself when I got divorced. And until I got remarried, I don't think I realized how stressed I was," she told the magazine. "I feel so much relief. I don't think I realized how stressed I was being a single parent. It was really, really stressful. It's not easy on anybody."

Read Witherspoon's full interview when Marie Claire's October issue hits stands on September 20th.

The comedian will officially host the 84th Academy Awards. This is Murphy's first time hosting the esteemed awards show. 
"I am enormously honored to join the great list of past Academy Award hosts from Hope and Carson to Crystal, Martin and Goldberg, among others," said Murphy.  "I'm looking forward to working with Brett and Don on creating a show that is enjoyable for both the fans at home and for the audience at the Kodak Theatre as we all come together to celebrate and recognize the great film contributions and collaborations from the past year."

Marty Kaplan: The Hollywood Candidate Is Not Obama


							            							            His persona, and the story he is telling, and the media narrative that frames and delivers it to us, all come straight from the movies.  Unfortunately, this movie may end really, really badly.
							        



 






Scott Mendelson: Paranormal Activity 2 Scores Record $40.6 Million; Hereafter Nets $12 Million; Holdovers Hold Strong -- Weekend Box Office Review


							            							            Costing just $3 million, the Paramount sequel to Paranormal Activity capitalized on the much-buzzed about original, which had a stunningly successful platform release over last September and October.							        



 






Marty Kaplan: The Real Shakedown to Apologize for


							            							            Because our system requires campaign airtime be paid for by candidates rather than provided for free, we practically guarantee that candidates will be vulnerable to pressure from special interests.							        



 






Iris Mack: Bob Rubin Just Wants to Be Cuddled


							            							            When Bob Rubin and I reached the hotel entrance, the tension returned. He got this funny look on his face, and asked: "Do you want to go upstairs and... cuddle?"							        



 






Joel Schwartzberg: Inspiration or Wince-piration: What Will Kid Movies Be Based on Next?


							            							            "Lunchables: The Movie": When a tray of lunchables is micro-waved by accident, the ingredients magically come to life and must save a sexy "Lean Cuisine" from the PG-13 desires of "Hungry Man." 							        



 






Jennifer Weiner: To Boldly Go...Backwards


							            							            I didn't have a problem until about midway through Star Trek, at which point I realized that every single lady on screen was either a mother, a ho, or an intergalactic hood ornament. 							        



 






Tallulah Morehead: Oscar Wild


							            							            Could we just keep Tina Fey and Steve Martin, and send everyone else home? "Don't fall in love with me," said Martin. Sorry, Steve. You're 35 years too late.							        



 






Eric Deggans: One Reason Race May Not Derail Obama: The 'Do the Right Thing' Effect


							            							            It's something people of color face every day: you're a symbol to the world until you get famous enough that you're not.

Are they trying to get black audiences to tune in to see more white actors win oscars...f­or an entire 4 hours? 

No. Thanks.

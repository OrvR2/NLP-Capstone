@tonyls09 You make it sound like the dead man in his bathtub fell from a passing plane and just happened to land where he did. What an idiot you are. Brett was playing sick, and stupid games and it killed someone. You are a sicko too or you would not defend him.﻿

@bicarbonate18 I﻿ see, so, you have no sadness for the person that died as a result of his either evil intentions or irresponsible behavior, you are just sad that we all noticed he killed someone. You must play some real mental gymnastics to keep from seeing what YOU are all about.

@Mercedes666metal A wonderful man.....surrrrrrreeee he is. He is wonderful at hiding his true self from the world, but the mask has slipped. You are just a fool that﻿ was fooled.

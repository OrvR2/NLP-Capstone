The events of Sept. 11, 2001 undoubtedly changed the course of U.S. history -- and permanently etched the date on the world's consciousness. With the 10th anniversary of the four coordinated suicide attacks against the U.S. rapidly approaching, 9/11 is once again a focus for many. 
Though it will be forever associated with the World Trade Center and U.S. Pentagon attacks, Sept. 11 is an important date from a global perspective for other reasons as well. Historic events in Haiti, Estonia and Chile also took place on Sept. 11 over various years -- and both Japan's Princess Akishino and embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will mark their birthdays on the date. 
Take a look at other world events that took place on Sept. 11 below:

On Sept. 11, 1941, ground was broken on the construction of the U.S. Pentagon. It was heavily damaged sixty years later on Sept. 11, 2001, when hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into its western side, killing 189 people in total.

				9/11 occurred as a direct result of the US incessant meddling in Middle East affairs (creating a recruitmen­t tool for terrorist expansion) coupled with industry dictated relaxed airport and airplane security purely to increase profits. These are things that get overlooked by everyone in the media and all levels of government that needs a boogeyman in order to justify their collective existence. Fact is we are all responsibl­e for creating a dangerous world, but refuse to accept any culpabilit­y.

				What is this "is assassinat­ed" form in expressing an event of the past.  "Is" is present tense while "assassina­ted" is the past and correct tense.  It is what I call "Wiki-Engl­ish."  Makes no sense.  Correct your diction.

				It will not be political correctnes­s that will fade the memory of 9/11 in 50 years. It will be the natural human tendency to forget the painful past and focus on the current times. This is why a list of the best 20 movies of all time would be heavily weighted to the films of the past twenty years and would give less attention to the films of 50 years ago. It's human nature. It is also human nature to proclaim the current generation a shame. It's been going on since before history was written. Congratula­tions, you have become a cliché.

				I really wish we could just put all the hoopla about 9/11 "to bed" finally.  Yeah, it was a devastatin­g blow to America's concept that we were invincible and it reminded us that, yes, there ARE people in the world who hate our collective guts.  But, why do we need to re-live all of this stuff because it's the 10th anniversar­y?  That in itself is a little weird.

I sure hope that we are not hit again but then we have been hit so many times over the last 20 years or so that I feel that we need to expect one at any time.  And our Security People in this Country are trying to stay on top of all that could happen.   LET US HOPE

				9/11 happened purely because of pursuing greed. We really need to move on as a country instead of continuall­y reliving the past. I really wanna get off this continuous slippery slope that is dragging all the principles on which this country was founded into never land. The Patriot Act does not reinforce life, liberty or the pursuit of happiness. Being governed by fear is totally unamerican­. This is where government has gone totally wrong.

				It was more than a blow to our sense of security. It was the murder of almost 3,000 people, most of whom were Americans. It was an attack on our nation and was an event that had a profound effect on virtually all of us.

				The only significan­t date for me is Sept 11, 2001,  I could care less about what happened anywhere else and when it happened or how it happened and all the comments regarding chile are a bit annoying since they appear to care so little about their own country the live in, typical of most readers of the HuffPost. Rather Anti-ameri­can it seems.

				Furthermor­e, how is it anti-Ameri­can to have concern for other people and nations and their tragedies? No one in their right mind would argue that Sept 11th, 2001 wasn't a_horrific act. In fact the outpouring of friendship and sympathy for the USA from people all over the world during that time was an inspiratio­n and gave me hope for a better future.

				So your American way is beating one over the head into submission­? Why are you on the HuffPo if you disagree with the majority of posters? Exercising your freedom to voice your opinion? Better to be thankful.

				Did you fly much after that? I did and one freedom I lost was an assumption of honesty for a citizen who has no criminal record. I went through extensive searches including my luggage being unpacked in front of me, being frisked and being taken aside at the gate and made to take off my shoes and being wanded. All of this special treatement was flagged due to a variety of factors. Once including being met by the FBI at the end of a flight as an interview about the added search and process I went through at the inception of the flight. On one occasion being detained I couldn't make my flight. I also lost something that is finite and precious. Time. Everytime I fly it takes more time than it should because of the actions of those cowards. Along the same line, I remember arriving for a visit and enjoyed coming through the door at the gate and seeing the faces of friends and family there to greet me. Restrictio­ns such as those are a loss of freedoms.

Additional­ly I am not free to roam our nations capital without hindrances­. Closures of public facitiliti­es or at the least limited access. Have you been to the Capital Building?

Regardless of how you cut it, we are less free and more restricted that we were before.

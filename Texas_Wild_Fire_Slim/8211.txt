Palestinian militant killed in Gaza explosionBy IBRAHIM BARZAK - Associated Press | AP – 15 hrs ago





DEIR EL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The militant group Islamic Jihad says one of its armed men has been killed and another wounded in an explosion in the central Gaza Strip.Islamic Jihad spokesman Abu Ahmad says the car in which the men were traveling was hit by an Israeli airstrike. The Israeli military said it was checking the report.Islamic Jihad men who congregrated outside the hospital in Deir el-Balah late Wednesday said the militant had been involved in launching rockets.Israel regularly targets Gaza militants responsible for firing rockets. Militants have dramatically increased their arsenal and now threaten major urban centers in Israel's south.Islamic Jihad is a small faction in Gaza, ruled by the more powerful militants of Hamas.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli security forces have arrested Hamas militants accused in a bombing that killed a British woman and wounded dozens of civilians earlier this year, the country's Shin Bet security service announced Wednesday.The announcement said the militant accused of constructing the bomb, a 36-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank, was arrested along with a 23-year-old Palestinian from Jerusalem accused of planting it next to a busy bus stop in the city on March 23.The bomb killed Mary Jean Gardner, a 59-year-old British tourist studying in Jerusalem, and injured two dozen others, including five Americans.sThe man accused of planting the bomb was in possession of a second explosive device intended for use by a suicide bomber in an attack planned for Aug. 21, according to the Shin Bet statement. The new bomb was seized a day before the planned attack and the would-be suicide bomber, a 20-year-old Palestinian from Hebron, was caught two days later.The statement said that in recent months the Shin Bet had arrested "dozens" of suspected militants who belonged to Hamas networks in Jerusalem and the West Bank and operated in coordination with Hamas leaders in Gaza and Syria. Thirteen were identified in the press release.A spokesman for the Hamas military wing in Gaza had no comment.In the West Bank city of Hebron, Ali Kawasmeh, the father of Hussein Kawasmeh, accused of constructing the bomb, said his son was innocent and that Israel was "trying to punish his family." He said another son had died as a Hamas suicide bomber, two others had been killed by the military and five were in Israeli prisons.The cities of the West Bank are governed by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority under Israel's overall security control.Palestinian security services have taken on more responsibilities in recent years, including arresting Hamas members and maintaining security coordination with Israel. Israel's military, meanwhile, carries out regular arrest raids and less frequent targeted killings in the West Bank. Israel says the Palestinian Authority is not yet capable of guaranteeing Israel's security.Hamas has ruled the Gaza Strip since seizing power there from the Palestinian Authority in 2007. Militants in the territory now possess rockets capable of striking across most of southern Israel.The Palestinian Authority, frustrated by prolonged deadlock in peace talks and capitalizing on international impatience with Israel's current hardline government, is moving ahead with a plan to seek recognition of a state at the United Nations later this month. The move is opposed by Israel and the U.S., who say a Palestinian state should be created through negotiations.On Wednesday, two senior White House envoys met with Palestinian officials and tried to persuade them to drop the plan and instead resume peace talks.A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose the information, said the American envoys did raise new proposals that would enable talks to resume.In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland called the Palestinians' U.N. bid "misguided" and said the "only path" to the creation of a Palestinian state was negotiations."You can say whatever you want in the U.N, it's not going to lead to that outcome, and it could exacerbate tensions in the region, exacerbate tensions between the parties and make it harder to get back to the talks," she said._____Associated Press writers Nasser Shiyoukhi reported from Hebron, West Bank, and Bradley Klapper from Washington.

Its interesting how these Palis cry that Israel occupied the west bank and gaza. Now correct me if Im wrong but didnt Israel win the west bank from Jordan and won gaza from Egypt. So if thats the case how on earth does that belong to the palistinians?  I mean if anyone has the right to ask for their land back its Egypt and Jordan. So does this mean when the Israelis won this land during war, all of a sudden the Palis were born and Yasser Arafat the supreme Palestinian decided to start a war with the Israelis.  Oh wait a second, Yasser Arafat the fraud was actually born in Cairo Egypt so he is one of those transplanted arabs who basically got tired living in a desert and wanted to suck off the teet of the Israelis after they turned a baron wasteland into lush mangroves and watered cities.  Aha wait till a a nation builds itself up and then try to be a deadbeat and steal developed land from a civilized society.  These arabs are a waste

While I won't cheer the militant's death I can't say I feel sympathy for him or his family.

Hopefully there will be a day in the near future that will read: Gaza has been totaled by an unknown explosion. There are no survivors except young children and opponents of Hamas. No one has been able to find out how this happened but it seems like a divine intervention.

It looks like a case of premature detonation. They were probably delivering an IED to place at a civilian point and they shot their load early. Poor Pali terrorists. Now they blame the Isreali's. Par for the course.

Astronauts' tracks, trash seen in new moon photosBy SETH BORENSTEIN - AP Science Writer | AP – Tue, Sep 6, 2011
REUTERS - NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) image released on September 6, 2011 shows the Apollo 17 site on the moon, where the tracks laid down by the lunar rover are clearly visible, along with the …more  last foot trails left on the moon. The images also show where the astronauts placed some of the scientific instruments that provided the first insight into the moon's environment and interior. LRO captured the sharpest images ever taken from space of the Apollo 12, 14 and 17 landing sites. Images show the twists and turns of the paths made when the astronauts explored the lunar surface. NASA says the image brightness and contrast have been altered to highlight surface details.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A spacecraft circling the moon has snapped the sharpest photos ever of the tracks and trash left behind by Apollo astronauts in their visits from 1969 to 1972.Images taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter from 13 to 15 miles up show the astronauts' paths when they walked on the moon, as well as ruts left by a moon buggy. Experts could even identify the backpacks astronauts pitched out of their lunar landers before they returned to Earth."What we're seeing is a trail," said Arizona State University geology professor Mark Robinson, the orbiter's chief scientist. "It's totally awesome."However, the photos were not close enough to see individual bootprints, Robinson said.The pictures were taken two weeks ago and show the landing sites for Apollo 12, 14 and 17. The closest images are of the 1972 Apollo 17 site, the last moon mission.Apollo 17 Commander Eugene Cernan wrote in an email to The Associated Press that the photo gives him a chance to revisit those days, "this time with a little nostalgia and disappointment. Nostalgia because those special days are fondly etched in my memory and disappointment because it looks like now we will not be going back within the days I have left on this planet."Two years ago, images from the same spacecraft from 30 and 60 miles out showed fuzzier images. But this year the orbiter dipped down to take about 300,000 more close-ups. The trails left by the astronauts are clear, but the places where backpacks were discarded, Apollo 17's moon buggy, and the bottom parts of the three lunar landers are blurry."You have to really look at it for a long time to figure out what you're looking at," Robinson said. For example, when it comes to the moon buggy he said, "if you squint really hard you can resolve the wheels and that the wheels are slightly turned to the left."At first, scientists thought they had a bit of a mystery: They saw more stuff than they expected. It turned out to be packing material and an insulation blanket, Robinson said.After 40 years there does not seem to be much moon dust covering the manmade trails. It probably will take about 10 million to 100 million years for dust to cover them, Robinson said.The photos were released a few days after the debut of the new fictional movie "Apollo 18" and before Thursday's planned launch of NASA's twin robotic spaceships to explore the moon's gravity.___Online:NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter: http://1.usa.gov/qTrKRwArizona State University Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera page:http://www.lroc.asu.edu/

Those are DOD, Corporate-Military-Industrial-Government Complex program Mining Operation tracks made by 5 mile long mining machines/Apparatus and everyone on this thread knows it!  NASA only preempted this issue of the photos by calling them Apollo Mission leftovers to head off and forgo another awkward explanation before someone else broke the story. Notice how there are no details in the photos.  Just take their word for it!  Yes, we have had secret missions to the Moon and yes we have one or more Moon Bases(Project Luna)on the Moon, as well as, "Telescopes"/Mass Spectrometers etc.!  First, Near Roswell, we had a Military approved media report of a "Captured Disc".  Then it's a "Mylar Weather Balloon".  Then it is a Nuclear Detonation Detection, Surveilling, Monitoring, Recon Nylon Balloon Device and now it is Test Dummies dropped from 25 thousand feet-a program that did not exist until 1952.  The "Roswell Incident" occurred in 1947.  First, Pat Tillman was killed by an IED, then it's Enemy Fire, then it's Friendly Fire, now it's Negligent Friendly Fire.  He was on record before the incident as are his parents today stating:  "he was going up the "Chain of Command" to stop the practice of American Troops guarding Poppy Fields in Afghanistan";  "If that did not work, he was going to the press".  His folks state as of today:  "He was FRAGGED for pushing this issue" with the cover story as a Hero, which, indeed he was; but not to the CIA or the NRO or NSA!  See how the story keeps changing?  First there is life in Mars Rocks and Moon Rocks, then there isn't, then it is, again. "There is no Water, oh, wait a minute, now, there is!  "Nope, no water, again!"  "YES, there is Water!"  Specifically reference Moon Orbiter Clementine and the Mars Global Observer, Rovers ect. etc. etc.  "IS TOO", "IS NOT", "ARE TOO", AM NOT"!  "ARE TOO!", D2!!!!!  AND on and on we go.  If these so called "Scientists" and bureaucrats where suspects in an interrogation room, they would have been exposed, indicted, arraigned, prosecuted and convicted long ago.  Personally, I think they should all be thrown in a room and then, throw the room away. If these are examples of "Mistakes", how could the "Best and the Brightest" not get the facts straight before going with a "Story"?  At least, get the "Story" straight!

Don't tell this to any of the conspiracy freaks with 80 IQs who send me emails about fake birth certificates, a muslim president and of course.....the ubiquitous (attn people with 75 IQs- that means "all over the place")  fake moon landings.

Why do people with abnormally low IQs believe in conspiracy theories?

Can you tell me that after 42 years, those tracks are still there?  I find that hard to believe, being that the moon does rotate, and rotation is movement and object in motion stays in motion so even though there is no atmosphere to create wind, their would still be vibrations of some sort which would surly cause dust to move.  Craters not eroding in thousand of years like they do on earth,i can understand, but the moon hasn't remained as is has with every pebble it has in place since it's creation... and if is is bombarded by mertorites ocassionlly, dust would have to eventually settle over these locations some how lessening the look of these tracks, especially since the moon has a lower gravity then the earth I assume that it would take longer for the dust to fall back to the moon, and when it settled it would be in a slightly different place.  I see metorites fall through the earth atmosphere all the time, once a month I see a really awsome looking shooting star, and since the moon has no atmosphere these rocks aren't being burn't up as they hit the moon so What on MOON is going on?  These are the best photo we have had of that particular region and yet we got satillites that can pinpoint a flea on a dog from space.  Look at google earth that beast can just about get pictures are you taking a wizz by a tree,

I think that a lot of you are missing a crucial point here.  I saw one person who said trash???????????   This isn't right that we left garbage there.   Are we such a society of just throwing things away?  Why was this crap left there in the first place??  All we did was pollute the moon.

I repeat.. IF the moon landing was a hoax then WHY did the USSR keep quite! GET REAL people. Not only did they have the ability to track everything going on, intercept every transmission, AND plot its precise location... THEY (I actually name a they here...) would of known we where faking it and MOSCOW WOULD NEVER OF KEPT QUITE ON THE PROPAGANDA COUPE OF THE CENTURY!!!

there are two sets of people in the country. Those who believe the moon landings were a hoax and 9/11 was a conspiracy..........and those who believe we did land on the moon and 9/11 were acts committed against humanity by Al Qaeda. Never find one person who believes in one of those things and not the other.

The comments here are the sad reflection of a dumbed-down population who have passively allowed their minds to be filled with hatred for America, The West, Judeo-Christian World View, everything.  James' was one of the few positive comments. Notably his worldview contained a Creator.  
Secular Humanism claims to replace God with humanity as the measure of all things.  Yet, instead of assuming god-like character, we have become less human and more animal-like.  Ironic, that we who recognize the Creator in Whose image we are created, think more highly of Humanity than those who see Humanity as the supreme intelligence on Earth.  
Trash?  No, historical artifacts are a more accurate description.  
For those who either read or saw the movie Atlas Shrugged, there is a scene when Hank Reardon a genius and perfectionistic metallurgist succeeds in creating a new alloy that vastly surpasses steel in every way possible, from lighter weight, to greater strength.  Out of the first casting of what would be a historic new material, he had created a bracelet of the metal as a gift for his wife on their anniversary.  It was the fruit of years of study, research, and trial and error.  His wife scorned it as a bracelet of what will one day be car fenders.  It is this that the self-righteous comments about Man's pollution of the Moon reminds me.  
Why do those who deny God and place Man above all, seem to be the same ones who despise mankind, and seem to compete to be the most self-loathing.  (But it is really only the children brought up to believe in self-esteem as a right, and not requiring the accomplishment of estimable things, that love to point out the "awfulness" of any impact of mankind upon the "virginal" earth and moon.  This allows a sense of superiority to those who have absolutely nothing to offer the world!  Those who do have the creative intellect are despised out of petty envy, dressed up as altruist concern for the "environment".

Ask yourself two questions.. Out of all the pixs that Nasa allows the public to see, all of them are in color , from every planet, star or galaxy, EXCEPT THE MOON(its alwaYS IN BLACK AND WHITE)..2nd question, How come every picture that you see of the moon from Nasa, THERE ARE NEVER ANY STARS IN THE BACKGROUND??

spy satelites can take pictures of what you are eating and they are thousands of miles up. They can't taka a clear picture from 15 miles? I agree with Jt650, why didn.t we or anyone else go back?

I don't believe we landed anymore than I believe we did. I'm split down the middle. But how can you half wits look at this and find this as solid proof? Saying these tracks can't be faked? I'm sorry, but if we can make Keanu Reeves fly we can make a few computer generated videos... I'm not saying this is real or fake, I'm just saying people need to re-think how simple it actually might be to create this...

Hey guys.... If we faked the moon landing then why the hell didn't the Soviets blow that lid WIDE open? After all Moscow had a probe in orbit, the ability to monitor ALL outgoing and incoming transmissions, not to mention a Radar Surveillance ship parked just a hair over 12 miles away off the coast of Florida.

In 1969 there is NO way that they would play along with this! Yet on July 20th, 1969 the Soviet Union's "man to the moon" program came to a screeching halt. Explain that one please......

NASA - stands for Never A Straight Answer.  This is all so faked, if you are curious about the moon, simply google Richard C Hoagland or go to Dark Mission.com.  The stuff we get from NASA is just BS.  Dark Mission will tell you all you need to know.  By the way, we aren't the only ones interested in the moon.  There is the ESA, (European) JSA, (Japanese), and others. This is just so much BS, issued by an agency that is unparalleled in BS.

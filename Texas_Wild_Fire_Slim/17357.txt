Stosur ends Aussie drought with U.S. Open title

Posted on 09/12/2011 by admin 

NEW YORK (Reuters) – Sam Stosur became the first Australian woman in 38 years to win the U.S. Open when she upset American Serena Williams 6-2 6-3 on Sunday in an ill-tempered final.
Stosur played the match of her life to defeat the most formidable player of her generation and capture her first grand slam title, spoiling American hopes of a home-bred champion on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.
“I had one of my best days and I’m very fortunate that I had it on this stage in New York,” Stosur said during an on-court interview.
“Ever since I started playing it was a dream of mine to be here one day. I don’t really know what to say. Serena, you are a fantastic player, great champion and have done wonders for our sport.”
Williams, bidding for a fourth U.S. Open crown, failed to reproduce her best after sailing to the final without dropping a set and let her frustrations boil over.
Throughout the second set she repeatedly argued with the chair umpire in a petulant display that rekindled memories of her ungracious exit from the 2009 U.S. Open.
“If you ever see me walking down the hall, look the other way because you’re out of control,” Williams said.
While Williams berated the official, Stosur remained a model of composure. The 27-year-old dominated the match from the outset and fully deserved her win, played in front of a raucous Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd.
Stosur, one of the fittest and biggest-hitting players in the women’s game, put Williams under pressure from the outset with some thunderbolt returns that pinned the American behind the baseline and attacked her backhand, forcing her to make errors.
Stosur broke Williams’s serve twice in the first set, which she wrapped up in 31 minutes, then three times in the second while losing her own serve once.
“She played really well, she’s a great player,” Williams said. “I tried my hardest but she kept hitting winners and there was nothing I could do.”
CODE VIOLATION
Williams went into the match as the overwhelming favorite despite having not played at Flushing Meadows since her foul-mouthed tirade in 2009 that earned her a hefty fine and a two-year probation.
She was sidelined for almost a year because of health complications after she cut her foot on glass after winning at Wimbledon in 2010 and had been on her best behavior until she blew up during the second set.
She was docked a point after screaming “come on” just as Stosur was about to try and return a shot and then was given a code violation in the next game for screaming at the umpire.
“It wouldn’t have made a difference,” Williams said about the point she lost.
“Six month ago in the hospital I couldn’t even stand up, but thanks to my parents and sisters and everyone else I’m here. I’m emotional, I might start crying. I’m happy to be here, it’s really good.”
Stosur, seeded ninth, became the first Australian woman to win the U.S. Open title since Margaret Court in 1973. The last Australian woman to win any grand slam was Evonne Goolagong-Cawley at Wimbledon in 1980.
Stosur, who was better known as a doubles player, emerged as Australia’s best prospect in years when she made the final at the French Open last year but lost to Italy’s Francesca Schiavone.

Military jets escort two flights after security scares

Posted on 09/12/2011 by admin 

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – U.S. military jets were scrambled to escort two passengers flights because of security scares on Sunday as Americans marked the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks.
Two F-16 fighter jets escorted an American Airlines flight to a safe landing in New York after a report of suspicious activity on the flight from Los Angeles.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said it was notified of passengers allegedly behaving suspiciously on American Airlines Flight 34 from Los Angeles International Airport to New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.
“Out of an abundance of caution, NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) scrambled two F-16 jets to shadow the flight until it landed safely at JFK,” the agency said in a statement.
The Boeing 767-200, on a flight from Los Angeles, landed at New York’s John F. Kennedy and the passengers disembarked without incident, the airline said.
A spokeswoman for American  said the crew did not perceive a threat.
“Our captain and flight attendants did not see that there was any security issue,” Andrea Huguely told Reuters, adding that the crew and airline did not ask for assistance.
Another American Airlines spokesman confirmed that the incident began with “suspicious behavior” observed in the area of the jetliner’s lavatory.
In another incident, F-16 jets were called into action to shadow a Frontier Airlines flight to Detroit Metro Airport after the TSA was notified of passengers allegedly behaving suspiciously, the agency said.
“Law enforcement met the flight, which was brought to a remote area of the airport,” The TSA said. “The plane was swept with negative findings and cleared.”
Frontier Airlines Flight 623 from Denver landed safely in Detroit. An airline spokesman said two passengers had been seen to be spending “an extraordinarily long time in the lavatory” and three passengers were taken into custody.
Sandra Berchtold, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Detroit, said the three passengers were being interviewed and were not under arrest.
Nearly 3,000 people were killed 10 years ago Sunday when hijacked commercial airliners were crashed into the World Trade Center towers in New York, the Pentagon in Washington and a field in southwestern Pennsylvania.

Hells Angel charged with killing witness, two others

Posted on 09/12/2011 by admin 

GREENFIELD, Mass (Reuters) – A senior member of a Massachusetts local Hells Angels chapter was charged on Sunday with the murders of three men, including a key witness scheduled to testify against him, prosecutors said.
Adam Hall, 34, a reputed sergeant-at-arms at the Berkshire Hells Angels motorcycle club was charged with three counts of murder, kidnapping and intimidation of a witness, said Berkshire County District Attorney David Capeless.
David Chalue, 44, and Caius Veiovis, 31, also have been charged with murder, kidnapping, and intimidation of a witness in the triple murder, Capeless said.
Capeless announced the charges a day after a two-week search for three Pittsfield, Massachusetts, men who had disappeared under suspicious circumstances ended with the recovery of their bodies in the western part of the state.
Capeless did not disclose where authorities found the bodies of David Glasser, 44, Edward Frampton, 58, and Robert Chadwell, 47, or how prosecutors believe the men were killed. They disappeared on August 28.
Glasser was a key witness set to testify against Hall at a trial on assault, robbery and kidnapping charges scheduled to begin on September 19. Frampton was Glasser’s roommate and Chadwell a friend who spent time with the two men, authorities said.
In the upcoming trial, prosecutors had planned to present evidence that Hall hit Glasser with a baseball bat in 2009 over a dispute, and then tried to frame Glasser last year for an upstate New York robbery to cast doubt on him as a witness.
Capeless on Friday asked the court to postpone the trial because Glasser, a key state witness, was missing.
Authorities will be examining “the burial site” along with other locations and two of the alleged killers’ vehicles for evidence of the crimes, Capeless said.
All three defendants are scheduled to be arraigned in Central Berkshire District Court in Pittsfield on Monday.

Military jets escort two flights over security scares

Posted on 09/12/2011 by admin 

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – Military jets were scrambled to escort two passenger airline flights on Sunday because of security scares, as Americans marked the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.
Security concerns also led officials to close parts of the airport in Kansas City, Missouri, on Sunday for hours and question a passenger after screeners at a checkpoint raised suspicions about the contents of a bag.
Two F-16 fighter jets escorted an American Airlines flight to a safe landing in New York after a report of suspicious activity on the flight from Los Angeles.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said it was notified of passengers allegedly behaving suspiciously on American Airlines Flight 34 from Los Angeles International Airport to New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.
“Out of an abundance of caution, NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) scrambled two F-16 jets to shadow the flight until it landed safely at JFK,” the agency said in a statement.
The Boeing 767-200, on a flight from Los Angeles, landed at New York’s John F. Kennedy and the passengers disembarked without incident, the airline said.
A spokeswoman for American  said the crew did not perceive a threat.
“Our captain and flight attendants did not see that there was any security issue,” Andrea Huguely told Reuters, adding that the crew and airline did not ask for assistance.
Another American Airlines spokesman confirmed that the incident began with “suspicious behavior” observed in the area of the jetliner’s lavatory.
In another incident on Sunday, F-16 jets were called into action to shadow Frontier Airlines Flight 623 to Detroit Metro Airport after the TSA was notified of passengers allegedly behaving suspiciously, the agency said.
“Law enforcement met the flight, which was brought to a remote area of the airport,” The TSA said. “The plane was swept with negative findings and cleared.”
The flight, which originated in Denver, landed safely in Detroit. An airline spokesman said two passengers had been seen to be spending “an extraordinarily long time in the lavatory” and three passengers were taken into custody.
Sandra Berchtold, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Detroit, said the three passengers were being interviewed and were not under arrest.
Nearly 3,000 people were killed on September 11, 2001, when hijacked commercial airliners were crashed into the World Trade Center towers in New York, the Pentagon near Washington and a field in southwestern Pennsylvania.
U.S., state and local authorities said they approached the incident reports with an abundance of caution after a warning late last week that U.S. officials had received “credible but unconfirmed” information that three al Qaeda operatives had snuck into the country and were planning an attack to coincide with Sunday’s anniversary.
In Kansas City, the FBI and airport police bomb technicians were summoned because the passenger was uncooperative after screening agents flagged the baggage as suspicious, an FBI spokeswoman in Kansas City said.
The bag was dismantled, but no explosive materials were found and all parts of the Kansas City airport reopened later.

Travelers feel fear, resolve about flying on September 11

Posted on 09/12/2011 by admin 

BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) – Mariane and Richard Newton arrived for their flight at Boston’s Logan International Airport on Sunday with both the trepidation and resolve felt by many fellow travelers flying exactly 10 years after the deadly hijackings of four civilian airplanes.
Two of the jets took off from Logan on September 11, 2001 and crashed into the north and south towers of the World Trade Center in New York.
“It was very much in the back of our minds,” said Richard Newton, 59. But, “It’s like being struck by lightning. What are the chances?”
The mood in the Boston airport on the 10th anniversary of the attacks felt much like any other day. Some people arrived extra early anticipating a security backlog and were pleasantly surprised when the long morning lines moved swiftly.
Passengers slipped off their shoes, took off their belts, spread their legs and arms for patdowns and X-ray screenings. Ten years in, the stiffer safety measures felt routine.
Flag ribbons and white carnations pinned to the lapels of airline workers hinted at the day’s significance, and the suit-clad Transportation Security Administration agent taking photos of travelers weaving toward luggage screening belts signaled an increased alert for possible suspicious behavior.
Memories of the attacks were not far below the surface of order and calm.
Louvere Walker, a 33-year-old software trainer headed to California for a work trip, said she had some hesitation about flying on Sunday. She grew up in New York and recalled not being able to reach her parents or brothers there for some time after the planes hit.
“I remember that day almost like it was yesterday,” Walker said. “I just think to myself, I could have been traveling that day.”
Other passengers said they had no worries about heading into the sky. On a JetBlue Airways flight, some even watched historical footage of the smoking twin towers.
“I think it’s fine (to fly),” said Bill Rambo, a 53-year-old project engineer headed to North Carolina to golf. “We’re doing a better job with security.”
‘HIT REALLY CLOSE TO HOME’
At the Washington Dulles International Airport, where flags flew at half staff on Sunday, 24-year-old Sarah Mejia remembered her northern Virginia school being locked down 10 years ago when the attacks began. A plane from Dulles slammed into the Pentagon, killing 184 people.
A fourth plane took off from Newark International Airport and crashed in a Pennsylvania field. In all, nearly 3,000 people died as a result of the coordinated attacks.
Mejia now is close to marking her fourth year as a TSA security officer. She has worked every September 11, she said.
“It’s somewhat an honor to be here today, to watch, to say that people are not afraid to fly, and we are here to help,” Mejia said.
“Our family doctor was on the one that crashed here, at the Pentagon. It just hit really close to home.”
Emotions at Dulles also wavered between fear and firmness. A worker checking bags for Southwest Airlines said a teenage girl told him she was scared to fly to Denver.
But Elizabeth Hartman, a 32-year-old headed to Los Angeles for a Monday meeting, said she was not concerned about what officials called a “credible but unconfirmed” threat of an al Qaeda plan to attack the United States again on the 10th anniversary.
“We’re definitely more suspicious and wary, and that’s probably a good thing,” Hartman said. “But in some ways that wariness has been misdirected.”
Charles Walker, 69, and his wife, Marilyn, arrived in Washington from Los Angeles, where they said airport security was more than they had ever seen.
Reports of the credible threat put Charles Walker, a Vietnam veteran and retired deputy sheriff, at a bit of unease, but he said they were still eager to visit the nation’s capital to mark both the solemn anniversary and celebrate Marilyn’s birthday. She turned 67 on Sunday.
“We have to get on with our lives,” Marilyn Walker said. “We don’t just need to be reminded every year. We need to be reminded every day.”

Three passengers detained in Detroit after flight from Denver

Posted on 09/12/2011 by admin 

SHANKSVILLE, Pa (Reuters) – Thousands gathered Sunday at the site where hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 crashed as the nation paused to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people — including 40 passengers and crew here.

America mourns Sept 11 dead with somber ceremonies

Posted on 09/11/2011 by admin 

NEW YORK (Reuters) – Children yearned for lost parents and grown men and women sobbed in raw grief on the hard stone bearing the names of nearly 3,000 dead as America commemorated the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.
The name of every person killed in al Qaeda’s hijacked plane attacks was read on Sunday in the nearly five-hour-long centerpiece of a heart-wrenching ceremony where the World Trade Center twin towers stood.
“I haven’t stopped missing my Dad. He was awesome,” said Peter Negron, a child when his father, Pete, was killed in one of the towers. “I wish my Dad had been there to teach me how to drive, ask a girl out on a date and see me graduate from high school and a hundred other things I can’t even begin to name.”
There were smaller ceremonies in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon, the other sites were 19 men from the Islamic militant group al Qaeda crashed hijacked airliners on the sunny Tuesday morning of September 11, 2001.
The attacks led U.S. forces to invade Afghanistan to topple the Taliban rulers who had harbored al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and Washington began a “war on terror” that ousted Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and persists on several fronts to this day.
“Ten years have passed since a perfect blue sky morning turned into the blackest of nights,” New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at New York’s Ground Zero.
“Since then, we’ve lived in sunshine and in shadow, and although we can never unsee what happened here, we can also see that children who lost their parents have grown into young adults, grandchildren have been born and good works and public service have taken root to honor those we loved and lost.”
Thousands gathered at the site on a clear morning to grieve. With security tight and no traffic, there was an eerie silence where the 110-story skyscrapers collapsed a decade ago, sending a noxious cloud over lower Manhattan.
President Barack Obama, who visited all three attack sites, read from Psalm 46 in New York: “God is our refuge and strength.”
RUBBING NAMES
The ceremony — with the wail of bagpipes, youthful voices singing the national anthem and firefighters holding aloft a tattered American flag retrieved from Ground Zero — drew tears. Family members wore T-shirts with the faces of the dead, carried photos, flowers and flags in an outpouring of emotion.
For the first time, relatives saw the just-finished memorial and touched the stone where the names of their dead loved ones were etched. Some left flowers, others small teddy bears. Some used pencils to rub the names on paper, some took pictures, others leaned against the stone and cried.
The names of the dead were read by wives and husbands, fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers and children, some choked with emotion.
“May your soul finally rest in peace. Your son Nathan and I, as the years go by, grow strong. Goodbye, my dear friend, my teacher and my hero,” said Candy Glazer.
Glazer’s husband, Edmund Glazer, cheerfully called his wife from Flight 11 not long before he died when the plane hit the north tower — the first of that day’s horrific events.
Nicholas Gorki, 9, had these words for the father he never met, Sebastian Gorki, who died at the World Trade Center while his wife was still pregnant: “You gave me the gift of life and I wish you could be here to enjoy it with me.”
The September 11 attacks claimed the lives of people from more than 90 countries. They were followed by al Qaeda bombing assaults in London, Madrid and elsewhere and brought an international campaign to ferret out their members.
“God bless every soul that we lost,” said former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was called “America’s mayor” for his leadership after the attacks.
“SO MANY NAMES …”
The New York memorial includes two plazas in the shape of the footprints of the twin towers with cascading 30 foot waterfalls. Around the perimeters of pools in the center of each plaza are the names of the victims of the 2001 attacks and an earlier attack at the trade center in 1993.
Obama visited the North Memorial Pool in the footprint of the north tower. He walked around it hand-in-hand with first lady Michelle Obama, former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura. Obama touched the etched names of the dead before he greeted some family members.
“So many names, there is barely room on the walls of the heart,” said former New York Governor George Pataki, reading from the Billy Collins poem “The Names.”
Police in New York and Washington were on high alert against what authorities called a “credible but unconfirmed” threat of an al Qaeda plot to attack the United States again on the 10th anniversary.
The U.S. military said it scrambled two F-16s to accompany an aircraft flying from Los Angeles to JFK airport in New York after reports of suspicious activity, and the U.S. Secret Service said it was looking into threatening messages posted on the White House’s Facebook page.
At Shanksville, Obama laid a wreath where a plane crashed after passengers overwhelmed hijackers intent on piloting it into the White House or U.S. Capitol. Chants of “USA, USA” broke out from the crowd, gathered at the foot of a grassy hill. The Obamas talked with family members. “Thank you for keeping us safe,” one man called out to the president.
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett said the passengers on Flight 93 — remembered forever in Todd Beamer’s “Let’s roll” rallying cry — “set a new standard for American bravery.”
Later at the Pentagon, Obama placed a wreath of white flowers at the memorial, which says “September 11, 2001 9:37 AM” to mark the time the plane struck the U.S. military’s headquarters.
POPE URGES “REJECT VIOLENCE”
In the Adriatic city of Ancona, Italy, Pope Benedict prayed for September 11 victims and appealed to those with grievances to “always reject violence.”
In May, nearly a decade after September 11, U.S. forces killed al Qaeda founder bin Laden at his hide-out in Pakistan. The 2001 attacks prompted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the Pentagon still has a large number of troops and where violence persists.
“The 9/11 attacks were the beginning of a long winter in world history,” NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels. “But events in the Middle East have renewed our faith that although the desire for freedom can be repressed, it can never be extinguished. The Arab spring is a new season of hope for us all.”
There were moments of silence in the Ground Zero ceremony marking when the planes hit the twin towers as well as when they collapsed. Other moments of silence were marked when the plane hit the Pentagon and the fourth crashed in Shanksville.
After a faltering start at rebuilding, the new One World Trade Center is now more than 80 stories above the ground as it rises to its planned 1,776-foot (541-meter) height — symbolic of the year of America’s independence from Britain.
For many — particularly the more than 1,100 families who received no remains of their dead — Sunday was the closest they came to a funeral for their loved ones. With the memorial complete, it offered for the first time something resembling a final resting place and a formal place to mourn.
“When we came out here 10 years ago there was a hole in the earth and that’s how we felt,” said Dakota Hale, 25, of Denver, who lost his stepfather, flight attendant Alfred Marchand.
“Now, 10 years later there is grass and water and it feels kind of like a new beginning.”

Texas wildfire partly tamed; up to 22 people unaccounted for

Posted on 09/11/2011 by admin 

SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) – As many as 22 people who were ordered to evacuate by one of the worst brush fires in Texas history remained unaccounted for on Sunday, authorities said, even as firefighters appeared to be gaining the upper hand over the blaze.
The names of the 22 were posted in the Bastrop Community Center on Sunday alongside the now 49-page-long list of the 1,554 homes that have been destroyed in the so-called Bastrop Complex Fire — the worst, in terms of property loss, in state history. The fire has now consumed 34,000 acres.
Bastrop County Sheriff Terry Pickering cautioned that the list only reflected people whose whereabouts were unknown — and as the day progressed, officials said “some” of the missing had been found.
The others, Pickering said, “have not checked into a shelter. They could be on vacation. They could be with friends. If you know them, please have them contact us so we can be sure they are safe and sound.”
Stepped-up efforts to battle the massive brush fires burning across Texas, including the arrival of 2,000 firefighters and dozens of helicopters and aerial tankers, have helped push back the flames in many places, including Bastrop, authorities said on Sunday.
“Starting Monday morning, more people will be allowed to re-enter their homes or their property,” Pickering said to loud applause on Sunday at the community center, which has become a gathering place for the 5,000 people forced from their homes.
The fire is now more than 50 percent contained and Bill Paxton of the Texas Forest Service said he expects the containment numbers to grow over the coming two days.
“Today has been very productive,” he said. “We are making a lot of progress.”
The winds that whipped up the fires last week have died down, providing a boost to firefighters, Paxton said.
“The forward progression of the Bastrop Complex fire has stopped,” he said. “But now we’re doing house to house firefighting, and the dead grass between these homes continues to provide fuel for these fires.”
Paxton said the other major fire burning in Texas, the Riley Road Fire northwest of Houston, is also 50 percent contained. But he warned that fire, which has destroyed 59 homes, is still aggressively moving toward populated areas.
State emergency officials are now turning their efforts to helping the people affected by the fires, which have destroyed nearly 2,000 homes in Texas just in the past week.
Many people who live in the area affected by the Bastrop fire said they were becoming increasingly frustrated that they are not being allowed back into their homes.
“I know exactly where my street is. I can tell you that my house is gone. OK, move on. But I can’t do that,” said Monica Taylor, who found her address on the list of destroyed homes which is updated daily at the community center.
Governor Rick Perry’s office announced Sunday that $250,000 from the Texas Disaster Relief Fund is being distributed to people who have lost homes to provide one-week hotel vouchers.
The declaration of Bastrop County as a federal disaster area on Friday will make victims eligible for a wide range of other programs. Perry said the declaration should be extended statewide, pointing out that 140 separate fires have erupted across Texas just in the past seven days, consuming 154,000 acres.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has extended fire suppression grants, which help local fire departments pay for the costs of fighting the brush fires, to 55 Texas counties.
The root problem is a year-long drought. More than 80 percent of Texas is listed as experiencing “exceptional drought,” the most severe category, in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s U.S. Drought Monitor.
Paxton said the grass was already dead and trees were dying, describing the moisture content of Texas grass today at what he called an “unheard of” 2 percent.
“We have another day or so to get a handle on these fires, because on Tuesday we’re expecting the winds to pick up,” he said. “What we really need is rain. But right now, there is no relief in sight.”

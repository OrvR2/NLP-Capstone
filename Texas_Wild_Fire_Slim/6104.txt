More about this programme: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vhw1dThe McGurk effect is a compelling demonstration of how we all use visual speech information. The effect shows that we can't help but integrate visual speech into what we 'hear'.

@JDezi4 The point of this video is to show you that your mind can easily be tricked by an illusion. Both audio clips are the same, but the facial expressions of the actor makes your brain think otherwise.
It's like an optical illusion, but different.﻿

@MrNinjaness97 That's because you're thinking about it.﻿ If you were to watch this entire video for the first time with your eyes clsoed, you wouldn't.

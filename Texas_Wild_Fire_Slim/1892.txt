One Student’s Libyan Vacation, Who Donald Trump Is Fighting With Now, FEMA’s Waffle House IndexBy Adriana DiazPostsEmailBy Adriana Diaz | Trending Now – Fri, Sep 2, 2011

It's the wildest summer vacation story I've ever heard. Chris Jeon, a 21-year-old American UCLA student, said he "thought it would be cool" to spend his summer joining rebels in Libya in their fight against ruler Moammar Gadhafi. The Los Angeles native bought a one-way ticket to Cairo for $800, and then he hopped on a train to Alexandria, Egypt. After riding a bus to Benghazi, he hitchhiked with rebels to Tripoli. When the Christian Science Monitor's Kristen Chick came across Jeon in Libya she tweeted, "The American kid at front lines today came to see 'a real revolution,' said he was helping rebels but clearly didn't know how to fire a gun." She then tweeted, "He speaks no Arabic, no one knows he is there, he is staying with families/fighters. He is from LA, wearing a lakers jersey. Nuts." The photo of Jeon in a vintage Lakers jersey standing in the middle of a group of war-ravaged fighters says it all. Jeon told the National that when a rebel handed him an AK-47, he asked "How do you fire this thing?" Jeon told the Christian Science Monitor that he lied to his parents about where he was going and planned to return to California at the end of September for the first day of school. But his trip might end a bit early. Al-Jazeera English's Evan Hill tweeted, "Our team in east #Libya said rebels fed up with Chris Jeon, US kid who tried to join, told him 2 go, last seen on pick-up going 2 Benghazi." What do you think of Jeon's summer vacation trip? Tell us on Facebook.com/TrendingNow and Twitter @YahooTrending.
I know it's out of character, but Donald Trump is ranting! He took to his YouTube soapbox Wednesday to tell the world what he thinks of Dick Cheney's new book, and it's not pretty. In the video taken in the Donald's office he doesn't mince his words. He says, "I didn't like Cheney as vice president. I don't like him now. And I don't like people who rat out everybody like he's doing in the book." "The Apprentice" star has been using YouTube to voice his opinions on a number of issues. It seems none of his previous bashings have received the amount of social media attention this one has. One tweeter said, "Happy to see that Trump has found his calling as a YouTube ranter."
And finally, you won't believe one of the ways FEMA (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) measures the severity of disasters. It goes to the Waffle House! The 24-hour restaurant prides itself on being open all day every day no matter what. After a disaster, FEMA checks out the affected area's Waffle Houses. It even created a complex color-coded system. Green, or a full Waffle House menu, means minimal damage. Yellow, or a limited menu, means Waffle House is using a generator and the damage is serious. And red means Waffle House is closed and the damage is close to catastrophic. Waffle House kept it humble, tweeting "We're so proud of our disaster response team!"

all of you suckers on here talking down to this kid are ignorant idiots. each and every single one of you. this kid didnt ask you for fare money, isnt putting you in danger, and is doing NOTHING to affect your lives in anyway. obviously you have nothing better going on in your simple lives than to bad mouth some one who's balls are so big to they wouldnt even fit in your big mouths. this coming from me, a 2x combat vet who was so touched by sept 11 that i wanted to go fight in a war. granted my motivating factor was our country and its defense, but none the less when the rubber hit the road, it came down to me wanting to be in the front lines. if this kid ever joined the military id share a fox hole with him in a heart beat...and if he's killed out there then what? nothing. he did with his life what he wanted but he sure as hell lived more on one "vacation" than you suckers will live in a life time.

you guys got it wrong, leave chris alone. He is old enough to make well curved decisions so,don't make it your business to point an accusing finger-nail to a somebody who knows what he is doing. To me that's a great adventure, at least he will have some stories to narrate someday

That's the funniest thing I've seen in a while..hahaha... Oh man, talk about a crazy summer, i would love to see his buddies back in sunny California top that one. After all his CallOfDuty training he wanted to fire off a AK, and pitch in on a little Cou' de ta', who can blame him! As Ex-Military, my hats off to him for a ballsy move. Most people would crap as soon as the left cell range, let alone, be in the middle east getting ready for some s"!t to go down, and you cant even speak their language.

why bashing this young man, he will get the best experience that will change his life, meeting people from different culture, and seeing first hand armed struggle to remove a dictator, and crossing 2 different countires with different landscape. He is courageous, I did that before and it really did changed my life prospectives. Many of those bashers are probably did not leave their own county let alone their state, that will lead to narrow mindedness.

And now one close to him stopped him. This young man is so lost. He should have joined the marines or better yet he should have read a good book like" the peoples history of America."

Ignorance surfaces in a lot of ways.  It's "cool" to go and see a revolution or war where folks get killed and messed up?  Perhaps he should don a uniform and go see how cool Afganistan is.  Really cool for those fighting.......he could just sit and watch the atrocities and tell how "cool" it is.

Nov. 4, 2010 —COLLEGE STATION, Texas — Texas Forest Service officials are urging caution as deer hunting season kicks off this weekend. Hunters should refrain from building campfires and debris burning during windy or dry conditions. More than 60 Texas counties are currently under a burn ban.Although recent rains have brought some relief to drought-stricken East Texas, the potential for rapidly spreading wildfires remains on windy days. Freezing temperatures have occurred across parts of the state, resulting in dead grass. Fire departments and emergency responders are encouraged to stay prepared for the threat of wildfire.If you’re heading outside, keep in mind the following wildfire safety tips:• Obey outdoor burning bans. • Don’t build a fire during dry or windy conditions. • If there is no burn ban in place and conditions are right, you may safely build a campfire. But keep the fire small, never leave it unattended and remove flammable leaves and other materials from the area surrounding the fire. • Make sure the fire is extinguished and cold to the touch before you leave it.• Avoid burning feed bags. • Keep water handing when welding on stands.• Drive only on designated trails. Don’t park or idle vehicles in tall, dry grass, which can be ignited by contact with a hot muffler.• Use caution with cigarettes and matches. • Use spark arresters on all power equipment.

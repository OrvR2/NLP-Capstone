The Western Gulf Forest Tree Improvement Program is a cooperative tree breeding project founded in 1969 with the objective of providing the best genetic quality seed for use in forest regeneration programs in the Western Gulf Region of the United States. Current members include five states and 8 industrial members collectively responsible for planting 300,000,000 seedlings per year. The cooperative is preserving and improving populations of five southern pine species and several hardwood species.

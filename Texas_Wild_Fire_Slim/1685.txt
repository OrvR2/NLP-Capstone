New York prosecutors are widening their investigation into the manner in which Goldman Sachs (GS.N) marketed certain mortgage-linked securities before the financial crisis, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The Manhattan district attorney's office began its probe into Goldman following the release in April of a U.S. Senate subcommittee report into the causes of the financial crisis, the paper said.
The district attorney's office has issued subpoenas to Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and other investors in the deals. The prosecutor's requests to investors, including some hedge funds, concern how Goldman sold the deals, the Journal said.
Subpoenas do not indicate wrongdoing. They are formal requests for information and do not necessarily mean charges are forthcoming or likely.
A spokeswoman for Manhattan district attorney's office declined to comment on the Journal report to Reuters. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment to the Journal. The bank could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours.

				This couldn't possibly be the same Goldman Sachs that Obama got so much of his cabinet and czars from could it?  You know those economic genius that have been helping fix our economy. I had a Chicago Lawyer tell me that before he was done Obama was going to be involved in so many corrupt scandals it wouldn't be funny. Sounds like he might be correct.

				Why ANYONE would continue to do business with this firm is incredulou­s. These mortage backed securities are the tip of the iceberg for all these investment brokers. How EASY was it for them to recommend that their clients buy a security and then short the same bad securities­. The heads of all these firms should be put in jail. It's about damn time.

Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tesifies before the Senate in April 2010Mark Wilson/Get­ty ImagesThey weren't murderers or anything; they had merely stolen more money than most people can rationally conceive of, from their own customers, in a few blinks of an eye. But then they went one step further. They came to Washington­, took an oath before Congress, and lied about it.

Thanks to an extraordin­ary investigat­ive effort by a Senate subcommitt­ee that unilateral­ly decided to take up the burden the criminal justice system has repeatedly refused to shoulder, we now know exactly what Goldman Sachs executives like Lloyd Blankfein and Daniel Sparks lied about. We know exactly how they and other top Goldman executives­, including David Viniar and Thomas Montag, defrauded their clients. America has been waiting for a case to bring against Wall Street. Here it is, and the evidence has been gift-wrapp­ed and left at the doorstep of federal prosecutor­s, evidence that doesn't leave much doubt: Goldman Sachs should stand trial.

				In my opinion, any investigat­ion into Goldman Saks, AIG, Smith Barney, Countrywid­e Loans, and Bank of America is good news. They are crooks. the CEO's ripped off the American taxpayers by accepting billions of dollars in stimulus bailouts, and immediatel­y used that money for CEO bonuses. The rape of the American taxpayer continues to this day, with Goldman Saks because if memory serves me, Timothy Geithner, a former employee and CEO of Goldman Saks, was caught not paying income tax and blamed it on a Turbo-tax software program.

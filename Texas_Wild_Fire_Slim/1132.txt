PHOENIX -- El Paso, Texas, police arrested a Southwest Airlines passenger on a flight from Phoenix after he refused to turn off his cell phone.
Southwest Airlines spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger in Dallas told The Associated Press Tuesday the man turned his cell phone on as the flight was landing in El Paso on Monday.
Eichinger says when the man was asked to turn his phone off, he did not and when the plane pulled up to the gate, El Paso authorities met the aircraft.
The man's name and other details were not released.

So what is the best whey protein??
Fist of all in our discussion what is the  best whey protein, let’s define what is whey protein and how to define  “THE BEST” whey protein.
Whey protein is protein found in cow’s milk. It is considered to be more efficient than soy protein or other protein. As all types of protein it consists of amino acids which are “building bricks” that are used in muscle building. And what is bodybuilder’s first goal? Right, to gain muscle mass and do it in most efficient and healthiest way. The biggest plus of whey protein is that whey protein is easy to digest and is probably best sourse of BCAAs (branched-chain amino acids). 
 That’s about whey protein. It is basics in understanding of role of protein in healthy and proper way of bodybuilding. 
Next let’s look at  forms of whey protein. It can be isolate, hydrolysate and concentrate. 

Isolates have lower      level of lactose and fat but minus is that it also have lower level      of bioactivated compounds. Isolates      are 90% and more protein by weight.
Hydrolysates are whey which      were hydrolyzed. That means the protein is broken down into      smaller pieces which start to be utilized as soon as it is consumed.
Concentrates have a low level      of fat but as in fact they have higher levels of bioactivated      compounds. Concentrates are      29–89% protein by weight.

What form of whey protein is  BEST? This is really good question, because there are big debates as to which kind of protein is digested the best, otherwise the consensus is that whey proteine isolate (WPI) is the best whey protein available. But it doesn’t mean that hydrolysate and concentrate are useless. And there is another good question: what can be better that whey protein isolate? The answer is -  the blend of whey protein isolate, whey protein concentrate and whey protein hydrolysate. 

And now let’s get closer to a market.


There is really tons of good whey protein and protein mixes available. But as we start this is not question of good that is question of best whey protein.

EDITORIAL: SpaceX, its Central Texas facility, are our next hope for U.S. astronauts

Tuesday September 6, 2011

Last week’s surprise announcement by Russia that it is indefinitely postponing any further manned launched missions of their spacecraft to the International Space Station because of technical troubles might seem to threaten the future of space missions. But here in Central Texas, we know that if anyone can take U.S. astronauts into space one day, it’s SpaceX.This latest wrinkle just adds further emphasis and attention to the dynamic and creative ways SpaceX is re-creating and rethinking the future of our space missions. And this spunky company is doing so right here in our backyard at its McGregor facility, where every Merlin engine and Draco thruster — which power its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft — is tested.SpaceX so far is the undoubted leader in the newly privatized space industry. It is the best hope our country has for carrying our astronauts to ISS.The company already has successfully launched both spacecraft, which are capable of one day carrying humans. On Dec. 8, 2010, SpaceX launched its Dragon spacecraft, which became the first commercial space flight to orbit Earth and safely return. This followed the company’s June 2010 historic first launch of its Falcon 9 rocket, which SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk called “a major milestone not only for SpaceX but the increasingly bright future of spaceflight.”Although neither vessel has been cleared to transport humans, SpaceX is working in earnest toward that. It even has a manned launch date goal of 2014.The company’s upcoming 12 unmanned cargo missions to the ISS via its Dragon spacecraft also will offer proof of SpaceX’s ability to brave the rigors of space. Of course, if Russia recalls all of the astronauts from ISS, then there would be no need to take supplies and goods to ISS, SpaceX  communications director Kirstin Grantham told us.But she didn’t view this challenge with glumness. Not at all.  “The U.S. is in a position where the only way to get astronauts to the ISS is through Russia, and SpaceX is the leader right now to change that,” she said. “The U.S. has to have alternatives to Russia. We can’t be completely reliant on an aging system from a foreign country.”No doubt that’s a huge responsibility and one that would ensure the ongoing success and operation of the $100 billion International Space Station. We have no doubt that SpaceX is up to this challenge.From its remote facility west of McGregor, its engineers are developing devices that will take us beyond Earth. It is picking up where our grounded NASA space shuttles left off, and it is blazing new frontiers using products first tested right here in Central Texas. Things are still looking up.

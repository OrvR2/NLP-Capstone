September 11, 2008--COLLEGE STATION, Texas--During times of emergency, such as an active hurricane season, emergence response personnel need access to the most current resource information possible. This is where the Texas Regional Response Network (TRRN) can help. The TRRN, implemented in November 2004, is an application that was designed to help users gather resource information to help in emergency response and planning. The system was developed for the Governor’s Division of Emergency Management (GDEM), which oversees a Comprehensive Emergency Management program. It was originally developed to help better facilitate mutual aid assistance by allowing users to track state emergency resources. Through the TRRN, users can add information about fires, law enforcement, search and rescue, public works, transportation and other emergency response resources. The system also allows users to search for various resources by category, type, county, Council of Governments (COG), Designated Disaster Center (DDC), or location. All retrieved information is displayed in an interactive map. There are over 4,000 users currently registered with the TRRN. Users include cities, counties, fire departments, police departments, sheriff departments, volunteer fire departments, all 24 COGs, state agencies, emergency medical services, ambulance services and many others. Currently, all jurisdictions that received equipment from a $5,000 or more Homeland Security Grant must register with the TRRN to be eligible for future grants. The information on the TRRN needs to be updated by users regularly so that the database is us up-to-date as possible. During hurricane season, this is especially important since resources are in high demand. For more information, or to register with the TRRN, visit the website at https://www.trrn.state.tx.us/.

expensive storm in the history of the US is "an excuse for more debt"?

 Wow, I bet you wonder why your House of Representatives has the lowest approval ratings in history, don't you?
First of all your link doesn't prove anything and second of all did you ever think the Congressional approval rating was a result of them NOT standing up to Obama and the Reid lead Senate by not demanding 4 trillion in cuts and a balanced budget?? think.
Edit-Um, Mike S what part of "volunteer" do you not understand?
i am not downgrading the damage from the hurricane I have seen many a hurricane, but the fires in Texas are hardly minor and has caused the loss of many homes and businesses near Austin and all over Texas. a great nation such as the US should always come to the aid of their citizens in a time of a natural disaster.
 Several lives have already been lost in Texas
Republicans learned everything they need to know in Kindergarten:
 "1 for me, 1 for you… 2 for me, 1 for you… 3 for me, 1 for you… 4 for me, 1 for you…"
Even better, I've got friends in Texas who were saying that Perry cut the budgets of volunteer fire departments by 75% hoping they wouldn't need them.
Maybe Perry campaign slogan instead of drill baby drill is going to be burn baby burn.
what a surprise….Y! answers forms your entire world and political view….
 I hope you take Vitamin D supplements…
That's right. the Elitist Eastern Blue bloods can suck it.

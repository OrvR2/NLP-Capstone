Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post intelligence reporter Dana Priest and producer Michael Kirk of Frontline's "Top Secret America" are taking questions for a live web chat at 1 to 2pm today on the rise of America's  national security state.
You can watch the film here, and read Priest and William Arkin's Top Secret America series in the Washington Post.
You can submit questions ahead of time. I'll be posing some questions as well.

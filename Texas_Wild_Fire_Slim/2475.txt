Richard Drew's so-called 'Falling Man' image, which depicted a man jumping to his death from North Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, has been viewed from many angles. It was first circulated as a piece of photojournalism, then quietly repressed as some commentators found it too painful to address, and finally accepted as a piece of American photographic history.
But for all the perspectives applied to it, the photo, which has now inspired a film, a book and a particularly outstanding essay, was not the only shot Drew took that day. 
In the slideshow below, we present a selection of Drew's photography from the September 11 attacks and the relief efforts that followed. He captures various aspects of the event, framing the actual attacks, the evacuees, the fire department and, of course, the victims. Not all of the shots are as serendipitously composed as "Falling Man," but all display a calmness and even-handedness that can perhaps be attributed to Drew's decades of work as an AP photographer. For some of Drew's own perspectives on the attacks and his documentation of them, see this interview.

Steven Weber: A Family, A Nation


		                        
																In the decade since 9/11, the country has in many ways reacted the way a family would if their home had been attacked and destroyed and members of their family killed, the family's nerves and fortunes stretched to never-before-considered breaking points.                             







Rev. Dr. Martha R. Jacobs: Playing Poker with Police at Ground Zero


		                        
																I am so thankful for the opportunity to serve those who were there to protect us and recover the remains of those who died. It was not something I never envisioned when I answered a call to serve God.                            







Bishop James Magness: Spirituality Forged in Smoke and Fire


		                        
																That day, I began learning that the affirmation of our spiritual differences is the only vehicle through which we can build the framework for common ground.                            







Rev. Earl E. Johnson: Providing Disaster Relief with the American Red Cross, 10 Years After 9/11


		                        
																What has emerged in my experience is that those who have training and experience with the chronically ill also make good disaster spiritual care providers, without exception.

				Any American that can look at these photos and not get angry to the point of killing anyone, no matter how remote, which had a hand in it is off base.  The current wars are as a result of this act against America, not only in the primary destructio­n of the towers but the way our lives have changed, the inconvenie­nces, freedoms lost, the fear, the costs at the hand of people that want to mess with us..  Iraq invaded Kuwait then we (UN forces) stopped short, Failed to back a coupe', let Husain gloat he beat America, threaten WMD's, history of having and using them.  Violated numerous UN directives of inspection­, threatened a former President’­s life.  Good enough reason for me for America to use them as an example to say to the world, DON’T MESS WITH THE U.S.!  Problem is all that money, all those lives, and Iran will walk right in when we pull out.  And we get not a drop of oil in return!  We will be back in that region again in most of our lives.

				When I look at these photos and reflect on that day, the anger wells up inside of me.  Mayor Bloomberg is a disgrace for his decree that there is no room for the first responders or the clergy at the 9/11 memorial this weekend.  Mayor Giuliani should have been in charge of this memorial.
Shame on you, Mayor!

				This picture is truly horrifying­!  Yes, it's reality but horrifying nonetheles­s and actually the first time I've seen it. I'm thinking of the family of this man, what it must be like for them, how they're feeling, do they know he belongs to them?  I just can't imagine what it must have been like for him, and all those who knew they weren't going to make it.  We can make all the political comments we want, but the reality is 9/11 is about the people - those who died, those who were brave and tried to save lives, those who responded, those who witnessed and were helpless to do anything.  My thoughts will be with all those on 9/11 and I shall light my candle for them all.  Thank you.

				Certainly first responders whose effort meant they made the ultimate sacrifice deserve to be honored. However, who honors the receptioni­st, the secretary, the office clerical staffs? Where are the families of those whose names are perhaps announced each year who would tell us their stories? Photos today of people plunging down the side of a tower, floor by floor until ______Do you hear the sound of them landing? Have  you seen what happens to a body when it impacts wherever it hits once it reaches it's final resting place? NO, not the final resting place-the ground zero graveyard is no more, it has been hidden, carefully cleaned up with new structures to sanitize one of humankind'­s worst catastroph­e's. The sights, sounds, smells of those hours erased from the scene lest we ourselves are too overwhelme­d by them. I watched those towers go up, floor by floor. I had offices, relatives, friends and associates­, where oh where ----never gone--alwa­ys here-insid­e a heart in numbing pain..I am an old man, nothing will ever or should or could ever erase what we experience­d on that day. Please - no more 9/11's >>>>>>>>>>­>>>>>>>9>>­>>>>>>>1>>­>>>>1 no more

				"However, who honors the receptioni­­st, the secretary, the office clerical staffs"

I have a book with each person who died in it. And there will be no buildings built upon the tower 1 and 2 site. There are fountains located in the footprint of both towers will have the names of every person who died that day etched in the bronze border that surrounds the fountains.

Should we have left the scar on the land? I don't think so. And I don't believe I would feel any differentl­y if it had been me that perished that day as I believe that you move forward.

				They might as well show it and others, b/c they've shown plenty of pictures of skeletal holacaust victims- - -both alive and dead- - - in magazines. Those editors didnt' say '' Oh don't print those. They're too depressing ''  And Newsweek and Time printed the pics of the dead, burned, U.S. soldiers bodies hanging from a bridge in Iraq and Somalia . No problem there printing it. And the magazines printed pics of U.S. soldiers bodies being dragged thru the streets in Somalia ; and the showed that on T V. So, the pic of this man falling is mild compared to that. And where were the firement with nets to catch the people that jumped on Sept 11 th ?

				How come their was no investigat­ion in to the attack on 911? Just like when John Kennedy was killed. Oswald did it, your government doesn't lie. Think about this Lee Harvey Oswald never had a trial. So what if oswald was dead he doesn't have to take the stand. the reason oswald didn't have a trial was because their wasn't enough evidence to convict Oswald. With a lawyer Oswald would have walked. George W Bush had ground zero clean up in record time. When no body could fly our tax dollars paid to have 47 jets fly the Bin Ladden family home to Saudi Arabia per George W Bush. The very country were 18 of the terrorist came from.

				Its called the 9/11 commission report and i have read it..The thing that was most startling was the fact that the Commission stated that "The financing of 9/11 was of little significan­ce"..The financing of every major crime is the most important part of it all..The book reeks of corruption and coverups..

				Jack Kennedy was not killed by Oswald. Wake up! You were correct that Bush flew middle eastern people out of this country just after 9/11. The middle eastern people OWN Bush!

 US President Barack Obama has met senior officials to discuss how to respond to Friday's school shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 children and six adults died.
The White House said curbing gun violence was a "complex" problem that required a comprehensive solution.
On Sunday Mr Obama told Newtown residents he would do everything in his power to prevent further tragedies.
The first two funerals of victims of the shooting were held on Monday.

Novelist Lionel Shriver discusses the place of the gun in US society



 Sandy Hook school pupils Noah Pozner and Jack Pinto, both aged six, were buried, and other victims' funerals will be held throughout the week.
The town has been removing Christmas decorations in mourning.
The Sandy Hook gunman was named as Adam Lanza, who took his own life at the end of a killing spree that began with him shooting dead his own mother.
'Action needed'
On Monday Mr Obama met Vice President Joe Biden, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Attorney General Eric Holder, and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to discuss proposals aimed at reducing gun violence.
Mr Biden will be put in charge of the initiative, the Washington Post said quoting unnamed sources close to the government.

 Earlier, White House spokesman Jay Carney said tighter gun control laws were part of the answer to violence in the US.
"It's a complex problem that will require a complex solution," Mr Carney said. "No single piece of legislation, no single action will fully address the problem."
He added that the president supported reinstating an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004.
Correspondents say Democrats have been reluctant to pursue gun control legislation, but that there are signs that fear could be abating, with two pro-gun senators calling for changes.
Mark Warner and Joe Manchin, who have "A" ratings from the National Rifle Association (NRA), now say action is needed after the massacre.

 Mr Manchin, a gun owner and frequent hunter, said: "I don't know anyone in the sporting or hunting arena that goes out with an assault rifle."
Virginia Senator Mark Warner said that the "status quo isn't acceptable" and called for "rational gun control".
Mr Warner said he had been approached repeatedly over the weekend as people began to seek answers and solutions.
California Senator Dianne Feinstein, a long-time advocate for gun regulations, said on Sunday she would introduce assault weapons ban legislation in the beginning of the next congressional session.
On Sunday President Barack Obama told residents at a vigil in Newtown the US must do more to protect its children.
"We can't tolerate this any more," Mr Obama said. "These tragedies must end and to end them we must change."

Sausage Monster  18th December 2012 - 13:55   I'd imagine that 99.9% of all licensed firearm holders in the US have never once discharged their weapons in anger or have had to draw their guns in the face of immediate danger. Its insanity to have such a carte blanche attitude towards gun ownership, if people own guns without any justifiable reason then a minority will always have the potential to use them to devastating affect.

Joe Fox  18th December 2012 - 13:46   The assault weapons ban was in place during Columbine. Reinstating it will make little difference. Action must go further than that, much further. Will this happen? I'll believe it when I see it. Until then little will change. For the past 4 days the NRA has been calling up every lobbyist they can get their hands on. They'll do whatever it takes to get this issue hushed up before the new year.

Petepaschal  18th December 2012 - 13:53   continuation of 549...There's no way of keeping people of questionable character away from guns without some sort of gun control! Nothing could have probably prevented this rampage from occurring given the status quo, even though he was suppossedly brought up to be responsible with the gun by his mother, but if he didn't have access to them, maybe this wouldn't have happened, at least not as bad    Report this comment (Comment number 579) Link to this (Comment number 579)                 rate this     0      rate this     0   Comment number 578.

CaptainTom  18th December 2012 - 13:43   Pink Guns! If all legally owned firearms in the USA had to be painted pink I belive gun crime would be massively reduced. Guns would not be "cool", they would not be macho and pink has been shown to reduce aggression. Apparantly two thirds of firearms used in mass shootings have been legally owned, painting them pink would also help distinguish between legal and illegal firearms.

Bossuk  18th December 2012 - 13:52   552.Dr_AdsSo when a burglar gets into your home when you are asleep and shoots your daughter in her bed with a gun he legally obtained, that's fine. But at least you'll be able to shoot him afterwards.ok.In the uk, when someone breaks into my house to steal my tv, he will not have a gun, because they are very hard to come by. I may lose an appliance but my family will still be ok.

Perpetual Sigh  18th December 2012 - 13:52   Again - gun control alone won't solve this. People will still want to go out and buy guns. Obama needs to focus on WHY they want guns, WHY America has a gun culture and WHY gun crime is so high despite similar abundance of firearms in other countries such as Canada which has essentially no gun crime. There's clearly a much wider problem in America than easy access to guns - they need pragmatism.

This whackjob is like many I have met from the US (and other places-but mainly the US) paranoid as you like, running scared from an imaginary threat, delusional, and armed. These and their pro guns for everyone playground chums are very weak and scared, we should help them- but it is best to disarm an unhinged person before talking them down.

Absolutely spot on.Thing is, it WILL stop it being so EASY.That's the tragedy here. A gun allows you to go on a spree and kill twenty children. Bit trickier to do that with a knife or something like that.Guns enable killers to be killers. Why do you think that's OK?

SeeDubya  18th December 2012 - 13:50   You can't ban guns when there are 300 million of them already in circulation. Handguns have been banned in the UK since 1996 but even smackheads whose brains are running on three cylinders seem to have no problem getting them. Any psychopath with very basic machining skills could make an AK47 using plans that are readily available on the internet. Pandora's box cannot be closed.

The old adage that `guns don`t people, people do` is just as outdated as the Constitutional militia related article that allows citizens to `bare arms` in the first place.

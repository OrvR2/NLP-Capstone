I feel sorry for the woman, she was busted for an error. However playing the race card was nothing more than stupid on her part. But how many white people who get stopped by the police do you hear ranting and raving about one injustice or another. It was a human nature reaction, we're all humans aren't we?

Is the Illuminati﻿ a modern day smoke screen (as was the U.F.O.s of the last century) perpetrated by the powers that be so that they may conduct their dealings whilst the likes of David Icke and Alex Jones rant and spit half truths about the actions of those in power? Doesn't the promotion of ideas such as Alien species ruling our world in some way undermine the argument and vindicate the actions of those humans in power who are making inhumane decisions which affect humanity as a whole.

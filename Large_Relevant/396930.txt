WASHINGTON (AP) — Wounded former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords will appear as an unscheduled witness Wednesday at the year's first congressional hearing on curbing gun violence, adding drama to a session that was already slated to hear from a top official of the National Rifle Association.
Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who suffered a severe head wound in a 2011 Tucson shooting spree that killed six people, was not expected to take questions, according to a Senate aide who revealed the details only on condition of anonymity because they had not been announced.
The dramatic juxtaposition between the NRA and a famous shooting victim set the stage for the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose own members are divided. The conflicting approaches among the lawmakers are a microcosm of the divisive debate at large that gun limits will face on their way through Congress.
Wednesday's hearing is a response to the Dec. 14 shooting rampage that killed 20 first-graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and transformed gun control into a top-tier issue in the capital.
"The time has come to change course," Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., one of Congress' leading gun-control advocates, said Tuesday. "And the time has come to make people safe."
Feinstein, a Judiciary Committee member, has already introduced her own legislation banning assault weapons and magazines of more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he would listen to proposals and agreed that reviewing the issue was timely.
"But I'm a strong supporter of the Second Amendment," he said Tuesday, citing the constitutional provision that guarantees the right to bear arms, "and I don't intend to change."
The chairman of the panel, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said in his prepared opening statement Wednesday that it is "a simple matter of common sense" that there should be a strengthening of background checks and that doing so would not threaten gun owners' rights. The checks are currently required for gun purchases from licensed dealers but not at gun shows or other private transaction.
"Let us forego sloganeering, demagoguery and partisan recriminations," he said. "This is too important for that."
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., indicated that whatever the committee produced wouldn't necessarily be the final product, saying the package would be debated by the full Senate and senators would be allowed to propose "whatever amendments they want that deal with this issue."
Despite the horrific Newtown slayings, it remains unclear whether those advocating limits on gun availability will be able to overcome resistance by the NRA and lawmakers from states where gun ownership abounds. Question marks include not just many Republicans but also Democratic senators facing re-election in red-leaning states in 2014. They include Max Baucus of Montana, Mark Begich of Alaska and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.
Knowing that television cameras would beam images of the hearing nationally, both sides were drumming up supporters to attend Wednesday's session.
A page on an NRA-related website urged backers to arrive two hours early to get seats, bring no signs and dress appropriately. The liberal BoldProgressives.org urged its members to attend, saying the NRA "will try to pack the room with their supporters to deceive Congress into believing they are mainstream."
Earlier this month, President Barack Obama proposed a package that includes banning assault weapons, requiring background checks on all firearms purchases and limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds.
Giffords underwent a lengthy rehabilitation process and has regained some ability to speak, but has retired from Congress. A gun owner, she and her husband Mark Kelly, a retired astronaut, have formed a political action committee called Americans for Responsible Solutions to back lawmakers who support tighter gun restrictions.
In testimony prepared for the hearing but released Tuesday, Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice president, said such steps had failed in the past. He instead voiced support for better enforcement of existing laws, beefing up school security and strengthening the government's ability to keep guns from mentally unstable people.
The massacre in Newtown has also set off a national discussion about mental health care, with everyone from law enforcement leaders to the gun industry urging policymakers to focus on the issue as a way to help prevent similar mass shootings. The issue of mental health has arisen in four recent mass shootings, including Sandy Hook, the Tucson shooting, the incident in an Aurora, Colo., movie theater last year and Virginia Tech in 2007.
"Law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals," LaPierre said in his statement. "Nor do we believe the government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families."
While not yielding on specifics, much of LaPierre's statement had a milder tone than other remarks the NRA has made since Newtown.
That includes an NRA television ad calling Obama an "elitist hypocrite" for voicing doubts about having armed school guards while his own children are protected that way at their school. While Obama's children have Secret Service protection, officials at their school have said its own guards don't carry guns.
Feinstein said Tuesday that she will hold her own hearing on gun control because she was unhappy that three of the five witnesses testifying Wednesday are "skewed against us."
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday he would wait to see what legislation Democrats produce. Republican leaders of the GOP-run House have expressed similar sentiments.

Ras poll:71% See Gun Rights As Protection Against Tyranny as two-thirds of Americans recognize that their constitutional right to own a gun is intended to ensure their freedom as 47 states revolt against Obama gun control.

Chief in charge Milwaukee Sheriff: Says it is Your Duty to Protect Your Family with Guns

Clinton’s Gun Whopper “Half of all mass killings in the US have occurred since the assault weapons ban expired in 2005" Facts:1980s: 32, 1990s: 42, 2000s: 28. Clinton lies again.

Obama's Drones Have Killed over 3300 civilians and at Least 176 Children in Pakistan alone, even including 2 American children without a declaration of War. Where is the outrage from the libs?

Over 7000 people die by drowning every year in the USA, that's about 20 every day. Should we ban all swimming pools?

Obama Signs Bill Giving Him & his family Armed Protection for Life. All the rich politicians in DC & Hollywood rich send their kids to private schools, protected by armed guards as well as being protected by armed guards themselves.

Gun Owners In New York Planning To Defy New Registration Requirement: “Come and Take it!” and in Poll: 65% Of Firearm Owners Would Defy Any New Laws Confiscating Guns

Obama/Holder want guns to protect them & their kids, but not yours?

Feinstein's bill exempts all gov't offiicals/political office holders and their body guards from owning the guns she wants to ban from every US citizen. Also Homeland Security just ordered 7,000 assault rifles that are banned form us citizens.

Soccer moms and teenage drivers kill far more kids than nuts with guns. Maybe we should ban soccer and lock up kids during their teens, not to mention drunk drivers.

Those who hammer their guns into plows will plow for those who do not."
~Thomas Jefferson When you remove the people's right to bear arms, you create slaves.

"Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the act of depriving a whole nation of arms, as the blackest."~ Mahatma Gandhi

Be very afraid US Citizens of the people who want to take your rights away, be very afraid.

Don't let Obama and lib dems take your guns. Just some facts from Paul Harvey.

* 1929 the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929
to 1953, approximately 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were
rounded up and exterminated.

*In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915-1917, 1.5 million
Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

*Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to
1945, 13 million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, the mentally ill, and others, who
were unable to defend them, were rounded up and exterminated.

*China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952,
20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up
and exterminated.

*Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to
1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and
exterminated.

*Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979,
300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and
exterminated.

*Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to
1977, one million “educated” people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded
up and exterminated.

*That places total victims who lost their lives because of
gun control at approximately 56 million in the last century. Since we should
learn from the mistakes of history, the next time someone talks in favor of gun
control, find out which group of citizens they wish to have exterminated.

Paul Harvey, 2nd amendment protects our freedoms, if it goes there goes our freedom and our republic for good.

A government big enough to give everything you want is also big enough to take everything you have

Why is she unscheduled? Why do people assume victims opinions have weight? Their opinions are always skewed making them biased.

We need to stop blaming the tools and start blaming the fools.

Drunk drivers accounted for 10,228 traffic deaths last year. That's 31% of traffic deaths due to drunk drivers.

Traffic deaths due to drunk drivers have increased 52% since 1982.

Now, last year, there were there were 12,664 murders in the US. Of those, 8,583 were caused by firearms. So drunk drivers kill almost as many people as murderers and more people than guns do. 

32,310 traffic deaths, 12,664 murders.
10,228 killed by drunks, 8,583 killed by guns.

According to MADD, one person is injured every minute of every day by a drunk driver in this country.* That amounts to 60 people every hour, 1,440 people a day, 10,080 people a week and 524,160 people a year. And those statistics do not include the people who died from their accident injuries. 

All of the numbers are higher for cars and drunks than for guns and murderers, and yet we're not banning cars..

Also, Gun Crimes have gone down everywhere that Concealed Carry Laws have permitted Law Abiding American Citizens to carry concealed carrry firearms.

You see, drunk drivers, like other criminals, don't care about the law. They don't abide by the law.

So, you have to have "Uninsured Motorist" coverage because of all the drunks driving without a license, registration or insurance.

They DON'T CARE what the law is. They BREAK the law and drive drunk anyway. They KILL people daily with those cars.

And yet, we don't have background checks for cars. We don't talk about banning cars. You see, it's not the CAR, it's the DRUNK DRIVING CRIMINAL who is the problem.

It's the same with guns. CRIMINALS DON'T CARE about the Law. It's not the gun, just like it's not the car. It's THE CRIMINAL that's the problem, not the gun.

WAKE UP!!!!!-I'm reposting this from earlier to EXPOSE this FACT, and HOPEFULLY get some more debate on the SOURCE of the PROBLEM:In 1957 there were over 500,000+
institutionalized in State Mental Institutions and we had reasonable involuntary commitment laws. We had no modern "gun control" laws, could buy your M1 Carbine through the mail along with all the 30 round magazines you wanted- yet mass random shootings NEVER HAPPENED!!! Was 1957 America a police state? Doctors and judges made the decision who to keep in the loony bin, and they could not get out until they were no longer a threat to self or a public threat. You still had the rights to a lawyer and judge to prove your sanity and get out if there was no basis for the decision.

Today we have emptied and closed the State Mental Institutions, created the homeless population, made involuntary commitment impossible until AFTER you commit a crime- and then try and blame guns for the actions of the mental patients!!! Jared Laughner- parents tried to get him help at least twice but were turned down for la#$%$ insurance, neighbors said he would ride around on his bike talking to himself, school said he was unbalanced- in the PAST he would have been institutionalized long before he shot Gabby based on his obvious illness! Virginia Tech- school teachers said he was unbalanced- in the PAST he would have been institutionalized based on his obvious behavior!!! Colorado- His college psychiatrist was so alarmed by Holmes that she had him banned from the campus, but nothing else. Colorado media, including the Denver Post, reported last month that Fenton rejected a law enforcement offer to involuntarily confine Holmes for 72 hours after he told her six weeks before the shooting that he fantasized about killing "a lot of people." In the PAST- she could have had him involuntarily committed BEFORE he hurt anyone, you didn't have to wait until they were an imminent threat to themselves or others!!! What was even the POINT of him trying to get help from the psychiatrist when all she did was ban him from the school???!!! Even Charles Whitman in 1966, the first of these crazed m#$%$hooters warned authorities before hand by seeking help from Texas University's school psychiatrist- repeatedly! He had severe migraine headaches and extreme anger that HE knew was irrational, turned out he had a BRAIN TUMOR- discovered AFTER his death!!! He even told his psychiatrist he was fantasizing about shooting people from the tower!!! If his school psychiatrist had remotely done his job he would have gotten the help he sought. To this day Texas University won't release all of Whitman's medical records, claiming the deceased "right to privacy"- so the school won't be SUED!!!! Newtown CT- Mother was so scared of her son she told sitters not to turn their ba#$%$ on him even if they went to the bathroom, but with him not having committed a crime involuntary commitment is virtually impossible and there is no where to send him. 40 years ago he would have been institutionalized in a State Mental Institution based on his behavior. You know where the largest State Mental Institution in Connecticut is? NEWTOWN- its been CLOSED for DECADES! This is NOT a "gun control" issue!

Reply, don't just give me a mindless "thumbs down" if you disagree

A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government." George Washington, 1790

A Cato Institute white paper states that "tens of thousands of crimes" are prevented each year in the United States by legally armed citizens exercising their Second Amendment right to self-defense.
The 58-page study, "Tough Targets: When Criminals Face Armed Resistance from Citizens," was released in early February 2012. In it, authors Clayton Cramer and David Burnett analyzed news articles recounting the defensive use of firearms over an eight-year span.
According to the study's findings, in the vast majority of self-defense cases, the gun is never fired--its presence in the hands of a would-be victim or witness resulted in thwarting a crime or detaining criminals until they were taken into custody by law enforcement. 
Tim Lynch, director of Cato's Project on Criminal Justice, writes that among the study's significant conclusions is the statistical confirmation that, "The defensive use of guns happens much more often than most people realize," and, "Each year gun owners prevent a great deal of criminal mayhem – murders, rapes, batteries, and robberies."

Ms. Giffords,  If you'd been hit by a drunk driver in a car instead of shot by a shooter with a gun, would you be advocating banning cars?

.
It hurts when kids are shot. I get that, and I agree.

But kids drown in swimming pools at 4 times the rate they get shot ( murdered or accidentally) and are murdered by drunk drivers at a rate 10 times higher than they're murdered by shooters and at a hundreds of times higher rate in auto accidents, yet nobody is clamoring for swimming pools to be banned, nor auto's to be banned, nor do we treat drunken drivers with the seriousness of their crime.

Why not?

What makes it easier or better for kids to die in swimming pools or be murdered by drunk drivers than for them to be murdered or accidently killed by guns?

I've pulled kids out of swimming pools whose parents didn't know they were in there for hours. I can still taste the lake water from doing mouth to mouth for an 11 year old boy for an hour and half as we tried to recusitate him. That was almost 40 years ago.

I've pulled kids out of wrecked cars whose parents were the drunk drivers. I've pulled them out of wrecked and burned cars who were hit by drunk drivers. Their mangled little bodies are no less mangled than the little kids and techers that were shot.

Murdered, mangled and burned beyond recognition as a child is no worse and no better than being shot multiple times as a child. Both are horrible ways for a child to die and those who perpetrate it should be held fully accountable.

Again though, why are we holding the guns responsible when we don't hold pools or auto's responsible?

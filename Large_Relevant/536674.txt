To all of the trolls out there: If you don't feel for the families that lost their members, and for a country which is going through a hard time with this tragedy, please just don't comment. This is not the right time to be insensitive﻿ or to criticize. Just save it for another moment.

Oh so now it's appropriate to talk shit about a country going through hard times?﻿ I don't remember seeing any brazilian talking shit when the wtc went down, or when those children died in Newtown. You can have any response you want, but I just don't think it's fair to those who are suffering, and those who actually care.

Keep thinking like that and you'll go far. If it's﻿ our problem and not yours, then keep your rude attitude to yourself.

What do you have against me laughing at the fact that these dummies didn't have what﻿ it takes to get out of a building alive? It's their problem not mine. Survival of the fittest--and they lost!

You're just an intolerant jerk who﻿ can't handle a difference of opinion.

I can handle your opinion, I just don't like it. Is that a crime now? To see 233 people die all at once in a tragedy and not even flinch is not the problem here. Your comments about it are the problem. You can have any opinion you want, but﻿ your attitude makes YOU the intolerant jerk.

So everyone whose opinions you disagree with aren't entitled to posting them?﻿ Seems you aren't tolerant of freedom of speech. More people die everyday to the flu than the number of dummies who died in the nightclub fire.

Sorry. I presumed that you would understand a little something called 'respect'. You'd think it would be bigger than the right (or will) of saying whatever comes to your head, but of﻿ course not.

You should know yours and be more respectful with people who help you when you're broken. We're﻿ the world's number one market also for shops in USA (more than US$ 3 billions spent last year only in NY). You should care about your rare friends, being nice at least when a tragedy happens.

Kids what did we learn from this? Pyrotechniques show NEVER EVER be used in closed enviorments. Its common sense.....if anyone ever invites you to a similar event, kindly decline. Trust me﻿ your life is not worth it....no matter what famous artist is performing

Brazil is as unsafe as America is: the difference is just a matter of places. . Over there, fire﻿ took place in a disco, up here, fire takes place when people are shooting at the schools....

You are pretty my darling, i am sure there is SERIAL KILLER on your trail, hope your car don't break on the road, or you walk﻿ alone in a street at night, i am sure you are safer where you are LOL. In BRAZIL we don't even leave our doors locked at night. This tragedy happened but it is rare and will never happen again.

Look the last fire tragedy in Brazil took place almost a century ago it was in a CIRCUS FIRE, so nobody can say Brazil is unsafe( i am well informed). I know this place was unsafe because was not following brazilian fire code regulations like having fire extinguisher in working conditions every 1500 square feet, the owner of club was negligent so sh.t happens. Look at the bright side those﻿ shirtless kids saved hundreds of lives.

What a stupid comment! This is a first time in a century that this tragedy occurs, look at your and europeans countries how many tragedies since then not talking about millions of deads in wars. And if you research VIETNAM, even today people are dying of effects of AGENT ORANGE and also there are 3 million vietnameses with﻿ birth deffects. And look at NEW YORK years ago someone pour gasoline outside night club and torched it causing dozens of deaths. tch tch you pretty but....

Yep just﻿ noticed that. Whenever I go to places that are so enclosed and filled, first thing I do is find the exits and closest one to my position. Most were drunk. And yeah that's the risk some club owners are willing to take(not having the proper sprinkler system etc). Peoples safety is the last thing on their mind. Money rules all

I'm a serious musician. I'm a vocalist, multi-instrumentatlist, composer, who﻿ is self-taught but I had 20 yrs of training. I trained at Curtis, rating higher than Julliard in the US. It's the premiere music school in the US I taught myself many things but I know it takes years of extreme hard work, training and creativity to be excellent at music. The commercial world is so out of it. They don't think it takes extensive training. It takes self-education and extensive training.

It makes me very sad that we live in such a misogynistic society that a young﻿ woman can't have a few relationships without being criticised for it. Any woman who calls another a "slut" or "whore" should really be ashamed of themselves.

Well you see, Taylor Swift does the same thing to other girls in her songs.....And the reason she is getting such backlash is not so much because people think she's a slut or a whore, but rather that she is praised as a wonderful role model﻿ and sweetheart when she makes revenge songs against people who 'do her wrong' when it really might be partially her own fault ( considering how she seems to perceive relationships where everything is perfect and made of cupcakes and fairytales).

That's not entirely true. Look the case of John Mayes. We also hate him because he is a " slut". But personally don't consider Taylor as a slut , because she didn't choose﻿ to be dumped all the time.

Now I'm all for sexual freedom for women and may they get laid like never before!
But, complaining and﻿ writing songs about Every. Single. Relationship. And trying to keep the image where you're still "daddys little girl forever" is kind of hypocritical.
...Even if the songs are catchy as all hell. ;)

I'm a serious musician. I'm a vocalist, multi-instrumentatlist, composer, who is self-taught but I had 20 yrs of training. I trained at Curtis, rating higher than Julliard in the US. It's the premiere music school in the US I taught myself many things but I know it takes years of extreme hard work, training and creativity to be excellent at music. The commercial world is so out of it.﻿ They don't think it takes extensive training. It takes self-education and extensive training.

Hey all!
Please take a few seconds to read this!
I’ve been working really hard trying to get my channel more known but it’s really hard to do this when you can’t afford proper advertisement, and I’m really sorry to spam…
I’m a 19 year old aspiring musician, and at the moment I’m uploading cover songs mainly (but I do have original material up too!). It﻿ would mean the world to me if you could take a look.
Please give me a chance to make my dream come true!
Love to all x

Everyone who Commented bad ate haters,If you don't like her why did you see the Video?Im not a Taylor swift fan,but I dont have hate in my heart,if she thinks her hair looks good than so be it,It isnt anyones to judge,Being rude is unnecessary,The video makes sense,Basically what happened was﻿ this,She had a Bf who was a troublemaker,who got her into a alot of bad things,He left her for a different girl he met at the club and she is saying why did she go out with him she knows he was trouble

No "anti-racists" say a 100% Black area needs more diversity.
No "anti-racists"﻿ say a 100% Asian area needs more diversity.
No "anti-racists" say a 100% Muslim area needs more diversity.
They say ALL & ONLY White area need to be more diverse, and that White areas only stop needing to be more diverse when there are no White people left in them.
Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.

Actually it's not stupid. I post these messages to target fellow Whites because White people are the ones who need to seem them the most. I posted it here because anti-Whites ban our discussions everywhere else so we take them where we﻿ can. Glad you saw.

If just 1 person reads it would mean so much to me. Hey people my name is Janira. I am 16 and I love to sing. Maybe I am just a dreamer, but I am not the only one. I know these things are annoying, but I would really appreciate it if anybody would check out my channel. Plz all﻿ I am asking for is a chance.
At least a THUMBS UP would help.

I do enjoy this sweet, catchy pop song. Yes, pop song. I hope she isn't labeling this song country as compared to her early singles. Taylor Swift is talented with a lot of potential. However, I am﻿ having a difficult time labeling her recent work country music. >_<

Inside of destroyed nightclub revealed 
CNN's Shasta Darlington details new video showing the inside of a Brazilian nightclub that was destroyed by a deadly fire.
Investigators found all of the fire extinguishers in the club were either expired or fake.
Police also discovered that the licenses for the business are no longer valid. The old license limited the capacity to 670 people. The night the blaze killed 234 people, there were about 2,000 packed into the club.
Watch: Woman rescued from nightclub by stranger

Labor rights groups seek action after Bangladesh factory blazeBy Serajul Quadir | Reuters – Sun, Jan 27, 2013

DHAKA (Reuters) - International labor rights groups called on Sunday for global clothing retailers to ensure adequate safety measures for garment workers in Bangladesh after a blaze killed seven employees at a small factory.
              Saturday's fire gutted Smart Exports Garment Ltd, just two months after Bangladesh's worst ever factory blaze killed 112 workers and injured 150 at Tazreen Fashions Ltd, a multi-storey garment workshop in Dhaka's Ashulia suburb.
              In a joint statement issued after the latest blaze, three organizations asked retailers and brands to sign a fire safety agreement with Bangladesh.
              "After more than two decades of the apparel industry knowing about the risks to these workers, nothing substantial has changed," the Executive Director of the International Labor Rights Forum, Judy Gearhart, said in the statement.
              "Brands still keep their audit results secret. They still walk away when it suits them and trade unions are still marginalized, weakening workers' ability to speak up when they are at risk," she added.
              The Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) and the Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) also signed the statement.
              Another rights group, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights (ILGHR), said on its website it had gained access to the gutted factory and found seven women workers had been crushed to death as employees tried to escape the fire.
              Firefighters and police said the cause of the latest blaze was not yet known. Survivors said it could have been caused by an electrical short circuit at the factory on the upper floor of a two-storey building in the crowded Mohammadpur area.
              Kalpona Akter, Executive Director of the Bangladesh Center for Workers Solidarity told Reuters that two garment factories had subcontracted orders to the factory's owner, Smart Export Garments Ltd.
              She said the company was not a member of the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association and had no license from fire prevention or labor bodies.
              An official report into the Tazreen blaze in November concluded it was the result of both sabotage and negligence.
              Bangladesh has about 4,500 garment factories and is the world's biggest exporter of clothing after China. Clothing makes up 80 percent of its $24 billion annual exports.

THIS is what labor unions are for - not keeping sub-par workers in their jobs.

As long as the jeans stay $10 at Walmart, no one in America will care about these poor workers. I buy union made clothes online that are made right here in America. I sleep a little better at night knowing they do not have the stench of third world child labor on them. Well worth the $40 a pair. Stop supporting the retailers that exploit these people for fun and profit.

While all these groups represent good causes, it is unforturnate but the cards are stacked against organized labor at this time.  Businesses are calling all the shots.  The bottom line is KING OF THE ROOST.

I wish American companies would just add another 5 or 10 dollars on a shirt or other clothing and make it here where at least the workers have some measure of safety and actually get their pay. This Grand Bargain for cheap labor and Chinese junk only benifits the crooks that run these places and you can bet there is a Fat Cat American thats behind it all. Shame on Wal-Mart, Sears, Pennys, Target, K-mart, Shopko, and all the rest of them.

Here we go again.  Everyone will play the blame game and nothing will get done.  Lots of crocodile tears will be shed by the companies, politicians, unions, owners, etc.  The poor will suffer.  Most clothing companies will deny they have anything to do with this company but in fact, no one knows who is dealing with whom. It is an intricate mess.  Even worse, the same building will reopen in 3 months and people will go to work there because they need the job.  It is sad that the value of life in the 3rd world countries is considered worthless.

You will be surprised if you know how many millionaires are in Bangladesh. At least half million people are millionaires here among most of them evade taxes . The country's  per capita income is only about 600 usd only while half million millionaires live in this country.This is the disparity of wealth and example of a bad governance in my motherland!

Most Bangladeshis are Muslims, they only follow the Code of Koran not the Safety Code. They depend on God not on Fire Safety Equipment. Incase of fire, they recite scriptures from Koran, they dont care about Fire Extinguishers.

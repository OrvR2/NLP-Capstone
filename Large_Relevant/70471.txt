Japanese airlines ground 787s after latest emergencyBy Mayumi Negishi and Tim Kelly | Reuters – Wed, 16 Jan, 2013 6:35 PM EST

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's two leading airlines grounded their fleets of Boeing  787s on Wednesday after one of the Dreamliner passenger jets made an emergency landing, the latest in a series of incidents to heighten safety concerns over a plane many see as the future of commercial aviation.
              Boeing's shares fell 3.3 percent as analysts began to lose some of their conviction in the stock, which had held up relatively well despite the dozen or so issues with the plane over the last six weeks.
              All Nippon Airways Co  said instruments aboard a domestic flight indicated a battery error, triggering emergency warnings. Shigeru Takano, a senior safety official at the Civil Aviation Bureau, said a second warning light indicated smoke.
              Wednesday's incident, described by a transport ministry official as "highly serious" - language used in international safety circles as indicating there could have been an accident - is the latest mishap to hit the world's first mainly carbon-composite airliner in recent days.
              "I think you're nearing the tipping point where they need to regard this as a serious crisis," said Richard Aboulafia, a senior analyst with the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. "This is going to change people's perception of the aircraft if they don't act quickly."
              ANA, which said the battery in the forward cargo hold was the same lithium-ion type as one involved in a fire on another Dreamliner at a U.S. airport last week, grounded all 17 of its 787s, and Japan Airlines Co  suspended its 787 flights scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.
              The two airlines, which operate about half of the 50 Dreamliners delivered to date, said they would decide on Thursday whether to resume Dreamliner flights the following day.
              COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW
              The 787, which has a list price of $207 million, represents a leap in the way planes are designed and built, but the project has been plagued by cost overruns and years of delays. Some have suggested Boeing's rush to get planes built after those delays resulted in the recent problems, a charge the company denies.
              Both the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said they were monitoring the latest incident as part of a comprehensive review of the Dreamliner announced late last week. Financial analysts warned of the impact on a wider universe of companies.
              "This is another major negative for the B787 and its supplier(s) ... as this heightens the risk of a forced slowdown of the production ramp-up," Kepler analyst Christophe Menard said, adding the latest incident was "extremely disturbing."
              It was not just analysts, however, passengers were also nervous about boarding the plane after the latest upset.
              At Warsaw's Chopin Airport, the LOT national carrier was announcing over the public address system that one of its Dreamliner aircraft was making its maiden trans-Atlantic flight on Wednesday. Some of the passengers checking in for the flight to Chicago expressed misgivings.
              "We have decided to fly on the Dreamliner, but we are a bit worried since we've heard information that this plane is full of defects, albeit they are not really major," said Daniel Rekret, 34, who was traveling with his wife and children.
              ALARM TRIGGERED
              A spokesman for Osaka Airport Authority said ANA flight 692 landed at Takamatsu at 8:45 a.m. local time. All 129 passengers and eight crew evacuated via the plane's inflatable chutes. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said five people were slightly injured.
              At a news conference - where ANA's Vice President Osamu Shinobe bowed deeply in apology - the carrier said a battery in the forward cargo hold triggered emergency warnings to the pilots, who decided on the emergency action. "There was a battery alert in the cockpit and there was an odd smell detected in the cockpit and cabin, and (the pilot) decided to make an emergency landing," Shinobe said.
              In a statement later, ANA said the main battery in the forward electrical equipment bay was discolored and there were signs of leakage.
              Passengers leaving the flight told local TV there was an odor like burning plastic on the plane as soon as it took off. Marc Birtel, a Boeing spokesman, said: "We've seen the reports, we're aware of the events and are working with our customer."
              Robert Stallard, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said lost revenue at the Japanese airlines could prompt compensation from Boeing. "What started as a series of relatively minor, isolated incidents now threatens to overhang Boeing until it can return confidence, and this looks to be a near-term challenge given the media's draw to all things 787," he said.
              UNDER REVIEW
              In Asia, only the Japanese and Air India have the Dreamliner in service, but other airlines are among those globally to have ordered around 850 of the new aircraft.
              Australia's Qantas Airways  said its order for 15 Dreamliners was on track, with its Jetstar subsidiary due to take delivery of the first planes later this year.
              India's regulator said it would wait for a safety report from Boeing, expected later Wednesday, before deciding whether to ground the six Dreamliners operated by state-owned Air India.
              United Airlines, the only U.S. carrier now flying the 787, said it was not taking any immediate action in response to the latest incident.
              The Dreamliner's problems echo those of rival Airbus , which a year ago survived a crisis of confidence after a series of incidents with wing cracks on its A380, the world's largest passenger jet. Those problems tested the manufacturer's relations with airlines, but no plane orders were canceled.
              COST BURDENS
              Shares in GS Yuasa Corp , a Japanese company that makes batteries for the Dreamliner, fell 4.5 percent. The Kyoto-based company said it was too early to comment on the situation.
              The use of new battery technology is among the cost-saving features of the 787, which Boeing says burns 20 percent less fuel than rival jets using older technology.
              Lithium-ion batteries can catch fire if they are overcharged, and once alight, they are difficult to put out as the chemicals produce oxygen, Boeing's chief engineer for the 787, Mike Sinnett, told reporters last week. He said lithium-ion was not the only battery choice, but "it was the right choice".
              The 787 is Boeing's first new jet in more than a decade, and the company's financial fortunes are largely tied to its success. The plane offers airlines unprecedented fuel economy, but the huge investment to develop it coupled with years of delay in delivery has caused headaches for customers, hurt Boeing financially, and created a delivery bottleneck.
              Boeing has said it will at least break even on the cost of building the 1,100 new 787s it expects to deliver over the next decade. Some analysts, however, say Boeing may never make money from the plane, given its enormous development cost.
              Any additional cost from fixing problems discovered by the string of recent incidents would affect those forecasts, and could hit Boeing's bottom line more quickly if it has to stop delivering planes, analysts said.

Has anyone noticed?  Even terrorists aren't flying that much these days.  Those airplanes are getting to be too dangerous even for them.

The lithium batteries sound like a bad choice for an airliner - catches fire easily and hard to put that fire out.

Some sleepness nights for Boeing execs, I'd imagine.  As a layman (and the media doesn't really help here) I have no way to measure the problems relative to what the 777 had when it came out.  And hey, the new Airbus crashed right at the airshow, and we still all fly on those...

The Under-Qualified Union workers you are referring to are most likely the battery manufacturer that is based in China.  It's the QC of the suppliers that is the issue here.

Ultimately the problems from rushing this airplane into production can be blamed on greedy and possibly under-qualified union workers that delayed progress for their own misguided benefit.

This has nothing to do with the Chinese or else. In fact every planes may not look the same but can have defects. Unfortunatly, everything built by humans is and will always be imperfect except everything that GOD touches or has created.Everyone should know by now that their life does not belong to them anymore when boarding on a plane. Indeed, reaching your destination is a luck. The good news is that we only travel with our body and leave our soul on the ground.  I am quite sure you have always had the feeling of missing your town and the people you left behind. What you should know is that the real thing you are missing here is your soul you left behind and once u return home ( I am talking about your point of origin), you feel so much relieved because your body has reunited with its other part.... Your soul.   Have a blessing day. Xoxo.

This is what happened when the Chinese conspired with Russia to supply the faulty Lit Batteries numbering over 4000 to Boeing ....this is orchestrated to sabotage the US aim supplier of passenger airlines.

I read﻿ the first two books before the first two seasons of GOT. Should I read the third book first, too? I'm assumeing season three will be based on the action in book three.

hey, i know there are little chances of HBO seeing this or even taking it﻿ into account, but could they make in a season 1 special extra episode that should be about Robert's Rebbelion (if you ask me they could an entire show about it), it should be a detouring episode, that does not have to have anything in connection with the current series.
just for the fans.

no thats not true. I think they shouldnt do an﻿ extra episode or a movie and here is why. There are many unanswered questions in the books connected to Robert´s Rebellion (The tower of Joy, Lyanna´s final moments) and making a movie or just showing it on tv would spoil the readers.

Something that worries me: "The season we have been looking forward to so...passionately..." Love this show...but worried about a major drop off after the third season concludes. Granted, the book slows down a lot too, but I just hope the producers don't lose interest ﻿

Well the fourth season is also from SoS and will contain its fair share of awesome twists (certain deaths that shift the balance somewhat). I dont blame them for looking forward so much to the RW in this﻿ season though.

But I do admit I'm glad of the choice of mance I personally in the books sort of pictured him as﻿ so. Bravo can't wait...I am finding myself watching a lot of UK tv now and love all the friends I'm finding in those roles we are so sheltered hear in the USA by Hollywood......

Dominic West of the WIRE was the producers first choice for Mance but he turned down the role. He would've been awesome but Ciaran Hinds is a﻿ great backup plan.

I wish everyone would shut up about Ciaran Hinds not being﻿ a good choice for Mance. He's a brilliant actor and the casting in the series has been excellent so far. George R.R. Martin himself said that Hinds was a great choice, saying he was a big fan of Rome and loved his performance as Caesar.

Yes, Ciaran Hinds is a really great actor! BUT NOT AS MANCE!!! I love Mance, i really do, but he'd have made a great Crow's Eye or Victarion, but not MANCE! I always said that﻿ he's too old and doesn't look good with long hair!

I always thought Mance looked and acted like Bill from Kill Bill, especially﻿ with his lute (since Bill played guitar). Also, I hope they make Daenerys more awesome and less detestable. Her "Unsullied moment" in Astapor is one of the most badass of the entire series at that point and I'd hate for it to not be an epic win moment as intended, but instead a "fuck, now the brat's even more powerful" kinda deal. On that note, Jojen had better be one monotonous sonofabitch or I'm gonna be pissed.

The nice thing about the book Game Of Thrones is beacuse some minor characters become bigger and more important in the next book, or even in the next chapter, so when they choose some actor to play some part they should always choose the best, because he could work more in the next﻿ season.

If you don't like the show, don't watch it.
Im a book fan, but I still enjoy the show. You have budget to consider in TV & film adaptions, not in books. The Arya/Tywin scene in season 2﻿ were not in the book but were fantastic, Tyrion's confession in season 1 was much better in the TV show then the books. I don't like some of the changes but I'm still capable of enjoying the show & the fact that this show is making more people read the books is also a good thing.

For anyone that has﻿ not already heard, there is a Total War Mod for Game of Thrones called Westeros: Total War. It's still in the Alpha stage's but is very enjoyable, give's you a chance to re-write the story, i.e burning The Twins to the ground as Robb Stark.
All the links along with tons of playthrough footage can be found on my channel.
Help spread the word, the mod is sadly unknown to some Ice&Fire fans and is looking to be epic when fully finished, weekly updates are found via the links.

I thought it would be interesting if they did a prequel series. I know it wouldn't be from something that George wrote, but maybe the events before the first season. See characters like Rhaegar and﻿ Lyanna and others.

You mean the 4th and the 5th? Hard to combine the 3rd and 4th books to the same seasons and leva the 5th out cos' it happens at the same time as the 4th.
The 3rd book will be 2 seasons, 4th and 5th will most probably be 1 or 2, but they'll go in the order that the things happen, so the beginning of ADwD will﻿ be in the beginning of the season too.

Oh yeah, I meant the fourth and fifth, sorry. Doing it that way will probably come over a lot of the issues people have with those books. Hopefully that lasts two seasons as well, so George might even have The Winds of Winter out by then,﻿ lol.

So.. what your saying is appending anything from real life to fantasy is futile.. yet that is a pretty much what A Song﻿ of Ice and Fire is and not just A Song of Ice and Fire but any and all Fantasy period. Please, next time, think about what you say before you make yourself look like a total dumb ass :)

Seeing as Martin said that the inspirations he gathered to create Dorne, things such as﻿ his Sand Steed is inspired after the Arabian Horse and also the 2 vital trade routs to Dorne were inspired by the trading routes of mid-evil Europe through and into the West Indies, I would think its safe to say Dorne was created with Middle Eastern influences.. shall I provide any more history lessons of the Seven Kingdoms for you, sir?

While that is true, there's a piece of﻿ art on GRRM's official page, under Ice and Fire sample. it's an Arianne chapter, with at illsutration. On the picture she's not that far off, and I guess it wouldn't be there if it was nothing like the image in the author's head.

Martin sold the rights to character illustrations to Fantasy Flight, meaning he gives the illustrator a rough idea of what the character looks like and the illustrator drawls up what he/she thinks is the best depiction of said character. So with that in mind Martin has little to no choice but to accept what the illustrator comes up with also, Martin has been quoted as saying if the show got around to showing Dorne they would most﻿ likely cast Middle Eastern and or Spanish actors.

Also, geographically speaking, India is considered Middle﻿ East. However, for political affiliation, India is seen as being in the Southeastern Asian demographic. There is your "lesson" good sir.

I will say this though, maybe you'll agree maybe you wont however, if she'll ever get away from Merlin then maybe she can fill the role of one Laura Croft. Katie McGrath is﻿ Laura Croft.

Yeah, he had a full nose at the end of season 2 so it shouldn't be a surprise. But yeah, such a disappointment. Still, hope they stick more to the books this season. But I highly doubt that. They go further and further of books by﻿ every new season.

Obviously he has just a scar, it would be too difficult to make him noseless. And that doesn't make sense even in the book, to be honest. It's hardly possible to cut a nose off and leave a scar on the cheekbones while not cutting eyes or brain﻿

I can't WAIT to see Daario! I just read his first scene an hour ago and am psyched to see how they pull off his crazy costume. Also, huge fan of Ciaron Hinds and I think he's amazing for Mance Rayder.
However, I'm a little scared that we're not going to see the sexy Prince Oberyn until season 4, because they haven't announced his casting. Please let his just be too hot to show so early!
I'm definitely going to be done the book before the first episode airs, and I'm so excited to see it﻿ alive!

they're probably not bothering with the red﻿ viper until season 4 because all that really happens with him before page 700 or so in ASoS is an introduction scene, then there's a few hundred pages of other happenings, in of which he's only mentioned, nothing really happens with him.

yes at the end﻿ would make the most sense, or near the end. If properly executed, it will be some of the best television in history for fans of the show and books. It would make sense for them to end season 3 with that, or perhaps arya's scene directly after.

@Alison Williams That's about how I picture his scar. Exageration and hyperperboly seems to fit both Tyrion's way of talking and how people wild describe a dwarf. If he was literally missing half his nose﻿ I think they'd say "his whole nose and half his face cut off."

Actually, since none of those things actually happen in the books, they aren't actual spoilers, which is﻿ the point. They're joke spoilers. To which RhodesLivesOn replied with a joke, pretend outrage at the original commentor's supposed spoiling of a huge plot point that never happened.

Am I the only one disappointed in Tyrion's scar? He's supposed to be missing half of his nose! I know prosthetics is uncomfortable and time consuming to put on, but they did good enough on the Hound why not Tyrion?
It's just that the scar does have quite a reasonable impact in the story, it doesn't really make sense when it's a little scratch like that, especially when you've already got Peter Dinklage playing the part. If he's going to be﻿ handsome, at least disfigure him the right amount :/

You're right. That's an excellent choice. But I think James has some other show he's working on called 'The Following' so I wonder﻿ if he'd be able to commit to GoT. I'd be so awesome if he could though and if the producers cast him.

They have to unless they're﻿ going to cut Penny which would not be a good idea because she is important but there is nothing that tells me they have found the actress to play her.. :c
Hopefully they will use unidentifiable actors with helmets and then just have Penny tell Tyrion later that she was one of the dwarves at the Purple Wedding instead of him recognizing her.

Finish the 3rd book before the season, trust me, you might think that finishing the book will spoil the season but trust me when I say seeing this season will spoil the book much more. There is an epic turn in the book﻿ that is written so well that you wont want it spoiled by the end of this season.

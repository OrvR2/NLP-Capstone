You're probably right, but the defeatist attitude doesn't win votes and the "something's gotta be done!" crowd won't stop until some kind of knee-jerk, reactionary law or policy is implemented. I figure if I'm going to point out the flaws in one set of proposals, I should at least have a proposal of my own to put forward.﻿ If nothing else, it's always better to have more choices to pick from.

All these things would help, but im not sure human nature can be changed that much. I guess it remains to be seen.﻿

I know many things have been put in pace to prevent, or diagnose lead poisoning. The lesson to be gained is that we must address root causes to have an﻿ effect on crime. Guns are not a root cause. What bothers me about the gun debates is that it tends to direct efforts away from thins like the economy, health care, and education. A better funded police force, better care for people on psychiatric drugs, and more honest job opportunities would reduce crime as a whole including gun deaths.

The lead problem has been largely fixed, it's not used in fuel anymore. The almost always occurring correlation was found from old data. They don't have a causal link because they don't know the mechanism, but its a very strong correlation.
It is unlikely that the number of guns will or can go down even if everyone agreed. The bottom line for me is that i﻿ don't know how in that context one could lower gun related deaths. Most likely you will have to learn to live with it.

In that case, the solution would be fixing the lead problem rather than debating the merits of gun ownership. Fire, explosives, and machetes are used in the US, though I'm sure you meant that as hyperbole. Criminals use whatever is available. Guns don't make people criminals. Maybe lead does. Maybe psychiatric drugs do. ﻿ Maybe it's unemployment rates. But bottom line, give an honest man a gun, and he's still an honest man. Take an honest man's gun away, and he's a defenseless honest man.

Well, fire and explosives and machetes are not used as weapons in US, guns are. Fire killed in 2010 2640 people, at the same time firearms 31672 people.
It is possible that when firearms are harder to get, the usage of other tools to commit crime goes up, but based on the experience of other countries, it's not that dramatic.
Crime overall is a more complex issue. There were a series of studies that showed a connection between lead and violence. Up to 20% of crime may have﻿ been caused by lead.

I suppose "meaningless" is overstating it. However, most guns are owned by people who wouldn't become criminals if machine guns were free. The criminals wouldn't stop being criminals if guns went away. Therefor, I don't feel it's the﻿ most effective place to be focusing our limited resources. The most horrific mass murderers of the last century with the highest body counts used fire or explosives. Effective tools don't get more available than that. Total violence does not correlate to guns.

Taking away all kind of weapons wont end violence and crime, people will just find stick and a nail and make it a weapon. Guns are singled out because they are an effective tool and not hard﻿ to use. More availability to effective tools means more tragic incidents. Thats why i think that the correlation is not meaningless.

True, but to analyze "gun crimes" and say that it correlates to guns is meaningless. Better to look at violent crime as a whole to judge the effectiveness of policy. Gun crimes may go down, but do other forms of violent crime and murder just go up? Honestly, if we could magic away all the guns, I worry what﻿ mass murderers would use instead. Bombs and chemical agents have been used before. Search Hebei Tractor Rampage. Banning guns will not end mass murder.

I agree, people are the same everywhere, Americans are not more violent then anyone else, the only thing that strongly correlates to gun violence is numbers of guns per capita. US has a 88 guns per 100 people, the majority of the rest of the world has 10-20 guns per﻿ 100 people. Violence in general is more complex then that but i suspect that less opportunity to use these weapons means less gun related accidents.

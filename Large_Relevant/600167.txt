NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday signed into law one of the nation's toughest gun-control measures and the first to be enacted since the mass shooting last month at an elementary school in neighboring Connecticut.
              The following are some key provisions of the legislation:
              Mental health alert: Mental health professionals will be required to report to local officials when they have reason to believe a patient is likely to cause serious harm to themselves or others. This information will be cross-checked against a new gun registration database. If such a patient possesses a gun, the license will be suspended and law enforcement officials will be authorized to remove the firearm.
 Assault weapons ban: The law provides a stricter definition of assault weapons, and implements an immediate ban of defined assault weapons. Under the stricter definitions, semi-automatic pistols and rifles with detachable magazines and one military-style feature will be considered assault weapons. Semi-automatic shotguns with one military-style feature will also be considered assault weapons.
              Assault weapons possessed before the effective date must be registered within a year and recertified every five years. Owners of grandfathered assault weapons may only sell out of state or through an in-state federal firearms licensee. Under the legislation, the AR-15-style Bushmaster used in the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting will be illegal.
              Ammunition restrictions: New York will have the nation's strictest ban on high-capacity magazines - seven rounds, down from 10. It includes a ban on possession of pre-1994 high-capacity magazines, requiring owners to sell banned magazines out of state within one year. Existing 10-round clips are grandfathered, but may only be loaded with seven rounds.
              Ammunition purchase tracking: The legislation makes New York the first state in the nation to track ammunition purchases in real time. All dealers must be registered with the state police, and each sale will require both a state background check and transmission of a record of the sale to the state police, so as to enable alerts of high-volume purchases.
              Direct internet sales of ammunition are banned. Ammunition ordered over the Internet must be delivered in a face-to-face transaction with a firearms dealer. The purchaser will be subject to a state background check. Authorities have said the accused gunman in the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting amassed 6,000 rounds through direct online purchases.
              Recertification of handguns and assault weapons: Individuals who have a handgun license or have registered an assault weapon must recertify every five years. The state will establish an electronic gun permit database.
              Universal background checks: All gun transfers between private parties, except immediate family, must be conducted through a federal firearms licensee, subject to a federal National Instant Criminal Background Check. This closes the so-called private-sale loophole.
              Webster provision: Murder of a first responder engaged in his or her duty is punishable by a mandatory penalty of life in prison without parole. This provision was created following the deaths of Lt. Mike Chiapperini and Tomasz Kaczowka, volunteer firefighters who were ambushed responding to a deliberately set fire in Webster, New York, on December 24.
              Extending and strengthening Kendra's Law: Kendra's law will be extended for two years - through 2017 - and the period of mandatory outpatient treatment will be extended from six months to one year. In addition a review will be required before a mentally ill inmate is released. The law, dating from 1999, is named for Kendra Webdale, who was pushed to her death in front of a New York City subway train by a man with schizophrenia.
              Protective orders: A judge issuing a protective order who finds a substantial risk that the subject of the order will use a gun against the person protected by the order must require the surrender of the weapon.
              Safe storage: The law requires safe storage of firearms in households where individuals live who have been convicted of a crime, involuntarily committed, or are subject to an order of protection. Existing state law already requires that all guns sold at retail in the state be sold with a gun lock.
              Keeps guns out of schools: The penalty for possession of a firearm on school grounds or a school bus will be increased from a misdemeanor to a felony.
              Tougher penalties for illegal gun use: The legislation establishes a range of tougher penalties for those who use illegal guns as well as measures to help combat gang violence.

“Existing 10-round clips are grandfathered, but may only be loaded with seven rounds.”

The stupidity of NY law makers is unbelievable.

But the nut won't be able to use a high capacity clip from out of State.  And if he legally obtains a 10 shot clip he will only be able to put 7 bullets in it.  So the Governor believes.  He said the "progressive" State of NY is now safe.

Wonderful.  We can buy 10 round clips but only load them with 7 bullets to protect ourselves and our families..  The Gov. is right is he not?  This does not restrict legal gun owner rights? The ingenious legislation will save lives because the criminal can no longer fill the clip up before he goes on a shooting spree.  What?  Not to mention that 80% of guns used by criminals in NYS come from out of state to begin with.  Legal pistol permit holders have not been committing the crimes to begin with.

There should be a mandatory provision within these laws requiring a statement in the bill jacket describing exactly what the law WILL accomplish. Five years after passage, the law should be reviewed and if the objectives are not accomplished or the legislation does not address the supposed problem, every single individual voting for the law should be arrested and put in prison at hard labor for a period of not less than thirty years.

This is a joke, a background check for Ammo Sales?  Tracking Ammo Sales? State Police Alerts if you purchase too many rounds.

I trust our government as much as our founding father's trusted the government they just created--which is why they also created the Bill of Rights.

My guess in that people will stop going to psychologist and other mental health therapists since they are now not able to freely express their mind.

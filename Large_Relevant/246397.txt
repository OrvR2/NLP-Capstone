KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Taliban suicide bombers attacked the gates of the Afghan intelligence agency Wednesday, killing one person and wounding dozens in a blast that shredded nearby cars and shattered storefront windows three blocks away.
The brazen midday attack highlighted ongoing violence in Afghanistan and the determination of the insurgency to continue fighting even as President Hamid Karzai and the U.S. negotiate for a quicker pullout of American forces.
A minivan drove into a gate of the intelligence agency compound in the capital at noon and exploded in a blast that was heard throughout downtown. A second minivan pulled up, and five attackers wearing explosive vests jumped out and tried to storm the gate, police said.
Security forces killed the five attackers and defused explosives found in the second van, police said in a statement.
It was the second attack targeting the intelligence agency in as many months. On Dec. 6, a Taliban suicide bomber posing as a peace messenger blew himself up while meeting with Afghan intelligence chief Asadullah Khalid inside a Kabul residence. Khalid has been hospitalized in the United States with serious wounds since then.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the latest assault in a text message sent to The Associated Press. The Taliban insurgency regularly targets Afghan army and police, but attacks against the intelligence agency show the group's ability to strike even those who are supposedly closely monitoring their activities.
One intelligence service guard was killed in the blast, said agency spokesman Shafiqullah Tahiri. He did not provide any information on guards who were wounded.
Mohammad Zahir, the chief of the Kabul police investigation unit, said at least 30 people suffered injuries. Tahiri said some of those injuries were minor, but four of the wounded were in critical condition.
The attack comes less than a week after Karzai returned from a trip to the United States in which he pushed the U.S. to get its troops out of Afghan villages. During the visit, both sides seemed ready to consider a much smaller American force in Afghanistan after 2014 than had previously been envisioned.
Karzai said on his return that Afghanistan would be safer once the U.S. troops leave. But Wednesday's attack was a stark reminder that Afghan forces are as much a target as foreign troops.
After Wednesday's blast, ambulances were able to carry some of the wounded to hospitals, while others were loaded into the back of a pickup truck. Blood streamed down the face of one man, staining his white-collared shirt and sweater vest as he waited for an ambulance.
The blast left the twisted wreckage of at least seven cars on the street, while the windows of nearby shops were blown out and glass shards littered the pavement blocks away.
A heavy snow started to fall as uniformed intelligence agents cordoned off the area around the gate. The blast walls at the entrance were blackened from the explosion and metal pieces — apparently the remains of the entrance gate — were twisted and strewn about.
The entire intelligence service compound is surrounded by tall, thick cement walls designed to protect buildings from bomb blasts.
Attacks in the heavily secured Afghan capital are less common than in the country's restive south, but they do occur and are often more sophisticated operations. They frequently include multiple attackers trying to penetrate the perimeter of armed guards and blast walls that surround government buildings and embassies.
The most recent attack in Kabul was on Dec. 17, when a car bomber struck outside a compound used by a U.S. military contractor. That blast killed at least two Afghan workers and wounded more than a dozen people.
A spokesman for the international military coalition, Maj. Martyn Crighton, said  Afghan forces responded to the attack and that NATO forces were not involved.

That some people would actually want to be suicide/homocide bombers only shows the great amount of harm that is done in the mosques and madrassas by theimams's and mullah's who mind program their students[victims] into the Islamic belief from the Quran of some kind of paradise with many virgins in it for the jihadist who dies for the cause of Islam. The origin of the Islamic doctrine that it was fables from Arabian and Zoroastrine mythology fused together and inserted into the Quran by wicked men and is now part of the hoax of Islam. This type of myth /doctrine of a place with virgins was and the false teachers, the imams' and mullah's, of it was predicted in the Bible.  Which reads "The time will come when they will not stand wholesome teaching, but will follow their own fancy and gather a crowd of teachers to tickle their ears. They will stop their ears to the truth and turn to mythology." Second Timothy 4:3,4. [NEB].    Furthermore, another way this may be put is from another  version ofthe Bible. Which warns "Neither give heed to fables..." First Timothy 1:4. [KJV]

My son is in this area and it breaks my heart to read this stuff. But what breaks it more, is that most Americans have really forgotten the troops over there. Sad, sad, sad! Yet the man that sits in that big white house has no problem in taking their benefits and pay, along with the seniors but will allow congress a $900.00 a month increase. Messed up...yup!

Where do the taliban get such demented people willing to blow themselves up? Don't tell me they believe in this 92 virgins waiting for them in heaven stuff.At the rate they are killing themselves all over ,even their Allah would be hard put to provide that many virgins.Unless it includes animals and such.Only virgins are mentioned [ if I am not wrong]in their scripture.No mention of what sort.

This terrible thing that happen in Afghanistan is , for the most part, the result of the mind programing by the imam's and mullah's of the student's [victims] in the mosques and madrassas of the Islamic doctrine from the Quran of a paradise with many virgins in it for the jihadist who dies for the cause of Islam. This false doctrine that so thoroughly brainwashed into the hearts and minds of others has its real origin in fusion of Arabian and Zoroastrine mythology which was inserted in the the Quran and other works of Islam which the Islamic clerics indoctrinate into their students as "divine truth."  Such is part of the hoax of Islam. 
Furthermore, the Bible has predicted such false teachers and these imam's and mullah's with this type of teaching. For the Bible reads "For the time will come when they will not stand wholesome teaching, but will follow their own fancy and gather a crowd of teachers to tickle their ears. They will stop their ears to the truth and turn to mythology."
Second Timothy 4:3,4. [NEB]

just look at the number of comments on this page, this shows you the interest that Americans have in this. Really gets my goat. But if it was Hollywood stuff, the page would be covered with comments and interest. We as Americans are doing a dis-service to ourselves.

The reader might very well notice that it's never the imam's and mullah's who actually go out and commit the suicide bombings All the Islamic clerics do is brainwash other people into the mindset of actually wanting to be a suicide/homocide bomber. All at the same time thes same Muslim clerics who did the mind programing sit home safe.  This in itself say a lot about the real character of these imam's and mullah's.

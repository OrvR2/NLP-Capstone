http://www.euronews.com/ Timbuktu airport has been seized and secured by French and Malian troops. Backed by airpower around 1200 soldiers have now launched an offensive to take the city.A senior military officer reported they met no resistance at the airport though they uncovered a series of improvised explosive devices. One unnamed member said they were laid by people who knew what they were doing.  "The whole device was set up cleanly, the connections were done correctly, the whole system was ready to work. It was an expert job, it was not the work of amateurs, that's clear," he said. The advance into the ancient city has prompted French President Francois Hollande to tell a news conference on Monday, "we are winning this battle". His words come with reports Islamists fleeing Timbuktu set fire to homes and thousands of priceless manuscripts.There are claims from the secular Tuareg rebel commanders they are now in control of the northern town of Kidal after Islamist militant fighters abandoned it.Kidal is the capital of a remote region which borders Algeria. It was one of the last suburban strongholds of the militants. Human Rights Watch has raised concerns that members of the Malian military may be settling old scores during their offensive. Images have been released showing dead bodies at the bottom of a well.African and international leaders will meet on Tuesday in Addis Ababa for a donors conference.Meanwhile British Foreign Secretary William Hague has said the UK would not be sending combat troops to Mali.Find us on:  Youtube http://bit.ly/zr3upY Facebook http://www.facebook.com/euronews.fansTwitter http://twitter.com/euronews

Another TROLL, ZERO own videos since you opened the channel four years ago.
95% of all users who answer my comments have TROLL channels like yours therefore only a mentally retarded video creator would ever bother interacting﻿ with TROLLS like yourself.
Have a nice life, TROLL.

Last time I checked Iraq wasn't invaded by islamists and didn't invite the US to defend them in 2003.
Your logic is flawed; Operation "Iraqi Freedom"﻿ was no more similar to "Serval" then to operation "Overlord" in 1944. Ask actual Malians what they think about it instead of making ridiculous inflammatory comments.

also "UN Security Council Resolution 1441 of Nov 8, 2002" was taken as a excuse by the USA, while nothing stated in the Resolution to give a reason for war was true at all﻿ in the end. (hoax of wmd..)

Iraq -﻿ Regime was peaceful to its neighbours past 10yrs, didn't had civil war, just a Revenge war.
Mali - Regime was under pressure from Terrorists coming thru the Sahara(a real reason for war against terror lol), has a civil war condition since the fighters are not in uniform, plus had a UN Mandate approval.

@401RoadWarrior Maybe you didn't hear me? I said we had a UN Resolution while the US didn't. That is the difference and we never go to﻿ war without one.

"French public approves Mali action by 76%"
But they went ballistic against Bush and Iraq War, personally I see no ideological﻿ difference btwn Operation Iraqi FREEDOM and Operation Serval, a military INVASION is a military INVASION no matter he is leading it. Apparently French ppl pick and chose which military invasions are working in THEIR favor.
"and 100% in Congress"
2003, France Amb to UN Dominique de Villepin, Saddam Hussein's loudest voice and his strongest defence lawyer
Continued...

So the KURDS in Northern Iraq.
Differences in political﻿ leaderships:
- Bush, conservative, texan, pro-traditional marriage, anti-abortion, anti-unions, anti-universal healthcare, pro-death penalty, etc. as per 2003 major American domestic issues
- Francois Hollande, SOCIALIST, pro-homo marriage, pro-abortion, pro-union, pro-large govt spending as per 2013 France domestic issues.
Wonder IF Sarkozy was still France Pres LIBERAL media AND French ppl would have openly agreed with the Mali INVASION.

French public approves Mali action by﻿ 76% and 100% in Congress.
It is approved by UN mandate.
US did not get a mandate in Iraq.
Malian government asked for French assistance.

Truly what life what was like back in the best days of Rock and Roll. Friends gettin' together, gettin' high, bon fire parties and laughter among ourselves, everyone was welcome. Sticky fingers from smokin', one-hitter's, rolling our own joints. Listening to Humble Pie made it just more﻿ to rockin'! Love it! Thanks for the memories!

Kinda makes the Black Crowes sound like a cover band. Never realized it till I heard this one.﻿ Thought they were just giving Rod Stewart and the Faces a nod.

not to act like i know everything but i've doing heroin since the 60's i will not say where i started plus other drugs.I haven't seen thai sticks since the early 80s plus no brown dope comes from the middle or far east,all that black tar and brown shit is from mexico=s.america.There was nothing like the old china white and turkish smack!Also if you didn't put opium in your weed the drug dealers weren't and you only waste heroin in﻿ a joint,you smoke chasing the dragon on alum.foil+a straw...

I used to buy Lebanese fingers whick was rolled like straws﻿ then stuck together to form an ounce. I also bought a "plate" from Kabul, had the official seal and all, that had the white lines in it. You could but #1 or #2 Thai sticks #1 was dipped in Heroin #2 was dipped in opium. Either way you wake up tomorrow haha.

Very sad the way Steve Marriot died. Just got back home to England after a trip to CA where he was working with Frampton(didn't work out and Steve left) Got off the plane, drank too much and had jet lag- passed out with a lit cigarette in his hand and caught the house (his sisters I think?) on fire. He was there alone and died from smoke asphyxiation. I may have a detail or two wrong but basically...Very sad. Such talent. Such a tortured soul.﻿ RIP Steve

There was a war going on between the US and the British in the 60's and 70's. A music war. Even though there was no﻿ losers, there were winners. ALL OF US. Thanks for the music and the memories.

Steve Marriott's voice was the one that lured me into real stompin rockinroll! There was nothing like a live Humble Pie concert on a hot summer night on the Asbury Park Boardwalk in 1973. Velvet capes, rhinestone mushroom pins, platform boots and THAT was NIRVANA, I assure you, ladies and gentlemen. Too bad that this clip is NOT the song we're hearing. But matters not﻿ - the spirit is taken.

The Lyrics are incredible, a dirty room & a Silver Coke Spoon, Give me my release...
This is Rock N Roll.
Chicago Green, talkin' 'bout Black Lebanese
A dirty room and a silver coke spoon

Black napalese, it's got you weak in your knees
Sneeze some dust that you got﻿ buzzed on
You know it's hard to believe

in the on going reverence for this song and Sir SM I have searched and found lyrics translations which say that Newcastle Brown (which﻿ smacks you down) refers to an English beer but fails to note that "brown" and "smack" were common US slang for something entirely different and that is heroin -- maybe hidden behind a beer

my parents used to play this song all the time. I never understood its meaning at the time. I used to thing Marriot was saying "Dirty Dave & and the﻿ Hose". I thought he was working in the garden or washing his car. Oh the innocence of youth!! Now its set as my ringtone!

I saw these guys in the mid '70s, very good show. Is the reference in this song to New Castle Brown referring to New Castle Brown Ale? We﻿ always wondered when we were teens what they were referring to.

Yes, I think the reference is to New Castle Brown Ale. Chicago Green (marijuana) and Black Lebanese and Black﻿ Nepalese hash are also mentioned...

I could be wrong but, I'm not so sure the Black Lebanese and the Black Nepalese are both referring to hash. We used to get black Lebanese hash but, the Black Nepalese we used to get was opium, or as the media calls it "black tar heroin". Man, that smell would linger in your car﻿ for a couple of weeks.

You know,, now that I think about it.﻿ The stuff we got was a combination of hash with opium in it, very black and extremely sticky. It was hard to get it off your fingers so we usually handled it with a knife. Good times, /-)

Assumed then it was a herion﻿ reference as in Mexican Brown / China White. Especially since he says "it can sure SMACK you DOWN in regard to Newcastle Brown. There may be a brown ale there, there are in many places but my guess due to times and who's singing (no offense to Steve,love him that's why I'm here; saw them live 72) is the brown going around is not' specifically, brew but another potion not a libation. At least the brew gives them coverage for an inside joke.

@craiglouis; When I was a teen we wondered what it meant. We thought it probably meant something along the lines of your comment. A few years ago I saw New Castle Brown Ale and wondered if that was it. What ever it means, thanks for the reply.

you and others could well be right, the brown "rocks" was a cruder form of H compared to the White Chase (China white). The rush from rocks would really "smack you down" compared to the﻿ powder. Hence "smack" became slang for Heroin. Yep, the late sixties, early seventies was riddled from Viet vets bring it in. makes sense ...

It was common to cover drug references so it could be interpreted two ways. A﻿ song that makes you wonder is preferable to no intrigue. In Steve's lead vocal on 'Rock On' (Strange Days?) he says "and my brown dope..". No one called weed brown dope. A song with all other reference to drugs & landing in jail wouldn't list a drug considered to be their father's generation's drug. I rest my case. However we hear it it's cool we're still listening to the great music of that period!

My mom had a friend who was a former hippie who turned me onto this music in the 80's. I remember he was like.. "you wanna hear my albums?" and I thought, " I don't think so" but after a listen I was hooked. I needed something to ground me musically at that time cuz it was the 80's you know...big hair, hairspray, florescent colors, Madonna. Thanks Richard.﻿

Modern "rock" doesn't even come close to what we had in the 70's and early 80's. Very, very few current "artists" wish they had﻿ the raw talent, spontaneity, diverse influence and inspiration that these real musicians from that era had.
EVERY DAY I thank my folks for timing me just right, born in 62' and growing up with ALL of this.
If you are a kid and listen to this...great!! Thank YouTube for letting you experience it, if only on video. Learn it, respect it, love it.

Hey, being born in '62 you probably heard a lot of great music, but being 15 in the mid 70's was maybe even better...all the great bands...Zep, Sabbath, Aeorsmith, Uriah Heep, Robin Trower, Spooky﻿ Tooth, Edgar Winter, Johnny Winter, I could go on and on, but one thing is for sure, rock and roll is great! If you really want to har a great song, look up Uriah Heep "Rock and Roll Medly"...great stuff.

THANKS, ghostryder8567!!! This tune was stuck in my head for the past few days. Only one way to cure that...gin and tonics or play the song! A true classic Rock-n-SoulBlues song from the gravelly voice himself, Mr. Steve Marriott. Now, where is my copy of 'Humble Pie' live on "King Biscuit Flower Hour" cd?﻿

GOOD POST. Nothing wrong with setting the record straight﻿ man. Peter and Steve made a good team, imagine the future of Humble Pie if those 2 stayed together.

Frampton is a great guitarist. But The Pie got﻿ BETTER after he left. Harder, louder, more rock your fuckin' face off!!! Smokin' is the Pie's finest.

I agree with you. Frampton's style was more of jazz solos, "Clem" Clempson was﻿ more energetic.

Yeah, there is a youtube video of Humble Pie doing Shaky Jake from '69. Frampton﻿ had a three pick-up guitar with a nice loud and punchy sound.to it. I have no idea what kind of guitar that was. Can't see the brand name in the video. But yeah, Clempson's guitar was the one that rocked the spiders in the far corners of the stadium when they did live. Too bad Deep Purple turned Clempson down. I think he would have been perfect.

Do you mean the Bilzen Festival video from '69? I think Frampton plays Gretsch Duo Jet in it. The other "Shaky Jake" is a Beat Club video and it's from 1970- not '69. Someone wrote the wrong date in a Beat Club footage. (Also Natural Born Bugie video is not from '68, but from '69, and I Don't Need No Doctor is probably from '73- not '71- the youtubers messed up with the dates ;-)
But answering the question, Pete's guitar in The Beat Club video is Gibson﻿ SG Custom from 1962.

part two ;)
so when they started HP, Steve and Pete played Gretsch at first, then Marriott switched﻿ to Epiphone Dwight and Frampton to Gibson SG. In 1970 Peter got Black Beauty from the fan so after that he switched from SG to 1954 LP Custom (Black Beauty).

...the reason u say that is because frampton used/uses alot of major scales in his playing..clempson used mostly blues scales...Frampton along w only a few others used major scales in a rock context..The beauty of Frampton is that he made/makes major scales﻿ sound very bluesy...

Can't say I disagree.. FRampton was better on his own... and Humble Pie, as you stated, got heavier ...
I used to have King﻿ Buscuit show on CD from the post Frampton era that was AMAZING.... it also became VERY clear to me where Paul Stanley borrowed his onstage persona from...

Why they 'didn't want' Frampton? Where did you hear that? Iwas under the impression that Frampton simply left to do﻿ solo work. He even kept the same manager as Humble Pie. I never heard anything along the lines of 'didn't want him' before.

My parents both graduated in 1976 from high schools in Detroit and they have told me great stories of it being like Rock N Roll High School. They also said Humble Pie was some of the most real shit out there. I graduated from HS in 2004, and it wasn't exactly rock n roll high school, but there was plenty of pot smoking, ecstasy popping and a lot of SEX goin on..﻿ I'm glad I partook it the festivities when I could!

I know things were a whole﻿ lot different then, to get busted on seeds and dust, but never knew what Newcastle Brown was. or if you check wikipedia, the dope This song (like all are) is a snapshot in history, and it happens to be a very good song. A point int in history where we can never revisit. just as we can step into the river, but it flows and won't be the same before or after. Just that one perfect moment when we are in it. Thanks.

Thanks for the reply, I'm sure it was his favorite ale, but the song is coy with a different connotation. Check the comments﻿ on Songfacts for this song.

You got that right. I saw them in Detroit in 1981 shortly after Marriott served time for possession. They were still wild men﻿ then.

Yeah, I wasn't around yet when all that great music came out, but I know a little something about it. If you sing a song about going to jail, doing drugs, and hookers, you are bound to be in a wild band. My generation may be falling for today's music, but I grew up listening to this stuff on my parents' radios. Anyway, I love﻿ Humble Pie and this is a great song. RIP Steve Marriott.

One of﻿ the best bands ever!! Marriott has a hell of a voice. I remember back in the day when Smokin was released. I rode my bike down to the record store to buy it. What has happen to the music of today, Gosh I sound old. Thanks for sharing this, It brings back so many memories.

One of my first concerts I saw in the early 70's. And boy, did they﻿ rock! I was used to hearing bad "live" albums, so I thought it would sound bad. They played at Music Hall (great acoustics) and just blew me away! The one guy said to me it's always best to hear groups live. But they had much better sound systems in the 70's.

Playing this song is like a rhythmic hot volley between the﻿ 5 and 1 chords in the Key of A. The occasional 4 and 2 chords round it out at points but at it's heart it's the back and forth hot volley between 1 and 5 that fuel this hard blues song :)

Steve is one of the all time great voices in rock. And what a freakin' slammin' tune and band. SO much heavier than most﻿ of today's metal shit!

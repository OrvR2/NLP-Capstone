Wow! You have never been in Brazil and talks as if you know everything about a country as huge and diverse﻿ as yours! All you know or have seen are stupid images filmed and edited by silly foreigners who like to perpetuate the stereotype that you have in mind. Just like they do in India, Middle East, etc). That's so acurate as a Brazilian thinking that all Americans are stupid fat redneck pigs! When in fact, only 50% are!

You should know yours and be more respectful with﻿ people who help you when you're broken. We're the world's number one market also for shops in USA (more than US$ 3 billions spent last year only in NY). You should care about your rare friends, being nice at least when a tragedy happens.

Sorry.﻿ I presumed that you would understand a little something called 'respect'. You'd think it would be bigger than the right (or will) of saying whatever comes to your head, but of course not.

So everyone whose opinions you disagree with aren't entitled to posting them? Seems you aren't tolerant of freedom of speech. More﻿ people die everyday to the flu than the number of dummies who died in the nightclub fire.

I can﻿ handle your opinion, I just don't like it. Is that a crime now? To see 233 people die all at once in a tragedy and not even flinch is not the problem here. Your comments about it are the problem. You can have any opinion you want, but your attitude makes YOU the intolerant jerk.

Michele Cardoso, 20, died in the fire at Brazilian club Kiss after pleading for help on Facebook
A student who died in a blaze which ripped through a Brazilian nightclub posted a message on Facebook pleading for help, it was reported today.Michele Cardoso, 20, was in the Kiss nightclub in Santa Maria, southern Brazil, when a fire started which left 234 people dead and 106 injured.The medical student, who also worked part-time in the club's cloakrooms, had been at party 
for local university students with her sister Clarissa and boyfriend 
Joao Paulo. None got out alive.Inspectors believe the blaze began when a
band's small pyrotechnics show ignited foam sound insulating material 
on the ceiling, releasing a putrid haze that caused scores of university
students to choke to death.It comes as police arrested one of the owners of the nightclub, Elissandro Spohr, as well as the lead singer of the band Gurizada Fandangueira which was playing at the time the fire broke out, and the band's security man.An arrest warrant has been issued for the other co-owner of the Kiss nightclub Mauro Hoffman, who is now considered a fugitive of justice.The band's vocalist, Marcelo Santos, was detained this morning while he was attending the wake of his fellow band member who died in the blaze, Danilo Jacques.At 3.20am on Saturday morning, 50 minutes after the fire is reported to have started, Ms Cardoso posted a message on Facebook using her mobile phone which read: 'Fire at KISS help'.

Over the following hours alarmed friends left increasingly desperate replies asking if she was alright, but her posts fell silent.After Ms Cardoso was confirmed as among the dead, one friend wrote on her page: 'I never imagined that it was serious when I first saw her asking for help on Facebook in the early hours, until I woke up with a message from my mum telling me what had happened.'Her father Sandro Cardoso took to Facebook yesterday to tell nightclub boss Elissandro 'Kiko' Spohr that he should move away from Santa Maria.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS...

don't have any idea of my pain this message goes to you and your family 
because the pain I'm feeling is inexplicable (sic)."
Meanwhile it was revealed today that most of the victims of Sunday morning's tragedy had died in the club's bathrooms.Some reports claimed desperate revellers had mistaken the toilet signs for those for the emergency exit.Santa Maria's military police chief Edi Garcia said he had taken more than 180 bodies from inside the toilets.He said: 'The scene was terrible, so said to see. There were so many young people, and the space was very small.

'I
took more than 180 people from the restrooms. They had run there trying
to escape. The truck which was taking the bodies away had to come back 
five times to be filled up again. The scene was so sad.'Most victims died from smoke inhalation rather than burns in what appeared to be the world's deadliest nightclub fire in more than a decade.One of the owners of the club is reported to have confirmed that they were in the process of renewing its licence to operate, and that its fire safety certificate had expired last year.He is said to have received threats on the internet - as have surviving members of Gurizada Fandangueira.Around 100 victims of the fatal nightclub blaze in Santa Maria, southern Brazil, are to be buried today, according to reports.The city's Ecumenical Cemetery opened at 7.30am and will be conducting burials every half an hour, staff confirmed

Meanwhile, around 80 people remain in a critical condition in hospital after inhaling toxic fumes, according to the city's health minister Alexandre Padilha. Thirty-seven of those have been transferred to specialist units in the state capital, Porto Alegre.He added than more than 300 people had been treated at hospitals around Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's southernmost state.He said: 'We spent the whole night accompanying patients who were in hospital. The main objective was to save as many victims as possible.'The second objective is to help relieve the suffering of the victims' families. Psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers are in the gymnasium (where bodies were taken), in hospitals and in help centres. Just yesterday there were nearly 200 psychological consultations with relatives of victims.'VIDEO Family and friends identify their loved ones as the nation mourns

Regional police chief Marcelo Arigony said he had already heard testimonies of 17 people, including the club's co-owners, Mauro Hoffman and Elissandro Spohr.Police have also reportedly taken away fire extinguishers from the venue following reports security guards and band members tried to use them to put out the fire but none were working.Mr Arigony added: 'I have very preliminary information that security guards did close the club's doors. But it wasn't in bad faith, since some guards also died.'Last night the club posted a statement of their Facebook page claiming they were collobarating with police but insisting their staff "possessed the highest technical qualification'.'In this first moment, the priority of the house is provide all necessary assistance to the survivors and families of those who died. And this is being done by providing information and the assistance of a multidisplinary team (psychologists, doctors, social workers etc.'Survivors and the police inspector Marcelo Arigony said security guards briefly tried to block people from exiting the club.

But Mr Arigony said the guards did not appear to block fleeing patrons for long.'It was chaotic and it doesn't seem to have been done in bad faith because several security guards also died,' he said.Later, firefighters responding to the blaze initially had trouble getting inside the Kiss nightclub because 'there was a barrier of bodies blocking the entrance', Guido Pedroso Melo, commander of the city's fire department, told the O Globo newspaper.Authorities said band members who were on the stage when the fire broke out later talked with police and confirmed they used pyrotechnics during their show.Police inspector Sandro Meinerz, who co-ordinated the investigation at the nightclub, said one band member died after escaping because he returned inside the burning building to save his accordion.The other band members escaped alive because they were the first to notice the fire.'It was terrible inside - it was like one of those films of the Holocaust, bodies piled on top of one another,' said Mr Meinerz.'We had to use trucks to remove them. It took about six hours to take the bodies away.'Television images from Santa Maria, a university city of about 260,000 people, showed black smoke billowing out of the Kiss nightclub as shirtless young men who attended the university party joined firefighters using axes and sledgehammers to pound at the hot-pink exterior walls, trying to reach those trapped inside. 

These were the dramatic scenes moments after a fire engulfed the nightclub, in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, killing at least 233 people by suffocation and trampling and leaving 133 injured

 Bodies of the dead and injured were strewn in the street and panicked screams filled the air as medics tried to help. There was little to be done; officials said most of those who died were suffocated by smoke within minutes.Within hours a community gym was a horror scene, with body after body lined up on the ground, partially covered with black plastic as family members identified kin.Outside the gym police held up personal objects - a black purse, a blue high-heeled shoe - as people seeking information on loved ones crowded around, hoping not to recognise anything being shown them.Teenagers sprinted from the scene after the fire began, desperately seeking help. Others carried injured and burned friends away in their arms. Many of the victims were under 20 years old, including some minors. About half of those killed were men, about half women.The party was organised by students from several academic departments from the Federal University of Santa Maria. Such organised university parties are common throughout Brazil.'There was so much smoke and fire, it was complete panic, and it took a long time for people to get out, there were so many dead,' survivor Luana Santos Silva told the Globo TV network.The fire spread so fast inside the packed club that firefighters and ambulances could do little to stop it, Silva said.Another survivor, Michele Pereira, told the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper that she was near the stage when members of the band lit some sort of flare that started the conflagration.'The band that was on-stage began to use flares and, suddenly, they stopped the show and pointed them upward," she said. VIDEO  Amateur video shows firefighters battling nightclub blaze

'At that point, the ceiling caught fire. It was really weak, but in a matter of seconds it spread.'Guitarist Rodrigo Martins told Radio Gaucha that the band, Gurizada Fandangueira, started playing at 2.15am 'and we had played around five songs when I looked up and noticed the roof was burning'.'It might have happened because of the Sputnik, the machine we use to create a luminous effect with sparks. It's harmless, we never had any trouble with it,' he said.'When the fire started, a guard passed us a fire extinguisher, the singer tried to use it but it wasn't working.'He confirmed that accordion player Danilo Jacques, 28, died, while the five other members made it out safely.Police Major Cleberson Braida Bastianello said by telephone that the toll had risen to 233 with the death of a victim in hospital.He said earlier that the death toll was likely made worse because the nightclub appeared to have just one exit through which patrons could exit.

Officials earlier counted 232 bodies that had been brought for identification to a gymnasium in Santa Maria, which is located at the southern tip of Brazil, near the borders with Argentina and Uruguay.Federal Health Minister Alexandre Padhilha told a news conference that most of the 117 people treated in hospitals had been poisoned by gases they breathed during the fire. Only a few suffered serious burns, he said.Brazil president Dilma Rousseff arrived to visit the injured after cutting short her trip to a Latin American-European summit in Chile.'It is a tragedy for all of us,' Ms Rousseff said.Most of the dead apparently were asphyxiated, according to Dr Paulo Afonso Beltrame, a professor at the medical school of the Federal University of Santa Maria who went to the city's Caridade Hospital to help victims.Dr Beltrame said he was told the club had been filled far beyond its capacity.

Devastation: Relatives of victims cry in the street after news of the fire is made public
Survivors, police and firefighters gave the same account of a band member setting the ceiling's soundproofing ablaze, he said.'Large amounts of toxic smoke quickly filled the room, and I would say that at least 90% of the victims died of asphyxiation," Dr Beltrame said."The toxic smoke made people lose their sense of direction so they were unable to find their way to the exit. At least 50 bodies were found inside a bathroom. Apparently they confused the bathroom door with the exit door."In the hospital, the doctor 'saw desperate friends and relatives walking and running down the corridors looking for information", he said, calling it 'one of the saddest scenes I have ever witnessed'.Rodrigo Moura, identified by the newspaper Diario de Santa Maria as a security guard at the club, said it was at its maximum capacity of between 1,000 and 2,000, and partygoers were pushing and shoving to escape.Santa Maria mayor Cezar Schirmer declared a 30-day mourning period, and Tarso Genro, the governor of the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, said officials were investigating the cause of the disaster.The blaze was the deadliest in Brazil since at least 1961, when a fire that swept through a circus killed 503 people in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro.Santa Maria, at the southern tip of 
Brazil near the borders with Argentina and Uruguay, is a major 
university city with a population of around a quarter of a million.

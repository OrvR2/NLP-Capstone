India

                            India (i/ˈɪndiə/), officially the Republic of India (Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by geographical area, the second-most populous country with over 1.2 billion people, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the south-west, and the Bay of Bengal on the south-east, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north-east; and Burma and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; in addition, India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.

Home to the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history. Four of the world's major religions—Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism—originated here, whereas Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived in the 1st millennium CE and also helped shape the region's diverse culture. Gradually annexed by and brought under the administration of the British East India Company from the early 18th century and administered directly by the United Kingdom from the mid-19th century, India became an independent nation in 1947 after a struggle for independence that was marked by non-violent resistance led by Mahatma Gandhi.

Joy debuted opposite Sadhana in the film Love in Simla (1960) directed by R.K. Nayyar. After Love in Simla, he paired with Asha Parekh for several hits like Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon, Love in Tokyo and Ziddi. By the late 1960s acting roles began drying up, so he began directing and producing.

He produced and directed Humsaaya although neither that film nor his subsequent films as producer or director did well. Despite a late success with home production Ek Baar Muskura Do (1972) with brother Deb Mukherjee and later to be sister-in-law Tanuja, Joy faded from the silver screen. His last success came directing Chailla Babu. In 2009 he acted in the television serial Aye Dil-e-Nadan.[citation needed]

Inspector, El relato


Mirame, estoy tratando de decirte a ti, que el amarte asi no es confidencia, que sin ti  no puedo vivir.El no tenerte, perra la suerte, es como sentirse en el frio sin tu abrigo esperanzas abiertas me recuerdan, me recuerdan que tu no estas.Flor marchita que adornas el recuerdo de un viejo amor dame la fuerza para poder enterrar este dolor.Oh, ah terminado, qeuda triste el corazon. Oh ah terminado, otro relato de amor. (Se repite)


Inspector, Ska Voovee Boobie Bady


Son muy grandes las razones que me hacen suspirarCada vez que yo te miro me gustas mas y másAdoro tu cadera perfecta en tu cinturaPero al mirar tu pecho sube la temperaturaPorque cuando estas bailando cuando tu estas sonriendoanuncias que en el cielo otro ángel va perdiendoNaciste siendo reina naciste consentiday mientras yo soñando que algún día serás míaCORODe arriba para abajo de abajo para arriba,y ya bonita estoy siguiéndote la pistaDe abajo para arriba de arriba para abajo,y tengo que decirte que ya estoy enamorado........... 2 vecesSka Voovee Boobie Bady.........4 vecesEscucha como late mi corazónSka Voovee Boobie Bady.........3 vecesEscucha como late mi corazónTengo que decirtetengo que contartemuero por tu amorSabes que te quierosabes lo que siento de esta situación.......2 vecesO dime veras semana tras semanaEsperando tu respuesta y gastándome la plata..........2 vecesSígueme, sígueme, síguemediciendo que me quieresSígueme, sígueme, síguemeque ya no pierda el tiempo buscando otras mujeresSígueme, sígueme, síguemediciendo que me adorasSígueme, sígueme, síguemeque siempre estas pensando en mi a toda horaCORO...........


Inspector, No piensa en ti


Mirate..., te veo felizme pregunto como y cuandofue que te perdíMirame.. estoy aquino he ganado ni perdidosolo estoy sin tíCada paso que das en la ciudadsin dar la cara a los demasocultandote  bien del que dirany mostrandote fuerte cuando es necesariobuscas motivos para llamarala en dias festivoste arrepientes ya lo notamoses que sigues de ella enamoradoya no le llores másya no le llores másya no llores, ya no llores amigopor que dices que son cosas de niñosya no le llores másya no le llores másya no llores, ya no llores hermanopor que finges que nunca te hizo dañoMirala se ve tan feliz...No piensa en tiCada paso que das en la ciudadsin dar la cara a los demasocultandote  bien del que dirany mostrandote fuerte cuando es necesariobuscas motivos para llamarala en dias festivoste arrepientes ya lo notamosy es que sigues de ella enamoradoya no le llores másya no le llores másya no llores, ya no llores amigopor que dices que son cosas de niñosya no le llores másya no le llores másya no llores, ya no llores hermanopor que finges que nunca te hizo dañoMirala se ve tan feliz...No piensa en ti, No piensa en tiNo piensa en ti, no, no..Olvidala


Inspector, blanco y negro


No hay suficiente espacio para los dos,sabes de que hablo y tengo razón,no puedo compartir tu idea de prejuiciosni el que exista una raza superior.Quizá tu nunca te hayas puesto a pensarque entre latinos no debemos pelear,hay  gente que no entiende estoque lo importante no es el colorBlanco y Negro en el cielo o infiernote aseguro tienen el mismo futuro,solo polvo queda absurda es tu pelea,pero si insistes soy tu primer problema.Te dices soldado de una guerra si cuartelimitando fracasos nunca vas a crecer,el respeto no se gana sin trabajartodos tenemos derecho a la libertad.


Inspector, Sombras en el frio


Existe gente que nunca habla, viven sueñan donde no hay nada, la pobreza es compañera el morir quiza esperanza, hambre y vicio en su camino de la calle el gambusino, caras tristes olvidadas, llevan cansancio en su mirada.Existe gente que nunca escucha, viven solos en su lucha, esperando con paciencia a que termina la indiferencia.No hay destino aquí ni dioses que adorar, solo sombras en el frío buscando humanidad


Inspector, Puedo apostar


Otra vez la luna se pone frente a míPara invitarme a apostar que esta noche como las otras no llegarás.Una carta y tus fotos son los testigosQue tu recuerdo está mas vivo que yo.Y no es el hecho de que cada nocheMis manos me pregunten que en donde estasY no es el hecho de buscarte a tientas sabiendo que no estás.Es la manera que te extraño, que no me acostumbro a pensar,A pensarte y no besarte.Puedo apostar que esta noche no voy a perder.


Inspector, Por una Mujer


Por una mujerHey! Whisky y ganas de pelear no son cosas extrañas que pasen,Se viven a diario en historias del bar.Que nos une, condena,difícil creer que los problemas comiencen por una mujer.Así que esto es lo que pasó por una mujer.Ella sabe que no vale la pena cortarse las venas,Pero le divierte el verlos pelear.Dos tipos de larga amistadEncuentran a la nena, la nena ideal.El pleito comienza por decidir que uno se queda y el otro se va.Se calienta el ambiente al palabras cruzar.Quién es mejor?. Actúa el alcohol.Así que esto es lo que pasó por una mujer.Ella sabe que no vale la pena cortarse las venas,Pero le divierte el verlos pelear.Hey! Comienzan los golpes, botellas quebrar,Es un manicomio el infierno,La policía empieza a llegar,En esos momentos ya nada está bienAl ver que la nena se vá, se vá, del brazo de otro galán.


Inspector, Aguante


Aguante (versión clubs)Honestamente creen que nos puedan vencer.No nos pueden parar.Es la pasión por los colores de mi club que cada temporada hace que los quiera mas.Puedo reir o puedo llorarnuestra fé está en la cancha y los venimos a alentar con la camiseta pegada al corazón,Queremos ser campeones! nuestro equipo es el mejorOlvidemos el empate, salgamos a ganarSomos la pieza grande jugando fuera o de local.Olvidemos el empate, salgamos a ganar!Que los rivales sientan que en esta barra, en esta barra van a topar.


Inspector, Lejos De Casa


Cuántas veces tuve que caerdarme cuenta de todo el tiempo que he vividolo que he ganado, lo que he perdidolo que he amado, lo que he sufridoy sin embargo sigo aquíme fui sin ti con la esperanza de volver a casay así aprendí que tras las rejas vive la nadacreí saber que la memoria no llegaríay así entendí lo mucho que me haces faltaestoy tratando de salir de aquívoy a volver aunque sea lo último que hagasalir de aquí aunque nadie crea en mí(2x)me fui sin ti con la esperanza de volver a casay así aprendí que tras las rejas vive la nadacreí saber que la memoria no llegaríay así entendí lo mucho que me haces faltaestoy tratando de salir de aquívoy a volver aunque sea lo último que hagasalir de aquí aunque nadie crea en mí(2x)voy a volver aunque sea lo último que haga.......aunque nadie crea en mí.....aunque nadie crea en mí.....

OSHA Small Business Abuse by Inspectors Fines Fraud Extortion

Order: Reorder
Duration: 6:31
Updated: 22 Mar 2012


8/24/2010 Fox Business News - America's Nightly Scoreboard OSHA small business abuse. Inspectors coming after businesses that have never had problems just to find things to fine & bring money into the gov. Included is fines for crooked scaffolding that the inspector did not measure and was proven okay by the contractor. "Hazardous materials" such as brick, cement, sand, & water. Discussed are the notions of cash-strapped agencies, fraud, extortion. Also, one imagines that these federal employees need to generate income to keep their jobs. OSHA is the US government agency for Occupational Health and Safety Administration created in 1970. As any other agency, it has grown beyond it's original purpose, and while it is a necessary agency, many of its rules have grown into abuses. Similar abuses are occurring with restaurant health inspectors, at least in Los Angeles as I've seen -- the inspector will come every month and find more things to fine, often when the owner is not present.

Inspector (1970) Agent 707


				
					Director: Chand Release Date: 1970 (India) An Indian secret agent comes to know that some terrorists are planning to release a deadly gas through the atmosphere that will annihilate anyone who inhales it, including plants and animals. His attempts to pass this information are successful, however, he himself is killed while doing so. The information reaches top authorities, who, after an urgent meeting, decide to assign this matter to their ace Agent 707, Inspector Rajesh. Rajesh is summoned and briefed about this mission, and he sets forth on his way. He meets with a gorgeous young woman named Rita, and both fall in love with each other. Thereafter no matter where Rajesh is, the terrorists seem to find that out, and Rajesh himself is on the run for his life, as well as the life of Rita. With the deadline of the launching of this deadly gas coming closer and closer, will Rajesh be able to put a stop to this, and will he find out who exactly is betraying him? Alka ... Rita Helen ...

					WELL Here's a funny thing...Aliens!!! from a dying world !!! Plotting to conquer Earth!!! What ??...AGAIN???? This time they try to use our own evil scary superstitions and reanimate two dead scientists (Michael Rennie and Karin Dor) so I guess thats the Zombie role filled, but then they use their knowledge to re-animate Other Earth monsters, including the werewolf Waldemar Daninsky, Frankenstein's monster (both played by Jacinto Molina), the Mummy Tao-Tet, (I guess Im-oh-Tep was busy with the franchises movies) and the Vampire Count de Meirhoff (Dracula's day off I??? This movie is NOT to be confused with Dracula Vs Frankenstein which is the movie I THOUGHT I had when I uploaded this. Its still good in the horrible "I dont believe They thought they could actually get away with this). The scenery still has huge teeth marks from all that chewing through the plot. But It does have Michael Rennie! (not feeling Ill) Michael Rennie ... Dr. Odo Warnoff assignement terror Karin Dor ... Maleva Kerstein Craig Hill ... Inspector Tobermann Patty Shepard ... Ilse Ángel del Pozo ... Dr. Kirian (as Angel del Pozo) Manuel de Blas ... Drácula Peter Damon Diana Sorel Gene Reyes ... Pha-ho-tep Ella Gessler

OSHA Small Business Abuse by Inspectors Fines Fraud Extortion


				
					8/24/2010 Fox Business News - America's Nightly Scoreboard OSHA small business abuse. Inspectors coming after businesses that have never had problems just to find things to fine & bring money into the gov. Included is fines for crooked scaffolding that the inspector did not measure and was proven okay by the contractor. "Hazardous materials" such as brick, cement, sand, & water. Discussed are the notions of cash-strapped agencies, fraud, extortion. Also, one imagines that these federal employees need to generate income to keep their jobs. OSHA is the US government agency for Occupational Health and Safety Administration created in 1970. As any other agency, it has grown beyond it's original purpose, and while it is a necessary agency, many of its rules have grown into abuses. Similar abuses are occurring with restaurant health inspectors, at least in Los Angeles as I've seen -- the inspector will come every month and find more things to fine, often when the owner is not present.

					www.imdb.com Director: CV Sridhar Bharat (Rajendra Kumar) is a patriotic young man for whom patriotism does not stop anywhere. He comes to know of the tyrancy of the present ruler's Diwan (Ajit) and he and his colleagues (Soodesh Kumar, Rajendra Nath) rebel. They kidnap Princess Chitralekha (Waheeda Rehman) unknowingly, and call her Jwala. Meanwhile, Bharat's dad (Balraj Sahni) who is the Inspector General, does not approve of Bharat's rebellious nature and decides to arrest him on sight. Bharat's mom (Kamini Kaushal) is torn between the love for her husband and her son. Bharat determination against the Diwan is so strong that he decides to bomb-blast a railway train transporting the Diwan, knowingly that his own dad is also travelling on that train. Will Bharat break his mom's heart by killing his dad and the Diwan? Good acting scores by the entire caste make this movie worth watching. Lyrics by Indivar. Rajendra Kumar ... Bharat Waheeda Rehman ... Jwala / Princess Chitralekha Balraj Sahni ... Inspector General Chandrashekhar, Bharat's dad Ajit ... Diwan Kamini Kaushal ... Bharat's mom Rajendra Nath ...

Inspector is both a police rank and an administrative position, both used in a number of contexts. However, it is not an equivalent rank in each police force.
In Australian police forces, the rank of Inspector is generally the next senior rank from Senior Sergeant and is less senior than a superintendent (in the cases of the Queensland Police and Western Australia Police) or the rank of Chief Inspector in the other Australian police forces. Members holding the rank usually wear an epaulette featuring three silver pips, the same rank badge as a Captain in the army. In addition to the general rank of Inspector, some police forces use other ranks such as Detective Inspector and District Inspector.
In Austria a similar scheme was used as in Germany. At some point the police inspector was completely removed from the list of service ranks. The current police service has an inspectors service track with "Inspektor" being the entry level - it is followed by "Revierinspektor" (precinct inspector), "Gruppeninspektor" (group inspector), "Bezirksinspektor" (county inspector), "Abteilungsinspektor" (office inspector), "Kontrollinspektor" (control inspector) and "Chefinspektor" (chief inspector).

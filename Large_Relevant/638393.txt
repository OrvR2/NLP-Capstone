I hope this clip provides information that will save lives in the future.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Station_nightclub_fireThe Station nightclub fire was the fourth deadliest nightclub fire in American history, killing 100 people.

Another identical tragedy in Brazil last night... 230 people died. When are﻿ they going to ban fireworks in small venues?

What's craziest about watching this﻿ video is to realize just how FAST everything escalates. One minute you're having a blast, and literally the next minute flames are engulfing the room and everyone is in a mad panic.

It's unbelieveable how fast fire and smoke spread. Unfortunally, the lesson is still to be learned. ﻿

The cameraman makes it out at 7:35, and around 7:44 you can hear really frantic screams. Is that someone caught in the fire in the doorway? I didn't think﻿ the fire reached the entrance until much later?

At 10:56 as cameraman Butler is heading toward the stage door, he passes a guy w/his arms held out. In one of the forums on the fire, I found this person had apparently exited the building thru﻿ the stage door after crawling from the pileup at the front door! He recvd severe burns to his back, arms hands, and neck. Looking into that doorway I can't imagine how he could have done that!

For those interested in learning more about how all this happened and why, there is a book out now called "Killer Show" by John Barylick. Despite the sensationalistic title, it's a great expose on everything that happened, why it happened, how﻿ it happened, and who is to blame.

This comment has received too many negative votes

With many patrons at the beginning of the video showing the satanic hand sign aka horned hand, it was already a bad omen. In the spiritual realm, nighclubs are really the houses of the devil, where once every few years, he will require human sacrifices to be offered to appease him. The unwitting people who will carry out this scary deed are always the rockbands with their pyrotechnics. It is the same﻿ story all over again in US, Russia, Thailand & now Brazil & we won't be hearing the end of it.

 Your intentions are good, but they can't﻿ work in something like this. One of the 1st things they told me when I took swimming lessons 30 years ago was something like, "Anyone in a panic will hold on to you to escape. You have to be there, but not be drowned with them so when the rescuers get there; they only need to save one and not two". And it's not their fault either. Human nature makes you want to live.

He was charged for doing just that based on his own film! He stated in court that he had stopped to move a table aside. But I agree w/you that he should have gotten the hell out of the way. I don't see how he could have﻿ just stood there filming after exiting.

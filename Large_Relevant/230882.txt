Dear Glenn Beck, Please Don’t Call Yourself A ‘Libertarian’
by Andrew Kirell | 4:02 pm, January 9th, 2013
Open Letter

» 237 comments




 
















  

On Tuesday afternoon, it was announced that Glenn Beck plans to relaunch The Blaze as a “global libertarian news network” because he now identifies himself as a libertarian like Penn Jillette and wants to appeal to liberty-lovers who are disenchanted with the GOP and particularly partisan news outlets.
In keeping with the last time I addressed Beck’s so-called “libertarianism,” below is yet another open letter to the conservative commentator.
– –
Dear Mr. Beck:
Congratulations on your slow move towards libertarianism. We are glad for your newfound support for legal marijuana, gay marriage, and your backing down from Bush-era hawkishness. 
But many of us libertarians prefer to say “thanks but no thanks” to your attempt to become the “libertarian” leader of a so-called “global news network.”
As I’ve written before, you make it really hard for people who believe in limited government to be taken seriously. In the past, you’ve only given the media more reason to dismiss a largely intellectual movement as being just a bunch of tinfoil hat-wearing, overly aggressive crazy people.
You’re free to call yourself whatever you want. But that doesn’t mean we should accept you. While we agree with you on some of the big picture — government spends way too much money it doesn’t have, and is far too intrusive into our daily lives — many of us dislike your rhetoric and your chalkboard-and-puppets conspiracy version of history.
Look, we libertarians try to operate as a big tent. And I’m happy when non-libertarians like yourself aspire and draw towards it. The Atlantic‘s Jeffrey Goldberg recently pondered whether he is a libertarian, and that’s a welcome step forward for the movement. But when you or (the far, far worse) Alex Jones label yourselves “libertarian,” it is most certainly not a progression for us who already feel marginalized by the political process and much of the media.
Here’s just one example of how you take any semblance of a potentially rational discussion and elevate it to cuckoo land:
In the trailer for your new “libertarian” news network, you tease newsmagazine specials on topics that supposedly matter to liberty-minded folk, like some evil United Nations plot to disarm Americans. Do libertarians believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms? Yes. Do we generally oppose restrictive gun control? Absolutely. But do we think the federal government is in a cahoots with the U.N. to take away all of our guns? Uhhhh, no. That’s not “libertarian,” that’s fear-mongering with a naked appeal to the large portion of your viewers who already buy into the doomsday survivalist shtick available in your web store. 
Sure, some of your more ardent fans will back you up on your self-labeled “libertarianism,” but I challenge you to walk down the halls of Reason magazine and not have them snicker at your bizarro connect-the-dots version of history; or speak before 1,200+ college students at the annual Students for Liberty conference and not be booed or laughed off the stage when you lament the downfall of Western civilization at the hands of pro-gay shows like Glee; or submit an article to the Rothbardian types at LewRockwell.com and not have them pick apart every hysterical myth contained within. 
Now, of course, you may say we sound like the cool kids at the lunch table telling the weird kid that he can’t sit with us. But this isn’t the school cafeteria; this is a battle of ideas. And we are currently losing it because of people like you who have helped give limited government types a bad name. Rush Limbaugh makes conservatives look bad on a regular basis; and you assumedly want to be the libertarian version of that? No thanks.
Maybe you are, as you say, a “growing” libertarian — i.e., you’re “evolving,” coincidentally, like the president you dislike so much — but that doesn’t erase the years you’ve spent as a so-called “liberty lover” while almost never criticizing George W. Bush when he was in power. (Believe me. I know that because, in my previous career, it took days to find a single anti-GOP soundbite for a TV special on your fledgling career.) 
You’ve built a reputation as yet another right-wing firebrand who absolutely detests President Obama and will link anything and everything to his kneeling nightly before a Karl Marx statuette. It’s not the kind of baggage to carry around when dealing with libertarians who pride themselves on equal-opportunity skepticism of partisans on both sides who suffer from “President From The Other Party Derangement Syndrome.”
BuzzFeed writes that your relaunch as “libertarian” is an attempt to grab the eyeballs of the young people who are disgusted by the two parties and by the “shouting heads” on cable news. If so, I’m not sure you’ll be able to court them.
“If we’re Glenn Beck’s target audience, he’s missed his mark by a mile,” Daniel Bier told me this morning. He runs a prominent blog called The Skeptical Libertarian, which has a readership largely made up of libertarian students and professionals.
During the GOP primaries, most young libertarians rolled their eyes but had their preferred candidates who at least nodded in the direction of libertarianism. That included a bit of Jon Huntsman, a whole lot of Gary Johnson, and an even greater amount of Ron Paul. But were you out there supporting any of these guys while lamenting the big-government-conservative GOP field? No. You supported Michelle Bachmann at first, and then… Rick Santorum, arguably the most anti-libertarian GOP candidate since Pat Buchanan.
And, indeed, young liberty types find the Republican Party and Fox’s treatment of the news to be distasteful but, given that, do you really think that they will then turn to Glenn Beck, the man who has said things like this… or this?
Hopefully someday you can drop the histrionics and the looseness with facts, and then maybe we can all sing “Kumbaya” together under a libertarian tent.
But, in the meantime, I do wish you the best of luck. And since it’s part of my job, I will be watching. 
Sincerely,
Andrew Kirell

Andrew:
It’s awesome that you don’t like people calling themselves libertarians if you find them to be over the top.  I’d say that you don’t want people painting libertarians with a broad brush.  Yet, you do this everyday with Christians by scouring the internet to find some random Christian dude who said something stupid.  Of course, you’re prolly just fishing for comments by throwing stink bait out to your legion of far-left fans.

I should think that given Andrew Kirell is supposed to be a media professional, he would know as well as any reader commenter here that there’s no point making an intellectualized appeal to a social virus. 
And would also know that Beck gives approximately the same care for the health and future of libertarianism and Attila the Hun did for those of the peasant farmers in the path of his armies. I’m quite sure Beck regards libertarians as self-deluding rubes just begging for their wallets to be stolen and their movement reduced to stubble so miserable sheep wouldn’t touch it.
You won’t mind if I and the rest of the non-Rube and non-libertarian crowd leave for a while to cook up a mess of popcorn, will you Andrew? Sorry we’re not more sympathetic, but it’s really not our problem.






Anonymous



Libertarians = embarrassed Republicans
And they are only Libertarians when it comes to laws they don’t agree with. You don’t see Beck or others arguing for decriminalization of drugs, legalizing same sex marriage, or criticizing the military industrial complex that perpetuates a national security state, as most traditional libertarians espoused before Ron Paul perverted the term.

Meh, I’d say there are plenty of consistent libertarians out there, Andrew being one of them.  The problem they face is that too many conservative partisans are calling themselves libertarians in an effort to cover up for their stances on social issues, which are becoming ever more unpopular.  I’m sure there are plenty on the left who try to slip under that label as well, however I don’t think in the same numbers as we’re now seeing from lifelong Republican voters, since their candidates got thumped in 2012.

He’s definitely reaching in an effort to stay relevant (and paid).  It remains to be seen whether this is evidence that Glenn Back has a shame bone, or if he is just a shameless shapeshifter building a Trojan horse.

“he would know as well as any reader commenter here that there’s no point making an intellectualized appeal to a social virus.”
Sure, but you’d have to admit that Beck’s rebrand is an easy and fun target to take down, particularly for someone who has espoused libertarianism long before it became quasi-mainstream.
While I’m with you that these viral trolls don’t need any more attention, the fact that Glenn Beck may/may not be pretending to “evolve” is going to be entertaining because my guess is, he is doing this very begrudgingly and out of frustration, behind the scenes.  I can’t wait until the mask drops.

I like how Andrew Kirell tries to deny Glenn beck the position of “Libertarian spokesperson” by appointing himself as a libertarian spokesperson. Besides everyone knows that libertarians are free to make their own decisions about who they want to hear their news from.
Nah just kidding, they all get their news from Ron Paul.

Why would he even want to consider himself a libertarian? I find that most libertarians hate conservatives as much as or usually more than they hate those on the left, Kirell being a prime example. Personally, I don’t have anything wrong with the libertarian ideology (except when it wins elections for democrats), I just don’t agree with all of it.

“Rush Limbaugh makes conservatives look bad on a regular basis”. Really? Maybe to liberals and other heads full of indeterminate mush. Not to conservatives. True American libertarians believe in small government EXCEPT when it comes to our national defense-whatever it takes to keep us free and leading the free.They believe classic liberals,not libertines.In the higher power,not self-worship. In sanctity of life and property. In our sovereignty,which is always being undermined by attempts to make us subject to progressive transnational agencies. Glenn Beck is not crazy any more than Benjamin Franklin was.

Supporting a quixotic libertarian nominee in the US presidential election means handing easy victory to the bigger of two evils. Unfortunate,but true.Until there is more conservatives voting than liberals plus libertarians,smart people will vote Republican and not divide their votes to help the enemy of reasonable.

Mr. Beck be honest and stop insulting real libertarians by claiming to be one. Can’t you tell people you are a conservative and discredit them, at least for equal time requirements.

I believe that Beck is an absolute master of propaganda and I have silently laughed at all who believed every word he said as he described how everybody but him was using propaganda. That was as brilliant as any magician’s act. The difference is that when people watch a magician, they know they are being fooled and they like it.
I further believe that Beck had to make a switch from being rabidly conservative and constantly predicting that disaster was coming  in the very near future.  The very near future has a nasty trick of becoming the very recent past, and that can be embarrassing to a disaster prognosticator. Beck couldn’t make any more swing-and-a-miss mistakes, so he had to change to a milder attitude and a more inclusive one.
Beck, the master of propaganda, sees that Libertarian is the new “in thing” in political naiveté, and he is going for it.

False.  You’re confusing libertarianism with conservatism.  Libertarians are extremely skeptical of large military spending and a global military presence.

If you had half a clue about what is going down you would have known the conservative nut job group was imploding back in march of ’12. The libertarians backing Ron Paul were there to break the knees of the R party as much as they were there to support Paul, and most had to hold their noses to infiltrate and use the R’s. (There was much that didn’t make the news from lawsuits and missing truckloads of ballots to delegate lockouts and actual broken bones. The chairs in several states have resigned or been replaced since the primary.)
Now with the massive loss which slapped the R’s into semi-reality, caused by the libs. that refused to vote for Romney after the primary hoopla, the R’s are now scrambling in an vain attempt to grab a base that [like basic logic and science] they don’t understand.

Third party. Most Libertarians are disenfranchised Republicans. Heck, one of your guys ran for President last year as one.
And I have a tip for you. If you really want to see what America would look like if you guys won, a real “freedom” loving place with little to no Federal Government telling you what to do then head over to Yemen. It’s a Libertarians dream.
Pro tip….hire at least 30-50 bodyguards at the airport.

Actually no. Beck has never been a lib and in fact there are rules that will exclude you from being a libertarian. Libertarianism is not an anything goes pile of chaos, there are actually very specific philosophical ingredients in a libertarian pie.

I think its good that penn inspired beck bc penn is a very smart man but reading this article felt like someone had been reading my thoughts. It is nice to know like_minded libertarians are out there bc to be honest when I turn on network news it makes me feel like there is no hope. Imho libertarianism is the inevitable final stage in an individuals political evolution given they have an open mind and are willing to learn. What distresses me is that beck skipped an important stage in this evolutionary procecess-liberalism. Without liberal tolerance one would never be able to bare allowing individuals to make choices for themselves that have been deemed unacceptable by social conservatives (drug use, freedom of sexual expression, freedom of religion, etc)  without reprocussions from the state. I implore the open minded liberals to research the root causes of corruption at the federal level. Ask yourselves why every politician in the fed seems to be so untrustworthy and duplicitous. I don’t want to sound so holier than thou but I do honestly feel liberals are close to libertarians and the only difference is liberals don’t understand the root causes of corruption. My liberal friends say the corruption is caqused by money but then I ask them why money has been able to corrupt the system they look at me cfross eyed. Fact is wherever there is power over others there will inevitably be corruption. Money is a symptom not the root cause. Ill leave you with thbis…everyone is a libertarian without realizing it. Nobodyh can tell you when to get out of bed, what to wear, when to eat, whether to go to work, whether to ingest mind altering substances, etc. The only thing they can do is punish you. In the end you are always the one caling the shots. Libertarians have just decided that we trust ourselves not to give power to a self imposed behavior modifier in the government bc we already have one- OURSELVES! Empowering ain’t it? Sorry for the ypos. Using my mobile phone which sucks and its not even worth it to go back and correct. Good luck friends!

The more post of yours I read the more I realize your just another poorly educated neo-con that has no understanding of what a libertarian is or why they take the positions they do on various issues.
I’ve been running libertarian for 2 decades and associate regularly with all the variety and levels, from centrists to full anarchists, from half assed conservative”libertarians” (including going to Republican conventions) to freelove hippy libertines and pro gun Dems.. All attempt to abide by the one criteria needed to be libertarian, however you do not even seem to know what it is.






Dawn Blush



No true scotsman accusations are exactly why the Libertarian Party will forever remain a fringe group.
I consider myself a Libertarian but I don’t agree with every single aspect, mainly FP. I am also a member of the Republican Party. My neighbor is a CATO fellow and is also a member of the Republican Party even though he is a die-hard Libertarian.
Stop trying to put everyone in boxes. Many Libertarians are Republicans and tea-party activists. We don’t have to agree 100% on everything and if that’s what some Libertarians keep insisting on then it only makes it harder on the rest of us actually working within the party to make an actual difference.
Beck is a free person and can call himself whatever he wishes and he can also disagree on some LIbertarian aspects.
Good grief.






    http://twitter.com/WolfeGarrett                            Garrett Wolfe



I believe you are confusing ideology with philosophy. Ideology is what you want in a world built for you(the ideal). Philosophy is a logical search for truth which is what the core of libertarianism is based on.
(The hardened core spend many hours analyzing and subtly tweaking that which is libertarian for logical consistency. Something I have never come across in any significant way among liberals and conservatives, who seem more concerned with ramming their arbitrary emotion based ideology down the other groups throat.)
And yes, we do despise conservatives and liberals equally.






Dawn Blush



Huh? The “godfather” of the tea party is Ron Paul a LIBERTARIAN.






Dawn Blush



Actually YOU are the one that’s mistaken. FP is actually the only position in which many Libertarians, myself included, will not agree with.
People like Andrew, feel they are self-appointed ex-communicators of what is or isn’t a Libertarian which is why they remain a small fringe group.






Dawn Blush



Good grief. Republican is the name of a party, within the party resides many different ideologies. “Conservatism” itself has many aspects, social, fiscal, neo and moderate. They aren’t the same and additionally many Libertarians are members of the Republican and/or Tea Party.






    http://www.facebook.com/btunheim                            Brian Tunheim



Does Liberty in libertarian support the redefinition of words? As in marriage? Then it is built on a lie.






Dawn Blush



“But that doesn’t mean we should accept you.”
Who is “we”? Seriously. Do you not see how crazy this sounds? Is there a form I have to fill out to be approved by “we” else be denied membership or ex-communicated.
THIS is what makes your above statement hilarious:
“we libertarians try to operate as a big tent”
Uhhhhh, no you don’t which is the entire premise of your article. No one is allowed to dare be a Libertarian if they don’t agree with YOU or apparently “we” on every aspect of what YOU have decided is a Libertarian. 
No true Scotsman = failure.

There’s a difference between being “angry” and being “fed up.” Beck did all he could to help wake Americans to truth, but too many Americans have been put in the position of voting themselves handouts and not even Beck could get those people to “ask what YOU can do for your country.” He’s exhausted and deserves a rest from talking about and listening to “HWSRN.”

You said, “Libertarians are extremely skeptical of large military spending and a global military presence”, when that’s not true, there is a huge disagreement in the Libertarian community on FP.

No, I meant ideology. 5,703 people voted for  Libertarian Jim L. Vein. If those same people (or even  2,647 of them) voted for Mia Love (who called Bastiat a “stud”), she would have been elected. That is an ideology, not a philosophy.

“FP is actually the only position in which many Libertarians, myself included, will not agree with.”
Foreign policy is a big deal, and not just some lone, singular position that can be minimized, especially when you factor in how big of a percentage military spending is in our budget/GDP.  The Tea Party is largely funded by the Koch Brothers, who identify with the libertarian views on fiscal conservatism through limited government.  The inconsistencies come when many of their candidates discuss not only their interventionist foreign policy views, but also their social stances, many of which (i.e. Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock, Allen West, etc) are directly at odds with the liberal social views that long time libertarians have.  The conservative brand has been damaged in recent years, and as a result we see people like Glenn Beck suddenly putting on the libertarian hat despite his disdain for the separation of church and state and fervent defend-Israel-at-all-costs loyalty.

You’re not a true libertarian, Kirell, if you don’t want all drugs decriminalized—yes opiates and cocaine too–and you want to continue the War on Women by making abortion the same as murder, which is what “libertarians” Ron Paul (and Son) want.
True libertarians do not wander into areas of ethics that do not have a unanimity of opinion–and even then where there is a unanimity, no law of government is ever necessary to affirm it.
As such, Beck is no more or less qualified to call himself a libertarian than any of the others who think they are but who clearly take stances contradictory to the principles of libertarianism.

First lie of this article: Glenn claims to be a libertarian like Penn Jillette. If you watched his show last night, clearly you would have heard him specifically say he’s a Libertarian, but not like Penn Jillette or even Ron Paul (meaning not as far down that road). However, one thing you should try to do is analyze the facts instead of bashing the messanger, who you clearly don’t know anything about.

Funny. My mother is an avid glenn beck fan, and I disagree. I’d say at best, Beck is a conservative who likes certain libertarian principles. His brand of pseudo libertarianism has more to do with the republican establishment than it does with Bastiat, Rothbard, etc. Personally I think this is because he doesnt understand what libertarianism actually is, and is trying to re-define it to what he wants it to be, to justify supporting Authoritarian candidates as he did in the election

Well if Glenn Beck is a libertarian and will head the direction of Penn Jillett or  Alex Jones then I am off the train. I am conservative, independent, free thinker and not 100% lock and step with the libertarian party. I have no  hard feeling against the libertarian movement, but I do not agree with it on fundamental issues including some social stances like drugs, foreign policy, and some of the rhetoric that people like Ron Paul and his followers have used against corporations and against border safety. I am sorry to say that thanks to legendary  status of Ron Paul he has hurt the libertarian cause because so many people think of him first.  He might have been in the Republican party but many conservatives have groaned about him and knew he used the Republican party to keep his seat warm in congress because libertarians do not win elections. So I am sorry to say he has hurt the libertarian cause because i know from reading up and studying that many in the libertarian party and with a libertarian mindset do not agree with Ron and Ron even has different stances on some issues than the platform. But, alas the Paulers, his followers, get in the way of everything. They have the loudest voice in the room even as a tiny minority. And they spoil the apple cart. And I want nothing to do with them because we don’t agree on so much. So If Glenn Beck is heading  down the libertarian direction and not a conservative one then I have to re asses if he is worth following.

Yup.

Fortunately, actual libertarians are neither confused nor amused by this latest bout of shape-shifting cowardice/opportunism, which is why the article was written in the first place.

While we’d probably disagree on most things politically, I admire your ability to critically assess a (formerly?) very popular conservative media figure, or at lease one who called himself conservative until he spotted another opportunity.  I was actually quite surprised to see the amount of conservative commenters who suddenly started calling themselves libertarians on this thread, seemingly just because Beck did.  Those kinds are either not intelligent enough to realize how shamelessly unprincipled that comes across, or not brave enough to admit they’d made a mistake in judgment (as we all are susceptible of doing with anyone, not just public figures).  I respect you for assessing him using your own principles, instead of just nodding your head in the face of a cowardly, opportunistic about-face.

Oh I liked Glenn since I first heard him in 2003. But he has a problem with trying to figure out his ideology and with associating with different kinds of people. He was right on so muich but I have heard him go from saying he is a independent and a Independent-conservative to being a libertarian. Everyday he changes it too. Everyday he tries a new twist. So he is now associating himself with people on both the conservative side and libertarian side. And while  we have some things in common, somethings we don’t. And conservatives are craving a more conservative outlet or channel not a libertarian one. I figured he was a conservative-libertarian hybrid for a few years. but in October he said on a show with a panel that he was conservative then Tuesday night he claims he is libertarian again. He needs to make up his mind and be 100% clear on where he stands and what he wants because he is starting to confuse, surprise and even anger some people. He, as this site reported, was agreeing with S.E. Cupp on gay marriage when he went on his networks show ‘Real News’, but he was actively supporting social conservatives Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann in the GOP primaries. So Glenn Is paying lip service to somebody because it is exactly jiving  and melding perfectly every position he takes.

As Casanova pointed out, Beck and his gang of yes-men (like yourself) either do not understand libertarianism, or are simply trying to redefine the movement in order to support the Authoritarian candidates that he endorses.  In the case of not understanding libertarianism, my guess is that would fall more on his gang of yes men.      Beck, on the other hand, is simply cherry picking the few libertarian tenets he likes in order to manipulate libertarianism into something that it is not.  Someone already made the point before, but what Beck is trying to do is no different then a person who wants to legalize weed while advocating a huge welfare state, and calling himself a libertarian.  It is not just some selective free for all of ideals, and that is what a lot of conservatives (and many liberals, to be fair) fail to understand.

Beck’s supposed switch from ultra-conservative to ultra-libertarian is a sure sign of the decline of conservatism in this country. It is not profitable for him anymore. This turn of events is partially his fault, but what matters is that he knows he has milked conservatism as much as he can and it is time to move on to the new trend, which he will proceed to milk dry and discredit in the process.

Conservatism is about dead, only hope conservatism has of going on in the future is to convert to libertarianism.  But much like the Republican Party, the libertarian movement has no respectable leadership.  Ron Paul was that guy but I believe his public life is over.  Gary Johnson never really took off like Ron Paul did.  I suppose Rand Paul is the greatest hope for a leader that the libertarian movement has.  Otherwise, it’s really Glenn Beck, Alex Jones, John Stossel, Judge Naplatano, Penn Jillette, and Andrew Kirell.  Much like the Republican Party at large, the leadership of the libertarian movement mainly consists of media personalities, not actual members of the government, in other words, no opportunity to lead, just talk. 
I respect the libertarian’s right to believe in their ideology, much as I respect anyone’s right to believe in any sort of ideology, I just think that libertarian America is more of a Jacksonian fantasy, something which cannot be achieved in a post WW2 America, but you guys are always fun for conversation & I agree with you 100% on social issues, but fiscally speaking, libertarians scare people, particularly women & the elderly.

I supported Huntsman and then ran from the rest of the republicans to Gary Johnson.

Where do you live?  I cannot imagine a more wasted, senseless vote than a person in California, NY, or Pennsylvania voting for Republicans in the absurd hope it will somehow rein in the size, scope, power or expense of government.  
For that matter, voting Republican in states like Texas or Alabama in the hope that doing so will reduce the size, scope, power or expense of government is silly as Rs win there by wide margins.  Then – when elected – like GW Bus h -go out and dramatically increase spending, double the national debt, and embroil America in multiple wars.
If you are so short-sighted as to believe that this year’s election is critical to the Liberty Movement, then you will continue to chase your tail and be disappointed year-after-year.  You will continue to waste your vote on people like McCain and Romney who – we now know with certainty – could not possibly win.
If you are sincere about building an America with a smaller, less expensive, less intrusive government, when exactly are you going to start voting for that?   Apparently, you are content to let others do the hard work of actually building a better America.  Apparently, you are going to leave that job to those who are working to elect quixotic libertarian nominees.

Andrew,
I agree with your assessment of Glenn Beck.  However, as a strongly libertarian leaning conservative, I disagree with you if you think that the Republican party is farther away from libertarian ideals than the Democrat party is.  If I am wrong in that assessment of you, I will stand corrected.
Right now, we are stuck with a two party system.  Only ONE of those parties even entertains the thought of reining in government spending.  And it ain’t the Democrats.  Yet, in this column (as in most of your columns) you only speak negatively of Republicans and conservatives.
Your complaint about Beck is spot on.  You need to look in the mirror also, though.






Elijah West



I applaud Beck’s desire to be libertarian, and it may move him more
towards that path in the years to come, but right now I think he has in
mind the pop-culture idea of what a libertarian is, not what it is in
reality. 
If you want a substantial and real taste of libertarianism, go visit Free Talk Live. Everything is free. You can contribute to their stories, and download all the podcasts of their show for absolutely free. That’s true libertarian intellectualism. And it shows you how free, peaceful and loving libertarians actually are.

I think the problem is that most social conservatives buy into the myth that since this a Christian nation (i.e. God’s ATF), that a free market will necessarily promote socially conservative values.  So if we get government and its pagan, Marxist agenda out of the way, every blockbuster film will be something family friendly, all kids in public schools will pray all the time, no one will do drugs, teens won’t have sex before marriage, etc.

It was Republicans like Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock who didn’t think rape victims who got pregnant should be allowed to have an abortion, which would literally give rapists legal power over their female victims.  Sorry Clark, but trying to revamp the healthcare system is not invading your body, and the government has always had laws involving health care, so stop being so naive.

That’s a smear job, not the truth. The truth is that they are individuals who want limited government, and mean it. The marijuana legalization thing is just one minor aspect of a far bigger overall view on government.
“Suck up to the rich” is a strawman. The reality is that rich folk are the most persecuted minority in America today, and Libertarians are those who simply advocate treating them like normal people. Of course, if you treat rich folk like normal people, the Left claim that you’re “sucking up to the rich”, even though that isn’t actually your motivation. It’s just yet another smear job in a whole plethora of Left wing smear jobs.

Mr.Kirell,
Please help me understand why you are a Libertarian in the shortest way possible.
I know it is a complex subject, but I already see that some are Libertarian because they believe all governments are corrupt to the point of being massive conspiracies of subjugation, which is a Marxist idea, while others are Libertarian just because they oppose the “religious mythology” that social conservatives adhere to (also Marxist). Others concentrate on the negatives of things like “fiat money” (hint: money always has been “fiat” in that governments issue notes and coins with a face value that in no way reflects the value of the paper or metal it is made of.)
The one thing that I think a Libertarian is supposed to believe is that man is basically a social animal and each man wants to live in a cooperative society. The simplest and most credible Libertarian belief is that big government is inefficient, but not necessarily evil.

They’re persecuted for a whole host of reasons. I can list some of the catchphrases: Rich, Wealthy, Greedy, Selfish, Exploiter, Ruthless, 1%, Profiteering, Price Gouging, Wage Slavery, Polluter, Unfair, etc.
They are vilified at every opportunity, and then persecuted by governments in the form of confiscatory tax rates, oppressive regulations, and in the worst cases, outright nationalization of their property.
The Left have smeared “the rich” as being the ultimate evil. No matter what rich folk want to do – Build a factory, expand a business, mine some resources, etc – They instantly face persecution from an army of useful idiots who have been fooled into accepting the idea that ALL rich people are pure evil that must be opposed, and then face political oppression from politicians who hate Capitalism, who hate the Free Market, and who hate Property Rights. It is so disgusting a view of “the rich”, that I have no other choice but to declare that they are incredibly persecuted.

Look at the historical source of the “anti-rich” propaganda. It’s the same crap happening all over again, and you’re just one more “useful idiot” for their cause. Y’know, I’m probably poorer than most people here, but I will never accept the idea that “rich people” ought to have their wealth redistributed to me, and/or that “rich people” are the reason I am poor.

In England there is a milliner who makes Lady Gaga type hats whose millinery is named the Libertarian http://www.thelibertarian.co.uk/.  There is also a property management company in London called the Libertarian http://www.libertarian.uk.com/us.html.  As it grows in popularity more people, not just Bill Maher and Glenn Beck, are going to use the word.

Andrew, it seems inconsistent for you to embrace the controversial Ron Paul while shunning Glenn Beck.
Glenn has some extremist views out of the mainstream to be sure. But is he any worse than Mr. Paul and his newsletters comments about blacks, Jews and gays that has created so much controversy?
Lest we forget, Mr. Paul did cast two thirds of all the lone negative votes in the House during a 1995–1997 period. I submit he is far more how of the mainstream than Mr. Beck — and that’s pretty far indeed.
I just don’t understand how you can give a man who opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 a full-throated endorsement while questioning Glenn Beck’s desire to join the movement.

You can disagree with the messenger. I wish that a lot of liberal messengers weren’t the voice for modern American liberalism.
But what is the honest difference between what you and Beck BELIEVE? You can disagree on methods or means of expression. But your ideas are identical. How are you honestly any different?

How do you know if you might be a libertarian?  
Do you tell other people what it does and doesn’t take to
become a libertarian? Most likely that means you are not a libertarian.
The more you agree with one particular candidate (i.e. Ron
Paul) the less you think for yourself.  
Is Glenn Beck a libertarian?
Who gives a  sh*t!  Move on.
Libertarians are usually more cerebral than others when it comes to
discussing the issues.  Stick to this
formula.  And yes Andrew, it does sound
like the rantings of a bully who questions his own understanding of libertarian
ideology.  It’s advised to question the
truth of any individual, and it shows you have done research to support that,
but to brandish an entrance exam to determine the authenticity of a movement
designed to be quite simple is just tacky and just plain childish.  The joy of libertarianism is that there is no
“gatekeeper”.
Does Reason speak for all libertarians? No.
Does Alex Jones speak for all libertarians? No.
Does Ron Paul speak for all libertarians? No.
Does Glen Beck speak for all libertarians? No.
Do you, Andrew, speak for all libertarians? No.






Guess Again



If Glenn Beck were a libertarian (which he is definitely NOT), this would be a great idea. However, Mr. Beck is a NeoconMan RINO. His throwing of patriot statesman, Dr. Ron Paul, under the bus (remember him saying “Ron Paul is wildly dangerous”?) is evidence enough of that claim. Endorsing Rick Santorum, (a George W. Bush clone who had ZERO chance of winning the GOP nomination) as a way of diverting support away from Congressman Paul in an effort to get Romney the nomination is typical of the way Beck operates. This guy is as slimy as they come. Liberty will NEVER exist where Glenn Beck is involved…and I’m a Mormon.






Guess Again



Glenn Beck believes in Liberty about as much as Obama, Bush, Clinton and Nixon (all treasonous degenerates). The ONLY reason Beck is doing this is because he is going broke. He said as much last month. GBTV has tanked. Now he is actually giving the show away for free on Dish Network in the hopes of attracting more subscribers. Beck had to vacate NYC because he was being publicly humiliated wherever he went. Now that he is in DFW, the same thing is happening. That’s why he is talking about creating his own walled libertarian city. Mr. Beck can’t understand why Ron Paul supporters are so angry with him that they tell him to his face that he is a scumbag when he is out with his family. The reason is because Dr. Paul’s supporters aren’t using liberty as a way to make $$ (as Beck does). They believe in Liberty with all their collective might. Beck has repeatedly said that he is nothing more than a “rodeo clown”. For once, I agree with him. It also has become VERY obvious that Beck is stealing content from Alex Jones, who is without question, a libertarian.






Guess Again



They are lying. Libertarians believe in live and let live. We believe in minding our manners and our own business. I see NO difference between the Democrats and the Republicans other than the bull excrement that so freely flows from their mouths. You either believe in freedom (as a Libertarian does) or you don’t (as the Dems and Repubs don’t). It’s really that easy to understand.






Guess Again



Nonsense. Hemp oil, natural gas and coal can power our entire nation. Nice spin though.






Guess Again



Marry who you want. Smoke what you want. Government has ZERO business telling you who to associate with. Unless you are harming another person, libertarians couldn’t care less what you are doing.






Guess Again



Libertarians believe prostitution should be decriminalized. Didn’t you get the memo?






Guess Again



A woman’s right to choose=murder. So, yes, we believe that all humans have the right to remain unharmed by other humans. LIFE, LIBERTY, the PURSUIT of HAPPINESS=LIBERTARIAN

    http://twitter.com/ilovegrover                            Thane_Eichenauer



I believe Glenn Beck has slowly but certainly become more libertarian over time. Back in 2008 (five years ago) he was certainly not a libertarian but I would say by 2010 that an average American might call him one.  Since 2010 he has certainly been at least a borderline libertarian even by my definition.  He certainly has a sympathy for Republicans such as Mitt Romney but perhaps it takes more than 2 years to cure yourself from that particular affliction.






    http://twitter.com/ilovegrover                            Thane_Eichenauer



Have you listened to Glenn Beck or visited his news website in the last year?  What has he said that makes you think that he doesn’t support freedom?  Did Glenn Beck throw a rock through your window?

Of all Glenn Beck has said and all Glenn Beck has done that is all you can say of his effort?  I don’t disagree with everything in this article but I still find your comment to be disappointingly simplistic.

Of the 2,647 needed to prevail it is possible that most of the people that voted Libertarian were waiting for a candidate that publicly supported equal marriage rights for gay people and legalization of marijuana.

I would say that Glenn Beck was much less systematically pro-freedom four years ago.  Two years ago he was pretty pro-freedom on 80%+ of issues.  I have hope that he will only get better but I have to say that hearing a number of 2012 clips about him saying that many people are praying for Mitt Romney in the election run up gives even me pause for concern.

“provides a good product” 
How do you define good? McDonalds sells a lot of burgers but it’s called junk food for a reason. Beck panders to people’s fears and prejudice while abandoning honesty and rational thought. {and encouraging his listeners to do likewise} This is America, where you can get rich selling crap to the masses.

No advocate of limited government promises utopia.  However I will point out that government mandated racism hurts race relations more than racism does in this day and age.  As for the EPA much if not all of the problem of water and air pollution is related to government permitted pollution and de facto government ownership of water.  That which is privately owned is carefully preserved, that which is government owned few care enough about to carefully protect.

Also,
“decades’ worth of obsession with conspiracies, sympathy for the right-wing militia movement, and deeply held bigotry against blacks, Jews and gays. In short, they suggest that Ron Paul is not the plain speaking antiwar activist his supporters believe they are backing—-but rather a member in good standing of some of the oldest and ugliest traditions in American politics.”

I can say that I find 19 year old newsletters to be the end all be all of what Ron Paul believes in but I thank you for bringing it up.  Do you think Ron Paul still believes in the exact ideas found in the Newsletters today?  It seems to me that he certainly doesn’t endorse those writings.

If you seriously think GB offers a good product I doubt what I say will matter. IMO it’s incredibly obvious to any person who examines his nonsense with a little critical thought. I’ve paid very littler attention to him since he left Fox network but the blurbs I’ve seen don’t indicate any meaningful change. He was famous {or infamous} for his chaulkboard conspiricy theories which were a ridiculous mess of inaccuarate selective facts and twisted logic. It’s not hard to find a picture of him holding up a picture of a swastika and a hammer and sickle. He made a huge show of his religious gathering in DC bringing a variety of ministers and calling for religious unity, and the very next day began attacking the president with a dishonest representation of Black Liberation Theology. The guy is a snake oil salesman.

C’mon Thane, Googling isn’t the hardest thing to do, this is old territory, covered extensively in the primary, but here’s just a tiny tiny taste. You can find much more.
http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&ved=0CDoQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Farticles.washingtonpost.com%2F2012-01-27%2Fpolitics%2F35438143_1_controversial-newsletters-ron-paul-survival-report-jesse-benton&ei=z07zUPmpPISLrAGUi4C4DQ&usg=AFQjCNFNGMKIpY-ObOQShvPrJq3iBBD0rA&bvm=bv.1357700187,d.aWM

Googling isn’t hard but it offers 10 answer for every question and I can’t hope to disprove 10 articles that you may or may not agree with.  Your link to the Washington Post is a fixed article with fixed words (we hope) that I can either agree or disagree with and that I can take issue with and make some points in favor of or in disagreement with.
As far as the Ron Paul Newsletters are concerned they are certainly a black mark on his record but I don’t think that his actions outside of the Newsletters are indicative of a person that is biased on race, religion or sexual preference when it comes to the use and application of the law.
In any case I thank you for providing a fixed link.

“That which is privately owned is carefully preserved, that which is government owned few care enough about to carefully protect.”  So did you manage to keep a straight face while saying this, ignoring the reality completely, or have you never seen a “company yard” at any major manufacturing facility that’s more than 20 years old?  Companies pollute their own land all the damn time, and many times it’s only once a “government agency” finds out that they’re mandated to clean it up.  Do I really need to cite instances of this?






    http://twitter.com/ilovegrover                            Thane_Eichenauer



If we use the first 10 sites at this this Public Integrity post as a baseline and judging just from the names of the properties I would say that 5 of the 10 appear to be government owned or operated properties and 5 of of the 10 appear to be private properties.  I would call that roughly a draw.  I would however say that since government can and does exempt itself from its own pollution rules and that rarely can outside influences force a government to obey its own rules that government is still a larger hazard.
In any case I thank you for making a rather good point.

The GOP lost the election for two reasons.  They snubbed Ron Paul and purposely suppressed his true count of votes.  Secondly, Glenn Beck, who said he only 50% agreed with Ron Paul (mostly having foreign policy issues with him) wound up fully supporting Romney, a Morman, like himself.  Nothing against Mormans, except when it comes to voting for one in a crony manner instead of on the principled, constitutional values that he built his audience on.  He should have put full support behind Ron Paul, the father of the principles that Beck built his empire on, but he didn’t.  Because of the GOP’s snubbing of Paul, and Beck as well, the GOP lost.  Ron Paul could have, and should have been the GOP candidate, and as such, I believe he could have won the election.  Personally, I knew no one on the right of center who truly wanted Romney as the GOP candidate.  Now, after the damage is done, Beck, who now “imagineers” himself as some Disney media mogul, is jumping on the libertarian bandwagon, without even so much as mentioning Ron Paul.  Fox News, as an aside is now miming all that Beck inititally fleshed out, months if not years ago, with frequent mentions of Alinsky and Soros and socialist agenas, etc., whereas when Beck was on Fox, they thought he was the devil incarnate and wouldn’t even come close to miming his content. It’s the same with Paul.  Fox won’t so much as mention the names of Beck or Paul, when they’re now on both of their bandwagons, at differing levels.  I listen to both, mostly Beck, because Beck, regardless of his mistakes, has been right, more times 
than Fox, and because there’s a fuller picture available by listening to the conventional side (Fox) and the more ballsy side (Beck).

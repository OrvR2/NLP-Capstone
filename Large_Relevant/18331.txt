im a united fan an to be honest i think hes one of the best strikers in the league at the moment he had a slow start to the season but over the last 2 months hes been unreal and he cant stop scoring at the moment if they buy someone like cavanni , villa and even someone like dzeko or tevez even to play alongside giroud and walcott arsenal have a great chance of winning the league next season thumbs up if u agree and like i said im a united fan but id love to see arsenal wint he league next year

CAIRO (AP) — Egyptian security officials say 22 people have been killed in riots sparked by death sentences given to nearly two dozen soccer fans convicted of violence after a game in Port Said last year.
The security officials say most were killed in assaults on the governor's office, courthouse and prison after the sentence was handed down during a trial outside Cairo. They say two policemen also were shot to death outside the city's main prison when angry relatives tried to storm the facility.
The military has been deployed to try and restore security.
The judge sentenced 21 people to death in connection with the Feb. 1, 2012, soccer melee that killed 74 fans of the Cairo-based Al-Ahly team.
The security officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

Let's see... the protesters kill people to protest the guilty verdict for people who killed people. 

Muslims, what a wacky bunch.

When was the last time we got news out of the middle east that didn't involve violence or the threat of violence?

If we could get rid of the Middle East, North Korea, and soccer, the world would be such a peaceful place.

A deadly riot over a deadly riot?  Only in the Middle East.  Well, maybe Africa.  And occasionally South America.  Okay, and parts of Europe.  That's it, though.  And Central America.  Okay, that's REALLY it.

How can a sport that is so dull cause so much violence all over the world.  In Central America it even started a war.  Keep your violence on the field!

and ppl wonder why egypt is not an ideal tourist destination these days. i mean if they get so obsessed over a soccer game, no wonder few foreigners want to visit at the the expense of their lives.

5daysagoPolice: Brazil nightclub fire kills at least 233A fire broke out early Sunday morning at a night club in Santa Maria, in southern Brazil, killing revelers — many of them students. NBC's Mike Taibbi reports. By Jeff Black, Staff Writer, NBC NewsUpdated at 1:23 a.m. ET: At least 233 people were killed after a band’s fireworks show sparked a rapidly moving fire in a packed nightclub in southern Brazil and fleeing patrons were unable to find their way out, local police said.Follow @NBCNewsWorld
 The bodies removed from the Kiss nightclub in the southern city of Santa Maria were taken to the Municipal Sports Center gymnasium for identification, police said.Major Gerson da Rosa Ferreira, who led rescue efforts at the scene for the military police, told Reuters that the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled. Police Maj. Cleberson Braida Bastianello told the Associated Press by telephone that the toll had risen to 233 with the death of a hospitalized victim.

Officials earlier counted 232 bodies that had been brought to the gymnasium in Santa Maria.In addition to the number of deaths, more  than 100 people were injured, police said, and most remain hospitalized. Police officials had reported earlier in the day that 245 people were  killed. The  death toll could still rise, police said later, from the  people who are  injured.Fire brigade colonel Guido Pedroso de Melo told O Globo newspaper that rescuers had difficulty entering the premises because of "a barrier of bodies" at  the entrance to the club.Television footage monitored by Reuters overnight showed people crying outside the club as shirtless firefighters used sledge hammers and axes to knock down an exterior wall to open up an exit. Agencia RBS via APPeople help a man injured in a nightclub fire in Santa Maria city, Brazil, on Sunday.Rodrigo Moura, who the newspaper Diario de Santa Maria identified as a security guard at the club, said it was at its capacity of between 1,000 and 2,000 people and patrons were pushing and shoving to escape, the AP reported. Police estimated the crowd at some 900 revelers.Fire officials said at least one exit was locked and that club bouncers, who at  first thought those fleeing were trying to skip out on bar tabs, initially  blocked patrons from leaving, Reuters reported.The club's management said in a statement it would help authorities with their investigation, Reuters reported.One of the club's owners has surrendered to police for questioning, GloboNews TV reported. "It was really fast. There was a lot of smoke, really dark smoke," survivor Aline Santos Silva, 29, told Globonews TV. "We were only able to get out quickly because we were in a VIP area close to the door." President Dilma Rousseff cut short a visit to Chile and visited families of the victims at the Municipal Sports Center, where relatives were gathering to identify the bodies. She met with relatives of the injured at Hospital de Caridade de Santa Maria.Rousseff declared a national three-day mourning period for victims of the fire. “Sad Sunday!” Tarso Genro, the governor of Rio Grande do Sul state where the club is located, tweeted. “We are taking all of the possible and appropriate actions,” the tweet read, according to a rough translation by NBC News. “I will be in Santa Maria later this morning.”The precise cause of the fire was still under investigation, authorities said. But Luiza Sousa, a civil police official in Santa Maria, told Reuters that the blaze started when someone with the band ignited what was described as a flare, which then set fire to the ceiling. The fire spread "in seconds," Sousa said. The tragedy in Brazil recalled other nightclub disaster. A fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in 2003 killed 100 people after pyrotechnics used on stage by the rock band Great White set ablaze foam used for soundproofing on the walls. A Buenos Aires nightclub blaze in 2004 killed nearly 200 people. Reuters noted that Brazil's safety standards and emergency response capabilities are under particular scrutiny as the country prepares to host the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Brazilian state’s Health secretary, Ciro Simoni, told the news service that emergency medical supplies from all over the state were being sent to the scene. Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore related topics: brazil, fire, nightclub, featured

Koatz1,000 people inside?  That wasn't a club, it was a concert hall. 
1 vote#171 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:21 PM ESTstevephoenix-4019717My bet is that this club facility did not have an automatic fire sprinkler system installed and in operating condition. If that had been present, there would be no such headline. Automatic sprinkler protection has a remarkable life safety record, not only in homes, but also in places of public assembly, shopping centers and a host of industrial and commercial facilities.1 vote#172 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:23 PM ESTstevephoenix-4019717They should ban these "assault fires".1 vote#173 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:24 PM ESTLinda,  New York CityThere is blame to go aournd.  It's not just the officials, it's also the owners of these clubs that allow the fireworks, etc.  Let's not forget the bands that use them and fail to provide safe guards.#174 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:25 PM ESTstevephoenix-4019717Wow! 245 people killed and not a shot fired. It can't be!2 votes#175 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:25 PM ESTChii2Ban third world countries...yes even Brazil is considered to be Third World. 1 vote#176 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:27 PM ESTpeter1589-2514158A rock 'n roll establishment gets torched?  Quelle surprise?  Didn't Jesus say:
13:4. Or those eighteen upon whom the tower fell in Siloe and slew them: think you that they also were debtors above all the men that dwelt in Jerusalem?
13:5. No, I say to you: but except you do penance, you shall all likewise perish.
As difficult or impossible as it is for you worldlings to accept, rock 'n roll is a satanic mockery of the Catholic Church.  Peter was the Rock upon whom Christ the Rock built his sole, unique Church.  A "roll" is a piece of bread, satan's mockery of the Eucharist, without which there is no salvation.
And satanic fire killed these people?  Gee, what did St. John Vianney say about taverns?
"Was it not in those houses that dancers congregated and men forgot their duty?" He tackled this enemy from the outset, nor did a holy indignation allow him to mince his words. He made his own the phraseology of St. John Climacus, in order to strike the harder: "The tavern," he exclaimed, "is the devil's own shop, the school where hell retails its dogmas, the market where souls are bartered, the place where families are broken up, where health is undermined, where quarrels are started and murders committed." 
Stay out of the bars, the taverns, the hip-hop clubs, the lounges, and all the other satanic establishments.  The demons number in the billions and plot both your and my demise, seeking the right Moment.  Visit Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament and pray the Rosary.  Time is finite, as are our lives.  Where will you and I be when the Veil of Eternity is parted and our souls are judged for all time?
God love and bless you all.#177 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:29 PM ESTstevephoenix-4019717There are some things in life you just don't do. 
a) Move to Blue States if you can all possibly avoid it. b) Fly in Russian made commercial airliners. c) Fly on Taiwanese based airlines ( regardless of who makes the planes) d) Go to crowded night clubs in third world countries. 
All of the above increase your chances of danger and ruin enormously1 vote#178 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:31 PM ESTstevephoenix-4019717There can be little doubt that the club was in nearly as many violations of Brazilian law as it would be of comparable laws in most US cities. What will inevitably be coming to the US is Brazilian levels of corruption of government officials -- indeed that has already arrived in most large cities that are little more than one party microstates. There have been incidents like this in NYC in the past, and no doubt there will be more in US cities in the future.1 vote#179 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:36 PM ESTlee gotthardtObviously fireworks, clubs, and the rock music caused this, they all need to be banned!!!!!#180 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:38 PM ESTsamondDeletedyo yo dancerIronically, most of the people were killed by people (trampled), not by the fire itself.  We are our own worst enemy. #182 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:48 PM ESTEdson Lisboathis is a tradicional old place there!! It is a city that gather a lot of young univesity people there they had sure if not sprinters they had fire extinguishers but the acustic ceiling was all about foam the band musicians acted a risky pirotecnical show in a inaproprieated environment!! It was just the same as smoking near a gas pum in a gas station!! They students from veterinaria, pedagogy and several other courses were celebrating their party with several bands playing there!! the fire got so fast there was no time to everybody get out, so they found the exits closed by the time, most died the same as american embassador in libia inhaling toxic smoke even some that get out then died for this reason

AnotherTexanSo many political statements when the primary problem is fireworks indoors. Musical entertainment no longer depends on the ability to carry a tune, create a beat, tell a story in stanzas. Instead, it's shock value or fireworks. Overcrowding laws aren't enforced in any country. Building codes may be well-written - currently, but remodeling old structures are grandfathered. No matter where such a tragedy occurs, bottom line is making money.
The name calling in these comments continue to be indicative of the anger and bitterness between the left and right political platforms in the United States. Lincoln understood that a nation divided will not stand. Today's citizens have yet to understand. Respond to the families in pain before lashing out at others, please.1 vote#184 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:52 PM ESTGeorge DisrespectfulKeep voting Republican! Regulations are bad. I heard last week Obama was going to take away your knives.1 vote#185 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 2:53 PM ESTSandro Mottavia FacebookIt´s said that shirtless firefighters were trying knock down the outside walls but they weren´t firefighters, thery were just volunteers. Amazing Jeff Black having reported "shirtless firefighters"#186 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:00 PM ESTEdson LisboaYou kind of right Stevephoenix if we start talking about corruption!! that is the top topic in brazilian politics now.There has been more than 12 years now that these cuban admirers took the government here, so they are master in spread their way of corruption! To deafeat them is the hardest thing because during this time they are changing and placing all their people in strategical political position as for instance the brazilian Supreme Court, and they have the total control of our FED, treasury!! They just are forming a government of alied politicians that share all their way to do public policy!! Everyone who contest them are just expelled from their government!! In other words they took control of the brazilian government, the put pressure on the oppositon, and denounces from the brazilian press too!! That is the way the leftists do politics in brazil and in latin american countries!! They are acting in latin block to stop the american democracy and businesses influences down here!! That is a perfect analisyes you can get if you keep in touch of the daily politics here!! Lula was a idol for ignorant and illiterated brazilian voters, he reaches the the right word with these people!! but at the same time his party and government buy political opponents and take control of congress, judiciary so easy like this!!#187 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:10 PM ESTmbreenThis is not about building codes, its about being stupid. And there is no other word for any adult who goes INSIDE a building to watch INDOOR fireworks. End of discussion. While I feel bad for their families and friends, there was something wrong with these people in the first place if they didn't understand they were engaging in very dangerous behavior by going into this nightclub. If a band needs indoor pyrotechnics to put over their "music" to their followers, then maybe they aren't such a great group in the first place.#188 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:11 PM ESTDefMode66Fire Sprinklers DO save lives!#189 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:18 PM ESTFed -2094313I think we should out law night clubs becuase people don't kill poeple night clubs do. just like gun. I cant remember when guns kill this many people. Lets get new regulations for night clubs. We will all feel better any way1 vote#190 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:19 PM ESTGeorge DisrespectfulBut it's our right to watch indoor fireworks. You can have my fireworks when you pry them from my cold dead hand!!!1 vote#191 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:19 PM ESTGordon Nelson-4084835Far to many times these things happen, are we really that stupid to continue to put fire  (piro technic shows ) inside a building with people !! Its dangerous enough to have shows like this outdoors. I sure hope whomever allowed this to take place never get to walk the streets again .  So many inocent lives lost again to the mighty dollar . RIP to all those who lost thier live so needlessly.#192 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:20 PM ESTNo PocketsBands that use fireworks/pyrotechnics in a CLUB setting are making up for lack of music ability. I've seen Rush, Frank Marino and Mahogany Rush, Nugent, and other on-their-way-up bands play in clubs without the use of fire.
It's just too dangerpus to use pyro effects in small venues!#193 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:26 PM EST

yuraphagI guess they never heard of Whitesnake in Brazil.#194 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:29 PM ESTLee Crow-7696491How do you have a club that size with only 1 exit...What the f@ck!!!#195 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:32 PM ESTAmos MasurrpianskiSo sorry about the people dying in the fire.  However, apparently they packed in too many people and the exit signs were not visible.  In a raging fire like that a person succumbs very fast as panic sets in and people are trampled to death as well.#196 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:38 PM ESTJump to discussion page: 1 ...  5 6 7 8 9 ...  14Leave a Comment:Name: Email Address (will be verified, but never shown): You're in Easy Mode.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton faces tough questions in her long-awaited congressional testimony concerning the assault on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.
Clinton is the sole witness Wednesday at back-to-back hearings before the Senate and House foreign policy panels on the September raid, an independent panel's review that harshly criticized the State Department and the steps the Obama administration is taking to beef up security at U.S. facilities worldwide.
Clinton had been scheduled to testify before Congress last month, but an illness, a concussion and a blood clot near her brain forced her to postpone her appearance.
Her marathon day on Capitol Hill will probably be her last in Congress before she steps down as secretary of state. President Barack Obama has nominated Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., to succeed her, and his swift Senate confirmation is widely expected. Kerry's confirmation hearing is scheduled for Thursday.
Clinton's testimony will focus on the attack after more than three months of Republican charges that the Obama administration ignored signs of a deteriorating security situation in Libya and cast an act of terrorism as mere protests over an anti-Muslim video in the heat of a presidential election. Washington officials suspect that militants linked to al-Qaida carried out the attack.
"It's been a cover-up from the beginning," Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the newest member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Tuesday.
Politics play an outsized role in any appearance by Clinton, who sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 and is the subject of constant speculation about a possible bid in 2016. The former first lady and New York senator — a polarizing figure dogged by controversy — is about to end her four-year tenure at the State Department with high favorable ratings.
A poll early last month by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press found 65 percent of Americans held a favorable impression of Clinton, compared with 29 percent unfavorable.
Challenging Clinton at the hearing will be two possible 2016 Republican presidential candidates — Florida's Marco Rubio and Kentucky's Rand Paul, also a new member of the committee.
Clinton did little to quiet the presidential chatter earlier this month when she returned to work at the State Department after her illness. On the subject of retirement, she said, "I don't know if that is a word I would use, but certainly stepping off the very fast track for a little while."
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday that Clinton would focus on the Accountability Review Board's independent assessment of the attack and the State Department's work to implement its findings.
"Systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department resulted in a Special Mission security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place," the panel said in its report last month.
The report singled out the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Near East Affairs, saying there appeared to be a lack of cooperation and confusion over protection at the mission in Benghazi. The report described a security vacuum in Libya after rebel forces toppled the decades-long regime of strongman Moammar Gadhafi.
The report made 29 recommendations to improve diplomatic security, particularly at high-threat posts.
Nuland said Clinton "pledged not only to accept all 29 of the recommendations, but to have the implementation of those recommendations well under way before her successor took over. So I think she'll want to give a status on that."
Asked for the number of State Department employees fired for their handling of Benghazi, Nuland said four people were put on administrative leave. They included Eric Boswell, who resigned from the position of assistant secretary of diplomatic security.
But Nuland declined to say if Boswell and the others still are working for the department in some capacity.
Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., a member of the Senate committee, questioned the status of the FBI investigation and whether any individual has been implicated.
"My last understanding is that there is no one currently still being held for questioning, no one's been prosecuted for this or held accountable even though the president promised that to be the case," he said.
Still, Barrasso insisted that the hearing will be respectful.
Presiding over the Senate session will be Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the next chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. It would be unusual for Kerry to oversee the hearing.
"My hope is we look at this as a positive constructive opportunity to build much greater security for our diplomatic missions across the world," Menendez said. "That's how I'm going to the hearing. I hope my colleagues have the same type of view."

9/12 the Libyan President told the British media it was an Al-Qaeda terrorist attack,
Why did they feel it neccessry to tell us a video caused it for two weeks..
Why does Americans have to get the real story of an attack on Americans from another country?

Two American Seals perished doing their job. Its time we hold the corrupt politicians to account for not doing theirs.

Standard answers for all Obama cabinet members," I don't recall." ," I'll get that information to you.", " I wasn't present when that decision was made.", "That was handled by another department.", " We always do everything we can to protect American lives."" My big toe hurts."

The Obama administration delayed this joke of a hearing until after his election and the main stream media sat on their hands and didn't force action on this treasonous act by Obama, clinton, Reid, Rice and the rest who were all involved in this murder! Don't expect for a minute that anything will result from this mock trial! Obama should be impeached....

She wont answer any important questions anyway... Or she'll just lie. Just like obama is doing now. Refusing to answer any of the important questions, and the media will keep portecting them at all costs.

This woman much like her husband know how to work the system! How convenient being excused from appearing before congress while in another country on a wine tasting mission, followed by a concussion, and now a blood clot! She will not be held accountable for her cover-up on the death of an Ambassador and 3 marines who were raped and murdered by the Muslim radicals! Business as usual for her and Biden who blatantly stated at his DNC debate that they knew nothing about the incident! Biden gets a raise in pay, and is allowed by the corrupt media and deceptive politicians to conduct business as usual! How pathetic the system is! Any ordinary citizens would wind up incarcerated. Arrogant political elitists that are defying the will of the people, applying different rules to us than they apply to themselves, and justifying any means to achieve their own ends. Also their messengers in the media are telling us every day why we should accept our fate. If we continue down the road with the present politicians, our chances of likely saving the sovereignty of our country will perish.

The PJ Tatler » AC-130U Gunship was On-Scene in Benghazi, Obama Admin Refused to Let It Fire (Updated) 
There are two state-of-the-art fire-control systems (FCSs) in a AC-130U, using television sensors,infrared sensors, and synthetic aperture strike radar. These fire control systems can see through the dark of night, clouds, and smoke.
The two FCSs on the AC-130U control a 25mm Gatling gun for area suppression, a precision 40mm cannon, and a 105mm cannon which can engage hard targets.
What this means is that we have the forces in the air and on the ground to have stopped the attack at any point, eliminating the terrorists and saving American lives.
It seems it is more important to protect his Muslim buddies, than to save American lives.

She is as proficient a liar as her hubby so don't expect to see her falling on her sword.  It's always the pesky low level employees who are too blame, never the top dog.

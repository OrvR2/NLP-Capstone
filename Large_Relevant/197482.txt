The guy obviously is haunted and bothered by all that had happened. Why does anybody blame him or the band? What is he or anybody else supposed to do when something like this happens? Adrenaline, smoke, noise, confusion, what would anybody do in that situation? Do you want him to don his firesuit and save everybody in the building? Who on earth﻿ has the nerve to be judgemental unless they were placed in that situation? Sorry, but an average Joe in an 80's rock band should be a trained firefighter

I was Jack's Tour Manager in 2002 for his sol tour, right before the fire in 2003. I met Dan, knew everyone in the band, Ty, his g/f Heidi, Jack, and I have spoken to Jack after the tragedy and I can assure you he is not the same person. Dan was the final straw, but there are many to blame for﻿ the cause of the fire, but in the end, that doesn't bring justice or the dead back. I lost friends and co-workers in that fire, and not all victims died..some are alive today, some still live with it.

i dont know... i wouldve thought using pyrotechnics in a very small club venue was far from the smartest thing to do. also using an﻿ answering machine message to air someone else's "dirty laundry" on your album was asking for bad karma. anyway GW was always a half-assed hack act that Alan Niven tried to bring to success by using the clout he had while he managed GNR... not surprising it never really worked and there are only a handful of people in the world who give 2 shits about them today.

They used Gerbs, not candles or any kind of fire. It is the clubs job to know their﻿ own venue, they are the ones that are there everyday, they are the ones who book the bands.

The similiarities of the Station Fire and the Brazil fire this﻿ past weekend are gigantic. A band with flairs, people all running to the same door, 1 band member died in each event the others survived, 2 owners in each arrested, a stage manager accused of being the one to start the fire. The difference is that in Brazil so far 235 died, but there were at least twice as many people in the club in Brazil.

Responsibility falls on many shoulders, and they aren't flares, they were 15x15 Gerbs, which is a type of pyrotechnic device that shoots 15 feet for a 15 second burn time. Your ignorance is showing and your﻿ anger misdirected.

It's a shame he's haunted and "bothered". Most people who lived through that horror can't speak about it. Ole' Jack whines a bit and slides right into a conversation about 100 dead fans as if he were giving a lecture on foot fungus. Dan Biechele is the ONLY person who exhibited true sorrow and remorse. He LIT the﻿ pyros , yet he had the families of more than 15 victims write letters of support to the parole board. Jack is SO repulsive, Station victims' charities won't accept any funds from him.

I could give them a pass if this was their first or second time using pyros indoors. If it has been "hundreds" of other clubs, the tragedy is inexcusable and the bulk of the blame falls on the band. Why? Because that makes them the resident experts. They know far better than anyone﻿ else what to expect, The FIRST step is a thorough inspection of the premises. 400+ patrons assume you have taken every safety precaution and feel safe. Before you light that candle, you'd better make sure they're ok

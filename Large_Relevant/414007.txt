5daysagoPolice: Brazil nightclub fire kills at least 233A fire broke out early Sunday morning at a night club in Santa Maria, in southern Brazil, killing revelers — many of them students. NBC's Mike Taibbi reports. By Jeff Black, Staff Writer, NBC NewsUpdated at 1:23 a.m. ET: At least 233 people were killed after a band’s fireworks show sparked a rapidly moving fire in a packed nightclub in southern Brazil and fleeing patrons were unable to find their way out, local police said.Follow @NBCNewsWorld
 The bodies removed from the Kiss nightclub in the southern city of Santa Maria were taken to the Municipal Sports Center gymnasium for identification, police said.Major Gerson da Rosa Ferreira, who led rescue efforts at the scene for the military police, told Reuters that the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled. Police Maj. Cleberson Braida Bastianello told the Associated Press by telephone that the toll had risen to 233 with the death of a hospitalized victim.

Officials earlier counted 232 bodies that had been brought to the gymnasium in Santa Maria.In addition to the number of deaths, more  than 100 people were injured, police said, and most remain hospitalized. Police officials had reported earlier in the day that 245 people were  killed. The  death toll could still rise, police said later, from the  people who are  injured.Fire brigade colonel Guido Pedroso de Melo told O Globo newspaper that rescuers had difficulty entering the premises because of "a barrier of bodies" at  the entrance to the club.Television footage monitored by Reuters overnight showed people crying outside the club as shirtless firefighters used sledge hammers and axes to knock down an exterior wall to open up an exit. Agencia RBS via APPeople help a man injured in a nightclub fire in Santa Maria city, Brazil, on Sunday.Rodrigo Moura, who the newspaper Diario de Santa Maria identified as a security guard at the club, said it was at its capacity of between 1,000 and 2,000 people and patrons were pushing and shoving to escape, the AP reported. Police estimated the crowd at some 900 revelers.Fire officials said at least one exit was locked and that club bouncers, who at  first thought those fleeing were trying to skip out on bar tabs, initially  blocked patrons from leaving, Reuters reported.The club's management said in a statement it would help authorities with their investigation, Reuters reported.One of the club's owners has surrendered to police for questioning, GloboNews TV reported. "It was really fast. There was a lot of smoke, really dark smoke," survivor Aline Santos Silva, 29, told Globonews TV. "We were only able to get out quickly because we were in a VIP area close to the door." President Dilma Rousseff cut short a visit to Chile and visited families of the victims at the Municipal Sports Center, where relatives were gathering to identify the bodies. She met with relatives of the injured at Hospital de Caridade de Santa Maria.Rousseff declared a national three-day mourning period for victims of the fire. “Sad Sunday!” Tarso Genro, the governor of Rio Grande do Sul state where the club is located, tweeted. “We are taking all of the possible and appropriate actions,” the tweet read, according to a rough translation by NBC News. “I will be in Santa Maria later this morning.”The precise cause of the fire was still under investigation, authorities said. But Luiza Sousa, a civil police official in Santa Maria, told Reuters that the blaze started when someone with the band ignited what was described as a flare, which then set fire to the ceiling. The fire spread "in seconds," Sousa said. The tragedy in Brazil recalled other nightclub disaster. A fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in 2003 killed 100 people after pyrotechnics used on stage by the rock band Great White set ablaze foam used for soundproofing on the walls. A Buenos Aires nightclub blaze in 2004 killed nearly 200 people. Reuters noted that Brazil's safety standards and emergency response capabilities are under particular scrutiny as the country prepares to host the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Brazilian state’s Health secretary, Ciro Simoni, told the news service that emergency medical supplies from all over the state were being sent to the scene. Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore related topics: brazil, fire, nightclub, featured

But why is it that the President cut short a visit to Chile, to visit with the families, that must have taken some travel time, and the govenor will show up tomorrow?  At least it seems that one of them has his priorities in order.  Prayers are with all.1 vote#340 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:52 AM ESTLICABrasil with a "S" in Portuguese, with a "Z" in English. Just to clarify. The report says "shirtless firefighters" . Those shirtless men were people trying to help to brake the walls from outside, they were people that were able to flea the nightclub and passbyers. The firefighters were wearing their aproppriate atire. Brasil is a great country and they are working hard on fighting corruption. The case in there was one of the menbers of the band  fired a flare. The other members of the band didn't know he was going to do that. One of their members died. They woudn't put their own lives in danger doing that. They play all over south of Brasil and they do outdoors shows with all kinds of fireworks, but inside they never do it. I don't know what was in the guy mind to do that. The nightclub didn't have works prepared to help evacuet the place and also not enough emergency exits. A lot of people ran to the restrooms and end up dieing of sufocation by the thicky smoke. A huge tragedy , they were all too young. God give their families strengh to stand their losses.3 votes#341 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:55 AM ESTKen MartelliThis is sad indeed. Just think of all the lives that could have been saved if we banned clubs and bars. We need more Club and Bar control. Where is the Gov when we need it. We need laws to prevent such things. GOV please save us! Ban the Bars and Clubs. Ban alcholol and tobacco and anything sharp we may cut ourselves on. Lets just be lemmings.2 votes#342 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:00 AM ESTLICAI just can't believe some people are making fun of such a tragedy. May God be kind with you!3 votes#343 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:07 AM ESTchief1055@ Lica  Thank you for your post, I agree with you, and thanks for your incite.  As to those others making fun, I believe them to be disgruntled Americans, unhappy with what is going on in the USA, and their comments have nothing to do with this story.  WE will soon see if I am right.  Prayers with all of you.1 vote#343.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:19 AM ESTDavid KandaWhat's wrong with the security and bouncers that wouldn't let people out? Didn't they realize that something was wrong and people were panicing and needed to flee? Obviously NOT. Something's wrong with this place. But the real questions are: (1) Did the club have a sprinkler system? (2) Why do the doors don't have exit signs? (3) Were fire codes properly in place? To tell you the truth, I don't think so, and furthermore, I doubt the club was being managed properly. Afterall, a thousand more people allowed in and club was at over capacity. That just goes to show you that the only thing management is concerned about is making money. Total greed and total disregard for people's lives. Shameful!!2 votes#344 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:08 AM ESTSaturnallia9How Horrible, I have traveled to Brazil many times, and found the people there very fun loving and happy. My heart goes out to all the victims and their loved ones. What a terrible tragedy.#345 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:40 AM ESTmishesmarieSanta Maria. Hard to believe..#346 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:00 AM ESTLICAThanks chief1055. Very sad tragedy. As sad as when that teen shot and killed the kids at that school recently. I'm a mother of a 18 year old boy and I can't even stand the idea of loosing him, specially in such a terrible way. My heart goes out for their souls and those families left behind.#347 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:05 AM ESTKara SontibaybayMay the innocent who lost their lives find happiness in their After Lives.
And the corrupt go to hell!!#348 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:45 AM ESTBillLumberghPyrotechnics inside a club; everyone should pretty much have the message by now that it's a bad idea.  It seems like the worse a band sucks, the more likely they are to have fireworks instead of good music.  But it's one thing in an arena, and another in these nightclubs that are obviously not designed for it or not up to what should be modern fire code standards. #349 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:59 AM EST

jujubefruitIt's the catholic pope and his army of catholics thinking that they can rule the world with unity and then have unity to do businesses with...
For example, in the 1990s the catholic uses mexican catholics to his own agenda to steal money AND wealth  from him the rich chinese.   Now, it looks like the pope and his army of catholic priests are accelerating their agendas in brazil---because the mexicans are useless now to him.
So, I figure I help the world one story at a time.    In brazil, they don't speak mexicans, they speak Portuguese.  So, while the the pope works on mexico, he had his priests work on brazil.  That's the 1980s.  By 2000, the ppope's work is obviously not in tune with God's grace--the catholic pope himself can't seem to find the holy  grail like a devil can't find a holy grail.   In a city in brazil with there is a huge statue standing on the hilltop looking in to the bay area, there exists a catholic compound where child molesting priests or bad priest are sent to for healing or a brain washing or something.   From this compound, a new priest is born with a new identity to serve God and relocates to other geolocation around the world.  ---this compound is where nuns can get rape and the world will not know for itis bless by the pope himself.   Even before he was pope he still get the previous pope to bless it. #350 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:06 AM ESTJohnnyZapHey Jujubefruit
Don't forget it was the Vatican that did the entire 9/11 conspiracy for the purpose of getting more people to church to pray and stealing all those donations.
And it was the Vatican that was behind all the conflicts in Iraq and Iran and Afghanistan. All the entire banking meltdown of 2009 was the popes fault, Aids, every murder ever committed, tooth decay, poor eyesight, the Somalia pirates work for the pope, and most every fire has been set by a priest.
You sir are an idiot.#350.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 6:42 AM ESTjujubefruitJohnnyZap,
why don't you ask a catholic priest to see the pope then when he's done, ask the pope yourself if he blame him the rich chinese of whipping a department of mexican employee during business hours in the 1990s?
Then ask a mexican you know. ask them to read my post.    I think you will find that there is proof in the mexican people that will make white people lie until they can't lie no more.   then what?   set you up to with a job to lie for them too?
keep following my post if you don't believe.   A lot of people got hurt by the catholic pope.  And johnnyzap choose to stand up for the catholic pope with one billion catholic just did reading and not responding making johnnyzap the fool's hero.#350.2 - Tue Jan 29, 2013 7:57 AM ESTjujubefruitBasically the pope steals money from a private wealthy asian man since the 1970s.  then spreads it around to primarily catholic people around the globe.   For example, before he move stolen move to mexico, he sent catholic to mexico, then he put catholic in charge of spending the money.   So, you see catholic gringo in mexico originally do not have money.  They get money stolen from him the rich chinese since the 1970s.  But that is small problem.  Him the rich chinese made more, and the pope can't take all of it yet.   The american government made a deal with him the rich chinese, provide two envoy to provide for direct communication to washington.   These two envoys were introduce as Allen Greenspan (who later took job at Federal Reserve) and Al Gore who was young, not marry, wanted to do government work in washington (Al Gore became usa vice president).  Both has initial of A.G.   Alot happens.  But then in 1994 the accusation by the catholic pope that accuses him the rich chinese of whipping an accounting department full of mexican employeee was use by washington to excercise justice and allow washington to seize all wealth from him the rich chinese.   The catholic pope took personal credit for inventions made by him the rich chinese too.  So, everyone still think the pope did all that.   But the catholic pope is only a genius monk from the beginning who likes to sodomize others using his genius.
So johnnzap the fool's hero,  Welcome to your nightmare.   In time, history will be made evident and into your life because you are smart to ask questions that don't make sense so far.  Why are so many news account of molesting by priests?   Who's seize the day to become pope of these monks?   Its all white people too, and now mexicans with them or not.   You dunno do you?
I use words too like the pope did to accuse him the rich chinese to steal and to allow washington to steal.  tsk tsk for white people in washington and EU.   Hint: him the rich chinese was everywhere before white people spreadout in EU and where every like brazil, mexico, australia, africa, oui oui.#350.3 - Tue Jan 29, 2013 8:26 AM ESTjujubefruitHow to console the losers with poetry:
lore there was thor.
behold a mighty warrior leader.
no fear no fear no fear.
he chose he can't afford suckers.
It is not meant he is poor, just that he wants something else more sweet.
like it is so from sweet honey to a sweet winning kick.

A poster spelled it Brasil, and that is also correct.   Not all countries/nationalties/languages spell things the same way.  In fact, most of the spellings we use in the US for the names of other countries are not at all the same as the countries call themselves.#358 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:48 AM ESTjohn algarmeJust like cattle or sheep trapped in a burning barn, moo, moo, baa, baa !

I traveled Brazil & Venezuela for work in the 90's and had an opportunity to visit a few of the more famous clubs at the time, and I was amazed it how packed the places were, it was actually frightening. I'm talking New Year's Eve in Times Square packed for the entire place. It literally took over an hour to get to the bar from the front door.
They have always been tragedies waiting to happen. 
All our prayers go out to the families. May they all rest in piece.#363 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 6:36 AM ESTBanascharCollect all the owners, lock in dark sealed room, light on fire, walk away.#364 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 7:06 AM ESTJump to discussion page: 1 ...  11 12 13 14Leave a Comment:Name: Email Address (will be verified, but never shown): You're in Easy Mode.

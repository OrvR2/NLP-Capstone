Why does the news continue to show the faces and say the names of the pieces of shit that do these things. ﻿ They deserve no glory or fame. Fuck them and anyone with the same ideals as them. They are terrible human beings.

I just had﻿ an epiphany...
Guess what. If the US never built embassies all over the fucking planet then they wouldn't be bombed because they wouldn't exist.
But yeah, let's keep trying for that world peace shit by putting our crap in other people's countries. It looks like it is working just swimmingly...

Governor Romney advocates﻿ a policy of peace through strength and being aware of the serious threat of radical Islam to world peace. He expressed that “peace through strength “must be achieved through maintaining a strong military.”
Obama when pressed about the failure of Arab Spring, the dangers of radical Islam, and his peculiar approach of downsizing the U.S. military in the face of growing world terrorism, did what he has often done when confronted with the aforementioned issues.

There's no radical Islam. It's people pissed off that our standing armies are in their countries, so they defend their country and shoot at US troops...which automatically makes them radical Islam fundamentalist terrorists!
I guarantee...flip the tables, and if a country invaded the US, Americans﻿ would fight back. Get how this simple nationalism blind US pride works?

Israel is like a close cousin to us. I don't know about you but I would never give up or turn my back on someone that that would support us through anything. They are one of﻿ the US's closes and most reliable allies.

Yes, it was indeed﻿ an unfortunate affair. And you are also correct that the majority of Americans do not know anything about the incident. If I had go about talking about this to anyone, which I did in the most casual setting, there would be a great chance that they are perceiving me as some kind of a amateur conspiracy theorist, or somewhere along the line of that.

Oh okay so did Americans rape the woman on the bus in India? I understand frustration with our government but your statement is a blanket statement and unfounded, not educated. When some one blames some one for every problem in the world then one has to wonder how that person handles their own personal decisions﻿ in their own life.

"Arab spring" is the swarming of the locust in the book of Revelation 9. They﻿ are from the bottomless pit. Full of smoke. Just like Obama. They are pretending to be religious. All wearing crown of "turban" as if they are kings. Wait till their leader shows up. His names spelled out by two languages and you can't miss it.

So let me get this straight. According to your profile, you live in the United Sates yet you condemn﻿ the United States? That makes no sense and given the fact that your profile was created in January 2013 you are either a non-existent fraud or an eastern religious fanatic.

 A shill troll. There are people who make profiles that list they are in America﻿ but post things like that as to influence other Americans. Just ignore them, and flag them for spam. After a while it gets pretty stale and predictable and also obvious.

So you're saying follow war with more war? Violence with more violence? Yeah, that's exactly how we should go forward. Maybe we should bring home the﻿ majority of our troops and maybe close most of the 130+ military bases we have around the world and stop meddling in the affairs of other nations when we have more than enough problems of our own we still need to address. Fixing our own problems would help the world more than your suggestion.

You MUST be a Liberal. Only a Liberal would literally make up a number like you obviously did and believe their own created data.
Obama ~ 10 attacks in 4 years 7 of those attacks﻿ were in the last 2 years after they were sure Obama swallowed.
Bush ~ 5 attacked in 8 years
So, if Obama maintains his average it will be:
Obama ~ 18 attacks
Bush ~ 5 attacks
That's the empirical data. Something a Liberal would know nothing about because they all belong to the Religion of Intellectualism.

We're not afraid. The whole of the Western world is in DENIAL. But unlike the rest of Western civilization. America is still uncivilized. Millions of us are﻿ heavily armed. Most of us are just moderately armed. When it's clear that Obama's Knee Pad diplomacy has brought Islam to our door for forced conversion by the sword, we'll give Islam lead poisoning. Let's hope most Muslims are like you and American gun ownership is the preventative.

"A Marxist"...lollll
Gladio Revisited
watch?v=bsWHafahbvs
In an interview with James Corbett, Sybil Edmonds explains how Turkey was the epicenter of Operation Gladio and how its chief henchman, Interpol's #1 wanted, ran its operations out of﻿ Chicago. The whole thing was exposed when he was killed in a car accident, along with Turkey's chief of police and several Turkish MPs. A local ambulance and reporter arrived before "authorities" could get there to do damage control.

Grow a brain already. Better yet, why don't you piss﻿ & moan about the dozen U.S. embassies that were attacked on Bush's watch. And I think you wing-nuts should be looking to fire some Pubturds. Better late than never, I always say.

to the deranged mind of a conspiracy theorist, everything, even things that people take full responsibility for, is a false flag﻿ operation.

The PM of Turkey said that they needed unity in solving this crime a few days ago. Just like in Benghazi, people there were holding up signs saying sorry, they were not happy with the murder. You can't go saying all of Turkey is responsible for this because of the actions of an extremist. That is like saying all Americans are a like and because we have our own number of nut cases here not all of us﻿ are like that.

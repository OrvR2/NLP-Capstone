NewYorker.com's Socarides on death of fmr. NYC Mayor Koch: He was New York 
FROM CNN WIRES:
Ed Koch, the brash former New York City mayor who typically greeted constituents with a "How'm I doin'?" died Friday at the age of 88, his spokesman said.

The lawyer-turned-public servant was a U.S. congressman from 1968 until he ran for mayor of the city in 1977 He served three terms until David Dinkins defeated him in a Democratic primary.
This morning on "Early Start," NewYorker.com writer Richard Socarides looks back at Koch's legacy.

Family mourns for teen shot after inauguration performance, suggest changes to gun laws 
FROM CNN WIRES:
Chicago (CNN) - A teen who performed at events around President Barack Obama's inauguration was shot to death in Chicago this week, and now her story has become part of the debate in Washington over gun violence nationwide.
The shooting death of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton came up in a U.S. Senate hearing and a White House press briefing Wednesday.
"She was an honor student and a majorette," said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois. Performing at inaugural events last week "was the highlight of her young, 15-year-old life," he said.
Speaking at Wednesday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun violence, Durbin mentioned Pendleton's death as he argued that more must be done to stop gun crimes.
"Yesterday, in a rainstorm after school, she raced to a shelter. A gunman came in and shot her dead," he said. "Just a matter of days after the happiest day of her life, she's gone."
The park shelter where she was shot is just a mile from Obama's home in Chicago.
This morning on "Early Start," Hadiya's dad Nathaniel and godfather Damon Stewart talk about her legacy, and changes they hope to see in gun control laws.

Gunman holds 6-year-old boy in underground bunker for third day in standoff – George Howell reports 
It is day three now of a tense standoff in Alabama, where a gunman is holding a six-year-old boy hostage in an underground bunker. Police say the boy was dragged off a school bus Tuesday afternoon in Midland City after the gunman shot and killed the school bus driver.
Authorities are communicating with the suspect through a PVC tube. They've also sent down prescription medicine, crayons and coloring books for the six-year-old hostage. School officials are calling the driver a hero. They say Charles Poland Jr.’s quick thinking saved the lives of 21 children. CNN’s George Howell is live in Midland City with the latest.

When NBC and MSNBC decide to invest in a President, and the rest of the liberal media follows, NOBODY CAN STOP US! We invested in President Obama and now NOBODY CAN﻿ STOP US!

"White House﻿ Okays Use Of Child Soldiers To Fight Terrorism"﻿ 3/18/12
Obama waives sanctions against Chad, the Congo, Sudan, and Yemen for using child soldiers because they are “strategically important” in fighting terrorism.
The Child Soldier’s Prevention Act makes it illegal to sell arms to any nation that﻿ uses children as soldiers...Obama just decided to leave countless kids stranded on some of the world’s bloodiest battlegrounds.

Us Democrats have an agenda. We have an agenda we want to promote, and television is one of the mediums we use to promote that agenda, and at 3pm NOBODY does a better job﻿ of promoting the Democratic Agenda and driving it home than our girl Brooke Baldwin. She's in the CNN Newsroom now driving it home.

"Firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself. They are the people's liberty teeth keystone... the rifle and the pistol are equally indispensable... more than 99% of them by their silence indicate﻿ that they are in safe and sane hands. The very atmosphere of﻿ firearms everywhere restrains evil interference. When firearms go, all goes, we need them every hour."
—George Washington (Address to 1st session of﻿ Congress)

If Mitt Romney is a Neocon then so is Barack Obama:
-
What's Romney think of Obama's﻿ Bush-like war policies? He agrees with pretty much all of﻿ them. In the last debate, Romney essentially echoed everything Obama said, attempting unconvincingly to sound critical while heaping praise on Obama's most conspicuous foreign policy initiatives, approving of the illegal drone killings "entirely," and he approves of the escalation of the war in Afghanistan.

With Obamacare for Americans right around the corner﻿ and the possible end of the 2nd Amendment in site should our beloved members of Congress pass﻿ the draconian gun control bill? Americans need to take a look at some startling facts: More Brits died from National Health care than Americans were killed by guns in 2011.
In 2011, 8,583 Americans were killed with guns. Meanwhile in the UK, the National Health Service is killing 12,000 a year.

BBC: Al Qaeda Does﻿ Not Exist: CIA and US/UK Media Created It
There’s no such thing as al-Qaeda – It’s a fraud perpetrated on the British & American people by Banksters, to scare us into submission. While bin Laden did have links to Islamic fundamentalists and terrorists, he﻿ was not the leader of Al Qaeda. The US govt built him up into such a figure to give Americans a face – an enemy – to hate in their push for public support of multiple wars in the middle east

Although﻿ Obama pledged to end the so-called ‘War on Terror’
“Instead, he has been just as ruthless and indifferent to the rule of law as his predecessor … while President Bush issued a call to arms to defend ‘civilisation’ against the threat of terrorism, President Obama has waged his war on terror in the shadows, using drone strikes, special operations and sophisticated surveillance to fight a brutal covert war against al-Qaida and other Islamist networks”
-Former Obama Advisor Michael﻿ Boyle

The War On Terror Spreads to Africa: U.S. Sending Troops to 35 African Nations
-
U.S. Army teams will be deploying﻿ to as many as 35 African countries early next year for training programs and other operations as part of an increased Pentagon role in Africa. The move would see small teams of U.S. troops dispatched to countries with groups allegedly linked to al-Qaeda, such as Libya,﻿ Sudan, Algeria and Niger.

People should really consult history, declassified documents, and testimonies of former government officials when it comes to solving problems and trusting govt. People are so comfortable to just give up rights these days its pathetic. They have countries for the weak, scared ,﻿ and govt trusting and dependent people to go to. You speak against our Constitution and rights...go move to England or China to a govt that suits you better.

We are NOT poised for a good year, lie #1. "As long as Washington politics don't get in our way" basically he is opening the door to blame the Republicans AGAIN. WAKE UP DEMOCRATS Obama didn't fix anything. Our debt grew MORE in his FIRST term than both of bush's terms COMBINED. In psychology there is a very simple lecture that is taught to first years students. When somebody blame's there problems on others it is because they are insecure. OUR PRESIDENT SUCKS﻿ , WAKE UP PEOPLE.

Yes he will, and why not? How will anybody not know Obama does not suck when he is only running the country 50% at best of how he wants to run it?
Twice the American people chose him to run the country, you are insulting the intelligence of﻿ some +62 millions Americans.

You know what was never a safe bet, Barry? Electing some Impostor like you in to the White House. When was the last time or the only time you spent one day of your pathetic presidency trying to create jobs? We've had so many false flag golden globes occurring, why should the sheep even﻿ bother going to the movies anymore? They can just sit at home, turn on CNN, the Communist Noose Network, and see the worst piece of fiction ever made.
Now back to your fantasy football you useless beading sheep.

I don't get Republicans who blame Obama for the state of America.
Imagine someone constantly trying to put some type of spice in a soup you are preparing, which the household HAS preferred that you do. You have a﻿ clear vision of how it should be, the household has choosen you to prepare the soup, but some jerk keeps trying to put in ingredients of their soup because they weren't chosen to cook for the household.
How the fuck do you expect to get the sweet tasty soup the chosen cook intended?

Tell﻿ your god damn Republicans to let the man be, let him run the country for the 4 years he was given by the electrote and assess him then instead of trying to force their way of running government in ALL THE TIME then blaming him for the country going to shit.

this is the problem that this country is now facing. we live in a society where alot of the people who voted for this disgrace of a president are expecting handouts as well as wanting the government to go after those who earn and create jobs. this is really hurting our country and has made us a sub class﻿ society. take from the rich to give to the poor. the only problem is that most of the poor who will be taking from the rich refuse to work . this creates more laziness and deference.

Are you baggers as idiotic as you comments? You're either morons or liars, but more likely both. Your war criminal turned record surpluses and job growth, into record deficits and job loss. Your party of incompetent corporate whoring liars palmed their economic catastrophe, unfunded mismanaged wars, and﻿ unfunded tax cuts off on President Obama. They made their priority to cause President Obama to fail. They obstructed bills to increase employment and revenue then blamed Obama for their failures.

Facts? When do you hollow headed mongoloids ever discuss facts? All you do is throw shit and piss all over yourselves. You lie like ten dollar street whores, you're a disgrace and embarrassment to America. Your ignorance is﻿ the reason that millions of Americans are suffering, the economic downfall of 2008, the illegal invasion of Iraq, the deaths of thousands of American solders, tens of thousands of Iraqi men women and children are dead, massive debt, and millions of unemployed workers.

How can president Obama cut the deficit in half while your lying rats are obstructing his efforts to increase employment, increase revenue, and rebuild the infrastructure? We're still﻿ running on republican economic policies, bush cuts just ended. If you don't like republican failure, bitch at your republicans. You rats want to starve children, close schools and hospitals to pay the cost for republican destruction and incompetence but Democrats aren't falling for your ignorance and incompetence.

Most of the people who are currently in need of government aid were put in this position because you brainless hate saturated losers are too stupid to elect a competent leader. Millions of Americans lost everything because you vile shit eating rats fucked up by electing the worst mistake in American history, and you brainless dolts are too stupid to know the difference. You just blame﻿ the victims of your ignorance and ask for another incompetent lying rat to lead you ignorant losers.

He saved America from a republican led collapse and put America on the road to recovery ahead of the world. Did﻿ that answer your question?

Mr. President, raising the debt limit is not "paying the bills we've already﻿ racked up." It is "taking on more debt" and not fixing the problem, which is not keeping a budget.
Most families in this country have had to cut their household budget due to the SS tax holiday expiring. The government should do the same.
Time to sell stuff on craigslist, Mr. President. Anything not nailed down. Pay your bills by raising funds and cutting the budget, not borrowing more (creating more obligations).

It really is bills we've already racked up. Congress already approved the spending (republicans and democrats) -so whether or﻿ not the debt ceiling is raised they're gonna have to pay for the wars, entitlements and agencies (with money we don't have). If the republicans are so against raising the debt ceiling- they shouldn't have started our wars.
And besides what do you want to see Obama "sell". Medicare? Medicaid? Social Security? the FDA? Don't you think most Americans like those?

Thats right! If Ronmey had won the presidency, I guarantee you that by the end of the year we would be at war with Iran, and possibly N. Korea, and maybe even Egypt!! He, and Republicans spent way too much time talking about it! I am so happy that Obama is focusing on helping the﻿ poor, and middle class! Expert economists were saying that if Ronmey had become president, the middle class would have virtually dissapeared by the end of 4 years!! Cheap labor jobs overseas, while the rich get richer!

I really think the best way to avoid loop holes in the tax system is a flat tax. Then it would be fair for every peculiar person! I played a game called Sim City 4. In order to balance my budget in order to avoid bankruptcy, I had to cut spending first and lower taxes for my city to grow, then I had less bills to pay. I wonder if﻿ that could work here? Stay strong, percieve well

Davis Marshall-Extreme communist﻿ that mentored Obama from the age of 13 to 22. William Wright-Rev of Obamas for 20 years-God damn america. I can keep going on and on.

Mr. President hope someone reads this messages. Just want to say thank you for being our president, all this friction and﻿ opposition just to do the most common sense things is just depressing. I pray our lord gives you wisdom and the force you need to lead this country.

You make a good point about saving the﻿ nation money on a fuel bill.. Our dependency on fuel only benifits oil tycoons no matter where the oil comes from really.. its about time they become clever enough to present us with a more worthy option, while still being cable of living like kings..

Remember HUD New York City, Tennessee, California, etc.
There were many in the classes
and even if they went up and into politics later in life...
how come there is no mentioning the dead at HUDBuffalo (no one knew how or by whom...today it is recalled to have been an attack by supervisors: Libyans going to war they said)

There wasn't a gun at HUD buffalo
but
drugs due to Libyans were doctors.
So what did the Presidents /wives allow? My gun gone due to drugs granted to me (and for me to die, Clintons thought ? That's what I heard, what did they say to the press about me, poor ol Dolores or the other 7 that are dead﻿ now).

How come I have to find my﻿ own US Constitution section
and then I contact the Federal Govt
about their slack. ?
How come they did not include the Disability Form in the Employment EXIT file that had to be done by me/OPM & due to I was 3/4 dead just 912 1/2 nights before. I have to leave...especially when I cannot find any other doctors who can tell me.... I went to work where the people can walk.
Having less brain-work ability & due to the same Govt job (due to drugs on staff & others dead)

I'm not a﻿ dead beat nation?
My fbi have been trying to set up their old old old friend
from high school
and now they are 50s
with "she went on tv Evangelism, instead of Leon Panetta's daughter who is the same age"
and they may owe Russia's Putin... he came around when he was also illegal & reported by me
However I did not know...he may have wanted me to go to Russia like the French Actor who just left. He changed his name here & went by name of Jim..and knew us in 1979.
Maybe they in 2000s.

THE TRUTH. . .
With the inevitable continuation of the current rate of corruption and decay it is only a matter of time before the groundwork is complete and our Caesar takes center stage. As our government continues to purge its ranks of all strong and noble﻿ men in favor the weak and decadent in order to pillage the treasury at will, it unwittingly clears the deck of all worthy opposition to a ruthless dictator. This dictator, as did Caesar, will usher in the final end to Western Civilization.

How did Congress order the Presidents & signatures (over the last 23 yrs) to take
away
Candise's Religion and it was due to Rich Sue Hinn talking to her on Canadian Soil
(or they say HUD employees had heard her speaking to Candi in Fall 1992 while purchasing a Pentacostal book).﻿
No FBI notes on that though; but his agents...wanted me to seek employment by asking the Queen of England.
Queen of England.
Queen of England. (and she wd respond due to their Church rules? yes they say)

George Washington and the Founders may have been revolutionaries, but they revered the noble traditions and were inspired by religious belief. Robespierre and Napoleon were true revolutionaries in the real liberal sense of the word. They were out to destroy the old order of privilege for the sake of their own power. They used the same slogans that we﻿ would see repeated by all the twentieth-century demagogues.

I shoot skeet /trap and no one sees me there.
But solely gun laws & the need for it came up ...by people who came from my college, my schools
and due to instigations by the area: Money up the kahoots due to Mortgage Banking w/fraud, donations granted﻿ out to area people & then I guess they got arrested. Man that gave latter was fbi/cia favorite to President and is supposed to be interrogated today & was "sent out to tell me that after his first night of questioning & by Nancy Reagan".

The very words "conservative" and "liberal" lay out the fundamental opposition; one seeks to preserve an existing order,﻿ the other to liberate from an existing order. The one reverences the traditions of the past; the other seeks a future free from the restraints of the past. One seeks to live up to high standard inherited from their ancestors; the other seeks to create a new order based upon their own ideas.

In my humble opinion, the arrogance of Washington could be crushed under the heel of national resistance. If this is done it very well could be a greater struggle than the one embedded in our heritage, which started in April 19, 1775﻿ in Middlesex County within the towns of Lexington and Concorde.

The Federal Government will try to turn its own people against one another with the use of the military and police forces. These are the very same people–the sons, daughters, moms, dads and grandparents–of those they order to strip their liberties. What type of a government can demand the﻿ destruction of their own people at the hands of their own family members?

The only one that never was paid by you USA President(s) was me.
These lists were always in the news, from time to time, but later get paid by the administration and me?
nothing has been paid.
You cannot & did not even define the problem? Like why do I do my own investigations of what happened at HUDBuffalo NY?
Did Libyans kill? Do I have $ now, after 22 yrs & I have a memory, to do that?
Do I seek an organization other than fbi, who were supposed to be on the job; but they﻿ became treason?

Do the citizens of the United States view Obama and the Federal Government as an oppressive force occupying Washington? There came a point in American history–April 19, 1775–that the colonists could no longer tolerate oppression of the﻿ occupying forces that consumed their rights and led to the revolution. It was a moment in history.

Democrats continue to break basic budget laws
For﻿ more than 1,350 days, Senate Democrats have failed to do their lawful duty and pass a budget. This has been widely reported and, among mostly non-Democratic Party-aligned media, rightly decried as irresponsible, illegal, etc. What is less often reported is President Obama’s failure to submit his budget proposal to Congress on time.

Trickle down economics has never worked and in fact led to the collapse of the Roman Empire. In the US, it has led the way to the biggest gap between rich & poor since late in the 18th Century. c. 1798
It was Ronald Reagan himself who was quoted as saying his biggest single regret from his time in office was the debt﻿ he left. The US National debt, under Reagan, increased by MORE THAN 320%

The thing that most of you dummies﻿ seem to ignore is the fact that spending IS down. The deficits are what they used to be, though interest from earlier economic policies led by Ronald Reagan who TRIPLED the debt and later by George43, who himself more than doubled the debt for which we are still responsible today.

Thank you Mr. President for your great speech. I really liked the answer you gave to chuck todd and the news man and women after him too. I laughed so long and hard with joy because Mr,
. President you have a lot of humor. It seems to me and a lot of Americans that most not all of the news media personnel﻿ there at the White House do not use comon sense, wisdom, or average intelligence. There is something wrong with most of the news media in the White House except Mr. Brian Williams. Thank you

Obama called it un-American to raise the debt ceiling on July 3, 2008. He actually voted against to raise the debt ceiling﻿ as senator. Obama promised to cut the deficit in half in February 2009. He said continuing spending is unsustainable. Now he recently said we don't have a spending problem. My oh my. How things change.... By the way, how you Obama supporters liking your smaller paychecks?

He is not my Pres! I would prefer a lightning bolt find his head. All he does is lie. The cuts he referred to are not cuts. He counts the money we stopped spending in Afghanistan. Thats like paying off a credit card﻿ then taking that money and counting it as surplus to spend on other things. I didnt expect much from a community organizer.

so we need to borrow more to pay our bills. Why even have a debt ceiling if we keep raising it Your spending cuts are a﻿ joke. They are on proposed spending increases. If I buy a chevy cobalt for 15000 instead of saying i was going to buy a corvette for 60000 i did not cut spending 45000! That's the way US government calculates its spending. What a joke. Here's another one I need to take out a home equity loan to make my mortgage payments. CUT SPENDING!!!!!!!!

Obama is worse than Bush, this guy is a total fraud. He lied about a dozen things he promised to "change" and yet the american sheeple don't give a flying fuck. Which is why Martial Law will soon be implemented. America: home of slaves, land of the sheep.﻿ I would write the list but I can't fit in on a single YouTube comment.

Thank you Mr. President for this great speech. I really liked that answer you gave to chuck todd and the﻿ news man that spoke after him. I laughed so long and hard with joy because you Mr. President have a lot of humor. :D It seems to me and a lot of Americans that most not all of the news media there at the White House do not use comon sense, wisdom or average intelligence. There is something wrong with most of the news personnel in the White House and it is not of God. Thank you Mr. President

"Firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself. They are the American people's liberty teeth and keystone under independence ... From the hour the Pilgrims landed, to the present day, events, occurrences, and tendencies prove that to insure peace, security and happiness, the rifle and pistol are equally indispensable . . .﻿ The very atmosphere of firearms everywhere restrains evil interference - they deserve a place of honor with all that is good" —George Washington

Yeah, but it's context. I don't think Washington could imagine a world in which a shoulder fired rifle could fire off 600 very accurate rounds per minute. In Washington's time you where lucky to fire off 3 rounds every minute and you where even luckier to﻿ actually hit something. Fire-arms for hunting, and handguns for self protection sure. Maybe even a semi auto rifle only accessible at a shooting range. (Knob Creek shoot) but not semi auto or full auto fire arms for every day use.

If President Obama is a dictator, then he is a very good dictator, and has the support of the vast majority of Americans!!!!! Also, polls show support for what he is doing!!!! People I talk to, hear talk about him, all support exactly what he is doing!!!!! If you are going against Obama, even﻿ if you do think he is wrong, you are going against the will of the vast majority of Americans!!!!! OBAMA IS AMERICA RIGHT NOW!!!!!

What is "vast majority" to you? Obama is most definitely not America﻿ and he is taking the country down a VERY dangerous path.

7 trillion debt,100 trillion in liabilities...Major depression,no jobs,broke nation,bankrupt States and Cities with little Police.
Lets﻿ start a shit storm to take﻿ away people's rights to protection and illegally pass assumed laws against the Constitution and Bill of Rights with a major debate for 4 years while our country collapses.
GREAT PLAN!
I hope the president realizes bypassing congress is illegal.﻿ Executive orders apply to the executive branch and within the federal government.

To Defend Against Evil...
…is the substantive rationale behind Americans’ Second Amendment right to bear arms. Which is why every effort to take that right away is the action of evil, and must be resisted and﻿ defeated.
“Truth always rests with the minority, and the minority is always stronger than the majority, because the minority is generally formed by those who really have an opinion, while the strength of a majority is illusory, formed by the gangs who have no opinion.

Well as Mr.Obama said at the end, look's like he will be a stick in the mud. To the White House,Senateb and Congress.﻿ Eliminate all programs that did not exist in President Johnson's first year of office,except keep Homeland Security. Then cut all programs by 10%,taxes will not be needed to be raised and the debt ceiling will be met.

Did you know according to FBI Crime statistics violent crime rate has declined since the AWB ending in 2004? Did you know that there are 88 guns for every 100 people in the US and yet it is ranked as the 25th most violent country in the world. But Britain has banned all guns, yet is ranked﻿ as the most violent country in the world, worse than the US and South Africa combined?

Well most likley the violent crime rates lowering since 2004 had nothing to do with the AWB since it didnt actually change﻿ how any AW were being sold. Also peanut butter sales have increased since 2004, clearly linked.

I think what we should do is to look ﻿ closely to his agenda, what are the motive behind each move, for sure they are not trasnparent. For example he is using the tragedy at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, to desarm the american people, and go over the Second Amendment..this are some of the action that a dictatorship government does.

Taxing the rich is projected to raise 1 trillion over a decade and cut 1 trillion in spending in 2011. Its not perfect but its﻿ a start. Better than doing nothing.

No, it was something closer to $700B over 10 years, which is virtually﻿ nothing when our current deficits are over a Trillion every year. And your facts are WAY off or you are really deluded, there are not even near to 1 Trill in spending in 2011. If that were true we would have had nearly a balanced budget, but it was still well over 1 Trill.

Yep, cut funding to anything that doesn't need/deserve it. No matter how small. It all adds up. (Yes, just like the revenue on the rich. Congrats, you've got that revenue, now time to﻿ cut!)

Nobody cares how many Executive Orders Bush signed!!!! Because bush did not have to deal with such a non functional Congress!!!! What is important is, with all the obstructivness the republicans are showing in regard to the economy,﻿ and gun legislations, polls show that most Americans agree that President Obama has a mandate to write into law more legislation by way of Executive Order!!!!!!!

You do not know a thing about the constitution. The constitution restricts matters dealing with the debt ceiling, gun laws, executive authority. Which Obama has completely ignored. The constitution WASN'T UP FOR ELECTION. Only the Presidency was sport. And polls do not mean a fucking thing moron. Even tho﻿ you are completely wrong on the polling (STOP WATCHING MSNBC) no president has that authority to change the constitution by executive order. It is treason. And we are a REPUBLIC NOT A DEMOCRACY

Yes we did!!!! That is what most of us liked about him! We knew he was not afraid to stand up for what is right, and to legislate for us through Executive Order! Everyone I know of are hoping that he will be able to do what the republican congress obviously wont do!! What do the average American citizens need with a assault weapon anyway? This is so urgent, it needs to be done now!!!﻿ That is to ban assault weapons, require background checks to purchase at gun shows, and ban large magazines!!!!

Nice argument. A clear﻿ example where gun laws do not work but you want more gun laws. Makes sense. Are you making an argument for an all out ban on all guns? How does that work with the 2nd Amendment?

What do you mean by "assault weapon"? I am perfectly happy if you are﻿ suggesting enforcing existing gun control laws, stronger background checks. Sounds good to me.
And are you actually suggesting there are no gun control laws in Chicago for example?

Changing the subject? No, I just don't understand your point I guess. That the gun ban didn't work? Ok... still, what's your﻿ point?
Ok, if not all guns banned, how do you choose which to ban? Hand guns are responsible for the most murders, are you suggesting ban hand guns over assault rifles?

Well they were more suggestions then questions. What I believe for gun control laws is a different matter. Perhaps stricter background checks before buying guns, the same laws for buying guns at a show as there are in a store. If someone would show me some evidence﻿ I would give pretty easily on banning high capacity magazines. Happy?

I am all for strict background checks and for consistent regulations on those checks (stores, gun shows, private sales).
How does banning high capacity magazines does anything? Hand guns are used significantly more often than anything with a high capacity magazine. And how does that take it﻿ out of a criminal's hands? They will still have them and you reduce the law abiding citizen's freedom.

By banning high capacity magazines it would take new ones off the market making the ones in circulation the only ones available. They break, there aren't new ones so you cant buy them, law abiding citizen﻿ or criminal, it would make getting them harder.

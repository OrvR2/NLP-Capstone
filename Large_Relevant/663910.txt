Chile's Trapped Miners


As it happened


Graphics: Guide to rescue


New ordeal for miners? 


The winners



 The 33 miners - all Chileans except one miner from Bolivia - have a range of ages, experience and health conditions.
The men's health on the day of the rescue has been one of the key considerations for rescuers. First, they wanted the fittest with the most technical know-how, then the weakest, to be followed by the strongest characters who could cope with watching their colleagues leave the mine first.
Florencio Avalos was brought out first. Jimmy Sanchez, who had been showing signs of anxiety, was brought out fifth. He was the youngest miner at 19 and the father of a four-month-old baby.
The oldest of the group is Mario Gomez, 64, who has worked in the mines since the age of 12 and was thinking of retiring in November. He was the ninth to be brought out.
During their time underground, the miners split into three groups - Grupo Refugio, Grupo Rampa and Grupo 105, or the Refuge group, Ramp group and Group 105 - named after the shelter, the ramp and Level 105 sections of the 1km tunnel where they are trapped. 



Each group had a leader and they worked in shifts, as they did before the accident on 5 August. Meals were delivered by the supply bore holes in packages called "palomas" or doves. 
The  "palomas" have also carried medication, technical supplies, camp bed parts and messages to and from loved ones waiting on the surface.

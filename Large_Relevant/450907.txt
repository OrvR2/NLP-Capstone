Cornel West is full of hot air; a classic demagogue. For instance, here he states "..you don't use his (MLK's) prophetic fire as just a moment in a presidential pageantry without understanding the challenge he presents to all of those in power no matter what color they are". Aside from his poor grammar, West presumes to think he is the only one who empathizes with him (properly) and is therefore the best judge of what symbols (MLK's bible) may be used to invoke his memory.

The black guy is just painfully stupid. Difficult to argue with him because he is loud and won't shut up long enough for others to point out his patent absurdities.

My great-great grandmother was from Bieliczna. All that remains from the 12th century village is this church from 1796, which was restored not too long ago. The entire town was "depopulated" after WW2 by the commies; burned to the ground, with all the inhabitants "displaced". My other ancestors were from nearby Izby, which was Bieliczna's sister village and still exists with a small population.

Fucking douchebag kept on hitting after his opponent threw up his hands, the official signal in that country for "no mas". This allowed him to get several unblocked punches in. Fucking boxers have three fucking rules to remember but somehow are never penalized for it. Now a man is dead.

Why is my comment so unpopular - especially after explaining myself to all, including Phil X, who apparently understands what I'm getting at. Yes, he is playing different forms of the correct chords - but Page still plays it differently, which I believe makes a big difference in sound.

No doubt using his '59 Gibson Les Paul (Pearly Gates), just like in this video. I think he used Marshalls back then. As far as I know, only Angus Young from AC/DC plugs straight in (to a Marshall) these days - always has.

Thanks for sending the link! But I have seen this posted elsewhere; guess I forgot. Nonetheless, the guys were looking good all tarted up for TV, and in an ever rarer moment, Steve was playing his Fender Lead II instead of his Frankencaster. (I asked him about this guitar and he said he liked it very much (he used it for Punk Sandwich because he didn't like messing with his 'caster - it was tuned to down D) He said it was stolen in Atlanta around 1980. Cheers!

Tell it to the people in charge of what we see on TV regarding war, plane crashes, etc. Until we see the real horrors, we'll never be prepared mentally for life's realities. And the Kardashians actually are a great example of what NOT to become, so they should be watched by parents and children alike.

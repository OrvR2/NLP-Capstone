this is sooo much like Station Nightclub fire in Rhode Island. one exit, indoor pyro, insulating foam catching on fire, stupidly high body count (though 'only' 100 people died in RI). do people ever learn?

The last time I was at a club years ago, I was thinking about how doomed we all would be if there was a fire. The club was underground with only one exit through a narrow corridor (if there was another exit, it was certainly not marked), it was absolutely packed, everyone was wasted, and the dancefloor was flooded with smoke from a smoke machine, which meant you could barely even see anything. I would urge everyone who goes to a club to make a mental note of the best way to get out.

Oh wow, I'm straight going to hell. I laughed so hard at this. Also, isn't this a little reminiscent of the Station Fite that the band Great White set off with their own pyrotechnics?

Seriously? Whether or not there is a hell, I am not kidding when I say that you need help if you laughed at this. 233 people died in an absolutely terrifying situation. What about that is funny?

Hey Bands: sometimes pyrotechnics are completely unnecessary, just play your music. It sucks that the club owner gave two craps about having more exits and lets the overcrowding happen.

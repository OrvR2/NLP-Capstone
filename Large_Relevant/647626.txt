ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — The New Mexico teenager accused of gunning down his family over the weekend had reloaded his guns after the attacks and planned to go to a Wal-Mart and randomly shoot people, authorities said Tuesday.
Instead, 15-year-old Nehemiah Griego texted a picture of his dead mother to his 12-year-old girlfriend, then spent much of Saturday with the girl, they said. The two went to the church where his father had been a pastor, and Griego eventually admitted killing his parents and three younger siblings.
Bernalillo County Sheriff Dan Houston said Griego had planned the attack for a week, but it's unclear if he ever actually went to a Wal-Mart or why he changed his mind. The teen said he had planned to randomly shoot more people, then die in a shootout with law enforcement, according to authorities.
Griego told detectives he also contemplated killing his girlfriend's parents, Houston said at a news conference.
The teen was set to appear in adult court Tuesday on charges of murder and child abuse resulting in death. He was arrested Saturday at his family's home in a rural area southwest of Albuquerque.
It wasn't immediately clear if Griego's contact with his girlfriend avoided further bloodshed. But a statement of probable cause says Griego spent time at the church, first talking to his girlfriend and her grandmother and then meeting with the church pastor and a security guard.
Church officials called authorities, and Griego initially told arriving officers he had come home Saturday morning after spending time at a friend's house to discover his family dead.
The teen later confessed to shooting his mother because he "had anger issues" and was annoyed with her, the charging document said. He said he killed his siblings after they woke up and became upset, then grabbed his parents' assault rifle and waited in the downstairs bathroom to ambush his father.
After killing his father, Griego said he reloaded the guns so "he could drive to a populated area to murder more people," according to the statement.
His plan, the statement said, was to "shoot people at random and eventually be killed while exchanging gunfire with law enforcement."
Detectives spent two days collecting evidence and trying to piece together what led to the attacks, which occurred on the same day thousands of gun advocates gathered peacefully at state capitals around the country to rally against stricter limits on firearms. The "Guns Across America" events were being held just after President Barack Obama unveiled a sweeping package of federal gun-control proposals.
"There's no other way to say it, except that we have a horrific crime scene down there that we are working on," Bernalillo County Sheriff Dan Houston said Sunday.
The detectives had finished their work at the home by Monday afternoon. The metal gate at the home's entrance was shut, a small bouquet of purple flowers was on the top of the gate, and at each side there were religious signs, including one that read "Jesus is the reason for the season."
The sheriff's office identified the victims as Greg Griego, 51, his wife, Sarah Griego, 40, and three of their children: a 9-year-old boy, Zephania Griego, and daughters Jael Griego, 5, and Angelina Griego, 2. All appeared to have gunshot wounds to the head.
A sheriff's detective questioned the teen Saturday night, and the details of their conversation were spelled out in the statement.
The teen allegedly told the detective that he took a .22-caliber rifle from his parents' closet around midnight Saturday and shot his mother in the head while his younger brother slept next to her.
Griego told the detective that his brother woke up but did not believe him that their mother was dead, so he showed his mother's bloody face to his brother and then shot him, according to the statement.
The teen is accused of then shooting his two young sisters after they began crying in their room, and retrieving a military-style semi-automatic rifle from his parents' closet and waiting in a downstairs bathroom for his father to come home. The statement said he shot his father multiple times after he passed the bathroom doorway.
Greg Griego was a pastor who had once served at Calvary, one of Albuquerque's largest Christian churches. He also was well-known throughout the law enforcement community for his work as a voluntary chaplain.
A records check by the Children, Youth and Families Department indicated no problems with the Griego family and that Nehemiah Griego had never been in trouble with the law.
Sheriff's Deputy Aaron Williamson confirmed there was no history of any emergency calls to the home in the recent past.

Let me get this straight...he texted a picture of his dead mother to his 12 year old girlfriend, then spent the day with her?  WHAT?  Did the girl think it was a joke?  What is wrong with people?

Time to wake up!

Spunja- I also have some guns and they are locked away at all times. They are hunting guns and different ones are used for different animals. Not all guns are for protection.  I do eat the venison mainly due to who knows what cows have been feed starting with grouth hormones, antibiotics, etc.  I was given my first gun at 14 after completing my hunter safety course and still have it along with my dads collection. He and I shot targets many times and I miss those days with him. I hope I do not need to give up his guns. None are assult weapons and will never be!

I am a gun owner, and a staunch believer in the 2nd Amendment. But why the hell don't people who own firearms secure them so kids can't get their hands on them? If you can afford an AR15 and other guns, then buy a gun safe. You can get a decent safe for well under a thousand bucks, it doesn't have to be some giant thing with half inch thick walls. Most of the smaller one's can be bolted to the floor, so a thief can't just haul the whole thing away. And there are great small lock boxes made for handguns too, which you can access in seconds if you need to defend home and hearth. Those can be bolted to a table, nightstand, or the floor too. Both the CT school shooting and this NM shooting would not have happened if the parent's guns would have been locked up as I described.

"Instead, 15-year-old Nehemiah Griego texted a picture of his dead mother to his 12-year-old girlfriend, then spent much of Saturday with the girl, they said." - She may have saved a lot of lives simply by spending time with him. Perhaps it was her interaction with this kid that brought him "down" from his bloodlust and kept him from killing more people.

We need to start putting consequences to actions.....independent of age. this kid needs to be put away for life without parole.....or death penalty if the state allows it. Again, comes back to my thoughts after the Ct shooting. Stricter laws for commiting a crime with a gun....independent of age.

Our Teens have lost touch with reality. Just like movie stars and politicians.

For the people who are saying he kid needed parenting, or he was on prescription meds, we don't know that.  Maybe he was just a jerk.  Certainly the parents of the 12 year old are lax in their duties if a 12 year old can calmly look a a picture of a dead woman and go to church

What is with the 12 year old? The cops desperatly need to talk with her to see why she failed to call them, and why she went and spent a day with him AFTER she saw the pictures of his dead parents. This girl is in need of some type of help  - did her parents know she had a "boyfrind" at this age? I am very curious to WHY she spent a day with him after viewing the dead photos.

It's hard to come up with a simple explanation over all the recent shootings. But, one thing is parenting. Many of todays parents want to be their childrens "best buddies" and don't have control over their kids. My dad had guns when I was growing up and I knew where they were and could have taken them. But, I knew they weren't toys and that I would get the tar beat out of me if I touched them.  My dad had taken me shooting a couple of times and hunting a couple of times.  I even got a shotgun for Christmas when I was 12 years old.  Who knows what was going through this kids warped mind. Perhaps he thought it would be "cool" to go out in a blaze of glory. Perhaps it's because insted of teaching "the golden rule" to kids, we teach them to be selfish. It's all about me and the heck with everyone else. Manners and courtesy used to be respected. Now, being "bad" or rude is cool. Perhaps our moral degradation has come back to bite us in the butt. The chickens have come home to roost.

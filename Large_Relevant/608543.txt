CINCINNATI (AP) -- An Ohio woman who says she was fired after missing three months of work during treatment for breast cancer has sued her former employer and its managing partner, accusing them of discriminating against her and violating federal law.
                  
Jeanine Gaver of Waynesville, about 35 miles northeast of Cincinnati, accuses Digestive Specialists and her supervisor, Dr. Ramesh Gandhi, of violating the Family and Medical Leave Act by denying her the same job or its equivalent after she missed work during her treatment, which included the removal of both breasts.
                  
Gaver, 58, said Digestive Specialists took her off health insurance and offered her a job with fewer hours when she got well enough to work after the double mastectomy, saying they had found someone else for her job. Eventually, Gaver said, she was fired.
                  
Digestive Specialists, Gandhi and their attorney did not immediately return calls for comment Wednesday.
                  
Gandhi left Digestive Specialists and is involved in separate litigation with the Kettering company; he's now working as a gastroenterologist at Miami Valley Hospital in Centerville. They have not yet responded to the lawsuit, and no trial date has been scheduled.
                  
Gaver's lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Dayton, is seeking about $1.7 million for lost wages, and pain and suffering.
                  
The lawsuit says Digestive Specialist's and Gandhi's "discriminatory and irrational conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to go beyond all bounds of decency and must be considered utterly intolerable in a civilized community."
                  
Gaver "suffered severe mental and physical anguish that no reasonable person could be expected to endure," the lawsuit said.
                  
Gaver had worked at Digestive Specialists as its radiology manager for 3½ years when her yearly mammogram revealed in June 2011 that she had an aggressive breast cancer.
                  
She was approved for three months of medical leave, worked up until four days before her surgery and continually asked supervisors whether anyone needed to be trained to cover her job while she was gone, according to the lawsuit.
                  
The lawsuit says no one responded until the day before her surgery on Aug. 8, 2011, when Gandhi called her eight times, "becoming increasingly angry, harassing and intimidating with each phone call and demanding that Gaver come in to the office to train her temporary replacement."
                  
She did not go in, citing conditions of her medical leave that prohibited her from working.
                  
About a month after her surgery, the lawsuit says, Gandhi violated federal privacy laws by sending an email to everyone at the office complaining that some employees were using too much health insurance and saying that would raise the company's premiums significantly. Attached to the email was an insurance company's confidential report about Gaver's breast cancer, showing she had used about $83,500 in benefits, the lawsuit said.
                  
When Gaver was ready to return to work in October 2011, she was told her position was no longer available but that she could return in a subordinate position for a few days a week and without health insurance, the lawsuit said.
                  
At the time, the suit said, Gaver didn't know that under the Family and Medical Leave Act, employers are required to return workers to their same or an equivalent position after their medical leave is over.
                  
Worried about not having health insurance, Gaver asked whether she could get unemployment benefits if she was laid off.
                  
Soon after that, Gaver said, she was fired.
                  
While Digestive Specialist's attorney did not return a call for comment, Gaver's Dayton attorney, Jill Mead, said the company's position is that Gaver was not fired.
                  
Gaver told The Associated Press this week that she is doing well physically but that the situation has taken a financial toll.
                  
She said she gets about $1,000 a month in unemployment benefits, which goes toward paying for health insurance. She has been unable to find another job.
                  
"I'm about to lose everything," she said, adding that she hopes others learn from her case. "I really didn't know what rights I had."

The Affordable Care Act allows health insurers to charge smokers buying an individual policy up to 50 percent higher premiums starting next Jan. 1. For a 55-year-old smoker, the penalty could reach nearly $4,250 a year. A 60-year-old could wind up paying nearly $5,100 on top of premiums.

Brewer had been a leading opponent of the overhaul, and her decision got widespread attention. Budget documents cited the immigration glitch as one of her reasons.

This is so unbelieveably cheap and crummy of the employer.  I hope she not only wins but receives a hefty punitive damages award as well.  I can't imagine the stress that being worried about her job or health benefits had on her recovery.  It is really inhumane.

Interesting that these were doctors doing this.  I know, cancer keeps doctors in business.... but it's a multiple violation of this woman's rights - this is not like it was a planned disease - she had to have that surgery and then revealing her medical costs - those f'ers should lose their medical licenses!

Until you have heard the words " you have cancer" come out of your doctor's mouth you will never be able to comprehend what this woman has been through. To make her private medical information public knowledge and make harrassing phone calls to her demanding she come to work while she still had drainage tubes hanging out of her chest is a legal issue. Good luck, you are standing up for the 250,000 women who are living with breast cancer. Before you think to yourselves this will not happen to me, just know that 1 in 6 women will be diagnsed. This means you, your sister, your mom, your daughter, anut or your niece, are highly likey to have it. Breast cancer happens to men too. In fact the latest stats say that 1 in 2 people will be diagnosed with some type of cancer.

i went through a something similar.  the company agreed in writing that i could take two weeks beyond the 12 that FMLA provides (i had two weeks of vacation coming) and then laid me off a week later, stating my job was eliminated, and backdated the letter to the previous week.  not only were employees directed to email me at home when i first went on FMLA, it didn't stop until i complainted to HR.  talked to 5 or 6 attorneys but none would take the case.  they didn't think they could make enough money from the case.

Similiar thing happened to my friend's step-dad. His employer, Anadarko who is a filthy stinking rich oil and gas company, slowly started ousting him while he was fighting cancer then they cancelled his benefits and so when he died his widow was left to pay off all of the medical bills and funeral expenses. He was higher up on the corporate ladder and had been there for a long time but it didn't matter. Money is more important than people 9 times out of 10 when it comes to a business.

Good for her!  I hope she wins a huge settlement!  It is about time employers start learning how to show some empathy instead of just working a person to death!

MEXICO CITY—Rescuers pulled six more bodies from the rubble Friday at the headquarters of Mexican state oil firm Petróleos Mexicanos, as the death toll rose to 33 in the deadliest incident at the company in two decades.

Soldiers, Federal policemen and firefighters remove debris looking for victims in the headquarters of state-owned Mexican oil giant Pemex in Mexico City Friday.
Company officials said early indications suggested the explosion Thursday was the result of an accident and not an attack or sabotage, raising fresh concerns about the safety record of one of the world's largest oil firms.

WSJ's David Luhnow Reports From Scene of Pemex Explosion


"It seems like, from what experts can observe, is that it was an accident," Pemex Director-General Emilio Lozoya told the Televisa network. Mr. Lozoya pledged a full investigation. 
Mexicans were shocked by the tragedy given that it took place at the headquarters of the country's biggest company and a symbol of Mexican nationalism.
The incident comes just months before President Enrique Peña Nieto is expected to propose changes that could end the company's monopoly on oil exploration, allowing private firms to partner with the state firm for the first time. 
Like other presidents before him, he has been forced in recent weeks to reassure Mexicans that he has no plans to privatize the company itself.

Marriage of Oil and Nationalism Shaped Pemex



Pemex, which had 2011 sales of $111 billion, has seen its oil output fall to 2.55 million barrels a day from a peak of 3.4 million in 2004, and the firm is widely seen as overstaffed, riddled with corruption, and lacking in technological know-how needed to find and exploit new oil deposits in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 
While accidents at oil installations are fairly common, the incident at an administrative building is an embarrassment that could underscore the firm's need to modernize. 
"This tells you that Pemex needs to change," said Alberto Islas, a security expert in Mexico City. Already, analysts and others were calling for Pemex to make major changes in how it handles safety. 
"The explosion is a reflection of Pemex's aging infrastructure and lacking safety protocols," said Alejandro Schtulmann, an analyst with political consultancy Empra. 

Timeline of Accidents   

June 1979 – A blowout at the Ixtoc I well leads to a spill of early 3 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.
April 1992 – A buildup of gasoline from a leaky pipeline caused an explosion in Mexico's second city of Guadalajara, killing 252 people. 
July 1996 – An explosion at a Pemex chemical complex kills six. 
Oct. 2007 – A drilling platform hits an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 22 Pemex workers.
Sept. 2010 – An explosion and at the Cadereyta refinery in northern Mexico kills two workers and leaves half a dozen badly burned. 
Dec. 2010 – A crude-oil pipeline ruptures near the central Mexican town of San Martin Texmelucán, killing 30 people and damaging dozens of homes.
Sept. 2012 – An explosion at a Pemex natural-gas plant near the northern border city of Reynosa kills 30 workers. Jan. 2013 – An explosion rips through an administrative building at Pemex's headquarters, killing at least 33 workers. 
Pemex's headquarters lies in a dense neighborhood surrounded by hundreds of illegal street businesses, some of them owned by Pemex personnel, Mr. Schtulmann said. "Like most informal business in Mexico, many of these street shops rely on illegal connections to the local power grids as well as water and gas lines," he said.
The majority of the dead were women who worked in the building in administrative jobs like payroll, Pemex officials said. One or two died Friday from their injuries. Some 52 other people remained hospitalized Friday due to the explosion, which the company said hadn't affected its oil operations. 
Mr. Peña Nieto, from the country's centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party, visited with Pemex employees injured by the explosion. "I offer my deepest sympathy and solidarity to the families," he told reporters. 
Marines, federal police, Red Cross workers and Pemex employees all pitched in to help remove the rubble to see if they could find anyone else still trapped in a basement floor where the ceiling had collapsed. Workers tossed computers, keyboards, desks, file cabinets and other office equipment into the rubble amid clouds of dust.

Mexican officials could find no sign of a fire or burn marks from the blast, with paper and other flammable items intact, Mexican Attorney General Jesús Murrillo told a news conference. 
By the afternoon, rescue officials called off the search, saying their dogs were no longer picking up scents that would indicate other bodies in the rubble. 
"We brought the dogs in again to where there were concerns [there might be more people trapped] and found absolutely nothing," said Isaac Oxenhaut, rescue coordinator of Mexico's Red Cross. 
"Today unfortunately we have not found anyone alive," added Marco Antonio Franco Hernandez, another Red Cross rescue official. "The last survivor we pulled out was yesterday, and at 4 a.m. the last six people we pulled out were dead," he said Friday.
Family members went to city morgues to claim the dead. "When we heard about it on television, we got worried. We finally got the bad news at 2 a.m.," said Adolfo Garcia, whose nephew Daniel worked at the building. 
Just two hours before the blast at Pemex headquarters, the company touted its security record, saying it has reduced its number of accidents in recent years to international levels. 
Most of the people who have died over a number of decades in Pemex accidents have been contract workers or others killed by fuel leaks and gas explosions—victims that aren't counted as workers for the purposes of reporting industrial accident rates, said George Baker, who runs a Houston energy consulting firm.

Rescue workers move debris at the scene of the blast Friday.
In September, a massive explosion at a Pemex natural-gas plant near the northern border city of Reynosa killed 30 workers and caused critical shortages of the fuel. 
Thursday's explosion marked the biggest tragedy to hit the firm since a 1992 leak at a gasoline pipeline in Mexico's second city of Guadalajara destroyed several city blocks and killed 252 people. 
Mr. Islas, the security expert, said one of Pemex's main challenges is to battle corruption in giving out contracts for everything from drilling to industrial safety. "This latest blast shows the results of a systematic lack of oversight in contracts at Pemex that the company relies on for everything, including industrial security."
Just days before the blast, Mexico's lower house of congress said it would put together a working group of lawmakers to investigate corruption in Pemex's contracts. On Friday, the congress held a minute of silence for the victims and Mexico City's government declared three days of mourning.

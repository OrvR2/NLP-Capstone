NEWTOWN, Conn. (AP) — Newtown residents are divided on what to do with the school building where 26 people were killed, with some favoring demolition and construction of a memorial and others encouraging renovations.
Many passionately gave their opinions at an emotional public meeting Sunday about the fate of Sandy Hook Elementary.
"I have two children who had everything taken from them," said Audrey Bart, whose children attend the school but weren't injured in the shooting. "The Sandy Hook Elementary School is their school. It is not the world's school. It is not Newtown's school. We cannot pretend it never happened, but I am not prepared to ask my children to run and hide. You can't take away their school."
But fellow Sandy Hook parent Stephanie Carson said she can't imagine ever sending her son back to the building.
"I know there are children who were there who want to go back," Carson said. "But the reality is, I've been to the new school where the kids are now, and we have to be so careful just walking through the halls. They are still so scared."
The meeting at Newtown High School drew about 200 people. A second meeting is set for Friday. Town officials also are planning private meetings with the victims' families to get their input.
Police say Adam Lanza, 20, killed 20 first-graders and six adults in the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook. They say he killed his mother at the home they shared in Newtown before opening fire with a semiautomatic rifle at the school and killing himself as police arrived.
Although opinions were mixed at the Sunday meeting, most agreed that the Sandy Hook children and teachers should stay together. They've been moved to a school building about seven miles away in a neighboring town that has been renamed Sandy Hook Elementary School.
Mergim Bajraliu, a senior at Newtown High School, attended Sandy Hook, and his sister is a fourth-grader there. He said the school should stay as it is, and a memorial for the victims should be built there.
"We have our best childhood memories at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and I don't believe that one psychopath — who I refuse to name — should get away with taking away any more than he did on Dec 14," he said.
Last week, residents around town expressed similar opinions about the school's future.
"I'm very torn," said Laurie Badick, of Newtown, whose children attended the school several years ago. "Sandy Hook school meant the world to us before this happened. ... I have my memories in my brain and in my heart, so the actual building, I think the victims need to decide what to do with that."
Susan Gibney, who lives in Sandy Hook, said she purposely doesn't drive by the school because it's too disturbing. She has three children in high school, but they didn't attend Sandy Hook Elementary School. She believes the building should be torn down.
"I wouldn't want to have to send my kids back to that school," said Gibney, 50. "I just don't see how the kids could get over what happened there."
Fran Bresson, a retired police officer who attended Sandy Hook Elementary School in the 1950s, wants the school to reopen, but he thinks the hallways and classrooms where staff and students were killed should be demolished.
"To tear it down completely would be like saying to evil, 'You've won,'" the 63-year-old Southbury resident said.
Residents of towns where mass shootings occurred have grappled with the same dilemma. Some have renovated, some have demolished.
Columbine High School, where two student gunmen killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher, reopened several months afterward. Crews removed the library, where most of the victims died, and replaced it with an atrium.
On an island in Norway where 69 people — more than half of them teenagers attending summer camp — were killed by a gunman in 2011, extensive remodeling is planned. The main building, a cafeteria where 13 of the victims died, will be torn down.
Virginia Tech converted a classroom building where a student gunman killed 30 people in 2007 into a peace studies and violence prevention center.
An Amish community in Pennsylvania tore down the West Nickel Mines Amish School and built a new school a few hundred yards away after a gunman killed five girls there in 2006.
Newtown First Selectwoman E. Patricia Llodra said that in addition to the community meetings, the town is planning private gatherings with the victims' families to talk about the school's future. She said the aim is to finalize a plan by March.
"I think we have to start that conversation now," Llodra said. "It will take many, many months to do any kind of school project. We have very big decisions ahead of us. The goal is to bring our students home as soon as we can."

Is it like being thrown from a horse?

The best way to get rid of the bad memories is to replace them with good memories. Things that affected me emmotionally in a negative sense can be healed with the passage of time. Parents deal with their children's traumas all the time. As toddlers, they fall down and start crying like they were going to die. Experienced parents pick them up and provide a diversion. If, on the other hand, the parent makes a big deal out of it, it gains momentum. Whether we like it or not, everyone experiences some bad times in their life--and yes, what happened is especially terrible--but is this not a time to provide support and nurturing to help learn to deal with those things, rather than encouraging them to run away and not deal with them. Children can be amazingly resilient, or they can take their cues from their parents and become emotional cripples. 

It should not be a sink or swim situation, but it should be handled. An only-child friend of mine encountered some rough road, and committed suicide. His parents were wonderful people, but they shielded him, even as an adult. There is truth to the adage that "What doesn't kill me makes me stronger."

A wise friend once observed that one of the failings of our school system is that assume everybody is going to be successful. As a result, they do nothing to equip learners to deal with failures that we all experience in our lives. Newtown did not choose this terrible experience, but they might be able to salvage some good out of it if they try.

I realize since I am not a part of Newtown my opinion doesn't really matter; but I do have a suggestion.  Since there is a perfectly good school that the children are attending now that allows the teachers and students to remain together continue with that school until the current crop of kindergarteners graduate from elementary school.  Don't ask any of those students to return to the scene of such horror.  In the meantime, use the money people have so generously donated to renovate Sandy Hook.  Make it the best elementary school around.  When the children who experienced that awful day have moved on to middle school return the staff, and the new elementary students, to Sandy Hook.  Also, build a beautiful memorial garden at the school, complete with things children care about, like merry-go-rounds, and swing sets, to honor the victims and heroes of that tragic day.

RENOVATE it.  Give it a new name, a new look.  The kids will adjust--just as they did at Virginia Tech, Columbine...being TOGETHER heals.

While most 'outsiders', people not directly effected by a tragedy of this magnitude, rightfully deeply sympathize with the initial happenings, we seldom think of the necessary recovery steps. My continued thoughts and prayers are with all those in this community as they seek to move forward.

Newtown will always be in the news and compared to past and future similar tragedies. They will always be reminded of what happened.

What a dump

I wonder how the kids feel?  Maybe someone should ask them, gently, how they feel about ever going back into that building?

Good luck on coming to your decision. I have an opinion but I don't live there so I won't say it.

It's up to the school district and the parents on what they want to do.
My prayers are still with you.

My wife broke a piece of her favorite China. She loved it so much that she now wants to throw the rest of it away. I hate to say it, but some of these parents should probably send their kids to another school. But to discard a school? Those people are too emotional to make a rational decision.

BOSTON (AP) — Since his suicide, friends and admirers have cast free-information activist Aaron Swartz as a martyred hero hounded to his death by the government he antagonized. One newspaper columnist — whose piece on Swartz was accompanied by a photo showing him at his computer, his head encircled by a golden halo — even compared him to an Internet-age Martin Luther King Jr.
But those closest to the 26-year-old Swartz say the hacker prodigy wasn't out to be a hero. Rather, he was a painfully shy young man who felt passionately that government and big business had hijacked the Web and hoped to make a difference.
In the end, they say, Swartz failed to fully appreciate the threat he embodied to some.
"It was an act of personal risk," said James Grimmelmann, a professor at New York Law School who had known Swartz for six years. "I don't think he understood just how much the system would come down on him over it."
Swartz, a wunderkind who helped create Reddit and RSS, the technology behind blogs, podcasts and other Web-based subscription services, was found dead Friday in his New York apartment.
Swartz's friends and family blame federal prosecutors for his suicide, saying they pursued him relentlessly in the years since he helped post millions of federal court documents for free online rather than the few cents per page charged by the government through its electronic archive. He was never indicted. But three years later, he was charged in Boston with using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's computer network to download nearly 5 million academic articles from an online clearinghouse for scholarly journals.
His lawyer, Elliot Peters, said prosecutors were insisting he plead guilty to all 13 felony charges and serve four to six months in prison or go to trial and face up to 35 years. Swartz rejected that offer, saying he didn't want to be branded a felon.
Since his death, his family, friends and supporters have unleashed a torrent of anger online: a petition calling on President Barack Obama to fire the federal prosecutor who charged him, a flood of copyrighted academic papers put online for anyone to see and a flurry of furious rants on Twitter. Though even some of his supporters say they believe Swartz broke the law, they say the penalties for a crime they equate with trespassing are inordinately harsh.
This much is certain, though: Regardless of how he may have viewed himself, in death Swartz has become the face of a raging debate over how hard the government treats electronic protests in the Internet age.
U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz on Wednesday extended her "heartfelt sympathy" to Swartz's loved ones but continued to defend the charges against him and said her office had acted properly. She said she understood there was anger felt by people who believe her office's prosecution of Swartz was unwarranted and was tied to his suicide.
"I must, however, make clear that this office's conduct was appropriate in bringing and handling this case," Ortiz said in an emailed statement. "The career prosecutors handling this matter took on the difficult task of enforcing a law they had taken an oath to uphold, and did so reasonably."
Ortiz had said earlier that "stealing is stealing, whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars" and that the victim is harmed "whether you sell what you have stolen or give it away." But she insisted her office never sought maximum penalties in Swartz's case and never told his attorneys it intended to.
Robert Swartz, who said at his son's funeral that he was "killed by the government," said in a later interview that his son occasionally got depressed but was never diagnosed with clinical depression and never took medication for it. The suicide, he said, was "due to the fact that he was put under relentless, incredible pressure."
Whether Swartz broke the law or not, many supporters see him as their protagonist, a modern-day leader of the "free culture" movement to make information available on the Internet at no charge.
"This crime had no victims. He wasn't ever intending to profit in ANY way, not one penny," said Glenn Greenwald, a columnist for the British newspaper The Guardian who had communicated with Swartz online over the years. "It was really just a political act to protest a system in pursuit of a noble cause. ... I mean, the idea that he needs to be locked up in a prison as a menace to society is just obscene."
Greenwald called Swartz "heroic" and even compared him to King, the late civil rights leader.
"I think when you engage in civil disobedience, you make a calculation about the price that you're likely to have to pay," Greenwald, a former litigator, said in a telephone interview from his home in Brazil.
Some kind of punishment "is an important part of the social process," he acknowledged — but not as much as Swartz faced.
Journalist Juan Williams, the author of several books on the civil rights movement, said the comparison with King only goes so far.
"I think that Mr. Swartz IS a King-like figure for this generation in the sense that he was willing to challenge what he viewed as unjust laws," Williams said. "Where the analogy breaks down for me is that ... (Swartz) did not understand that in taking up this fight and bearing THIS cross, he was going to expose himself to tremendous political and emotional cost."
Swartz's family said he never thought of himself that way and may have cringed at such comparisons. His girlfriend, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, would disagree with the characterization of what he was trying to do in the case of the online academic clearinghouse, known as JSTOR.
"I don't think that Aaron believed he committed any crime," she said. "I think Aaron would have under some circumstances engaged in civil disobedience, but this wasn't one of those cases."
Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, who had known and admired Swartz for more than a decade, agreed with Swartz's father.
"He was impatient to achieve something," said Lessig, faculty director of Harvard's Safra Center for Ethics, where Swartz was once a fellow.
Lessig said he was confident that Swartz was "surprised by the extremeness of their characterization of what happened" in the JSTOR case.
"So, unlike Martin Luther King, who might have been marching into Bull Connor's dogs, I don't think everything here was completely obvious," Lessig said. "But I'm sure he understood here that he was undertaking a significant risk."
Joel Tenenbaum, a former Boston University student who was sued by the Recording Industry Association of America and ordered to pay $675,0000 for illegally downloading and sharing songs on the Internet, says he empathized with Swartz.
"If you double-park your car, the worst you expect is to have your car towed and have to pay a couple of hundred dollars," he said. "You don't expect to lose your car over it. You don't expect to be put in prison for it."
Lessig said Swartz couldn't conceive of why the government would consider him enough of a threat to warrant special attention. And his failure to appreciate his symbolic value, Lessig said, "might have led him to be more reckless than he otherwise would have been."
"His naivete was a vice," Lessig said. "But it was a vice of the best possible kind."
"I think he would be completely astonished ... at the action that his death has provoked," Lessig said. "And I certainly think a deeper appreciation of the love of the Net for him would have made it harder for him to take the ultimate step that he did."

I am sick and tired of the "boys will be boys, let's give them a stern warning and let them go", or (as in this case) "he had good intentions, so it didn't matter if he broke the law" mentality when it comes to computer crimes. If law enforcement is to be blamed at all, it is for the past leniency that has led the current generation to think that whatever they want to do with anybody else's information and anybody else's infrastructure is OK, and their actions will be free from consequence.

Swartz was, in his own way, a petty little tyrant who, disagreeing with the law, disagreeing with how the content providers operated, violated the security of the university network and the proprietary interest of the content providers. He had no regard for the wishes of the copyright holders, some of whom may very well have wanted the information to be free, some of whom may have profoundly disagreed with his unauthorized distribution of their product. Nor is it just the authors of these articles that have an interest. Peer-reviewed journal articles are, as the name suggests, reviewed by qualified professionals prior to publication. There is a considerable investment of resources in the publication of these materials.

If a teenager broke into your house, #$%$ all over your couch and made himself a sandwich, I very much doubt that you would thank him for demonstrating that you had an inadequate lock on your front door. That is exactly what many would have us do with Swartz and groups like anonymous.

It is unfortunate that he chose to kill himself. I think it's doubtful that he would have gotten much jail time, or anything like a million dollar fine. He would have been a convicted felon, and quite frankly, deserved to be. If Robin Hood were caught by any U.S. sheriff (instead of the sheriff of Nottingham) he would similarly find himself facing a felony conviction.

His troubles stem not from overzealous prosecution, but from his own decision to commit a crime, because he decided he just didn't like the way things were being done.

"I don't think that Aaron believed he committed any crime," 
Therein lies the problem.
'Free' does not necessarily equal 'just'. Equating him with MLK is perverse, except in that his generation has grown up to believe everything is now free - if you can get it that way.  So, if he was a big part in that, I guess he could be the King of thieves.

I like the double parking your car analogy. If you do it once you can get a ticket, but keep doing it and you will lose your car

Always above the law.  Then, when things go wrong, blame someone else for whatever happens.
Endemic of the times and people across the US.  Accept responsibility for your own damn actions!

What's the diff between hacking into someone's files and breaking into their house??  A thief is a thief.  Doesn't make any difference that some folks think it's cool or cute, it's still illegal.

To many who may see suicide as the "ONLY WAY OUT" let them know that it is "NOT" there are always other answers and it is the most selfish act which one can do. Their survivors are always left alone and wondering, WHY? and the unanswered questions will always remain so.

I don't drive faster than 70 when the speed limit is 70. I come to a complete stop at stop signs. I quit smoking rather than to risk the chance I inadvertently was smoking within 50 feet of an entrance way. I skip taking a deduction if the IRS may question it. I pay a ridiculous price for health insurance Obama told me to get, even though I never use it. My kids got every government mandated vaccine. I don't remove the tag on mattresses or pillows even though there is a loophole to do so by the final consumer. I never know when someone may consume it after me. I got rid of all my incandescent light bulbs. When they tell me I'm too old and must enter that large, totally enclosed room with large gas pipes, I'll go. Why would I change then?

The pressure and stress that the government can put on a person many times can be to much for some people and they simply find the easy way out. Accomplishing nothing but grieve and heartache for those left behind.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Almost four decades after he was arrested and tortured and his sister disappeared into a maze of Philippine police cells and military houses, playwright Bonifacio Ilagan is finally seeing his suffering officially recognized.
A writer for an underground communist newspaper, Ilagan and thousands like him were rounded up by dictator Ferdinand Marcos' security forces after he placed the Philippines under martial law in 1972. Detentions, beatings, harassment and killings of the regime's opponents continued until Marcos was toppled in 1986.
Even though democracy was restored, it would take another 27 years for the Philippine Congress to vote on a bill awarding compensation and recognition to martial law victims. The bill was ratified Monday and will be sent to Pres. Benigno Aquino III for signing into law, said Sen. Francis Escudero, a key proponent.
"More than the monetary compensation, the bill represents the only formal, written document that martial law violated the human rights of Filipinos and that there were courageous people who fought the dictatorship," said a statement from SELDA, an organization of former political prisoners that campaigned for the passage of the bill.
Ilagan's story is more of a rule than exception among leftist activists of his generation.
"The torture started in the house. We were beaten up, punched and kicked," he said, recalling a police raid on his residence in April 1974 and the beginning of his two-year detention ordeal.  He said he vomited blood after being kicked in the thighs and had the soles of his foot burned by an iron.
"The one episode in my torture that I cannot forget was when they ordered me to remove my pants and underwear and they inserted a piece of stick into my penis. 'Oh my God,' I said, this is one torture I could not bear,'" the 61-year-old said in an interview. He said that interrogators wanted him to decode documents and identify people in pictures that were seized from suspected communist activists.
"Compared to others, mine was not the worst torture," he said. "The others were electrocuted and injected with truth serum. ... But the threats continued."
Ilagan's sister, Rizalina, disappeared in 1976 along with nine other activists, many of them students involved in anti-Marcos publications, he said. One of the women arrested by the same government unit that he suspected was involved in his sister's abduction had escaped to recount her rape and torture. Ilagan said he has no doubt that his sister went through the same abuses.
His parents died still hoping his sister would turn up alive, but the family has found no closure, Ilagan said.
Lawmakers in two chambers of the Congress agreed last week on the text of the compensation bill.
Aquino is the son of an assassinated anti-Marcos activist and a mother who led the 1986 "people power" revolt that ousted Marcos and sent him into U.S. exile, where he died three years later without ever facing prosecution for human rights abuses.
Many of Marcos' men reinvented themselves as powerful politicians or businessmen, and not one was successfully prosecuted for any of the crimes allegedly committed during the martial law years.
Two martial law figures, former Defense Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile and the deputy military chief of staff, Fidel Ramos, led a mutiny against Marcos as part of the 1986 revolt. Ramos later served as president from 1992 to 1998, and Enrile is currently the president of the Senate.
Despite cases filed by former political prisoners, "there have been no convictions of perpetrators," Marie Hilao-Enriquez, chairwoman of SELDA, said Monday.
The Marcos family, meanwhile, returned from exile in 1990s and again wields influence. Former first lady Imelda Marcos is a lawmaker, son Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcosis is a senator, and daughter Imee is a provincial governor.
"Governments after Marcos did not move or did not do anything to go after Marcos seriously, so we filed a case in Hawaii," Hilao-Enriquez said.
In 1992, victims won a class action suit against the Marcos estate in Hawaii.
Under the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act of 2013, the 9,539 victims will be awarded compensation using $246 million that the Philippine government recovered from Marcos' ill-gotten wealth. But all claims will have to evaluated by an independent commission and the amount each will receive will depend of the abuse suffered.
"Finally, over two decades after the fall of the dictatorship, we will have a law that puts the responsibility of human rights abuses square on the shoulder of Marcos and provides justice for all those who suffered under his reign," said Rep. Walden Bello, a member of a congressional committee that drafted and approved the bill.

Enrile was the author of all that happened, and now the blustering old fool still thinks he is in charge of the Philippines. Even though he pays off those around him,he will die someday and will have to face God. GOD doesn't forget.

"$246 million that the Philippine government recovered from Marcos' ill-gotten wealth".  That is only a small fraction of the money Marcos stole.  Imelda has bragged that her net worth is over $10 Billion.

Even with the passage of the Compensation Bill, current president Aquino has already allied the Marcoses (his father's jailer), into his camp for the May elections. Politcs is addition. Aquino, instead of putting the dictator's family of thieves into jail, has put former president Gloria Arroyo in jail, just because the Aquino family could not topple her, unlike what they did to Marcos and Estrada.

Very few people know that Ferdinand Marcos was a convicted murderer at age 18. He cold bloodily killed (with a shotgun) his father's opponent (Nalundasan) at arm's length after he defeated his father. Nalundasan had clearly won the election for the National Assembly seat for Ilocos Norte. Murder of  Nalundasan was an eye witness account and there was no doubt that 18 years old Marcos killed him.  

The story goes like this:

On September 20, 1935, the day after Nalundasan defeated Mariano Marcos (the father of Ferdinand Marcos) , Nalundasan was shot and killed in his house in Batac. According to two witnesses, Ferdinand Marcos had assassinate Nalundasan at arm length. In late January 1939, he was denied bail and in the fall of 1939 he was convicted. Ferdinand received the death penalty for premeditated murder. The Marcos family took their appeal to the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which on October 22, 1940, overturned the lower court's decision and acquitted him of all charges. 

Money and influence pays off in the Philippines. It is only in the Philippines where a convicted murderer not only gets away with murder he can also become President. And then he gets the green light to murder hundreds of thousands of innocent people for the next 20 years.

All Marcos dynasty has the wealth of their father. They should be all indited, their wealth confiscated and given to the victims.

And I agree, none of them deserve public office. If any dynasty's has a convicted criminal like Marcos, his family should be out of the public service permanently.

Where is Mrs. Marcos and her children now? Still in the Philippines holding senior public offices? I am a shoe freak.  If I go to that country, I would like to see her shoe collection. I hope they are all preserved and housed a national museum in Manila!

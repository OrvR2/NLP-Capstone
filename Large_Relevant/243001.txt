WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heart disease and diabetes get all the attention, but what about the many other ways obesity can damage your health?
                  
Carrying too many pounds may lead to or worsen some types of cancer, arthritis, sleep apnea, even infertility. But a new poll suggests few Americans realize the links.
                  
Only about one-quarter of people think it's possible for someone to be very overweight and still healthy, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
                  
Ask about the most serious consequences, and more than 7 in 10 Americans can correctly tick off heart disease and diabetes. Heart disease is the nation's leading killer, and diabetes and obesity are twin epidemics, as rates of both have climbed in recent years.
                  
The other consequences aren't so well known.
                  
"People are often shocked to hear how far-reaching the effects of obesity are," said Jennifer Dimitriou, a bariatric dietitian at New York's Montefiore Medical Center.
                  
Only 7 percent of people surveyed mentioned cancer, although doctors long have known that fat increases the risk of developing cancers of the colon, breast, prostate, uterus and certain other sites. Plus, being overweight can make it harder to spot tumors early and to treat them.
                  
Then there's the toll on your joints, especially the knees. About 15 percent of people knew obesity can contribute to arthritis, a vicious cycle as the joint pain then makes it harder to exercise and shed pounds.
                  
High blood pressure, high cholesterol and strokes were fairly low on the list. Infertility didn't get a mention.
                  
Also, 5 percent put respiratory problems on the list. Studies show people who are overweight are at increased risk of sleep apnea and asthma, and that dropping pounds can help improve their symptoms.
                  
Knowing more about the myriad ways obesity affects health could help motivate people to get more active and eat better before full-blown disease strikes, Dimitriou said.
                  
"Most people want to become healthier. It's the know-how, and understanding what the consequences are," she said.
                  
But only 52 percent of those surveyed said they've discussed the health risks of being overweight with a doctor.
                  
In another complication, the AP-NORC Center survey found that about half of people think their weight is just about right, and only 12 percent of parents think their child is overweight. That's even though government figures show two-thirds of U.S. adults, and one-third of children and teens, are either overweight or obese.
                  
If you're surrounded by overweight people, especially in your family, "then that's all you know, and that to you is normal," Dimitriou said.
                  
The AP-NORC Center survey was conducted Nov. 21 through Dec. 14. It involved landline and cellphone interviews with 1,011 adults nationwide and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.

I was 40 lbs over what I weighed when I was in the best physical condition of my life at 35 - 45.  Then, at 62 my wife got worried because my older brother died from heart problems made worse by the fact that he was 50 lbs overweight, and then my younger brother had to have a stint put in.  She did an enormous amount of research on nutrition, and I agreed to adhere to the diet she put us on.  I lost 35 lbs in the last 4 months mostly by changing my diet, and increasing my exercise.  I didn't starve myself, as a matter of fact I ate more than before, but I just changed WHAT I ate.  That, with increasing my physical activity by about 15% is what helped me lose.  I can't tell you the difference losing that weight has made in my life, I feel like I lost 20 years as well.  I'll be 63 in a couple of weeks and I feel GREAT.

Yes, you could say that I now have somewhere to lay my arms. Ha!  Okay, I'm not that bad, really.  Once I started to notice the poundage creep, I went vegetarian, and I have never felt better.  4 hours sleep a night - and always mentally sharp as a tack; no health problems, no illnesses; huge savings on my food bill; Jr (yep, the little brain) wakes up before me again almost every morning, just like it was back in high school - glad to know he's still alive and well; look 10 years younger; no longer have that unhealthy slight pale look, even with a tan; eyes are whiter; my clothes always fit, and on and on and on.  Even my aura of health draws women to me.  I remember walking down the beach (or anywhere for that matter) and not really getting noticed.  Now, oh yeah! They want me. That's right, maybe not all, but some - which is a good thing.  I'm no longer a legend in my own mind.  Okay, I'm rambling...and kinda kidding about the legend in my own mind part, but the rest it true.   

Frankly, before the diet change, I looked like a retired athlete; 250 lbs of mostly fat at 5 foot 8.  Now I am back to around 150, cut and athletic, and I can bench press double my body weight.  I'm 46 now, but when I graduated high School, I was 142, cut.  

Junk food is cool when we were young; of course, we had the metabolism and activity to deal with it; but as we get older, it's time to listen to the body.  Why am I rambling?  I'm just trying to encourage you folks to regain your life as I did.  Best of luck to you all. Take care, and your significant other's will thank you for it.  Your women will no longer - choose - to walk 5 feet behind you.  She will now be proud to hold you arm in arm.  And ladies, your man will desire you like he did when you first met.  Remember that?  Well, you can have it again.

Well that's a damned lie. We have it shoved down our throats all night and day by the media. The only thing in health sections now is how to lose weight. It's too bad the government doesn't spend as much time addressing the epidemic of mass stupidity.

Not to mention the government doesn't know its butt from a hole in the ground.I've known people who were absolutely anorexic and had to be admitted to the hospital they were so bad. Terrible hair, nails, skin, you could see all their ribs, hip bones, spine,etc. And you know what? They were still 18 pounds overweight according to the government's weight standards!

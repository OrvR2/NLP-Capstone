Guns do not shoot themselves! When you can show me one get up, load itself, and fire it self let me know! There are more things out there killing people than guns like texting and driving, illnesses, drugs, etc. And we areďťż more worriend about tyis really... No one needs a 30 rd mag, but no one needs a ford f150, or hollister cloths, thats your choice and thats what makes this america freedom of choice. I agree with more background checks sure ive got nothing to hide.

The problem is social decay. Parents get divorced and dont spend time with kids. Instead they let xbox babysit their kids and buy them games they are too young toďťż play.

So it looks like republicans are trying to get more votes from young people by saying video games are bad (sarcasm). I guess the republican party has the ultimateďťż goal of alienating any and every demographic that they can.

I think if it were not for games, there would be far more people trying to play REAL life grand theft auto or take out their aggression on the house, belongings or lovedďťż one. Instead of sitting down and blowing off some steam and tuning your mind out of this world and people like this guy for a while, call me crazy.

A gun is an object, a machine, a tool, ... does a gun kill aďťż person? or does a person wielding this tool (gun) kill a person... same thing with a hammer a car a crowbar or anything else you insert into a persons hand... now freak accidents happen but you are a fool if you believe that the gun is responsible and not the person... I am all for control but Criminals love un-armed targets and that puts us in a worse situation than we were before... A gun is a tool, A Person is a Killer

Ok so I play video games... So by the logic ofďťż 90% of the American population I will end up becoming a murder... Well I guess I better get ready for my destiny then! On a more serious note however the only people that play video games and do something of that nature were mentally and emotionally compromised already and and they would more than just likely do what they're doing even if they don't play videogames.

No. But Obama supports a strict ban on ordinary hand guns.ďťż He's hostile to the Bill of Rights, including a woman's right toďťż choose a handgun for protection from male stalkers & weirdos. Obama believes women shouldn't be allowed to own hand guns.

Saying guns kill people is also foolish, that's like saying pencils misspell words, not people. If the Koreans didn't have semi auto rifles during the LA riots, they wouldďťż have easily been killed and pillaged far more than what actually happened.
And yes, the UK is talking about banning sharp kitchen knives because violent crime rose far higher after guns were banned.

Just so you know Naruto, Obama has killed 3 times as many innocent civilians as Bush. Obama uses drones to kill while Bush usedďťż people because of the lack of accuracy of drones. Obama doesnt care about the middle east and the Muslims who will end up hating us because he can shift responsibility on Bush for 'starting' the war. Obama has started more wars than Bush and Obama has troops still in Iraq despite the medias obvious butt kissing and denial that we are still there. All of this in ONE term

tell me, if you could avoid the death of some people by doing something, would you do it? or would you just give the excuse that other things cause more deaths... but those things that cause more deaths can't be really avoided, but gun deaths, you could. Still I'm not saying BAN all guns, just regulate them more strictly, because they are already there...

We need guns for protection against:
rapists, terrorists, tyrants, murderers, kidnappers, gay-bashers,ďťż lynch mob/kkk-types, robbers, stalkers, mass-shooters, violent flash mobs, rioters, extreme protestors, drug cartels and gang members...
The reason there are 300 million guns here (actually, more than 300 million) is because guns have been legal and available in America for over 240 years and our population is about 300 million.
Are we supposed to share a few thousand guns amongst ourselves?

Amend 2nd Amendment? Very unlikely.
Extreme protestors throw objects at police, light mom & pop grocery stores on fire, smash windows, flip innocent civilians' cars & light them on fire. Extreme protestors were common in the EARLY 2000s. Theyďťż trashed Seattle, way back in early 2000.
You challenged 2 of my examples. That leaves rapists, racists, terrorists, murderers, kidnappers, gay-bashers, robbers, stalkers, mass-shooters, violent flash mobs, rioters, extreme protestors, drug cartels & gangs

I totally agree with your position, Im just playing devil's advocate right now. There is a difference between guns killing someone and cars killing someone. Most of the time death by cars are from accidents and in addition cars were created to improve transportation.ďťż Death by a gun is usually intented and guns were invented mostly for killing/hunting. Your statement isn't a very good example.

I'm surprised no one's drawingďťż upon similarities to the incident that happened the same week in China, where an adult went on a rampage in school and WOUNDED 21+ children with a KNIFE. However none of them died. Why? Because China has strict gun control laws.

He's said "the 1st Amendment limits what we can do about video games, the 2nd Amendment limits what we can do about guns". Why? Democide (mass-murder by government) has been going on for thousands of years! Govts registered guns, confiscated themďťż and then murdered 250 Million stupid, helpless citizens in just the last 100 years. THAT is why guns are second only to speech!

Since guns don't people and people kill people, we need to thus remove guns from people so people are not killed more rapidly.

Let's get rid of all types of vehicles, rocks, shovels, axes, knives, wood, water (drowning),any combustible fuels bio or non, electricity, no more surgeries (over 197,000 surgery related deaths a year as opposed to 12,000 gun related deaths a year),pens, pencils, fists, feet, cloth, ban and control everything because it allďťż kills people whether rapid or not. More people died at the Battle of Cannae in 1 day (est. 80,000 Romans and Carthaginians), without guns. You're irrational and illogical.

There are flaws with your argument. Guns were invented forďťż killing people. Apart from hunting, guns have literally no other use. All the things you listed have other uses. Whilst your surgery numbers may be true (I'm not going to check), it is a definite fact that they save more lives than they end and no surgeon has ever gone into a hospital with the intent to kill their patient (other than about 5 ever)

There are many examples how guns have saved lives Home invasions etc.The largest ever school killing took place in Michigan in the 1940's with TNT.What flaws are there?Guns are made out of different materials combined. Should we ban these materials? Your argument is flawed (withďťż respect).If America got rid of its Nuclear weapons,would the rest of the world?No.That's why we have them as well. Its fear of retaliation.When people shoot up places people with guns are called.I suggest everyone carry.

I suppose that since the US already has so many guns, it would be impossible to restrict them in any meaningful way at this point, but don't you agree that it would be better if there were literally no gunsďťż instead of everybody only kept peaceable by each others constant fear of one another? Or to use your nuclear weapons analogy, which is better, peace through diplomacy or peace through M.A.D.?

Why do we have a needďťż for weapons? Because people have weapons?

It's not really a need. We need food and water. We don't need weapons. Kitchen knives are weapons. What are they going to do? Ban kitchen knives?ďťż Cars are weapons too. Maybe they'll ban cars? The second amendment is there not so that we can have guns to hunt. It is there so that when a government becomes tyrannical, we, the people have a mean to defend against the corrupted regime. Now, if our government is not corrupted, they should have no fear. It's a right, not a need.

That's what I hate about people that say "There's no need for XXXX". There's very little that a human beingďťż needs to survive, just Air, Water, Food and Shelter.

Guns are a relatively new development, historically speaking. Yet, humans have ALWAYS killed each other. Take away one weapon, they'll find or developďťż another.
Don't blame the tool, blame the person using the tool.

Guns or video games don't kill people. People kill people. How many of us play shooters and aren't murderers? 85 to 100 million gun owners in this country aren't murdering people everyday. It comes down to personal responsibility. Taking away video games or guns of any type won't stop murder. And last time I checked murder was against the law. Yet people still do it. There is no earthly Utopia and there never will be. Leave us alone andďťż stop interfering in our lives.

Funfact: Most murderers and school shooters are not inspired by games at all! The majority of murderers who were inspired toďťż kill are inspired by writing, especially THEIR OWN. Followed by TV, followed by music, followed by comics, and near the end, video games.
Most murderers aren't inspired by video games. Video games do not promote people to kill people, or force people not to kill people. It's all personal choice. Blame the people, not the form of media they were inspired from.

I've been playingďťż video games since I was young, haven't gone berserk and killed a bunch of people yet. I also have no urge to own a gun. And if that were to happen, I wouldn't be able to kill as many people if I didn't have access to an assault rifle. I'd also be more limited if I didn't have access to any firearms!
Video games entertain, stimulate, and help with hand/eye coordination. Guns have one function only, to kill. Why do we defend instruments who's only function is to end life?

So stupid. Censorship is an ugly thing, and it often leads to some form of fascism. I can't stand the way history repeats itself. First it was comic books,then rock n' roll, then dungeons and dragons, and now video games. Soon, people will be burning video games....and if you knowďťż anything about nazis, you would know that the process of limiting knowledge and creativity by burning it has an ugly history with some very ugly people.

Violent video-games release stress and reduce aggression It's called "Cathartic Violence". As an avid gamer who suffers severe chronic pain and requires stress release due to the fact that my Chronic Illness is worsened by stress I can attest playing violent video-games helps release my stress and gets out my aggression and evens out my temper. They want to blame anything except Guns and Alcohol for violenceďťż since Republican Politicians love both.

Although from black bags under my eyes and anďťż extraordinary typing speed, playing video games such as Grand Theft Auto and Medal of Honor haven't affected me what-so-ever, besides not taking life so seriously.
I advise you to not stereotype us children, teenagers and gamers, as a whole, because we are just like you.

He correctly reasons that guns never add security, they remove security.
Think: Someone living under a weapon ban wants you harm. You two exchange punches, police arrest him.
Someone living in the US wantsďťż you harm. You go for your gun because you're scared. Wait, he's already drawn his gun and he kills you.
How's the self-defense think working then?

I vote Conservative, and I feel videogames are fine. Now calling this uninformed man a "stupid old senileďťż cunt" is quite childish and wrong.

Cause apparently mentally unstable people can get their hands on guns (the true issue) but however games (the violent ones that kids cannot buy for that matter meaning the parents bought it for them) that the parents have to buy, are the issue even though there are other factors such as bullying and drugs but rememberďťż those politicians won't tell the truth unless they are paid.

When I first heard this hypothesis I thought it was logical.
A child growing up with constant violent video images would be desensitized to violence. Violent video games could lead to more violence.
Several studies have been done on the issue.
All the studies say there isďťż no connection.
The hypothesis has been proven wrong.
I believe drinking milk makes people violent. Every violent person has drunk milk.
there for it must be the milk.

It's really unfair to say "most of you" - this is one senator from one state. People from both parties have raggedďťż on video games, so it's not even a Rep vs Dem issue. I'm just glad I don't live in Tennessee.
Also, there are countries around the world with incredibly strict gaming policies - Germany and Australia come to mind.

Another politician using video games as a scapegoat for the rise in violence. When will people learn that it's not these forms of media that are the underlying cause, but rather that the people who commit these acts were messed up in their head to begin with? These politicians need to get off their high horse and do some actual research into the matterďťż before mouthing off some biased, fear-inspired B.S. to the media.

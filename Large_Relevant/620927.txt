Ron Paul Slams America’s ‘King Of The World’ Foreign Policy On Fox, Following Guest Fires Back

Appearing on Fox’s Your World this afternoon, retired Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) did not hold back about his thoughts on the “blowback” consequences from America’s “kings of the world” style of foreign policy. Host Neil Cavuto appeared to have reservations about Rep. Paul’s claims, but the real pushback came from the guest following the retired congressman.
In light of the ongoing hostage crisis in Algeria, Cavuto asked Paul to comment on whether America should intervene more in the Middle East. The retired congressman, famous for his anti-interventionist views, said absolutely not:
I think it would be foolish. I think what we’ve been doing for so many years has been so very foolish. I think they ought to understand what ‘blowback’ is all about, and what the CIA has talked about. It’s just way too much. It hurts us to no end. One of the points I made when I gave my last little talk on the House floor was that one of the trends and problems we are facing was violent anti-Americanism. It’s all over the world. That is what is happening. We have a mess in Egypt now. We don’t know exactly what we are supposed to be doing in Syria. [...] I say what is happening in Mali and the hostages, it’s a spinoff from us getting involved in Libya and getting rid of [Muammar] Guaddafi. One thing leads to another. All these problems we have makes my case clear that we should have followed the Founders’ advice of staying out the entangling alliances and staying out of internal affairs of other nations, mind our own business and save a dollar now and then, because we’re flat-out broke.
Cavuto pushed back that some might say we’ll “regret” the non-intervention because “we’ll give the bad guys a free run.” Noting that terrorists are “not idiots,” the host mentioned that they have the ability to pack up and run from whichever country we are currently battling; and so, he asked, “Should we do anything about that or do we just let them brazenly go unobstructed?”
“We have to decide why we have the problem,” Paul replied. “If we decide it’s spontaneous and they hate Americans and there is al-Qaeda because they kill us and they don’t like our prosperity and they don’t like our freedoms, then you keep chasing them. If the problem of these threats toward us and the disruption is because we’re involved, than the answer is be less involved.”
Cavuto then asked: “What if they really hate us, they have everything we stand for, and … they just can’t stand us, they want us dead?”
“They might ask the same question,” Paul said. “What if we didn’t hate Muslims? We have to bring up a lot of hatred to go 6,000 miles away and kill people with drones. This is where the conflict is coming. We have to beat the drums of war in this hatred and go over and do these things and then all of a sudden we have an epidemic of suicides of American soldiers that come back, who ask, ‘What am I doing over here shooting drone missiles and little kids dying?’”
He continued on to say, “It’s a failed policy,” adding that we fail to understand that there is “blowback” from our involvement overseas, and that “if we don’t accept that, it is going to get much worse.”
“It’s going to get a lot worse as long as we think we are the king of the world,” he concluded.
Cavuto then ended the segment, thanking Dr. Paul and adding a jokey “I think” at the end to indicate his hesitation to imply agreement with anything the staunchly libertarian congressman had said.
And then when Cavuto turned to former CIA agent Wayne Simmons to discuss a related topic, the ex-agent asked to first fire back at the congressman’s remarks: “[He said] we shouldn’t act like kings of the world. Well, if we acted like kings of the world much more often and showed how powerful we were, we wouldn’t have all the mayhem.”

It’s quiet … too quiet. COME ON, RONULANS! It’s been weeks and weeks since you’ve had a chance to congregate on a Mediaite thread.

I may have to set out a little bait, since Ronulans are notoriously far more attracted to Austrian Von Mises “fiat money” nutsiness. Okay, here goes: Hey RONULANS – your Obi Wan Paulobi is CRAZY saying the U.S. is “broke”. That should do it.

Did Ron Paul also bring up those newspapers he is infamous for?






Anonymous



I respect Congressman Paul for  having the courage to speak up regularly in opposition to war. Because certainly war is hell. However, if we are not in the middle east then that situation there is much more dangerous. Consider that if any country or group of countries were embolden to mount a real assault on Israel, and if Israel felt threatened, you can bet they would use a tactical nuclear weapon before surrendering. And there is also this problem: One Islamic country already has nukes, and that country in under assault by terrorists who seek to destabilize its government and cause it to be taken over by Islamic fundamentalist extremists. We can not let that happen because then a couple billion people would be held hostage to thermonuclear blackmail. So we may not be liked fighting our unpopular war, and our soldiers are paying a big price, but being there prevents bigger stuff from happening. Isolationism does not work.

I think Wayne forgot that England expanded and expanded and expanded before they realized that their involvement and meddling helped sparked American’s Revolution, Ghandi to rise up, Hong Kong and many more entanglements in Africa and Asia to backfire before and after WW2.

    http://www.facebook.com/peterholthoffman                            Peter H Hoffman



What Wayne Simmons is effectively saying is that we should kill them all and let Allah sort them out.  I’ll concede that, from a cold logic perspective, that is a solution but the US doesn’t have the will-power to do it.  Therefore it’s a useless solution and he’s wasting people’s time.
He should just admit that the military industrial complex likes terrorists because they are the perfect excuse for endless war and the sales of systems that goes with that.  Politicians like terrorists because they are the perfect excuse for seizing power all over the world.
The losers in all of this are the regular people all over the world.

You have no proof that it doesn’t work, because we’ve never tried it, ever. Meanwhile, we have TONS of proof that interventionism doesn’t work.

Most Ron Paul supporters are not anti-Obama, they are pro liberty. Too bad the democrats don’t have any members with principles left, maybe this bombing campaign would be over. Haven’t heard much from the left wing anti war movement since Obama got elected, but I still see the Ron Paul people actively protesting everything from war to civil rights issues. Speaks volumes about who the real liberals are in this country.

You just made the point that Israel needs to defend itself, not that the US needs to be in the middle East. Nonintervention, what less educated folks call “isolationism”, has worked for many countries, including the US between the civil war and ww1.

Wrong, first of all our fore fathers warned us against interventionism and imperialism. All you have to do is look at  the our most prosperous  years as a nation. Because we stayed  out of other nations business. Being involved in conflicts and starting them is what has caused all of our problems. The world population views this country in a bad  light not because of how we live with freedom,but rather how they see our military attacking  everyone else’s in their sovereign land.  This country is headed for extinction. Just lie every other world empire for the same reasons. We have tried hold on and expand empire beyond our means and lost our ability to produce. We are the exact opposite of where we were in the years of the industrial revolution. From 1863-1910 we lead the world in prosperity and innovation ! Because we had no Federal Reserve Corp.,No federal income tax and therefore no Military Industrial Complex as a means and motivation to wage  imperialism on the rest of the world. Therefore we spent our peoples treasure and talent  on producing, innovation, industry and TRULY expanding freedom through trade.

Have you actually read the supposed racist newsletters?  The only place that I actually saw any text didn’t look racist to me.  He did make a comment about how many blacks had learned to depend on the government and blindly follow some of the Marxist black leaders, but he also stated that he knew that they were capable of taking care of themselves. (paraphrase).
It is a fact that more blacks are on government assistance as a percentage than any other group, but that doesn’t mean they have any less ability to take care of themselves.  Unfortunately, their supposed Democrat saviors have taught them to be dependent on govnernment and treated them like they were unable to take care of themselves and effectively re-enslaved many of them.
I do not believe that stating a provable fact is racist, although some take it that way.  The way the media has talked about the newsletters, makes them sound much worse than they actually were (unless someone can actually provide a truly racist comment from the newsletter).
I have seen a video of a black man whom Ron Paul treated as a patient.  The bi-racial couple were having a baby and the wife was having complications.  She went to several OB Doctors, but none would help her.  Ron Paul not only treated her and delivered the baby, he also did it for free.  This is not the sign of a racist.

The same thing happened to the Roman empire. The same thing happened to Napoleon.  It has happened many times throughout history.  If a country overextends their military, the country will fall.  The fall may be breaking apart; it may be ceasing to exist; and it may be falling back to a much smaller footprint.

Every time Ron Paul trounces someone in the school of logic and common sense, those that have ZERO intellect resort to playing the race card.  It happens quite often.  Ron Paul didn’t write those letters, and no one can ever produce a video tape or audio tape where he says anything racist. EVER.  In fact, as a libertarian, he goes out of his way to try to end the war on drugs.  Did you know that the war on drugs disporportionately imprisons a higher percentage of young black males than young white males?  Would a racist try to put a stop to that?  NO.
Why don’t you ask Walter E. Williams if Ron Paul is a racist.  He’s one of the men that Ron Paul was thinking about having as his running mate if he was nominated for president.  You probably don’t know who he is, because you obviously don’t spend much time reading real books.

It’s not top secret information. The information is out their for all to see. All you have to do is “read it”. But I guess it’s much easier to listen to someone else tell you what to think, right? Just as I don’t agree with Obama’s policies. I also don’t listen to Trump telling me he is an alien. I read this information myself and not allow others to dictate my thoughts. it has be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt he did not write them and he desolved them immediately after they came to surface over 20 years ago.
He was NOT the author. And was NEVER accused by anyone, other than you and your radicals of being so.

Ron Paul has admitted he should have monitored those newsletters more closely.  A good public servant admitted his mistake and learned a lesson from it.  It’s been proven time and time again that he did not write those letters.   People like the above troll can’t argue about the issue at hand, so they try to change the subject by playing the race card.    It’s just an act of desperation, because they know they are losing the argument.
If you think he might be the author, see if you can produce ONE single video or audio clip where Ron Paul espouses anything even remotely racist.  YOU CAN’T.   End of debate.

Forefathers? Are you joking? 
This country is headed for extinction? Nonsense. 
What are you afraid of? 30 years ago the world, and our nation was a much much more fearful place. 
Yes, America is playing the bad cop. We are not liked by certain groups of people. They get upset when a drone kills a few civilians, which is unfortunate, but part of war. For every accidental killing of an innocent, the enemy is killing a 100 and would prefer to kill a 1000 or 10,000 but they are finding it hard to do that because our men, and the drones that our men use to spare lives, have them in their sights. Without that, how long do you think it would take before the bad guys escalated all this to “biblical” proportions?

Our intervention in Pakistan and our drone attacks actually make it more likely that the government will be taken over by the terrorists and the circustances you cite result.  The Pakistani people HATE our intervention and HATE even more the drone attacks.  We have killed so many innocents, including woman and children, that they are terrified of being attacked and hate us even more.  Do you realize that we have done drone attacks on not only proven terrorists, but also those that might be terrorists (signature strikes), on the first responders trying to treat the wounded, and on the people that show up for the funeral.  Many innocents have been knowingly killed.  If China sent drones to America to kill their supposed terroists and did it the way we do to them killing many innocent woman and children, Americans would stand up and demand that we take out China.  Why is it OK for us to do, but not OK for others to do the same thing.  If it was done to us, we would call it terrorism.
I do want to say that I do not blame the soldiers who care greatly for our country and our liberty and who risk their lives every day in our service.  I blame the uncaring, egomaniacal, unintelligent leaders that we have in the legislative and executive branches.

I’m pretty sure many black people know who Ron Paul is. In fact, I know some who do. He’s just not liked because they, like most Americans, don’t like Paul’s policies. I know that’s hard to understand for the zealots who think anyone who doesn’t like Paul must either not understand him or are brainwashed, but the reality is that his ideas are basically based on pure fantasy that the Oh Mighty Invisible Hand of the Free Market will magically solve every problem in society. It’s nonsense. Not every problem is solved through stronger property rights. Sometimes the government must intervene on behalf of groups that can’t sufficiently defend themselves, hence, for example, the civil rights protections, which helped to protect black people from a majority of racist whites. Ron Paul would be fine to get rid of that law.

if your idea of muslims were so true, then the real solution would be to let them kill each other off. Because the simple truth of the matter is they spend more time and effort fighting each other!  And  the rest of the world can save the lives and treasure of it’s people by minding their own business and becoming prosperous and defending their  freedom from their own governments !!

The difference between Ron paul, Bush and Obama is, Republcians blindly follow Bush solely becasue he is Republican. Democrats blindly follow Obama solely because he is Democrat. The rest of us don’t follow any man or party, we follow an idea which Ron Paul  just happens to speak. We will still follow the same message after he is gone.
Our message and principles will not go away when he does.

What shocks me. Is even today, that’s ALL they can come up with. One newsletter that is ify on being racist that was written by someone else over 20 years ago. That’s all they have on him.

Right, you mean like “imaginary” Industrial Revolution from 1863-1913. It’s called a free market  for a reason. If you walk in to one store and don’t like the selection or price, then you are free to go elsewhere. Just like if you did not like the way you saw the treatment  given in business (i.e. racist treatment) you could not spend your money there. Just like immigrants that come  here and start businesses,learn real quick if they want to stay in business they better treat their customers right ! Competition breeds better products,and better prices. As far as your understanding of economics and property rights, you have none. The truth of the matter is that in every neighborhood where people own their own property and have property rights that area becomes well maintained and prosperous. All you have to do is look at government housing. My neighborhood is a prime example, of the market working.  8 yrs ago people would not be caught here after 6pm all business closed at 6 pm. 90% of the buildings were boarded up and abandoned. It was ridden with crime Now those same buildings house $2 and $3 million loft homes. All because people like myself chose to fight city hall and change the policies and laws to make it more market friendly to investment and property rights. We fought city hall the police force, and cleaned up a lot of corruption. And changed the tax  laws.






Anthony Spangler



As opposed to the liberal ideas that are basically based on pure fantasy that the Oh Mighty Invisible Hand of the Government will magically solve every problem in
society? We’ve seen that in action in China, the former Soviet Union, North Korea, Laos, Nepal, Cuba, Venezuela, California, and Chicago, and see how those turned out. I think I’d take Dr. Paul’s free market gods over government demons any day.






john Doe



Wrong again out of their (Obama’s and Panetta’s) mouth, they claim that killing 200 innocent people was acceptable if they got just one terror SUSPECT. NOT convicted criminal just some one they could claim they suspected of being or associating  with suspected terrorists !! They even said bombing a wedding filled with innocent people, to kill  one suspect was ok  with them!! This is why the world has no respect for us !! Your figures are imaginary !!  There is NO BOOGY-MAN !!   SO if your home town mall got double tapped by a drone, and innocent people (children) were killed that would be ok with you!!? Your mother was caught in the cross fire, that would sit ok with you!? There is a REASON our suicide rate among veterans is the highest it has ever been, they can live with guilt              of killing innocent people for no reason!!  And for all those that believe the way you do, please go volunteer to suicide bomb your terrorists  in some far away land. It will do wonders at weeding out the heard. = )  The rest of us will fight the real enemy, we will unseat our corrupt government !!  So please go. go fight in the name of MONSANTO, Mobile,Chase bank, and the like. the Federal Reserve corp. will appreciate your blood donation.

The “Invisible Hand” represent us — you and me and everyone else who makes decisions every day how to spend our resources. Ron Paul would be fine to get rid of the part of the Civil Rights Act that pretends to prevent racism in the private sector but in reality creates a field day for lawyers.

I would consider the circumstances, of course.  Considering the circumstances in Dr. Paul’s case, I stand by my statement that he either wrote them or his leadership is in question.

Do you actually read what your writing here before you send it? Because it is awfully foolish. Everyone knows Murdoch owns Fox news, so yeah his name is on it !! Even now People just Use Ron Paul’s name on things. There is domain name that bares his that someone else owns,…Hello, are you really that naive?

We have us a Chocolate Jesus 
Don’t go to church on Sunday
Don’t get on my knees to pray
Don’t memorize the books of the Bible
I got my own special way
Butit I know Jesus loves me
Maybe just a little bit more
I fall on my knees every Sunday
At Zerelda Lee’s candy store
Well it’s got to be a chocolate Jesus
Make me feel good inside
Got to be a chocolate Jesus
Keep me satisfied

And why is the government so qualified to intervene on behalf of those groups? Does the fact that a person works for the government makes them immediately morally superior? By magic? Like, having a badge that says “government” on it makes you flawless beyond reproach?
Is it possible that there’s as many evil people in the government as there is anywhere else? People who want to explore the weak just as much as the people you want to defend them from? Then, wouldn’t giving the government all this power to supposedly “defend” others mean you are just asking the wolf to guard the chicken coop?
Is it possible that all those policies that are supposed to defend the weak are weakening them even more? I.E.: Minimum wage laws have radically decreased the black middle class.
So yeah, there are people who know what Ron Paul is saying and still don’t like him. You aren’t one of them.

Dr. Paul has explained how and why he feels the way he does towards “civil rights”, gay rights, women’s rights etc. These labels only further divide the American people when we can all have the same protection and be covered under one title or label and that is human rights. See how that one doesn’t involve race, sex or religious beliefs? peace

Genius, He did own or write in those news letters. As far taking responsibility as you claim,agin more of your lies. He said he claimed, “morale responsibility” for not paying closer attention  to what went out IN his name. Further more he is incapable of being a raciest because unlike you, his philosophy sees people as important individuals,not as groups !! The other obvious point is Dr. Paul does not speak like that. THE ONLY RACIEST  I SEE HERE IS YOU. You have intelligent argument so you throw out baseless accusations.  If he was such raciest why is  he so vocal against the “DRUG WAR”  which targets people of color ! Why is he against the tyrannical government laws because they criminalize the individual freedom!?  And if this was so true why has NO ONE EVER HEARD HIM say anything like this in public with all the public speaking he has done over these years since 1976 in public office !!?

Wayne Simmons is a dumb ass.  I guess he didn’t interact with kids too much when he was growing up.  Every school yard has a bully.  Eventually, all the kids on the yard form a pact to take on the bully. Eventually, that will happen to Amerika. Look, I know as well as anyone that the radicals don’t hate us for our so called freedoms.  They hate us because our government has supported various dictators through out the region who have raised hell on their own people so that they could continue their kleptocratic ways. They hate Amerika because of it’s biased arbitration of the so called “Peace Process”. They hate Amerika every time a drone kills kids on its way to kill one man and so forth and so on.  We should find an alternative fuel source so that we can extract ourselves from the part of the world.  Like my relatives say, “Tell your government to leave us the hell alone. There’s enough money in India and China, so we won’t miss your money”.

So what your saying is you hated the (two)wars  under Bush, But when Obama promised to end them, but hen  turned around and continued them. Suddenly they are ok?  Or how bout the fact that he(obama) started 6 more wars and is on the way with two new ones Syria, and Mali !? I remember all the war protesters back in 03. I did not get involved till 04 my friend told me about the Patriot Act. But now I look around  and all those peace loving Bush hating protesters are cheering ,for dead children for daring to live close to drone strikes !!

You don’t understand, we are fighting a war, the bad guys really do want to kill as many people as they can because they are “terrorists”, and after they kill people, they intend to hold the prospect of more deaths over everyone’s head as a means of taking power. That is what terrorists do. Sorry to disillusion you. These people are the enemy of Islam, the Islamic people in the area, and every other citizen of the world, even if some people are confused about that. America prevents far more violence by being in the middle east right now, but peace is closer than you think. It will be Obama’s mark.
Its such a laugh that you down play the threat of people that want to nuke the world if they can, and then pivot to call our own government corrupt. Your values seem to say, yea, it is immoral to wage war and kill some innocents, and more moral to let thousands of times more people die, because, after all, it is none of our business. In fact it is our business. 
Our forces do indeed try very hard to kill as few innocents as possible. And that is virtually unprecedented in war. They frequently risk their lives, in that regard, and sometimes die or get wounded because of it. The drone attack is intended to replace having to send our men into harms way, and having to engage in fire fights in areas where large number of civilians would be at risk. Sometimes civilians do die in order to take out an important target. As few as possible. That’s war, I know it sucks. But it is much better than an all out Islamic civil war with millions of deaths, I can assure you.






john Doe



He’s the only candidate to ever call for an end the “Drug war” because it targets people of color.

You, apparently, believe that the “white people party” is the republicans. Mainstream media has educated u exactly as they intended, YOU ARE LOST. Somehow you are convinced that libertarians are republicans. I admit they are both right of the progressives that call themselves democrats, but that is about the end of the similarity.






Anonymous



I appreciate your opinion. As for drones, overall, they have saved more lives than those lost because they mitigate the need for US soldiers to put themselves in harms way and engage in fire fights. Lots of civilians die in that scenario also. Obama is not at all fond of war. As you know, he campaigned for the Senate in opposition to going to war. In those days, that was a political risk. But after taking office, after examining the whole situation, talking to world leaders, talking to generals, and so forth, he has chosen to stick it out in the middle east. I trust him on that.

I disagree about the success of the constitution. It has been one of the most successful documents ever written. It has brought more prosperity and freedom to more people (of all colors) than any other single document in the history of the written word. Maybe you have been educated in a government run school and have bought the deconstructionist history that omits the facts of the intentions of the founding fathers. The beauty of the internet is that now, if you choose, you can educate yourself properly by studying the federalist papers, and other documents of that time. Founding fathers designed the constitution so that it WOULD HAVE TO eliminate slavery at some point in the future.

Are you that damn dumb that you don’t know that it is the veterans, soldiers and social security people who get checks every month?  That is what is at stake – it has nothing to do with the budget and your fricking desire to cut us out of the social security money we paid in for years, but the checks the government has to send out to people like us.  It has nothing to do with the damn budget.  Particularly the  national debt doubled by the republican congress and George W Bush.

This government has been instigating hostilities in Syria,and getting ready to start hostilities in Africa, and you will sit here and say it is winding down!!? Wake UP!!  TAKE THE RED PILL !!  A BURDEN ??  Our deficit is  16.4 Trillion and rising,.. our GNP is $15 Trillion do you know what that means !!  We ARE BROKE  and have no hope of paying off this debt!!  As of now we can barely pay the interest !!  The only hope is to gut the federal government  take it back to the size it was in 1799. They can not even run the post OFFICE, and THAT is IN  the Constitution. One of the few responsibilities and authorities they actually have !!  So tell me again how you trust a government that broke itself and destroyed our constitutional rights in less than 100 years. Federal Reserve act of 1913. Tale end of the Industrial Revolution.   Our economy is going to collapse unless we unseat our government leaders that have failed us, and the rest of the world!! This is not a video game real people are dying !!

Oh no, what will these private central banks do? “We don’t have it and we can’t give Germany the tungsten filled fraudulent gold bars, they’ll figure it out”! “Wait, Mali is one of the largest producers of gold, let’s (France with the aid of the US) attack them for their gold and blame the attack over the presence of the (CIA created), boogeymen “Al-Qaeda”. 
The private central banks creating havoc and death around the world again to “fix their balance sheets” using military, paid for by the taxpayers.

The assertion that most of what government does is good for most of the citizens of this country is still widely believed. But that doesn’t make it true.  Foreign policy is just one glaring example where the government’s agenda is so thinly veiled as to be nearly transparent, but that doesn’t seem to have any effect on the overwhelming, blind partisan allegiance and obedience that has been cultivated. I suppose the two party system will have its way with the country until economic hardship forces the citizenry to reassess the value that government provides for the price that is paid.  I would never wish hardship on anyone, but if it would make people take notice to what the ruling class has perpetrated, I think in the long run it might be a good thing.

I know the GOP doesn’t want to admit it but this IS the reason they lost.most of us are just sick of this war, tired of sacraficing our soilders , sick of policing other lands while our borders are not safe, sick of giving $$$ to nations who harbor terrorists. the wars in the middle east have been going on as long as the middle east existed. Yes we need to protect our citizens and keep intelligence strong to prevent future attacks but we need to take care our own country which is being destroyed from within. I am a true conservative and agree with most of the GOP positions , but if you step back and see the big picture you will realize that the economy is a bigger threat to our freedom. I totally support our troops and what they do but the purpose of this war is to waer us down financially Ron Paul has a point

No, he was being a dedicated OB/GYN at the time those letters were written by someone else in his name. He was more focused on his oath to his patients than he was on the political outlet that he backed off from when he left congress the first time. This is why he admitted that he should have done more to ensure that his name was not being smeared like it was. His dedication and primary focus on his medical patients over his political side work is highly commendable. But I doubt you have the brains to even see the light of day on this man.

There’s never been any such thing as intervening.  And it’s worse than group think.  It’s time to use religion for what it was for, and to pull it from dreams like the American one.  Look at Venace.  Then look at American cities and suburbs.  Study Wethersfield, CT.  Understand why they debated, and, then just made it Web House, instead of The Web House.  Learn how they were terrorized and punished beyond what one could immagine, even for bringing up building stuff, and/or outside of the limitations they’d imposed upon them.  It wasn’t really for the fear of fire why their houses were forced into limited sizes confined together.  Colonization was/is the science of cultivating people into pseudo-educated, and into physically herded, and sensitized forms to survival that kept them/us measurable, and controllable from overseas, and from between the nations of the world also forced to communications between, and with the impositions of criminal international statutes to the sabotage of the potentials of all nations…  _:l

Look at the scale of, and the arrangements of the housing units constructed on the land sold behind the state of connecticut judicial building also in wethersfield.  Also in wethersfield, before the last battle of the Revolutionary War, George Washington had had to force the people who’d run the criminal prisons at the time into alliance.  Note also that there were more countries than England that had had us colonized at the time.  And note that those nations, over here, were run by huge powerful international companies more powerful than the rich colonization associated government people over here, but, also, even they’d been arranged with competing positions between the phenomena of other companies that simply flew the same flag.  Then note the size of Africa, already colonized and repseudo-educated before we were even a nation.  Then look at the size of England.  The phenomena that was different about them than the other European nations afflected by the same evils, is that the English language, I will reveal, was older than ancient latin, which, had been used as part of the science of colonization and the plot of using the science of colonization to set the populations of the world up into determinations, and into positions, and searching for food in denatured nature in wasys that did and do leave wisdom and the world in their control, not its/our own…

You are a sniveling moocher and looter. You want hand outs. But, you want to feel “proud” of your hand out because you “deserve it”. No. No, you don’t. You want to force unjust civil rights laws on everyone.   You are the racist. You want racist quotas for unqualified people to take jobs and positions in universities over men that have real qualification and have actually EARNED their spot there. You make me sick. Now, go cry to someone else that you “are not being given enough by the government” all the while knowing in your heart that you are a loser. An incompetent. And, that my friend, is why you are not getting “what you deserve” out of life. Not because the invisible hand of the free market doesn’t work.

And who is your politician of choice?  Let me guess, whoever it is has never made a mistake.  And the really important thing at question here, is whether or not Ron Paul shares the same beliefs that were written in the newsletters.  The answer to that is no.  So what is your point?
Obama BELIEVES in the idiotic things that he does.  He is a tyrant who is AGAINST the people and the Constitution of the United States.
Ron Paul has spent an entire political career trying to protect the liberty of the people and trying to protect the United States Constitution, from those (like Obama) who are out to destroy us.  If you are against Ron Paul, you are against the people and the Constitution.  That makes you a TRAITOR.

No, as a matter of fact, that someone else wrote some racist things and published it under Ron Paul’s name doesn’t bother me one bit, because, unlike you, I am intelligent enough to check out the story and do some more research on the man.  As a result of that research, I know what Ron Paul stands for.  I know that he is not a racist.  I know that what was in the newsletters could not have been written by him.  That is not how he thinks.  His principles have remained the same throughout 40+ years of public service.  Those are the facts.
People like you who point to the newsletters and call him a racist do it because you haven’t got enough intelligence to dispute the common sense arguments that Ron Paul brings for the cause of liberty.  You have to change the subject because you don’t know what you are talking about. It’s either that or you just hate that Ron Paul is fighting to protect the Constitution and the freedoms that are in it.  Freedom haters and Constitution haters like you will always exist.  It’s really sad that you do exist, but I want to thank you for exposing your weak intellect by your desperate attempt to play the race card.

I would reply by saying yes, our government has done something.  We have laws against murder already in place.  Had the shooter survived, he would have been put on trial and sentenced.  There is no reason to pass new laws.  We already have laws against murder.  Would passing another gun law prevent someone from breaking the law?
I would have also said that had the school not been a “gun free zone”, someone in the school who was legally armed might have been able to stop that shooter dead in his tracks before he killed so many people.  Did the “gun free zone” law prevent this guy from bringing guns to the school?  No, so how would passing another gun law prevent things like this from happening?






corri anderson



I agree.  I’ve never served but my anti-war stance is a direct result of my father’s service in Korea where he was a paratrooper.  He is still suffering from what he went through, what he saw.  But you are right, war is a part of our culture sadly.

How can people not see that the Civil Rights Act protected the racists?  It made white racists go underground and therefore no longer identifiable to the minorities.  This allowed the racists to stay in business as the years passed and the population turned against racism by preventing the growing anti-racist population from no longer patronizing the racist businesses as no one could tell them apart.  Instead of the market driving them into bankruptcy as their views fell farther and farther outside the main stream, they are alive and thriving today thanks to the government!  If not for the CRA, minorities would own these businesses today.

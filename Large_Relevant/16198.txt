What's craziest about watching this video is to realize just how FAST everything escalates. ﻿ One minute you're having a blast, and literally the next minute flames are engulfing the room and everyone is in a mad panic.

With many patrons at the beginning of the video showing the satanic hand sign aka horned hand, it was already a bad omen.﻿ In the spiritual realm, nighclubs are really the houses of the devil, where once every few years, he will require human sacrifices to be offered to appease him. The unwitting people who will carry out this scary deed are always the rockbands with their pyrotechnics. It is the same story all over again in US, Russia, Thailand & now Brazil & we won't be hearing the end of it.

 Your intentions are good, but they can't work in something like this. One of the 1st things they told me when I took swimming lessons 30 years ago was something like, "Anyone in a panic will hold on to you to escape. You have to be there, but not be drowned with them so when the rescuers get there; they only need to save one and not two". And it's not their fault either.﻿ Human nature makes you want to live.

He was charged for doing just that based on his own film! He stated in court that he had stopped to move a table aside. But I agree w/you that he should have gotten the hell out﻿ of the way. I don't see how he could have just stood there filming after exiting.

I've never seen this full version. My fiance' started crying when she heard a female voice screaming for her mama about the same time﻿ as the flames reached those trapped in the hallway. There were many tho that did get out even from right up at the stage. The right split-second choice and luck!

The only explanation is that the band had not escaped yet and he did not want the door jammed and then rendered impassable by the flames before they﻿ escaped. That door was near the start of the fire and the fire made it impassable very quickly. The bouncer also may have thought of his own escape through there. One staff member actually said that he felt safe knowing that no one knew about the kitchen exit and he could escape that way so he did not want to tell others of it, it's implied.

Worse is when he passes﻿ the stage door you hear their screams like never before even though be passed there just a few seconds earlier, and see the flames come out of the doorway as he decides not to pass between the building and the bus.

Conservatives Wetting Pants Over Old Video Of Eric Holder Blaming Media For Gun Violence

For some weird, undefinable reason, there doesn’t seem to be anything Attorney General Eric Holder can do to get conservatives to agree with him, even by agreeing with them. Conservative outlets like Newsbusters, Breitbart.com, and The Blaze are in freakout mode over a 1995 video that they say shows Holder, then the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, trying to “shame gun owners,” and make them “cower like smokers.”
Unfortunately, even the shorter version they’re pimping now makes it clear that Holder wasn’t talking about lawful, responsible gun ownership, but rather, combating the media’s glorification of gun violence, particularly to young people.
From Newsbusters:
The hot new video at MRCTV.org is 1995 footage of Attorney General Eric Holder, when he was the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. In his remarks before the Woman’s National Democratic Club, broadcast by CSPAN 2, Holder said people should be ashamed to own guns, just the way that cigarette smokes now “cower outside of buildings” to smoke.
The “hot new video at MRCTV.org,” says the MRC’s Newsbusters? Well, this, we gotta see! Let me just take a sip of Diet Rite, the hip new beverage I got from the RC vending machine.

Now, unless responsible, lawful gun owners carry guns in order to be “hip,” and out of a media-driven “fascination with violence” and with guns, and are “particularly our young men,” as Holder says, he is clearly not talking about them. He’s talking about countering the violent movies and TV shows, which Wayne LaPierre agrees are to blame for gun violence, with messages that make carrying guns as symbols of coolness unacceptable. There’s absolutely no ambiguity to what he is saying.
However, if this clip doesn’t quite capture Holder’s meaning well enough for you, there is a longer version available. Even though Newsbusters notes that their “hot new video” was “found” by Breitbart.com contributor Charles Johnson (not that Charles Johnson), this longer version was actually posted almost a year ago by… Breitbart.com editor Joel Pollak. I guess Johnson, like most people, doesn’t read his own site.
In the extended tape, Holder repeatedly underscores that he is talking about “youngsters,” encouraging them to report other young people who are carrying guns, and discusses working with school boards on anti-gun messaging. He even references airing commercials during popular programs like The Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Martin, a reminder of just how long we’ve been having this discussion.

I started a drinking game for every time Holder references local young people in this video, but I ran out of rum and Diet Rite. For some reason, it doesn’ t matter what Barack Obama’s Attorney General, Eric Holder, says or does, conservatives just hate, hate, hate him. They hate him so much, they even forget they already hated him for the thing they newly hate him for. This outrage is not only fake, it’ s recycled. Not only did Breitbart.com already cover this “hot new video” in March, so did The Blaze. The intervening months haven’ t improved their comprehension skills any.

Tommy,
 I appreciate you taking the intellectual high-road with your headline but you should have gone the whole nine yards and went with the presidential phrase:  “Wee-Wee’d Up” instead of “Wetting Pants”

Holder is the spokesman for the Low Information Voter who need to be told how to live their life. It’s an old CIA tactic that they use in countries where they want to form public opinion like Joseph Goebbels did for Hitler. Some things never change. Theirs always one asshole!

The paranoia afflicting  the conservatives is so bad that, their own shadow scare them and they seem unable to snap out of it. The few sane voices are drown by the loud noise of the crazies and conspiracy theorists with no end in sight.






Michele Gardner



….and smoking weed and doing drugs. How’s that drug war going? It’s amazing how the argument gets switched. Many conservatives argue that weed and other drugs need to be heavily banned/regulated because of the cost to society. However, Liberals retort that drugs will always be present and conservatives are foolish to expect anything different through regulation. In the argument over guns conservatives purport that absolutely nothing should be done in terms of regulation because “it won’t work anyways” and guns will always be on the market legally or illegally no matter what regulations are in place. Yet, when it comes marijuana they can’t see the same line of thinking, at the same time liberals can’t see that line of thinking with guns. I believe are views are much more shaped by party politics more than by rationality. If they weren’t we wouldn’t constantly be changing our conception of human nature to fit our party’s political agenda.






freedomrocks4



Are you drunk or high now?   What the hell are you babbling about? This article is about Eric Holder.

If you see someone in the past who is now in a position of immense power say that he wants to brainwash people, it is not paranoid to be concerned, but rather it is completely rational.

I would have had the utmost respect if the video had shown Holder advocating for the United States regulating guns like civilized nations do (throw a dart at a map of Europe for finding the random civilized nation).  Of course that would have been political suicide for Holder to have advocated such a position.
But your point about an ideological right wing afflicted with ODS and HDS is spot-on.  The excellence of your opinion, TC, is always reflected in the large number of forum posts by the vile right wing and the intensity of their personal attacks against you.

“….it doesn’ t matter what Barack Obama’s Attorney General, Eric Holder, says or does, conservatives just hate, hate, hate him. They hate him so much, they even forget they already hated him for the thing they newly hate him for.” – Tommy Christopher

“I started a drinking game for every time Holder references local young people in this video, but I ran out of rum and Diet Rite.”
Next time, you should wait until you are sober before you post.
“This outrage is not only fake, it’ s recycled. Not only did Breitbart.com already cover this “hot new video” in March, so did The Blaze.”
Both sites initially used the video in question as a warning to gun rights advocates. Now what we were warned of is taking place. Maybe MRC posted the video again so as to give your naive and inept ass a chance to report on it for the first time.

The headline over this story is solid enough to entice hundreds of readers and it certainly caught my attention. But when I clicked to the “comments” section I found that, despite the fact that this story has been up for a few days, there were only 37 contributors.
That surprised me. But I then noticed that the author was the paripetetic Mr. Christopher, who seems to delight daily in fellating the liberal political cause. A glance at other pieces on mediaite.com by Mr.Christopher indicated a similar paucity of comment.
Apparently, very few people read this fellow’s work, which is not surprising when you consider the weakness of his writing. It’s one thing to carry a bias into these pieces. I don’t really mind that so much. But it’s quite another to sound as if you’re a personal wet-maid to the President and the Democratic Party.

Tommy just hates it when the liberals own words are used against them. He always has excuses.
No matter which tape you look at or how many times you look at it, Holder is anti-gun. He and Obama both have the same agenda.

Maybe if you’d comment sober you’d understand the point Holder is making.  All he’s saying is that we don’t want young men to associate having a gun with being cool.  Do we need to revise the bumper sticker, “They can have my guns when they pry them from my cold, dead and totally hip fingers”?

Yes, when what you want to hear is that Holder is going after your guns, “no matter which tape you look at or how many times you look at it, Holder is anti-gun.”  It doesn’t matter what he actually says.  It doesn’t matter that he’s addressing the issue of gun violence among the youth.  He must mean he’s after everyone’s guns.

The irony here is how you illustrate again the right’s inability to interpret things stated by Obama, Holder, etc. in ways that don’t suit their preconceptions.  It doesn’t matter what the stated purposes where for Fast and Furious; the “sole purpose” was to create “gun violence.”  Yeah, they just wanted shoot-’em ups for the sake of shoot-’em ups.

I’d love from you an admission that Holder’s not saying anything that’s at all controversial would be nice.  Of course, that requires you actually listen to what he says.  So, sure, I’ll settle for a peanut.

I know you disagreed.  I simply asked for evidence from the extended clip to defend your claim.  You said that was a strawman and claimed that no one made that accusation.

“change the way people think about guns, especially young people”   clearly Holder is refering to “all people” with a highlight on young people….    “we have to brainwash people”   clearly refering to all people






Anonymous



Brainwash: “to adopt radically different beliefs by using systematic and often forcible pressure.”  
He’s saying that currently a lot of youth grow up associating guns and gun violence with being cool.  He wants them to adopt “radically different beliefs”– i.e., to believe there’s something shameful about promoting gun violence or engaging in it to be cool.  He’s advocating going about that “using systematic” pressure– i.e. ad campaigns and so forth.  But none of his comments imply “forcible pressure.”  
Now, granted, most of us associate “brainwashing” with “forcible pressure” so it’s a poor choice of words. Fine. 
But to suggest that this means he’s out to abolish 2nd amendment rights is just paranoia.

freedomrocks4



You lost on your first point, now you want to create another strawman…..lol cute






Anonymous



No, I didn’t.  You’ve missed the point throughout.  It’s not that Holder’s saying we don’t want people owning guns.  It’s that we don’t want people owning guns because they think it’s cool.  That’s the case whether you’re young or old, but hopefully once you reach a certain age you’re not prone to that sort of thinking.  It’s young people– young men in particular– that are susceptible.  So that’s why, even though it’s true about everyone, Holder focuses on young people.  Because, not only are they more susceptible to the influence of popular culture, they shouldn’t be owning guns period.  
So, no, I’m not creating strawmen.  I’m trying to clarify the main point of his remarks.

No, I’m trying to explain it to you– because you obviously missed the point of what he was saying.

So TC was wrong….Holder is talking about everyone..thanks






Anonymous



Are you being serious?  
No, TC’s not wrong.  This is a strategy for getting guns out of the hands of young people. 
Because Holder acknowledges that it’s not only young people who are susceptible to the idea that owning a gun makes you cool does not mean that the strategy described here is about taking away everyone’s guns.






freedomrocks4



Did you read the article? TC’s point was that Holder’s speech was only addressing young people..not gun owners, not everyone,  that premise is false…I have not mentioned or said anything about taking away guns, quit making stuff up






Billr



Why didn’t they just have Breitbart stuffed and mounted?

He is only talking about a strategy for keeping guns out of the hands of young people.  I’m not making anything up.  Just because he makes a passing reference to “everybody” does not mean that they’re the focus.  It’s not about everybody.

Fortunately the leaves the entire Republican party out of the picture.

really? like smokers cowering outside.   If you believe Holder is only talking about young people as TC states…..fine, ignore the facts, I dont care






Anonymous



It was an analogy for how we need to change public perceptions.  Young people who wield guns shouldn’t feel like they’re being cool.  They should feel like they need to cower like some smokers do.  That it is shameful behavior.
“Ignore the facts” must mean “adopt my paranoia.”

You know, it occurs to me, I have no idea what you think Holder’s talking about in this clip.  You said you don’t think it’s about taking away everybody’s guns.  And yet you keep insisting that he’s talking about “everybody.”  What is he talking to everybody about?






freedomrocks4



Is he talking about guns and gun violence among only younger people or everyone?   pick one






freedomrocks4



So you believe his speech only had to do with young people? yes or no  simple






Anonymous



He was presenting a strategy for keeping guns out of the hands of young people.  He argues that part of the problem is that young people have this perception that having a gun makes you cool.  Whether you are young or old that is a misconception.  So, even while the focus is on young people, he does make reference to adults– ie everyone.
There’s a difference between referring to everyone or making points that have implications for everyone and having the focus be on or the point be about everyone.






freedomrocks4



everyone., thank you …that is the only point I addressed in my comment

An old commi , Marxist , fascist , socialist adage is teach the children ,own the future.Its a little late for instilling ,when you consider rappers with record labels like murder inc, movies and games based on violence have been  an accepted form of entertainment for decades . MSM personalities label black conservatives as corn balls or worse. While giving radical liberals a pass on anything they say.Ya its time to instill values alright . Its just like one of the four above , to come up with a solution for the very problem they created to begin with .Its time you dismount from that dysfunctional donkey  and started working on whats best for your country ,as opposed to whats best for your party !

This is too easy- here let me help you chump:
Tommy says:
“For some reason, it doesn’t matter what Barack Obama’s Attorney General, Eric Holder, says or does, conservatives just hate, hate, hate him. They hate him so much, they even forget they already hated him for the thing they newly hate him for. ”
Really? So Holder has done nothing, its just irrational hate that makes him a target?
Do I really have to list all the grievances against the justice department? Or have you been sleeping in a cave the last four years? Or perhaps you have had you head all up in TC’s butt for so long that you cant see.

Brainwashing Americans to hate their 2d Amendment rights is not something one wants an AG to advocate, a person who ostensibly takes an oath to uphold the Constitution.






Anonymous



I suppose it is “too easy” when you totally ignore what’s being said. 
For instance, I never said that Tommy “is never wrong.”
Tommy wasn’t saying that the right has never had grounds for criticizing Holder, Obama.  He’s saying that their hate runs so deep that no matter what they do or say the right hates it– in this case, when Holder makes the same point Wayne LaPierre made.
But I’m glad you got a laugh out of it.






Anonymous



My goodness.  The issue here is whether the strategy Holder is outlining is about getting guns out of the hands of young people or whether this is his strategy from infringing on every American’s second amendment rights.  
But you want to make a big deal about the fact that he occasionally makes reference to people in general.  It doesn’t matter why he referenced them; it’s just that he refers to them at all.  That’s the problem– in your mind.  That’s your “gotcha.” 
Who cares?  Who cares if he happens to reference the broader population unless those references indicate that the program he’s outlining has implications for them?  
Unbelievable.  What a waste of time.

Except that’s not what he’s saying.  
He’s talking about young people who want to possess a gun in order to be cool.  He’s saying we need to instil different values.  
My gosh, it’s not that complicated a point.  Nor is it controversial.






Anonymous



My point has remained the same throughout.  No one is denying that the Holder speech doesn’t make occasional references to everybody.  That’s only significant if those references imply that the strategy he’s laying out for getting guns out the hands of the youth apply to the population in general. No one has provided any evidence along those lines.

So if Holder all of a sudden made a u-turn on policy and, for example, decided to investigate the black panther voter intimidation case, your and Tommy’s contention is that, no matter what, he’d still be opposed on that by conservatives because they just hate him soooo much?
Do you realize how stupid that sounds?
so absolutely, that is an idiotic premise that deserves to be ridiculed.
Its all about policy, stupid- and when you have nothing left but to paint your opposition as having some ethereal hatred for you that defies logic, thats when you know your policy ideas are bad and can’t be defended rationally.

So, again, it doesn’t matter what he actually says you just know that behind it all is an agenda to take away your 2nd amendment rights.  You know that’s the case because your spidey sense is tingling or something.






Anonymous



Here’s an example of Eric Holder attempting to address the issue of guns and young people.  Is he proposing stricter gun laws?  Is he saying it’s time to get rid of the 2nd amendment?  No.  He’s actually saying something relatively close to what Wayne LaPierre was saying.  That we need to counter the culture which creates a fascination with guns and gun violence.  We need to keep kids from thinking a gun makes them cool.  
And yet how does the right react?  They attack him.  They say he is in fact attempting to take away 2nd amendment rights.  
That’s the point of the article.






Anonymous



What the hell are you talking about?
This video of Holder is like a thousand years old. This isnt the attorney general speaking now. All it takes is just the slightest bit of critical thinking and the ability to discern policy positions to know that the NRA and the AGs positions on gun control are pretty far apart.
I get it though- critical thinking is not your strong suit- especially when you think the NRA and Holder are the same because TC says so. 
Besides, who has less credibility on this issue than Holder? The justice dept. purposely allowed 1600 assault weapons to go directly into the hands of incredibly violent criminals- kinda makes him the last person who should be talking about gun control, dont you think?
Or do you not have any outrage over fast and furious? Tommy sure doesnt- here he is mocking the reporting of it:

I don’t think you’re interested in reading what I actually write.  You’d prefer to assume that I’m saying something I’m not and then tell me it’s ridiculous.

just what the hell is just yours that you think you can take backanyway???????

nice dodge. Nothing to say about F & F huh? shocker.
I did read your post- your premise is, based on a truncated speech Holder gave 15+ years ago, we have to believe that his position on gun control is no different than the NRA’s. I mean, LOL. thats just absurd. 
Does this sound like a statement the NRA would make?
http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-4831751-503544.html
“Well, as President Obama indicated during the campaign, there are just a few gun-related changes that we would like to make, and among them would be to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons. I think that will have a positive impact in Mexico, at a minimum.”
Holder clearly is on record as wanting strong gun restrictions- You pretty much have to be brain-dead in order to think otherwise…but then again, you do defend Tommy McNutty here, So being brain-dead is not out of the realm of possibility for you at all.

Gee, it’s like Fox wannabes edited the tape to advance the agenda of lies and misinformation again.

Not talking about F&F is not a dodge on my part.  It’s a red herring on your part (though I suspect I’ll hear a good deal more about it in your response).  This thread is about the right’s reaction to these nearly 20 year old comments by Eric Holder.  
You’ve been so quick to claim I’m being “ridiculous” and “stupid” and so forth that there’s little chance that you’ll own up to the fact that you’ve simply misunderstood from the beginning. 
For instance, I’m not saying that the NRA and Holder are in complete agreement on every gun policy matter.  On a host of issues, they are far a part. That is not the point. 
The point is that the right has pulled this clip out of the moth balls and expressed outrage over it.  The irony of it being that basically what Holder is saying is not all that different from a point of emphasis in Wayne LaPierre’s press conference.  Both criticize our culture for glorifying gun violence– that this contributes to young people’s fascination with guns.
Why can’t the right simply recognize the commonality between the two sides on this one particular point?  This is the question that TC attempts to address.  He argues that the right hates Obama and Holder so much that even when there’s alignment they can’t see it.  They can only conclude that what Holder’s saying here is one more way Holder is demonstrating disdain for people’s 2nd amendment rights.
Again, the issue is not whether the right has grounds for disliking Obama and Holder.  The issue is why, when Holder says something that the NRA itself emphasized recently, the right can’t even recognize this point of agreement.  
You should work on belittling people less and trying to understand more.

Sigh. Do I really have to do this? 
“What we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people, and make it something that’s not cool, that it’s not acceptable, it’s not hip to carry a gun anymore, in the way in which we’ve changed our attitudes about cigarettes. You know, when I was growing up, people smoked all the time. Both my parents did. But over time, we changed the way that people thought about smoking, so now we have people who cower outside of buildings and kind of smoke in private and don’t want to admit it.”
At the end of this clip, Holder says anti-gun ads should run every day, and we need to “really brainwash people to think about guns in a vastly different way.”
Yeah, I cant tell who said that…it might as well have been LaPierre! LOL.
Here’s where your and TC’s argument blows up in your face- while sure, its likely that the NRA and Holder from 1995 do share some commonality, that doesnt mean that there is no reason to be alarmed by this portion of the quote.
Its like me saying that I am pro-abortion- so since you are pro-abortion too, you have no right to disagree with me if I also want to make a one child policy mandatory and you dont.
What you dont see is the mendacious attempt by TC to make any and all opposition to democrat policy personal. Oppose Obama? You are racist. Oppose Holder? Yup, only because he’s black. Oppose Janet Neapolitano? You are sexist, and a homophobe.
So that either makes you an unwitting accomplice, or complicit in these Alinskyite tactics. So I am sorry, but that makes you either dumb or deceitful. I do have a good feeling about you personally though- there may be a decent person deep down, so Im going to stick with my first impression here, and just think you dont know any better.

Thank you for a more reasonable engagement with the issues at hand.  
That said, you’re still wrong on a couple of things.  First of all, this is a clip in which Holder is laying out a strategy for getting guns out of the hands of young people.  This is something that we should all agree is necessary.  The second thing we should all agree on is that owning a gun because you think it gives you status– i.e. makes you cool– is a bad reason for owning one.  
To create a campaign that counters the idea that owning a gun is cool is not necessarily an anti-gun campaign.  It’s an anti-false conception of gun ownership campaign.  
We might have wanted Holder to assert more often that this isn’t about taking away people’s second amendment rights.  He does not.  However if we frame his comments within the context of disarming youth, we find those less alarming.  If however, as conservative media did, we provide a framework that says, “This is Holder talking about our 2nd amendment rights,” we are likely to find it very alarming.  But, given his intentions, it seems to me that the first way of framing the comments lends itself to a more accurate read.  
Finally, it’s unfair to say that TC’s argument here “blows up in your face” because TC believes that criticism of the president can only arise from racism.   Race does not come up in this piece.  What’s more, even when race comes up, TC never says– as far as I’ve read– that criticism itself is racist or sexist or whatever.  That’s too simplistic a response.  And while the Left may be too quick to accuse the Right of being racist, the right has been too willing to turn a blind eye toward the history of race relations in this country and their own ongoing role.

One more comment about the bit about being an “unwitting accomplice.” My willingness to take what Holder says at face value probably sounds to you hopelessly naive– that when he says that this is about getting guns out of the hands of youth, that’s what he means.  And that, even comments that seem to have implications for the broader population, must be understood in that context.  
I believe that anything “big” must be viewed with some skepticism– whether big gov’t, big labor, or big business.  I admit that I reserve the highest level of skepticism for big business.  I’m not anti-capitalist.  Part of what makes me skeptical of big business is the way they rig the system to their benefit.  It’s the fact that, in a sense, big business can be so anti-capitalist.  A good deal of my skepticism toward the gov’t is the way in which big business influences it to serve its objectives.  
The skepticism you have for Holder’s comments I have for LaPierre’s.  I think the NRA represents, not so much gun owners, but gun manufacturers.  They are constantly stoking fears about the gov’t and they benefit richly from those fears.  Gun sales go through the roof.  
I’m skeptical, for instance, of LePierre’s comments regarding Hollywood.  After all, as you may have seen, while LaPierre’s was making his comments lambasting Hollywood, the NRA’s museum was hosting an exhibit called “Hollywood and Guns” which featured famous fire arms in film.  That, my friend, is a mixed message.

You are right, I am sure both Holder and NRA are in sync with wanting to remove guns from the hands of kids. The problem is there is more context than just this old speech- Holder is on record for an assault weapons ban. Therefore its understandable if some on the right interpreted his old speech, which very well may have been ONLY about kids in 1995, encompassing everyone, since that’s something he has articulated in other ways afterwards. Therefore, if interpreted that way, I think its justifiable to be bothered by Holder desiring to make owning a gun “shameful” .
But you seem reasonable and I will accept what you are saying, coming from you: Too bad Tommy isnt articulating anything the same way you are- after all, being reasonable doesnt generate the outrage, and subsequent viewership, as being provocative…which brings me back to what I was saying in my original post.
I’ll give you some advice though: I’d delve more deeply into the history of what TC has written before aligning with his point of view. The man is made a career out of interpreting racist coding and dog whistles, and has written numerous stories about everything Obama opponents do that he thinks is racist- so dont be fooled just because racism wasnt mentioned here.
The guy is a bottom feeder: no story is too petty, no premise too low with him…his method of journalism is the proverbial throw-everything-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks approach, knowing there is no real downside because hey, when you are as low as he is, there nowhere to go but up. I could cite the numerous examples of what he has written about in the past, seeing racism from saying Obama is ‘aloof’ to mentioning he plays basketball being racist, but frankly its exhausting, and his circular logic makes me dizzy.
What I really take exception to (and MSNBC has created an entire network from this premise) is being characterized as having personal hatred for a political opponent, and therefore that is my sole motivation for opposing them.
I oppose Eric Holder because he has been involved in deeply questionable activities while in office, and I dont agree with his political world view. I have serious concerns about Pigford, about the Justice department’s definition of racism under Holder, and of course of their illegal gun walking program. I dont know the man personally, and I dont hate him, or anyone for that matter. These false characterizations of personal hatred are clearly intentional- its meant to belittle and dismiss any real concerns and criticisms of this administration. Its an intentional dissembling to defend this president and his administration from the legitimate scrutiny that’s due to them. 
Now you may very well comeback with that I cant dismiss that there are real racists out there, and real hatred of Obama. But I argue that I can- because facts are facts. Even if I really were a racist who hated Holder and Obama because they are black, it doesnt change the details of the fast and furious case, and doesnt mean that its invalid for me to want to know the details about Benghazi. Or Solyndra. Or even, dare I say it, whether or not Obama has a proper birth certificate or not. Now dont worry, I think the birther thing was stupid, but it doesnt make me a racist if I didnt. 
After all, there’s no doubt I could find quite a few things you disagree with Clarence Thomas on, and if Thomas turned out to be illegible to be in the supreme court due to a technicality, like a forged birth certificate, Im sure you would be enthusiastically trying to find out everything you could on it, right? Would that be racist of you though, to want to kick out the only black member of the Supreme Court? Of course not- you just disagree with him politically and would be happy to see him go right? Well there’s your “birther” motivation in a nutshell.
Sadly you never see “journalists” like TC brandish the race card if Thomas is opposed or challenged, or when Thomas is called something that really does have racial connotations, like Uncle Tom. Any opposition to Thomas is disqualified as being racial, simply because of ideology- and that is a severe and stark double standard.
The history of race relations is way too much to tackle here- I just say that the well has been poisoned too much by profiteers and demagogues like TC to make any real progress right now…thats why we need to clear the decks and start fresh so we can try to build bridges again- and thats never going to happen when you have guys like TC intentionally setting fire to those bridges. 
But the real dirty secret is: those fire starters who profit, or (in TC’s case) make a name for themselves by being a race provocateur, have no interest in real change…after all, their power derives from the status quo. and that’s from both sides. But you know what? I think that gives Tommy a little too much credit…he’s more like a race provocateur wannabe than the real thing. He does, however, know that his tactics work to win short term gains- and thats all this is about- winning the 24 hour news cycle for your side.

This is no good, BarneyFranken. Most often the lesson I learn from engaging in these discussions is that no progress is possible.  That it’s a waste of time.  And then you went and did this– wrote both passionately and respectfully.  I spend too much time commenting on these things to begin with.  Now you’ve given me hope that these can become meaningful.  
Oh, well.  
Take care.

we keep hearing about how "Hitler disarmed the german people". this is incorrect. germany's gun laws were actually much more restrictive under the weimar government which preceded the election of the national socialists (nazis) in 1933. the new government under hitler made it much easier for﻿ germans to keep and bear arms! it has always been the leftist and communist governments who have restricted or confiscated guns leading up to or just after taking power.

Yes, it made it easier to own a firearm in Germany, if you weren't Jewish. Starting 30 January 1933, Hitler's plan started to take form and you are right, Germans were able to own firearms (as long as they were not Jewish). Once the Nazis were able to target the KPD and get them out﻿ of the way, they were able to carry out their agenda of Genocide. History has taught this lesson over and over, when one group has complete control of the other, it's bad juju. Please go back and look for yourself.

The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails America﻿ . Blaming the prince of the fools should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools that made him their prince. The Republic can survive a Barack Obama, who is, after all, merely a fool. It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools such as those who made him their president

@justachipn
hers a quote I very much love to display when possible!
A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his﻿ victims

, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to﻿ undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear. The traitor is the plague.
Marcus Tullius Cicero

Zero evidence for it being legit leads me to believe it's entirely made-up, like many other quotes have been. Guncite.com has a good list of REAL quotations as well﻿ as which ones have been debunked.

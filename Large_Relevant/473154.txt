None of the candidates could have fixed what has happened in one presidential turn. It will take many years just to keep floating. Most Americans do not know so much about the world around them and seem to want to live as an Island. Many countries are﻿ struggling to survive the economy crises. You guys aren't the only ones. I think you made a good choice by electing Obama and he has opened doors for the American nation towards other countries. He did the only thing that he or anyone else could do

To Americans just wondering why their is so much hate towards Obama and his healthcare plan?
I live in England , and ultimately there is some criticisms but it is a good service - and overall it helps to achieve the gov't objective of limiting the gap between the rich and the poor
It seems the current American situation benefits only﻿ the richer in society and what you might not hear the NHS in England provides﻿ treatment for all - it dose not leave people to die !
feedback ? thanks

haha man you people in America have a leader to be proud of.
I dunno if it's just﻿ the speech writers but either way this is some funny shit and a very welcome break from what I normally see from the USA.
The best bit is that the jokes are all close to the bone, confident and funny, and I think that reflects a part of American society very well.

That is the reason though, many people are impatient, too dumb to understand economics and too greedy to wait for results.
He got caught red handed doing what? Knocking one out?
You shut up, McCain and Palin would have been terrible for America and you know it. Now their supporters are all feeling hurt and upset but rather than think about where they went wrong they waste time attacking﻿ the opposition.

did i say mcain and palin would be good?. least they wouldn't of﻿ been as deceptive as obama having people like you falling for it. And you came back with what i said not to say but you re worded it, and what do you mean got caught doing what you cant even watch the film. You just assume everything acting all smug doesnt make you clever. watch the film and shut the mouth,.or are you to scared to?.

You said 'not to say it' because you know it's the truth. Since when does anyone do what you﻿ say? Never, clearly.
You just don't want to admit Obama was a better choice than McCain do you?

It's all propaganda of some sort but you're missing the point entirely. I am not American, I didn't vote for anyone. Obama has the effect of making foreigners like America more.
It's easy to attack everyone, because then you don't have to support anyone and thereby avoid people attacking you, but sitting on﻿ the fence pissing and moaning about everything won't get you anywhere Paul. The easiest people to control are those in fear.

Obama's policies are﻿ failing left and right. Unemployment remains steady at 10-11% and the stimulus money is being used for pet projects. His administration is shoving socialized medicine down the throats of America, whether we like it or not. The majority of the stimulus is being given to the states represented by Democrats. Anybody who openly opposes his administration is being dubbed as a terrorist. Believe me, Obama and the Democrats are not in it for us!

What are you talking about? Doesn't the US have several state lotteries? Which one are you talking about had that sequence? Even if you're telling the truth: Coincidences aren't conspiracies.
I don't know, next you'll be commenting if Obama does anything at 11:06 in the morning it's BAD cause that's the 666th minute of the day or if he﻿ dares to say anything discouraging on 17 November 2010 (the 666th day of his presidency) then that will fulfill some kind of 'prophecy'.

The legal system, courts, juries, justice alone and no one else must try Obama and rule upon his crimes, among which faking his identity to become president and thus accessing the nuclear force by fraud
That's the USA highest treason, being the Army's top security violation. That bears the death penalty which alone, and not us, courts of law can hand down !
Obama's marked also by the heavenly number 666, the Antichrist's Mark,﻿ on his election day

There's a secret aerosol spraying program worldwide. Search for "chemtrails", "Dont talk about the weather", "Endgame HQ".﻿ I filmed it (my chan). The world needs you. Wake up and wake others! Friend me.

I do cringe at his remarks about the need﻿ for a vibrant media considering the whole anti-FOX thing lately. Do I like FOX? Hell no. But I don't think it's the right or duty of the government to meddle in those affairs. I'm surprised this portion of his speech wasn't brought into the whole debate.

Can you cram any more Limbaugh talking points in there? I'm not sure there was enough. Look, you've got to be ignorant if you think this all happened in even the last 3 years, let alone during Obama's time. And don't start with me, I'm﻿ not in favor of much of what he's done. But too many people in this country seem have the memory of a fruitbat, and don't know know the history of legislation, nor it's far-reaching impacts. This crisis has been 25 years in the making. ALL parties are to blame.

Bush took the USA into 2 wars based on a lie. He stoled money from Iraq and gave it back﻿ along with some of the US dollars during what was called a surge. Bush and friends bankrupt the US for 8 years and made billions for his oil companies/friends. Bush started borrowing money from China and importing all their garbage products with little export. Allowed the auto industry of America to tank along with 1000s of factory jobs. You Bush lovers have been bushedwacked.

freight; you sound like a rich neocon. If I﻿ pay taxes, I expect results or help when I need it. Now the insurance companies are bankrupting the American people and needs reform. What other area is he a socialist? I bet you have a steady job, in what field? But these neocons have bankrupt our country just to fill their pockets and control our military. Hell we owe China because of Bush and the neocons. Traitors, that's what they are, destroying us from within. TRAITORS!!!

ASentine12, why do you dislike﻿ the President of the USA? He is not a Muslim, which is not a bad thing, compared to you "good Christians" Bush ruined this country and I think there was some involvement in 9/11. But his oil company and his friends became richer. However, President Obama is trying to help the least, especially our Military families, he even excepts the agent orange claims, raise the pay and pension for the military. Also addressed the pressure of military life. U R a piece of shit

If﻿ someone broke into your house and stole everything and left you in debt, 10 months later you still haven't restored all that was loss in the robbery. Who would you blame, yourself or the person who robbed you? Well Bush robbed America, took the US into 2 wars, most if not all of his friends became extra millionairs, he told us to our faces, take it and shut up. Then quitely walked away, while Cheney and daughter came out of his bunker to tell more lies defending their told lies.

That's what liars do....
Misinform, mislead, muttle the facts, cloud the water, assimilate a belief by associating things in speech...and so on...double speak...he didn't﻿ introduce it to us, but in the past it was simply a congressional tactic...
Now we get it from the white house...which is fine...
But don't lie about it, admit you do it and let it be what it is...

Actually, even better than Bush...in fact, in my young life more than any other president...
1. No lobbyists in my administration, hired 14 so far.
2. New transparency + posting bills for 5 days on internet prior to a vote, but they pass them in one morning and never posted any of them Stimulus etc..
3. New Bipartisanship, oh, 60 dumocrats + 1 republicant is bipartisan...really?
4. New accountability...he nominated 7﻿ people that hadn't paid taxes or had history of corruption, 3 stepped down

He's a good president because he's smarter than Bush
The man has courage to volunteer to even attempt to get America out of the hell hole it's in
Least you guys can do is﻿ give an ounce of respect to the man

Dear taysirk, I think it's funny﻿ that liberals say they want to be open and accepting, but whenever anybody says anything to oppose the left they get called: stupid, racist, and are frequently the punchline of many ridiculous jokes such as the one that you posted. That's funny!

he really hasnt been in office long enough for people to be judging if hes doing a good or bad job. give it a year then form an opinion. also, i think its disappointing people keep making jabs at﻿ the republican party and what a fuck up it is. that doesn't help anyone and it doesnt improve the relationship between republicans and democrats. we should be working together, we're all americans. and look at the past as a mistake to learn from, instead of dwelling on it. thats the only way to evolve

blaming republicans for all of our problems won't help though. the point is to learn from mistakes in the past and move on...not to constantly reflect on things that we can't change. how would we evolve otherwise? you may think bush was an idiot, but he was president for 8 years and nothing will change that...and theres no sense in being angry about it now. not to say your comment was out of line,﻿ just throwing it out there

How many racist red state living white people do you think voted against him because he was black . I heard plenty stories of people say I won't vote for the n word . How did he win he took it to the net he had a great ground game he﻿ took citizens who never voted and made them voters. And it didn't help that mccain had Palin and his all white Rallys that's not america next!!

Our country is going to rise again you can't expect 8 years of failure to be corrected in 10 months ! Healthcare is near reform something no all presidents before him tried none of them accomplished this . He is just starting so ALL YOU PARTY OF NO PEOPLE KEEP SAYING NO !

Point is Obama's communist healthcare is against the constitutional. No one should be forced to buy healthcare. If you use the analogy of auto insurance its bogus. Its a privilege to drive a car. You have a constitutional right to life. Big difference.

Other countries are far more advance then us in healthcare we are just behind them like we are in so many other things and it this is why .

Listen spook it's typical for you not to respond to my points. I get it. If you feel other countries are so much futher advanced. Move. I believe this is without a doubt the greatest nation﻿ on earth. You along with you kooks do not like America. So you have you leader Obama do an apology tour. Let me make it simple. LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT!!

But surely an non- American president is the very best choice for genocidal eugenics programs against the US citizens. It's all a matter of﻿ perspective. It's not like Obama will be killing his own.
The elites behind him already hate our guts anyway and have been trying to poison and sterilize us for yonks, but like cockroaches we are still around - but not for long.

He isn't even a year into office yet.....it's too early to start pushing him away. And this whole racism crap is BS! I am white and sooooo tired of these sooo "Clean cut" white racist people. Barack Obama is a good man with good intensions. Just give him some more time. Not everyone is "Perfect"

Democracy means that if the majority of the government is﻿ owned by off shore genocidal eugenicists, then the government is going to kill you.
Likely means are deadly vaccinations to counter laboratory created influenza and also martial law and concentration camps.
World opinion is the stupid yanks deserve their fate, because they're the dumbest!

It's merely ethnic cleansing with a racist president at the helm.
But remember it's good for the Earth. There are simply too many important and influential people who are sick of you brain-dead useless eaters who cannot even string a proper sentence together to save your life.
Of course﻿ it's conspiracy theory and will become conspiracy myth when you're all dead. Just like how the holocaust never happened.

Obama, being a disciple of Saul Alinsky, acts like a nice guy, but he's a political warmonger. He's been very clear about that.
Obama said "if they bring a knife to a fight,﻿ we bring a gun."
That's the language of gang war; the words of a Chicago thug.
Some of you need to put down the KoolAid and smell the bullshit.
And now one of Alinsky's tactics, calling anyone "racist" who disagrees with Obama's policies, is being used to the max.
Time to get to work on the 2010 and 2012 elections.

Nobody voted for that bastard; the vote was rigged. Tell me something smartass, why is it that the only state that experienced complications just happened﻿ to be the one state where his brother was governor? Why did he still win after it was revealed that Gore actually won the popular vote? Why did democrats win so overwhelmingly in the congressional elections of 2006 and the presidential election of 2008 but Bush somehow miraculously won in 2004? RIGGED!!

your first mistake was saying obama is an "overall" good president. there went any credibility you hoped for. the minute you say that tells me you like free handouts without working for it. you﻿ would rather sit on your ass and complain when you dont recieve the same treatment as me or anyone else around you that actually works for a living.

this election (obama 08) will go down as the most embarrasing and pitiful moment in American history. over 100 million people did not see what was in front of them. becuase mtv told them too, because all the media is now democratic-biased because of the Iraq war. 100 million people single-handily voted for him just because of the unpopular war in Iraq. We (not me cuz i saw it) failed as a country too see that﻿ democrats are becoming socialists. i honest wish george bush was still president.

Actually he might be kicked out of the white house. The voting was mixed up because the black panther gang, an african american gang forced thousands to vote like homeless people. The got homeless people ID's﻿ and everything and it can count as false and all that. Obama barely won the polls so mccain was suppose to win basically.

Obama's approval ratings are dropping faster than any president in recent history. Zogby has him at 42% right now. That's lower than even Jimmy Carter at﻿ the same point in their presidencies.
Socialism in the US does not work. Americans are realizing this and even democrats are starting to question Obama's policies.

Ha uknoww4343 you make me laugh! If i was of black heritage, would I be making fun of my own race? I thought not... Besides I didn't really mean what I said, my friend made a bet with me that if I can start an internet fight (including swearing), I would win 10 bucks lol... Sadly enough for my friend, he lost 10 bucks. He only bet with﻿ me because he knew that the youtube community was smarter than this, that they would just ignore a comment like mine. And you sir have just proven him wrong! nice

All American Citizens have a birth certificate.
Yes Barak Obama is an American Citizen.
But not all American Citizens WITH birth certificates are NATURALIZED CITIZENS.
One parent is not an American Citizen therefore this birth﻿ certificate slinging american citizen is not a naturalized citizen and therefore the constitution says he can't be the president of the united states.

He's not the president...
You have to be a naturalized citizen of America to be president..
That means both parents had to be American Citizens when he was born..
His dad never was or has been an American Citizen... Fact he's been to America once for a coupld days....
So american citizenship requires only one American parent-but﻿ that does not qualify for presidency...

I think the republicans are quite desperate, do they have a candidate of their own﻿ the next election? And liberalism is not communism

If one understands that socialism is not a share - the- wealth program, but is in reality a method of consolidate and control the wealth, then the seeming paradox of super-rich men promoting socialism becomes no paradox at all. Instead, it becomes logical, even the perfect tool of power-seeking megalomaniacs. Communism, or more accurately socialism, is not﻿ a movement of the downtrodden masses, but of the economic elite.
The late Gary Allen

This guy is a freakin moron. The whole problem with health care is it`s not put on the open market, there is no competition whatsoever because of government regulations. Can you imagine health care companies having to compete? If you were turned﻿ down for coverage the competing companies would exploit the hell out of that, no company would DARE do it! It would be like car insurance is now. 20 billion commercials for Geico and Prudential, but this stupid schmuck would rather be paid off.

Actually.. I wasn't referring to everyone who dislikes our President a racist...not at all actually.. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions.. I have mine.. I was just referring to the massive amount of people who have referred to him as the n word in posts.... As for my rant, I realize it sounded harsher than i intended... All i was saying was that Obama is reversing Bush's﻿ policies and i think it's a good change...

Fair enough...
I have no patience for those that use that word or are confused﻿ about whether race should be even a consideration also...
as to the bush reversal...well..since obama is funding Brazil's efforts to drill off shore, it makes perfect sense that he would reverse bush's position that we should drill off our shores.

I never realized﻿ that Youtube was full of so many racist, uneducated, ignorant people who ignore the issues at hand. Oh wait. It's kind of obvious. It's not even been a year yet and you people bash the leader of our nation. You'll see. You ignorant people are so scared of changes that will benefit our country because we've been living in a conservative hole for the past 40 years. But Obama will make this country worth living in. For now, I'm personally ok with him reversing Bush's flaws here.

The very basic proposal of the right the last 30 years is that all government is bad, taxes are bad, we have too much rules, and that "you can do things by yourself better﻿ than the government." It turns out that they have hold government at least twice as much as Dems and made government worse promoting military interventions, imperialism and extreme eoonomic deficits and stratospheric national debt reinforcing in the people the intuitive idea that all government is "bad on its roots".

He's been in office 200 days. 150 days of which have been spent cleaning up the mess from the former president, historians coin as the 37th worst president in history.
How is he a terrible president? How is bringing the country down? These arguements don't make any sense and make people who argue them look like zombies of Fox News.
I know its tough for some to have a black﻿ man as the president, but it'll be alright. We're not the first nor will we be the last.

Dont help the republicans any,﻿ just keep on slandering and keep on going, just like all the rpublicans, not smart enough to just bite the bullet shut your yappers and start trying to help them selvs instead of hurring others.

hahaha so true so true... today he gave that speech on health care﻿ reform and really all he told the people were lies. and the nice audience chanted their nice slogan "yes we can" as in "yes we can understand lies, yes we can be controlled, so obama please control us" it makes me sick.
but thankfully there are a lot of angry people out there and we'll beat this!~

no no no no no ... I'm just repeating what you're saying about Obama creating jobs. I don't want him or the government to create anything. I wanted the jobs that existed already to continue, not be destroyed by this jackass and his policies. I, along with millions of other﻿ Americans don't want bigger government.

So you would like﻿ to stay in a smaller goverment in an ever expanding time. We need entrepenures and we need lowincom families to have a better chance to get up on there feet, most ppl dont get out of hischool wanting cologe then realizing that they need it but so not in the right position to get into cologe, i think that anyone who thinks that he hasnt gotten anything done is retarted (not you) so far i'm only dissapointed with the band on stemcell resarch.... personal reasons.

Last time I checked, we live in the USA, where there is Freedom of Speech. Everyone has the right to question Obama, Congress, the Senate and to disagree w/them. THEY work for US! Where were you when Bush was crucified?!? Or is it a double standard here? What's good for the goose, is good for the gander!

So hows that hope and change working out for you?
We could have﻿ had a hero but we ended up with a zero. Way to go OBAMATRONS
Hope = Appeasement and negaotiation with crazy people is a great solution.
Change = Higher taxes and social engineering makes a stronger America.
We shall overcome Obamunism because social engineering always fails in America
I give your President the same respect you gave my President OBAMA SUCKS AND SO DO YOU IF YOU VOTED FOR HIM ASSHOLE!

well i agree with you on the fact that obama sucks, but the people who voted for him don't really matter. like stalin said "the people who vote decide nothing. the﻿ people who count the votes decide everything" our votes didn't matter in the presidential elections following year 1913. the presidents are put there by the powers behind government. and when a good president comes to power by mistake, they go ahead and kill him.

and if obama is shot this will be engineered by the powers too, so that they will blame the truthseekers and the people who don't agree with obama's policies. and there goes our revolution... don't be fooled people. read between the lines and stop believing the deceiver (obama). this man tells us one thing and his administration another. and guess what? he doesn't care about us! he cares about his administration and the businesses and the corporations he bailed﻿ out with our money!~

Lets say Obama himself opened up a government run facility/plant that would hire 1000 workers to build new, advanced cars that waiste less fuel. And that facility was the equivelant of GENERAL MOTORS. That would be considered SOCIALISM. Unstead what he is dong is giving private businesses TAX CUTS in return for creating more jobs. THATS NOT SOCIALISM. However right now, tax cuts or no tax cuts, private companies r not hiring because their product is not﻿ selling. PPL r cutting back on buying.

Other than that Hippie chick, HIS HANDS ARE TIED. In a capitalism economy, he can't create private jobs. He can invest in alternative energy and down the road with advanced technology, some private﻿ company can hire masses of emplyees to work in plants to make new cars or whatever it is.

ATLEAST﻿ at the very least when all is said and done, we can point to the positive aspects of Obama:
1. He has a nice white bright smile, and he has some stunning dimples as well to go along with them.
2. He has a nice skin tone. Not to black for America, but just black enough to say "im different".
3.He has plenty of witty jokes to entertain us with.
4. He is way cooler than any other president in the HISTORY of the USA. WE GOT THE COOLEST GUY FOR THE JOB WOOHOO.
5. he can speak like a snob.

Our ancestors would laugh in our faces if they knew that we let a man﻿ like this get elected president of the most powerful country in the world.
It's sad how ignorant America is, they think they have a president who is out to help 'save' America, when he is out to destroy America as we know it. and replace it with a country that is similair to europe (which is where our ancestors LEFT to CREATE AMERICA).
my guess is that He will be looked back on as one of the worst presidents in USA history

It's true, what Barack told Michelle on their wedding night: I'm an arrogant, lying, two-faced, power-mad, tax-and-spend, socialist﻿ son of a bitch. So there!

No, Obama will win again because apparently he can do no wrong. He's supported by what's nothing more than a State run media. ABC,﻿ NBC, CBS, PBS, NPR and others are simply all elite liberals who WILL not let him fail. Geezuz H. Christ on a crutch... just look at all of these ridiculous "WE know what's right for America" liberals all gathered in one place...
America needs a fiscally responsible leader.. NOT a lying Socialist with an agenda... What a fucking joke he is..

Obama should stop campaigning and do something OTHER than put us deeper in debt and damage the economy. "Hope and change, hope and change, hope and change, hope and change, hope and change." It's all talk. He has no idea what he's doing. I could do a better job than this guy! I don't dislike him personally, he just isn't fit to lead the United States. I was no fan﻿ of McCain, but he would have done better than this. I'm hoping for Romney to run again in 2012.

Actually, the proper term for Obama's ethnicity is bi-racial, or more specifically mulato. His mother is White, so he can't correctly be called Black. Besides, race really doesn't matter. I don't like Mr. Obama's policies because they aren't effective on a large scale, so I won't "learn to love it". If he starts doing a better job I'll change my mind, but until then I﻿ don't support him or his policies.

His mother is White, so he is bi-racial. If a Vietnamese person was accepted by Latinos as "one of their own",﻿ it wouldn't make him Latino. Opinion doesn't change biology. And when the fuck did I say I wanted another term for Bush? I think he did better than Obama has done, but that really isn't saying much.

Get things done? What exactly did he get done chief? Generalizing unstead of being specific further makes you look like the dweeb I already said you were.

Bush had his chance at office..and for all intents and purposes..he failed..wether u like it or not is up to u...But its time to give Obama his shot at office..and see wat he can do with his position..its bein less than a year and ur already counting him out..unbelievable

Obama's﻿ stimulus had nothing to do with job loss, it's private jobs. What the stimulus did do is prevent Police officers from getting laid off as well, not just extend unemployment benefits for those who lost jobs. THAT'S A GOOD THING IN MY BOOK.

cupocity303:
I don't know where you live, but police officers are getting laid off. So are firemen, doctors, nurses, dentists ... and these are professionals! Imagine the little people, for God's sakes. Obama promised that with the stimulus, jobs would be created ... NEWSFLASH ... NOT. He also promised that unemployment wouldn't go higher than 8% ... HEELLOOOO...It's almost at 10% and there are predictions that﻿ it will go higher. Wake up, man...Obama doesn't know what the heck he's doing.

I live in﻿ KY and plenty of officers here got to stay on duty because of the stimulus. Second, how is he supposed to create jobs this fast? PRIVATE JOBS? People complain that he got involved with General Motors for christ sake, saying it's socialism, and he supposed to create private non-government jobs???? It's only been 6 months and the stimulus still hasnt kicked in all the way. If he does create jobs, it will be construction, rebuilding roads & bridges, and long term, alternative energy jobs.

Then he shouldn't have promised what he couldn't deliver. And if he does create all those construction, roads, bridges, etc. jobs, as you say ... where will that leave the millions of people who never worked in that type of job? Like ... you know ... women, older people, younger people, professionals, ME? There are MILLIONS of people who lost there jobs. I'm sorry, but be has made a mess of things﻿ and he IS trying to lead this country into socialism ... mark my words.

You're contradicting yourself and you dont even see it. You say socialism yet you blame him for not creating jobs that people like u are qualified for. WELL IF HE DID CREATE﻿ JOBS FOR PPL LIKE U, THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED SOCIALISM. Anything beyond government funded construction jobs, firemen, policement, FBI etc,. is PRIVATE SECTOR. He involves himself into the PRIVATE SECTOR, and thats considered socialism. Government involving itself in private businesses is SOCIALISM. what job r u lookin for?

Obama has been given﻿ a chance, and look what he's done with it. Is this "The Change we can count on?" Gimme a break. Hey ... I would rather have Bush, with all the mistakes he made, as President than this inexperienced, radical, arrogant, lying, deceitful nimwit. His polls are steadily getting lower and lower ... the American people are waking up ... and it's about time!

I will take Bush's $1Trill﻿ deficit over Obama's $12 Trill (in just 9 months!) This is what this GENIUS spends YOUR tax $ on:1) $5 bill for ACORN 2) $500,000 for dog parks 3) $4.5mill for butterfly gardens4) $6 mill for water slides5) $1 mill for a frisbee golf course6) $87 mill for a polar icebreaking ship7) $150 mill for producers of livestock, honeybees, and farm-raised fish. Shall I go on? Is this specific enough for you? If not, let know ... I can go on & on.

"speeches" - the American education system has failed you miserably, and that is why Obama is trying to﻿ fix it so ignorant drop-outs like yourself can write basic English, and maybe attempt to get into prestigious schools such as Harvard and Columbia Universities.

There is nothing he can do, anything he does will only play into Ahmads tactic of blaming the US for everything. Right now they've run out﻿ of people to blame, they supposedly arrested the
"foreign influence" who "started" it.(the British Embassy employee) yet the protests continue, anything from Obama will simply cause Ahmad to start up his "Velvet Revolution" conspiracy theory again. Best thing the US government can do is stay out of it .

Obama has turned out to be a poor leader. He and the real 'Obama Girl', Grandma Pelosi, are rushing a terrible healthcare bill through Congress for no other reason than 'change'. In the press conference yesterday, he basically told a caller that he didn't know what was in﻿ the bill.... nobody has read it.
Note: the Obama hypocrite voted against healthcare reform when he was in the Senate.

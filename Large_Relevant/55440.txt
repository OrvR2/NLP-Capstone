	One month after the Sandy Hook school shootings, the list of victims continues to grow. One man, Gene Rosen — who found six children and a bus driver in his driveway, brought them into his home, fed them and called parents to assure them that their children were safe — has been harassed by telephone, email and online by those who think he is lying about his actions, and is part of a conspiracy.

	Rosen is not the first hero to be assaulted and insulted by conspiracy theorists with doubts. In 2002, when conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel confronted astronaut Buzz Aldrin and called him a "coward and a liar" for faking the moon landings, the 72-year-old promptly punched Sibrel in the face.

	A group called the Sandy Hook Truther movement has emerged from the dust and chaos over the past weeks to claim that the school shooting was all a staged event. Though many Americans are outraged and incredulous that anyone could doubt that the tragedy even happened, the Sandy Hook school shootings follow classic conspiracy thinking. Here are a few reasons why.

Poignant political implications

	Shootings — even child murders — happen every day, several times a day, in America. According to UNICEF, America has the worst record of child abuse and homicide in the industrialized world, with an average of 27 children killed every week by their parents and caregivers. But those child murders don't have implications for enacting a national policy on gun control.

	Most events producing conspiracy theories have important social and political implications, and the Sandy Hook shootings are no exception. No one, regardless of what side of the gun control issue they are on, can deny that guns played a key role in the Sandy Hook killings. So the conspiracy theorists must instead challenge the claim that the attack even occurred. They believe it's all a hoax to scare people into supporting more gun control and a step toward an outright repeal of the Second Amendment. [5 Milestones in Gun Control History]

'Holes' in the 'official story'

	A common theme running through conspiracy thinking is that if you're smart enough, and just look closely enough at all the news coverage and available information, you can see lies and contradictions in accounts of the event. Truthers claim that they have found "absolute proof" that the shootings were a hoax, pointing to a 6-year-old girl named Emilie Parker, who was shot to death in the school massacre.

	Or was she? They claim that the smoking-gun photographic proof that Emilie is still alive is that she was photographed after the shooting with President Obama during a visit with the families. The girl is actually Emilie's sister, wearing the same dress that Emilie wore in another photograph.

	In the topsy-turvy world of conspiracy thinking, any little girl who resembles Emilie and is wearing the same dress as one she owned must be her. It could not possibly be her sister, who could not possibly be wearing either Emilie's dress or an identical one. Instead, it's obviously proof that the whole shooting was faked.

	But this claim, even if it were true, raises more questions than it answers. For example, if Sandy Hook was indeed a "staged event" as claimed, with Emilie Parker alive and the president part of the conspiracy, why would the government be so careless as to release a photograph of Emilie, knowing that she had been reported dead in a carefully orchestrated national hoax? Is a widely published photo opportunity with the president of the United States really the best place to hide someone who is supposedly dead?

	Conspiracy theorist websites offer dozens of other examples and pieces of evidence, ranging from real or perceived contradictions in eyewitness accounts to conflicting news reports. And indeed there are some contradictions. [The 10 Most Bizarre Conspiracy Theories]

The minds of conspiracy theorists

	But what the conspiratorial mind sees as misinformation and lies, others see as merely perfectly ordinary incomplete and inaccurate information following a multifaceted tragedy. Especially in the hours and first days after such a chaotic and horrifying event, witnesses can be confused and mistaken. Police officers and reporters can misspeak, or be given incorrect information.

	Not every single statement about what occurred, from dozens of different people in different places at different times, will agree in every detail. Three different witnesses to a minor car accident will often give three slightly different accounts of what they saw, so it's unrealistic to expect dozens of people who were involved in a chaotic school massacre to report exactly the same things.

	Part of the reason that conspiracy theories linger is that any contradictory evidence — no matter how conclusive or compelling — can just be dismissed by claiming that it's part of the cover-up. There is ultimately no evidence that would satisfy most conspiracy theorists. Those who distrust the government will use any excuse to support their beliefs, logical or not. Conspiracy theorists prefer complex mysteries over simple truths, and find mystery where none exists.

	Research has shown not only that a person who believes in one conspiracy theory is likely to support others, but also contradictions don't deter conspiracy theorists.

	The idea that the Sandy Hook massacre was faked is not only absurd, but also an insult to the victims of the tragedy. The victims are really, provably gone; they are not safely hidden away somewhere until the Sandy Hook shooting has served its ultimate goal of taking away America's guns. The bullet holes are there. The children and adults are dead. Toxic conspiracies, however, will live on.

For example, people who claim to "believe" that the Sandy Hook massacre was planned and carried out by 27 different secret Government agencies might also claim to "believe" that the massacre never happened at all.

There will always be conspiracy theories because conspiracies are such a PROFITABLE industry. There's huge money to be made by PRETENDING to believe something - just look at the 9/11 "truther" and the Obama "birther" groups.

Thank you for that information. Yahoo, in and of itself, is not a source of news that I have come to trust. This whole explaination from this writer was immediately suspect to me given that he used distraction tactics and never really answered any of the glaring questions. He used character assassination of conspiracy theorists as his argument which is quite typical of those that merely wish to use naivity to disuade people from asking questions. This tactic is often used by those that wish to cover up truth instead of addressing fact.

Anyone notice the little video that they have just under the pic of the little boy on his riding toy? It says "Video: Sandy Hook conspiracy theory tests limits of free speech...". I was wondering if there was a limit to free speech. I have checked into court ruling after court ruling on this subject and can only find one limit. Everything from hate speech down to freedom of religion is protected by this save one thing, you cannot incite people to violence. That is the only limit. It is specific to someone calling people to violence, not saying something that causes people to react violently but actually telling people to commit acts of violence. Asking questions about this incident has no limits no matter what the government watchdog media says. When I was a child, reporters investigated and were very suspicious of anyone in government. ANYONE!!! not just the GOP. Today, almost every news outlet has been purchased by a family known to be running the government behind the scenes. The Rockefellers comes to minds as one. They own at least 2 large media groups and their family is very involved with those in government. These 2 things mixed are cause for alarm in and of itself.

I have no doubt that children and adults lost their lives at Sandy Hook. As I sat here and read this story from "Yahoo! News", I was left with that same old feeling of not being satisfied with the answers presented here. The guy that wrote this story did exactly the same distraction tactics that you see any time there is a cover up. You make those questioning the official reports out to look like nut jobs but never really answer the questions. Such as, why didn't Rosen call the police when the children told him that their teacher had just been shot instead of playing with them in his house for over a half of an hour? Why did the bus driver leave the children at his house (a total stranger)  when rescue workers were at the fire station less than 100 yards away? Who were the 4 men seen leaving the school by multiple witnesses immediately after the shootings? 2 got into a van and were stopped by the police (the official report stated that they had nothing to do with it but never said who they were, why they were leaving the school right after a mass murder, why they were wearing dark tactical clothing and why they were at the school in the first place). One of the men seen running into the woods was captured by the police. In one report, it stated that this was the father of one of the kids in the school and he was coming from the high school to the grade school so that he and his child could make gingerbread men. The report stated that he was the AD of the high school. This man was seen running from the school right after the shooting wearing cammy pants and a dark jacket. When he was captured, he was led right by a row of parents and was heard telling them that he did not do it. No one had ever seen this man before. One of the witnesses was giving an interview on TV and said "they have him in the police car right there" and points to the squad car. THE CAMERA NEVER PANS OVER TO THE SQUAD CAR. What reporter does not want to get a shot at all of those involved? Has anyone ever not seen a mob of reporters go after getting a picture of someone in a murder case? Not me. The official report states that this was an officer from another jurisdiction. WHAT?? How did he get there so fast? These four were seen leaving IMMEDIATELY after the shootings so how did they get there so fast from somewhere else? Another question, what school district allows their faculty to wear camofluaged clothing during school sessions? These questions are not being asked by just kooks. Mike Powers, a professional investigator and former military intelligence investigator, started recording everything as soon as it was being announced. When he and his team got done compiling the information, they came forward. You can listen to a lengthy interview on The Power Hour with Joyce Riley. Yahoo is not known for being unbiased nor for reporting truth. Again, I have no doubt that children and adults died that day. I do have a problem with believing that a 120 pound mental case took hundreds of rounds into a secure building and murdered those people without having any experience in military tactics. And one more thing, why was FEMA just down the road practicing this very scenario? Same with Aurora, same with 911. Sorry, this article furthers my questioning.

Much of it boils down to distrust of the government and the media.

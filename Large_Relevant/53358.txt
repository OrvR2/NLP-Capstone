Blog Posts by Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Texas judge warns of possible ‘civil war’ if President Obama is re-electedBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Wed, Aug 22, 2012Tweet0

What is it about election years?
As if the negative political ads aren't enough, now a county judge in Lubbock, Texas, predicts possible "civil war" if President Obama is re-elected.
Judge Tom Head was on a local TV news show making his case for a tax increase, when he said hiring extra sheriff's deputies would especially be needed if Obama wins in November.
From Lubbock's Fox 34 News:

"He's going to try to hand over the sovereignty of the United States to the U.N., and what is going to happen when that happens?," Head asked.
"I'm thinking the worst. Civil unrest, civil disobedience, civil war maybe. And we're not just talking a few riots here and demonstrations, we're talking Lexington, Concord, take up arms and get rid of the guy.
"Now what's going to happen if we do that, if the public decides to do that? He's going to send in U.N. troops. I don't want 'em in Lubbock County. OK. So I'm going to stand in front of their armored personnel carrier and say 'you're not coming in here'.

Man finds historic Martin Luther King Jr. audiotape in atticBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Wed, Aug 22, 2012Tweet0

A Tennessee man digging through forgotten boxes in his father's attic discovered an unheard audio interview recorded with civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. nearly 52 years ago.
"No words can describe. I couldn't believe it," Stephon Tull told The Associated Press. "I found ... a lost part of history."
On the reel-to-reel tape recorded on Dec. 21, 1960, King talks about a recent trip to Africa, defines nonviolence and discusses the growing civil rights movement.
"I am convinced that when the history books are written in future years, historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epochs of our heritage," King says on the tape.
Tull's father, who is now in his 80s and under hospice care, interviewed King in Chattanooga for a memoir he planned to write about racism. The book went unfinished, but the King interview and other research materials were stowed away in his attic, where his son found them a few months ago.
The recording was made four years before

Drought’s impact on food prices could worsen hunger in AmericaBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Tue, Aug 21, 2012Tweet0

[Updated at 12:10 p.m. ET]
More than 18 percent of Americans say there have been times this year when they couldn't afford the food they needed, according to a Gallup poll released on Tuesday.
That plight could grow because of the country's worst drought in half a century. The U.S. Department of Agriculture warned last month that Americans should expect to pay 3 to 5 percent more for groceries next year because of the drought.
"While Americans are no more likely to struggle to afford food thus far in 2012 than in the past, more residents may face problems as the drought-related crop damage results in a shortage of inputs in the food supply and begins to affect retail prices," the Gallup report stated.
The Gallup findings come from telephone surveys conducted with 177,662 U.S. adults from January through June 2012. They asked 1,000 Americans each day if there have been times in the past 12 months when they did not have enough money to buy food that they or their families needed.

West Nile aerial attack creates controversy in virus-stricken DallasBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Fri, Aug 17, 2012Tweet0

DALLAS — On a cooler-than-usual Texas night, Macie Mills wasn't about to let a war on West Nile virus invade her patio time outside a local coffeehouse.
"I grew up with crop dusters in West Texas," Mills scoffed while curled up in a comfy chair.
Minutes later she and a friend watched a small twin-engine plane buzz over a hotel and a popular shopping center. From 300 feet, it dispensed an invisible fine mist of pesticides designed to attract and kill West Nile virus-carrying mosquitoes.
Certainly not the renegade dusting of fields Mills remembers from back home, but the stakes are higher in the country's ninth-largest city full of freeways and tall buildings.
"Aerially spraying from a fixed-wing aircraft over cities at night is dangerous and only called upon if conditions are right and the health situation demands it," Joseph Conlon with the American Mosquito Control Association told Yahoo! News.
Dallas is suffering from the nation's deadliest outbreak of West Nile virus this year. Ten

Judge accused of creating ‘unusual shroud of secrecy’ in movie theater shooting caseBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Thu, Aug 9, 2012Tweet0
James Holmes' jail booking report (Click on image to read the entire document.)
The former grad student charged in last month's deadly shooting rampage at a Colorado movie theater gave his religion as "agnostic" and his occupation as "laborer" when he was booked into jail, according to a document released to Yahoo News this week.
The Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office booking report provides few other details about James Eagan Holmes or his motive for allegedly opening fire during a midnight showing of "The Dark Knight Rises." Twelve people were killed and 58 wounded.
The 24-year-old suspected gunman gave jailers his mother's name as an emergency contact.
The redacted two-page report was obtained by Yahoo News under a Colorado public records request. A request for additional records was denied.

"In weighing the public interests versus the private interests, the public interest would not be served by disclosing additional records," Arapahoe County Sheriff J. Grayson Robinson wrote in a response to Yahoo News.
"Mr. Holmes could potentially be significantly impacted by the release of his records and any corresponding publicity," he continued.
Robinson said part of his decision was based on a pretrial gag order issued by Chief District Judge William Sylvester.
The judge's order to seal all records related to Holmes' arrest will be debated in court Thursday. Several media organizations have asked Sylvester to scale back his order barring the release of search warrants, inventories of evidence and other records publicly available in criminal cases.

Accused Colorado movie theater gunman charged with multiple counts of murderBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Mon, Jul 30, 2012Tweet0
[Updated at 3:30 p.m. ET]
Prosecutors on Monday charged James Holmes with two dozen counts of first-degree murder and more than 100 other violent offenses related to the recent deadly rampage at a Colorado movie theater.
Holmes, who appeared in court with the same cartoonish orange-red hair he had at the time of the shooting, said only one word during Monday's hearing.
"Yes," he answered when asked by the judge if he waived his right to a preliminary hearing within 35 days.
Police say Holmes, 24, blasted his way through a packed movie house during a premiere showing of Batman "The Dark Knight Rises" in Aurora.
Twelve victims died in the attack, 58 others were wounded. The melee is among the worst mass shootings in modern-day American history. Prosecutors filed a total of 142 criminal charges against him, including 116 counts of attempted murder. The 24 murder counts reflect dual charges (premeditated and without remorse) by the prosecutors.
In the lengthy list of charges, the Arapahoe

[Updated at 5:10 p.m. EST]
CENTENNIAL, Colo.--James Holmes, the suspect in the Colorado theater massacre, appeared in a Colorado courtroom on Monday, three days after one of the deadliest shooting sprees in modern American history.
Arapahoe County District Court Judge William B. Sylvester advised Holmes of his Miranda rights, and said that there was probable cause to continue to hold him without bond on suspicion of first-degree murder.
Holmes, who was transported from a holding cell to the courtroom via an underground tunnel, appeared dazed. His brow furrowed. His head bobbed. His eyes opened and closed often. His hair was dyed a cartoonish orange-red. His hands and feet were shackled. He did not speak.

Seated in a jury box next to Tamara Brady, a public defender, Holmes never looked in the direction of a gallery that included victims and their advocates. Two sheriff's deputies stood watch nearby.
His  demeanor, however, angered the relatives of some of the victims of the  shooting. Some stared at him during the entire hearing, including Tom Teves, whose son, Alex, was killed in the attack. Teves watched Holmes intently, sizing him up.
"I saw the coward in court today and Alex could have wiped the floor with him without breaking a sweat," said Teves, whose son, a physical therapist, dove to protect his girlfriend. "You shot a 6-year-old. Come on give me a break. You're dressed in full combat gear, immediately surrender. Come on. Pick on some guys who know how to use guns," Teves told the AP.

The preliminary hearing lasted about 11 minutes. Holmes' next court appearance is July 30, when he is expected to be charged.
A decision on whether to seek the death penalty could be weeks or months away, District Attorney Carol Chambers  told reporters as she entered the courthouse.
"It will be a conversation we have with the victims before we make that decision," Chambers said.

President Obama offers comfort to victims of Colorado’s movie theater massacreBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Sun, Jul 22, 2012Tweet0

[Updated at 10:45 p.m. MST]
AURORA, Colo.--President Obama emerged from University Hospital here Sunday evening with a story of survival which he said should inspire everyone to focus on the miracles from Friday's mass shooting at a movie theater.
After three hours of private visits with the shooting victims and their families, Obama said his last stop in the hospital was with Allie Young, a 19-year-old woman who had been shot in the neck. She survived the attack because her 21-year-old friend, Stephanie Davies, laid by her side and applied pressure to her wound while the gunman continued his rampage.
"Allie told Stephanie she needed to run. Stephanie refused to go--instead, actually, with her other hand, called 911 on her cell phone," the president said. "Because of Stephanie's timely actions, I just had a conversation with Allie downstairs, and she is going to be fine."
He lauded their courage.
"As tragic as the circumstances of what we've seen today are, as heartbreaking as it is for the families, it's worth us spending most of our time reflecting on young Americans like Allie and Stephanie, because they represent what's best in us, and they assure us that out of this darkness a brighter day is going to come," Obama said.

AURORA, Colo.--Suspected mass killer James Holmes will make his first appearance in a Colorado court Monday morning.
Holmes, 24, was arrested early Friday shortly after allegedly opening fire inside a packed movie theater in suburban Denver. Seventy people were killed or injured. The 12 who died ranged in age from six to 51. The rampage was one of the worst in U.S. history.
It was about 15 minutes into "Dark Knight Rises" when Holmes, dressed in full combat gear, allegedly entered through an exit door carrying three guns, including a military-style rifle capable of shooting 50 to 60 rounds per minute.

Colorado church prays for suspected gunman who killed one of their ownBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Sun, Jul 22, 2012Tweet0

AURORA, Colo.--Some worshipers held their hands up to heaven. Others wiped away tears. Together, the overflow crowd in the hundreds at Colorado Community Church sang with a greater purpose than most Sundays.
"When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say, blessed be the name of the Lord," they belted out in unison.
Sunday's service was the first since a gunman opened fire at a movie theater not far from the church. Seventy people were killed or injured in the rampage. Among the 12 killed was Gordon Cowden, who attended Colorado Community Church.

Cowden, 51, had taken his two teenagers to see the midnight premiere of "Dark Knight Rises," the latest film in the Batman franchise. His children escaped the shooting spree without injury.
"Loving father, outdoorsman, and small business owner, Cowden was a true Texas gentleman that loved life and his family," his family said in a statement. "A quick-witted world traveler with a keen sense

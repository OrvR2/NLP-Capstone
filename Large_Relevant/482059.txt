Insane? You mean like how the Government's theory completely ignores the laws of physics, metallurgy and thermodynamics?
Will you even watch the video that includes hundreds of scientists and architects using science and experiments to disprove the things you believe?
Or will just again be ignorant to what is easy to find out and continue to try to insultďťż me?

don t be daft - those towers werent demo'd - theyďťż fell beacuse the planes hit them, and as everyone knows, all planes carry the stuff to make chemtrails with, and that stuff burns HOT - hot enough to melt steel where jet fuel cant.

Weren't demo'd? How then do you explain all 400,000y3 of concrete turning to dust in less than 15sec before it hits the ground?
Chem trails? You mean the white lines in the sky? That is frozen water vapor from air that has blown thruďťż the engines
So the melted steel? NIST denies this but go on. But, it can't be the fuel (as you said) or furniture b/c they are hydrocarbons meaning they burn ~800C in atmospheric pressures
Just watch the video /watch?v=hZEvA8BCoBw

no the trails arent all water vapour - a fraction is, but mostly its vapourised chemical - exact recipe unknown, but includes barium, and stuff that affects human cognition,ďťż to make the population controllable - the governments are doing this secretly, as part of a plan. anyway, when the planes crashed, they were fully loaded with the chemtrail chemical in big tanks(usually hidden at the back and front of all commercial airliners, for balance) and the stuff burns at an extremely high temp,

Honestly the subject was not right for slow mo action. Nothing much different than standard speed camera work. Did not gain anything likeďťż seeing true detail within the explosion accept for the explosions at the bottom of the towers before as they explode. Maybe some tighter close ups of the tower head or base would have given more impressive shots. Again a great attempt

@Danny Rocha, You're right! There's something at 2:30 - 2:35. It trails from the left side of the screen and speeds up towards the sky around 2:35 where the bird is. It is remarkably fast, even though it's inďťż slow-motion.

Get over it. Just because the USďťż is better than your country doesn't mean that you have to go hating on it. Though I admit it't not the best nor is it better by much.

Come on, guys. Clearly they detonated these coolingďťż stacks because Jimmy Hoffa was buried under them, and they had to hide the body. And a cool side note, there was no grassy knoll. Kennedy was shot by a guy perched up on one of those cooling towers. Gavin's clearly a member of Al Qaida, they paid him to film the towers being--ALIENS!!!!!!!!!--blown up. Black helicopters.

I watched the video and I'm not convinced. It's the same kinda tactic that the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth used against John Kerry in the '04 election. While there may not have been any real evidence to support their claims, they were able to form a strong campaign built on an intricate rhetorical platform. This video, andďťż all Truther arguments, are the same way. You have no real evidence, only conspiracy. Sure, it worked against Kerry in '04, but that was a much smaller-scale issue.

looks like WTC7. WTC1 and 2 fell, then WTC7, so if WTC7 falls like this, then you don't question the falling of 1 and 2? Of course the guys in the B levels were lying when one of them had their skin blown off in the lower B levels before the plane hit.
I mean, I clock into work every day and some of my skin gets blown off all the timeďťż in the morning. Completely normal day.

It's a very VERY expensive and rare camera he uses(The Phantom Flex)which cost over $50,000 and up (depending on what lens you want) and $3,000 dailyďťż if renting.The camera is so good,which is why Gavin goes all over the world to shoot clips instead of a film crew buying their own camera.

Tons of bad things happen all over theďťż world. Just because one bad thing is worse than the other, doesn't mean people can make jokes about it. In fact, no jokes should be made about any of these catastrophes that happened. I feel bad about what's happened in the UK and in Africa, but don't use it as an excuse to mock someone. Have a nice day. Cheers.

Its all done in the in theďťż camera itself. They record it at lets say 2k fps and the camera slows it down to a certain framerate, leys say 45fps. Thats why on some of their videos gavin quickly rushes to the camera after the awesome slow-mo part is done. Because it takes so much space up.

Well if it's cooling towers from a Nuclear Power Plant
(or was supposed to go to one) I 'd say blow em up. Nuclear energy is harming our environment. Global warming is threatening our very survival. Just yesterday here in Wisconsin, in my area, the weather was 56 degrees Fahrenheit THAT's ridiculous considering it's the middle of January and todayďťż there's a Blizzard blowing outside.

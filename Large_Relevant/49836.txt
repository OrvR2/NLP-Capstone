[Updated at 10:25 p.m. ET/8:25 p.m. MT]
CENTENNIAL, Colo.— James Holmes’ two-door hatchback was full of items indicating he might have planned to flee after allegedly shooting up an Aurora, Colo., movie theater in July.
Tire-puncturing devices, a canister of tear gas, a .40-caliber handgun, ammunition, Holmes' iPhone and various backpacks were found in the car, police testified this week.
“I do think he was thinking that he was going to get away from that movie theater,” Mary Ellen O’Toole, a former FBI profiler not associated with the case, told Yahoo News.
Prosecutors painted a picture this week of how and where Holmes allegedly executed his horrific attack. What they didn’t explain is why, or if, the suspected mastermind had plans to flee after shooting 70 moviegoers, 12 of them fatally.
Testimony from the officer who handcuffed the suspect said Holmes, clad in SWAT gear, gave up without a fight behind the movie theater moments after the massacre.
But another officer, Aurora Sgt. Gerald Jonsgaard, testified that he was at a different vantage point and had the suspect in the crosshairs of his rifle scope when Holmes threw his hands up in the air for approaching officers. "It was instant and exaggerated," Jonsgaard said. "It was like he was surprised or something like that."
A photo presented in court showed a half-dozen caltrops in the car's front seat. The low-tech, anti-personnel weapons—also known as "spike stops" or "road stars" because they can disable a car's tires—are sometimes fashioned out of nails and, when thrown or dropped, are designed to land with a sharp spike facing upward.

"They were commonly used against the cavalry and infantry," Sgt. Matthew Fyles said on the stand.
O’Toole, who worked for 15 years in the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit where she studied psychopaths and helped capture killers, also told Yahoo News that Holmes' "ability to think analytically and critically has come out in this crime scene. This sounds like to me it was a contingency plan, where if he was being chased he could throw those things out the window.”
An ATF agent testified Holmes purchased eight individual road stars online from a Washington state police and military supplier on June 6. The supplier's description of them urges extreme caution and discretion.
"Road Stars can be deployed to create instant roadblocks, stop a pursuing vehicle, prevent parked vehicles from fleeing, protect private property, etc.," the website states.
O’Toole said another telling aspect about the incident is the fact that Holmes left a sun shield in the parked car’s front window, despite it being at night.
“If you don’t think you are doing anything wrong you don’t need to hide it,” O’Toole said.
Former federal prosecutor Kimberly Priest-Johnson, who is not associated with the case, said the Arapahoe County district attorney might have sandbagged any knowledge of Holmes' getaway plan for strategic purposes.
“They didn’t necessarily need to go any further [than show the] evidence that they had and maybe draw an inference from it … i.e., he potentially had a getaway plan ... to show that this was a premeditated event,” said Priest-Johnson, who is now a defense attorney in Texas. She also noted that prosecutors had no reason to tip their hand to motive during the preliminary hearing.
“It’s probably evidence that would sound crazy to the average person just given everything else we’ve learned about what Mr. Holmes did,” she said. “And that would not necessarily help the prosecution, but that could possibly help the defense.”
O’Toole described the suspect as a mission-oriented mass murderer whose ultimate plan was foiled when his booby-trapped home didn’t explode. Investigators said he wanted his apartment to catch fire so first responders would be drawn away from the movie theater.
“We would have seen a different finale had his apartment building exploded,” O'Toole said. “The only one who knows what he was going to do at the end would be James Holmes. But with the planning that was involved in this case, I think he considered a number of options."
Late Thursday, Judge William Sylvester ruled prosecutors had shown enough probable cause this week to proceed with a trial. An arraignment is scheduled for 9 a.m. Mountain time Friday, but Holmes' public defenders have indicated they will ask for a continuance because they are not ready to enter a plea.

Holmes is being framed,  The dectivives have already changed their testimony about the ticket purchase, originally testifying Holmes purchased the ticket that night, and the ticket seller could identify him.  Then the story was changed to on-line, again under oath (because they couldn't find a ticket sekler to lie I guess)

Now the smoking gun. Corbin Dates was in the  second row from the front, fourth seat from the aisle on the right according to his interviews. He has been interviewed by several news agencies.  He has stated a "normal looking guy with a Goatee" sat in the corner seat by the exit door.  He received recieved a phone call, went to the door, motioned to someone outside to that location, and then went out and blocked the door open. This was not a guy with orange or red hair. The shooter came in shortly after. Corbin stated he'd be more than happy to testify in court.  Some of his interviews have been removed from online.  This should not happen as a matter of national security, because either Holmes did it, or he was framed by our government.  Yahoo has not even mentioned Corbin Dates or his girlfriend. Why?  Everyone following this closely has wondered how the prosecution would explain this away in court.

The jury is in! The police testified for him, according to the article I just read... and lied through their teeth once again. Heresay evidence is not acceptable, unless the truth will destroy the case I guess.  Why would Holmes attorneys not call Dates to testify if they, and allow false hearsay testimony if they were on Holmes' side.  I hope the victim's survivors are paying attention to this, because it's obvious Holmes didn't do this.  

From Article:

James Holmes Case: Witness Saw Red-Haired Man Before Shooting

January 10, 2013 12:10 PM EST 

Corbin Dates, a witness to the James Holmes incident in Colorado, told police he saw a red-haired man open the emergency exit prior to the shooting.

According to police sergeant Matthew Fyles, Dates witnessed a male in a front-row seat of Theater Nine of the Aurora Century multiplex, during the July 20 screening of the Dark Knight Rises.

Fyles testified in court Wednesday about the incident, during a hearing to determine whether to go forward with a trial in the case. His testimony about Corbin Dates is compelling, because it's actually derived from an eyewitness who was inside the building during the attack. This story was probably the most interesting tidbit to come out of this hearing this week.

Unfortunately, most of the witnesses haven't come forward to give decent interviews to the press, so there are still many questions left unanswered. There were so many conflicting accounts given in the wake of the James Holmes incident, it's difficult to know what to believe.

Either way, Dates observed a man in the front row, with red hair sticking out from under a cap or bandana, talking on his cell phone. The unidentified man, presumably Holmes, walked toward the emergency exit while still on the phone, and open the door. He kept it ajar with his foot. Dates left briefly, and when he returned the man had disappeared, Fyles testified.
_____________________________________________________________________________-
This is BS, and Fyles should go straight to jail for perjury.  Dates is no doubt being threatened by our governement.

So, he wasn't insane.  One option remains: the death penalty.  Our economy is hurting so there is no need to fund his stay on this earth.

He MAY have had a getaway plan?  He stated as much when the police arrested him.

He was hoping someone would detonate the explosives he set up in his apartment and cause a distraction for police that would allow him time to make his escape.

Of course he gave up without a fight. He's a cowardly #$%$ y and that's what they all do.

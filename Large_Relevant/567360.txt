What we need is to eliminate the gun free zones that the vast majority of mass murderers are done in. We need to allow teachers, school staff, and mature college students, who have the training and are﻿ willing to conceal carry guns to do so. And we need to increase detection and treatment for people with Mental Health issues. Also we need to investigate the affects SSRI drugs have in increasing violence and suicides.
We have many out of work Veterans that would be great guards in our schools.

Its a sorry state when little kids can't even express themselves without being attacked by the bagger brigade. The second amendment is an antiquated sentence written in 1791. Its ridiculous to assume that﻿ a sentence written over two hundred years ago is going to rule America for the rest of time. Its time for bulletheads to get a grip on reality and realize that things change. Or bulletheads will be carrying﻿ particle accelerators and vaporizing shopping malls﻿ in one hundred years or so?

What a shameless and pathetic attempt to rally people behind their cause. This just goes to show that the WH will use whatever they can to push their agenda. This is wrong on so many levels.
I feel sorry for this little﻿ girl - she's a victim of Obama's left-wing propaganda and doesn't even know it.

Not enough space/forgive brief explanation. The belief that one can force equality through rule started with Marx. Modern liberals, progressives etc. all share this core belief. That is what﻿ makes them Marxist. This belief is their flaw since trying to make a perfect society made up of nothing but imperfect humans is impossible. The end is trying to eliminate the imperfection and the imperfection is the human so, it turns into eliminating humans. It really is a hatred of what is human.

Because children have been taught to fear something by their parents is not, for me, a reason to legislate. You know,﻿ SOME children are taught to fear black people. Anyone want to make laws based on THOSE children's opinions? Anyone? Didn't think so.

We all know that a parent or teacher sat down with those children and coached them what to write. We all know you picked the ones that favored your point﻿ of view. Using kids to push what you want will not work... We the people aren't that stupid. You should fire the guy who told you to do that. Bad choice...

The beauty of people killing each other the "old fashion way" is that if someone attacked a child with a knife, they wouldn't be able to kill 20 of them before stopping. Don't you get that simple fact? Guns are a danger to society, especially automatic or semi automatic weapons. Leaving those weapons in the hands of the public is just asking for mass murders. Only﻿ an idiot﻿ wouldn't be able to see something as obvious as that

That is simply not true and you know it. There is no way a man would be able to enter a school and kill 26 people with a knife. 20 children and 6 adults for God's sake... With a knife? Are﻿ you mad?"Rambo" isn't a real person.And for all of you conspiracy nut jobs out there, let's say Sandy Hook was fake, ok. What﻿ about VTech? Binghamton? How about 13 soldiers at an Army facility for God's sake? Do you really not get it???? Only GUN MURDERS can lead to such MASS MURDERS. It's so obvious.

Not everyone died in Aurora, did they? These shooters went crazy from SSRI's, which cause extreme violence. Not everyone dies in wars either, do they. I guess that makes﻿ wars OK?

1:05 "I love my country"?? Oh my goodness if there was ever a give away that she was coached what to write, its this statement. A little 3rd grader concerned about big scary guns wouldn't﻿ have the presence of mind to make a connection to love of country unless an adult explained to her some dynamics of the debate or more likely just didn't explain anything but just told her to put that in there.
"Honey, do you love this country?"
Hinna "Yes."
"Good sweetheart. You should say that too."

Those days are gone now we have cameras almost on every corner and street light,police and advanced technology we dont need guns, only military,police,and secret service get it

If i was president only people in the Military serving and super secret service agents should be allowed to have guns. This isnt 1874 anymore, You dont need a gun to Hunt, you go to the supertmarket and buy some food, What is so great about shooting an innocent dear just to watch it die.

maybe the UK doesn't have as violent of a culture as the U.S. Guns are NOT the only problem, we﻿ need to create a culture where violence is not something that we are so desensitized to. If someone is willing to break the law to murder someone else, they certainly aren't going to stop and think, "well, I better not buy/carry this gun, because it is illegal." Your argument is elementary.

Are you plain ignorant or do you just not get it? Crime rate?They are going to take my shoes? Whatever. My wallet? Whatever. My hat? Whatever... My life along with the﻿ life of a bunch of other people? No. Guns need to go away.
Crime rate doesn't really matter when compared to mass murders. Where's the UK on that ? Hmm
Highest kills by a single person in the UK = 17 people... And oh, look it was a gun collector who killed those people WITH GUNS. What more proof do you need? I mean, really?

If that person is in jail or dead then he is not a factor. Crime rates are much more relevant than a﻿ single incident.

Reminds me of the Saddam Hussein and Hitler videos posing with the kids. Pure agenda pushing propaganda. The second amendment was not intended just to protect hunters so they can shoot a deer or a rabbit, ﻿ it was written so that citizens had weapons to protect themselves from tyranny.

Why not just get a Taser gun with a 1000 volt blast and 30 feet radius range to protect yourself from tyranny, it doesent have to be a gun. Their will be no more mistakes like treyvon martin and if their﻿ is the damage will be small cuz a taser is more effective then a gun, they go down immediately and lose all muscle control. if u shoot with a gun u might shoot him in the arm or sumthin and he uses the other arm to hold a knife to your childs throat and SLICE.

I'm not saying that an 8 year old likely wrote that letter, but when I was 13 I was in 8th grade. That's one year before high school. Writing a letter much better than that would have been no problem for me, as two years later I wrote a 10 page report on thermonuclear proliferation.
I am being completely serious when I say if you and your entire school﻿ of 13 year olds cannot write such a basic letter as that, our schools have surely failed us all, and the future of this country is doomed.

This is sickening, using children to help make his agenda more acceptable to people, why dont he bring up the twins who were protected by their grandmother with a gun when somebody broke in, or maybe get the 15 year old who protected himself and sister from a break in with his dads AR-15.
This was a cheap, tasteless move on﻿ the Obama administrations part they should be ashamed of their selves.
Although, Hitler did use kids as good PR to further his agenda...so maybe Obama saw his success there

Regarding the national gun-control agenda i~ mandatory background checks for all gun buyers. A ban on assault weapons﻿ and high-capacity ammunition clips. More money for mental health. Stronger enforcement of the laws currently on the books. It took a horrifying, unthinkable tragedy to put guns back on the agenda. Finally a real chance to put some sanity into America's gun laws.

How dare you employ children in your bullshit campaign to strip Americans of their rights. I wouldn't be surprised if your on television with them﻿ next, holding them, crying and asking "why one more innocent child? we need to take away rights to save them!"
No. there are more practical ways of protecting our kids than suggesting what you (Obama) want to do. How DARE you put strings on these children and manipulate them. What a sack of shit.
I voted Gary Johnson for a reason.

Um... banning abortion as you are suggesting is just as bad as gun control and the drug war. They're all ways of letting the government make decisions for you. Also, because an﻿ embryo is not a child, abortion is not killing a child. If you want to make it illegal so bad, why don't you pay to raise all the kids? What's that? You don't want to? Didn't think so.

How about a video of the Georgia house wife standing alongside her two children, and have the children read a letter thanking their mom for shooting the robber armed with a crowbar, and saving their lives? Gun control advocates, liberals, and Democrats﻿ would be screaming "how dare gun owners use children as props!!!"

People can say, that it is wrong to use children in order to propogate change﻿ within a society. But I ask you this: when the culture of violence we are born into permeates our every nuance, what do we do? How do we begin, when we as a people divide ourselves over everything, to begin to solve grpwing afflictions within our own shores?
If we as a people, cannot accept and adapt to the problems we ourselves give rise to, than our time as a world power is fading fast.

Well, if we're going to be using the ideas of children to fix the world, let's see if the boys and girls of Obama's America can put forth some other common sense measures on how to prevent wars, how to balance the budget of the nation, and how to fill﻿ the potholes in America's roads more efficiently.

Sorry , but I'm a Democrat and this using children as a political prop is not okay
Sen Reid himself is an NRA member and full supporter of﻿ the 2nd Amendment. This isn't a partisan issue . It's our rights versus a political attempt to diminish them.

There are over 311M people in America. The majority don’t support the N.R.A. Most gun owners believe the N.R.A. is an antiquated organization with the only goal, to enrich gun manufacturers at our expense. The gun industry and other large corporate and individual donors chipped in $71.1 million in 2011 to NRA coffers, compared with $46.3 million in 2004, according to a Bloomberg News review of NRA tax returns. – NRA Gun Control Crusade Reflects Firearms﻿ Industry Financial Ties.

 Looks like President Obama was right when he said the majority of Americans support universal background checks for gun buyers—in a huge way. A whopping 90% of the public supports the idea, according to a new New York Times/CBS News poll, including 95% of Independents, 93% of Democrats, and﻿ 89% of Republicans. Even NRA members overwhelmingly supported the idea. Overall, only 7% said they actively opposed background checks.

Phaninex is referencing a poll pushed by CNN's left wing pollster.
No one in the NRA membership forum has taken the lefty poll... It was just made up propaganda designed to confuse.
The NRA"s position has long been to register﻿ certain kinds of guns actually used by the military, not your average rifle like an AR 15

Quite frankly, I don't know anything about the finer points of this "debate", but I don't think I need to. Obama is trying to prevent gun violence, which is something I would imagine we all want.
To see nothing but angry troll posts on the PRESIDENT'S YouTube channel﻿ is horrifying. There's no intelligent debate. People aren't even trying to be polite! It's Insulting to think this is how the people in my country behave.

These videos are sick. Absolutely sick. The president and his staff should be ashamed of themselves for this stunt. They know exactly what they are doing and sadly it is effective with a portion of the population. For this president﻿ who is so esteemed by his cronies and affiliate media supporters as "intellectual," he sure uses anti-intellectual tactics incessantly. Midterm elections can't get here soon enough.

Neandertals were just as intelligent as cro-magnon. So I would not be offended to be called one. There brain case was larger than modern man.﻿ On the issue of guns, you must understand this debate is not about safety, it is about control and how much our government wants of it. The greatest mass murder in US history was done using Airplanes, the greatest school massacre with ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel (research Bath Michigan). No planes, no fertilizer, no fuel, (unless you are a monkey )

So. let's see if there was only ONE murder, your loved one, mother, father, sibling, etc that's ok? Safety is part of this debate, however the need to consider, requiring background checks, closing﻿ gun show loopholes, MUCH NEEDED. I believe President Obama was clear, limit ammo mags to 10 rounds. imo reasonable.
Control is an illusion, and not the intent, unless one suffers from paranoia.

If my loved one died due to a murder where a gun was used I would not feel the need to ban any form of gun. That newtown massacre was the fault of ONE﻿ man and no one else. Criminals will always find ways to get weapons to kill people. Laws will not change that. I personally would like for alcohol to be banned because statistically more people die to alcohol abuse than all murders annually combined due to all weapons. People do not have a constitutional right to keep, sell or buy alcohol.

Yeah, I'm going to let a child's views on gun control sway my stance on the issue. I mean, seeing as how they clearly know all the complexities surrounding the subject.﻿ Yeah right. The opinions of children on gun control contribute NOTHING to the conversation because they obviously lack the maturity and intelligence. And if they can't contribute to the conversation, the only logical remaining reason to use them is but to serve as props for a political agenda. Mr. President, you're disgusting.

First of all I'm NOT a republican, I'm a libertarian. ﻿ Second, using kids to further your political agenda on a nationally disputed issue is sick and plays on peoples emotions instead of instigating rationale debate for change and solutions.

SO we follow the UK with their rising rates of violent crime, muggings, rapes, and home invasions.
We can't follow our current course, of reduced crime rates, homicode rates, rape rates,etc.
The "common sense"﻿ course is to follow the lead of a plan that results in MORE VIOLENCE.
It isn't "wise and normal" to stay on a path resulting in less overall violence.
If you don't want more violence, you're sick and perverted, any decent person WANTS tens of thousands more rapes a year... right?

Only problem is that his measures wont stop gun crime...and﻿ thats the reason for people being upset. There has not been a major gun control law passed in nearly 20 years. Yet the FBI crime stats say that violent crime is down 50% over the past 20 years and murder is down 54%. Most educated american's know that gun control is a failed experiment. It doesnt reduce crime. But libs are in control and unrestrained now....so now, its play time with their ideas.

Americans are so childish and spoiled that opposite to all the the other most advanced societies they only﻿ know the Bill of Rights and they wipe their ass with the Bill of Responsibilities. Everything is due, they never make mistakes and the solution to a crime is to increase the number of tools to commit more crimes because everything is a rights and no duties.

Exploited? At Newtown first reports were... 4 handguns used inside school & A BUSHMASTER in the car...OUTSIDE (not used) But now that's all we hear... the bushmaster that was used at Newtown. Exploited...story changed...to demonize these black rifles. Exploited﻿ just like these kids. For their political plan. I was watching the TV reporting as it was happening. I saw the Bushmaster photoed still in the car the shooter drove.

its easy to point at the gun, but we should be pointing at the person behind it. fixing a broken leg with a band-aid won't work. we need to address the real problems.

The beauty of people killing each other the﻿ "old fashion way" is that if someone attacked a child with a knife, they wouldn't be able to kill 20 of them before stopping. Don't you get that simple fact? Guns are a danger to society, especially automatic or semi automatic weapons. Leaving those weapons in the hands of the public is just asking for mass murders. Only an idiot wouldn't be able to see something as obvious as that

Think before you speak. A determined person with a﻿ knife can kill classrooms full of kids before being stopped. In the right (or wrong) hands, a bladed weapon is just as deadly as a firearm. It's just more up close and personal.

That is simply not true and you know it. There is no way a man would be able to enter a school and kill 26 people with a knife. 20 children and 6 adults for God's sake...﻿ With a knife? Are you mad?
"Rambo" isn't a real person.
And for all of you conspiracy nut jobs out there, let's say Sandy Hook was fake, ok. What about VTech? Binghamton? How about 13 soldiers at an Army facility for God's sake? Do you really not get it???? Only GUN MURDERS can lead to such MASS MURDERS. It's so obvious.

It's shit like this shit that pisses me off. Our government 'sells' gun control to people through outlets like these. Listen, with all due respect you cannot take a child's opinion of firearms. People hear the children talking, it scares the majority into getting the mindset that these "WAR WEAPONS" must be banned, and these rifles don't belong in a 'civilized society'. BS. If you don't think we as law abiding citizens should be able to possess an﻿ AR-15 or an AK-47 (or variants) get out.

since they neither can prove what they say about obama nor can they give any sufficient reason for why obama should be responsible for their problems...they are irrelevant. but why "believing" in evolution? i handle it as well as i handle agnostics and theists: neither can i prove nor can i disprove completely that god exists - therefore it´s useless to talk about it. i neither believe that anyone has﻿ a valid concept of evolution nor for creationism...it is just a loss of time.

Typical gun nut...Even President Reagan called for an assault weapons ban in 1994, which Clinton ultimately signed. What Obama is doing is hardly unprecedented. Btw, the 2nd Amendment calls for a "well-regulated" militia.﻿ WELL-REGULATED.

So every conservative has to believe what Ronald Reagan believed? Ridiculous. Obama using executive orders-not signing a bill on﻿ gun control-IS UNPRECEDENTED. The well-regulated is up for debate, but regulations should be passed by the congress or the states, not by executive order. Also, watch the name-calling, you are painting the caricature of the typical liberal-can't win an argument or hold a discussion-name call.

The executive orders aren't﻿ new regulations. They simply enforce the laws we already have. He hasn't signed an assault weapons band or high capacity magazine ban. Those must go through Congress.

Most people think people who want to take away their guns are nuts.Let's not forget Obama signed executive orders to protect 6-7 redstate senators who are sure to lose re-election from taking more tough votes.This is the opposite of courage-there is plenty of data showing gun control doesn't work & plenty showing violence in movies & first person shooter video games increase aggression in individuals. This is all about Obama just wanted to take guns away. One gun taken﻿ away, he'll go for another

He﻿ isn't taking your guns away. Nobody is going to raid your home and confiscate your gun. He simply wants to make it more difficult to purchase one. If your background is fine and you're not a psycho, you can buy a gun. As for the assault weapons ban he favors, its common sense. Why would you need an assault weapon?

Then why did he support a gun ban in Illinois? Why did future democrat Presidential candidate Gov Cuomo say he wouldn't be opposed to going into homes & seizing guns. Assault weapons bans are not common sense, just because you perceive anyone not needing them is not justification to ban them. If you ask a Holocaust survivor, they would have been happy to have an Assault Rifle. Common sense says businesses grow when taxes﻿ are low, but Obama doesn't follow that now does he??

"Reagan made a mistake in his later years." Yeah and he also sold arms to Iranians, yet nobody calls him a fascist dictator as everyone is calling﻿ Obama now. The ban didn't increase gun violence rates, did it? It's a step in the right direction. Why do you need an assault weapon, out of curiosity?

To keep me and my children and grand children safe from government tyranny.
I also carry life insurance, have a spare tire in my car, a fire extinguisher in my home and a number of other things that I have around just in﻿ case of emergencies.
All of the mass shootings were done in gun free zones and done by people that were on mood altering drugs that should have been committed to asylums years ago even if against their will. Correct these two problems is what is needed.

She obviously has a very high IQ. Some kids are able to read, write and communicate much better than many adults. As far as exploiting I believe each of them had a parent with them that supported their child in speaking out. This happened to children so naturally children have thoughts and opinions on the topic. Obama is not the first president to invite children to political events. Bush invited children to his 2006 veto of federally-funded stem-cell research. Thanks for posting the video.

So President Obama uses "emotion" to get his agenda across ??? I thought many of the parents had actually prevented their children from watching the news?? This child states she "sat all day and watched the news??/ Didn't Hitler use children to do his deeds too??? How history repeats its self. I watch how "emotion" is used to pull at the heart strings﻿ of every American. But the one thing that hasn't been mentioned is this...Lock up your guns. Mom didn't lock up her guns.

I would like to see some equal time on this. How about letters from small children thanking﻿ their parents for not aborting them and a plea to the President and Congress to do there best to end the innocent murder of unborn, helpless babies !!! Millions of innocent female,male, minority, healthy babies are killed yearly, the numbers are far more staggering then those who are sadly killed by mentally ill indviduals.

And that has what to do with the innocent murder (abortion) of millions of female, male, minority and healthy﻿ unborn innocent babies a year in the U.S? The President is creating gun laws to supposedly reduce the murder of innocent children, reducing abortions is clearly the best method for saving innocent lives, if he is really serious about saving "even just one life".

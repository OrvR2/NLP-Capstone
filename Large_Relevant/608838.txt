The Impact of Baby Boomers Working Past 65By Dave Bernard | U.S.News & World Report LP – Fri, Jan 18, 2013

Ever since the Social Security program was created back in 1935 we have come to accept 65 as the age we can expect to retire. Many companies followed suit, and 65 was typically viewed as the end of the road for corporate careers and the trigger for pensions, gold watches, and retirement parties.
But today, reaching age 65 does not automatically mean it's time to retire. The promise of a relaxing and stress-free retirement has been replaced in many cases by the reality that people are not prepared to retire. Some employees cannot afford to retire or are just plain afraid to retire. Age 65 is now just another year in an ongoing career, and retirement has no set time frame.
The reasons people are extending their work life are varied. For some individuals it is not a matter of choice but rather survival. Many Americans do not have sufficient funds to support a retirement life, and therefore must continue to work. Other workers find the interaction and engagement with co-workers to be a major benefit of continuing their job. Many people experience a feeling of worth and self esteem resulting from the important role they play at the company. Finding such recognition outside of the working world may not be that easy.
Staying in the workforce past traditional retirement age will have broad implications for employers, younger workers, and the economy. Here's a look at how delayed retirement is likely to impact the workplace:
Younger workers may have fewer opportunities. When existing employees stay on the job longer there will be fewer opportunities available for younger workers in search of a career. In an already tight job market this could prove frustrating to younger job candidates who are forced to wait in the wings. In some cases there may be enough space for older and younger workers to work together, and both may benefit from mentoring efforts. But if there is only room for one, employers may be forced to choose between retaining an older worker and hiring a younger one.
Challenges as younger supervisors manage older workers. Not all older workers are comfortable with reporting to someone significantly younger. New bosses tend to come with new ideas and changes that can be met with resistance from the existing staff. It is important that both the older employee and the younger manager work together and learn to communicate effectively if they hope to make this situation a success. Progress will require sensitivity, building trust, and mutual respect.
Corporate culture conflicts. It is not uncommon for companies to have to reinvent themselves due to changes in the competitive landscape or economy. Long-term employees have generally adapted to the existing corporate culture, but how will they fit in if the business needs to go in a different direction? Companies need to be fast on their feet to survive and cannot afford to be slowed down unnecessarily. Older workers set in their ways can make an already difficult situation even more challenging.
In addition, older workers tend to have different motivations in the workforce. While younger employees are driven by money and the ability to rise in the corporate ranks, older workers often want more emotional rewards, such as feeling needed, learning new skills, and contributing to the common good. If you want to get the most out of employees, you need to speak their language and understand what makes them tick.
Additional costs of maintaining older workers. Health care expenses are on the rise, and older employees often cost companies more to provide coverage. But on the flip side, older workers do not have dependents because their families have largely been raised, so that cost is eliminated. But it's still not cheap to provide for the insurance needs of elderly workers.

"Younger workers may have fewer opportunities" 
Wrong....there is way more JOBs because the Older Generation had JOBS....then retired!!!!

"Additional costs of maintaining older workers" 
Wrong.....Business will adjust to the Tax and Obama Care and eliminate more benefits.... Cut Cost is the name of the Game!!!

LOL, I didn't even read the article but I can tell you what it means-older workers are holding on to jobs and that keeps the younger workforce from getting them BUT when the cost of living has gone so high people can't live, they keep working!  Right?

The youngest in our office is 56. The oldest 65. Our insurance is sky high, however, it's a small office and we've all been there for over 10 years. I suspect the boss, who is a very nice man, is waiting for the last one to be of retirement age before selling the practice....We are a bunch of lucky old folks. In this economy, even tho we all NEED to work because our 401K and SS aren't enuf for any of us, we couldn't find another job if our lives depended on it here in Vegas....except maybe as Walmart greeters.

Corporations like to dump older workers.  And once you're over 50 it's hard to find another position.

Young and old makes for a better work place. It has more to do with how many of us treat our parents or older people. We can learn a lot from those that are older. Plus I think the mind was designed to keep going. If you stop it it will stop you.

Planning to eat after you retire?

Well then, you may have to keep working, to pay for the food.

Not only is this article full of age related assumptions and stereotypes, it is definitely age discriminating.  I am a baby boomer and have always been an "agent of change" in any company I have worked in.  I always look out of the box for new ideas. I have found that the younger generation is more hidebound and look to their professor's for wisdom which is usually out of date at the time they are teaching it. People in the work force are the leaders of the new millenium.

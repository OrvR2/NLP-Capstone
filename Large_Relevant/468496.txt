New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said today that it was "disgusting" that the House adjourned without voting on a $60 billion relief package for the victims of superstorm Sandy and put the blame squarely on a fellow Republican -- House Speaker John Boehner.


Christie, who is considered a possible Republican presidential candidate four years from now, said there was "only one group to blame, the Republican Party and Speaker Boehner."


The blunt talking New Jersey governor joined a chorus of Republicans from New York and New Jersey fuming over his decision to pull the bill at the last minute.


Christie in an angry news conference decried the "selfishness and duplicity," the "palace intrigue," "the callous indifference to the people of our state."


"Unfortunately people are putting politics ahead of their responsibilities... You do the right thing. Enough with all the politics," he said.


Christie said that when it comes to natural disasters, "We respond as Americans, at least we did until last night... it was disgusting to watch."


"In our hour of desperate need, we've been left waiting for help six times longer than the victims  of Katrina with no end in sight," said Christie.  "Sixty-six days and counting, shame on you. Shame on Congress."


The governor said his four calls to Boehner Tuesday night went unanswered, but he said he spoke to the House speaker today. Christie would not disclose any details of the conversation, but clearly his anger over the no-vote was not mollified.


Following Christie's press conference Republican representatives from New York and New Jersey announced that the speaker promised a vote on the bill on Jan. 15.


"Getting critical aid to the victims of Hurricane Sandy should be the first priority in the new Congress, and that was reaffirmed today with members of the New York and New Jersey delegations," Boehner said in a statement released late this afternoon.


Rep. Peter King, R-NY, whop spent much of the day criticizing Boehner, met with the speaker this afternoon and was confident that the speaker would keep his word and hold a vote later this month and offered for the first time a reason for why the bill was pulled.


"[Boehner] said there was much confusion and so much fighting going on over the fiscal cliff bill it would be damaging to the Republican caucus" to have voted on the relief bill Tuesday night.


Lawmakers were initially told by Boehner, R-Ohio, that the relief bill would get a vote on Tuesday night following an eleventh hour vote on the fiscal cliff bill. But in an unexpected switch, Boehner refused to put the relief bill to a vote, leading to lawmakers from parties yelling on the floor of the House.


Congress historically has responded to natural disasters by promptly funding relief efforts. It took just 11 days to pass a relief package for victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  The Senate already passed its version of the bill that would replenish an emergency fund set to run out of cash next week and which will help repair subways and tunnels in New York City and rebuild parts of the New Jersey shore devastated by superstorm Sandy.


Time is particularly pressing, given that a new Congress will be sworn in Thursday. The Senate will therefore have to vote on the bill again before it comes to the House, which could be as late as February or March.


"This was a betrayal," Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y., told ABC News.com.  "It's just reprehensible. It's an indefensible error in judgment not have given relief to these people that are so devastated."


Rep. King, took the floor of the House and to the airwaves and aimed his outrage squarely at Boehner, accusing him plunging "a cruel knife in the back" of storm-ravaged residents "who don't have shelter, don't have food," he said during a House session this morning.


"This is not the United States. This should not be the Republican Party. This shouldn't not be the Republican leadership," King said on the floor of the House.


He made no attempt to hide his anger, suggesting that residents in New York and New Jersey should stop sending money to Republicans and even questioning whether he could remain a member of the party.


"Anyone who donates one cent to the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee should have their head examined," King, a staunch conservative and Republican congressman for 10 years, told CNN.


"They have written off New York and New Jersey. They've written me off…. Party loyalty, I'm over that. When your people are literally freezing in the winter… Then why should I help the Republican Party?" he added.


He said that Boehner refused to talk to Republican members from New York and New Jersey when they tried to ask him about the vote Tuesday night.


"He just decided to sneak off in the dark of night," King said.



Democrats were also outraged.


"It is truly heartless that the House will not even allow the Sandy bill to come to the floor for a vote, and Speaker Boehner should reconsider his ill advised decision," Sen. Chuck Schumer, D- N.Y., said in a statement.


October's storm was the worst natural disaster ever to hit the region, causing billions in damage and leaving 120 people dead.


More than 130,000 people are expected to make claims to the federal government, but without a funding increase only about 12,000 people  can be covered with existing funds.


"It doesn't make sense they wouldn't vote on this. There are truly people in need," said Steve Greenberg, whose home was flooded and damaged by fire in the hard-hit Breezy Point section of Queens. "Not of these people are fit to serve," he said.


Grimm said Boehner's decision fuels a perception that the Republican Party does not care about people.


"It buys into the ideology that Republicans don't care and are callous," he said.  Grimm said there were enough votes to get the bill passed and that it makes fiscal sense, because the money would go to help spur small businesses.

The House needs to re-write the bill and eliminate all the pork, then pass it.

I've actually read the "Sandy relief bill" (HR 1). You can too, if you want to wade through 96 pages of garbage on the House website. It's 96 pages of pork for just about any federal department you can imagine. Included in the feds lining up at the trough are: Secret Service, ATF, Head Start, VA, Dept of Transportation, HUD, DEA, Dept of Defense (all branches are going to get millions), NASA, the "Legal Defense Service" ( I didn't even know we had this bunch of lawyers},Federal Prison System, Corp of Engineers, and Homeland Security. Now, I am sure some of the planned funds to some of these fed agencies might actually get to poor sufferers of the storm in NY and NJ, but does anyone actually think that this is going to be anything but a money grab that byp#$%$ the budget oversight rules that congress loves to ignore anyway? (that bypass of the budget rules is mentioned throughout the bill...just to make sure everyone knows that this cash won't "count" against any budget).

I am going to work on placeing a bill to be voted on to remove almost half of those in Congress by 2016. One representative for every one million people in each state ( rounded up or down by the .5 factor) this is real cost cutting eliminating almost 200 plus of these #$%$ clowns jobs and eliminating their pensions and restructuring those that have not received theirs yet. Good enough for the common man good enough for these do nothing clowns!

Chrisite isn't smart enough to denounce the pork in the bill, then he needs to step down. Or change parties. Dems would love him.

Perhaps if the bill had only contained aid for areas affected by Sandy it would have had a vote in the House. But since the Senate Dems decided to "pork it up" with Billions in unrelated pet projects it was tabled. The people who need the money should be blaming whoever added Alaska fisheries subsidies, new cars for DHA, Community Development grants, and $20+ Billion for future "unspecified" projects.

Hurricane Sandy relief turning into Porkfest 2012...December 19, 2012 by Ed Morrissey
But is the pork in this bill really all that modest?  In my column at TFT, I note that a generous analysis of the bill puts the actual aid for Sandy victims and infrastructural damage at $47 billion out of over $60 billion, meaning almost a quarter of the spending isn’t emergency funding at all.  So what is it?

Various estimates abound for the amount of money being allocated to fund “mitigation” projects intended to prepare the US for future storms.  The numbers range from $10 billion to $28 billion – anywhere from 15 percent to 40 percent of the entire bill.

This might be money well spent in a normal annual budget, depending on what these “mitigation” projects actually propose to do. However, this funding request is for emergency #$%$istance for victims who have waited weeks for help.  If Congress wants to fund these “mitigation” projects, the money should be allocated in the normal budgeting process for Homeland Security.

Some of that money, reports the Heritage Foundation, comes in at $17 billion in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds. Heritage rightly describes this as a “slush fund” for states, spent free from federal accountability. In the past, Heritage reports, “the CDBG program also has funded pork projects such as the Mark Twain House and Museum, the Salvador Dali Museum, and the Helen Keller Birthplace Foundation.”

Again, one can debate the wisdom and administration of the CDBG program, but it’s not a vehicle for disaster relief, and yet it’s nearly 30 percent of the entire bill – and one has to question how much will go to actual Sandy relief.

More of the “mitigation” funds can be found in a $12 billion allocation to the Department of Transportation (which includes the supplemental Amtrak subsidies), ostensibly to repair public-transit systems.  However, more than $5 billion can be reallocated to other DoT priorities, one of which could be to combat “the rise in sea levels,” according to the Heritage analysis.

Those Amtrak subsidies, Heritage further notes, come to $336 million — which is a quarter of their usual annual subsidy, and more than ten times what the White House requested in emergency aid to Amtrak.  Did the storm damage a quarter of Amtrak infrastructure?  Or is this just favored-son pork that piggybacks on the misery of Sandy’s victims?

Normal budgets shouldn’t have a 20%+ pork factor in order to p#$%$, and that’s even more true of emergency relief spending.

Now dubbed the ‘Sandy scam’ by its critics, only a portion of the federal funding goes directly to states and victims hardest hit by superstorm Sandy in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.

Instead $150 million is slated to benefit Alaskan fisheries, $8 million to homeland security and the justice departments for new cars, office equipment, furniture and ‘mobile X-Ray machines,’ and $41 million for eight military bases including Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, the New York Post reports.

A whopping $13 billion will go to preventing future storm damage, including soil erosion and tree planting said to ‘help reduce flood effects, protect water sources, decrease soil erosion and improve wildlife habitat.’

Here are some of the examples of ‘Pork’:

    Preparation against future storms - $13 billion to ‘mitigation’ projects that prepare for future storms
    VA Manhattan Medical Center - $207 million
    Alaskan fisheries through NOAA - $150 million
    Military bases: Eight along the storm’s path, including Guantanamo Bay, Cub - $41 million
    Homeland Security and Justice departments for vehicles and equipment - $8 million
    Kennedy Space Center, Florida - $4 million to repair sand berms and dunes
    Plum Island Animal Disease Center, New York - $3.3 million
    Smithsonian Institution, Washin#$%$on, D.C. - $2 million to repair museum roofs
    National cemeteries - $1.1 million for repairs

Just what I would expect from this clown.  Screaming at Boehner for not wanting to pass a bill full of pork.  Manipulative, just like the President whose #$%$ he likes to kiss.

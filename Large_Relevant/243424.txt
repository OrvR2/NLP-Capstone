McDonald's settles Mich. suit over Islamic dietMcDonald's settles case alleging sandwich sold at Mich. store wasn't halal as advertisedBy Jeff Karoub, Associated Press | Associated Press – Mon, Jan 21, 2013

DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- McDonald's and one of its franchise owners agreed to pay $700,000 to members of the Muslim community to settle allegations a Detroit-area restaurant falsely advertised its food as being prepared according to Islamic dietary law.
                  
McDonald's and Finley's Management Co. agreed Friday to the tentative settlement, with that money to be shared by Dearborn Heights resident Ahmed Ahmed, a Detroit health clinic, the Arab American National Museum in Dearborn and lawyers.
                  
Ahmed's attorney, Kassem Dakhlallah, told The Associated Press on Monday that he's "thrilled" with the preliminary deal that's expected to be finalized March 1. McDonald's and Finley's Management deny any liability but say the settlement is in their best interests.
                  
The lawsuit alleged that Ahmed bought a chicken sandwich in September 2011 at a Dearborn McDonald's but found it wasn't halal — meaning it didn't meet Islamic requirements for preparing food. Islam forbids consumption of pork, and God's name must be invoked before an animal providing meat for consumption is slaughtered.
                  
Dakhlallah said there are only two McDonald's in the United States that sell halal products and both are in Dearborn, which has one of the nation's largest Arab and Muslim communities. Overall, the Detroit area is home to about 150,000 Muslims of many different ethnicities.
                  
The locations advertise that they exclusively sell halal Chicken McNuggets and McChicken sandwiches and they have to get those products from an approved halal provider, Dakhlallah said. He said there was no evidence of problems on the production side, but he alleges that the Dearborn location on Ford Road sold non-halal products when it ran out of halal.
                  
Dakhlallah said he was approached by Ahmed, and they conducted an investigation. A letter sent to McDonald's Corp. and Finley's Management by Dakhlallah's firm said Ahmed had "confirmed from a source familiar with the inventory" that the restaurant had sold non-halal food "on many occasions."
                  
After they received no response to the letter, Dakhlallah said, they filed a lawsuit in Wayne County Circuit Court in November 2011 as part of a class action.
                  
The AP left messages Monday afternoon for attorneys representing the corporation and the franchise.
                  
In the settlement notice, Finley's Management said it "has a carefully designed system for preparing and serving halal such that halal chicken products are labeled, stored, refrigerated, and cooked in halal-only areas." The company added it trains its employees on preparing halal food and "requires strict adherence to the process."
                  
He said although Ahmed believes McDonald's was negligent, there was no evidence that the chain set out to deceive customers.
                  
"McDonald's from the very beginning stepped up and took this case very seriously," Dakhlallah said. "They made it clear they wanted to resolve this. They got ahead of the problem."
                  
The lawsuit covers anyone who bought the halal-advertised products from the Ford Road restaurant and another Dearborn McDonald's with a different owner between September 2005 and last Friday. Since that would be impossible to determine, Dakhlallah said both sides agreed to provide money to community-based charities that benefit members of this group.
                  
The other location on Michigan Avenue wasn't a defendant or a focus of the investigation, Dakhlallah said.
                  
He said the final hearing will ultimately determine who gets what and how much, but roughly $275,000 is expected to go to the Huda Clinic, about $150,000 to the museum, $230,000 to attorneys and $20,000 to Ahmed.
                  
Dakhlallah said he believes it's the first lawsuit of its kind related to McDonald's and halal food.
                  
In 2002, McDonald's agreed to donate $10 million to Hindu and other groups in the U.S. to settle lawsuits that accused the chain of mislabeling french fries and hash browns as vegetarian. The vegetable oil used to prepare the items had contained traces of beef for flavoring purposes.

It cost McDonalds 700,000$ because they tried to provide religious food. I hope they get smart and stop trying.

"it sounds like your the bigot! You are intolerant of what I believe! "

This is one of my favorite stupid people internet tries.  Someone calls you a bigot and so you say "No - you are intolerant of my intolerance therefore you are the bigot".  I had no idea how stupid people were until I started reading these internet posts.

Go back under the rock you Muslims were living under. Go back to the Middle East, Somalia and North Africa. If we have any from Europe go back to Europe or the rock. This is a free country not a country willing to tolerate jihad. How can anybody have a religion that says if you don't believe what i believe i will kill you. None of the Muslims living in this country or any country publicly come out and give a rebuke to the extremists. I wonder what would happen?

You can't cater to everyone.  If someone doesn't like your product the way it is, maybe they should eat somewhere else. I say this as a person that deals with a food allergy. I don't expect everyone to cater to me. If the menu doesn't work for me, I go elsewhere.  Stop the insanity!

"$230,000 to attorneys", so who really won here, sounds like the worthless lawyers.

Maybe McDonalds, and the rest of the American businesses, can use this as a "teachable moment" to learn to stop trying to cater to the food servered in other countries.. This is the United States of America. If you come here from somewhere else, learn to eat what we serve and the way we serve it, just as we have to do when we travel to other countries. You want to be a citizen of this country? Leave what you had where you had it. if you want to keep what you had, why are you here? We are a country unto ourselves, we have our own food, customs, living standards, language, etc. accept them just as we have to in your country or go back to what you had where you had it.

We should neither have to learn other peoples language or food. The only problem is if McDonalds does say it is one way and its not, that is a problem. Just cook American food if they don't like it, they don't have to eat it.

Bloody hostage siege over, explosives teams scour Algerian gas plant for mines, bodiesBy Aomar Ouali And Paul Schemm, The Associated Press | Associated Press – Sun, Jan 20, 2013

ALGIERS, Algeria - Algerian de-mining teams were scouring a gas refinery on Sunday that was the scene of a bloody four-day hostage standoff, searching for explosive traps left by the Islamic militant who took dozens of foreigners prisoner. The siege left at least 23 hostages dead, and the American government warned that there were credible threats of more kidnapping attempts on Westerners.
Algerian special forces stormed the natural gas complex in the Sahara desert on Saturday to end the standoff, and the government said all 32 militants were killed.
With few details emerging from the remote site in eastern Algeria, it was unclear whether anyone was rescued in the final operation, but the number of hostages killed on Saturday — seven — was how many the militants had said that morning they still had. The government described the toll as provisional and some foreigners remained unaccounted for.
British Prime Minister David Cameron said Sunday three Britons were killed and another three are believed dead, as is a British resident.
"Now of course people will ask questions about the Algerian response to these events, but I would just say that the responsibility for these deaths lies squarely with the terrorists who launched a vicious and cowardly attack," Cameron said.
In Ottawa, Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird issued a statement condemning "the deplorable and cowardly attacks by terrorists in Ain Amenas, Algeria."
Baird said it's believed there were no Canadians or dual nationals are among the hostages, and that one permanent resident of Canada who was reported to be onsite has left Algeria and is safe.
There were reports Friday that a news agency in Mauritania — Agence Nouakchott d’Information — has quoted an unnamed source with the militant group who says the hostage-takers included people from Mali, Egypt, Niger, Mauritania and Canada.
Ottawa says it is "pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information" and is in close contact with Algerian authorities.
The siege at Ain Amenas transfixed the world after radical Islamists linked to al-Qaida stormed the complex on Wednesday, which contained hundreds of plant workers from all over the world, then held them hostage surrounded by the Algerian military and its attack helicopters for four tense days that were punctuated with gun battles and dramatic tales of escape.
Algeria's response to the crisis was typical of its history in confronting terrorists, favouring military action over negotiation, which caused an international outcry from countries worried about their citizens. Algerian military forces twice assaulted the two areas where the hostages were being held with minimal apparent mediation — first on Thursday, then on Saturday.
"To avoid a bloody turn of events in response to the extreme danger of the situation, the army's special forces launched an intervention with efficiency and professionalism to neutralize the terrorist groups that were first trying to flee with the hostages and then blow up the gas facilities," Algeria's Interior Ministry said in a statement about the standoff.
De-mining teams began going through the complex late Saturday and Sunday, searching for explosive traps left behind by the militants, the state news service said, citing security officials that it did not name. Sonatrach, the Algerian state oil company running the Ain Amenas site along with BP and Norway's Statoil, said the entire refinery had been mined.
The State Department issued a travel warning Saturday night for Americans in or travelling to Algeria, citing credible threats of the kidnapping of Western nationals. The department also authorized the departure from Algeria of staff members' families if they choose to leave.
Immediately after the assault, French President Francois Hollande gave his backing to Algeria's tough tactics, saying they were "the most adapted response to the crisis."
"There could be no negotiations" with terrorists, the French media quoted him as saying in the central French city of Tulle.
Hollande said the hostages were "shamefully murdered" by their captors, and he linked the event to France's military operation against al-Qaida-backed rebels in neighbouring Mali. "If there was any need to justify our action against terrorism, we would have here, again, an additional argument," he said.
In the final assault, the remaining band of militants killed seven hostages before 11 of them were in turn cut down by the special forces, Algeria's state news agency said. The military launched its Saturday assault to prevent a fire started by the extremists from engulfing the complex and blowing it up, the report added.
A total of 685 Algerian and 107 foreigner workers were freed over the course of the four-day standoff, the Interior Ministry statement said, adding that the group of militants that attacked the remote Saharan natural gas complex consisted of 32 men of various nationalities, including three Algerians and explosives experts.
The military also said it confiscated heavy machine-guns, rocket launchers, missiles and grenades attached to suicide belts.
Algeria has fought its own Islamist rebellion since the 1990s, elements of which later declared allegiance to al-Qaida and then set up new groups in the poorly patrolled wastes of the Sahara along the borders of Niger, Mali, Algeria and Libya, where they flourished.
The standoff has put the spotlight on al-Qaida-linked groups that roam these remote areas, threatening vital infrastructure and energy interests. The militants initially said their operation was intended to stop a French attack on Islamist militants in neighbouring Mali — though they later said it was two months in the planning, long before the French intervention.
The militants, who came from a Mali-based al-Qaida splinter group run by an Algerian, attacked the plant Wednesday morning. Armed with heavy machine-guns and rocket launchers in four-wheel drive vehicles, they fell on a pair of buses taking foreign workers to the airport. The buses' military escort drove off the attackers in a blaze of gunfire that sent bullets zinging over the heads of crouching workers. A Briton and an Algerian — probably a security guard — were killed.
The militants then turned to the vast gas complex, divided between the workers' living quarters and the refinery itself, and seized hostages, the Algerian government said. The gas flowing to the site was cut off.
The accounts of hostages who escaped the standoff showed they faced dangers from both the kidnappers and the military. The militants focused on the foreign workers from the outset, largely leaving alone the hundreds of Algerian workers who were briefly held hostage before being released or escaping.

All things considered, that turned out pretty well. It is obvious that the terroriest wanted to kill, and blow up the complex, and force their demands. I have no doubt that they had lots of people to kill over time for their intended demands, and would have blown up the place anyway because, they are after all terrorists.

No negotiations! Seems like the Algerian mindset was to go in and kill everyone and that would be the sure way to take care of any and all terrorists. Maybe this will serve as a reminder to anyone seeking employment in unstable regions to ask if the job is really worth it. Somehow a big paycheck would not be worth one's life.

The entire point of this operation was to save the plant not the hostages that’s why so many of them died.
They can always hire more workers, the plant is way more valuable than human life.
To the employers.

that is the way to handle these terrorists.  No negations.  I believe the terrorist will think twice (or more) before deciding to use Algeria as a place to negotiate their demands. If the world treated them the same there would be few (if any) such hostage situations.

This country did right, the armed forces did the right thing, kill the terrorists first and answer questions later. None of the BS about talking the way out. The terrorists killed or would have killed the hostages anyway. It's too bad/sad  that the hostages died.

Too bad, they could not identify these cowards, then they could go to their homelands and kill the rest of family members, to make sure there are no more coming from that area.

".....that were first trying to flee with the hostages and then blow up the gas facilities," 

Dont think so...they were surrounded with nowhere to go. This was a poorly constructed rescue attempt.

All the militants killed?  Gee, was that proportional.  While not as neatly done as Israels actions, it seems odd that they can dispose of their militants at the expense of the civilians while if Israel does it, while trying mightily to reduce collateral damage to civilians, it is a despicable thing.  These are BAD people no matter their religion. You deal with them by the rules THEY set.  In Israel, Gaza. the PA or Algeria.

Blog Posts by Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsIn defending Romney video, McCain recalls his own ’08 gaffeBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Sep 18, 2012Tweet0
John McCain defended Mitt Romney's secretly recorded comments about President Barack Obama's supporters being reliant on government handouts—likening it to his own gaffe during the 2008 campaign, when he declared the "fundamentals of the economy are strong."
Per the Tampa Bay Times, McCain, who was campaigning in Florida on Tuesday on behalf of his former GOP rival, said he thinks most Americans ultimately won't care about the Republican presidential nominee's comments on the surreptitiously recorded video at a May fundraiser:

"I can remember in 2008 I said, 'The fundamentals of our economy are strong.' The tidal wave of criticism ... I made several comments which people then said [were] terrible statements. ... When the financial crisis happened we stopped our campaign, we went to Washington. Obama did the same thing. Who got criticized? Who got hammered? John McCain."
McCain continued, "So life isnt fair. It's still a very close race, and I still think that there's a lot of people

Amid campaign turmoil, Romney tries to stay ‘focused’By Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Sep 18, 2012Tweet0
Romney on his plane en route to Utah (Charles Dharapak/AP)SALT LAKE CITY—If this is Mitt Romney's darkest hour in his race for the presidency, he was determined not to show it.
A day after he was forced to defend unscripted remarks caught on camera at a May fundraiser where he suggested President Barack Obama's supporters have a "victim" mentality and are dependent on government handouts, Romney boarded his campaign plane in California on Tuesday morning as though nothing were amiss.
Dressed in a dark blue suit, Romney grinned and laughed with his campaign staff, perhaps knowing that yards away members of his traveling press corps were documenting his every move. Scribes were on the lookout for any clue that might define how the candidate is feeling amid a controversy that some Republicans have openly worried could fatally damage his White House bid.
No detail was too small for reporters analyzing the state of the Romney campaign. What was he reading? What was he chatting about with his staff? Was he watching the leaked videos? At one point, a source near the front of the plane passed on the only concrete information about what Romney was doing as he sat near the front of the plane: He had decided, midway through the 75-minute flight, to have a vegetarian burrito for breakfast.
Asked how the candidate is doing, Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to the campaign, told reporters that Romney remains "focused"—a word he used eight times in five minutes to describe the state of their campaign.
"We are still focused," Madden said. "This is still an election that is focused on the economy. It's focused on the direction of the country. … We remain pretty focused and determined. … He's very focused and determined."

Romney stands by comments in video but says they were ‘not elegantly stated’By Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Mon, Sep 17, 2012Tweet0

COSTA MESA, Calif.—Mitt Romney stood by his comments captured on a hidden camera at a closed-door fundraiser earlier this year in which he called supporters of President Barack Obama "victims" and said they are reliant on government handouts.
In a hastily arranged news conference Monday night, he called his words "off the cuff" and "not elegantly stated," but given several opportunities to back off the comments, he did not.
Romney said he was merely talking about the "political process of drawing people into my own campaign." He described the incident as a "snippet of a question and answer session" and called on the full video to be released to show the question and his response in its full context.
Asked if he was worried that he had offended the 47 percent of people he mentioned in the statement, Romney did not back off his remarks.
"It's not elegantly stated, let me put it that way," Romney said. "I'm speaking off the cuff in response to a question, and I'm sure I can state it more

Romney receives first intelligence briefingBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Mon, Sep 17, 2012Tweet0
LOS ANGELES—Mitt Romney received his first intelligence briefing on Monday, just days after he came under fire for his response to deadly protests against United States diplomatic missions in the Middle East.
The Republican presidential nominee spent roughly two hours behind closed doors at the U.S. Federal Building in West Los Angeles on Monday afternoon. His campaign did not disclose who briefed Romney—saying simply it was someone from the intelligence community, according to spokesman Rick Gorka.

Romney downplays rumors of campaign dramaBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Mon, Sep 17, 2012Tweet0
LOS ANGELES—Mitt Romney downplayed reports of squabbling among his campaign staff, insisting he has a "good team" and that reports suggesting otherwise are simply a distraction.
"I've got a terrific campaign," Romney told Telemundo's Jose Diaz-Balart in an interview set to air Monday. "My senior campaign people work extraordinarily well together. I work well with them. Our campaign is doing well. And frankly—these process stories take away from what's really of concern to the American people."
Romney's comments come a day after Politico published a story citing unnamed sources describing infighting and drama among the candidate's senior advisers who couldn't agree on the campaign's strategy and direction.  Much of the blame was pointed at Stuart Stevens, Romney's senior strategist, but senior Romney aides told Yahoo News Stevens' job was not in danger.

Romney tells Hispanics he’ll fix the economy and immigrationBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Mon, Sep 17, 2012Tweet0
(Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)LOS ANGELES—Mitt Romney made a direct appeal to Hispanic voters on Monday, arguing they haven't benefited from President Barack Obama's economic policies and, if given the chance, he would work with both parties to "permanently fix our immigration system."
In a speech billed by Romney aides as an unofficial reset to his campaign, the Republican presidential nominee reiterated themes he's mentioned before on the campaign trail, arguing that Obama's policies haven't made things better for Americans, especially Hispanics.
"In 2008, candidate Obama promised us a world of limitless hope. What we got instead is a world where hope has painful limits—limits that make it harder to start a business, to grow a business, or to find a job," Romney declared.
While he noted "no one is exempt from the pain of this economy," Romney cited statistics showing the unemployment rate among Hispanics is higher than the national average.
Romney argued that Republicans can turn things around, describing the GOP as a "party of prosperity" and "the party that will restore America's prosperity."
"I am convinced that the Republican Party is the rightful home of Hispanic-Americans," he said.

Amid rumors of discord, Romney seeks to shift strategyBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Mon, Sep 17, 2012Tweet0

LOS ANGELES—Amid rumors of staff infighting and a slide in the polls, Mitt Romney is looking to reset his campaign starting with a speech here Monday before Hispanic voters. He's shaking up his relentless focus on the economy and offering more specifics about a broader range of policies and a clearer argument about why he would be a better president than Barack Obama.
Two senior aides privately dismissed reports of discord over the strategy implemented by Stuart Stevens, the Republican presidential nominee's chief strategist—insisting his job is not in danger and that internal staff grumbling cited in a Politico report published Sunday wasn't as dramatic as described.
But looking to regain control of the message, the campaign offered up Ed Gillespie, a senior Romney adviser, who dismissed the idea that Romney is instituting a major change in strategy, arguing instead that Romney is putting forward "a renewed emphasis" on policies he's previously proposed.
In a conference call with reporters, Gillespie said Romney is simply following the usual trajectory of a presidential campaign by offering more specifics about how he would govern at a time when more Americans are starting to pay closer attention to the campaign.
"It's a natural time in the cycle to do that," Gillespie argued. "We know they know he has a plan. But we also know they want to know more about specifics of that plan."

Romney dishes on daytime TV: He loves Snooki and sleeps in ‘as little as possible’By Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Sep 14, 2012Tweet0

Mitt Romney snores, loves Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and secretly admires Snooki on MTV's "Jersey Shore." Ann Romney hogs the blankets, irritates her husband by leaving the cap off the toothpaste and once walked in on former President George W. Bush getting a massage while exploring the White House.
"He was covered up, but I was so embarrassed that the next time I did see him, I didn't know what I was going to say to him," Ann Romney confessed during a joint interview with her husband on Friday with ABC's "Live! With Kelly and Michael." "We were going down the elevator from the White House going to an event together, and I walked up to the elevator and am just like blushing, blushing, blushing. And he looks at me, and he winks as he does and says, 'I look pretty good, don't I?'"
The taped interview, set to air Tuesday, offered an unusually candid glimpse of the Romneys, as the Republican presidential nominee seeks to lose his reputation of being a stiff and sometimes awkward candidate on the stump. Recent polls have shown that Mitt Romney trails his rival, President Barack Obama, when it comes to "likability"—especially among women voters, who are considered to be a key voting bloc in November.

Romney raises $7.5 million in New YorkBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Sep 14, 2012Tweet0
Romney deplaning in New York on Thursday (Charles Dharapak/AP)NEW YORK--Mitt Romney raised $7.5 million during a fundraising swing in New York over the past 24 hours.

According to his campaign, ticket prices ranged from $2,500 a person to $25,000—the latter granting attendees face time and a photo with the GOP nominee.

Romney adviser on Mideast violence: ‘You’d be in a different situation’ if Mitt were presidentBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Sep 14, 2012Tweet0
(Charles Dharapak/AP)Mitt Romney's campaign is not backing off the candidate's criticism of President Barack Obama's foreign policy approach in the wake of this week's attacks on United States diplomatic missions overseas.
In an interview with the Washington Post's Philip Rucker, Richard Williamson, a top foreign policy adviser to the Republican presidential nominee, suggested the deadly protests that claimed the life of Chris Stevens, the American ambassador to Libya, and three other U.S. diplomatic aides would not have happened if Romney were president.
"There's a pretty compelling story that if you had a President Romney, you'd be in a different situation," Williamson, who served as former President George W. Bush's ambassador to the United Nations, told the Post. "For the first time since Jimmy Carter, we've had an American ambassador assassinated.

favela-capitalism... the history of brazil and its slaves is the reason why many of the poor people are black. Can't afford education, health and proper housing so what do they do? Build a favela next to the cities where they can get access to some utilities, services and be able to survive. Capitalism... 
Your numbers of blacks in the favela is wrong btw. The majority is mixed.

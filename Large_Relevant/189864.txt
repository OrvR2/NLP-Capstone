the problem isn't the guns.
the problem is the parents that can't take care of their children and take the time to teach them about gun safty,but really why would a sells man sell someone three guns?
why﻿ just only allow to buy one?
99% its the parents fault...
1%gun sells man fault
i don't think its going to work banning guns, because there's other states that do allow guns and then theirs states that don't,.one could just simply buy a gun from the state that can and take it anywhere...

For Hadiya's family,
So very sad. You memories & struggles to recover from your tragic loss will be a beacon of your love & her purpose in her brief life. Another senseless loss of a precious child, an integral part of a family wherein she was surely loved & cherished. Now remembered & missed by so many, far too many others, who are also the victims of violent crimes & so much loss. The proliferation of gun﻿ ownership by those who should have absolutely no access to such weapons has to stop!

You need to remove guns from the entire country for a ban to actually work.
A﻿ "ban" doesn't mean much when someone can just drive an hour to a neighboring city and buy guns there and drive them back to Chicago.

We're already in a huge debate whether guns should be more﻿ strictly regulated and these kinds of assholes are just proving that guns are a terrible thing to have. Wtf. Good job. Fucking idiot gangs that are just a bunch of ignorant fucks with nothing better to do, but put the country that they live in, in a terrible state. That should be priority number one. Government should just come in and kill every fucking gang member. I don't who and how old they are. Shoot the motherfucker.

 hmm. the polices officers in this video are black and they talk about gang violence...
another reason to be raciest...
some blacks just can't be civilized and can't fit in with other ethic groups,so they make ghetto gangs. example : bloods and﻿ crips
and i wonder why foreigners call Americans stupid...

At no time have colored peoples of your world degenerated so malignantly as has been the case, since ancient times, with the white races, and will still be for a long time, who regard themselves as the ruling races of the Earth.

You mean when he wasn't raping children? It's funny how everyone forgets about his pedophilia after he's dead. All hail the creepy child molester, right? And despite the fact that its' well known he paid to have his skin bleached and the disease he claimed﻿ to have doesn't resemble how he looked... at all doesn't raise any red flags for you? Single man, never married, runs a pedophile theme park in his back yard, and sleeps in bed with other peoples children... true american hero, right?

Tell﻿ me something, you're accused of molesting several children you didn't molest and you're facing 2 choices... use your endless money to prove in court before the world that you didn't do it- clearing your name OR pay the families in back room deals and get them to sign non-disclosure agreements...essentially hush money. The innocent person pays off the victim? Of course not, they defend themselves and their honor.
Only the guilty pay off the victims.

You only know about some of 'the kids'. Between 1980 and 1998 there was 12 children who were all paid off with a non-disclosure agreement, they didn't admit they lied because they legally were never allowed to publicly address it again, the kids that admitted they lied hadn't got their money yet... so﻿ maybe he didn't rape those little liars, but all evidence is he raped the other dozen.

Just cause it was easier for him to pay them off, how is that evidence? The accusation of child molestation could never be proven against him in court. In spite of his success,﻿ and his acquired fortune, he has had a difficult life.

So you're telling me if you're accused of raping a dozen children you wouldn't want to prove in a court, in front of the world you﻿ were innocent, you would choose to pay them off and hush them up?
That's what guilty people do. he whole world felt this way until he died, then he became a hero again. The most popular pedophile ever.

MJ can'y control how the media portrays him.
None of the assertions corresponded to the truth, rather, on the contrary, everything﻿ was only mendacious inventions in order to draw a financial gain out of it. They all took the money.
Unfortunately, his funeral was be made into a monstrous spectacle, which corresponds to a glorification.

No, it﻿ certainly has nothing to do with money. The wealthy could never get away with a crime they committed (like OJ). They're always prosecuted to the full extent of the law (like Lindsay Lohan). Having money and fame never keeps you out of trouble (like Snoop Dog).

Lol. So it's not racist if you add a nationality in front of the race? Yeah... it doesn't work that way. You're first going to have to show that Chicago has more black people per capita before you can even begin to draw parallels between violence and race... which of course you can't considering the black to white ratio of chicago is pretty much the same as other major cities that have less violence.
Facts, you should check them out﻿ before talking.

Judging an entire demographic based on the music they listen to... and this seems reasonable? You're﻿ going to completely dismiss economic disparity, bad neighborhoods, absentee fathers, social stigma, drugs in suburbs, the failing education system, unemployment, failure for most to earn a living wage even with a full time job, and political oppression- instead, you're going to base it on their iPod playlist. Sounds reasonable to me.

I wouldn't deny that loud music isn't annoying, I just don't see how one can draw a direct connection between loud music and gun violence. I would think it's far less likely that the music breeds gangs as it is that gangs are drawn to the music, but not just gangs... tween girls and wannabe white boys like rap too and﻿ generally aren't involved in much gang activity.

I absolutely agree. And I wouldn't even limit it to music. I would extend your claim to all sound in general. For example, whenever I hear﻿ construction noise, I begin pounding my face on my desk like a jackhammer. And when I hear birdsong, I shimmy up a phone pole, perch myself out on the telephone line and shit on anything that happens to be below me.

So what about Latino and Mexican gangs which are very prevalent and more violent than black gangs? What about bike gangs? Most bike gangs are white. Chinese gangs. Every race has a gang and that includes white people. I have been watching this debate and you have an excuse for every word you say no matter how irrelevant or ignorant you sound. Your argument is moot. What do you think﻿ about people who are white are white and black? I am very curious.

Once﻿ again another sad senseless death. As a gun owner, I'm sure many people will blame me for her death. As an NRA member, they'll say that makes me doubly responsible. If that were the case, I could save Rahm Emanuel time, and the people of Chicago a ton of money paying 200 police officers, as I'd just turn myself in. But neither I nor any of the millions of legal gun owners caused this sweet girl's tragic death. Banning guns won't stop criminals. Because you can't ban evil.

Don't you people see what the media and government is doing? Are you that dumb? They are pushing for﻿ anti-gun laws hard and they are using children to do it. They know that children are a soft spot for the masses and they are utilizing that. Children dying by gunfire isn't something new, tragic, but not new. If you think anti-gun laws are being pushed to protect children you are extremely naive and I'm sure you also believe that the U.S. goes to war for freedom and not corporate interest.

notice how this always tends to happen in areas with heavy gun control
and how almost﻿ all of the recent shootings have happened in no gun zones.
in the past few year murders have actually gone down tremendously un until recently. also in the last few year people in america have been buying enough guns to arm nations like china and india
hmm
perhaps its the restrictions causing more harm than good

Well, I loaded my gun today and sat it down on the floor. I ordered it to go do many﻿ number of things including rob a bank, shoot up a school, and shoot up a movie theater.
It just sat there on the floor.
Either I have one lazy ass gun or guns just don't do those things.
I tried ordering to do some other﻿﻿ things such as open a can of tuna, feed the dogs and make my bed.
It seems that my gun can't do much at all.
I wonder if this is common to all guns?

Next on the stand of the trial is a Glock 28...
Since it can't speak,﻿ move or do anything else unless acted upon, the gun is found 'Not Guilty'.
The guy who held the pistol, along with pointing it at a person & pulling the trigger is next up...
'Guilty of Murder', a crime that in most counties will get em hung.
In the US, it's 25 years for murder with a non-violet pot smoker doing life for a 1/2 pound.
No wounder things have turned to shit in once great communities in the US.

I can't tell what is more shameful: the media exploiting story to feed current trends, politicians using the story as propaganda for their agendas or american public that are watching the story and are expecting an instant self-gratification solution.
Guns are the tools of violence not the cause of it. Instead they should investigate﻿ the cause but would require real commit to the public safety. Instead they label guns as the boogie-man to all social ills and unrest.

Every tool can be effective, if you want they could have gone and pump some gas from a gas station and walked up to the group and splashed them all then toss a flare. Sick people will always find a way to make anything effective they will go to the lengths to accomplish that.
Now imagine the same people brought up right and educated right,﻿ what great length would those same people do to advance mankind morally, scientifically or spiritually?

So it is not gun violence but the total disregard for life by youth and young adults that killed the girl. If we want to dig deeper, the turf war can be drug related too. So what the fuck. The gun killed the Hadiya is only the problem that bubbled to the surface of much deeper real﻿ problems.
Open your goddamn eyes and don't let the tv/internet babysit your children. Turning away from the problems your children face is what turns them into killers.

notice how all these shootings tend to happen in areas with heavy gun restriction.
the gun laws are not the same all across america.
they differ per state.
Illinois has some of the worst gun crimes. and also has some of the most﻿ restrictions on guns
you can't buy a gun at every store and you can't buy ammo at every gas station
these criminals tend to use stolen guns, and in areas where guns are restricted heavy violent crime tends to go up.
just saying the guns is only an item

Have you ever visited England? Because I have. The Manchester\Wigan area to﻿ be precise. And guess what, all the street thugs were armed with cutting weapons. It was so bad that regular Citizens were carrying blades to protect themselves from them! Australia was the EXACT same way. After they banned guns they became the stabbing capitol of the world!

I didn't visit England. I studied and worked there for many years.
I can tell you I have a better chance of surviving thugs with knifes than a high powered assault rifle.
You cry for help when against people people knifes, some people of the public can actually help you.
And people have a chance outrunning thugs with knives. you cannot outrun bullets.

violent crime itself goes up. in other words beatings, stabbings,robberies that sorta thing.
Australia and the UK are perfect examples.
so a few less shootings and now you have to worry about getting beaten,robbed,rapped by a pack of wild gang members.
when everyone has an equal means of defense. a 6 foot tall man and a 4 foot tall woman are﻿ equal carrying the same gun. thats the theory.
the countries that banned guns fall prey to anyone willing to do the citizens harm

Your argument have 0 connection with reality. If someone walks up to you and pulls out a gun - what kind of fucking difference does it makes if you have a gun in your pocket or not? Hes already pointing his gun at you!
Would you prefer to be beaten, in worst case stabbed, than being shot at? Or would you prefer a maniac with a gun or a maniac with a﻿ knife? I thought so.
Oh we do see how guns prevent crimes on Americas example, last month showed that perfectly clear

a maniac with a gun? you get a few psychos like the sandy hook guy. most gun offenses are done by gang members like the ones that killed this girl.
those guys will usually back off if they know you have a gun. there's been many accounts of such events where crimes were stopped due to law abideing people showing they had them. no shots even had to be fired. i'm one of those people too.
all those gun crime last month happened in no gun zones btw.﻿ aside from the mall.

A few psychos? So its okay when ANYONE can walk into a classroom full of children and massacres them - you say its okay, there's just few of them.
Be as it may, gangs or not, if a criminal point a gun at you, you have no chance of using your﻿ gun. Ofcourse if a criminal is a retard and does that in open public - sure strangers with gun might help, but they're not so stupid too.
Adam Lanza had a AR - thats low gun zone for you. More guns - more people like him emerge

His mother. The weapon is banned (Connecticut has an assault﻿ weapon ban). It was a grandfathered-in weapon. Even if the USA were to ban weapons universally, they wouldn't be allowed to confiscate under the 2nd amendment. In addition, less guns statistically means more violence.Notice I didn't say gun violence. You can compare the USA to the UK and the UK has more violent crime. Also statistically you can see that in the past 20 years (FBI stats), violent crime in the USA has decreased 50%.

Do you honestly think that guns are the reason crime rate has decreased in last 20 years?﻿ Not the education, not higher stantards of living, not healthcare, not wealthier population... its guns that reduced cime rate...
As far as I know UK is experiencing pretty fuck it times because of idiot politicians, but thats just my opinion. Why not we compare USA with Germany gun violence and crimes? Lets do that? Oh wait no, that entirely destroys your position so lets not

this is the united states we're talking about, not china or india. the education rates, standard of living, healthcare, wealth generation has been steady over the past 20 years more or less. the last 5 years are the worst the economy has performed in generations.
I am not arguing for or against guns but if﻿ you're going to attribute the decrease in violent crime in the US over the past 20 years to better education and standard of living, then you're way off the mark.

Ruslan. I said violence, NOT gun violence for a reason. Not what people used to commit violent crime, but the fact they are committing it regardless of any bans in place. We don't have improved education, standards of living, healthcare, or wealth. In fact, if anything, the rich﻿ are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer and the middle class is getting pushed into poverty.
As far as Germany goes, I don't have any raw data, whereas USA has FBI stats and the UK has the Home Office.

And how did Lanza had ammo for his banned grandfathered-in AR? And who cares if its﻿ grandfathered-in? Its a banned extremely lethal weapon not made to be used by civilians.
Thats another problem with America, just my opinion. Clinging to the document written in what, 18th century? 2nd amendment was written in different times where they didn't have AR, only muskets. Why don't we arm civilians with bazookas and grenades? Those are also arms that technically fall under 2nd amendment

It's called protection against a tyrannical government. That's﻿ why private ownership is a part of the 2nd amendment. Muskets were used by the military. Musket vs musket was an even match. So when we talk modern day, if we had to defend or, worst-case scenario, attack our government, we are on an equal playing field with like-weapons.

In 21th century armed population is not a threat for the government, but they are a threat for unsuspecting citizens. This is another myth used by gun supporters that has no ground under it, if a government uses tanks, heavy artilery, fighter jets or simply organized and trained infantry - armed population is nothing, I mean literally nothing compared﻿ to gevernment forces.
Military uses rocket launchers and grenades, vehicles, tanks, what equal plain field are you talking about

Adam lanza walked into a no gun zone.﻿ that state also had banned that type of semi auto.
didn't stop him from getting it.
you really do not know how guns and criminals work. you never had to deal with gang members. and yes i have had one pointed at me. i didn't even have to pull mine. all i had to do was make it known and they backed off.

A criminal feels more confident when he or she has an advantage by having a gun, if a﻿ potential victim would have a gun then it would deter the criminal in the first place, or give the potential victim a fighting chance

that's how criminals usually behave. him firing his gun in downtown Indy would have attracted unwanted attention.
there have been many accounts of the same thing happening to others.
guns used in such a manner save more lives﻿ than take.
that's why these places with heavy gun restrictions have the highest crime rates. not just gun crime but crime period.
all i did was put my hand on mine and mr criminal said have a nice day and walked away.
you wont understand this until you live it

So if a criminal points a gun at you, just point out that you have a gun too and show it to him, then he'll crap his pants and run away... thats briliant
That's not how﻿ criminals behave, you're very lucky to be alive right now, its very likely that criminal will shoot out of fear or threat.

Banning guns is the reason﻿ crime rates (murder,assault,rape,home invasion,robberies..ect) soared in the UK and Australia. Also it﻿ makes citizens unable﻿ to defend themselves and they will rely on the police wheres police brutality and misconduct have been rising with the instability of our country

Look man. I have lived an hours drive from Chicago in the state next door all my life. This has absolutely nothing to do about gun control or lack of gun control. Before they had gun control in Chicago, it was nothing to find murdered bodies in the cornfields in my state that the mob had murdered in Chicago, Illinois.﻿ You live in Italy so you should know something about mob activity in Chicago. You will forgive me for being stereotypical while you are being ignorant.

Question: "Why are Jewish and Black leaders anti-gun"?
Answer: Jewish Leaders are anti-gun because Zionists are Jewish Genocidal Racial Supremacists who want to enslave the Gentile World.
Black Leaders are anti-gun because our Zionist controlled political system only allows Black People to become leaders if﻿ they are 100% Uncle Toms.
The 2 videos below explain why we will NOT give up our guns to Uncle Tom Obama.

If your reading comprehension was improved you would see that I did not paint Black and Jewish people with the same brush. I said that our Zionist dominated political and media system means that black people can only become leaders﻿ if they comply with the requirements of Zionists. White leaders also must pass through the same restrictive filter, that's why the Obama presidency has not changed anything about the way Washington is subservient to Wall Street, the FED and AIPAC.

are the gun laws working in chicago? is the infamy that the media grants to perpetrators of gun violence leading to a rash of copycat shootings? are the true underlying issues causing violent crime within american society getting the attention they deserve? are we getting the full story from the "media"? are the interests of the common man﻿ a concern to those in power? etc... etc.... and so on...

Because Chicago exists solely as an Island and its border isn't easy to cross at all, right? It's the same as banning guns in schools. It doesn't work, because﻿ the affected area is too small. "Moron".

Chicago﻿ does not have a total gun ban, where are all of you getting this from? Just because you have to drive 10 miles to buy your firearm legally doesn't mean guns are banned. That is unconstitutional or did you miss DC v. Heller?

And that has nothing to do with the color of the skin, with race, with genetics. It's got everything to do﻿ with the culture of people being part of an impoverished demographic with lack of opportunity and perspective and with absence of social mobility. People of that group behave similarly, regardless of color.

What the fuck is your point? Your fucking unrelated facts regarding skin-color is totally misleading. To a stupid racist prick like you it's not just "violence" if it﻿ ain't white. Don't get me started on whites killing entire races of indigenous peoples, starting wars, inhumane treatment of blacks and violence etc etc...

There are so many issues in America other than just gun issues that need to be addressed. The "War on Drugs" is one of the big contributes to the high number of gun deaths in America. America does need to address the gun issue but it also needs to stop treating drug use as a criminal issue and start viewing it as a﻿ health issue.

Agreed, Baltimore has had some success by targeting guns instead of drugs, however, drugs prohibition is the source of the violence. That is the﻿ real issue at stake.

5daysagoEgyptian president imposes state of emergency in 3 cities after deadly clashesA day after 37 people were killed in protests, chaos erupted among the thousands who walked to mourn them. Meanwhile, President Morsi declared a state of emergency. NBC's Ayman Moyeldin reports. Follow @NBCNewsWorld

By Edmund Blair and Yasmine Saleh, ReutersCAIRO - Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi declared a month-long state  of emergency on Sunday in three cities along the Suez Canal which have been the  focus of anti-government violence that has killed dozens of people over the past  four days.
 Seven people were shot dead and hundreds were injured in Port  Said on Sunday during the funerals of 33 protesters killed at the weekend. A  total of 49 people have been killed in demonstrations around the country since  Thursday and Morsi's opponents have called for more protests on Monday. 
"Down, down Morsi, down down the regime that killed and tortured us!" people  in Port Said chanted as the coffins of those killed on Saturday were carried  through the streets.

 In a televised address, Morsi said a nightly curfew  would be introduced in Port Said, Ismailia and Suez, starting Monday evening. He  also called for dialogue with top politicians. About 200 people protested in  Ismailia after the announcement."The protection of the nation is the  responsibility of everyone. We will confront any threat to its security with  force and firmness within the remit of the law," the president said, adding that  he offered condolences to families of the victims of those who died in the  cities.In Cairo the newly appointed interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim  was ejected from the funeral of one of the police officers who died during  Saturday's clashes in Port Said, according to witnesses and police sources.

A police officer at the funeral said many of his colleagues blame the interior  minister on the deaths of at least two policemen during Saturday's clashes as he  did not allow the police there to carry weapons and were only given teargas  bombs.
 State television said seven people died from gunshot wounds on  Sunday. Port Said's head of hospitals, Abdel Rahman Farag, told Reuters more  than 400 people had suffered from teargas inhalation, while 38 were wounded by  gunshots.Gunshots had killed many of the 33 who died on Saturday when  residents went on the rampage after a court sentenced 21 people, mostly from the  Mediterranean port, to death for their role in deadly soccer violence at a  stadium there last year.A military source said many people in Port  Said, which lies next to the increasingly lawless Sinai Peninsula, possess guns  because they do not trust the authorities to protect them. However it was not  clear who was behind the deaths and injuries.In Cairo, police fired  teargas at dozens at protesters throwing stones and petrol bombs in a fourth day  of clashes over what demonstrators there and in other cities say is a power grab  by Islamists two years after Hosni Mubarak was overthrown.In Ismaila  city, which lies on the Suez Canal between the cities of Suez and Port Said,  police also fired teargas at protesters attacking a police station with petrol  bombs and stones, according to witnesses and a security source there.The protesters accuse Morsi, elected in June with the support of his  Muslim Brotherhood group, of betraying the democratic goals of the revolution.  Most of the deaths since Thursday were in Port Said and Suez, both cities where  the army has now been deployed.The violence adds to the daunting task  facing Morsi as he tries to fix a beleaguered economy and cool tempers before a  parliamentary election expected in the next few months which is supposed to  cement Egypt's transition to democracy.Deep riftIt has exposed a deep rift in  the nation. Liberals and other opponents accuse Morsi of failing to deliver on  economic promises and say he has not lived up to pledges to represent all  Egyptians. His backers say the opposition is seeking to topple Egypt's first  freely elected leader by undemocratic means.Heba Morayef of Human  Rights Watch in Cairo said a state of emergency reintroduced laws that gave  police sweeping powers of arrest "purely because (people) look suspicious"."It is a classic knee jerk reaction to think the emergency law will help  bring security," she said. "It gives so much discretion to the Ministry of  Interior that it ends up causing more abuse which in turn causes more anger."

The opposition Popular Current and other groups have called for more  protests on Monday to mark what was one of the bloodiest days of the 2011  uprising.On a bridge close to Tahrir  Square, youths hurled stones at police in riot gear who fired teargas to push  them back towards the square, the cauldron of the uprising that erupted on  January 25, 2011 and toppled Mubarak 18 days later. "None of the  revolution's goals have been realized," said Mohamed Sami, a protester in  Cairo's Tahrir Square on Sunday."Prices are going up. The blood of  Egyptians is being spilt in the streets because of neglect and corruption and  because the Muslim Brotherhood is ruling Egypt for their own interests."Clashes also erupted in other streets near the square. The U.S. and  British embassies, both close to Tahrir, said they were closed for public  business on Sunday, normally a working day.The army, Egypt's interim  ruler until Morsi's election, was sent back onto the streets to restore order in  Port Said and Suez, which both lie on the Suez canal. In Suez, at least eight  people were killed in clashes with police.Many ordinary Egyptians are  frustrated by the violence that have hurt the economy and their livelihoods."They are not revolutionaries protesting," said taxi driver Kamal  Hassan, 30, referring to those gathered in Tahrir. "They are thugs destroying  the country."Call for dialogueThe National Defence Council,  headed by Morsi, called on Saturday for national dialogue to discuss political  differences.That offer has been cautiously welcomed by the opposition  National Salvation Front. But the coalition has demanded a clear agenda and  guarantees that any agreements will be implemented.The Front, formed  late last year when Morsi provoked protests and violence by expanding his powers  and driving through an Islamist-tinged constitution, has threatened to boycott  the parliamentary poll and call for more protests if its demands are not met,  including for an early presidential vote.Egypt's transition has been  blighted from the outset by political rows and turbulence on the streets that  have driven investors out and kept many tourists away. Its currency, the pound,  has steadily weakened against the dollar.

Pure Hatred there.1 vote#82.3 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:41 PM ESTDaveyJonesDetroitYep, just remember what the religion of Marx accomplished in the 20th century.  20-25 MILLION Russians killed by Stalin, 60-85 MILLION Chinese killed by MAO.  [Remember when the White House communications director called MAO her "favorite political philosopher..."?]  Che Guevara was a mere pipsqueak as an atheist Marxist murderer, only having only killed 102,000 of his own people and exiling another HALF MILLION to re-education camps where they either DIED or became POLITICALLY CORRECT.
Lorenz, ever question why you have a "reflexive loathing" for all things traditional, Christian, and American?  Do you ever think about why you HATE your fellow Americans more than the people trying to KILL YOU AND ME merely because we are Americans? 
I’m wondering if you’ve heard of a book by an ex-CIA counter-intel and counter-terrorism expert on the origins of Political Correctness, a form of censorship with a specific Marxist origin. Kent Clizbe, in his book "Willing Accomplices" [Ashburn, VA: ANDEMCA Press, 2011--Available on Kindle from Amazon_com and from KentClizbe_com in paperback] supports his assertion that PC was a ready-made "payload" of ideology to demoralize and divide America. This was infused into Academia, Hollywood and the press since the 1920s by influence agents under the direct control of Lenin's KGB. Hollywood's Otto Katz, George S. Counts of Columbia University Teacher's College and the New York Times were specific vehicles (either "dupes" or "willing accomplices") for Willi Muenzenberg's creed (as recounted by his wife Babbette Gross--any relation to Teri Gross of NPR?) which advanced the main goals of COMINTERN, Communism International, while specifically avoiding self-identification with Stalin or the USSR. Clizbe's book makes for some interesting reading, if you're curious about where PC came from--highly referenced and persuasive, if you're "open minded" enough, and if you dare...

It had caused so much problems in the Arab world, and attention as well as resources are wasted to resolve the differences between two main Muslim sects (SORRY vs. @!$%#TY).
Israel should help Assad to stay in power a few more years by selling ammunition and/or repair Assad aircraft/tanks. Syria rebels will collapse because of diseases and starvation, but Syria is just another Gaza Strip on Israel border where Israel soldiers can patrol with Assad blessing.1 vote#83 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 8:38 PM EST

"Oh this is just temporary" until the constitution and the Congress was elected. Then push the constitution thru without any debate that included other minority groups. Seems like a blatant power grab to me with Muslim Brotherhood pulling the strings. Hence, why getting everything pushed through before the actual revolutionaries caught on to what they were doing...FAIL!
 This will be "Arab Spring ll", only hopefully the ouster  of the old Muslim culture and the moderates gain control.

Yep, we gotta stop being stupid.  Kind of a tall order if there's nothing of value offered to replace the wisdom of the Founders, whose efforts were the distillation of the Enlightenment, all of history to that point, and for most, a devout Dissenting Protestant Christian faith.

The continuation of this aid is unlikely to have better results, however in some fashion it may prevent a larger armed conflict, at the expense of driving an arm's race in the region.  Essentially, Egypt is dictating the price to, and the cost of the U.S. for the outward appearance of peace in the region.
"President Mubarak and military leaders view our military assistance program as the cornerstone of our mil-mil relationship and consider the USD 1.3 billion in annual FMF as "untouchable compensation" for making and maintaining peace with Israel. The tangible benefits to our mil-mil relationship are clear: Egypt remains at peace with Israel, and the U.S. military enjoys priority access to the Suez Canal and Egyptian airspace. We believe, however, that our relationship can accomplish much more. Over the last year, we have engaged MOD leaders on developing shared strategic objectives to address current and emerging threats, including border security, counter terrorism, civil defense, and peacekeeping. Our efforts thus far have met with limited success." - Margaret Scobey

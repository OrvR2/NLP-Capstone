Close to half of kids late receiving vaccines: studyBy Genevra Pittman | Reuters – Mon, Jan 21, 2013

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - More and more babies and toddlers aren't getting their recommended vaccines on time, a new study suggests.
              Of more than 300,000 U.S. kids born between 2004 and 2008, almost half were "undervaccinated" at some point before their second birthday - in some cases because parents chose to forgo shots recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
              Researchers said that trend is cause for concern because if enough kids skip their vaccines, whole schools or communities may be at higher risk for preventable infections such as whooping cough and measles.
              "When that happens, it can create this critical mass of susceptible individuals," said Saad Omer, from the Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta.
              "For some vaccinated kids, their risk of getting the disease also goes up," Omer, who wasn't involved in the new study, told Reuters Health.
              That's because no vaccine protects recipients perfectly from infection. So public health officials rely, in addition, on so-called "herd immunity" to keep vaccine-preventable diseases from spreading.
              For their report, Jason Glanz from Kaiser Permanente Colorado in Denver and his colleagues analyzed data from eight managed care organizations, including immunization records for about 323,000 kids.
              During the study period, the number of kids who were late on at least one vaccine - including their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) and diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) shots - rose from 42 percent to more than 54 percent. Babies born toward the end of the study were late on their vaccines for more days, on average, than those born earlier.
              Just over one in eight kids went undervaccinated due to parents' choices. For the rest, it wasn't clear why they were late with their shots. Some could have bounced in and out of insurance coverage, Glanz suggested, or were sick during their well-child visits, so doctors postponed vaccines.
              Undervaccinated kids also tended to have fewer doctors' appointments and emergency room visits than those who got their shots on time, according to findings published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.
              That could be because their parents more often turn to alternative or complementary medicine when it's an option, Omer said.
              Recent studies have shown many parents are asking to delay or skip certain vaccines, often citing safety concerns such as a link between vaccines and autism - a theory which scientists now agree holds no water (see Reuters Health story of Nov 28, 2011 here: http://reut.rs/tvpjVf).
              "We don't really know if these 'alternative schedules' as they're called are as safe, less safe or more safe than the current schedule," Glanz told Reuters Health.
              "What we're worried about is if (undervaccination) becomes more and more common, is it possible this places children at an increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases? It's possible that some of these diseases that we worked so hard to eliminate come back," he said.
              Glanz said any parents who are considering an alternative vaccination schedule should talk with their child's doctor first - and be especially careful about what they read online.
              "We don't have any evidence that there are any safety concerns with the current recommended schedule, and right now the best way to protect your child from infection is to get your child vaccinated on time," he said.

A recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) reveals that an astounding 97% of children affected by a mumps outbreak that swept the Northeast back in 2009 had already been vaccinated for the condition in accordance with recommended government guidelines.

Give a date this so-called appeared the NEJM, just did a search and nothing shows up like that, think mark is just making things as he goes along, facts do prove that there are less then ten percent of the cases of mumps then there were before the vaccine, and there are far few deaths among the young and the old from mumps now

Parents are excercising common sense when it comes to administering vaccines and that's news yet noone in the media questions how heavility loaded the CDC immunization schedule is or the fact that some kids get up to seven shots in one visit. We're talking babies here. Noone wants to see diseases spread but we still don't have a handle on the long term effect of all these shots on a young child's immune system. Kids today get 24 shots by age two. That is too many, too soon. It's time to put on the brakes on what has become  a runaway train and that is what parents are doing - taking a stand on behalf of their kids. Meanwhile the CDC just keeps pushing this.

I have heard mixed reviews.  Some [medical] sources say the flu strain that is going around was part of this year's vaccination, some say it was not.  Issue is still that people do not know who to trust.  The media hides behing freedom of press, but they do not report news, just a bunch of op-ed pieces.  You have low-IQ celebrities that are somehow experts on vaccines ausing autism.  But you cannot sue them for people reporting this trash because they are protected by the first ammendment.  I don't want to repeal any constitutional ammentment.  Not the first, and definitely not the second, but it should be more difficult to call yourself "press" if all you do is spread propaganda that endangers people, children in particular. IMHO!

There's a HUGE gap between "recommended" and "mandatory".

Everyone who loves Dr. Oz should know that he gets paid by Big Pharma for promoting vaccinations, but he refuses to get his own children vaccinated.  Coincidence?  I think not.  He knows there are real poisons in the vaccines.  Don't believe me?  His interview stating such is on YouTube.  Go look for yourself.

Fewer doctor and ER visits? And this is not seen as a good thing? Hmmm...

I only got seven shots when I was a child.  seven.   and those were spread out over years. One at a time and no clustering of shots. There were no pandemics because of it. Why do we need to give young babies with immature immune systems 24 shots by age 2. it's ludicrous

I hate taking vaccines. I'm due for a tetanus and the end of the year and dreading it but I will still go take it. I understand both sides of the argument. Some vaccines given are unnecessary and in my opinion the flu shot is an example of that. But some vaccines are necessary and you may be hurting your children by not having them vaccinated.

If you have kids, you need to KNOW what the hell is in those vaccines. The problem is when you ask...most everybody gets the run around. If you were to find out you may not want it floating in your childs viens or in his or her brain either. Thats why homeopathic medicine (the medicine of our forefathers) which is also the state medicine of countrys like Germany, are getting very popular with alot of folks. It works and is much much safer.

Recommended vaccines not required vaccines. For those of you who are told your kids can't attend school without them please know that you can do an online search for "vaccine exemption" (insert state name). For example, Texas allows exemptions for philosophical reasons but you have to look up the address to request the forms. Then sign them before a notary. Request several because some schools claim to lose them... In other states no forms are required you can simply tell them no. Most school districts and news reporters lie to you.

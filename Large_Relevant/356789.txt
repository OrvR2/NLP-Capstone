After it's closure, Mullen spent many years booking shows for Club Lingerie.  It was during this time he met Anthony Kiedis and Flea and after hearing their demo, Mullen offered them an opening slot on a Bad Brains show. The Red Hot Chili Peppers credit him as one of their first major supports and giving them their start. Through his support and the many nightclubs he worked out the scene gave birth to not only the Red Hot Chili Peppers but bands like The Go-Go's, X, The Weirdos and The Germs.Links:Website: http://redhotchilipeppers.com/Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/ChiliPeppersTwitter: http://twitter.com/chilipeppers"Brendan's Death Song" Lyrics:If I die before I get it done will you decide? Take my words and turn them into signs they will survive, Because a long time ago I knew not to deprive. It's safe out there now your every where just like the sky, And you are love, you are the lucid dream you are the ride And when you hear this you know it's your jam it's your good bye Like I said you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone And when the drummer drums he's gonna play my song to carry me along Like I said you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone And when the boatman comes to ferry me away to where we all belong We all cross when when were feeling lost it's just the time. Kateri cried the day her lover died, she recognized, Because you gave her a life of real love it's no surprise. The nights are long but the years are short when you're alive, Way back when will never be again it was a time. It's gonna catch you so glad I met you to walk the line. Like I said you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone And when the drummer drums he's gonna play my song to carry me along Like I said you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone And when the boatman comes to ferry me away to where we all belong Like I said you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone, And when the drummer drums he's gonna play my song to carry me along. Like I said you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone, And when the boatman comes to ferry me away to where we all belong. Let me live, so when it's time to die, even the Reaper cries. Let me die so when it's time to live another sun will rise. Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah Like I said you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone And when the drummer drums he's gonna play my song to carry me along Like I said you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone And when the boatman comes to ferry me away to where we all belong Like I said you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone Like I said you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone Like I said you know I'm almost dead, you know I'm almost gone

Disappeared. No trace. Musky tears. Suitcase. The down turn brave little burncub bearcareless turnip snare rampages pitch color pages...down and out but not in Vegas. Disembarks and disengages. No loft. Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dewskin fortitude for the sniffing black noses that snort and allude to the dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink its. It's for you. Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck muscles and bottlenosed grifters arrive in time to catch the late show. It's a beehive barrel race. A shehive stare and chase wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her. Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost. The kind that you find when you mind your own business. Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters into the newmorning milk blanket. Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay. get your broom and sweep echoes of yesternights fallen freckles...AWAY!!!

Knock Me Down by Red Hot Chili Peppers




by RHCPfan34


            382,296 views
          


        "Knock Me Down" is a single from the Red Hot Chili Peppers album Mother's Milk.The song depicts a negativity towards the stereotypically egotistic lifestyle of your typical rockstar. The band's opposition is displayed through their lyrics: "If you see me getting mighty / If you see me getting high / Knock me down / I'm not bigger than life."The lyrics are written in reference to the popular saying, "high and mighty."Anthony Kiedis and John Frusciante sing all the lyrics simultaneously, but the record label edit of the song is mixed in such a way that Frusciante's vocals are set louder than Kiedis' throughout the song. The original, longer version of this song is featured on the bonus Mother's Milk CD, which contains additional verses and an extended bridge. In this version, Kiedis' vocals are more prominent.The song is featured as a master track in Guitar Hero: On Tour. The word 'high' is censored, even though it is not referring to drug use.Lyrics:Never too soon to be through.Being cool, too much too soon.Too much for me and too much for you.You're gonna lose in time.Don't be afraid to show your friends.That you hurt inside (inside).Pain's part of life don't hide behind your false pride...It's a lie.. your lie.Chorus- 2xIf you see me getting mighty,If you see me getting high,Knock me down.I'm not bigger than lifeVerse 2-I'm tired of being untouchable.I'm not above the love.I'm part of you and you're part of me.Why did you go away?Finding what you're looking forCan end up being, being such a bore.I pray for you most every day.My love's with you, now fly away.Chorus 2xInstrumental BreakChorus 6x-Woman singing-It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself.. it's so lonely. 4x

Red Hot Chili Peppers - Readymade (Album Version)

        Song Facts and Lyrics:On a DVD included in the Special Edition of Stadium Arcadium, Anthony Kiedis explains that this song is "much closer to the other three hearts in the band" and that it came from a place that he never had understood, and Flea agrees. This is mostly because of the intricate rhythms included in the drumbeat, and the heaviness of the bassline. John Frusciante also says that the main riff from the song was made by him while playing bass with his fingers. The band say that the chorus comes from a "face off".The song starts with the heavy bass line the song is built upon, and goes on with guitarist John Frusciante playing the riff along on a 1969 Gibson Les Paul Custom (one of the few times he has used a Les Paul for recording), followed by a deceptively simplistic drumbeat from Chad Smith, which almost unnoticably shifts the beat every 4 bars during the verse. What follows is one of the heaviest tracks on the album. The bassline for "Readymade" also carries similarities to the bassline for "Mountain Song", by the alternative band Jane's Addiction. However, it should be known, Flea can be heard on the track "Idiots Rule", from the same album, playing in the horn section, and Dave Navarro, guitarist for Jane's Addiction, is a former member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, so this could just be creative influence.Just before Frusciante sets in the song's solo, Kiedis shouts "Clean it up, Johnny!", which received much enjoyment in the band's fanbase. According to an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in 2006 this song was inspired by Johnny Ramone. On another lyric, Kiedis sings "I got a brother makin' trouble in the state of Caledonia." Caledonia is a suburb southeast of Kiedis' home town, Grand Rapids, Michigan.Lyrics:OohReadymade readymadesteady as the rhythm rollsreadymade readymadeand this is how the story goesI've gotta cousin making beatsdeep down in Arizonawe're gonna rocket to Ramone'sin the city of PomonaReadymade readymadesteady as the rhythm rollsreadymade readymadeand this is how the story goesChorus:And if I give to you mysecond sight you got itand if I stay the courseI'll stay the nightcome get itReadymade readymadebaby oughta celebratereadymade readymadeand now it's time to deviateI've gotta sister making babieswith a Black and Decker blow torchwe're gonna fop it all nightin the middle of the back porchReadymade readymadebaby oughta celebratereadymade readymadeand now it's time to deviateChorusReadymade readymaderockin' for the sake of sladereadymade readymadelisten but don't be afraidI've gotta brother makin' troublein the state of CaledoniaI wish I knew another waybut I'm gonna have to clone ya heyReadymade readymaderockin' for the sake of sladereadymade readymadelisten but don't be afraidChorus

        From their 1995 album One Hot Minute.(Lyrics)It started when we were little kids.Free spirits, but already tormented by our own hands given to us by our parents.We got together and wrote on desks and slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains and slipped through whatever cracks we could find,minds altered, we didn't falterin portraying hysterical and tragic characters in a smog filled universe. we loved the dirty city and the journeys away from it.We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves, chase tails round and round in downward spirals,leaving trail of irretrievable, vital life juice behind.Still, the brothersbloodcomradespartnerfamilycuzz was impenetrableand we lived inside itlaughing with no clothes, and everything experimental 'till death was upon us.In our face, mortality.And lots of things seemed futile then, but love and music can save us, and did, while the giant grey monster grew more poisoned and volatile around us,jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around. Nothing is the same.So we keep moving. We keep moving. (Ooooooooooooh Shit! Ooooooooooooh Shit!)Went off and got some hair cuts Lookin wild and got all drugged upHopped a train into the nightGot a ride with a transvestiteTwo boys in San FranciscoTwo boys in San FranciscoBlasted off in a Bart bathroomThose coppers woke us upThe mothersfuckers woke us upTwo young brothers on a hovercraftTelepathic love and belly laughsStorm the stage of UniversalSlim shine talk boy go subversalPapa's proud and so he sent usPounding hearts full and relentlessTwo boys in London, EnglandTwo boys in London, EnglandClimbing out of hostel windowsWearing gear so out but in thoughCome on kid and do the no noTwo young brothers on a hovercraftTelepathic love and belly laughs(Oooooooooooh Shit! Ooooooooooooh Shit!)We went to Fairfax High SchoolJumped off buildings into their poolsWe'd sit down and grease at CantersRun like hell they can't catch usTwo boys in L.A. properTwo boys in L.A. properStealin' anything that we couldGotta sneak into the StarwoodGotta peak into the deep goodI remember...10 years ago in HollywoodWe did some good and we did some real bad stuffbut the Butthole Surfers saidIt's better to regret something you didThan something you didn't doWe were youngAnd we were lookinglooki-i-inglooking for that deep kick...Seen 'em come, seen 'em go...(And I feel I'm getting close to you)Lead Vocals - Anthony Kiedis Lead Guitar - Dave NavarroBass - Michael "Flea" Balzary Drums - Chad Smith Percussion - Lenny Castro Producer - Rick Rubin

        One of the best songs from this album behind Tearjerker and Aeroplane.The last song from, their 1995 album "One Hot Minute".(Lyrics)You are my god, you are my dog,You kept me close, love never lost,I called you hippie, you said fuck off,Said you brothers a real punk rocker.Refrain:Somthings gonna happen,Somthing very soon,Transcending flesh could be a breezeSending me over the moon.Friends near death, you gave respect,Sympathetic intellect,Choices are, for one and all,All we are is, leaves that fall.Thats all.Always be loving you, now im away from you,Always be loving you.Round and round inside your head,Smartest fucker i ever met,Vicious fish bit at your toes,Made you lie and numb your soul.Refrain:Somthings gonna happen,Somthing very soon,Transcending flesh could be a breezeSending me over the moon.Mule donkey ass you bore a load Of all creations tortured soulsChoices are, for one and all,All we are is, leaves that fall.Like no other, i love you you're my brother.Like no other, i love you you're my brother.Like no other, i love you you're my brother.Like no other, i love you you're my brother.Like no other, i love you you're my brother.Like no other, i love you you're my brother.Water flowing and i will drink it,I will drink for you.A part of me left that only you knew,Will never be understood, will never be understood.Hey, gone to stay.Entire lifetime flash before me,In a loving stream.Hey mother May, I have lost a child,But she gave birth,To a loving stream.Ooh, never know. When the gods will come andtake you,To a loving stream.Ooh, heart of gold,The most special things you gave me wereFrom your loving stream.In a loving stream.Fuck the magazines,Fuck the green machine,See the human being, In a loving stream.Fuck the legal greed,Fuck the nothing scene, See the family,In the loving stream.

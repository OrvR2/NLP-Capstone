mfe's and steam will not keep up. they can't output enough to make that mass fab efficient. your best bet is isolating a large solar power base with the mass fab. if you have advanced solars than you should use them since they can produce a lot of power. of course it won't work during the night cause your best bet is just not even putting an MFSU between the solars and the mass fab cause hat throttles it down. of course it can't run at night though. do some math for the solar. don't blow it up.

I don't care who she dates, she can date anyone cause she is an "It Girl". You know...the one that has personality plus. That quality that draws you in and﻿ win over men and women alike. Self-confidence and indifference whether you are pleasing or not, and certainly never cold. Plus, Taylor Swift has a touch of class mixed with femme fatale and ingenue.
Along the same line s as Greta Garbo, Aubdrey Hepburn, Clara Bow, Lauren Bacall, Reba McEntire, and Dolly Parton to name afew.

'm a better musician. I'm a vocalist, multi-instrumentatlist, composer, who is self-taught but I had 20 yrs of training. I trained at Curtis, rating higher than Julliard in the US. It's the premiere music school in the US I taught﻿ myself many things but I know it takes years of extreme hard work, training and creativity to be excellent at music. The commercial world is so out of it. They don't think it﻿ takes extensive training. It takes self-education and extensive training.

All of you please stop being mean to Taylor, she has only had 6 boyfriends and if high school counts maybe 8, but seriously most﻿ of the boyfriends you say are rumors. I have a question: What has she done to you personally haters? Has she ever said something mean to you,kick you ignore you? NO! So you have no right to hate her.

WHO THE HELL CARES WHO SHE DATES! IT'S HER LIFE... my god if someone was in your business 24/7 it would annoy you to no end. She didn't sign up for this. It's all about the music man, that's all it's ever suppose to be about and then people try to get in everyone's personal life and become nosy. Who cares who she dates, it's not affecting my﻿ life.
Just enjoy the music and stop worrying about what she's doing and who she's doing it with. She's certainly not worrying about us :)

Taylor Swift is awesome!she is who she is!and thats good enough! Taylor has inspired many, and who cares if she goes out with guys, its not like she broke the law! I think its quite clever the way she opens up her love through her songs, she writes about them ﻿ but will not expose who its bout cuz it would keep ppl guessing.She is pretty, unique & i just love her personality,its so darn cute.No matter what Taylor does, I will always love her! She is funny,smart, & im glad to call myself a swiftie

If you read this, I love you. I have no idea how to go about doing this, somebody said if I want to get myself out there I should just post my videos on a bunch of other popular videos. Basically, I'm a 20 year old female singer-songwriter from S.A., music is my passion and it would mean the WORLD to me﻿ if you could find five minutes of your time to check out my page, listen, subscribe, share etc. (if you like my music of course) please help me achieve my dreams!

I'm a better musician. I'm a vocalist, multi-instrumentatlist, composer, who is self-taught but I had 20 yrs of training. I studied at Curtis, rating higher than Julliard in the US. It's the premiere music school in the US﻿ I taught myself many things but I know it takes years of extreme hard work, training and creativity to be excellent at music. The commercial world is so﻿ out of it. They don't think it takes extensive training. It takes self-education and extensive training.

I may not be the perfect singer but I know I have the talent. If you could please help me out by checking my channel out and let me know what you think? Feedback is always great! Please thumb this comment up/share my videos if you'd like so everyone can see it. THANK YOU and God bless (: †

Well the﻿ funny thing is.. Its LOVE! You can't do anything about it. You can fall in love with anyone whether you seek it or not. But eventually everyone goes through the phase where they fall in love more than once. There's never truly a "break" in love. Even when you break up with a certain person, a little part of you will always love them no matter how hard you try to move on.

How can their be different types of love? Love is just love. Its how you interpret with that love but honestly there's no different kinds of love. Yeah maybe you can live without a boyfriend or girlfriend but what if you fall﻿ in love without wanting to? What if love has many twists and turns but yet you risk it? Taylor isn't perfect and relationships aren't perfect either. Love just happens, you can't do anything about it. If i were cheated on there'd be a part of me deep down that would care.

I looked it up and found out she had 13 boyfriends in her life don't you think that is a lot?
She just broke up with Harry Styles just after a few weeks..
I just think its kinda ignoring that she always pops up with a new man it a bad example for little girls because there are little girls﻿ looking up to her.

Taylor Swift has gone out with six﻿ guys since 2008.
Jake Gyllenhaal, Joe Jonas, Taylor Lautner, John Mayer, and Conor Kennedy. Most recently, Harry Styles. That is not 13 boyfriends.

there's a big difference between going on same dates with someone and being in a serious relationship (meaning being boyfriend&girlfriend).
Taylor is, in my opinon, doing what loads of people her age are doing, which is going on dates, putting yourself﻿ out there and getting to know new people. that's perfeclty normal when you're a young adult.

There is a difference between going on a date with someone and actually dating someone...maybe she's dated a lot of people, but I would guess that the number of people she's really been with (John Mayer being the first) is 3 or 4. Which is not a lot by﻿ many standards...cut her some slack, she's just a young woman trying to figure out life!

I'm a better musician. I'm a vocalist, multi-instrumentatlist, composer, who is self-taught but I had 20 yrs of training. I studied at Curtis, rating higher than Julliard in the US. It's the﻿ premiere music school in the US I taught myself many things but I know it takes years of extreme hard work, training and education to be excellent at music.You probably won't listen to my music and send me a message that I won't read. The commercial world is so out of it. They don't think it takes training

A true Swiftie wouldn't judge Taylor by her hair, they would support anything she does, and stand by her no matter what she decides to do. We didn't come here for her hair anyway, so what was the point of that﻿ comment? Just get over all of the "changes", and listen to her music. She's still beautiful.

BUT know that all I'm here to do is spread my love for music with people who share the same passion.

If you like her music, you might like mine. You might not, and that's fine too! :P

I love this song and all the other song I have heard from this album. It is like she sings about what happens in my life, I mean, when I listen to her songs all I can think﻿ about is: "God! I lived something like this." :D
You are amazing <3 :)

I loved her older country songs. At this point, there are many things that I do like about her and many things that I don't like. She has become less than my favorite and mediocre but she is trying to find out where she stands with her music style. I respect that...oh, and that purple dress looks gorgeous on her. Lovely voice too﻿ :)

Hey guys! I was wondering if you could stop by my channel and check out some of my videos! It would mean soooo much! My dream is to become a musician, I have been told so many times that I "can't, shouldn't, won't" be able to do that. Every time somebody says something﻿ it gives me that much more strength to go and prove them wrong. All i am asking is for you to check out my channel! Thank you guys so much from the bottom of my heart it means the absolute world, and remember you CAN! <3

Kudos Taylor! This video made my heart melt! I didn't know you are the most charitable celebrity of 2012. Kudos again! You are an awesome role model to all of us with an open heart! The media, like children, can be so cruel in judging every aspect of one's life. Hello!! We are all human so you dating 6 guys in 5 years is completely normal. I love everyone of your songs. Thank you for being such an awesome inspiration! Have a blessed day everyone. ﻿ :)

I don't hate her, but I don't like her. You can say that I dislike her, I'm not a Swiftie or what ever, but I did like her from the starting. She was a country writer and now she makes songs about her break ups, I'm dont want to get hate just cause I said that, but she has changed alot. She﻿ is a country girl and always will be. I'm a Directioner and yes I hated the Haylor rumor, but I know that what makes Harry happy makes me happy. Nh

Hey guys! I was wondering if you could stop by my channel and check out some of my videos! It would mean soooo much! My dream is to become a﻿ musician, I have been told so many times that I "can't, shouldn't, won't" be able to do that. Every time somebody says something it gives me that much more strength to go and prove them wrong. All i am asking is for you to check out my channel! Thank you guys so much from the bottom of my heart it means the absolute world, and remember you CAN! <3

To any of you stupid people who are hating on Taylor cause you think that she has dated "20 guys in a year blablabla!'11!11" She has ONLY dated six guys since 2008. And for a 23 year old successful singer, that is not a lot. Just because she writes songs about love does not mean that she has had a million boyfriends. And to me, it's sad that her personal life is the one that makes it﻿ on the top of newspapers and not the fact that she is the most charitable celebrity of 2012, etc.

She's dated enough for someone who's considered to be so sweet and innocent. If the "only 8" men broke up with her, maybe she should consider the fact that she is the problem and not them and stop writing songs that are supposed to make﻿ them feel miserable for dumping her.
And stop assuming that everyone who doesn't agree with your opinion is stupid.

I don't want to argue or anything, but I just want to say that we really don't know a thing about her personal life, even if we﻿ think we do, and I think that you should not judge people that you know nothing about. I don't think she writes songs to make them feel bad, but to make herself feel better. Getting it out, you know, instead of keeping it all in. I do the same, otherwise I would drown in my own emotions. And who knows, maybe she's not as innocent as we would like to think :P

did i say that everyone who doesn't agree with my opinion is stupid? no. i just said that people who hate on her﻿ for no reason are stupid, and she has written a song like maybe i'm the problem, listen to Back to December. she's not called sweet and innocent because of the amount of guys she dates, but because of all the charity work she does and influential music she writes. Listen to Ronan.

That's my point! That's why I get so irritated with the music industry and people who are so gullible. (i.e. you liking taylor swift.) It's all about popularity and hardly any talent! I swear, you shit on a﻿ paper plate and call it art and you will buy it. You obviously have no love for music!

well that's also your opinion. just because you don't like her music doesn't mean that she can't sing or that her music sucks. that's what you think, and i have nothing against it. i'm just against people sending her death threats and﻿ hating her for absolutely no reason. she has done nothing wrong to deserve all these hate. she is a beautiful person inside and out.

I'm a better musician. I'm a vocalist, multi-instrumentatlist, composer, who is self-taught but I had 20 yrs of training. I studied at Curtis, rating higher than Julliard in the US.﻿ It's the premiere music school in the US I taught myself many things but I know it takes years of extreme hard work, training and education to be excellent at music.You probably won't listen to my music and send me a message that I won't read. The commercial world is so out of it. They don't think it takes training

Taylor is amazing. Once again, she has made a beautiful song! I love everything about her! Could anybody take a moment to check out my covers and channel? I made a mashup of Stay Stay Stay and Treacherous. It would mean the whole entire world to me if you checked one out! I am sorry for being such a spammer but am just trying﻿ to find ways to spread my music. Thanks for the seconds you took to read this! Help me get one step closer to my dreams!
Much love,

Hello everyone :)
I know most of you probably pass up these kind of comments, but for those who are still reading this, thanks!
I don’t have any money for advertisements, no chance of getting heard, nothing. I live in such a small town...
If this comes off as spam, sorry.
I’m an instrumental songwriter from Columbus, Mississippi. Please go to my channel and check out my original music.
It would be highly appreciated if you thumbs up this comment so my﻿ music can be heard!
Thank you,

To people who are saying fame is a bad thing, you don't want to be like her, or you do﻿ wanna be like her. She is herself, you are you.

So on her first album her last song was Our Song and I remember reading on her website that she put that as her last song so her fans﻿ could sense the lyric 'Play it again' so they could play the album again. And now on RED, Begin Again is the last song and Begin Again really means to begin the album again!

you think losing your privacy is easy? do you think its easy having everything you do picked apart and﻿ critised? do you think its easy to give up things that people take for granted... like finishing highschool properly... getting to spend time with friends and family.... having a normal realationship? being famous is not easy and its more of a curse than anything.

She also forgot the space﻿ between every comma, and that you can't start a sentence with "and". It's grammatically incorrect.

Only by the fact u're here talking bad about a person u've never met, becomes u a horrible person By the way, for what reason, to start the conversation, you entered this page if you do not like Taylor? It was only because you thought "I'm bored. Oh, I'll huff any singer for no apparent reason"

Pretty apparent that the﻿ majority of Taylor fans are idiots who lack both math, spelling and grammar skills. If you want to defend her get your facts right and at least type in fluent English. Please and thank you, sweetheart. Fucking bunch of retards.

If you do not realize, "darling", I wrote it wrong purposely. But,yes, I'm not fluent on the English because i'm a fucking brazilian. And I'm not Taylor fan. I just like some of her musics. ﻿ But i'm getting so fucking tired of all the shit of yours ficam falando. Not only about her, but about anyone that you NOT known.

She didn't date Brandon Borello, Sam Armstrong, Lucas Till, Cory Monteith, Eddie Redmayne or Zac Efron. ALL RUMOURS! Do your research.﻿

haha.. and why do﻿ i suddenly smell bullshit? if you really were you would be under a binding contract that would actually stop you from saying things like that. also i'm not saying shes an innocent sweetheart. i'm just saying that you don't know what she has done with all of them. afterall apparently half the reason why those guys stopped dating her was because she wouldn't put out.

What's wrong with her changing boyfriends? So she's supposed to stay single after breaking up with one guy who made her miserable? She's just purely moving on to find the right﻿ one. Mind your own business before judging others. Dumbfuck.

I’m a 19 year old aspiring musician, and at the moment I’m uploading cover songs mainly (but just uploaded my first original!). It would mean the world to me if you could take a look.
Please give me a chance to make my dream come true!

All you little kids are so dumb...this song is about her meeting a new guy in a cafe on a Wednesday after she broke up with a guy she﻿ dated for 8 month, which was a dead-end relationship. She fell in love again. She compares how her ex didn't like when she wore high-heels and didn't think she was funny.

my name is Diedra (yes, Dee-draw,) from Canada,﻿ and I'm a new beauty guru here. I'd love if you would check some of my videos out, possibly even﻿ subscribe?
It sucks being stuck in a sea of gurus, and its even harder to try and get my name out there.
I work extremely hard, I use a full HD camera, and I have a burning passion for this. I would appreciate your support so much, I don't think you understand lmfao.
I mean, even if you don't, I understand, not everyones gonna like me, right? haha.

I accept your opinion and I too am not a giant swiftie, but please﻿ don't put down the fans of Taylor Swift just to get your point across. Can't we just enjoy Youtube and all it has to offer without someone getting into a fight about their opinion. Same for Swifties. Don't tell the non- Taylor Swift fans that they are stupid just for not having the same opinion. Please.

Dearie - I can say whatever I like. But I will bet you Taylor will not be around in another five years and that's because her lyrics will not mature and her fans will out grow her. Taylor is a silly little girl who bangs WAY too﻿ may guys. And please point out where I called anyone stupid. Thank you.

♫I know someone will see this <333
I’m sure you pretty much hate these dumb comments
But it means the world to me…
My dream is to be a singer and to get noticed…
So many people out there are getting there chance so why not me?
I﻿ know I’m not the best but I want this more than to breathe…
If you could possibly take a few seconds to view a video of mine it would mean the world
Could you possibly thumb this up so others can see?
I Love you all so much!!

That's a rather pointless outlook on things, that's a waste of who﻿ you are. You'd be effectively killing everything good about you from this world. There is already a Taylor Swift, there wouldn't be you if there were two.

CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?? THANK YOU. Look, i get it, everyone hates these,﻿ 9 out of 10 of you won't even read this but hear me out. Im a 16 year old rapper from L.A. and im just trying to let my music be heard. I'm pretty poor so i can't really afford to buy views etc. that's no way to go anyway. It's hard to get heard, walk around the streets spreading your name but you never know if people are actually gonna take you seriously. If you have time Check Me Out.. again thnk u 4 the time.

Hi. :)
Most of you won't read﻿ this, and ignore it as spam. But I just wanna inform the listeners who are keen to hearing upcoming talent that I'm a young 14 year old rapper trying to chase his dream.
If you could listen to my rendition on Swimming Pools - Kendrick Lamar, that would be amazing.
Thank you!

It's missing the best part from the actual album when he starts rapping about how he's become an alcoholic and he considered himself a failure. Coming around﻿ to the fact that he's become corrupted.

I work my ass off 2 make it in the music biz, but its impossible 2 make it if
nobody ever hears you, and its hard to get people to hear you when you have
no exposure. I dont have the money for amazing music videos or big youtube

Do people not realize this song isn't about getting drunk﻿ all the time and partying? It's about how that lifestyle almost ruined Kendrick's life.

Hello everyone! :)
I'm a rapper from Brooklyn, New York
I'm 17 years old and I've been writing and recording for about two years
I'm an indie artist, and it’s very hard to get views but nothing gets me more hyped than making music. It’s my passion!
It would make my day if one of you could come through and listen?
Maybe you'll like it maybe not, but at least a view is what i'm hoping for..
Could﻿ you please help me along the road with a Big THUMBS UP?
Thank you all!!

Kendrick Lamar is officially the SHIT in my book. Kinda rhymes like tech nine, with swagger. I could listen to this song all day and it never gets old. Keep coming up with them hits my dude, and i'll keep listening. Coming from﻿ a New Yorker who lives and breathes hip hop, that's what's really good!

It's a fact no "anti-racists" in Africa are telling Africans they have no right to patrol their borders and kick out illegal immigrants.
It's﻿ a fact no "anti-racists" in Asia are telling Asians that mixed race people are better, and they should all mix together in Asia.
"Anti-racists" ONLY do this in White countries. They promote the genocide of my people, White people.
That's why anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.

Or you can wait to be picked-up... People like Drake, J. Cole, Nicki Minaj, 2 Chainz,﻿ Big Sean and plenty of other artists got discovered by people who own record labels (I.e. Kanye, Wayne, etc.) They did it by distributing demos or posting their music to MySpace.

Hey everyone. I'm a 16 year old rapper from Indiana and I could REALLY use the views, support, and feedback from you all. I can't really afford music videos, advertising, paying for views ect so I have to so called "SPAM". It's hard to get noticed without any exposure so please help me by listening to my songs and by taking 2 seconds of your time to go and like this comment. FEEDBACK IS ENCOURAGED. Thanks :D﻿

Its not even a drinking song, the message is about the peer pressure and﻿ everyones influence to drink, its basically saying i don't want to drink, but they do, so i have too.

I'm saying that the only reason people think they enjoy drinking is because of the highly addictive nature of the drug. The drug makes you think it﻿ is your friend, when it really creates the need that it claims to satisfy. The first time I got drunk I remember thinking "What's so special about this? Why are people obsessed with this feeling?" I have never been as happy as I was before I started drinking and I will return to that state once I become free.

Hey everyone. I'm a 16 year old rapper﻿ from Indiana and I could REALLY use the views, support, and feedback from you all. I can't really afford music videos, advertising, paying for views ect so I have to so called "SPAM". It's hard to get noticed without any exposure so please help me by listening to my songs and by taking 2 seconds of your time to go and like this comment. FEEDBACK IS ENCOURAGED. Thanks :D

Hi, I'm sorry to have to spam you guys and I know that some people find it annoying. The only problem is I have to do this in order for me to acquire my dream and to get people to listen to my music. Now a days it is not as simple as just making a demo and sending it record labels they aint interested, that's were you﻿ guys come in to it. I ask that if your a fan of hiphop you come by my channel check out my music, give it a like, comment, and hopefully subscribe. Thank you in advance

Haha. I just think it's funny people speak of *insert favourite rapper* saving hip hop. I think﻿ if hip hop ever gets saved (whatever that means to begin with) it will be an effort by many people, not just one person... Next time i'll include a list of references in my speech, ok? ;)

Thats my whole point. Kendrick isnt doing shit for hip hop, so people need to stop hopping on﻿ his dick just because he raps about alcohol with bigger words than other rappers. I swear it was jus top comment "kendrick lamar saved hip hop". If anyone saves hip hop, meaning they bring good rappers into the mainstream, its going to have to be someone amazing. at this point the closest person would be Lupe Fiasco or Nas. Even Jay Z. Its not dead, but its dying.

except he's not a singer. i dont give a shit about his voice. i care about his flow, lyrics, metaphors, style, etc. he could make himself sound like he's on helium for﻿ all i care.
and i enjoyed his live performance on SNL. this song should speak to a lot of people because of the cultural norms about alcohol.

No I am listening. "pool full of liquor and you dive in it" and "One chopper 100 shots two chopper 200 shots" with a half naked girl dancing in the video while he's wearing 5﻿ different chains. Im watchin and listening. He's doing exactly what i said. He's rapping about alcohol, and guns in a more intelligent way. He's still teaching the youth its ok to drink and its ok to fuck around with guns, and that isnt saving hip hop its destroying it.

right coz back then there werent any songs﻿ about guns and drinking that didnt become popular nationwide, ill take songs that tell you how the fuck life is any day, this is what ppl do with alcohol i wonder how many genres you would consider to be destroyed if you follow the same standards of criteria as you did with this song.

Ok first of all. I didnt say everyone back in the day was doing good for hip hop, theyre the ones that motivated all the shit rappers we﻿ have today, it all started somewhere. I was talking about the GOOD rappers, and i know all rappers have an image to uphold so they do all rap about that shit to some point but these are the ones that rap about it non stop. You cant defend kendrick lamar for what hes rapping about, because its shit weve been taught not to do when we grow up.

im not defending him he doesnt need defending from anyone im just saying what the song represents and how you have made this about hip-hop and less about the meaning of the song which is our alcoholic culture, but for you to say that this is wrong because your parents told you not to do what he talks about in the song is the lamest excuse ive heard, adults make their own decisions so fucking let them dont stifle them for the sake of your views and dont condemn a whole genre for it. enough﻿ said.

I with the Argentinian. In the end, flow isn't what REALLY matters. It always boils down to lyrics. Kendrick is trying to raise the consciousness of the mainstream. I'd rather listen to a song warning me about the dangers of Alcoholism than Tupac, JayZ and Biggie tellin' me how﻿ many hoes they got and how many people they shot.

yeah but tupac and biggie also had songs about respecting your mother and telling people to stay out of the ghetto. Honestly the kind of people that listen to mainstream music wouldnt understand that kendricks trying﻿ to warn them about alcohol, they would think hes promoting it. You need to analyze the lyrics to understand that and they dont. Jay Z also has songs about stayin out of the ghetto and real shit. ontop of all that they can actually flow, kendrick is terrible

Doesn't matter if Tupac, Biggie or Jay Z had a couple songs with uplifting lyrics. You may write a song or two respecting your mother, and on the same album rap about banging hoes and﻿ killing cops and rival gang members. You can say all you want about rappers like Drake and Li'l Wayne (which I also hate), at least they don't perpetuate violence and killing in their music like Jay Z and Tupac did back in the day.
Rappers like Kendrick and Lupe are bringing conscious rap to the mainstream.

lol lil wayne doesnt perpetuate violence? What lil wayne do you listen to? because the one i hear raps about "choppers" (AK47's) and just as much killing as other rappers. And i know drake seems like a soft rapper but even he raps about killing and﻿ violence. The whole attitude that a rapper has to give off is of violence and toughness. If they dont theyll get eaten up by other rappers, but then there are those that dont care about money and rap about real things and dont care about other rappers

Little wayne may be all artsy with his lyrics, but if you go back to the beginning, he's probably killed (or eluded to killing) about a million BLACK people so far, in his lyric of course. Its a damn shame that these handful of fools can niggerfy a whole genre of music and perpetuate the initial goal of the KKK to destroy all non whites, however by letting us kill ourselves through music.. I just hope some people just wake the hell up..

You're judging the song on its﻿ flow. If Kendrick wanted it to flow, he would have. Kendrick didn't release this song with the hopes of it gaining popularity through flow, he was aiming for it to preach a message - which he has done very well. Stop judging the song on something it didn't intend to do.

yeah this song is about alcoholism. but if you listen to the song, you realize that he raps about the problems with alcoholism.
"one chopper 100 shots" = comparing shots of a gun from shots of alcohol
"some people want to fit in with﻿ the popular. that was my problem" = peer pressure
the hook is about him sipping his liquor but people pressuring him into getting hammered. there's even a line about him getting poisoning because his conscience tells him its ok.
but all you heard was "DRANK" lol

no ur not. the "pool full of liquor" part and the whole chorus is supposed to be what other people tell him "then somebody said to me..." . listen to the first verse more carefully and youd see that. And since when does wearing chains make you destroying hip hop? Biz Marqie and other old school rappers who STARTED hip hop wore tons of chains. ﻿ So maybe ur listening but not well.

So your logic is that if they sing about things that are bad for kids then they aren't good for hip hop? So what about NWA? A group that took hip hop to another level. Hip hop wouldnt be nearly as big as it is without them. Dre, Cube, Eazy? That's the FOUNDATION of hip hop we're talking about and they had songs such as "F#*k The Police" and songs like with chorus' suchs as "she swallowed it" where the whole song starts with an audio clip on how to suck a d#*k...your logic﻿ is completely flawed

Ok, I see where you're coming from, but my point was why do all the stupid motherfuckers who think kendricks the "second coming of tupac" or that hes "the saviour of rap" really think hes going to do anything better for hip hop. If he really wanted to SAVE hip hop he wouldnt be making a song like this, and secondly, i know every artist makes a song﻿ like that, as i said they have a title to uphold, but the artists in the mainstream mass release songs like this.

and what are you trying to prove listing people from NWA ofcourse they have songs like that, theyre from the ghetto that was their whole image, to be gangster. Don't tell me you still think eminem ONLY releases bad songs, he reaches out to kids now﻿ and helps them. And you're right but NWA also influenced all these stupid rappers today, which is the REASON hip hop is fucked up. Dre practically made the mainstream artist lineup single handedly and thats why its fucked up.

and i also didnt say theyre not good for hip hop if theyre not good for children, i said if they want to﻿ be known as the saviours of hip hop then they shouldnt be doing the exact same thing everyone else is doing. If kendrick wants the title of "the saviour of hip hop" he has to earn it, not fucking rap about liquor and guns. The whole concept is saving hip hop, and i wont lie dre's songs are good but hes the one that fucked it up to begin with. Plus kendrick has a horrible voice and flow.

PART 1: Alright, it looks like you won't get it until it's all laid out for you buddy so here it is. It's a long explanation but it's necessary to understand these things to understand the song:
Very first verse sets up what alcohol addiction is like. Drinking﻿ booze is just integrated into every single part of your life and even to do the most mundane things to just get out of bed or whatever ditch you passed out in, you need alcohol. Now look at this, you use alcohol as a hangover remedy

PART 5:
to swim to the top but it’s exhausting and you keep sinking down and eventually you will drown. It’s alcohol so it stings your eyes, you won’t be able to see and expect to get alcohol poisoning faster than you can admit that you’re an alcoholic. It’s EFFING horrible to be swimming in a pool of liquor! Any﻿ sane person can see that except…the alcoholic can’t. Not only that but there’s things that are covering up his senses from the fact that he’s dying a slow, horrible death in that pool

PART 6
of booze: being popular with the ladies (let’s face it, who’s gonna turn down free booze?), having more confidence, hanging out with other men and women who are also diving into their own pools of liquor. But then, we get the second verse where Kendrick Lamar’s conscience wakes up and pleads desperately for him to let go of the alcohol because at this rate, he’s going to DIE! He’s “drowning in some poison, abusing [his] limit” but despite KNOWING this is wrong and unhealthy, he﻿ continues.

PART 7:
Why? Yeah the verse says “I think that I’m feeling the vibe/ I see the love in her eyes, I see the feeling/ The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived.” So someone who takes those lyrics at face value and don’t use their brains think: oh! This guy just wants some hot chicks to love him and he’s having a grand old time getting hammered!...and yeah, that is it! He wants to be desired, to be loved and he wants to be free﻿ from his worries and issues! But…the only way

PART 8:
way he feels he can do that is by getting drunk. How sad and unglamorous is it that it’s only when he’s drunk and his own cells are dying in poisonous alcohol that he can see the love in her eyes that he can feel free? It’s sad. If it wasn’t clear before, it is now: He is completely addicted to alcohol to feel how a normal person should feel! He ignores his conscience and he’s now fully following in the footsteps of all the alcoholics he saw as a kid (“This is parental advice…”) ﻿

PART 9:
But now it gets even darker…he thought he was already “doing the most”﻿ (basically he thinks he’s at rock bottom) but apparently, you an go lower. How can you go lower than being a full blown alcoholic? You can bring gang violence and weapons into the mix. You can bring your friends down with you. You can find another alcoholic buddy that helps you get pulled down further.

PART 10:
That’s where the verses about shots and bullets that got you up in a tizzy came in. The ones that go: “One chopper, one hundred shots bang…etc.” This theme of gang violence will be touched upon again later in the song.
After this point, I’ll use some of the lyrics from the FULL song. This song is actually not the complete song and there is﻿ more that will probably help you understand the music video better.

PART 11:
But wait, you’re bothered by something else specific﻿ in the music video, right? You wrote about “a half nakedgirl dancing in the video”…but let’s take a look at the lyrics of the next hook and bridge. It goes: “Aw man, where is SHE taking me/ where is SHE taking me.” Who is “she”? You can interpret “her” as being alcohol. Suddenly, that beautiful seductive woman in the music video is something else…

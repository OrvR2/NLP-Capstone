4daysagoReport: Syria President Assad announces wife Asma is pregnantSyrian Arab News Agency via EPASyrian President Bashar al-Assad, photographed here with wife Asma al-Assad in February 2012, announced that she is pregnant with their fourth child.By Isolde Raftery, Staff Writer, NBC NewsA fawning profile of Syrian President Bashar Assad Monday revealed, as an aside to the larger story, that his wife Asma Assad is pregnant with their fourth child.Follow @NBCNewsWorld
 “The man seems calm and in control,” the al-Akhbar article says of Assad, whose country has been embroiled in a bloody civil war for 22 months. “His confidence level stands out. Also, there’s the news of the pregnancy of his wife Asma, which could not be dealt with as a simple personal matter between a couple.”Asma Assad, 37, was born in London to upper-class Syrians. She was an investment banker before leaving England for Syria, where she married Assad two months after he assumed the presidency in 2000. Before him, his father Hafez Assad ruled the country for 30 years.

Asma Assad has not been seen recently – which Arab online news site Al Bawaba attributes to her pregnancy. Citing a Syrian news outlet, Al Bawaba reports that she was five months pregnant in November, which means her due date is imminent.This also means she likely became pregnant in June, a remarkably violent month for Syria. United Nations monitors left the country that month because it was deemed too dangerous, and because Assad had refused to abide by cease-fires.Eight thousand people had been killed in the conflict – the death toll is currently at 60,000, the U.N. estimates – and Syrian citizens were fleeing for the country’s borders. Thousands were leaving each day; now tens of thousands are leaving, most at night, dodging fire from Assad's troops.Asma Assad had also become a controversial figure, with diplomatic wives around the world pleading with her to reason with her husband. Around the same time, a hacker had released thousands of emails from the Assads’ email accounts, revealing Asma Assad’s love for Chanel dresses and crystal-encrusted Louboutin shoes – and also her fierce loyalty to her husband and his hard-line approach. The European Union then slapped her with sanctions, saying she could no longer travel to Europe or shop at European companies.Vogue, meanwhile, had taken down a glowing profile of Asma Assad from 2011 – titled “A Rose in the Desert.” The Vogue piece, which is still available on a website dedicated to President Assad, begins: “Asma Assad is glamorous, young and very chic – the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies.” Explore related topics: syria, bashar-al-assad, asma-al-assad

If the terrorists win, NATO will ensure she and the baby are also killed. All you fools out there keep falling for the "he's killing his own people" and "they just want democracy" propaganda. Everywhere the USA & it's NATO puppets go, they leave a big mess behind and 10's or 100's of thousands of deaths. Dream on you bunch of lemmings and let the "gummit" tell you exactly what you will or will not believe.5 votes#4.1 - Tue Jan 29, 2013 1:05 AM ESTbob-1474624The United States or NATO for that matter has nothing to do with the mess in Syria. That damned place had problems long before the as you call them terrorist started to fight against Assad. Funny, I though when the Son took over the country from his father a period of peace and prosparity would come to the region but that did not happen. He will fall like the former leader of Libya without the "help" of the U.S. or NATO. Get your facts straight pal before you make stupid comments. 8 votes#4.2 - Tue Jan 29, 2013 2:25 AM ESTstratocumulusIf what you say is true, ZH, the US would have used its military by  now--like it did with Afghanistan & Iraq.

If the US wanted to go into Syria, it wouldn't give a rat's  hiney what Russia or China or Iran had to say--it would smoke Assad and  his bull**** regime in two seconds.  You're the one who's dreaming, ZH. 
"Nato will ensure she and the baby are also killed" --what  kind of twisted view of the world do you have?  What kind of propoganda  are you listening to?  Granted, Afghanistan and Iraq are a mess, but  even Bush--may he never return--didn't deliberately set out to murder  women and children.  He was foolish, not a psychopath. 
Tyrants like Assad on the other hand, will shell villages full of pregnant women in order to stay in power.9 votes#4.3 - Tue Jan 29, 2013 2:51 AM ESTStephen Sargent.Basha's mother has gone to Dubai to settle down with Basha's sister and kids, probably husband also. Basha, Asthma and the 4.5 kids will be there soon.  They are all lucky enough to have the money to purchase a 'little pad' or five to settle down in, rather than hang around and choke on the dust and rubble of what will be left in Damascus, Hams, Homma, Aleppo, etc etc etc etc.
The Karzai family and cronies from Afghanistan have also planned their escape to Dubai, for when the $hy&e hits the fan in 2014,,, next year.
Dubai will take anyone, yes anyone, because power and money made the kitsch, tacky and tasteless place what it is, tacky and kitsch.
The history of the Gulf States when they discovered oil, (except Oman). reads like this,  
They fell off their camels into Rolls Royces,
They crawled out of their tents into Hilton Hotels.
Just like Ma, Pa Clampett and the kids when they went to Hollywood after the black oil spewed out of the hills.
the world still spins, for some, the wrong way.6 votes#4.4 - Tue Jan 29, 2013 4:22 AM ESTKeith Pittell... Freaking Chinese baboon...

They along with other oil rich Sunni rulers of Qatar, Kuwait, UAE and other Sunni Arab League nations invented the most extremist Sunni Wahhabi and Salaffi versions; funded their hate preaching and killer training mosques all over the world and are involved in oil price manipulations to high levels by tricks like Iraqi wars, sanctions on Iranian oil and other means.
These Sunni Islamists are killing non-Muslims where they get them.
If they don't get non-Muslims, they are killing their own Muslims.
Syria is the best example.1 vote#4.7 - Tue Jan 29, 2013 10:27 AM EST

ZH must be drinking some kool-aid spiked with vodka. Poor fellow.6 votes#17.1 - Tue Jan 29, 2013 3:47 AM ESTWarLord72Strato stop talking about things that you don't even understand. America is supposed to be smart now since the flunky wars of Bush screwed us over. That means covert CIA and NSA help and support of the so called rebels with intelligence and small arms from our friends the Saudis and Turks. Truth be told This whole war stinks of the CIA I mean the Muslim Brotherhood showing up again out of nowhere to cause havoc and chaos in a stable country when they are supposed to be exiled? The fact that they were hiding and being treated like the best of party guests by Britain, France, and the U.S.? We are helping them more than you think. Besides I'll take a government over a rabble of bigots and ethnic tribes any day. You know already so many refugees identified many of these rebels as Jordanians, Iraqis, Libyans, and even Somalis? Also if it were true that Syria was a huge terror supporter wouldn't it's allies who know how to stop insurgencies of hopped the border and helped them by now. You need to read a lot of news from before the war happened so you can understand cause let me tell you about war. It is the perfect time to bury the truth with lies and propaganda. Here are a few for your knowledge. This war is supposedly about freedom and democracy? Funny how people suddenly speak for a power that has never been seen before on the sands of the Middle East. Afghanistan is not democracy, Iraq is not democracy anyone can see that especially the muslims. It is just the propaganda the CIA uses fight for freedom and we will help you build a better loving future. Yeah okay the second idea is that the people are impoverished sunnis that are not getting aid from the government because they are mostly poor dirt farmers and can't grow any crops. This is actually true because Turkey dammed up the waterways in the north so Syria is not getting it's irrigation water. Knowing this tell me should they be mad at Assad or the Turks?#17.2 - Tue Jan 29, 2013 10:47 AM EST

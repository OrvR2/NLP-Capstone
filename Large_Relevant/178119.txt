I notice the band, the ones who started it, were the first to make for the only exit - without warning the people about the fire over the PA system. They said they thought it was a small fire which would be quickly put out - so why did they head for﻿ the exit?

Looks like that door turns inward. Not good if you﻿ have a ton of panicked people behind you wanting to escape.

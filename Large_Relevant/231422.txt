"Care Less for Any Human" you say? Mr.La Pierre put all his cards down the line sitting on that chair fighting for YOURS, OURS, and every True Blooded Law Abiding, Tax paying, Hard Working American's Freedom rights, against tyrannical government that enslaves Citizen like YOU so crooked politicians can have a nice retirement check and an office with a view,﻿ while YOU fall victim to Criminals and psycho paths on that very "street" of yours. If Mr. La Pierre didn't care he wouldn't be there.

Wayne LaPierre 4 years ago was in favor of a "No Loop hole" back ground check for gun shows. In fact he said back then that the NRA invented the back ground check.
Now he is against it? Why? Because the gun manufacturers are against it, not because it makes any sense. Wayne is﻿ bought and paid for.

The 2nd Amendment states:
A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
It doesn't say the people should have nuclear weapons. It doesn't say they should even have hand grenades. But a good old shotgun and rifle﻿ and hand gun is great.
An assault rifle??? Give it to the Militia and keep it in the Armory.

How dare Wayne LaPierre refuse to give Lord﻿ Leahy the answer he demanded. By decree of Lord Leahy with power vested in him by our great beloved leader his majesty King Obama, Mr. LaPierre will now be placed on the terrorist watch list and no fly list, along with anybody else who has a similar sounding name.

Just as in the case of, say, asking, "Mr. Lapierre, do you still beat your wife, yes or no?" the answer cannot be contained in a one word response. Mr. Leahy was asking an intentionally misleading question and looking for an oversimplified answer that does﻿ not address the issue.

The NRA is not going to go for any new laws to include making background checks a requirement for all transactions. I do not believe banning guns will ever work because criminals will use the black﻿ market to buy guns. As for people who are violent, they will find another way to kill.

There should﻿ be background checks for ALL gun purchases. And most gun laws have been hobbled by intense lobbying from the NRA, like the fact that we have no ATF director and the fact that the Tiahrt amendment keeps the ATF from doing what the NRA says it wants done: enforce existing gun laws.

The ATF should be replaced by the NRA. The ATF allows straw purchasers to buy any and all weapons﻿ as long as they promise to give them to drug cartels supported by the DEA.

Should have replied NRA supports background checks for all sales going through a licensed dealer. Private sales are regulated by the states. We support the States that want to allow private sales and we also support the States that want to regulate them.
I'd take your question up﻿ with the State legislatures Senator. We don't believe Federal laws that violate the constitution should be the end all game plan if the states want to take over that area of regulation.

Straw purchases are illegal. Then why is Attorney﻿ General Eric Holder not in jail for purchasing automatic weapons and bomb making material for shipment across international border into Mexico. Mexico have a "No Gun" policy. Those weapons sold by AG Eric Holder were used in murder of innocent people and children. President Obama, why is an International mass murder like AG Eric Holder still on your executive staff?

Connecticut has﻿ had an "assault weapons" ban since 1993, and look what happened in Newtown
Chicago has the strictest gun laws in the country, and they have the highest gun homicide numbers in the country.
Look at Mexico; notice the pattern.

Mexico gets their firearms from us; I wouldn't﻿ say that has a snowball's chance in hell as a remotely decent argument. Chicago repealed their handgun ban in 2010, and THEN their homicide figures with guns began to skyrocket again. Neat. Conneticut? Yeah, it's not too hard to take firearms that are legal in one state and put it in one where it isn't.

Here's the problem with the federal government requiring a federal background check on private sales or transfers of guns. It will require all gun owners﻿ to register all of their firearms with the federal government. The federal government has no jurisdiction concerning the transfer of a firearm between two citizens inside of a free state. The list of registered guns will be used when the federal government starts banning them, one type at a time. Liberty will, and is, dying a slow death.

Ah yes, the profound logic of liberals: "full of shit" and "Uneducated sheep". What intellectual giants to say such things of fellow Americans whom you think should have no voice at all. Conservatives are second class citizens. You're ideas of tolerance and education have﻿ no basis in reality or objectivity.

Oh, what point, that I understand the difference between "your", "you're", "its" and "it's"? That I have the hubris to make that a general prerequisite before agreeing somebody isn't stupid enough to talk about guiding﻿ the fate of a nation? Shit man, I really proved that point. This is the same kind of bullshit as the rampant innumeracy you see in people who don't exactly have a penchant for statistical analysis taking a crack at gun control and vehicle deaths.

Attacking someone's education and intelligence because of a couple misspellings takes away from your argument and makes you sound small. And using words that are rarely used in common conversation in a debate tells me that you are interested in limiting diversity in your debate on a basis of education and not intelligence, while clearly making yourself feel elite. By the way, I'm smart enough and experienced enough with statistical analysis to have a conversation﻿ about traffic deaths and guns

Mmh? Oh, no, I just think if someone is going to be a hypocrite and flout education as such a big deal, they have to figure out grade school. Yes, you're totally right! I am using words that are rarely used, do you know why? Because there are longer words that can suffice to describe several small words! Isn't﻿ language awesome? You're even more right about limiting diversity in debate, spot on! If limiting those who use big words but can't seem to figure out possessives is limiting, hell yeah.

The Second Amendment was not written to allow yo to buy an arsenal. The Second Amendment was not a free give away of guns. The Second Amendment was not written to create an unorganized, uncoordinated civilian police force. And it was most definitely not written to let citizens attack their government or prevent an attack by their government.
And do not bother replying to this. I will﻿ not argue documented American history with you, or debate Founder quotes taken out of context.

That's right. The well regulated Militia for each state was there in case we needed to stop the government from going too far. Each State National Guard is there for our protection. They can have Tanks. They can have machine guns. They are﻿ "well regulated" and well trained. Everyday folks are not, but they can still own shot guns, rifles, and hand guns.

You're simply wrong as the Supreme court disagrees with you. You need to read the memoirs of our founding fathers. That will give you their exact emotions why they chose to include the 2A.
2A is there as the final check and balance against a govt trying to overbear﻿ the Constitution.
Also read the Unorganized militia act of 1903.

This is the lie. Gun shows already﻿ do checks, most of the time unless you know the guy selling the item. Just my own experiences after 300 shows over the course of my life.

The goal is to solve a problem and Senator Leahy wastes everyone's time and interest﻿ in trying to squeeze LaPierre into a "yes/no" answer in the attempt to squeeze gun owners into a corner which is not to anyone's benefit. There is no accurate yes/no answer to the situation.

Actually, it is as simple as a "yes"﻿ or "no" to these questions. The problem, however, is that nobody wants to hear the reasoning behind the "yes" or the "no" because by ignoring that part, you can put your own spin on those basic answers and that's what the uneducated sheep like.

The problem with a mandatory universal background check is that it will allow for records of all gun transactions to be kept indefinitely, which amounts to a de facto registration system, which then﻿ will be used for confiscation.
ALL gun registration systems have ultimately been used for confiscation... from Australia, to the UK, to NYC to California.

The vast majority of American civilians don't own "assault rifles"; very few do. The military are﻿ the ones with the select-fire/automatic assault rifles. What we have are merely semi-auto rifles -- but they're trying to lump them all together.
Semi-auto rifles have been involved in less than 3% of America's total gun-related homicides. There is no case for banning them.

We applaud President Obama for working with the UN to finalize proposals for his nationwide ban on all privately owned guns.
This ban not only helps thwart further mass-shootings, but ensures the safety, preservation and Continuity-of-Government in the event of unforeseen natural, financial or man-made﻿ calamities resulting in civil unrest, widespread anarchy and looting by minority groups.
Only Law Enforcement shall retain the current 'Right to Bare Arms' for population control and self-defense.

And don't take it wrong, we respect you for being a Veteran, any good cop would, but it's you guys who are supposed to be the most dangerous perps in all of this, and outside of all these mass shootings of late, one of the biggest reasons for planned rollout of a total nationwide gun ban, returning veterans.

Enforcing any law made that infringes on the 2nd Amendment or any other in the Bill of Rights means you are following an unlawful order. This means if you are law enforcement or military. You are attacking your own country by following those orders. It is your duty to recognize what is unlawful and stand down no matter who your superiors are. I find it highly ironic and insane that our government has identified the men and women who served in war as people who needs their rights taken away.﻿

Totally agree with you SeattleFightClub, Law Enforcement is just that ! enforces the laws. Police are just "law enforcing" puppets. That's they're job "enforce the law". Everyone Knows or Should know, police don't have legal obligation to protect citizens, something has to happen before police can act. Police just like citizens can hide﻿ a secret agenda as to Why they decided to be Police like a power tripping bully that's inside of them. Police themselves have mental issues inside of them.

By your logic.... laws against murder, theft, drunk driving, and battery only work with law-abiders. So what's the point of those laws right? Really, we shouldn't have ANY laws because they only work with law-abiding citizens. Law-breakers will always break laws so might as well let everyone in on criminal acts. Yeah... who's﻿ the moron now? You are.

You can make any semi auto into a full auto by simply﻿ "bump" firing it. Put your thumb in your belt loop, finger on the trigger and pull out on the stock with your left hand. It will fire all the bullets in your clip very quickly.
That's why a ban on large capacity clips is so important. Not so much the assault rifle.
And a no loop hole back ground check would be great. Go to a gun shop to get it and pay a small fee if it's a private sale.

if a person is so criminal as to be restricted from gun ownership, why is he allowed to be free﻿ in society?

A large reason the laws don't work now is because of the lobbying﻿ of the NRA to make gun laws weaker / unable to be enforced.

Send a shock wave to Dianne Feinstein and the extreme left. Sign the petition to repeal Senate Bill SBX211. When the entire Los Angeles Superior Court Judges face possible felony charges for excepting money that was NOT authorized by law. That should put them back on their heels for a while.
Google﻿ SBX211 and sign the petition.

How do criminals get guns? Why don't you ask around﻿ and see what politicians are doing with some of the military weaponry. Hmm. Seems logical to me.

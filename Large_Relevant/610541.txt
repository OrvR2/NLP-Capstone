Wow—Obese Kids’ Health Is Much Worse Than We ThoughtTakepart.com – Wed, Jan 16, 2013

We all know the number of American kids who are overweight or obese is at a scandalous rate (childhood obesity rates doubled between 1988 and 2006). But most of us might assume that the really bad health consequences of being very overweight will come later, in adulthood, when numbers for the big killers—heart disease, stroke, and diabetes—peak. And while that is true, there’s now new research showing a much bigger effect of excess weight on kids’ health when they are young.
The new study, which appeared in Academic Pediatrics, was led by Neal Halfon, MD, MPH, director of the UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families, and Communities, in Los Angeles. The research looked at over 43,000 kids ages 10 to 17 around the country and asked about kids’ health issues like asthma, diabetes, and pain, as well as developmental and behavioral issues.

The findings are sobering: “Common health conditions associated with obesity include ADHD, learning disability, poor dental health, asthma, allergies, and headaches,” wrote the study authors. The research, which surveyed parents, also found more ear infections and problems with bones, joints, and muscles in heavier kids.
Overall, say Dr. Halfon and his co-authors, kids who are obese have nearly twice the risk of having three physical, mental, or developmental problems compared to normal-weight children. Overweight kids had a 1.3 times higher risk.
One of the more shocking statistics was the finding that 11 percent of obese kids experienced some sort of restriction on how active they could be—like going to school or playing with other kids, says Halfon. “Obese children are limited in what they can do,” he says. “This is a measure of disability or impairment due to obesity. It’s the same kind of measure that would be used to determine if a child with heart disease or cerebral palsy was impaired in some way.”

Beyond physical problems, obese kids in the study also had significantly higher rates of problems at school, ADHD, depression, learning disability, and developmental delays. They were also likelier to repeat a grade. “Obesity may be associated with stigmatization, victimization, and isolation,” Halfon notes. “If you are obese, have ADHD, and difficulty reading social cues, and also cannot participate in PE because you have asthma as well, then you become ‘different’ and have a greater chance of being isolated.”
The research found something particularly interesting for diabetes: Kids who were 15 to 17 and obese were much likelier to be diabetic as they aged into adolescence. This, say the authors, suggests that the path to adult-onset diabetes “is well underway beginning in adolescence.” Type 2 diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death and is on the rise, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control.

We should all be worried about these findings, since the implications for so many kids with these issues is huge. “While there is some evidence that the rate of childhood obesity is slowing, the fact that close to 30 percent of children are obese or overweight, and that they are burdened with all kinds of conditions that can influence their long-term health, education, and life trajectories is of obvious concern,” says Halfon. And not just because of future healthcare costs. “These kids,” he stresses, “are at risk for not fulfilling their potential.”
Are you surprised to hear that obese kids are experiencing so many health problems in childhood? What do you think our best options are for lowering the rate of childhood obesity?

If people ate purely for physical reasons (the right food and in the right amount, slowly and focusing on eating) instead of emotional ones, we wouldn't have this problem.  Parents force food on their children instead of attention and involvement in the name of "love".  People need to get out outdoors more and watch less TV (less PC time as well).  These problems didn't exist 50 years ago because people ate less and were more active.  It's our own fault for being lazy slobs.

But obesity doesn't cause diabetes!! I hear time and time again from folk who call me ignorant for mentioning that it does!! Yet I can show them all kinds of sources which show the link. TYPE 2 diabetes, that is!! Not TYPE 1, The real disease!! Type 2 is a choice that these kids parents are making for them. Love how this isn't considered abuse in this country....

Fat is one thing, but the health problems that are coming at such an extreme rate are not the result of "a bad diet and no exercise" alone.  What the EFF are they putting in our food?!?  We KNOW that hormones are in our dairy products and many meats.  We KNOW that there are also various chemicals in both meat and on produce.  What effect is Genetically Modiifed food having on our systems?  We can't expect to eat "GMF" and not have it change our own structure: Food literally is our fuel and helps to build, repair, and maintain.

After 10,000 centuries of self-regulation (such as calling fat "fat"). It was far from perfect, but now look what we have after 2-3 decades of whatever the hell this is.

It's bad.  
I have to shield my eyes when I go to town.  I have a weak stomach, and could vomit if I see too many triple chins, or  a bunch of fat rolls hanging over a waistband.

There are many reasons for this horrible epidemic.  Many of the posters below mention one part of the problem.  The reasons are:

- Processed food and fast food is now abundant and cheap.  When I was a kid, fast food, soda, and other junk food was a rare treat.  Pizza night once a month, the other stuff, maybe a few times a year.  The rest of the time Mom cooked a balanced meal using real, whole foods.  It isn't hard to bake a chicken, boil some potatoes and steam some veggies and serve fresh fruit for dessert. 

- The poorest people do not have access or the means to purchase good food.  Many inner cities don't have grocery stores with fresh produce. Either way, #$%$ is cheaper than fresh veggies and meats.  The working poor don't have time to prepare stuff if they are working 3 jobs.  I will reserve judgement on the majority of food stamp users, but it does bother me that the government doesn't restrict their use to healthier foods, like the WIC program does. 

- Kids don't go outside to play any more.  Unless it was a blizzard or pouring rain outside, we ran around, rode our bikes, played on the swing set until the sun went down. 

- Food additives, chemicals, hormones and the evil High Fructose Corn Syrup. Big agribusiness found a way to process this waste product into a cheap sweetener. This stuff is NOT the same as sugar - it is processed through the liver, and doesn't go straight to the bloodstream like glucose or sucrose. Your body doesn't feel the effects right away, so you still feel unsatisfied and eat much more. 

- Too many hormones and chemicals have caused other changes in the body, in many cases damaging the thyroid and other glands that regulate our metabolism. 

Take all this and add to a lack of education regarding proper nutrition, you see a country of fat, sick people, and the first generation of children whose life expectancy is shorter than that of their parents.  Very sad, really.

Makes me sad and sick (as a parent of an extremely healthy, active 6 year old) to see children her age who weigh more than me. They can't play with their peers- the huff and #$%$ and wheeze and gasp for air after 30 seconds of running. Then they waddle to their moms who give them a damn soda and fries. Ruining our kids with all that processed #$%$ and lack of physical activity

It's really a tragedy to see obese kids. They're given a challenge for the rest of their life. Parents, feed your kids less (and healthier if affordable). Say no for their own sake!

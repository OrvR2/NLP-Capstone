If Qatar keeps pushing for our Second Amendment to be taken, I say we vote to invade them in the first Democratically declared war in history. Just because you have no rights and are ruled by an Emir does not give you a free pass to buy a US﻿ TV channel and to propagandize us into disarming, which you, or any Middle Eastern country talking about gun control is a joke, the human rights violations in your lands alone against women necessitate they be armed.

Gun control is just another way of saying the police and the government can have guns, while citizens are disarmed and left at the mercy﻿ of a bunch of badge wearing, gun toting, pieces of shit.

==
If the piece of shit can have the guns, that means the gun control is not working.
If you want the piece of shit to be disarmed, there you go you are a supporter of the gun control.
Or you want the piece of shit to be kept armed?

I guess i misread your original comment. I thought you were talking about thugs.
You are saying policemen are piece of shit, correct?
If so, who's going to protect the other citizens from those self righteous gun toting super heroes (likes of George Zimmerman)?
I fear those vigilantes more than policemen. At least we know who policemen work for.

It would be nice to have cops not have guns, but that type of legislation would never pass. I believe as long as you're not a criminal, or mentally ill, you should be﻿ able to bear as many arms as you wish.

What if the civilians have more guns and cops can't do anything about it?
How do you separate criminals from other people without back ground check?

USA the number 1 country in the﻿ world about number of guns per capita
percentage of guns﻿ in comparison with﻿ population:
1. USA: nearly 100% (300.000.000 guns for 315.000.000 people)
2. Yemen: 50%
3. Switzerland: 45%
.....Japan: 0.6%, and only 17 countries have a higher percentage than 25%
in Australia: year before gun control = 100 mass shootings;﻿ year after = 0

I think it's interesting﻿ that Americans believe its their right to have weapons but sanction wars with other countries that manifest that same belief. Anybody want another slice of hypocrisy pie before its all gone?

A coalition of 1000 green beret's announced by written proclamation two days ago they would not support any changes, interferences or alterations in the second amend, or obey unlawful orders in the removal of weapons from lawful owners...today the head of the national sheriffs assn followed suit. Speaking﻿ for sheriffs coast to coast plainly and directly stated the same message ....which means...either thats check and mate, game over, fuck u Washington ....or things are fixen to get nasty!!!....

Anyone who advocates gun control doe not believe in the 2nd amendment, as the definition of "infringe" is "act as to limit or undermine." That being said, without the 2nd amendment there would be no 1st amendment, because the 2nd amendment insures the entire Bill of Rights. Therefore, anyone exercizing their 1st amendment right advocating gun control is a hypocrite,﻿ PERIOD!

debating over gun control is stupid to me.﻿ it's dodging the real issue: what is causing people to commit violent acts in the first place? let's try to solve the issue at it's source, pull it by the roots.

We do not love guns. Nor do we fear one another. We respect our Constitution and feel an obligation to defend each article from an﻿ incompetent or tyrannical government. We have seen other democracies give way to dictatorships and we have learned from history's lessons. "If we restrict liberty to attain security we will lose them both." - Benjamin Franklin

Robert Levy, chairman of the Cato Institute and a former Georgetown University law﻿ professor, said: “Suppose the Second Amendment said ‘A well-educated electorate being necessary for self-governance in a﻿ free state, the right of the people to keep and read books shall not be infringed.’ Is there anyone﻿ who would suggest that means only registered voters have a right to read?”

he peoples' right to defend themselves is not limited to fighting back against criminals who wish to harm their property and families. As the Declaration of Independence states: “Whenever﻿ any﻿ form of government becomes destructive﻿ of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.”

It is ironic that some leaders say this amendment is outdated during a time when people in many countries are fighting for their lives and freedoms against corrupt and evil governments. Like our founders, they are often outgunned and outmanned. In﻿ some cases our government tries to aid their causes by supplying them with weapons. It is worth noting that the﻿ donated arms are﻿ not restricted to non-military style guns with magazines that hold fewer than 10 rounds

Founding Fathers would eagerly﻿ support the public’s right to own so-called﻿ assault weapons. In fact, based on their experiences, they might entrust the public with fully automatic weapons, cannons, grenades, night vision optics, armored vehicles, body﻿ armor, and anything else that could make the playing field more even.

Given the circumstances of the American Revolution, one can assume that the﻿ Founding Fathers intended to allow people to protect themselves from government﻿ tyranny — after all, that is the battle they fought and won. It is difficult to wage such a war if the government restricts people from having the best﻿ possible weaponry.

“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”
Those last﻿ four words are especially powerful, because﻿ by trying to restrict the types of arms people are allowed to own, infringing on our rights is exactly what lawmakers are currently attempting.

The 2nd amendment focus of the NRA occurred because before that time there was little in the way of gun control activities. The 2nd amendment at that time was defacto understood to protect a personal right to keep and bear arms. Open carry was legal almost everywhere -- concealed carry was very common but, in some jurisdictions required﻿ a permit. That is why the NRA made little mention of the 2nd amendment. The speaker is a useless propagandizing clown.

The reason why hardliners took over was because the NRA was actually working against gun owners for several decades. I dropped my membership years ago because the organization was more intent on using the laws to create a monopoly on certifications and establishing a system that forces gun owners to take their training courses. It became just another crony organization focused on﻿ capturing markets and making money.

The reason why the Federal Government cannot ban the personal sale of guns within a state is because they have no jurisdiction. FFL commercial dealers are bound by the laws because they are a business that sells products that requires an FFL. This is covered under the commerce clause...a personal sale between residents of the same state is not a commercial transaction and therefore does not fall within the jurisdiction of the﻿ Federal gov.

If that person sells a gun to an out﻿ of State resident then it would fall within the jurisdiction of the Fed -- since the intent would be to export the gun across state lines thus putting in Federal jurisdiction.

When I turned 16, I got a job and bought a car. I was﻿ still in high school and so had to work nights.One afternoon on my way out of the house my Grand Mother stopped me, and handed me her Colt Cobra.
Her instructions were clear and simple:
1. Tell nobody about the gun, ever, and that included my mother (her daughter).
2.﻿ Make damn sure I come home every night.

My Grand Mother started carrying concealed (illegally) in 1963 after her husband passed. Apparently, after reading my Grand Father's obituary, some trash decided that she was an easy target. She started receiving threatening phone calls late at night.﻿ Her home and car were burglarized. She was followed and even accosted on the street. After repeated conversations with the local constabulary, she was advised by them to get a gun and to keep it close.

One night she pulled into﻿ her driveway, got out of her car, and started walking with her purse and a bag of groceries toward the back door of her house. From behind, a man grabbed her by her hair. She dropped the bag of groceries and threw herself on the ground. The man never let go of her hair, and used it to pull her back onto her feet. She came up shooting. She shot him four times, and never lost a minute of sleep over it. Just one more unmarked grave in a county cemetery.

Her Great Grand Father was Jacob Walker, the last man to fall at the Battle of the Alamo.
According to Susanna Dickinson, one of a few that was spared during the massacre, Jacob Walker, the gunner from Nacogdoches after there were no more balls left to fire, plugged his cannon with scraps of cast iron and broken pieces of chain and fired at the Mexican﻿ soldiers.

Jacob, who had remained by his cannon until his wounds kept him from firing his cannon, leaped from the ramp, and dashed to the side of Mrs. Dickinson in one of the chapel side﻿ rooms. Within moments, the Mexican soldiers broke through the old doors. The bloody fighting was fierce, but brief.

Jacob was attempting to ignite the main powder magazine which would have blown the Alamo to pieces,﻿ but because of his injuries crawled to Mrs. Dickenson and begged her to take a message to his wife Anna, he then turned to face the Mexican hordes. Susanna Dickenson said the Mexican soldiers shot and bayoneted him to death as she looked on. The soldiers pitched him around on bayonets, as they would a bail of hay.

Jacob Walker's brother was Captain Joseph R. Walker,﻿ one of the greatest mountain men that ever lived. He forged the California Trail, the primary route for the emigrants to the gold fields during the California gold rush, and was likely the first white man to gaze upon Yosemite Valley.

A country armed with guns is the ONLY way to guarantee genocide like the﻿ houlocost will NEVER happen . The ONLY way . Gun made America , no guns will undo America. Mexico had no guns , but the cartels over run the helpless people .

Right...because the Nazi's steamrolled the polish, french, Austrian, etc. armies﻿ but Jews would have been safe in Germany with small arms...Please don't invoke the holocaust to prove your point. It just makes you sound like an idiot...

Oh no.. I don't think the Jews would have one the war with small arms, but﻿ they would have giving them a fight while the rest ESCAPED.. before the holocaust.
Or do you disagree with fighting back?

It wouldn't have made any difference. Look at what happened to the Polish and Czech Jews who were armed when Hitler invaded...They were killed or sent to concentration camps just like German Jews. And very few Jews ever imagined their country would turn on them and do such evil things or they certainly would have all left. My point﻿ is your argument that people can fight modern armies with small arms is ridiculous. Only military defection could possibly stop a hypothetical tyranical US government

Well i'm glad that you have made up your mind to bend over and take up the ass like a good servant.. as for me, I'm more then ready to fight to the death for my liberty, and the liberty of future generations.
A universal national gun registry may trigger a 2nd civil war/revolution. I don't think it will ever come﻿ to it though. But if it did...
The question is, what side will you fight on... and with what? O_o

If you had read the entire conversation instead of trolling for a one line response you would see that I addressed his argument in dozens of previous comments. Even in the first comment you responded to, I was making the point that people making holocaust references and talking about standing up to a hypothetical tyranical government just hurts all responsible gun owners case and makes us look like fringy nut jobs. You just saw the word conspiracist and thought you﻿ enter your stock response..

I read your replies before responding, all three. Hypothetical tyrannical government? Our government is a fully blown imperialist tyranny. Ever seen a night raid in﻿ Camden? It looks just like a raid in Fallujah, which is precisely the point. Just because jack-booted thugs aren't stomping on your neck doesn't mean they don't exert tyranny over us; it's just more subtle. Also, if most Jews had risen up, like those in the Warsaw Uprising, there would have been a dramatic difference.

Well done. Glad to see someone asking questions, rather than simply stating rhetoric. Two minor mistakes. The gun﻿ owner in WV, meant to say that a .243 is the minimum caliber for deer hunting. The AR15 uses a .223 which is actually a varmint cartridge. The other is about the BG checks at gun shows. Licensed Dealers are required to do BG checks at gun shows same as if they are in their stores. Privates sellers don't, whether or not they are at a gun show.

May I also bring up the point that in other, more violent and less intellectual nations (you know those that stone wizards﻿ or burn off women's clits or tell their men that if they sleep with a virgin they will cure their HIV, or force women to marry their rapists) They use the guns to just shoot each other dead in the street and allow the mob boss with the most guns to rule their people. Yeah, Americans with guns are the issue. WTF????

If only the Armenians had guns, maybe they'd have had a better chance. Unfortunately, the Pasha knew of their weakness or perhaps it was their phobia? Defenseless, the people were then evicted from their homes for nothing more than﻿ their differences.

What fuels Americans "love of guns"? LIBERTY!!!!!!!!!
The knowledge﻿ that our forefathers set us up to be able STAND UP TO AN ABUSIVE, CORRUPT AND TYRANNICAL GOVERNMENT.
Oh thats right, the rest of the world seems to be on their knees giving head to their religious / political leaders.. My bad.

The hiding raison of owning guns in the US is the fear of African-Americans and native Indians. They fear that is what all own guns !﻿

5:30 It's people like this that scare the hell out of me.. Oh? The government has Nuclear weapons and Fighter Jets also, does that mean you ought to be able also to own those 'products'...?? People just don't f*ing think.. They base all their decision making on emotions only.. It's terrifying to think of how the future will be with﻿ the kids being raised by these hateful narcissists..

Gotta love the hateful narcissist saying that people are hateful narcissists.
You're right though, people do base their decisions on emotions, and you're proof﻿ of it.

Of course citizens should be allowed the right to purchase nuclear weapons or fighter jets. The free market regulates it beyond anything a government could do. Would anyone buy an F-16 if it were legal? Of course not; it's not affordable, you need a pilot's license to legally operate it, access to an airstrip capable of handling it, etc. People like﻿ YOU just don't f*cking think. Legal consequences are the greatest deterrent to crime and violence, not the prohibition of any particular weapon.

Well the Iraqis and Afghans had mainly obsolete shoulder weapons and improvised mines and they faired pretty well against the moronic US military...so maybe they are not so delusional! I think the system will collapse ala USSR due to its own﻿ incompetence without violence, how about you?

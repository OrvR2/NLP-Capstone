Blog Posts by Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsHouse to observe moment of silence for NewtownBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Mon, Dec 17, 2012Tweet0
A woman pays respects at a memorial outside of St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church, Sunday, Dec. 16, 2012, in Newtown, Conn. (Julio Cortez/AP)The House of Representatives will pause late Monday for a moment of silence to honor the 20 children and six adults killed in the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced. The Senate held its moment of silence after returning to work at 2 p.m.
Cantor made the announcement on Twitter.
"Tonight, the House will observe a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and their families," he wrote.
The solemn tribute comes as lawmakers gird for what could be a new battle over gun control in the aftermath of the tragedy. Several Democrats have pushed for restrictions including curbs on the sale of large ammunition clips and for renewing the assault weapons ban that lapsed in 2004.
President Barack Obama has signaled support for some kind of official response without giving any details, and it's unclear whether any gun control measures can pass the U.S. Congress.

Obama, Boehner meet as ‘fiscal cliff’ loomsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Mon, Dec 17, 2012Tweet0
The U.S. Capitol Building. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)President Barack Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner met Monday for 45 minutes as part of efforts to forge a compromise averting the "fiscal cliff" of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts, which some fear would trigger a new recession, aides said.
"The president and the speaker are meeting at the White House to continue their discussions about the fiscal cliff and balanced deficit reduction," a White House official said on condition of anonymity. A Boehner aide confirmed the meeting.
The two leaders have traded offers and counteroffers without really ever reporting concrete progress towards a deal that is expected to pair tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans (an Obama demand) with deeper cuts in entitlement spending (a Republican goal).
Absent a breakthrough by Jan. 1, income taxes will rise across the board, the payroll tax holiday will end, some unemployment benefits will dry up, and the government will face deep cuts to domestic and military spending. Economists have warned that, taken together, these steps could push the weak economy into a new recession.

Obama in Newtown: ‘We can’t tolerate this anymore’By Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Sun, Dec 16, 2012Tweet0

President Barack Obama assured the grieving, shell-shocked Newtown community on Sunday that "you are not alone" and vowed sternly to wield "whatever power this office holds" in a quest to prevent future mass shootings.
"We can't tolerate this anymore," Obama said from behind a podium on the stage of a Newton High School auditorium, as adults wept, or hugged, or sat quietly, many hugging small children. "These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change."
"In the coming weeks, I'll use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens -- from law enforcement, to mental health professionals, to parents, and educators -- in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this, because what choice do we have?"he said.
The speech, broadcast nationwide, offered the bold suggestion that Obama might engage lawmakers on the subject of gun control -- a topic that has not been among his top priorities during his presidency.
"We can't accept events like this as routine. Are we really prepared to say that we're powerless in the face of such carnage?" Obama said.  That the politics are too hard? Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year, after year, after year is somehow the price of our freedom?"
There were sobs from the crowd as the president read the first names of the 20 children slaughtered at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday and paid tribute to the six adults who died defending them. Twenty-six candles in twenty-six shining glass vases shone from the base of the podium.

Obama anticipated — and dismissed — some of the time-honored arguments against stricter restrictions on guns. "We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex, and that is true," he said. "No single law no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society."
"But that can't be an excuse for inaction. Surely we can do better than this," he said.

Obama to travel to Newtown, Conn., on SundayBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Sat, Dec 15, 2012Tweet0
(Reuters/Larry Downing)
President Barack Obama will travel to Newtown, Conn., on Sunday to meet with families of those killed in the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School and thank emergency workers who responded to the tragedy, the White House said Saturday.
"The president will also speak at an interfaith vigil" at 7 p.m., press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement.
On Friday, an emotional Obama vowed to "take meaningful action, regardless of the politics," to prevent future tragedies like the shooting massacre, which killed 26 people at the school, 20 of them children.
"Our hearts are broken today," Obama said in a brief statement at the White House briefing room, frequently pausing to wipe tears from his eyes. "The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old. They had their entire lives ahead of them: birthdays, graduations, weddings, kids of their own. Among the fallen were also teachers, men and women who devoted their lives

Gun control petition clears White House response thresholdBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Dec 14, 2012Tweet0
President Barack Obama wipes his eye as he speaks about the elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn (Charles Dharapak/AP)A petition calling on President Barack Obama to push for new gun control laws in the aftermath of the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., has cleared the 25,000-signature threshold required to obtain a formal White House response.
The measure, filed in response to Friday's massacre, urges Obama to "immediately address the issue of gun control through the introduction of legislation in Congress."
"The goal of this petition is to force the Obama Administration to produce legislation that limits access to guns," it says. "While a national dialogue is critical, laws are the only means in which we can reduce the number of people murdered in gun related deaths."
Obama vowed on Friday to "take meaningful action, regardless of the politics," to prevent future tragedies like the shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Gun control group scolds White House over Newtown responseBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Dec 14, 2012Tweet0
Under the eye-catching banner, "48,000 Americans will be murdered with guns during President Obama's Term," a group that advocates tighter restrictions on firearms sharply criticized the White House for its reaction to the massacre at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school.
Demand A Plan rebuked President Barack Obama's press secretary Jay Carney on Friday for saying that "today's not the day" to push for gun control.

"We couldn't disagree more," the group wrote on its website. "We say, Now IS the Time to talk about guns. Now IS the time to prevent more pointless deaths. Now IS the time to Demand A Plan to End Gun Violence."
Founded after the July 2012 shooting rampage in Aurora, Colo., the organization is composed of survivors of recent mass shootings, relatives of victims, and Mayors Against Illegal Guns. That group, in turn, was co-founded in 2006 by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino.
"The school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, is a tragedy beyond comprehension," Demand A Plan wrote. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their loved ones and the community that has been hit with this senseless act of violence.

Emotional Obama vows action to prevent shootings ‘regardless of the politics’By Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Dec 14, 2012Tweet0

Obama expressed sorrow for the victims' loved ones and sympathy for the parents of the children who survived but who know that "their children's innocence has been torn away from them too early."
"As a country we have been through this too many times," Obama said, listing a series of mass shootings over the past few years in places like Aurora, Colo.
"These neighborhoods are our neighborhoods, and these children are our  children. And we're going to have to come together and take meaningful  action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics,"  he stressed.

Earlier, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters that "today's not the day" to talk about possible new gun control steps meant to prevent such tragedies in the future.

Obama spokesman: ‘Today’s not the day’ for gun control talkBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Dec 14, 2012Tweet0

A White House spokesman said Friday that the shooting rampage at a Connecticut school saddened President Barack Obama as a father, but that "today's not the day" for a discussion about possible gun control measures to be taken in response to the massacre.
"Today's not ... a day to engage in the usual Washington policy debates," press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. "That day will come, but today's not that day."
Carney's admonition came as news organizations reported that as many as 27 people, including 18 children, were killed at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.
"As a father, incidents like these weigh heavily on him—and, I think, on everyone who has children," Carney said, highlighting "the enormous suffering" of parents of those killed.
Obama got word of the tragedy at 10:30 a.m. from Homeland Security adviser John Brennan. He later discussed the situation with FBI Director Robert Mueller and Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy and shared his "condolences and concern," Carney said.

Obama, Boehner have ‘frank’ talks as ‘fiscal cliff’ loomsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Dec 13, 2012Tweet0
President Barack Obama walking back to the White House after attending a Christmas party at the Blair House hosted by the National Security Council (Jason Reed/Reuters)With talks on avoiding the "fiscal cliff" locked in a pattern of public battling and private negotiating, President Barack Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner met behind closed doors for 50 minutes at the White House on Thursday.
Both sides agreed the discussion in the Oval Office was "frank" and insisted that the "lines of communication remain open." (In diplomat-speak, a "frank" discussion typically means "an argument.") Neither side reported any progress.
The meeting was their first since Sunday, though they had spoken on the telephone since then. The talks came amid public pessimism in Congress that Obama and Boehner can work out a deal to avoid the painful across-the-board income tax hikes and deep government spending cuts that, together, could plunge the weak economy into a new recession.
Before the negotiations, Obama did a round of local and regional television interviews, part of an aggressive public relations campaign to keep the American public on his side. He sat down with stations from Philadelphia, Miami, Minneapolis and Sacramento, Calif.
"I remain hopeful that we can get this resolved. It shouldn't be hard to get resolved," the president told WCCO in Minneapolis.

‘Build a Death Star’ petition clears threshold for Obama responseBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Dec 13, 2012Tweet0
Disney CEO Robert Iger, left, and It is a period of civil war. Rebel pranksters, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the forces of Taking White House Petitions Too Seriously. Specifically: They have secured the 25,000 signatures necessary to get a formal response from the White House to their call for America to build a DEATH STAR.
"Those who sign here petition the United States government to secure funding and resources, and begin construction on a Death Star by 2016," the petition reads.
"By focusing our defense resources into a space-superiority platform and weapon system such as a Death Star, the government can spur job creation in the fields of construction, engineering, space exploration, and more, and strengthen our national defense."
Some estimates put the cost of doing so at around $852 quadrillion, roughly 13,000 times the gross domestic product of the entire Earth—even when factoring in the savings of not putting any guardrails around any of the facility's seemingly endless number of bridges, spans, shafts and pits. And history cautions against being too proud of the technological terror thus constructed, because the ability to destroy a planet, or even a whole system, is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

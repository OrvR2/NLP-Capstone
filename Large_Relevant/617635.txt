Critics Sour Over President Obama’s ‘Spilled Milk’ Joke At The SOTU

While President Obama‘s State of the Union speech received a predictably mixed response divided among partisan lines, most people tended to agree the most cringe-inducing moment of the night came during a milk joke that went over like a lead balloon. “I’ve ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don’t make sense…We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill – because milk was somehow classified as an oil. With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.” Obama’s crack drew some nervous laughter.

After grinning uncomfortably, Obama quickly added, “I’m confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder.”
Reaction in the Twitterverse was quick and harsh, here were a sample:
“Obama should fire whoever gave him the “spilled milk” joke. LOL Even the First Lady wasn’t impressed!” – TJ Holmes
“I will find you, guy who wrote that spilled milk joke. I will find you.” – @allisonkilkenny
“Spilled milk”? IMPEACH!” — Jonah Goldberg
“Wow that joke is like one my dad would have made. #sotu #notacompliment” — Aaron Blake
“OH NO YOU DIDN’T” — Andy Levy

I sometimes wonder if it’s just me that see’s Obama on a completely different level than those two. It’s almost like Mitt and Newt are television commenters sparring for a hosting gig.. whereas Obama just seems like a president and doesn’t have to pretend.

I DVR’d the speech to watch tomorrow, so I may have missed it, but I wonder if he mentioned the EPA rule fining oil companies many thousands of dollars for not using a fuel that hasn’t been invented yet.

I spilled milk once, and it took a week before the dairy sent pontoons. The milking machine’s blowout preventer failed. It was an udder mess.

America’s big amateur hour was in 2008, when fools voted for someone with no Record, no Accomplishments, no Past, nothing!  And look what it got us!  A fool that loves to act N*gger Rich on taxpayer money, luxurious vacations, luxurious parties, rubbing elbows with the Hollywood scum, and someone who has been more interested in his 2012 reelection than getting America back on track!  Obama is a very Pathetic, Arrogant, Narcisist person that loves to have a Rock Star status but doesn’t want to do anything to earn it, only read stupid, horrible jokes from a Dummy Board!

He seemed to forget to mention that it took Obama two months, after the oil spill, to start doing anthing about it!  That was really pathetic!  Oh well, what do you expect from someone who has no Records, no Accomplishments, no Past, nothing but a smooth way of reading a Dummy Board!  Pathetic!  Only Fools and the Mentally Challenged will vote for this Idiot, Obama, in November!  I am a lifetime Democrat, but I refused to vote for an unknown in 2008 and now I refuse to vote for such a horrible nonleader as Obama, in November.  ABO!  Anyone But Obama!

I’m surprised more in this crowd don’t get the joke underlying the joke. It’s just like the speaker saying to the audience, At this point, my speechwriter recommended I insert a joke, as in ‘Insert Joke Here’ – so here it is, folks, yuk it up.
Among comedians & other public speakers it’s called “a groaner”. It’s use ebbs & flows, but it’s got a history that’s as old as theater. When I was a kid, it was a regular feature of the stand-up act of the then-pretty-much-acknowledged (also self-promoted) “King of TV Comedy”, Milton Berle, who’s act reflected its roots in vaudeville.  
The underlying idea is self-mocking: Uncle Milty would be up there basking in the laughs & applause & egging it on, in very much the manner of how Stephen Colbert does at the beginning of the opening bit on his show – for the very same reason – and in the midst of a run of fast-delivered good bits, he’d do a big build-up for a deliberate groaner, and then react with fake shock as the joke got boo’d as sub-standard. The punchline is where the speaker shares with the audience that, Okay folks, I already knew in advance this joke is a groaner, but I’m the speaker & you’re the audience so we’re both doing this together. It says, This is an act, this is a show, & we’re all together in this, as Shakespeare said, All the world’s a stage & all we mortals on it mere players on that stage, also the subject of the closing fugue in Verdi’s amazingly fast comic opera Falstaff. In psychological terms, it creates a bond by promoting a form of shared release.
FDR used to do this in just about every speech. Truman did it, too, but it was less obvious because he was less smooth in delivery. JFK did it, too, not as much. Carter did it, but he’d spoil the effect by grinning in advance, giving it away in the set-up. Reagan was the absolute master at it, which is where I most strongly suspect Obama took it from. Bush the elder had a go at it from time to time, but not so good – but Clinton didn’t at all. Bush the younger tried it but the set-up didn’t work because the speaker-audience shared consciousness was that the he really WAS a poor public speaker. Mitt Romney actually OVER-uses it, but Newt Gingrich has a really nice feel for it & good timing. 
Again: it works best when the underlying assumption or ‘common myth’ between speaker & audience is that the speaker is a master at his craft & is effectively going down into the audience & ‘sharing’ with them that the joke is sub-standard. I don’t think Obama’s delivery was perfect – I think he telegraphed it a bit too much – but it was okay. And note that we’re talking about it, as are all the 40 million plus who watched & heard it, & that’s the POINT. 






Hout Bosques



Right here is the sought-for effect. This is precisely what Reagan was after when he told these sorts of ‘country homely’ jokes. 






Hout Bosques



It’s going to get known to history as the “Fairness Speech”. I think it was maybe a bit diffuse in self-identification, a bit too detailed & Clinton-esque, because he also had that repeated “Built To Last” (Made in America) theme, but even then I’m quite sure that was a deliberate choice to add in an appeal to worker pride to the main theme of empathy for the victims of the Bush recession.

 There’s nothing racist about the words redneck, mouth-breather, troglodyte- heck I’ve called Herman Cain those very words.    Quite applicable to many skin colors and cultures.  But the 19th and 20th century applications for the N word are pretty hard to deny as anything but racist.

“Vetted” that’s a rich term when referring to this administration.

Of all the things Obama said one important line stoodout.  Obama said ”as long as he is president we will not go back to the failed polices of the previous administration”. The consistent message I have heard from Newt and Mitt is they will take us right back to the policies of the Bush administration. So you be thre judge.  The bountries are set for 2012.  Do you want to fall back to the failled Bush polices and allow the activities to go on that got us in us in this mess in the first place or do you want to continue on and ride the current momentum. Fairly simple answer to me.

Ya.. I especially like the statement “With or without this Congress”.  Hm sounds a little Marxist to me.  Sounds like he used the Constitution as toilet paper before he started the campaign speech. 
If that statement was made by a Conservative you Dems would be outraged.  
I mean I just imagine Obama”s frame of thought…. If Congress would just rubber stamp everything I want everything would be ok. I’m the smartest person in the world.
How can anyone not agree with me. I’m just like any wife..I’m always right but default. 
Bush 8 years in office 5 trillion added to debt.  (That’s bad..no fan of Bush)
Obama 3 years in Office over 6 trillion added to debt. At this rate if he gets another term during his terms more debt will be added than all other President’s administrations put together even if we raise taxes on the rich get out of both wars. 
Socialist always run out of money sooner or later. Look at Europe! 
China has found the answer to successful Communism.. Enslave their people to cheaply produce the goods we all love to use. Ask Apple and other tech companies. 
Funny how Obama was lauding Apple and Steve Jobs one of the biggest outsourcers
out there and then later criticizing companies that outsource. 
Don’t know the origin of this but it’s hard to dispute:
* You can not legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity. 
* What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving. 
* The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from someone else. 
* You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it. 
* When half of the people get the idea the that they do not need to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does not good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the being of the end. 
Personally I would not care if the uber rich were taxed more either by stopping loop-holes, or not receiving SS or Medicare above a given level or maybe even raising rates…but for every penny of revenue gained they most be real cuts. Not cuts in the future increase already planned as they usually do but real cuts. But every ime Conservative have made that deal or something like it never happens.

As the cast of the Republican freak show has learned to its dismay, an excess of vetting is not necessarily a good thing. Now everyone knows how unfit their frontrunners are.
In Obama’s case, while he was a relatively new face, additional vetting would not have turned up anything of substance (remember that phrase, “of substance”), as the last three years have proved.

The only part that are not my words are marked by the ‘*’. Which is prefaced with “Don’t know the origin of this but it hard it dispute”. Which means I wasn’t trying take credit for it’s origin. And the opening sentence with Obama’s quote. 
But here are 2 points..
 
1) I didn’t cut and paste it. Because I don’t have a electronic copy of those statements in my PC. (the ones marked with the “*”. )
2) You didn’t even try to dispute those statements or the facts about our debt under Obama. 
I wonder why? A superficial claim I cut and paste is nothing? Why not try to argue the points? Because there is no argument. Facts in this case speak for themselves. The figures can be found all over the internet.

Bush did prove that anyone could become President, you are right.  Because the same feat was followed up by Obama. Only this time it even worse. You could probably pick a name a random from the phone book and get a better President.  Bush was at least humble. Obama is arrogant. The sad thing is what does this say about the state of the politics in this country. It’s a sad note.

A platitude is a trite, meaningless, biased, or prosaic statement, often presented as if it were significant and original. The word derives from plat, the French word for “flat.” Whether any given statement is considered to have meaning is highly subjective, so platitude is often—but not always—used as a pejorative term to describe seemingly profound statements that a certain person views as unoriginal or shallow. Examples of statements which could be considered platitudes could be “Go with the flow”, “Everything happens for a reason”, “If it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be”, and “We need to do what we can do”, ” Hope and change.”

I have never been impressed by Obama’s so-called “intellect” or his smooth way of reading a Dummy Board.  I have more respect for a person who can read their own notes, but, Obama may not write very well, which is understandable, since he was given a free pass his whole life, in the public sector and in school, never having to prove anything.  Now, as President, he still thinks he can slide by with a smile and a stupid joke.  The man is a total failure, all his policies, his decisions, everything, have Failed!  It will be a great day for America and the day we start to recover, when we rid our government of this Fool, Obama, and his Legion of Demon Administration!

Funny, I’m not especially worried about Paul making it to the White House. Why would that be?
Oh, I remember: he’s nuts!
(To be fair, he does have a few good ideas, but they’re so wrapped up in nuttiness it hardly matters.)

And that teacher isn’t a *real job.*

Did you ever run across late-night ads for a thing called a “salad shooter?”
It was a useless kitchen gadget that was supposed to be really effective at spraying your kitched with half-chopped vegetables. No home was supposed to be without one.
They’ve now created one that does the same thing for speech. Sarah Palin is a major stockholder, of course.
And many Mediaite posters have obviously acted RIGHT NOW and gotten two of the damn things.

I think the joke was hysterical (sarcasm). It demonstrates that our President has a great sense of humor (sarcasm)!   It was almost as funny as the one he told on Jay Leno when he said his bowling scores in the White House Bowling Alley might gualify him for a spot on the “Special Olympics” bowling team.  He was forced to apologize for that one!

And republicans want to take away your social security.
And republicans want dirty air.
And republicans want dirty water, to take away a woman’s right to choose, to take us back to Jim Crow.
At least all of your statements…:
And the world is ending due to Obama.
And Grandma is going to go before a death panel.
And Obama is the food stamp president (bush had more)
And Obama lost all the jobs.
…are factual.

If you are drinking milk from cows given the growth hormone you are drinking milk with pus in it.  The hormone gives the cows mastitis causing them to produce more milk in an effort to flush out the infection.  Infection = pus.  Years ago a farmer could not sell milk from cows with mastitis, now they can.  Barf.

Thanks for sharing.
Or not. This is kind of a sausage thing. You really don’t want to know too much about the process.

Cashews, Pistachios, or Sunflower seeds?

The President was being disingenuous about this this concession to the powerful dairy lobby. We are not talking about farms where a farmer gets up in the morning to milk a few cows to sell at the local market… We are talking about vast factory farms processing millions of gallons of milk, a highly profitable and highly subsidized industry ($10,000 a year is nothing) who was being asked to be safer about their handling of a product which is a toxic substance (yes milk and milk products kill humans after they over consume it- but that’s not what I’m talking about) If millions of gallons of milk products were suddenly dumped into a river or onto soil, it would have similar devastating effects as an oil spill, or any other toxic substance. Milk contains antibiotics, hormones, and microorganisms that would completely disrupt ecosystems, pollute groundwater and topsoil, and become a blight on the landscape. Factory farms are already exempt (via lobbying) from the most basic of environmental and ethical regulations and are highly profitable as a result. Already some US waterways have become vast pools and rivers of blood and animal feces, choking all the life out of them. The bad joke is that animal products kill at both ends, Americans are suffering from food related illness at epidemic rates, a boon for Mr. Obama’s two other favorite friends- the health insurance industry and the drug companies. Meat and Dairy consumption feeds big pharma and big insurance and American Health and the Environment loses.

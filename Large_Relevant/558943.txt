SANTA MARIA, Brazil (AP) — The bodies of the young college students were found piled up just inside the entrance of the Kiss nightclub, among more than 230 people who died in a cloud of toxic smoke after a blaze enveloped the crowded locale within seconds and set off a panic.
Hours later, the horrific chaos had transformed into a scene of tragic order, with row upon row of polished caskets of the dead lined up in the community gymnasium in the university city of Santa Maria.  Many of the victims were under 20 years old, including some minors.
As the city in southern Brazil prepared to bury the 233 people killed in the conflagration caused by a band's pyrotechnic display, an early investigation into the tragedy revealed that security guards briefly prevented partygoers from leaving through the sole exit. And the bodies later heaped inside that doorway slowed firefighters trying to get in.
"It was terrible inside — it was like one of those films of the Holocaust, bodies piled atop one another," said police inspector Sandro Meinerz. "We had to use trucks to remove them. It took about six hours to take the bodies away."
Survivors and another police inspector, Marcelo Arigony, said security guards briefly tried to block people from exiting the club. Brazilian bars routinely make patrons pay their entire tab at the end of the night before they are allowed to leave.
"It was chaotic and it doesn't seem to have been done in bad faith because several security guards also died," he told The Associated Press.
Later, firefighters responding to the blaze initially had trouble entering the club because "there was a barrier of bodies blocking the entrance," Guido Pedroso Melo, commander of the city's fire department, told the O Globo newspaper.
Police inspectors said they think the source of the blaze was a band's small pyrotechnics show. The fire broke out sometime before 3 a.m. Sunday and the fast-moving fire and toxic smoke created by burning foam sound insulation material on the ceiling engulfed the club within seconds.
Authorities said band members who were on the stage when the fire broke out later talked with police and confirmed they used pyrotechnics during their show.
Meinerz, who coordinated the investigation at the nightclub, said one band member died after escaping because he returned inside the burning building to save his accordion. The other band members escaped alive because they were the first to notice the fire.
The fire spread so fast inside the packed club that firefighters and ambulances could do little to stop it, survivor Luana Santos Silva told the Globo TV network.
"There was so much smoke and fire, it was complete panic, and it took a long time for people to get out, there were so many dead," she said.
Most victims died from smoke inhalation rather than burns. Many of the dead, about equally split between young men and women, were also found in the club's two bathrooms, where they fled apparently because the blinding smoke caused them to believe the doors were exits.
There were questions about the club's operating license. Police said it was in the process of being renewed, but it was not clear if it was illegal for the business to be open. A single entrance area about the size of five door spaces was used both as an entrance and an exit.
Family members of those killed walked around the gym in a daze Sunday evening, shuffling between caskets or holding one another and weeping as they identified loved ones and tried to make sense of what had happened.
Elaine Marques Goncalves lost her son Deivis in the fire. Another son who attended the college party at the nightclub, Gustavo, was barely alive after suffering two cardiac arrests caused by smoke inhalation.
She learned of the blaze after the mother of her sons' friends called her early Sunday.
"My boys were not home and I had no news. I turned on the TV — the tragedy was all over the television," she said at the makeshift morgue. "All I knew was they had gone to a club, I didn't know which one. I kept saying: 'Where do I start? Where do I go?'"
Television images from the city of about 260,000 people showed black smoke billowing out of the nightclub as shirtless young men who attended a university party there joined firefighters using axes and sledgehammers to pound at the hot-pink exterior walls, trying to reach those trapped inside.
Bodies of the dead and injured were strewn in the street and panicked screams filled the air as medics tried to help. There was little to be done; officials said most of those who died were suffocated by smoke within minutes.
Within hours the community gym was a horror scene, with body after body lined up on the floor, partially covered with black plastic as family members identified kin.
Outside the gym police held up personal objects — a black purse, a blue high-heeled shoe — as people seeking information on loved ones crowded around, hoping not to recognize anything being shown them.
The gathering was a party organized by students from several academic departments from the Federal University of Santa Maria. Such organized university parties are common throughout Brazil.
Survivor Michele Pereira told the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper that she was near the stage when members of the band lit some sort of flare.
"The band that was onstage began to use flares and, suddenly, they stopped the show and pointed them upward," she said. "At that point, the ceiling caught fire. It was really weak, but in a matter of seconds it spread."
Guitarist Rodrigo Martins told Radio Gaucha that the band, Gurizada Fandangueira, started playing at 2:15 a.m. "and we had played around five songs when I looked up and noticed the roof was burning."
"It might have happened because of the Sputnik, the machine we use to create a luminous effect with sparks. It's harmless, we never had any trouble with it," he said. "When the fire started, a guard passed us a fire extinguisher, the singer tried to use it but it wasn't working."
He confirmed that accordion player Danilo Jacques, 28, died, while the five other members made it out safely.
Police Maj. Cleberson Braida Bastianello said by telephone that the toll had risen to 233 with the death of a hospitalized victim. He said earlier that the death toll was likely made worse because the nightclub appeared to have just one exit through which patrons could exit.
Federal Health Minister Alexandre Padhilha told a news conference that most of the 117 people treated in hospitals had been poisoned by gases they breathed during the fire. Only a few suffered serious burns, he said.
Most of the dead apparently were asphyxiated, according to Dr. Paulo Afonso Beltrame, a professor at the medical school of the Federal University of Santa Maria who went to the city's Caridade Hospital to help victims.
"Large amounts of toxic smoke quickly filled the room, and I would say that at least 90 percent of the victims died of asphyxiation," Beltrame told the AP.
Sunday's fire appeared to be the worst at a nightclub since December 2000, when a welding accident reportedly set off a fire at a club in Luoyang, China, killing 309.
Similar circumstances led to a 2003 nightclub fire that killed 100 people in the United States. Pyrotechnics used as a stage prop by the 1980s rock band Great White set ablaze cheap soundproofing foam on the walls and ceiling of a Rhode Island music venue.

Awful.
  But we keep setting up these perfect scenarios for disaster. There are no good reasons, no excuses. And there is no way to bring these kids back now.
  Think. Be responsible. But no, we'd rather make money. This same scenario has been played out over and over again, and no one ever learns a damned thing.

Years ago fires in homes and business rarely generated toxic smoke or spread very fast. That was because natural materials were used; leather, natural fiber cloth and wood. Today that's not the case; almost everything we have in our homes and businesses is made of synthetic materials. These materials are often highly flammable and very toxic when burned. Think about your carpeting and furniture as examples.
Home fires used to kill people because they got trapped inside, and these people burned to death. Dying from lack of oxygen or being poisoned just wasn't a big concern.
Using sprinkler systems worked great because insulation was typically fiber glass and ceilings weren't flammable. Insulation trapped people sometimes because it was common to use things like old newspapers for insulation between the walls with an asphalt impregnated material to stop air leakage with its attendant heat loss. If fire ever got inside the walls a sprinkler system wasn't effective.
Today some things must be done differently. It's not possible to make nontoxic, slow burning modern materials cost effectively. We need a really fast way to vent the fire, even knowing that this will cause the fire to grow faster. If we don't vent the fire, the level of smoke with its toxic fumes very quickly kills people. We’re talking about only having 1 or 2 minutes in many cases. Sprinklers simply aren't fast enough and can't do anything useful if they don't spray places they aren't aimed at. The other issue with sprinkler systems is that they must have an absolutely reliable source of water at high pressure, and that's not reasonably or cost effectively possible in huge areas of the world.
So far I think we’re all pretty much on the same page… and where I’m going to propose a new solution that is very counter intuitive. What we may need to do is to vent the fire, just like firefighters must do before they can enter a burning building. Yup, use toxic gas sensors and temperature sensors that detect a rapid rise in temperature or infrared levels as well as air born toxins and these detectors need to blow open carefully located vents, hatches, in the roof and near floor level.
This kind of a system must be battery powered, constantly performing ‘self checks’ and designed with NASA quality reliability. Once a fire has been detected the electronics must blow the hatches open as fast as possible, even if that means using things like explosive bolts to release spring loaded vents.
Here’s what this kind of a system must do. First it must suck the interior air towards the roof vents and that will in turn draw the fire in that direction as well where there shouldn’t be much material that can burn. Other, floor level vents must activate just as fast so the level of toxins in the air is rapidly reduced by normal outside air and oxygen. Fresh air will feed the fire, and that’s not good, but it will at the same time make the interior of the building survivable until firefighters can arrive and begin to assist the people inside.
A system like this can be at least as cheap as a sprinkler system and directly addresses the cause of death in modern buildings. The other important thing to repeat is that this system isn’t critically dependent on any outside infrastructure. Even places in the world where electric power is unreliable would be able to keep the system’s batteries powered since these systems don’t use much power to begin with.
The vast majority of the existing apartment complexes and public accommodations could quickly, cheaply and unobtrusively implement a system like this today. Firefighters first question, on their way to a fire should be, “Have the vents opened?” not “Where can we get water after we’ve vented the building.” When firefighters have to vent a building before they can begin to fight the fire and assist the victims, it is already too late to be very effective. Let’s talk seriously about this kind of solution, ok?

Sounds exactly like the, "Whitesnake" fire in Rhode Island a few years ago. Indoor pyrotechnics, blocked exits, no ventilation , overcrowded, etc. etc. Very sad!

When you enter a building know where the exits are.

Greed and Money. Can't leave without paying your tab.  Simple, pay as you go, nobody has a tab all doors unlocked and open all the time.

Time for Brazil to wake up....pass safety laws, enforce safety laws....correctly license these kinds of places.....100% preventable.....100% stupidity.....230 young people paid the ultimate price. The ownwers / operators of this club need to be prosecuted for murder and locked up for life! Brazil is going to host the Olympics in 4 years time...they will be complying with all the health / safety / fire saftey regs on all facilities they build to be in line with  US / European safety standards.

Haven't band members and club managers learned anything about those flares or fireworks?  Now so many lives have been lost senselessly.  My prayers are with all of the victims, survivors and families.  This is really sad.

As for the men in the photo: God Bless them both.  How lucky is the injured man to have his friend carry him out of harms way; and how lucky is the friend to find the strength to carry the injured man out of harms way?

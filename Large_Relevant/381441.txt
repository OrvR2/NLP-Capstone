U.S. mental health experts urge focus on childhood screeningBy David Morgan | Reuters – Fri, Jan 25, 2013

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. mental health system has huge gaps that prevent many children with psychological problems from receiving effective treatment that could prevent tragic consequences later in life, experts told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday.
              Just over a month after the shooting rampage in Newtown, Connecticut, mental health experts said psychological disorders usually emerge before people enter high school but that only one-quarter of children with problems see trained professionals and often the care is not enough.
              "We see the results of insufficient mental healthcare in school failure and suicide. How do we do better?" Michael Hogan, head of the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, said in written testimony to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
              "While the gaps in children's mental healthcare are huge, there is also reason for hope," he added. "In part, this is because we know more about what works, and what doesn't."
              Hogan, a former New York mental health commissioner, was scheduled to appear with two other experts Thursday at the Senate committee's first hearing on mental health issues since the presidency of Republican George W. Bush, who set up the commission Hogan now chairs.
              The hearing was scheduled in response to the shootings at Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School where Adam Lanza, a young man described as having mental issues, gunned down 26 people including 20 young children with an AR-15-type assault rifle on December 14.
              The tragedy and other mass shootings in recent years have ignited a debate about gun control and mental health, including a push by President Barack Obama for stronger gun controls and better mental health training for schools and communities.
              Robert Vero, chief executive of a network of Tennessee clinics called Centerstone, said mental health professionals who work with children also lack access to parents and other relatives whose problems may contribute to a child's troubles, sometimes due to inadequate insurance coverage.
              "We need to be able to teach parenting skills if we want the child's behavior to change," said Vero. "We need to be able to address the parent's depression or addiction."
              The experts credited Obama's healthcare reform law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, with making a step forward by requiring insurers including Medicaid to provide coverage for mental health issues.
              But they said the American social safety net still fails to provide adequate access for the poor and elderly, noting that state mental health funding declined $4 billion from 2009 to 2012 as a result of budget constraints posed by recession and the weak economic recovery.
              (This story was corrected to fix clinic network's name to Centerstone from Cornerstone in paragraph 8)

Hopefully this does not degenerate into a bonaza for the pharmacutical industry, but atleast its a start.

We've already got enough parents and teachers deceitfully lying about children being mentally challenged because they refuse to parent and care for normal children properly. Adults today want children to be miniature adults rather than kids. The mental illness is in the adults who are antisocial dysfunctionals blaming kids for being kids.  This is a horrible step... it's a farce.

What some kids say
"They are dreamers. That doesn't mean they are wrong. They just don't fit the norm, so they are labeled and damned, labeled as ADD. So the doctors dope us up with Ritalin and control our minds with low doses of speed. The teachers pay us no mind unless are minds are under control. It screws up our chain of thought and makes us one-dimensional...It takes away that extra imagination and the flow of the mind, hence destroying the true, purest ideas of mind...I look forward to the day when Ritalin isn't an answer, and every student is labeled 'learner.'"

Source: Matt Sherbal, age 14 writing in his school newspaper. 

"I don't want to play"
"It makes me sad"
"I wouldn't smile or anything"
"It numbed me out"
"It takes over of me. It takes control"
"I feel 'wild' after it wears off."

The money is there, its just wasted on the consequences of doing nothing.This is a problem of free roving lunatics and CLOSED State Mental Hospitals. Reposting this for those wondering where the money would come from: The untreated/unstable INSANE are ALREADY a PUBLIC EXPENSE!!! Every time the police have to respond to them, every time they end up in court- taxpayer money! It costs $40,000+ for every year they are in prison for a crime that would not have occurred if they had been institutionalized as they would have been in the PAST! Most of the INSANE that belong in treatment are already on SSI/foodstamps, ect. Then of course there are the costs in strictly $$$ terms of the crimes they commit. Sandyhook has had to abandon an entire school because of the actions of someone who in the PAST would have been institutionalized in a State Mental Institution. How many millions of dollars all told will this one event cost versus in-patient treatment in a State Mental Hospital? The dollar costs of having CLOSED the State Mental Hospitals are hidden in our courts, emergency room costs, prison incarceration bills, insurance premiums and payouts- the money is being indirectly taxed all across society. Financially its probably CHEAPER to reopen the State Mental Hospitals, in terms of the quality of life and safety of society its essential.

We didn't have near these issues until that paradime of nothing ADD/ADHD started being treated. You know the doctor who invented that domain of diseases now says it was all done to facilitate the pharmaceutical firms in selling more drugs. Psych evals for fun and profit is what that is.

This is science?
"When I first began evaluating...for ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), I wanted to find out how other doctors dealt with this new group of patients, so I consulted with a fellow ADD specialist nearby. It was no big deal to him: "Just count the symptoms," he told me, "and if they meet the criteria, you can treat them" (with medication, it was implied. The subtleties and contradictions of behavior and emotions, the interactions of relationship and environment - none of this seemed important to him. It made me wonder why a doctor was needed, if this was all an evaluation required."

Lawrence H. Diller, M.D. from "Running on Ritalin" 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ritalin (and Adderall) logic: An imaginary conversation
1. What do psychoactive drugs do?
A: They change brain chemistry. 
2. Why do you want to change the brain chemistry of small children?
A: Their brain chemistry is flawed. 

3. What biologically based test do you use to determine that this is so?
A: We do not use such tests. 

4. Why not?
A: There are no valid tests available. 

5. How then do you diagnose and prescribe?
A: We use behavioral tests. 

6. Are you saying that merely by observing a child's behavior you can tell exactly what problems he has with his or her brain chemistry and then prescribe the correct substance in the precise dose needed to correct it?
A: That's the theory. 

7. Why do you suggest to some parents that they give their children a vacation from these drugs on the weekends and on holidays, including summer vacation?
A: These children have their biggest problems in the school environment. 

8. Are you suggesting that the brain chemistry of these children is different on the weekend than it is Monday through Friday?
A: The problems are often more acute in the school environment. 

9. Why do you think it is that countries with better health care systems and longer life spans than ours (Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland, for example) prescribe almost no Ritalin or Adderall for their children and that the US and Canada consume over 85% of the world's supply of these drugs? 
A: They are not as advanced as we are in the diagnosis and treatment of ADD and ADHD as we are. 

10. Since you have no biologically based test for the drugs you are prescribing and there is no scientifically valid evidence that proves these drugs are effective or even safe, how can you claim that your science on this subject is superior?
A: I'm an expert. How dare you question me? You are obviously anti-child and anti-progress. This interview is over.

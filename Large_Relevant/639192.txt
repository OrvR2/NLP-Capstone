Let's stipulate that people, and particularly politicians, can get into trouble by attempting to speak for God. But that's not the moral of the story regarding Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock. 
Responding to a question about abortion, Mourdock offered a grieved response — his voice breaking a bit — on the matter of which exceptions he favored. His Democratic opponent, Joe Donnelly, also pro-life, said that he would permit abortions in cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. Mourdock said he had "struggled with it . . . for a long time," but had come to the conclusion that "life is a gift from God." Unfortunately, he didn't stop there. He added that "even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen."
That was sufficient for the Democrats and their eager Dobermans in the press to salivate and pounce. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, head of the Democratic National Committee, fulminated, "Richard Mourdock's rape comments are outrageous and demeaning to women. Unfortunately, they've become part and parcel of the modern Republican Party's platform toward women's health as Congressional Republicans like Paul Ryan have worked to outlaw all abortions and even narrow the definition of rape."
The Associated Press headline said "God at Work When Rape Leads to Pregnancy" and the Atlantic screamed "Republican Senate Candidate Says Rape Pregnancies Are a 'Gift from God.'" There was much more along those lines.
Mourdock clarified a day later, saying "God creates life, and that was my point.  God does not want rape, and by no means was I suggesting that he does. Rape is a horrible thing, and for anyone to twist my words otherwise is absurd and sick."
But absurd is what the Democrats do. The Democratic Party is in the caricature business. Just consider Barack Obama's stock description of Mitt Romney: "He's running around the country saying he has a five-point plan. But he really has a one-point plan: Folks at the top get to play by a different set of rules than you do. They get to pay lower taxes than you do and use offshore accounts. Or they can invest in a company, bankrupt it, fire the workers, take away their pensions, ship the jobs overseas and still make money doing it."
It's getting hard to tell who's the lower demagogue — Mr. Obama or Ms. Wasserman Schultz. 
Mr. Mourdock chose his words poorly while attempting something dangerous — to grapple with a serious moral question in a political debate. People wonder why politicians are so guarded and rehearsed. Well, this is why. One stray word and you become fodder for the demagoguery machine. 
The very fact that a couple of ill-chosen words by pro-life candidates have become lightning rods this election season betrays the overwhelming bias of the press on this issue. Most Americans consider themselves to be pro-life. The pro-life posture is accordingly the mainstream view. An August CNN survey found that 52 percent say abortion should be illegal in all (15 percent) or most (37 percent) circumstances. A May Gallup survey found that more women call themselves pro-life (46 percent) than pro-choice (44 percent). But the press allies with the Democrats to smear pro-life candidates as "extremists."
Abortions that are the result of rape amount to fewer than 1 percent of all abortions. Yet the press treats these rare exceptions as central. What goes virtually unreported are the doctrinaire positions of liberal Democrats: They oppose waiting periods, parental notification, limits on sex selection abortions, restrictions on late-term or "partial birth" abortions, and laws protecting the lives of babies "accidentally" born alive following botched late term abortions. Has there ever been a political debate in which the pro-choice candidate was challenged about his or her positions on those questions?
It's obviously a ghastly thing for a woman to be raped and to find herself pregnant as a consequence. What Mourdock was saying, if inartfully, was that the child so conceived is innocent, and doesn't deserve to die because of the crime of his or her father. He understands that this is a tough issue. It makes everyone horribly uncomfortable. But the liberal answer — abort the child or else be accused of approving of rape — is a slimy abuse of tragedy and a disgrace to civil discourse.

I'd have to say that I am utterly and irrevocably pro-choice.  See, when a woman consensually engages in an activity that could result in her becoming pregnant, she's made her choice, free and clear.  Pregnancy is one possible consequence of coition.  If a woman chooses coition, she tacitly accepts the consequence.  Abortion is simply a means of escaping or avoiding those consequences.  Consequence-free action.  Wow.  So if you turn a corner and hit a pedestrian, it's okay because the corner was there and you just decided to turn because, #$%$, you just wanted to do it?  Sorry, Charlene.  Pro-choice means pro-consequence.

God gave humans the ability to choose what actions, good & bad, that they wish to take. that would include both rapes & abortions. These are not examples of God's will.

Talking heads, from both parties, confuse pro-life and pro-choice with anti-abortion and pro-abortion. Many women who are pro-life are also strongly in favor of leaving the choice up to the woman herself. Individual circumstances create differing choices. The age, finances, and health of the woman are variables that  impact each woman's decision. And that is, and should continue to be, her right. The government has no right to interfere in what is a very personal and private decision, whatever that decision may ultimately be!

What IS it about republican women pundits (Charen, Malkin Coulter, et al) that blinds them to the stupidity and evil in the statements made recklessly by male members of the GOP regarding topics of rape in particular and women's issues in general? Are they so willing to put party fealty above their own humanity and moral values (if any) that they will automatically issue mea culpas on behalf of these male mental midgets? These are either very stupid women (doubtful) or they have a depth of moral cowardice (likely) that calls into question their judgment, moral cores, and values!

I find very little more scary than politicians who take their orders from God and trump reason with faith. This is a disturbing trend toward theocratic thinking and abandonment of common sense. Reminds me of the day when the Malleus Maleficarum was law.

"But the liberal answer — abort the child or else be accused of approving of rape — is a slimy abuse of tragedy and a disgrace to civil discourse"

Mona knows from Slimy.Her quote abvoe,from the article,is particularly slimy.I know of no liberals who believe that,the liberals I know believe that it should be the woman's choice as to weather or not to terminate a pregnancy conceived through the act of rape.

Nailed it, Mona.
I want to know if President Obama's and other Democratic candidates and politicians' positions on the following MATCH EXACTLY with NARAL, Wasserman-Schulz, etc.

"waiting periods, parental notification, limits on sex selection abortions, restrictions on late-term or "partial birth" abortions, and laws protecting the lives of babies "accidentally" born alive following botched late term abortions."

If he doesn't match their positions exactly, I want to see Ed Schultz, Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews and Lawrence O'Donnell to criticize the president with the same joy and vigor that they they afford Republicans.

To all the men reaing this article, please ask the women in your life what is important to them, I have three sisters and we had a very frank discussion about rape and abortion. I was suprised in some ways and learned a lot about their struggles with the decisions they made in life regarding their children. I won't tell you which way to vote, but I encourage you to talk to women about this issue before you do. You may change your mind, you may not. At the very least you may learn a little more about the women in your life.

You can't have it both ways.  If life is an act of God, than the act that created it is also.  It's akin to saying God hates rape, except when he uses it to create life.

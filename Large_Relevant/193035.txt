New Orleans and the 'Super Gras'


Photographer Stephen McLaren is best known for his pictures capturing amusing moments and juxtapositions on the streets of the UK, yet a visit to the United States offered him a chance to visit New Orleans, home of Mardi Gras and host to this weekend's Super Bowl.
More than seven years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city, America will once more focus its attention on New Orleans as the San Francisco 49ers meet the Baltimore Ravens on 3 February.

Life behind the sea wall


Sixty years ago on the 1 February 1953 fierce storms battered the east coast of Britain and resulted in the deaths of more than 300 people, 24,000 homes were flooded and more than 30,000 people were left homeless.
In Canvey Island, Essex, the entire 13,000-strong population was moved to safety as the bad weather took hold and Essex police reported they had recovered bodies during the night. In fact 59 people died on the island.

Uncovering the past

As more of our daily lives move to the virtual, and for photographers hard copy prints or transparencies become a rarity, it is a treat to find a project that focuses on the world of analogue photography.
Anton Orlov runs the Photo Palace Bus from his base in San Diego, a travelling darkroom project dedicated to this art, and it is this love of the process, as well as the end result, that has led him to not one, but two, magnificent finds.

Inside Haiti's Iron Market

It is three years since a magnitude 7.0 earthquake hit the city of Port-au-Prince in Haiti, resulting in more than 200,000 deaths and one million being left homeless.
The disaster pushed the aid agencies to the limit. Much help was promised from around the globe, yet the scale of devastation and other complications led to delays.

Hidden Lives: The Untold Story of Urban Refugees

Photographer Andrew McConnell's latest work looks at the lives of urban refugees who have fled various conflicts from the past and present century.
Yet these are not the traditional pictures of refugees in transit camps. McConnell emphasises the urban setting, photographing his subjects at night, often picturing them against the vast ocean of artificial lights that illuminate the city streets.

The year in pictures
A brief post to point you towards our end of year galleries which highlight a selection of the best news photographs of 2012.
From the continuing unrest in the Middle East to the sporting achievement at the Olympics, there's a wide selection of work on show by photographers working for the major wire agencies. Their ability to encapsulate the story in one frame never ceases to amaze me, be it a dramatic moment or one of quiet reflection.

Picture power: Running for gold

In the final of a series of five articles where photographers are invited to talk about the back story to one of their pictures taken this year Owen Humphreys of the Press Association offers the story behind his award winning photograph of Mo Farah on his way to one of his two gold medals at this year's Olympics.
The London games was captured by a vast number of photographers, who for much of the time would be tied to their allocated position, with only a few allowed to roam. Despite the volume of pictures taken there are some that stand out and convey something of the determination required not just to compete, but to win.

Picture power: The price of war

In the third of a series of five articles where photographers are invited to talk about the back story to one of their pictures taken this year, Associated Press photographer Bernat Armangue speaks about how he obtained this moving picture during the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas.
On 14 November 2012 Israel launched its offensive against militants in Gaza, following an escalation of cross-border violence which has raged between the two sides for years. At least 158 Palestinians and six Israelis were killed in the eight-day conflict, which Israel said was aimed at halting rocket fire from the Palestinian territory.

Revolution through the lenses of Magnum photographers

Almost since the birth of photography, political unrest and conflict have drawn photographers to capture the drama of the moment, and in some cases to offer comment through their work.
Magnum Photos was brought to life in the aftermath of World War II by photographers Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, George Rodger and David "Chim" Seymour, each of whom was well acquainted with covering a changing world, where borders and allegiances were shifting as players set themselves for what was to become the Cold War.

Photography and open education

Photographic tuition usually falls in to two camps, the hands-on, throw yourself at it kind, and the more contemplative course where class-based tuition is key.
Yet there is another way - open learning, where the majority of the students interact online with the face-to-face course being taught in a more traditional manner. With this comes a chance to share in the knowledge being offered by a wide range of tutors, photographers and others in the industry.

Drowning world by Gideon Mendel

Photographer Gideon Mendel has spent much of his career documenting social issues around the globe and was one of the first to use photography to highlight the issue of HIV and Aids in Africa in the early 1990s. It was a piece of work that set out to challenge the stereotypical view of the struggle at that time, and broke new ground in terms of style.
One of his current projects, Drowning World, looks at the impact of flooding. On a recent assignment to Nigeria, Mendel released a number of pictures via the photography app, Instagram, alongside his more traditional work. It is an interesting departure and yet the resulting pictures are still very much in his style.

Portrait Salon projection

A photographic portrait is what draws many of us to photography, be it a family snapshot or a heavily constructed picture taken in a studio with all the trimmings.
Portraits are central to what makes photography so compelling, offering us a glimpse of our own past, drawing up long-forgotten moments or a glance at the lives of others.

Babel, the urge to pray by Viviana Peretti 


Viviana Peretti considers herself a street photographer, yet her latest work, Babel, the urge to pray, takes this one stage further.
Before Peretti came to New York she expected to find a secular and consumer-driven city. "I was really surprised by the rich, diverse, intense religious life present in each neighbourhood and the complex and sometimes complicated implications these different belief systems have for how people live their lives. The number of temples is overwhelming, but so is the media's indifference to this aspect of the city, as is their consistent tendency to sell the world the most glamour-focused, profane vision of New York."

Phil added analysis to:
The media mix-up that ruined my life
Photographs of those unfortunate enough to be caught up in news events, often in tragic circumstances, have always been sought by the media. They bring a sense of the person central to the story and allow readers to identify with them.
In the past, reporters on the ground would approach relatives for a hand-out picture, which agencies would syndicate to national and international media. But this takes time and today we consume, and demand, stories and photographs faster than ever before, which means news organisations will dig for those pictures on social media sites.

Crossing Paths with Niall McDiarmid

I'm guessing that most photographers run across interesting characters every day, faces in the crowd that we know would make a great picture. Sometimes we might stop and ask if we can take a portrait but most of the time we hurry on by.
Niall McDiarmid has done what we should all have done and has spent the past couple of years collecting portraits from the streets. Beautiful pictures they are too, with simple captions explaining where they were shot.

The Freetown I see 


Earlier this year I spoke to photographer Lee Karen Stow about her project in Sierra Leone where she has been training women to work in the industry.
Francess Ngaboh-Smart was one of the those who took part in Lee's first course in 2007 and has since made a new life as a photographer, using the camera to express her thoughts and dreams. But more than that she has received commissions from NGOs, the Special Courts Sierra Leone, and more recently the Commonwealth Secretariat of London.

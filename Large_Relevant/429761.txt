Egypt: Morsi comments on Jews taken out of contextBy HAMZA HENDAWI and SARAH EL DEEB | Associated Press – Wed, Jan 16, 2013

CAIRO (AP) — Comments on Jews made by Egypt's Islamist president nearly three years ago and labeled by the White House as "deeply offensive" were taken out of context, aimed at criticizing Israeli policies, not Jews, a presidential spokesman said on Wednesday.
A day earlier, the Obama administration admonished Morsi over the comments, which were revived when they were aired on an Egyptian TV show this month, and called on him to repudiate them.
At the time, in September 2010, Morsi was a leader in the Muslim Brotherhood. In the video, he refers to "Zionists" as "bloodsuckers who attack Palestinians" as well as "the descendants of apes and pigs."
On Wednesday, Morsi told a visiting U.S. Senate delegation led by Republican John McCain that a distinction must be made between criticism of what he called the "racist" policies of the Israelis against the Palestinians and insults against the Jewish faith, Morsi's spokesman Yasser Ali said.
"President Morsi assured the delegation that the broadcast comments were taken out of an address against the Israeli aggression against Gaza," Ali told reporters. "He also assured them of his respect for monolithic religions, freedom of belief and practicing religions."
The Obama administration's rebuke marked a new twist in the complex relationship between the U.S. and Egypt's Islamist leader, who became the country's first freely elected president in June. The two sides have been in a bond of mutual need: Egypt needs Washington's help in salvaging its sliding economy, Washington sees Morsi as a figure who — despite his rhetoric — maintains Egypt's relationship with Israel.
On Tuesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Morsi "should make clear that he respects people of all faiths and that this type of rhetoric is unacceptable in a democratic Egypt."
"We believe that President Morsi should make clear that he respects people," White House told reporters in Washington on Tuesday.
"We completely reject these statements as we do any language that espouses religious hatred," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters. "This kind of rhetoric has been used in this region for far too long. It's counter to the goals of peace."
Morsi has promised to abide by Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Morsi was also instrumental in facilitating a cease-fire in November between Israel and Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip, despite his refusal to speak directly with Israeli officials.
Egypt receives more than $1 billion a year in military and development aid from the U.S. as part of a package linked to its historic 1979 peace deal with Israel. The peace accord is a cornerstone of U.S. Mideast policy.
Nuland said Morsi's actions as president in support of the peace treaty with Israel are laudable but only one part of picture.
"We will judge him by what he does," she said. "What he has been doing is supporting that peace treaty, continuing to work with us, and with Israel on common goals, including in Gaza. But we'll also judge him but what he says. And we think that these comments should be repudiated and they should be repudiated firmly."
An official in Israel, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about an issue of such sensitivity, said Tuesday that Morsi's comments were a "big concern" but that Israel did not want to fuel tensions with Egypt.

jews. jews. jews, jews jews. jews, jews, jews, jews, jews, jews, jews, jews.

i know that hurt SO bad. jews would be a "race". "zionists" mean to occupy. morsi is a monchichi savior like that recent "defacement" of los hey-soos in that church or whatever. same inhuman/subhuman forehead. he is the last to pick on a race.

he was JUST being a bigot against another groups religion; NOT their race.

Political Translation:

Don't hold me responsible for what I said and for the sake of getting
along pretend that what I said can be interpreted in a way that is not offensive
in spite of the fact that I reserve the right to be offended at whatever you
say in whatever context I choose to take it in for my own purposes, as well
as react in a manner that is wholly out of proportion to the nature of the "offense".

Simple Translation:
Act and react in the manner that will benefit me best.

How many people would of been killed by mob violence if you would of used the word Muslim instead of Zionist,they would of been rioting and protesting across the Islamic world. This religion if one can call it that, is so hypocritical that it has become laughable that is if it wasn't so damn scary.

How is that taken out of context? It falls perfectly within what the Brotherhood believes in!

"He also assured them of his respect for monolithic religions, freedom of belief and practicing religions."

So, it means he does not respect atheists, Hindus and Buddhists? BTW, speaking of respect, Copts, the original Egyptians, are Christian, and they are constantly harrased in Egypt.

Let's put these comments in context...

Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are "a waste of time and opportunities" as Arabs and Muslims get nothing out of engagement with "the descendants of apes and pigs," current Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi asserted in September 2010, according to newly translated interviews published this week by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).

In the first interview, aired on Lebanon's Al-Quds TV on September 23, 2010, Morsi denounced the Palestinian Authority as a creation of "the Zionist and American enemies for the sole purpose of opposing the will of the Palestinian people." Therefore, he stressed, "No reasonable person can expect any progress on this track."

"Either [you accept] the Zionists and everything they want, or else it is war," Morsi said, "This is what these occupiers of the land of Palestine know – these blood-suckers, who attack the Palestinians, these warmongers, the descendants of apes and pigs."

In the result, according to MEMRI, Morsi called on Arabs and Muslims worldwide to "employ all forms of resistance against...those criminal Zionists, who attack Palestine and the Palestinians."

"Pressure should be exerted upon them," Morsi continued, so that Jews should "not be given any opportunity [to] stand on any Arab or Islamic land."

In a separate interview translated by MEMRI, aired on the same network on March 20, 2010, Morsi affirmed that "The Zionists have no right to the land of Palestine.... What they took before 1947-8 constitutes plundering, and what they are doing now is a continuation of this plundering. By no means do we recognize their Green Line. The land of Palestine belongs to the Palestinians, not to the Zionists."

He therefore called on the Islamic world "to confront this Zionist entity" and to severe "all ties of all kinds...with this plundering criminal entity," including a total boycott of Israel and the avoidance of "normalization of relations with it."

Morsi concluded that the Arab-Islamic world "want[s] a country for the Palestinians on the entire land of Palestine...[and] all the talk about a two-state solution and about peace is nothing but an illusion."

The Jews, he said, "have been fanning the flames of civil strife wherever they were throughout history. They are hostile by nature.... The Zionists understood nothing but the language of force."

9 out 10 Muslim clerics are the same way as Morsi. These rats curse Israel and then deny it.

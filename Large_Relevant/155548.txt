what does it matter?
Beckham makes a monthly $540.000 in America, he won't come here for free surely. Even if PSG pays him less, say 400k a month, that is going to charity over his 5 months contract, which means he has then donated 2 MILLION euro. How much have you done?
Standing ovation for Becks over﻿ here. If he still keeps some money from this or that, good for him.

Whatsup﻿ whit all the hate??
He could just have taken that money.
He is playing for free for a season and donating the money,ask that to Ronaldo or Messi,they will leave the club before doing something like that.
Its fucking disgusting watching people talk shit about rich people who are actually doing big things and the hugest example is Bill Gate,who donated over 40.000 millons to charity yet people talk shit about him.
Let the hating begin!

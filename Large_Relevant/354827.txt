Im xbox and the reason why our map packs﻿ come 1 month earlier is because we have to pay $10/month; $25/3month; or as i use $60/year .. It kinda balances it out tbh

I honestly like all the maps, like you said it kept things fresh. The maps are well designed and colorful so it makes the fisuals pop and keeps things interesting as you run and gun. I do to like them better then the original maps, except maybe for hijacked. That is﻿ like my absolute favorite map

lol. microsoft has a contract and two ps3 dlc add ons dont always work. skyrim for example the dlc's just didn't work out for the ps3 and now bethesda has to come up with new coding to help get those dlc's working for the ps3. luckly bethesda finally is going to release﻿ all skyrim dlc's onto the ps3. as you can see xbox is better.

well i love the peacekeeper, my fav map is grind, stricktly because i ride scooters for a living so i know the way around a skate park and stuff. downhill is pretty good but i dont really go and play alot of snow maps, hydro is epic to, i like how u can be in the water but then have to get out or u will be killed, and mirage, well tbh i didnt get the feel of it,﻿ it is just abit not to my liking too much, die rise is epic, hard to find my way round tho. and turned is like omfg im a fucking zombie

Meh. Peacekeeper is one of those guns that try to fit multiple roles, but is not great at any of them.
Close range, loses to any other SMG. Long range, loses to any other﻿ AR. It's an alright gun, just would prefer something with a more specific role. :P

@par cor Sorry to ruin your parade, but﻿ Revolution is 15USD not sixty bucks. That is the season pass for all upcoming DLC's.

sorry but sixty bucks for maps is ridiculous. If you want it for free though borrow a freinds account﻿ who has the DLC and download it from them. Personally I wouldn't even bother cause BO2 isn't worth my time.

But do you think the ps3 doesn't﻿ want buyers or consumers either? That's partly the reason the ps3 online service is free. So it attracts people. Get it? Both companies want money. But sometimes some people just get better advantages in this 'little war'.

I seriously hate the comments below about how one console deserves to get it first and ps3 'sucks shit'. Look, you don't pay for Xbox live to get the maps earlier. You pay for Xbox live to be online. The early DLC's are just an addition. Do you think people would buy a console where you have to pay for online service and yet get nothing in return while the﻿ ps3 users are free? No. Microsoft is smarter than that. They know what attracts buyers and consumers. Sure, I maybe guarding my console

I think if u payed for the season pass u should get the DLC earlier for PS3! maybe not the same time as xbox but we shouldnt have to wait a month!﻿ I also feel they should have fixed the game b4 they came out with DLC.... now we get to play new maps on the same broken game

Thats one of reasons why i think battle field will always that advantage over Cod More guns bigger maps & the content comes on ps3 first dont get wrong Cod was my shi & it still is but its just the same old close courters box in map game play & the fact the finally add one weapon dont make no differnce to that should started that along with select fire on mw2 & probably if BF4 comes out thats going to nock﻿ cod of the charts

Looking for REVOLUTION gameplay? Want to know the Sliquifier Glitch? How about watch a 6 Kill feed with the﻿ PEACEKEEPER. Come on over to my channel and check it out.
Now I wouldn't be doing this﻿ if people didn't enjoy my videos, I have gained over 200 Subs in the past 24 hours. When yesterday i only had 400+ Subs. So people obviously enjoy my stuff. Maybe you will too.
Sorry for Spam, But right now youtube is difficult for a newcomer to gain an audience.I started 3 weeks ago so i am new.

I gotta say that the whole people not liking snow maps isn't necessarily true. Array, Grid, WMD and Summit﻿ were all great maps. It's just people wouldn't like them if the did bad in a game. The Peacekeeper seems like it would be better with a little les recoil. And how is it not fair that xbox players get the maps first? Microsoft has a contract in which they pay to receive the DLC first AND xbox players pay for their online experience. Not trying to be a dick just throwing out the facts. -Balls

The peacekeeper is on the disk. The dlc just unlocked it. Because people without the dlc can pick it up and use it. 2nd people on﻿ Xbox live pay yearly fees, thus that is why Xbox live gamers have it better. Fuck Sony

Black ops is gay. I hate both games and im glad i didnt spend money﻿ on this one. The looks are just too cartoonish i guess. Icant find the right word but it just doesnt appeal to me. Also the lag is ridiculous! Every other game my connection is amazing except treyarch games. I havent tried zombies but it looks stupid. MW2 & MW3 were both better than the black ops. Please dont only post these games now its not entertaining to watch

In my opinion people I understand people who play ps3...but at the same token they don't pay a subscription like us Xbox users do. So﻿ Xbox needs an insentive to purchase their system. So that's why the made the contract with Activision. That's just making a good business move on the side of Microsoft..

how is it confusing. to get any gun diamond, you have to have all other guns in that catagory gold. then they all get diamond. all they did was throw in a new gun, so you just have to level up. its not like some retard who dosnt have any gold guns is going to think he gets﻿ a new gun and can automatically get it diamond.

okay, let's be professional here, domeb thumbsticks are good, but the shoot button aka R1 doesn't go as deep as the RT on Xbox and you can fire really fast, and the positions of the thumbsticks are good, right next to each other﻿ AND i almost forgot, the killstreak calling in pad is better than on xbox

Yes well they have never put in a new gun in dlc before because contrary to popular belief CoD tends not to be an﻿ ass hole to people who bought the base game
What I'm staying is that CoD has never really actively secluded people who only have the base game by adding actual new content that can be carried over into old content areas (excluding new prestiges) this means that just because you don't want to spend another $20 right after spending an initial $50-$60 you are at a disadvantage

Looking for REVOLUTION gameplay? Want to know the Sliquifier Glitch? How about watch a 6 Kill feed with the PEACEKEEPER. Come on over to my channel and check it out.
Now I wouldn't be doing this if people didn't enjoy my videos, I have gained over 200 Subs in the past 24 hours. When yesterday i only had 400+ Subs. So people obviously enjoy my stuff. Maybe you will too.
Sorry for Spam, But right now youtube is difficult﻿ for a newcomer to gain an audience.I started 3 weeks ago so i am new.
TY!

paying for xbox live gives microsoft money so they bought rights towards getting the map pack first which ultimately gets them more money as people﻿ will choose xbox rather than ps3

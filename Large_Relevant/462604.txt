Don't hit the movie for the resolution quality or the old special effects. If you manage﻿ to forgive that (because the movie is old) then you'll enjoy it 200% !

Hi there!
If you're not interested﻿ in Adventure maps, please ignore this comment! I'm a 22 year-old programmer & writer. I wouldn't normally do this, and I don't advertise here to have subscribers/fame or﻿ anything. I don't care about that! I'm only looking for intelligent/decent players who would take a look at my latest project, and have an amazing time playing it.
Thanks for reading guys. Please watch the video if you're interested:

The real back to the future car is a tricked out Delorean with a flux capacitor. A Delorean can't get higher than about 65 mph. with all the weight and considering the fact that it was a USED car when Doc. Brown got it, I doubt that in the film it got﻿ over 50. But then again, it is a classic so lets say it could go past 99.9 mph. Hehehe. I can't watch the actual movie with anyone because I start saying the lines out loud and I get really annoying.

I wish Jeb makes an update with the command blocks so that you can teleport mine carts whilst riding them, and/or teleport from and into mine carts. You can have three places being the "past", "present" and "future", then with a set of command blocks and redstone you can make it look like﻿ you can﻿ travel through time. ACtennisAC did something similar, with an HG Wells-style time machine. You guys should check his video of it -- youtube.com/watch?v=iZeKHcXrj­­Wc. :D

Does the activator rail activate Command blocks?
If so, why not just use that to TP you, to﻿ and from the stations.

some points
a. use a detector rail to output a redstone signal.
b. command blocks doesn't teleport carts, only﻿ people.
c. even if you were in the cart, minecraft would teleport you back to the original location of the cart, not to the destination.

a few﻿ things. This was designed to be used in survival. No command blocks in survival. Also the command block wouldn't teleport the minecart to my knowledge. No activator rails were used anywhere in this station design.

Try it. It doesn't work. You'll get teleported straight back﻿ in your minecart. And if you're not, you'll lose your minecart during the teleport.

They do get﻿ activated like that but the tp feature of them is hindered when the player is riding in a minecart. Its something weird I have tested before. Its very random at times and sometime it might work.

I wish Jeb makes an update with the command blocks so that you can teleport players *into* mine carts. You can have three places being the "past", "present" and "future", then with a set of command blocks, redstone and a time-traveling mine cart for each you can make it look like you can travel through time. ACtennisAC did something similar, with an HG Wells-style time machine. You guys should check his video (youtube.com/watch?v=iZeKHcXrj­Wc). :D﻿

You did it wrong.
88 chunks per hour times 16 blocks per chunks = 1408 blocks per hour.
1408 blocks per hour = 1408 meter per hour
1408 meter diveded by 1000 = 1.408 km/h
still﻿ slow but that is something diffrent.

88 blocks is 30 kilometers? Where do you get this info from. That would mean that Steve is ~600 meters tall.
No no no. One block is one meter.
Thus a mile is 1610m. A minecart can go 8m/s, which is 2,4km in 3 minutes, not "1k". Also,﻿ it's roughly 18Mph

I think I meant to move a decimal 3 places and I ended up saying 30 k cause three was on my brain.
But I'm still certain that 88 miles is closer to 140 km/140,000 meters. I said under three minutes because I space out my powered rails 1/30 blocks to conserve materials and I recall recording a video of me traveling﻿ back and forth on my minecart, but I couldn't remember how long it was.

2.4 km equals about 48 km in an hour at that rate. Which would be﻿ more than 18 mph. Unless you meant to say that in reality, the minecart actually goes 18mph.

Yessir, the minecart is locked at a max of 8 m/s but it has an internal speed so if it were going on only powered rails it would go at 8m/s once it came off until the internal speed gets exhausted, at which point it would begin﻿ to slow down

Also, a mint condition Delorean can do ~65 mph. Doc Brown's Delorean was a USED car, plus with the reactor under the hood and all the extra weight from other features that were needed, it probably wouldn't have gotten above 50 mph. But then again, its a﻿ classic, so if Doc said it went 99.9 mph, I would TOTALLY believe him. Hehehe. Come see my channel. I don't have many movies yet, but you seem like my kind of guy.

1 MC block = 1 m
1 mph = 0.44704 m/s
88 mph = 39.34 m/s
So its about 39 blocks per second, which is almost 2 blocks per tick. I promise you that no﻿ minecart will ever travel that fast.

But what about the﻿ minecart? I don't think you get teleported with the minecart and I can't force a player to teleport to another cart, he will have to click on it to get in.
And last. he sayed he tryed to make something that is possible to build in survival.

The human eye can see things at around 30fps. so any higher would be a waste. Hence why if you are looking out the window during a car ride and things start to get blury﻿ when you speed up. a video editor you would make the video at around 25fps. just sayin. Games are normally run at 50fps on Xbox and PS3's .ect

Wrong, the unit "Planck time" is a unit of time which is the smallest possible time ever, it's 10^−43 seconds, so the real world does have a limited﻿ Fps (obviously it doesn't work the exact same way as a computer does).

Err, you need to learn some universe physics. The universe does not work in "frames" that only applies to images such as movies, games, etc. The universe, and how we﻿ precise motion of real life, is in terms of light, which is constant, it' snot referenced in so called frames. Otherwise "infinite" FPS would just mean very very slow life, because if it took, say, 3 billion frames to pass a second that would be incredibly slow, no, light is how things go.

23* and that is not even right. The 23 fps (IRL) is﻿ where the picture change from still to blurry.
This means there is no limit of fps but the quality will actually just become worse after 23.

Go to Mojangs website. (Or google Minecraft snapshot)
Download the﻿ minecraft.jar file.
Put the minecraft.jar file in your Minecraft folder, in the bin file. (You can find the Minecraft folder by pressing "Windows key"+R and typing %appdata%
Replace the old minecraft.jar file with the snapshots ".jar" file.
Done.
To revert to the old (Standard minecraft) just force an update in the launcher.

To be exact, Mister Bling, if you want the cart to time travel into﻿ the future, you have to actually make it appear at the destination before it even starts going forward. If you manage to do that, I will eat a shoe

No you can't, I've tried it before. When you do, it seems as if you teleport. It looks like your still in the cart to everyone else, (because you are), but on your screen,﻿ it looks like you're walking around with the sitting animation. If you relog you're back in the minecart/boat.

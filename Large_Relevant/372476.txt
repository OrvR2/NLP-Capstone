China

                            China (i/ˈtʃaɪnə/; Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó; see also Names of China), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is the world's most-populous country, with a population of over 1.3 billion. Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometres, the East Asian state is the world's second-largest country by land area, and the third- or fourth-largest in total area, depending on the definition of total area.

The People's Republic of China is a single-party state governed by the Communist Party of China. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four directly controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). Its capital city is Beijing. The PRC also claims Taiwan—which is controlled by the Republic of China (ROC), a separate political entity—as its 23rd province, a claim controversial due to the complex political status of Taiwan and the unresolved Chinese Civil War. The PRC government denies the legitimacy of the ROC.

Ethiopia

                            Ethiopia ( /ˌiːθiˈoʊpiə/) (Ge'ez: ኢትዮጵያ ʾĪtyōṗṗyā), officially known as the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, is a landlocked country located in the Horn of Africa. It is the second-most populous nation in Africa, with over 82 million inhabitants, and the tenth largest by area, occupying 1,100,000 km2. Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south. With its capital at Addis Ababa, it is also the most populous landlocked nation in the world.

Ethiopia was a monarchy for most of its history, and the Ethiopian dynasty traces its roots to the 2nd century BC. Ethiopia is also one of the oldest sites of human existence known to scientists today, having yielded some of humanity's oldest traces. It may be the region from which Homo sapiens first set out for the Middle East and points beyond. Alongside Rome, Persia, China and India, the Ethiopian Aksum Empire was considered one of the great world powers of the 3rd century. During the Scramble for Africa, Ethiopia was the only African country beside Liberia that retained its sovereignty as a recognized independent country, and was one of only four African members of the League of Nations. After a brief period of Italian occupation, Ethiopia became a charter member of the United Nations. When other African nations received their independence following World War II, many of them adopted the colors of Ethiopia's flag, and Addis Ababa became the location of several international organizations focused on Africa.

India

                            India (i/ˈɪndiə/), officially the Republic of India (Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by geographical area, the second-most populous country with over 1.2 billion people, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the south-west, and the Bay of Bengal on the south-east, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north-east; and Burma and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; in addition, India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.

Home to the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history. Four of the world's major religions—Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism—originated here, whereas Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived in the 1st millennium CE and also helped shape the region's diverse culture. Gradually annexed by and brought under the administration of the British East India Company from the early 18th century and administered directly by the United Kingdom from the mid-19th century, India became an independent nation in 1947 after a struggle for independence that was marked by non-violent resistance led by Mahatma Gandhi.

Sweden

                            Sweden (i/ˈswiːdən/ SWEE-dən; Swedish: Sverige [ˈsværjɛ] ( listen)), officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish:  Konungariket Sverige (help·info)), is a Nordic country on the Scandinavian Peninsula in Northern Europe. Sweden borders with Norway and Finland, and is connected to Denmark by a bridge-tunnel across the Øresund.

At 450,295 square kilometres (173,860 sq mi), Sweden is the third largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of about 9.4 million. Sweden has a low population density of 21 inhabitants per square kilometre (54 /sq mi) with the population mostly concentrated to the southern half of the country. About 85% of the population live in urban areas. Sweden's capital city is Stockholm, which is also the largest city.

Sweden emerged as an independent and unified country during the Middle Ages. In the 17th century, the country expanded its territories to form the Swedish Empire. The empire grew to be one of the great powers of Europe in the 17th and early 18th century. Most of the conquered territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were lost during the 18th and 19th centuries. The eastern half of Sweden, present-day Finland, was lost to Russia in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814, when Sweden by military means forced Norway into a personal union. Since then, Sweden has been at peace, practicing "non-participation in military alliances during peacetime and neutrality during wartime". However, Sweden has been a member of the European Union since 1 January 1995 and is a member of the OECD.

Uxmal

                            Uxmal (Yucatec Maya: Óoxmáal [óˑʃmáˑl]) is an ancient Mayan city of the classical period. Today it is one of the most important archaeological sites of Mayan culture, along with those of Chichen Itza and Tikal. It is located in the Puuc region and is considered one of the Maya cities most representative of the region's dominant architectural style.

It is located 62 km south of Mérida, capital of Yucatán state in Mexico. Its buildings are noted for their size and decoration. Linking the buildings, as well as to other cities in the area such as Chichén Itzá and Tikal in modern-day Guatemala, are ancient roads left by the Mayans called sacbes.

Its buildings are typical of the Puuc style, with smooth low walls that open on ornate friezes based on representations of typical Mayan huts, which are represented by columns (representing the reeds with which were built the walls of the huts) and trapezoidal shapes (representing the thatched roofs), entwined snakes and, in many cases two-headed snakes, masks of the rain god, Chaac with its big noses that represent the rays of the storms, and feathered serpents with open fangs leaving from the same human beings. Also seen in some cities influences of Nahua origin and the follow of the cult of Quetzalcoatl and Tlaloc that were integrated with the original bases of the Puuc tradition.

Celts

                            The Celts (usually pronounced  /ˈkɛlts/ but sometimes /ˈsɛlts/, see pronunciation of Celtic) or Kelts were an ethno-linguistic group of tribal societies in Iron Age and Medieval Europe who spoke Celtic languages and had a similar culture.

The earliest archaeological culture that may justifiably be considered as Proto-Celtic is the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of central Europe from the last quarter of the second millennium BC. Their fully Celtic descendants in central Europe were the people of the Iron Age Hallstatt culture (c. 800-450 BC) named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt, Austria. By the later La Tène period (c. 450 BC up to the Roman conquest), this Celtic culture had expanded over a wide range of regions, whether by diffusion or migration: to the British Isles (Insular Celts), France and The Low Countries (Gauls), much of Central Europe, the Iberian Peninsula (Celtiberians, Celtici and Gallaeci) and northern Italy (Golaseccans and Cisalpine Gauls) and following the Gallic invasion of the Balkans in 279 BC as far east as central Anatolia (Galatians).

Cerdic of Wessex

                            Cerdic (from the early British name represented by modern Welsh Caradog) was probably the first King of Anglo-Saxon Wessex from 519 to 534, cited by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as the founder of the kingdom of Wessex and ancestor of all its subsequent kings. (See House of Wessex family tree).

According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Cerdic landed in Hampshire in 495 with his son Cynric in three ships. He is said to have fought a British king named Natanleod at Netley Marsh in Hampshire and killed him thirteen years later (in 508) and to have fought at Cerdicesleag (Charford, Cerdic's Ford) in 519, after which he became first king of Wessex. The conquest of the Isle of Wight is also mentioned among his campaigns, and it was later given to his kinsmen, Stuf and Wihtgar (who had supposedly arrived with the West Saxons in 514). Cerdic is said to have died in 534 and was succeeded by his son Cynric.

The early history of Wessex in the Chronicle is clearly muddled  and enters duplicate reports of events. David Dumville has suggested that Cerdic's true regnal dates are 538-554. Some scholars suggest that Cerdic was the Saxon leader defeated by the British at the Battle of Mount Badon, which was probably fought sometime between 490 and 518. This cannot be the case if Dumville is correct, and others assign this battle to Ælle or another Saxon leader.

Erzhu Shilong

                            Erzhu Shilong (爾朱世隆) (500–532), courtesy name Rongzong (榮宗), was an official of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Wei. He first became prominent when after his cousin Erzhu Rong overthrew Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu (after she poisoned Emperor Xiaoming) and made Emperor Xiaozhuang emperor. Later, when Emperor Xiaozhuang killed Erzhu Rong in 530, Erzhu Shilong participated in the counterattack that overthrew Emperor Xiaozhuang, and thereafter controlled the imperial government during the reign of Emperor Jiemin. When the general Gao Huan, in turn, rebelled in response to Emperor Xiaozhuang's death, the officials in the imperial capital Luoyang rebelled against the Erzhus, and Erzhu Shilong was executed after failing to flee Luoyang.

Erzhu Shilong was a cousin of Erzhu Rong and a fellow member of the ethnic Xiongnu Qihu (契胡) tribe, of which Erzhu Rong was chief. (They were at most as close as second cousins, as they did not have the same grandfather.) Unlike Erzhu Rong, who served his entire career as a general and not a civilian official, Erzhu Shilong was part of the imperial administration during the reign of Emperor Xiaoming, although he became a commander of the imperial guards as well.

Fergus Mór

                            Fergus Mór mac Eirc (Scottish Gaelic: Fergus Mòr Mac Earca; English: Fergus the Great) was a legendary king of Dál Riata. He was the son of Erc.

While his historicity may be debatable, his posthumous importance as the founder of Scotland in the national myth of Medieval and Renaissance Scotland is not in doubt. Rulers of Scotland from Cináed mac Ailpín until the present time claim descent from Fergus Mór.

The historical record, such as it is, consists of an entry in the Annals of Tigernach, for the year 501, which states: Feargus Mor mac Earca cum gente Dal Riada partem Britaniae tenuit, et ibi mortuus est. (Fergus Mór mac Eirc, with the people of Dál Riata, held part of Britain, and he died there.) However, the forms of Fergus, Erc and Dál Riata are later ones, written down long after the 6th century. The record in the Annals has given rise to theories of invasions of Argyll from Ireland, but these are not considered authentic.

Fergus is also found in the king lists of Dál Riata, and later of Scotland, of which the Senchus Fer n-Alban and the Duan Albanach can be taken as examples. The Senchus states that Fergus Mór was also known as Mac Nisse Mór. These sources probably date from the 10th and 11th centuries respectively, between 30 and 40 generations after Fergus may have lived.

King Arthur

                            King Arthur is a legendary British leader of the late 5th and early 6th centuries, who, according to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the early 6th century. The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention, and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians. The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas. Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin.

The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). Some Welsh and Breton tales and poems relating the story of Arthur date from earlier than this work; in these works, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.

Procopius

                            Procopius of Caesarea (Latin: Procopius Caesarensis, Ancient Greek: Προκόπιος ὁ Καισαρεύς; c. AD 500 – c. AD 565) was a prominent Byzantine scholar from Palestine. Accompanying the general Belisarius in the wars of the Emperor Justinian I, he became the principal historian of the 6th century, writing the Wars of Justinian, the Buildings of Justinian and the celebrated Secret History. He is commonly held to be the last major historian of the ancient world.

Apart from his own writings, the main source for Procopius' life is an entry in the Suda, a 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia that tells nothing about his early life. He was a native of Caesarea in Palaestina Prima (modern Israel). He would have received a conventional élite education in the Greek classics and then rhetoric, perhaps at the famous School of Gaza, may have attended law school, possibly at Berytus (modern Beirut) or Constantinople, and became a rhetor (barrister or advocate). He evidently knew Latin, as was natural for a man with legal training. In 527, the first year of Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I's reign, he became the adsessor (legal adviser) for Belisarius, Justinian's chief military commander who was then beginning a brilliant career.

Tribonian

                            Tribonian or Tribonianos (Τριβωνιανός [trivonia'nos], c. 500–547) was a jurist during the reign of the Emperor Justinian I, who revised the legal code of the Roman Empire.

Tribonian was born in Pamphylia around the year 500. He became a successful lawyer in Constantinople, and was appointed by Justinian in 528 as one of the commissioners to prepare the new imperial legal code, the Corpus Juris Civilis, released in 529. In 530 he became quaestor sacri palatii, and the chief editor of the compilation of the old Roman lawyers writings (Digesta or Pandecta, meaning Digest or Collection), which in total were much larger than the code itself.

The brief version of the new code, Codex repetitae praelectionis, containing the most relevant and useful parts of the selection of imperial constitutions, was released in 533. While this was being completed the participants in the Nika riots of 532 called for his removal because of his alleged corruption. He was temporarily removed by Justinian until the riots were crushed. In 534 the full Codex Justinianus was released, along with a series of new laws created by Justinian to reflect contemporary needs (the Novellae). His life is recounted in the writings of Procopius.

Zu Chongzhi

                            Zu Chongzhi (simplified Chinese: 祖冲之; traditional Chinese: 祖沖之; pinyin: Zǔ Chōngzhī; Wade–Giles: Tsu Ch'ung-chih) (429–500), courtesy name Wenyuan (文遠), was a prominent Chinese mathematician and astronomer during the Liu Song and Southern Qi Dynasties.

Chongzhi's ancestry was from modern Baoding, Hebei. To flee from the ravage of war, Zu's grandfather Zu Chang moved to the Yangtze, as part of the massive population movement during the Eastern Jin. Zu Chang (祖昌) at one point held the position of "Minister of Great Works" ) within the Liu Song and was in charge of government construction projects. Zu's father, Zu Shuo (祖朔) also served the court and was greatly respected for his erudition.

Zu was born in Jiankang. His family had historically been involved in astronomy research, and from childhood Zu was exposed to both astronomy and mathematics. When he was only a youth his talent earned him much repute. When Emperor Xiaowu of Liu Song heard of him, he was sent to an Academy, the Hualin Xuesheng (華林學省), and later at the Imperial Nanjing University (Zongmingguan) to perform research. In 461 in Nanxu (today Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), he was engaged in work at the office of the local governor.

500 Magnum vs Watermelons

Order: Reorder
Duration: 2:13
Updated: 31 Jan 2013


The mighty .500 S&W Magnum demonstrates its massive authority in a little bit of fun.! I always wondered what a "watermelon shower" was like. Now I know quite well. :-) Ammo used in this video was HSM .500 S&W 350 Grain JHP. I have some 400 grain Magtech soft point. They both kick really hard; I could not tell any difference. PLEASE try to avoid revealing your ignorance about how the economy works and why there are people starving. If you think destroying these watermelons was "heartless" or contributing to somebody's starvation, I feel sorry for you. I suggest that even if you think this that you refrain from commenting to that effect; believe me, it just makes you look very ignorant. Sorry, but the truth hurts. :-) Also, any racist comments will result in being blocked. Also, perhaps you do NOT understand economic principles and food distribution issues. Either way, I invite you to make a donation to a great organization and my favorite charity: The Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee. www.secondharvestmidtn.org They simply help feed people - with virtually NO religious or political strings attached, which is important to me. 615.329.3491

.500 MAGNUM IS FOR GIRLS! - FateofDestinee

Check out my *new website* for firearms related content! thearmsguide.com Facebook - http Website - www.fateofdestinee.com FateofDestinee on Instragram too! http ...it's for this girl, anyway. But what has been surprising to me has been the volume of comments from males (and females) who say they would never shoot the Smith and Wesson Model 500. As with any firearm, it should be taken seriously and handled with caution, but that doesn't mean it should be feared. The .500 Magnum rounds have some mad kick, but that doesn't make the Model 500 uncontrollable. It just means that the shooter needs to exercise some extra force of grip, and use both hands. The experience of shooting the Model 500 reminds me of punching a weight bag. When you hit a punching bag, you can feel the impact where your fist connects the bag, but it travels up through your wrist, your arm, and your shoulder. The kick of the .500 Magnum is similar. When you shoot, you feel the recoil in your grip, but it also rocks back into your wrists and arms. I even feel the muscles in my shoulders and upper back tensing more with the extra effort that magnitude of recoil requires. Now, what could be the use of a hand cannon like that? Other than, maybe bear hunting, or the occasional Godzilla sighting, I can't see a real practical application for the Model 500. I mean, the gun itself is a whopping 56oz (specifically the model with the 3" barrel and 1" compensator - the longer barreled models are even heavier), so ...

Updated: 31 Jan 2013


While the CBR500R, CB500F and CB500X are focused in different directions they are all physically easy to manage, and deliver all-round practicality matched to excellent efficiency. As true middleweights, blessed with lightweight agility and an engaging power delivery, above all, they are also enjoyable to ride in every scenario. A perfect platform from which to experience the fun and freedom that motorcycling brings, the CB500F makes a great first "full-size" bike for any rider -- and with its high build quality, affordable price point and low running costs will also make a great long-term partner and practical choice for riders of all experience levels. The CB500X, with its relaxed, upright riding position and wide handlebars will give anyone looking for their first adventure sports bike an exhilarating experience on a twisty, winding road. Its lightweight manouvrability and excellent visibility also ensure it works equally well in urban environments and it's a motorcycle designed to be ridden -- and thoroughly enjoyed -- by a variety of people of all shapes and sizes. For riders looking to move up from a 125, or holding an A2 licence, the fully faired twin-cylinder CBR500R provides an excellent first big sports bike experience, which will also appeal to experienced riders looking for a great value alternative to larger sports bikes. The CBR500R is part of a new family of motorcycles from Honda that includes the naked CB500F and adventure sports CB500X.

I would wait 500 years just to steal one kiss Drive across the universe searching for your lips. I would climb the Eiffel Tower in a lightning storm Just to hear your gorgeous voice say I am yours. Nothing in this world will keep me from your arms. I wanna know I changed the rhythm of your beating heart. The moment that I saw your face you sent a current through my sleeping veins. I swear I felt the subway shake when the doors closed on that downtown train. And you flew away. Too far away. I'd travel through eternity like a fearless child.

500 Magnum vs Watermelons


				
					The mighty .500 S&W Magnum demonstrates its massive authority in a little bit of fun.! I always wondered what a "watermelon shower" was like. Now I know quite well. :-) Ammo used in this video was HSM .500 S&W 350 Grain JHP. I have some 400 grain Magtech soft point. They both kick really hard; I could not tell any difference. PLEASE try to avoid revealing your ignorance about how the economy works and why there are people starving. If you think destroying these watermelons was "heartless" or contributing to somebody's starvation, I feel sorry for you. I suggest that even if you think this that you refrain from commenting to that effect; believe me, it just makes you look very ignorant. Sorry, but the truth hurts. :-) Also, any racist comments will result in being blocked. Also, perhaps you do NOT understand economic principles and food distribution issues. Either way, I invite you to make a donation to a great organization and my favorite charity: The Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee. www.secondharvestmidtn.org They simply help feed people - with virtually NO religious or political strings attached, which is important to me. 615.329.3491

.500 MAGNUM IS FOR GIRLS! - FateofDestinee


				
					Check out my *new website* for firearms related content! thearmsguide.com Facebook - http Website - www.fateofdestinee.com FateofDestinee on Instragram too! http ...it's for this girl, anyway. But what has been surprising to me has been the volume of comments from males (and females) who say they would never shoot the Smith and Wesson Model 500. As with any firearm, it should be taken seriously and handled with caution, but that doesn't mean it should be feared. The .500 Magnum rounds have some mad kick, but that doesn't make the Model 500 uncontrollable. It just means that the shooter needs to exercise some extra force of grip, and use both hands. The experience of shooting the Model 500 reminds me of punching a weight bag. When you hit a punching bag, you can feel the impact where your fist connects the bag, but it travels up through your wrist, your arm, and your shoulder. The kick of the .500 Magnum is similar. When you shoot, you feel the recoil in your grip, but it also rocks back into your wrists and arms. I even feel the muscles in my shoulders and upper back tensing more with the extra effort that magnitude of recoil requires. Now, what could be the use of a hand cannon like that? Other than, maybe bear hunting, or the occasional Godzilla sighting, I can't see a real practical application for the Model 500. I mean, the gun itself is a whopping 56oz (specifically the model with the 3" barrel and 1" compensator - the longer barreled models are even heavier), so ...

Midnight Sun | Iceland


                    BEST VIEWED IN HD AND FULLSCREEN (with scaling off)

Midnight Sun: A natural phenomenon occurring in the summer months north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle where the sun never fully sets and remains visible 24 hours a day. 

This short time lapse film was shot during the Icelandic Midnight Sun in June of 2011.

For 17 days I travelled solo around the entire island shooting almost 24 hours, sleeping in the car, and eating whenever I had the time. During my days shooting this film I shot 38,000 images, travelled some 2900 miles, and saw some of the most amazing, beautiful, and indescribable landscapes on the planet. Iceland is absolutely one of the most beautiful and unusual places you could ever imagine. Especially during the Midnight Sun when the quality of light hitting the landscape is very unusual, and very spectacular.

Iceland is a landscape photographers paradise and playground, and should be number 1 on every photographers must visit list. Iceland during the Midnight Sun is in sort of a permanent state of sunset. The sun never full sets and travels horizontally across the horizon throughout the night, as can be seen in the opening shot and at the :51 second mark in the video. 

During the Arctic summer, sunset was at midnight and sunrise was at 3am. The Arctic summer sun provided 24 hours a day of light, with as much as 6 hours daily of "Golden light". Once the sun had set it wouldn't even get dark enough for the stars to come out, and they don't start to reappear until August.

My advice to everyone out there, photographer or not, is simple... You MUST visit Iceland sometime during your lifetime. You will never regret it.

MiniLook Kiev


                    Created by Efim Graboy & Daria Turetski
Music: Adam Burns / Jez Burns - May Flowers

Наш блог: http://minilookkiev.blogspot.com/2012/03/minilook-kiev.html

Because of our sentiments to the city and the incoming spring, we bring you a miniature day in a life of Kiev.

The Making:
We shot MiniLook Kiev with Canon 550D, during 5 days and 2 nights, shoted over 25,000 frames,
from all of them we used about 4,500. The post-production was the hardest part of the creation, it took us a few good months, but finally it's done!

Watch in HD! Enjoy the Kiev!

Один миниатюрный день из жизни всеми любимого Киева.

Создание: 
Мы снимали MiniLook Kiev на Canon 550D, в течении 5 дней и 2х ночей. Всего было отснято более 25,000 фотографий, из которых в само видео было отобрано лишь 4,500. Самой тяжелой частью работы оказался пост-продакшн: несколько месяцев мы провели за экранами, отбирая фотографии и собирая их в единое целое видео.

Наслаждайтесь городом! Смотрите в HD!

The denomination 500 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

History[link]
Career[link]




The band playing live in 2008


Craig Reid and Charlie Reid were born in Leith in 1962, and grew up in Edinburgh, Cornwall and Auchtermuchty. When they stayed in Auchtermuchty they attended Bell Baxter High School. After several punk rock bands at school they formed The Proclaimers in 1983.
The pair came to public attention when an Inverness based fan sent their demo to the British band The Housemartins, who were impressed enough to invite The Proclaimers on their 1986 UK tour. The exposure of the tour won them a January 1987 appearance on the British pop music television programme The Tube on Channel Four;[1] "Letter from America" peaked at number 3 in the UK Singles Chart,[2] whilst the album This is the Story went gold. The follow-up album Sunshine on Leith featured "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" and "I'm On My Way".[2] They had a hit with their EP King of the Road, which reached number 9 in UK in 1990.
In March 2007 they recorded a new version of "I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" with television comedy characters Andy Pipkin (played by Matt Lucas) and Brian Potter (Peter Kay) for the Comic Relief charity. A long list of celebrities were featured in the music video for this new version, including David Bellamy, Rod, Jane and Freddy, Paul O'Grady, David Tennant, Frank Sidebottom and many more. This new version of the song reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart.[2]
The band was one of The B-52s' touring partners on their Funplex tour in Australia and New Zealand in November 2009, alongside Mental as Anything.
In addition, they featured in VH1's 100 greatest one hit wonders ("I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" having been their only US hit single).[3]
Influence[link]
The brothers are fans of Hibernian Football Club, and "Sunshine on Leith" has become a club anthem, being played at home matches for important fixtures, such as the Edinburgh derby versus Heart of Midlothian FC, the club's city rivals. Charlie and Craig Reid appeared at their Easter Road stadium for the 'Hands Off Hibs' campaign in 1990 when Wallace Mercer, a wealthly Edinburgh businessman with direct connections to Hearts FC, attempted a takeover of the club but was defeated by fan pressure.
They are also well-known supporters of Scottish independence and have at various stages of their lives been activists for the Scottish National Party, expressing such views during their promotional tour of Britain in March 2007.[4] However in April 2007 Charlie Reid announced that he had switched his allegiance to the Scottish Socialist Party in protest at the Scottish National Party's receipt of funding from big business.[5] Many of their songs reflect their political views, such as "Letter from America" and "Cap in Hand".
On 16 May 2006 the twins announced their participation in a campaign to free a fellow Scot, Kenny Richey, from his death row sentence in Ohio, including an appearance at a charity concert.[6] Also, in 2010 they participated with Billy Bragg in a show supporting Reprieve, charity that fights the death penalty. The Proclaimers also support other charities such as The Lighthouse Foundation (addiction victims), AICR (cancer research), Drake Music Scotland (help disabled people through music) or 500 miles (amputees or disabled people in Africa).

	                     Santa Maria - Penny-pinching by a band known for its onstage pyrotechnic displays may have cost more than 230 people their lives at a nightclub in southern Brazil, according to a police inspector leading the investigation into this weekend's deadly blaze. Inspector Marcelo Arigony told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday that members of the band knowingly purchased flares meant for outdoor use because they cost a mere $1.25 apiece, compared with the $35 price tag for an indoor flare. “The flare lit was for outdoor use only, and the people who lit them know that,” said Arigony, adding that...

Tragedia w Brazylii Santa Maria's / Brazil nightclub fire kills 245 people - Santa Maria's Tragedy


                    Brazil has declared three days of national mourning for 233 people killed in a nightclub fire in the southern city of Santa Maria. The fire reportedly started after a member of a band playing at the Kiss nightclub lit a flare on stage. Authorities say most of the victims were students who died of smoke inhalation. The first funerals are expected on Monday morning. It is the deadliest fire in Brazil in five decades. The BBC's Gary Duffy reports from Sao Paulo that the national sense of loss is profound. 'Dark, heavy smoke' The fire broke out as students from the city's federal university (UFSM) were holding a freshers' ball, the Diario de Santa Maria, a local newspaper, reported. A local journalist, Marcelo Gonzatto, told the BBC that the flare had "started a huge and fast fire that grew quickly and made a very dark and heavy smoke." Witnesses spoke of scenes of panic after the fire started, and a stampede as people tried to escape. One, Mattheus Bortolotto, told local television: "It was sheer horror. The emergency exits did not work, and then I lost my friend in the confusion. Then a girl died in my arms. I felt her heart stop beating." A large number of victims were trapped in the club's toilets, they said, possibly after mistaking them for an exit. Survivors and police inspector Marcelo Arigony said security guards briefly tried to block people from leaving the club, the Associated Press news agency reported.

PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil — Flames raced through a crowded nightclub in southern Brazil early Sunday, killing more than 230 people as panicked partygoers gasped for breath in the smoke-filled air, stampeding toward a single exit partially blocked by those already dead. It appeared to be the world's deadliest nightclub fire in more than a decade. Witnesses said a flare or firework lit by band members started the blaze in Santa Maria, a university city of about 225000 people, though officials said the cause was still under investigation. Television images showed smoke pouring out of the Kiss nightclub as shirtless young men who had attended a university party joined firefighters using axes and sledgehammers to pound at windows and walls to free those trapped inside. Guido Pedroso Melo, commander of the city's fire department, told the O Globo newspaper that firefighters had a hard time getting inside the club because "there was a barrier of bodies blocking the entrance." Teenagers sprinted from the scene desperately seeking help. Others carried injured and burned friends away in their arms. "There was so much smoke and fire, it was complete panic, and it took a long time for people to get out, there were so many dead," survivor Luana Santos Silva told the Globo TV network. The fire spread so fast inside the packed club that firefighters ...

Brazil Nightclub Fire Kills At Least 200 People


                    At least 200 people were killed in a nightclub fire in southern Brazil on Sunday after a band's pyrotechnics show set the establishment ablaze, local officials said. Bodies were still being removed from the Kiss nightclub in the southern city of Santa Maria, Major Gerson da Rosa Ferreira, who was leading rescue efforts at the scene for the military police, told Reuters. Ferreira said 159 bodies had been removed from the club, and the death toll was likely to rise above 200. He said the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled, and there were as many as 500 people inside the club when the fire broke out. Luiza Sousa, a civil police official in Santa Maria, told Reuters the blaze started when a member of the band or its production team ignited a flare, which then set fire to the ceiling. The fire spread "in seconds", Sousa said. Rio Grande do Sul state Health Secretary Ciro Simoni said respirators from all over the state were being sent to the scene. Santa Maria is some 187 miles west of the state capital of Porto Alegre. "A sad Sunday!" tweeted Rio Grande do Sul Governor Tarso Genro. He said "all possible measures" were being taken in response and that he was on his way to the scene.

Brazil Fire: Club Owner And Band Members Arrested


                    Brazilian police have arrested two members of a band that used ill-fated pyrotechnics during a performance at a student nightclub where 231 people died in a fire. The band, called Gurizada Fandangueira, was performing at the overcrowded Kiss club when the fire started early on Sunday morning in the southern city of Santa Maria. The nightclub's co-owner, Elissandro Spohr, was also detained by police over the blaze, Ms Sphor's lawyer told local media. Police have also issued an arrest warrant for another owner of the club. Inspector Ranolfo Vieira Junior said the arrests were for investigative purposes and that the trio can be held for up to five days. Police said they think the pyrotechnics used by the band ignited sound insulation on the ceiling, and witnesses said a flare or firework lit by the musicians started the blaze. In comments to the media, a band member has denied responsibility, while the club insisted in a statement that everything had been in order at the venue. One member of the band, the accordion player Danilo Jacques, 28, was among the dead. Mr Jacques had escaped the burning building, but he died when returned inside to save his accordion. The five other members of the band made it out safely. The band's guitarist Rodrigo Martins said: "[The fire] might have happened because of the Sputnik, the machine we use to create a luminous effect with sparks. It's harmless, we never had any trouble with it. "When the fire started, a guard passed us a fire ...

Brazil nightclub fire: Funerals set to take place


                    Following the devastating fire that left 231 people dead in a nightclub in the southern Brazilian town of Santa Maria, the country has declared a three day period of mourning for the victims, mainly students who were killed in the fire. This footage shown on a local TV station shows fire fighters at the Kiss night club, after a local band lit a flare which set the highly flammable ceiling sound proofing on fire. The flames spread quickly in the overcrowded nightclub. The clubbers believed to be up to 2000 strong, attempted to get out but were hampered by heavy smoke and toxic fumes. Here clubbers in a desperate act are hacking at the walls to try and release those trapped inside. And inside the Santa Maria gym hundreds of distraught family members and friend's gather to identify their loved ones. With funerals planned from today. This deadly nightclub fire is the worst in fifty years. And the tragedy, in one of the most prosperous states comes as the country scrambles to improve safety, security and logistical shortfalls before the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Brazil mourns nightclub fire dead


                    www.euronews.com In southern Brazil, relatives and friends of more than 200 young people killed in a nightclub fire have gathered in the city of Santa Maria to reclaim their bodies. They were taken to a community gymnasium for identification. Police said the band on stage set off a flare that ignited insulation material in the ceiling. It spread in seconds causing a scramble for a way out. The fire was at a party organised by students from the Federal University of Santa Maria. Professor Neri Paniss said: "Many of them were students from my university. They're not only going to be missed now at this moment of loss, but each day forward." Police have arrested one of the owners of the Kiss club and two members of the band. Reports in local media said the club's fire certificate expired last year.

Authorities said the fire broke out early Sunday at a club known as 'Kiss' and that while the cause of the blaze has not yet been confirmed, a flare or firework that was part of the band's pyrotechnic display is the likely cause. Witnesses reported that the fire broke out after band members lit flares. Many of the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled as panicked revelers pushed and shoved to escape the building. A recount lowered the toll from the 245 earlier believed to have been killed. The fire ranks among the deadliest ever in a nightclub, comparable to a blaze in China in 2000 in which 309 people died and one in 2004 in a Buenos Aires club in which 194 were killed. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says he is saddened to learn about the tragedy and is especially moved that so many young people and students were killed. He says he sends his condolences to their families. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff cut short a visit to Chile early Sunday to return home following the fire. Governor Tarso Genro of Rio Grande do Sul is quoted in a Twitter message as saying "all possible measures" were being taken. He and other officials ...

Brazil Nightclub Fire Kills At Least 245 People [RAW]


                    A blaze raced through a crowded nightclub in southern Brazil early Sunday, killing 232 people as the air filled with deadly smoke and panicked party-goers stampeded toward the exits, police and witnesses said. It appeared to be the world's deadliest nightclub fire in more than a decade. Witnesses said that a flare or firework lit by band members may have started the fire. Police Maj. Cleberson Braida Bastianello said by telephone that officials counted 232 bodies that had been brought for identification to a gymnasium in the city of Santa Maria, at the southern tip of Brazil near the borders with Argentina and Uruguay. Bastianello said the that lowered the toll from 245 earlier believed killed. Television images showed smoke pouring out of the Kiss nightclub as shirtless, young male partygoers joined firefighters in wielding axes and sledgehammers, pounding at windows and walls to break through to those trapped inside. Teenagers sprinted from the scene desperately trying to find help. Others carried injured and burned friends away in their arms. "There was so much smoke and fire, it was complete panic and it took a long time for people to get out, there were so many dead," survivor Luana Santos Silva told the Globo TV network. Silva added that firefighters and ambulances responded quickly after the fire broke out, but that it spread too fast inside the packed club for them to help.

Brazil has declared three days of national mourning for 233 people killed in a nightclub fire in the southern city of Santa Maria. The fire reportedly started after a member of a band playing at the Kiss nightclub lit a flare on stage. Authorities say most of the victims were students who died of smoke inhalation. The first funerals are expected on Monday morning. It is the deadliest fire in Brazil in five decades. The BBC's Gary Duffy reports from Sao Paulo that the national sense of loss is profound. 'Dark, heavy smoke' The fire broke out as students from the city's federal university (UFSM) were holding a freshers' ball, the Diario de Santa Maria, a local newspaper, reported. A local journalist, Marcelo Gonzatto, told the BBC that the flare had "started a huge and fast fire that grew quickly and made a very dark and heavy smoke." Witnesses spoke of scenes of panic after the fire started, and a stampede as people tried to escape. One, Mattheus Bortolotto, told local television: "It was sheer horror. The emergency exits did not work, and then I lost my friend in the confusion. Then a girl died in my arms. I felt her heart stop beating." A large number of victims were trapped in the club's toilets, they said, possibly after mistaking them for an exit. Survivors and police inspector Marcelo Arigony said security guards briefly tried to block people from leaving the club, the Associated Press news agency reported.

PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil — Flames raced through a crowded nightclub in southern Brazil early Sunday, killing more than 230 people as panicked partygoers gasped for breath in the smoke-filled air, stampeding toward a single exit partially blocked by those already dead. It appeared to be the world's deadliest nightclub fire in more than a decade. Witnesses said a flare or firework lit by band members started the blaze in Santa Maria, a university city of about 225000 people, though officials said the cause was still under investigation. Television images showed smoke pouring out of the Kiss nightclub as shirtless young men who had attended a university party joined firefighters using axes and sledgehammers to pound at windows and walls to free those trapped inside. Guido Pedroso Melo, commander of the city's fire department, told the O Globo newspaper that firefighters had a hard time getting inside the club because "there was a barrier of bodies blocking the entrance." Teenagers sprinted from the scene desperately seeking help. Others carried injured and burned friends away in their arms.

'Dark, heavy smoke' The fire broke out as students from the city's federal university (UFSM) were holding a freshers' ball, the Diario de Santa Maria, a local newspaper, reported. A local journalist, Marcelo Gonzatto, told the BBC that the flare had "started a huge and fast fire that grew quickly and made a very dark and heavy smoke." Witnesses spoke of scenes of panic after the fire started, and a stampede as people tried to escape. One, Mattheus Bortolotto, told local television: "It was sheer horror. The emergency exits did not work, and then I lost my friend in the confusion. Then a girl died in my arms. I felt her heart stop beating." A large number of victims were trapped in the club's toilets, they said, possibly after mistaking them for an exit. Survivors and police inspector Marcelo Arigony said security guards briefly tried to block people from leaving the club, the Associated Press news agency reported. Bars in Brazil commonly make customers pay their whole tab ...

At least 200 people were killed in a nightclub fire in southern Brazil on Sunday after a band's pyrotechnics show set the establishment ablaze, local officials said. Bodies were still being removed from the Kiss nightclub in the southern city of Santa Maria, Major Gerson da Rosa Ferreira, who was leading rescue efforts at the scene for the military police, told Reuters. Ferreira said 159 bodies had been removed from the club, and the death toll was likely to rise above 200. He said the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled, and there were as many as 500 people inside the club when the fire broke out. Luiza Sousa, a civil police official in Santa Maria, told Reuters the blaze started when a member of the band or its production team ignited a flare, which then set fire to the ceiling. The fire spread "in seconds", Sousa said. Rio Grande do Sul state Health Secretary Ciro Simoni said respirators from all over the state were being sent to the scene. Santa Maria is some 187 miles west of the state capital of Porto Alegre. "A sad Sunday!" tweeted Rio Grande do Sul Governor Tarso Genro. He said "all possible measures" were being taken in response and that he was on his way to the scene.

Brazilian police have arrested two members of a band that used ill-fated pyrotechnics during a performance at a student nightclub where 231 people died in a fire. The band, called Gurizada Fandangueira, was performing at the overcrowded Kiss club when the fire started early on Sunday morning in the southern city of Santa Maria. The nightclub's co-owner, Elissandro Spohr, was also detained by police over the blaze, Ms Sphor's lawyer told local media. Police have also issued an arrest warrant for another owner of the club. Inspector Ranolfo Vieira Junior said the arrests were for investigative purposes and that the trio can be held for up to five days. Police said they think the pyrotechnics used by the band ignited sound insulation on the ceiling, and witnesses said a flare or firework lit by the musicians started the blaze. In comments to the media, a band member has denied responsibility, while the club insisted in a statement that everything had been in order at the venue. One member of the band, the accordion player Danilo Jacques, 28, was among the dead. Mr Jacques had escaped the burning building, but he died when returned inside to save his accordion. The five other members of the band made it out safely. The band's guitarist Rodrigo Martins said: "[The fire] might have happened because of the Sputnik, the machine we use to create a luminous effect with sparks. It's harmless, we never had any trouble with it. "When the fire started, a guard passed us a fire ...

Following the devastating fire that left 231 people dead in a nightclub in the southern Brazilian town of Santa Maria, the country has declared a three day period of mourning for the victims, mainly students who were killed in the fire. This footage shown on a local TV station shows fire fighters at the Kiss night club, after a local band lit a flare which set the highly flammable ceiling sound proofing on fire. The flames spread quickly in the overcrowded nightclub. The clubbers believed to be up to 2000 strong, attempted to get out but were hampered by heavy smoke and toxic fumes. Here clubbers in a desperate act are hacking at the walls to try and release those trapped inside. And inside the Santa Maria gym hundreds of distraught family members and friend's gather to identify their loved ones. With funerals planned from today. This deadly nightclub fire is the worst in fifty years. And the tragedy, in one of the most prosperous states comes as the country scrambles to improve safety, security and logistical shortfalls before the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Please SUBSCRIBE for the Best Breaking NEWS !! 230 people killed in Nightclub inferno | Breaking Nightclub fire claims the lives of 230 people Brazilian officials say 232 people are dead and more than 100 injured after a fire swept through a nightclub crowded with university students in the southern city of Santa Maria. Authorities said the fire broke out early Sunday at a club known as 'Kiss' and that while the cause of the blaze has not yet been confirmed, a flare or firework that was part of the band's pyrotechnic display is the likely cause. Witnesses reported that the fire broke out after band members lit flares. Many of the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled as panicked revelers pushed and shoved to escape the building. A recount lowered the toll from the 245 earlier believed to have been killed. The fire ranks among the deadliest ever in a nightclub, comparable to a blaze in China in 2000 in which 309 people died and one in 2004 in a Buenos Aires club in which 194 were killed. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says he is saddened to learn about the tragedy and is especially moved that so many young people and students were killed. He says he sends his condolences to their families. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff cut short a visit to Chile early Sunday to return home following the fire.

A blaze raced through a crowded nightclub in southern Brazil early Sunday, killing 232 people as the air filled with deadly smoke and panicked party-goers stampeded toward the exits, police and witnesses said. It appeared to be the world's deadliest nightclub fire in more than a decade. Witnesses said that a flare or firework lit by band members may have started the fire. Police Maj. Cleberson Braida Bastianello said by telephone that officials counted 232 bodies that had been brought for identification to a gymnasium in the city of Santa Maria, at the southern tip of Brazil near the borders with Argentina and Uruguay. Bastianello said the that lowered the toll from 245 earlier believed killed. Television images showed smoke pouring out of the Kiss nightclub as shirtless, young male partygoers joined firefighters in wielding axes and sledgehammers, pounding at windows and walls to break through to those trapped inside. Teenagers sprinted from the scene desperately trying to find help. Others carried injured and burned friends away in their arms. "There was so much smoke and fire, it was complete panic and it took a long time for people to get out, there were so many dead," survivor Luana Santos Silva told the Globo TV network. Silva added that firefighters and ambulances responded quickly after the fire broke out, but that it spread too fast inside the packed club for them to help.

Updated at 7:30 pm ET: At least 232 people were killed after a band's fireworks show sparked a rapidly moving fire in a packed nightclub in southern Brazil and fleeing patrons were unable to find their way out, local police said. The bodies removed from the Kiss nightclub in the southern city of Santa Maria were taken to a gymnasium for identification, police said. Major Gerson da Rosa Ferreira, who led rescue efforts at the scene for the military police, told Reuters that the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled. In addition to the number of deaths, more than 100 people were injured, police said, and most remain hospitalized. Fire brigade colonel Guido Pedroso de Melo told O Globo newspaper that rescuers had difficulty entering the premises because of "a barrier of bodies" at the entrance to the club. Police officials had earlier reported that 245 people were killed. The death toll could still rise, police said later, from the people who are injured. Television footage monitored by Reuters overnight showed people crying outside the club as shirtless firefighters used sledge hammers and axes to knock down an exterior wall to open up an exit. Rodrigo Moura, who the newspaper Diario de Santa Maria identified as a security guard at the club, said it was at its capacity of between 1000 and 2000 people and patrons were pushing and shoving to escape, the AP reported.

www.euronews.com Police in Brazil say the nightclub fire that killed 235 people was caused by cheap fireworks meant for outdoor use. As people in Santa Maria again marched demanding justice for the victims, the chief investigator has backed witness accounts suggesting the band on stage had let off flares. "The people who bought this material knew it was for external use and not to be used indoors but they used it because it was cheaper," said police inspector Marcelo Arigony. He said that whereas indoor fireworks cost 70 reales (25 euros), the band chose cheaper ones from a local shop that only cost 12.5 reales (under 5 euros). The inspector, who lost a cousin in the disaster, said the fireworks were part of the band's show and they had even worn gloves on stage. A band member is among several people who have been arrested. Video filmed on Tuesday shows the damage to the Kiss nightclub from Sunday's fire. Soot covers the doors and debris is strewn across the floor. The authorities also say the venue had too many people, combustible material in the ceiling, and faulty fire safety equipment. The country's health minister said the lives of dozens being treated in hospital were in danger. Several other towns in Brazil have announced stricter controls on clubs.

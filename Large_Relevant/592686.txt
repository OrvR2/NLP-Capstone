Why should normal people who are both amused and kinda grossed-out by the grotty idea of a dude stuffing his cock in another dudes hairy arse not be aloud to laugh, make fun of, or state their distaste??
Free world bitch!
Sure, you're aloud to do it, and you should be aloud to get married if you want - hell, stick you cock in a goat too if that's your thing. Just don't tell the rest of us we can't have an opinion on it. 
A straight guy should not be forced to share a shower with a fag. Fuck you.

Love it - one of the most passionate versions on that tour - sometimes he just appears to be going thru the motions when performing this song, like it's a contractual requirement - but damn, here he's feeling it!!  Nothing beats this song when he's playing it with true passion!...
Captured beautifully (if only there was a soundboard audio to put on it)...

Amen, he's a legend.
Wish he had the same staright out musical passion now as he had back in the pre-JW/slave days - those 1st15 years were phenomenal. Better than anything anybody's doing now, or then.
As good as anybody, anytime!

She's been around for ages dude, she's released about a dozen albums.
Do yourself a favour and track down Beth Hart Live In Paradiso 2005 dvd (lots of clips on youtube). Unrestrained and on fire. 
This clip doesn't even hint at how outstanding she is live. She's done numerous more passionate versions of this very song. Let youtube be your friend

NK's weapons are but a regional concern, but I bet a decent number of murekan patriots would love telling their grandkids of how they "won" a war against commies.
The people need to be freed, not teached a lesson not to mess with murrekka.
But much like the foreign policy on just about everything else our dear friend U.S. of A is still failing special ed.

Insanity is pledged in so many cases just to get lesser time. It's debatable if anyone committing murder is completely sane at all, but the big question is whether insanity is a constant or can actually be "temporary". I personally believe she was faking it and should serve the time as if sane.

5daysagoPolice: Brazil nightclub fire kills at least 233A fire broke out early Sunday morning at a night club in Santa Maria, in southern Brazil, killing revelers — many of them students. NBC's Mike Taibbi reports. By Jeff Black, Staff Writer, NBC NewsUpdated at 1:23 a.m. ET: At least 233 people were killed after a band’s fireworks show sparked a rapidly moving fire in a packed nightclub in southern Brazil and fleeing patrons were unable to find their way out, local police said.Follow @NBCNewsWorld
 The bodies removed from the Kiss nightclub in the southern city of Santa Maria were taken to the Municipal Sports Center gymnasium for identification, police said.Major Gerson da Rosa Ferreira, who led rescue efforts at the scene for the military police, told Reuters that the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled. Police Maj. Cleberson Braida Bastianello told the Associated Press by telephone that the toll had risen to 233 with the death of a hospitalized victim.

Officials earlier counted 232 bodies that had been brought to the gymnasium in Santa Maria.In addition to the number of deaths, more  than 100 people were injured, police said, and most remain hospitalized. Police officials had reported earlier in the day that 245 people were  killed. The  death toll could still rise, police said later, from the  people who are  injured.Fire brigade colonel Guido Pedroso de Melo told O Globo newspaper that rescuers had difficulty entering the premises because of "a barrier of bodies" at  the entrance to the club.Television footage monitored by Reuters overnight showed people crying outside the club as shirtless firefighters used sledge hammers and axes to knock down an exterior wall to open up an exit. Agencia RBS via APPeople help a man injured in a nightclub fire in Santa Maria city, Brazil, on Sunday.Rodrigo Moura, who the newspaper Diario de Santa Maria identified as a security guard at the club, said it was at its capacity of between 1,000 and 2,000 people and patrons were pushing and shoving to escape, the AP reported. Police estimated the crowd at some 900 revelers.Fire officials said at least one exit was locked and that club bouncers, who at  first thought those fleeing were trying to skip out on bar tabs, initially  blocked patrons from leaving, Reuters reported.The club's management said in a statement it would help authorities with their investigation, Reuters reported.One of the club's owners has surrendered to police for questioning, GloboNews TV reported. "It was really fast. There was a lot of smoke, really dark smoke," survivor Aline Santos Silva, 29, told Globonews TV. "We were only able to get out quickly because we were in a VIP area close to the door." President Dilma Rousseff cut short a visit to Chile and visited families of the victims at the Municipal Sports Center, where relatives were gathering to identify the bodies. She met with relatives of the injured at Hospital de Caridade de Santa Maria.Rousseff declared a national three-day mourning period for victims of the fire. “Sad Sunday!” Tarso Genro, the governor of Rio Grande do Sul state where the club is located, tweeted. “We are taking all of the possible and appropriate actions,” the tweet read, according to a rough translation by NBC News. “I will be in Santa Maria later this morning.”The precise cause of the fire was still under investigation, authorities said. But Luiza Sousa, a civil police official in Santa Maria, told Reuters that the blaze started when someone with the band ignited what was described as a flare, which then set fire to the ceiling. The fire spread "in seconds," Sousa said. The tragedy in Brazil recalled other nightclub disaster. A fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in 2003 killed 100 people after pyrotechnics used on stage by the rock band Great White set ablaze foam used for soundproofing on the walls. A Buenos Aires nightclub blaze in 2004 killed nearly 200 people. Reuters noted that Brazil's safety standards and emergency response capabilities are under particular scrutiny as the country prepares to host the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Brazilian state’s Health secretary, Ciro Simoni, told the news service that emergency medical supplies from all over the state were being sent to the scene. Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore related topics: brazil, fire, nightclub, featured

McLisamcThis story keeps repeating.  No fireworks indoors!  Duh!
#197 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:38 PM ESTFed -2094313No its not your right to watch fire work. The fact is Sh** happens make all the laws  its going to happen. So just pass another law and take more of your freedomes away so we can feel better. You won't have to pry them from my cold dead hands. The only thing is that you have to do
is pry those liberals from my dead body#198 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:39 PM ESTLarry-nc-2418660This should make you all see the dire consequences of deregulations  spouted by Republicans.
Be thankful that you live in America.
When it's all about making money, businesses won't give a d a m n about your safety.#199 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:40 PM ESTDixie NormissIve been to around 20 other countries and Brazil is the most beautiful place on Earth imo. I dont personally know anyone in Santa Maria but my condolences to the familys of those lost. Ive been to Brazil 5 times in last 7 years and when Im there I feel more free then in my own country of America. Its just getting worse here in America and it makes me sad they are slowly giving away our freedoms one at a time using the peoples ignorance and fear. Its a horrible tragedy you face but don't change a thing Brazil you are a wonderful place and people!  Até breve!1 vote#200 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:42 PM ESTsawman62To all the fools that keep referring to Brazil as a 3rd World country. Exactly what do you base that opinion on? Most have never been there, and if so have nothing to compare it to. What do you therefore consider 85% of Africa, Iraq, Afghanistan, Mexico,etc. The list goes on and you have been to none of them. Try visiting large swaths of Chicago, Atlanta, St.Louis, Detroit/Dearborn, NY City, LA, New Orleans, even Washington D.C. and that's about as 3rd world or worse than Brazil. Thanks to our Democrats and the idiots that keep electing them, we can look forward to more 3rd world right here in America.#201 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:42 PM ESTFed -2094313name one you clown#202 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:44 PM ESTPhill A. SheeoI'm really sorry to hear this.  Thats ALOT of deaths.  Wow.#203 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:44 PM ESTLarry-nc-2418660People are always shocked when tragedies like this happen yet some of you complain about regulating business for your safety.
Well, when planes just suddenly start falling from the sky on a monthly basis (like in Russia, a plutocracy), you may get the message.#204 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:49 PM ESTFed -2094313the last post was for Larry. And yes it is sad what happened. But its always going to happenen thats my point.#205 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:50 PM ESTKen GilleoThis is insanity. Almost a repeat of the Station Fire tragedy in Rhode Island, USA a few years ago where 100 people ultimately died. Cause of fire? Fireworks on stage! Why do we ignore the "fire" part of fireworks?#206 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:55 PM ESTjaybo1If it was a nightclub there was probably a lot of olcohol consumed which probably helped cause so many lives to be lost.#207 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:57 PM ESTxsvenomWow that really sucks. Seems like that club might not have been too safe to party at. I feel sorry for the families that lost loved ones. #208 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:59 PM ESTGmandeseI watched this all unfolding here, in Campinas, yes, an American living here near Sao Paulo.
One thing that was constantly being mentioned during the coverage, is that the security wouldn't allow the people to flee, the doors were locked, in order to force them to pay their tabs. Yes! Many died for money. Now, I have been to clubs here, and believe me, if there were a way for someone to sneak out without paying, sometimes hundreds of $$$, they would find it. So, clubs routinely lock the exits, so the ONLY way to leave, is by one small exit door, AFTER you show proof you paid your bill. That is the way it works here, you order what you want for the whole night, and in the end each person gets the "command" (bill) for what they consumed, and you can't pass the gauntlet to get out until its paid, stamped, inspected, and you are released.
In this case, at least as being reported up to now, (and nothing mentioned in the USA or international stories about this point), is that the evacuation was basically non-existant, and this accounts for all the bodies stacked at the exits....The doors were locked.#209 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 3:59 PM ESTFed -2094313What do you mean when plains start falling out of the skys? But yet you get in your car every day and feel good about it. Get real.#210 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 4:01 PM EST

abby-1588585To the people of Brazil, especially those who have lost loved ones in this horrific fire, our hearts and prayers are with you.
God's peace.#211 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 4:06 PM ESTjohn@1you smell that?? i smell money!! (law suits!)#212 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 4:06 PM ESTGordon Nelson-4084835I went to Rammstein in Veagas , amazing music  and amazing show. But I shutter to think back now if something would of gone wrong then, it would of been 20 fold in lost lives. I also saw the Rolling Stones with no pyro , and it was equally amazing music and show . If a band wants to use fire, "do it in your own video " don't involve inocent people in uncontrolable circumstances. Even Michael Jacson got burned making his own video . It's cool but unforgivingly pointless.  #213 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 4:10 PM ESTWorkyI visited Rio recently and found that the hotels do not have fire escapes. The elevators are in the center of the building and make excellent chimneys for a fire. If there is a fire, you either jump out the window to your death or die from the smoke. Advice to travelers is to stay in the smaller motel types on the ground floor.#214 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 4:16 PM ESTdeer from NewYorkI am displeased with the haphazardness of not being vigilant and may even not cognizant in fire safety measures. In such a severe case as this event when fireworks are used there definitely should be extensively ventilated areas . As such a condition of an engagement  as a night club, especially, one whose capacity appeals to  the majority of the state of Santa Maria. In the issue of fire and fire safety here in Santa Maria arise an irrevokable miscue that can never be forgotten or forgiven. It is the negligence;intentionally, but reckless behavior of not only the owners as otherwise the freelancers that went there to amuse themselves. Thankyou.#215 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 4:20 PM ESTTKA-12Over two hundred people and only one exit  ???? , that's criminal , that's murder !! ,, I hope that the owners bear the full weight of the law of that country ,,because similar cases have occurred in other countries so this should not happen Nowhere in the world ,,, it's time they the night club owners learn night clubs with few emergency exit are death traps for people ...#216 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 4:23 PM ESTBatman of GothamOnce again, just by reading comments here is living proof that this world is full of ignorant children posing as adults. Oh wait, you are adults..................Now I know why the world is F_cked up !!!!!!!!Ok enough talk about you IDIOTS. For the very few normal compassionate people here, I as a Musician in a Rock Band also send my condolences out to the families of the deceased. No live act, musical or theatrical ever plans such a tragic event to transpire. Yes accidents do happen and people sometimes die but nothing is ever planned. And Governments have nothing to do with it you other childish MORONS !!!!!!!!!!2 votes#217 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 4:31 PM ESTwallacet1947Accidents don't just happen.  People cause accidents by careslessness and disregard for safety and common sense.  Now we know by listening to you how accidents "just happen dude."  Let us know when you play so we can stay away...you might electrocute yourself and some of us.#217.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 6:02 PM ESTshortandlittleIts so hard to see how mean people are being, and you are absolutly right! These are adults.#217.2 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 6:49 PM ESTaldiggy2000The fire sealed the deal but I think it was the smoke that killed them. Knocked them out#218 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 4:38 PM ESThossridr-779603Money + corruption = Greed.  They learned that from us Americans. Anyone ever see the MSNBC program American Greed? If there is any doubt in anyones mind what I'm saying here, just watch that program.  All true stories. #219 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 4:41 PM ESTrunningpaul82what an idiotic comment. greed isn't unique to americans dumbass.#219.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 5:52 PM ESThossridr-779603Did I say unique? I said that they LEARNED that from Americans. Learn to READ buffoon. #219.2 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 6:04 PM ESTNick-NastyI agree dumb comment. I "READ" quite well and to think anyone "LEARNED" greed from Americans is dumb.#219.3 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 6:20 PM ESTMarie-1056206God bless those people who died and their families who have to carry on without them.1 vote#220 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 4:47 PM ESTmike dobeyI wonder if this was a kiss tribute band? or just  club called kiss. this is very sad and I remember the terrible great white fire of 2003 which claimed 98 people.  in the 1940's we had a even worse fire at the coconut grove in boston. #221 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 4:48 PM ESTJump to discussion page: 1 ...  6 7 8 9 10 ...  14Leave a Comment:Name: Email Address (will be verified, but never shown): You're in Easy Mode.

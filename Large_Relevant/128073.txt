Blog Posts by Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsFormer first dog Barney Bush diesBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – 8 hrs agoTweet0

Former first dog Barney Bush, the black Scottish terrier who romped on the White House grounds in George W. Bush’s time there, has died at age 12, the former president said in a statement. The playful pooch had been suffering from lymphoma.
Barney played a starring role in the presidential mansion, notably in “BarneyCam” holiday specials featuring footage from a camera that caught a dog’s eye view of senior aides like Karl Rove. He was also a reliable fixture on the White House website.
Bush announced his dog's passing in a statement:
Laura and I are sad to announce that our Scottish Terrier, Barney, has passed away. The little fellow had been suffering from lymphoma and after twelve and a half years of life, his body could not fight off the illness.
Barney and I enjoyed the outdoors. He loved to accompany me when I fished for bass at the ranch. He was a fierce armadillo hunter. At Camp David, his favorite activity was chasing golf balls on the chipping green.

Energy Secretary Chu steps down, blasts climate-change skepticsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – 13 hrs agoTweet0
Secretary of Energy Steven Chu in 2011 (Larry Downing/Reuters)Energy Secretary Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist frequently the target of Republican criticism, announced Friday that he was stepping down in the latest shake-up of President Barack Obama's Cabinet. Chu, who disclosed his decision in a letter to Energy Department staff, frequently clashed with GOP lawmakers over gas prices as well as government backing for green-energy companies like the failed firm Solyndra.
In his letter, Chu took aim directly at his critics, saying the clean-energy efforts were a success—and blasted climate-change skeptics as trapped in "the Stone Age."
"While critics try hard to discredit the program, the truth is that only one percent of the companies we funded went bankrupt," he wrote. "That one percent has gotten more attention than the 99 percent that have not."
Chu added: "The test for America’s policy makers will be whether they are willing to accept a few failures in exchange for many successes. America’s entrepreneurs and innovators who are leaders in the global clean energy race understand that not every risk can—or should—be avoided. Michelangelo said, 'The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.'"
He also scolded climate-change skeptics and urged a shift from fossil-fuels to other sources of energy.

Hagel pummeled by McCain, others as opposition mountsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Jan 31, 2013Tweet0
Defense secretary nominee Chuck Hagel endured a thorough pounding on Thursday at the hands of his fellow Republicans during a contentious, daylong confirmation hearing that did nothing to improve his prospects for heading the Pentagon. But in a Senate where Democrats control four more votes than the 51 needed to approve him, it may not matter.
Hagel, a decorated Vietnam veteran, sometimes stumbled over predictable questions about his past opposition to unilateral sanctions on Iran, and his condemnation of what he once called the "Jewish lobby" and its influence on American-Israeli ties. Throughout the day, Republicans waged an electronic anti-Hagel campaign, emailing reporters quotes like, "There are a lot of things I don’t know about. If confirmed, I intend to know a lot more than I do. I will have to." There appeared to be no parallel pro-Hagel effort by President Barack Obama's administration.
Prodded on the former Nebraska senator's often shaky performance, White House press secretary Jay Carney criticized Republicans for "political posturing" and predicted Hagel  would be confirmed—but studiously avoided saying what Obama thought of the hearing or if he even watched it.
"I was with him for some time earlier today, not around a television, so I can't—I can say that during that period, he did not. But I can't say that definitively that he hasn’t seen any of it. As you know, he doesn't spend a lot of time watching TV," Carney said. "The president is absolutely confident that Sen. Hagel will, as I said, make an excellent secretary of defense."
The Senate confirms Cabinet secretaries by simple majority. But 60 votes are needed if Republicans opt to throw up procedural roadblocks to delay—or kill—the nomination. Democrats, with their independent allies, have a 55-45 advantage in the Senate. To date, the only Republican to come out publicly as a “yes” vote has been Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi.
The day's most charged exchanges included an angry assault by Republican Sen. John McCain, a dramatic turn given that Hagel co-chaired the senator's 2000 presidential campaign.
McCain derided Hagel as stubbornly camped “on the wrong side” of history when it comes to Iraq and openly doubted whether he could support the confirmation of his former comrade.

White House blames Sandy, spending cuts as economy shrinksBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Jan 30, 2013Tweet0
President Barack Obama speaks about immigration reform Tuesday in Las Vegas. (Isaac Brekken/AP)The White House on Wednesday blamed the devastation from Superstorm Sandy and disruptions from deep scheduled spending cuts for the surprise 0.1 percent drop in gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2012. It was the first such contraction since early 2009 when the country was in the grips of the Great Recession.
The chairman of President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, Alan Krueger, said in a post on the official White House blog that the bad news came “amid signs that Hurricane Sandy disrupted economic activity and Federal defense spending declined precipitously, likely due to uncertainty stemming from the sequester.”
That law will slash some $1.2 trillion in spending over 10 years by targeting domestic and defense programs with across-the-board cuts. Obama and Republicans in Congress have been starkly at odds over how best to replace the sequester with less disruptive debt-battling measures. The president has said spending cuts must be paired with tax revenue increases, something Republicans oppose.
Meanwhile, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell renewed the GOP’s calls for spending cuts on the Senate floor on Wednesday, urging a look into “the dark corners that often evade real scrutiny” on a mission to make government programs more efficient and scrap those that don’t work.
“We need to root out waste, which will serve as the first real test of Democrats’ seriousness in this debate,” he said.

AFL-CIO chief vows ‘full-fledged campaign’ for immigration overhaulBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Jan 29, 2013Tweet0
AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka (Carolyn Kaster/AP)Organized labor is “entirely behind” comprehensive immigration reform and will mount a “full-fledged” campaign to help drive it through Congress, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Yahoo News on Tuesday.
Trumka, whose federation comprises 57 unions representing some 12 million people, called the planned overhaul “one of our top priorities right now.” He spoke by telephone from Las Vegas, Nev., where he was to attend President Barack Obama’s speech on immigration reform.
“We think everybody ought to have the right to work hard and to progress to citizenship,” Trumka said.
White House officials cite robust support from organized labor—which at times in recent history has opposed giving the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants on U.S. soil a path to citizenship—as a key factor in their optimism about getting a comprehensive bill through Congress. They also point to the expansion of support among Christians, notably evangelicals. And they joke that the difficulty of managing a broad coalition is the kind of problem they like having.
Unions “did have at one point some differences” on the issue, but “the entire labor movement is entirely behind this now,” Trumka said. “We’ll be at the table the whole time this thing is being developed to make sure it meets the needs of workers.” Once it’s drafted, he continued, “we’ll be pushing this thing [with a] full-fledged campaign” aimed at both public opinion and wary lawmakers.

Obama announces new aid for Syrian rebelsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Jan 29, 2013Tweet0

Under fire for not doing more to help Syria’s rebels, President Barack Obama announced on Tuesday that he's sending opponents of strongman Bashar al-Assad another $155 million in humanitarian aid and defended his handling of the bloody conflict. Obama said the aid sends a message to the world.
“The relief we send doesn’t say ‘Made in America,’ but make no mistake—our aid reflects the commitment of the American people,” he said in a video posted on the White House website. The message includes Arabic subtitles.
Obama, who faces chiefly Republican criticism for not offering the rebels American weapons or taking other steps to beat back Assad’s armed forces, said the money would help Syrians under fire and those who have fled to neighboring countries.
“I want to speak directly to the people of Syria,” he said in the video. “This new aid will mean more warm clothing for children and medicine for the elderly; flour and wheat for your families and blankets, boots and stoves for those huddled in damaged buildings.
“It will mean health care for victims of sexual violence and field hospitals for the wounded,” he continued. “Even as we work to end the violence against you, this aid will help address some of the immediate needs you face each day."
The new aid will bring total U.S. assistance to Syrian rebels to $365 million.

Obama vs the fly. Call it a draw?By Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Jan 24, 2013Tweet0
A fly lands on President Barack Obama while he speaks in the White House (Larry Downing/Reuters)Three days into President Barack Obama's second term and it's clear he's not the man he was in his first term. Just ask the fly.
A pesky Musca domestica (per pooler Brian Beutler of Talking Points Memo) landed on the president's face during a press conference Thursday to announce his picks to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Obama swatted at the fly a couple of times, and the official White House transcript records, "This guy is bothering me here—(swatting at a fly.)"
The insect eventually left the commander in chief alone.
But the Obama of just a few years ago—of June 2009, to be precise—might not be impressed. That's because that Obama successfully killed a fly during an interview with CNBC, boasting, "I got the sucker."

Biden on self-defense: Get yourself a shotgunBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Jan 24, 2013Tweet0
Vice President Joe Biden arrives during the second presidential inauguration of Barack Obama at the U.S. Capitol (Win McNamee/Reuters)Are you looking into buying an assault weapon for protection after a devastating natural disaster (or the coming Zombie Apocalypse) plunges society into deadly anarchy? You’ve got it all wrong, Vice President Joe Biden said Thursday: Get yourself a shotgun.
Biden, doing a Google+ “hangout” to promote President Barack Obama’s proposals for battling gun violence, had been asked whether a new assault weapons ban might infringe on the Second Amendment rights of those who want one “as a last line of defense” to fend off looters after “some terrible natural disaster.”
“Guess what? A shotgun will keep you a lot safer, a double-barreled shotgun, than the assault weapon in somebody’s hands [who] doesn’t know how to use it, even one who does know how to use it,” the outspoken vice president, a shotgun owner himself, replied. “It’s harder to use an assault weapon to hit something than it is a shotgun. You want to keep people away in an earthquake? Buy some shotgun shells.”
With the fate of Obama’s gun violence proposals unclear in the face of stiff opposition from most Republicans and some Democrats, Biden urged supporters of ideas like imposing a new assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition clips to 10 rounds and toughening background checks to pressure their elected representatives. “This town listens when people rise up and speak,” Biden said.

Obama ‘would object’ to annihilation of Republican PartyBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Jan 24, 2013Tweet0
President Barack Obama talks with Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, at the conclusion of the Inaugural luncheon at the U.S. Capitol. (Benjamin Myers/Reuters)Um, bipartisanship? President Barack Obama “would object” to the annihilation of the Republican Party, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Thursday. His comments came two days after Republican House Speaker John Boehner charged that doing away with the GOP would be one of the Democrat’s top second-term priorities.
“I know it’s not his goal. His goal is to work together with Congress, with members of both parties to achieve progress on behalf of the American people,” Carney said.
But Obama would not object if somehow the GOP were destroyed, right?
“I think he would object,” Carney insisted. “He believes that the two-party system is part of the foundation of our democracy and that it is a healthy aspect of our democracy even if it’s contentious.”
Boehner leveled the accusation in a speech Tuesday to the Ripon Society, which describes itself as “a Republican public policy advocacy organization,” as he reflected on the president’s inaugural address.
“Given what we heard yesterday about the president’s vision for his second term, it’s pretty clear to me that he knows he can’t do any of that as long as the House is controlled by Republicans,” Boehner said. “So we’re expecting over the next 22 months to be the focus of this administration as they attempt to annihilate the Republican Party. And let me just tell you, I do believe that is their goal—to just shove us into the dustbin of history.”

Obama picks tough SEC nominee, renominates consumer watchdogBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Jan 24, 2013Tweet0
Mary Jo White, former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, appearing on Capitol Hill in 2002 (Dennis Cook/AP)President Barack Obama announced Thursday that he has picked career white-collar crime prosecutor Mary Jo White to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, which polices financial markets. And Obama set up a fight with Senate Republicans by renominating Richard Cordray to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which they oppose.
Obama noted that he pushed a sweeping overhaul of Wall Street rules through Congress in 2010, but underlined: "It’s not enough to change the law. We also need cops on the beat to enforce the law."
He added: "These are people with proven track records. They are going to look out for the American people, for American consumers, and make sure that our marketplace works better—more transparently, more efficiently, more effectively. So I again would urge the Senate to confirm both of them as quickly as possible."
The Senate GOP blocked Cordray’s nomination in 2011 as part of an effort to water down the CFPB’s powers, calling the bureau unaccountable and warning it could trammel legitimate businesses. That led Obama to use his presidential power to appoint him to the post during a Senate recess, bypassing lawmakers.
The nominations could set up new confirmation battles at the dawn of his second term. Some Republican senators have signaled that they will oppose his choice for defense secretary, Republican Chuck Hagel, a former senator.
(The president’s liberal critics have frequently complained that his administration never prosecuted major Wall Street figures over shady business practices thought to have fueled the 2007-2008 global financial meltdown.)

The steadily moronic, humanoid look and sound of the modern-day bearer of news, whether it's a fashion show or a human tragedy of this magnitude, anything other than emotional flatlining would detract from the viewer's perception of these perfectly dressed, well-scrubbed clowns of﻿ the airwaves. It's a perfectly balanced life. Great paychecks to offset the costs of impending cosmetic surgery.

To be fair, they were smiling BEFORE hearing the story. But yeah, not the best transition.
The fire itself sounds very similar to another tragic nightclub fire ("The Station"), in which pyrotechnics started the fire and there were not clear exit signs﻿ or any kind of safety notifications - just as in this case.

From what I read, the problem was that the sound insulation (foam) made the fire spread extremely fast. It also made the smoke even more toxic. To think that this happened because of stupidity and that it's happened so﻿ many times before. :(

They were killed (at least de majority) by the smoke or trampled by other people that were trying to escape. There are at least﻿ 245 deaths confirmed.

Poor Poor RIM. With the new Superbowl﻿ ad, Sammy let's Apple off the hook. But BlackBerry became their target near their new releases. Ouch.

Android is for people who don't want to be limited to what they can do with their device. Apple is for﻿ people who want a device that just works and they don't have to think about it. BB used to be both business and anyone who wants to connect like they do on a computer. Then they lost the consumer market. Maybe they'll get it back, maybe not. It will depend on if they fixed up their developer scene. As a dev from Waterloo, I've seen the bad and have heard there's good to come. We'll see...

stubborn,
is the easiest explanation to describe samsung on this video
i own samsung until now, and i'm happy with it. but sometimes, when you become a number 1 doesn't mean you can mock up your rival. believe in yourself and keep your head﻿ low is the best﻿ way to defend your position as the number 1 smartphone maker in the world.
something can rise, something can fall. keep that in mind samsung..

The Blackberry﻿ Z10 absolutely destroys any Samsung phone when it comes to multitasking or security. That is why this ad exists. To persuade people to think otherwise.

Is Samsung insulting Blackberry users? Samsung, you made ads to make fun of Apple and it's pretty fair because they were suing you﻿ and banning sales of phones and lawsuits blah blah blah. So Samsung, why are you disturbing Blackberry anyway? They didn't even do anything to you. Are you afraid they may even dominate sales? Come on, give them a chance to shine too. It's like Samsung is being a bully, come on people working in Blackberry also need their income too

Yes I love the customization of android too, I was an droid user. But I don't like the ability of installing 3rd party apps, that means piracy. I don't think there are any great apps outside google play. I think touch wiz is the best launcher on android too, because it looks like iOS. No I don't use antivirus, that is ridiculous, that slower my phone, drain battery, what if i kill it? Does it work? A perfect machine doesn't need this, my computers don't need it also.

Third party apps are not all pirate, I use thirty party apps all the time, little fixes, different app icons etc. Most i my friends root there's, but I don't see the point. Apps are like a £1 which transfer to all my android device. Ha because it looks like iOS are you kidding right? iOS looks like Croix (Samsung operating system from pre-iphone). Don't compare Samsung to apple. Samsung are too good.﻿ On a GOOD phone, an AV doesn't slow it. Guess how many fuqs i give the you're an app developer?

They made dock on it, they made rounded shaped icons with black background, tho they have already changed it after GS1, and they copied the bounce back UI, they changed it after GS2 tho. Anyway, i love the touch wiz in GS2 because of the iOS like UI, I'm for real. I considered buying an S2 2 years ago. Too﻿ good? I heard their own OS was a huge fail! AV does slow it, you run one more app, and the app scans your phone, it surely slow down! I used it on my previous android phone, banking guy?

Another person who does not know what he is talking about. The BB10 that is coming out in 4 days on Jan 30th is the newest platform out there. It has proven to be more advanced than either﻿ IOS or the current Android platform. Samsung is aware of this, hence their adds. If this was not the case, Samsung would not have wasted their time creating a very expensive 2 minute add during the NFC playoff game.

I think i would have to punch something oder somebody when i had to drink a beer with anyone out of this﻿ commercial. Exept the two blackberry persons. They seemed the be cool.

It was clever albeit cheeky when they slammed﻿ Apple. But this ad targeting RIM is pretty sad and looks like something frat boys would come up with. The joke is old. Try being a bit more classier.

It's not really targeting RIM, there just using RIM's failures to make their product look even more﻿ awesome. The GS3 does do pretty much everything, and the Note2 does do everything. Samsung need to convince 'business' people that they don't have to buy a blackberry to still get email. I think it clever, unique and you remember! If you go to a phone shop looking for a RIM device, your now going to think about that Samsung ad, possibly even look at the GS3 or Note. The POINT of advertising.

Why does Samsung insist﻿ on making everyone with their phone act like a 20-something douchebag? Also, the local data transfer by touching phones has been around since android devices came out. Its an app called Bump. I have used it on all manner of android devices to share data with all other kinds of android devices and I didn't need a matching pair of samsungs to do it. Try advertising REAL features instead of spouting off stereotypes next time samsung. I will NEVER buy your phones.

Monitor doesn't help, there are so many apps in google play, and also what about the 3rd party app? No they can control it, it is like Windows, it is cheap, it is laggy, it lacks control.
Ah an also the sudden death of S3, means that﻿ those users cant use their phones for the whole week or more!!! Secure? No even nokia is better.

I never said it was totally secure. Blackberry is the best in this respect. I just corrected you for your wrong information.
I'll correct you again; it is not cheap (price wise), it is not laggy (Project Butter) and it sure as hell does not lack control (Android is the most controllable OS out there, almost everything can be set the way you want﻿ it).

Project butter means it runs at 60fps, thats why iOS had in 2007. It is lack of control like Windows, so that google don't have to invest a lot on security. Blackberry? Why is it the best? iOS did it pretty great﻿ too. I had used android for 2 years.

If you wanna start comparing what companies had, & which had what before who, I can go all day with﻿ the things Apple has "introduced" that have existed way before. (Which Apple make it look like they were the first to come up with). For example; video recording, panorama camera mode, LTE, voice commands, video calling, tablet computers, multi-touch input, pull-down notification bar, etc..
And Blackberry has always been businesses' number choice for email, security and more.

Why? Google isnt the only search engine.
Without Apple, android would be blackberry like.
Google was copying BB before iPhone, after iPhone it magically turned to a touch based OS.
You can﻿ search the BB like android prototype.
yea google search is original and i love it, youtube isn't, google+ isnt, andorid isnt, google play store isnt (iTunes is much better), ah, and google map, it is also a product from google i like, really useful.

1- Google isn't the only search engine, but it sure is the﻿ largest & most comprehensive.
2- iPhone wasn't the first touch screen smartphone, IBM Simon was.
3- I don't see any similarities between past Android devices & BBs. Just cuz two phones have qwerty keyboards, doesn't make one of them a copy. (Same goes for touch screen).
Apple did a great job in the past with smartphones, but now, despite being still relatively strong, iOS isn't as good as Google's Android.

1- It is the best search engine to me.
2- Did I ever say iPhone is the first touch screen smartphone? It is a fact that android magically turned to a touch based OS after iPhone. the plastic keyboard was abandoned.
3- Did you ever read my words?They WERE BB like,not the ARE BB like. Of course android doesnt look like BB now,it looks like iOS.
At least, iOS doesnt lack when viewing PDF? at least its security is far better? At least the UI is far smoother? At least they have﻿ far better ecosystem?

As an ex-iOS user, I will admit that some of the best features of the system are things like the system itself, were the updates are all on time & there's no fragmentation like there is on Android. Another thing is the smoothness. Android was a laggy operating system that iOS was way ahead of. But now, I've been using Android for 3 years﻿ (I also used iOS at the same time but stopped a year ago), & the improvements Android is making year after year are just mind-blowing. Android lag is dead.

Nope it's not. If it really is a mess, why is it the most successful and popular smartphone OS out there? It holds 59% of the smartphone market share vs 23% for Apple﻿ (others range from 4.8% to 6.8%).
Sure, the iPhone by itself may outsell several individual Android handsets. But we're talking about the systems here. Plus, you can't just say "it lags even when viewing PDF". Have you tried every single Android phone out there?

All you were able to come up with is "It is cheap, like Windows".
Regarding updates, it's not like iOS brings anything new. Android, particularly Samsung,﻿ brings improvements along with a host of new features; they even throw in an all-new UI in some cases. For example; look at the S2, almost 2 years old and yet it got an update with all the cool new features the S3 has, along with the interface. I mean seriously, has Apple even bothered to make Siri available for any iPhone older than the 4S?

3Gs, almost 4 years old, updates with new features that iPhone 5 has. Well, actually siri requires a heat sensor that is next the the ear piece, models older than 4s do not have this, and the processing power isnt great enough. It is like S2 doesnt not have enough processing power to run split screen mode that Note 2 has.﻿

Yea you need roms right? You need to root your s2 to get it. Yea you can jailbreak to get siri, it is just like flashing roms to get split view!! any problem? However, ive used siri on an iPhone 4, it is just not as fast as it is in lack of that sensor. And﻿ thats why 4s and 5 need that special sensor.

Youre too stupid, it is﻿ a special sensor, maybe the name is wrong as i dont really know what it is called, but it is a new sensor that only 4s or new devices have. It detects if there are any heat objects in front of the phone, when it detects heat, the phone will pre-launch the siri system, in case a human uses it, it runs and opens faster.

Why don't you give us a link to the iFixIt﻿ teardown where they found the heat sensor? Oh wait, there isn't one. Apple just wants you to buy the latest devices.
Also, when someone points out your mistake, calling them stupid doesn't make you any smarter.

My comment was only﻿ made to demonstrate the fact that the hardware is pretty much the same and it is only the software that differs. So, what is this special proprietary siri sensor you speak of?

First off, Siri requires no such thing as a heat sensor. Secondly, the S2 lacks split screen multitasking due to the smaller display not the processing power. The S2 can play graphic intense games, running two simple apps at the same time like the browser or messaging shouldn't be a problem at all for the﻿ Mali-400MP GPU. Even on the S3 with its large 4.8 inch display, multiwindow isn't isn't as immersive as it is on the Note 2.

As much as i agree with you why did you get in an argument with a 5 year old who hates Samsung so much yet still watches all their videos. Plus you didn't have to say anything. I think all those dislikes made our (the﻿ normal people's) point clear.

Siri was actually an app available for ANY iPhone, but Apple bought it, then removed it from the iTunes store.﻿ Then they claimed it was a "brand new" feature for the 4S...

Yup. It was an app available for download on the App Store and was also expected to make its﻿ way to Android right before Apple snatched it.

@HenryHins i am not trying to bring up facts in to the conversation because if so you will make up some bullshit no one has even heard of and i can and i can sound like i am rite.... what i am trying to say why do you have a lot of hate for android? you have used it and you didnt like it. plus you cant﻿ say android is laggy because you would have to try every single one. Android has changed a lot since jelly bean, try the nexus 4. I agree that there are some apps that make no sense on android.

Difference between Android fans and Apple fans: Android fans will explain why Android is better. Apple fans (or whatever platform you're a fan﻿ of) don't know anything about smartphones so they keep using the word "cheap".

I live in Asia, using﻿ blackberry have been a disaster for some months, 'til my cousin, the 1 that bought me the device, found out about it & persuade me to switch to iOS, while I was considering an Android-based phone. It's not abt the brand, but how far I can utilize the device based on infrastructures available. Using blackberry in my country is basically sucks, for the connection lag to its' server country/s. While now I can use my phone 4 almost anything, with RIM I was stuck with, well, BBM

And why exactly do Samsung ads look﻿ so washed off? Why did they make that decision? Apple ads are so vibrant and cheerful (same goes for other companies).

Maybe because they choose to display the world as it is. Not over saturated, doctored realities. Seriously, Apple genius ads made their own customers look like idiots... I'd take washed out reality, any day.﻿

I hate the way samsung promotes their products by dissing or as in this case "attacking" other phone manufacturers. Their products aren´t good enough to stand out of the crowd just by their own?
This doesn´t come as a big surprise ´cause their product design language is dull at its best, the devices feel cheap and plasticy, they run software that is laggy﻿ and which is just about as bad as it gets in terms of data security.
And now, all of a sudden, you want all this in your businessphone!

I'm not an Android user, but I'll admit that the Samsung Galaxy Note II is the best phone in the world at the moment. ...so it comes to a complete shock that the maker of the best phone in the world is now attacking Research in Motion. RIM should be VERY flattered. I﻿ smell fear. There is a reason why RIM shares are up 92% in the past 3 months... Blackberry 10 is turning out to be amazing! And it only benefits the consumers to have a third option. Not everyone is gonna like Apple or Android.

There are 4 options right now. You're forgetting Windows Phone which has been growing ever since Windows Phone﻿ 8.

Well... it's so easy to forget, isn't it? It's like the weird, socially awkward cousin who got his/her looks from the ugly side of the family. You know it's﻿ there, but you somehow manage to miss it when comes to party invitations.
Windows Mobile is NOT a fourth option. It's the poor alternative to the existing options. lol

Yeah, that Findows Bone thing. Good girl.﻿ It was on the tip of my tongue.
Your point is both astute and utterly redundant- masses will buy any shite they're fed. If popularity were an indication of quality - if desirability were an indication of class - I might concede...
...but no.
By that measure we should be lauding the progressive fashion sense of hoodied scum wearing their trousers below the arse.

You obviously dislike Microsoft so why even bother﻿ talking to me about this? Windows Phone is still an option people can get whether you think like the OS or not. Using big words doesn't make you look smart, and calling someone a girl isn't an insult.

Hang on a sec... "big words"?!?
Wow, I am not sure I could simplify my language further without randomly face-butting the keyboard. It takes continual effort to render my intent in anything syntactically less complex while maintaining appropriate sense, but I was certain I had achieved a reasonably succinct level of informal communication;﻿ moreover, with an obvious (if, admittedly, somewhat acerbic) dash of humour.
I regret being inconcise, though I'm accustomed to my peculiar humour failing.

hardly a cheap attack, all they said was Samsung phones are just as secure﻿ as Blackberry and everyone goes apeshit
also why would Samsung, who makes the﻿ best smartphones in the world, destroyed its completion and captured 33% smartphone market share in﻿ less than a year, be afraid of a company whose is constantly on verge of bankruptcy cause no one is buying their outdated phones and is only left with a cult following of idiots who are still stuck in 1999

The reason why I still carry a Blackberry is﻿ because I want to remain social. I dont want to be checking my facebook every 2 seconds. Its a way of forcing myself not to be so dependent on technology. Its not that Iphones or Samsungs are bad, its just I dont want to live on my phone, because I know I would.

And Samsung is just trying to take a preemptive shot at the BlackBerry 10 OS. More good news for Research In Motion.

I love Samsung and Blackberry. Samsung for making great and cheap mobile phones. I do own a Ipod Touch (for almost everything) and my Blackberry Curve for texting and calling. Although a Samsung could replace the two there are two big down sides. I LOVE PHYSICAL QWERTY KEYBOARDS!!! And that's why I love Blackberry, and probably gonna hate the bb10. Samsung should make an "easy" android. Without all﻿ the customizable android thing. I'm not a retard, but that's why Ios works better.

However, I didn't laugh at this video, nor the one with the Samsung hipsters making showing off their phones to Apple hipsters. Oh wait, I did laugh at the ugly case on the iPhone with the fake lock screen, it's funny :)

Exactly. They're trying to beat down BB10 before it has a chance to grow in the marketplace, possibly through licencing agreements that could take it beyond BlackBerry﻿ devices... just like Android. Only Android is a malware magnet starting to show its age.

I have a BB Bold 9700 and a HTC Sensation. Like the ad, the BB is for the office line and the HTC is for my personal line. To me the BB is a million times more useful for business and office work than my HTC which spends most of its time for internet, FB and sending Whatsapp msg. The biggest difference is the battery life; my BB can go on for a few days never needing a charge but my HTC nees a charge everyday. Samsung should not attack RIM﻿ as RIM has not even attack Samsung yet!

I'm a﻿ big Samsung fan, but I have to agree with some Samsung haters. Samsung doesn't necessarily make "cheap" looking devices, but considering the price point of their phones and what the competition is offering, their products are far behind in terms of design and build quality. I highly appreciate your great multitasking tools built in your phones, but if what you're gonna rely on is nothing but software, I might as well sacrifice that for a better built phone from something like Sony.

As you can't actually get a BB10 phone anywhere right now, it is by definition, NOT the best smartphone and OS right﻿ now. It is still vaporware until there are publicly purchasable models and carrier support.

That's why Blackberry devices are usually seen being used by teenagers for texting, right?
Get over yourself. RIM has produced the same devices for years now, and thanks to their total cost of manufacturing,﻿ they're essentially sold as budget devices. The age gap between those who use Blackberries is huge - 30 years, usually. 15-year-olds and 45-year-olds. I'm not sure anyone in between seriously considering buying something made by RIM.
Blackberry 10 isn't going to beat Windows Phone 7.

Really, I'm sexist because I said that the people that mainly use Blackberry devices are teenager girls - and they're usually the teenage girls﻿ that can't afford Apple devices? I wouldn't call myself a fool, nor oblivious. I'd be more inclined to call you as such, though. Teenage girls who mostly text are more inclined to buy RIM devices, mostly the traditional Blackberry. Blackberry was even the phone of choice for Teenagers in 2010.

And Samsung hasn't been making the same phone? They just build a case, throw the latest QUALCOMM processor in (that they didn't design), updates it to the latest GOOGLE operating system and thats about it. RIM does the same thing but with their﻿ own OS (not just a android skin) and makes both full touch and full keyboard phones (like every phone maker but apple these days). I am an avid android programmer and fan but the Bold 9930 is my favorite phone of all time.

Android has nothing to do with this. Its a great OS & so﻿ is BB10.

BB10 has NFC and also has the Balance mode for﻿ home and work. Samsung just sees a threat in BB10. Remember, being ridiculed is always better than being ignored.

Pretty sure that Sony isn't the leading manufacturer of Android devices. And please point me to a Sony device that has sold well over 30 million since a release from﻿ about 6 months ago. Oh wait, that title belongs to the GS3. No one cares about Sony's Android devices, and nobody has cared about RIM for years.

Good try Samsung.. showing off out dated BlackBerry phones. Bold 9700 is over 3﻿ years old. In 8 days BlackBerry 10 will unveiled let's see if Samsung can make and ad against BB10. Samsung can't even make their own OS and now they are talking about security. What a joke.

I have to agree on how defensive/offensive people get over a phone. But to those people they are a wireless leash that makes their mind up for them. They take their phones to their job and﻿ end up not doing their jobs, and the ones that "need" it for their jobs, spend more personal time on it than their jobs. I know many people who have 2 phones 1 work 1 personal, while at work they are on their personal phones more than work.

Search for "RIM’s BB10 gets a security boost with FIPS 140-2". Maybe one day Samsung will get this certification, who﻿ knows when. Until there Samsung for business is just a 'bad' joke.

I had to get my HTC Thunderbolt FIPS certified in order for me to bring it on the installation,it was a Matter of a﻿ software installation for FIPS 140-2 Level 1 the same level as BB10's certification. When any phone device reaches FIPS 140-2 Level 2/3/4 then we can talk about security boost.

Useless NFC? Rogers in Canada just released credit card payment via NFC from any BlackBerry device. 10k apps? That number﻿ is waaaaaaay too small. Try 100k (a lot less than the competition, but how does the number of apps judge a phone?). And NFC also has all the same functionalities as Samsung phones. And security goes with BES, RIM's service which is pretty much impossible to get into. Android is good at so many things, but security and business are things they have not perfected just yet.

Chrome for Android is as fast as anything else I've seen, and integrated search is a really big win. I don't see how your Blackberry bold﻿ can be 99% better than even my Droid Milestone, let alone my Nexus 10, or the Galaxy S3 or Droid DNA that are in my household.
Unless if your browser can read your mind. I guess that would give it a pretty good edge over other competitors. Does it read your mind?

My Bold actually has a fantastic browser, thank-you-very much. Can't say that about BlackBerry devices prior to OS7 though... Those are truly a pain.
Besides, the BB10 browser will be the fastest on the market. There are already videos of the pre-production software on the Dev﻿ Alpha B devices beating iOS, Android, and WP8.

BB10, just had their great "port﻿ off" to increase app development to new developers. Just like android did from the get go causing their security issues. Whatever BB had security-wise just dissappeared opening up their doors like google did.

Lol... "This comment has received too many negative votes"
Really shows how many people agree with you! And who needs a phone with a 482-core processor anyways. If the OS doesn't need it, all it's doing is wasting the battery. And RIM's previous disasters? The last complete disaster was the Storm. That phone was terrible! I can't really﻿ think of anything else.

I have a Galaxy Nexus and have never had a buggier phone. Constant random resets, complete loss of data service until a full reset when leaving WiFi coverage, the need for 2 (!) spare batteries to get through a single day... I can't wait to go back﻿ to Blackberry, Samsung.

Just look at the image Samsung paints of its customer﻿ base; dumb and nerdy! LOL They will sure sell a lot of phones with this commercial NOT! It will be their worse PR move in the course of their PDA/cell device history! :)

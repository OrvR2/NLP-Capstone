This institutions made a bet risky and big for the American people to handle.  They played with fire in a market that profits those that pray on other people's loss and misfortunes.

Lol when they did the replay in slow mo it reminded me of Dave Chappelle's skit on Prince, after Prince dunks the ball lets go of the rim and slowly hits the ground.  Jimmy had that expression on his face after throwin it down and hangin around lol shit was epic.

That's why they call it the AMERICAN DREAM, because you have to be asleep to feel it.  This is just the ugly truth that some people refuse to acknowledge, because they are in denial.

Jimmy was a badass in his own right, but he got reckless when he got his brief moment of power, and was set up by Manny and Nucky as a result of his haste.  Richard won't hesitate to kill you up close or from 100+ feet, he was loyal to Jimmy, but it doesn't mean he was any less of a killer.

The true irony of it all is that Jews and Muslims are descendents of the same man, Abraham and his sons, Isaac and Ishmael.  The Jews and Christians share a lineage from Isaac and the Muslims have a lineage from Ishmael.  Yet they still fight; even though, they all have the same blood flowing through their veins.  This is why I choose to just believe in god and not what anyone denomination tells me to believe. All of god's children are fighting over petty things like land and resources.

Because the two parties must exists in order to give us the illusion of choice that we don't really have.  Those in power are those with the most money;moreover,they are the ones who these politicians run to for endorsements and they are the ones who hire lobbyists that don't support the best interests of the public. These lobbyists really represent the interests of their corporate puppet masters.  Plus since they control the media the two major parties get the most exposure than 3rd parties.

Good point, but you have to remember Drose was playing on a sprained anke.  When healthy he can easily blow by anyone in the nba one on one.  Plus Miami was switching Lebron and Wade on him.  They threw plenty of double teams at Rose and because noone else on the team can create their own offense like Rose the Heat had a clear advantage exploiting this weakness.  Lebron is the best in the NBA and I give him plenty of credit, but he didn't shut Rose down on his own. The bulls need a good wing 2/3

I agree with that. Being able to discuss sexuality in an honest and open way is enlightening but if any person for any reason chooses not to use that ability, that does not make them any less enlightened. The ability is fine but preferences trump abilities and if any person prefers conventional sex or prefers keeping sex private, they aren't any less enlightened.

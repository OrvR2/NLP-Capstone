I love Pys. Looked at some of his other adventures. Not my style..but, love this performance . He is doing what he loves and..seriously too. The song moves me. I like it. Even the many people who have come together and did their own...GANGNAM STYLE.  It moves me and life is good. Look at some of the copiers (in love only-not stealing. )   All  I want to say right now is, it is an up lifting  song.

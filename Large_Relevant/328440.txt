0900:


Hello and welcome to our live text coverage of the fourth day of the Queen's  Diamond Jubilee celebrations. We will have regular updates from BBC correspondents on the ground. The Queen will not be joined by her consort as Prince Philip remains in hospital with a bladder infection.  


 

0901:


To give you an idea of timings, the main events today are the 50-minute thanksgiving service at St Paul's Cathedral at 1030 BST, followed by formal lunches for the royal family and a carriage procession at 1420, and a Buckingham Palace flypast - weather permitting - at 1525.   


 

0901:


For full details of today's events, you can of course check our in-depth guide. 


 

0902:


Leading national figures, including the prime minister, and members of the Royal Family including the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry - though not of course the Duke of Edinburgh - will attend the St Paul's service.  


 

0903:


For a flavour of how performers at last night's Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace shared in the celebratory atmosphere, you can read BBC entertainment reporter Mark Savage's review of the night. 


 

0903:


Hundreds of well-wishers have already gathered outside St Paul's, with one woman saying she woke up at 03.30 BST to travel to the event from her home in Essex.  She said: "My children wanted to watch it on television, but I told them the atmosphere would be so different if we were there." 


 

0904:


The St Paul's sermon will be given by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, and a special prayer of thanksgiving will be read.  


 

0904:


The BBC's Dominic Hurst reports from outside St Paul's that City of London police on ceremonial duty have been given medals to mark the Diamond Jubilee. Many are also wearing Golden Jubilee medals from 10 years ago. "It's nice to be wearing white gloves and our ceremonial tunics instead of body armour," said one officer.  


 

0905:


The Queen's former press secretary, Charles Anson, tells the BBC the Duke of Edinburgh's absence will be felt today, "but I think 'keep calm and carry on' is a phrase that might have been invented for our Queen. We've seen it in 60 years and I'm sure it will be the same today." 


 

0905:


The Queen will also give a message of thanks for this weekend's celebrations in a special address, recorded on Monday, to be broadcast at 1800 BST in the UK and across the Commonwealth, Buckingham Palace has announced. 


 

0911:


It's not just St Paul's... many churches around the UK have held services over the weekend. At Roman Catholic Masses the following prayer was said for the Queen which asked that "she may be preserved from all that is harmful and evil and being blessed with your favour may, with her consort and the Royal Family, come at last into your presence." 


 

0912:


Plenty of candles and "a lot of cake" - the BBC's Jenny Hill speaks to wellwishers who 	 	camped overnight in the Mall to make sure they got a good view of today's events.

Many on The Mall are bursting with pride as they watch the armed forces parade past. Nicola Hollihead, 32, a Gatwick airport worker, says: "When the armed forces pass through here they have their chests out and we have our flags out. It goes to show what we think of our armed forces in Britain."

The BBC's Michael Buchanan, outside the King Edward VII Hospital in London, says it is "fairly quiet" there, and there is still no official word on how the Duke of Edinburgh is responding to treatment for a bladder infection. The duke is expected to stay in for a few days, and the standard treatment for such a condition is a course of antibiotics.

The bobbies lining the road are in fine spirit, chatting to the crowds and having their pictures taken. One section of the crowd has what they describe as their own bobbies - "Give us a wave Ian," they shout, to which he responds with a white-gloved hand, and they have their own armed officer, Officer A, a much more surly-looking chap with a moustache, who is smiling nonetheless.

The St Paul's service was probably the most important part of the Jubilee celebrations for the Queen. She takes her faith very seriously, it's a very fundamental commitment for her. I thought she looked very relaxed, or as relaxed as it is appropriate to be for a service in St Paul's cathedral, but no sign of any preoccupation. I think we can be reassured, as we were saying last night, that this is not a serious health scare.
But she was listening intently to the sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury, a trenchant sermon, taking the theme of dedication as his motif; also talking about ludicrous financial greed and our society that is very superficial.

Given the duke's age any health scare is taken with concern. The duke will remain here under observation, we are told, for several days. Commentators are saying standing in the cold and wet for the pageant can't have helped the situation.

We've had everything here - rival cheering, singing of the National Anthem, and everyone coming up The Mall - even the most minor member of the Royal Family or palace functionary - gets a cheer.

The crowd is being treated to a show of strength by the immaculately turned-out soldiers, who are stomping and shuffling their way through a military drill. It's an astonishing performance from the soldiers, who sport perfectly plumped bearskin hats, boots so polished you could see your face in them and ferocious-looking bayonets.

There's a cheer as a royal convoy passes down The Mall, although no-one can quite see who is in the cars. There are of cries of "was that the Queen?" followed by a quick murmur of agreement among the crowd that it was not.

So, a recap on the timings for the events to come this afternoon: At 1420 BST the Queen and senior Royals will leave Westminster Hall for a carriage procession to Buckingham Palace, arriving at 1440 BST. At just before 1530 BST there will be a balcony appearance at the palace and - weather permitting - an RAF flypast. There will also be a "feu de joie" - a celebratory cascade of rifle fire - in the forecourt. And finally, at 1800 BST, a broadcast address by the Queen.

The soldiers might be in the middle of The Mall - but the real battle is between one side of the road and the other. One man on the left shouts "We can't let them win, come on", after a quick countdown those around him respond to his battle cry with a giant roar knocking the opposition for six.

The weather has held off enough so far, so the Royal Family are able to process as they had hoped in their horse-drawn open-topped carriages, rather than moving into other coaches.

Royal watchers at the front of The Mall are being told by police that once the Queen has passed and it is opened to the public, the crowd will be allowed in from the back first. 
This means the ardent royal fans who have camped overnight will not get near the Buckingham Palace balcony. But latecomers at the Trafalgar Square end stand a better chance. This is causing some disappointment.

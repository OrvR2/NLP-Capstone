How can you possibly think that EVERYONE hooked on prescription drugs started using them recreationally? I know a lot of people who've battled with addictive pharmaceuticals and NONE of them started taking them for fun. Just people because some people can't handle weed doesn't mean it should be made illegal for the rest of us. What about people who get addicted to food and die? Should we make food illegal too? You seem like a smart person, it's a shame you've been brainwashed by the system.

EVERYONE involved in managing or operating this club should be jailed for LIFE. How could anyone with good conscious run a nightclub knowing it had no sprinkler system, no fire escapes and insufficient fire extinguishers. 

Obviously club owners learned NOTHING from The Station fire, because this was Great White all over again. Deja vu indeed... R.I.P.

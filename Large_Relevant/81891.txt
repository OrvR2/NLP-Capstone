Lil Wayne-Tie my hands Feat Robin Thicke with Lyrics

        Lil WayneTie my Hands Tha Carter IIILyrics:We are at war With the universe The sky is falling and the only thing that can save us now is sensitivity and compassion But I know one thing's for sure I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down Lil Wayne Parts: Some say tragedy is hard to get over But some time that tragedy means its over, soulja from the academy, league of rollers I deny being down though they seem to hold us my shoulders are strong, i prove them wrong I ain't doing nothin but movin on, let the truth be known But they talk that freedom matters, and didn't even leave a ladder, damn I work at the corner store We all got problems problems ??? No one's gon save us now How you feel, you're not alone We're all just jealous jealous We don't reach the sky no more We just can't overcome no Chorus Tie my hands What am I gonna be What have I done so bad What is my destiny Tie my hands What am I supposed to see What have I done so bad What am I gonna be I, knock on the door, hope isn't home, fates not around, the lucks all gone don't ask me whats wrong, ask me whats right and ima tell you whats life and did you know? I lost everything, but I ain't the only one first came the hurricane, then the morning sun Excuse me if I'm on one, and don't trip if i light one, i walk a tight one They try to tell me keep my eyes open my whole city under water, some people still floatin then they wonder why black people still voting, cause your presidents still chokin Take away the football team, the basketball team now all we got is me to represent New Orleans no governor, no help from the mayor just a steady beatin heart, and a wish and a prayer These friends they come and go but I got family family These kids so fast they grow They learn so quickly now But there's no way to go, but there's future future Don't make this seem so low That we can't overcome Chorus and if you come from under the water then theres fresh air just breathe baby, gods got a blessing to spare yes, i know the process has so much stress but its the progress that fills the best cause i came from the projects straight to success and your next, so try they cant steal your pride its inside then find it and keep on grinding cause in every dark cloud theres a silver lining I know... Right now we just riding on love And shining dark, we aint tryna do nothing be at the heart We need love, that's all now Chorus: You tie my hands, what am i gonna be What have i done so bad, what is my destiny You tie my hands, what am I going to see What have I done so bad, what am I gonna be Born right here in the USA But due to tragedy, looked on by the whole world as a refugee So, accept my emotion, do not take it as an offensive gesture It's just the epitome of my soul And I must be me We got spirit y'all We go spirit We got soul y'all We got soul They don't want us to see, But we already know

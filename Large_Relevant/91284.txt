Obama to outline gun control plans Wednesday, including assault weapons ban, executive actionsBy Julie Pace And Erica Werner, The Associated Press | Associated Press – Wed, Jan 16, 2013

WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama's broad effort to reduce gun violence will include proposed bans on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines as well as more than a dozen executive orders aimed at circumventing congressional opposition to stricter gun control.
Obama was to announce the measures Wednesday at a White House event that will bring together law enforcement officials, lawmakers and children who wrote the president about gun violence following last month's shooting of 20 young students and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.
The broad package Obama will unveil will also include efforts to stop bullying and boost availability of mental health services.
But Congress would have to approve the bans on assault weapons and ammunition magazines holding more than 10 bullets, along with a requirement for universal background checks on gun buyers. Some gun control advocates worry that opposition from Republicans and conservative Democrats, as well as the National Rifle Association, will be too great to overcome.
"We're not going to get an outright ban," Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., said of limits on assault weapons. Still, McCarthy, a leading voice in Congress in favour of gun control, said she would keep pushing for a ban and hoped Obama would as well.
White House officials, seeking to avoid setting up the president for failure, have emphasized that no single measure — even an assault weapons ban — would solve a scourge of gun violence across the country. But without such a ban or other sweeping, congressionally-approved measures, it's unclear whether executive actions alone could make any noticeable difference.
"It is a simple fact that there are limits to what can be done within existing law," White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. "Congress has to act on the kinds of measures we've already mentioned because the power to do that is reserved by Congress."
Nearly six in 10 Americans want stricter gun laws in the aftermath of the shootings in Connecticut, with majorities favouring a nationwide ban on military-style, rapid-fire weapons and limits on gun violence depicted in video games, movies and TV shows, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday signed into law the toughest gun control law in the nation, and the first since the Connecticut school shootings. The law includes a tougher assault-weapons ban and provisions to try to keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill people who make threats.
According to a lobbyist briefed Tuesday, Obama will present a three-part plan focused on gun violence, education and mental health. He'll call for:
— A focus on universal background checks. Right now some 40 per cent of gun sales take place without background checks, including by private sellers at gun shows or over the Internet, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.
— A ban on assault weapons and limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds or fewer.
— A federal statute to stop "straw man" purchases of guns and crack down on trafficking rings.
— More anti-bullying efforts; more training for teachers, counsellors and principals; and funding for schools for more counsellors and resource officers.
Obama also will order federal agencies to conduct more research on gun use and crimes, the lobbyist said, something Republican congressional majorities have limited through language in budget bills.
On mental health, Obama will focus on more availability of mental health services, training more school counsellors and mental health professionals, and mental health first aid training for first responders, according to the lobbyist, who was not authorized to discuss the plan publicly before the president's announcement and requested anonymity.
The president's framework is based on recommendations from Vice-President Joe Biden, who led a wide-ranging task force on gun violence. The vice-president's proposals included 19 steps that could be achieved through executive action.
Obama also may order the Justice Department to crack down on people who lie on gun-sale background checks; only a tiny number are now prosecuted. Such a step has support from the National Rifle Association, which has consistently argued that existing laws must be enforced before new ones are considered.
And Obama may give schools flexibility to use grant money to improve safety.
Gun control proponent Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., who met with Biden on Monday, said the president is also likely to take executive action to ensure better state reporting of mental health and other records that go into the federal background check database. But he, too, acknowledged there were clear limits to what Obama can do without Congress' say-so.
"You can't change the law through executive order," Scott said.
White House officials signalled that Obama would seek to rally public support for the measures he puts forward, perhaps holding events around the country or relying on Organizing for America, his still-operational presidential campaign.
During his announcement Wednesday, Obama will be joined children from across the U.S. who wrote letters to him about gun violence and school safety.
One of those children, a Maryland 8-year-old named Grant, wrote: "It's a free country but I recommend there needs (to) be a limit with guns. Please don't let people own machine-guns or other powerful guns like that."
It's unclear how much political capital Obama will exert in pressing for congressional action.
The White House and Congress will soon be consumed by three looming fiscal deadlines. And the president has also pledged to tackle comprehensive immigration reform early this year, another effort that will require Republicans' support and one in which Obama may be more likely to get their backing.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has warned the White House that it will be at least three months before the Senate considers gun legislation. And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has said immigration, not gun control, is at the top of his priority list after the fiscal fights.
House Republican leaders are expected to wait for any action by the Senate before deciding how — or whether — to proceed with any gun measure.

Thanks to the Marine Corp I will always remember this: Semper Fi my brothers...
This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

My rifle, without me, is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I WILL…

My rifle and myself know that what counts in this war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. WE WILL HIT…

My rifle is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will ever guard it against the ravages of weather and damage as I will ever guard my legs, my arms, my eyes and my heart against damage. I will keep my rifle clean and ready. We will become part of each other. WE WILL…

Before God, I swear this creed. My rifle and myself are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. WE ARE THE SAVIORS OF MY LIFE.

So be it, until victory is America’s and there is no enemy, but peace!

Has there been one single order or regulation from the White House  in the past 4 years that was for the benefit of the US citizen?

FACT #1 - According to a study by the Department of Justice and Criminology at Florida State University, guns are used defensively by civilians to stop crimes between 800,000 and 2.5 million times every year (depending on which year).

FACT #2 - In 1998 there were 866 accidental deaths due to guns (Source: Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence). In 2008 there were 680 accidental deaths due to guns (source: The Survivors Club). In 2011 there were 851 accidental deaths due to guns (source: Center for Disease Control). These are all sources that would NOT minimize gun death numbers, quite the opposite for the first two.

FACT #3 - 2012 was the worst year on record for "mass shootings" in the U.S. with 16 incidents killing 88 people at the hands of some deranged lunatic with a gun. On average, there are 280 people killed every year by lightning. Literally, you are 318 percent more likely to be struck by lightning than to become the victim of a "mass shooter" (even in the worst year EVER).

Now you people can "thumbs down" this if it makes you feel better, but the bottom line is that the above is the REALITY. It's not disputable stuff. Last year there were a bit more than 11,000 homicides committed using guns, and more than 19,000 suicides using guns. There's not "thousands" of accidental deaths each year, and there are 227 people saved by guns for every one person murdered (we can't do much about the suicides). Those are the facts folks.

Now give it the "thumbs down" if it makes you feel better.

Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Tex.) says he’s willing to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Obama should the White House implement new gun regulations through executive action.

“The White House’s recent announcement they will use executive orders and executive actions to infringe on our constitutionally-protected right to keep and bear arms is an unconstitutional and unconscionable attack on the very founding principles of this republic,” Stockman said in a statement. “I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including but not limited to eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House, and even filing articles of impeachment.”
yea!

How come the same people who say that since the wording in the second amendment is not specific enough you do not have the right to bear arms are the same people who say the constitution protects abortion? Where is the word abortion even in the constitution, it's not.

The worst part is that this is all just a smokescreen for their incompetence as fiscal leaders and the inability to get a budget and reduce the deficit. They(Democraps) relish the mass killings as their step to disarming the country. These killings play right into the hands as the perfect ruse for their agenda. How many people died at the hands of Hitler?  The same could happen here if we dont fight these traitor tyrants.

Here's a plan...quit making excuses for criminals. These are a few examples to improve gun related crime. If you break into someones locked property (house, car, shop) and steal a gun = 10 year prison sentence minimum. If you use a gun in a crime = 20 year minimum sentence. This is just a start.

Talk about needing protection....Sounds like we are needing protection from our own government. They are becoming the biggest thieves and the most frightening assailant.

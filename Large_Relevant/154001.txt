emmmm..... the physics dont kind of add up.....
If it was one giant firework, then yes maybe enough downward force could﻿ overload the bridge but this would have been lots of little fireworks in a chain reaction
More likely shady construction in the bridge with those heavy lorry's on it collapsed, and that set off the fireworks when they were crushed.

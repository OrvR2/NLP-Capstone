Maybe Obama should ask this little girl﻿ for her ideas on fixing the economy. I have no doubt she's more qualified than he is.

What a pathetic chump B.O. is! This is sickening﻿ using innocent unknowing children to try to con the American people out of their 2nd Amendment rights. Who would teach their third grader to think such stupid thoughts? Some parental guidance is needed there. Poor child... Sicko POTUS!!!

And you are probably just an NRA-supporting Christian who believes the "constitutional 2nd amendment was written by God" and that "Jesus would support the NRA" if﻿ he were alive.
Point? I don't want to waste my time trying to explain to you what happens when guns are out there for ANYONE to use.
Have fun watching FOX News and keep praying that the poor innocent folks at the NRA are ok and blessed by God. And also the millions they make by selling their guns to brain dead morons like you.

Blah blah NRA. The usal ignorant babbling. Its all the "redencks" fault. Yes very inteligennt argument. Common practice of the Liberla to criminalize poltical oppostion. Its why dipshits like you make dipshits like Sean Hannity look correct﻿ to so many people. You personify a FOX news description of the left.

This is a great example for people to use to show how absurd and destructive this attack on American liberty is. After 8 years of criminal activity from Bush and Cheney. Everybody can see the opposing party is every bit as criminal and supported by people as equaly hatefull, ignorant and hell bent at destroying this nation. I think the sollution﻿ for the two Americas is obvious.

Hahahaha and you keep talking. You are quite funny.
But since you are a conservative let me ask you this:
Should humans, as equal, have the right to "pursue happiness" - If so, should gay people have the right to marry in order to be happy?
Should women be stopped from﻿ fighting because of their disadvantage(vagina)?
Should "blacks and browns" be stopped from voting because of their "uneducated opinions"(voting Democrat)?
It's not just the guns buddy. You guys are idiots.
Love,
Me.

Calm down buddy.
Psycho.
People like you is the﻿ main reason guns should never be in the hands of "average people", because every once in a while "average people" turn out being violent retards like you.
And yet you didn't answer any of my questions.
Chances are you don't have women in your life.
You don't believe in human equality and you are probably a white supremacist.
Let me guess, you're a Christian? Global warning fake? Sandy Hook was staged?
You and people like you are sad.

Because any normal person in the world would be scared out of their mind to even think properly the moment ANYTHING happens thousands of feet in the air.
Things don't compare. End.
Try to do something to a child anywhere in the world in front of other people and see how well that goes.
I don't understand how people like you can be so bloody moronic.
Comparing it to plane hijacking. Wow.
Your﻿ comment was like wiping a t-rex's after it ate a unicorn.

It wouldn't matter teachers are not armed, all he would have to do is take out the teacher than the entire classroom would be at his mercy. Small children would not be able to defend themselves there have been reports in China of people doing exactly this. Cops response time at best is 3-5 min and that's after the call is made. How many small children could﻿ a lunatic kill in that time with just a knife your the one out of touch.

Just the fact that you can plan how a person should "take out the teacher and then the kids" proves your head is not right, I want the feds to check you out seriously.
But no, you smartie pants.
These guys took out 7 adults total and then 20 children. With his body condition, he wouldn't have been able to take my grandma down with a knife. But he had a gun, so he just kept going.
All he did was pull the trigger, much effort? Woohoo.
Got a﻿ brain?
Use it.

I'm done arguing with you over this and if you don't know how effective a knife can be in the right hands then you are delusional. If you think it takes a gun to create chaos or do do severe damage to people lives then I hope you never have to learn otherwise. Yes I can see the dark side and that's why I know what can happen your probably some rich child who has no clue how hostile this world can be you can take﻿ away guns but violence will perpetuate. I suggest you take your own advice.

Listen people. THIS IS NOT ABOUT WEAPONS. THIS IS ABOUT DESTROYING THE CONSTITUTION ULTIMATELY GETTING RID OF THE CONSTITUTION ONCE AND FOR ALL. Its not about assault weapons because People can create their own semi-automatic laser burning, flame throwing, acid spraying, biomechanical weapons all of which could cause more havoc and devastation to schools all over the united states. THE REASON FOR THESE ATTACKS ON OUR CONSTITUTION IS TO GET THE PEOPLE﻿ TO AGREE TO GIVE UP ALL THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS.

:51 "if there were no guns on the street she thinks no one would get hurt." How did her parents not teach her that's﻿ not true.
The mass shooting happened in a place with gun control. Sandy Hook Elementary School was a gun free zone and it didn't work. It only made the teachers and students sitting ducks.
I agree we need to do something. We need to end gun free zones.

RON PAUL & Constitution. Cars & buses kill more Americans in America that guns kill in a decade in USA. First then BAN all CARS and BUSes !﻿ No one , especially not government workers should be allowed to drive a bus or car. Ride Bycycles. And we will all be safer, than if you ban guns. Shame on the poster of this video for using children to

@stickybadger stick to just cigarettes for a second. it clearly serves no purpose but a slow death for the smoker and those around﻿ them. If these new laws were for the greater good,Im saying they should've banned cigarettes along time ago if they're claiming they're looking for the greater good. There's nothing good about those.

Of course its a political issue. Republicans obstruct Democrats without exception, whether or not they've supported the issue in the past is of no concern. McConnell﻿ recently filibustered his own bill after he learned that Democrats supported the bill, an unprecedented act.

There are more than two party's. Two party's are left over if the insignificant party's aren't counted. The Democratic party is united. There is no reason for a split. The republican party is a convoluted array of anti-government﻿ extremists, libertarians, militants, log cabin, conservative and establishment. If there is a split it will be a republican split.

@Placer The government has no right to tell people they can't smoke. Why doesn't the government just force everyone to eat nothing but vegetables because it's healthier. Why don't we outlaw autoracing because people wreck and die sometimes. How about no gambling because it's an irresponsible use of money. The answer is because﻿ we're a free a country and we can do what we want and that includes risky behavior. Why don't we just outlaw fun and get it over with?

Liquor and cigarettes.
People are killed from drunk driving/drivers almost every other day.
Cigarettes kill people everyday. Slowly you suffer﻿ a torturous decaying death.
There's nothing positive about cigarettes when it pollutes the air,kills you and the 2nd smoker in an awfully slow and painful manor. Before we ever ended up here defending our rights,over an argument of the greater good,why the hell didn't they shut cigarettes down?

Well why we don't﻿ do something about "even one poor" ? Are Thousands of car accident with alcohol involved and people die ! Do we ban alcohol everywhere ? You come with weak arguments, go help something born instead of writing comments about the unborn.

So you want﻿ to kill millions of innocent babies,great arguement. But like alcohol use, we as a civilized society have made it tougher for people who do drink and who drink and drive. We have severe penalties for those who break the laws and those who kill others while being drunk.This happened by people becoming aware of the realities of their bad choices and the impact they have on society.I suggest we do the same with Abortion. I guess you like the status quo do nothing and ignore the problem.

Constitution gives us right to bear arm, but does Constitution say or gives us right to have AK47 or guns who discharge 100 round ammunition? I think we dont need guns who discharge that many round. Do you know NRA is not represent a people. It is represent a gun companies.So Dont Believe what NRA a feed u

Apples and oranges. 7% opposing background checks is a completely different than your claim that 70% of NRA members do not agree with the NRA.
You do understand that we already have universal background checks, right? The gun show loophole (as many like to﻿ bring up) is grossly exaggerated. Most firearms used in crimes are themselves obtained by the commission of a separate crime, hence the volumes of laws that affect only the law abiding citizens.

"When banning assault weapons, large capacity magazines and instituting universal background checks are considered “attacks﻿ on second amendment rights” while children are murdered in elementary schools and theaters in this country what else is there to say?
NRA’s own members are in favor of addition measures, over 70% according to polling, yet their leadership continues to doubles down on its “guns for everyone” agenda. America needs an alternative to the NRA's politically motivated agenda."

That you﻿ would dismiss this as fantasy sows just how ignorant you are. Do some research before you speak. People like you are the reason we have thousands of laws that solve nothing.

How about dangerous drivers﻿ and road fatalities?
Are you going to ammend the constitution to stop this problem?

Also, the parent letting this kid watch the news "all day on the Friday" about﻿ a situation like this is extremely irresponsible. Any child of this age is﻿ not independently capable of processing these events rationally and healthily (never mind contributing anything useful to policy and laws). Obama and everyone else involved - you should be ashamed of your cynical exploitation of a child's fears, emotional well-being and development.

Banning "Assault Weapons" e.g. Machineguns is senseless. They are expensive, not to mention the ammunition required to operate it.
Most major shootings involve affordable semi-automatic firearms anyway.
The only firearm invented I﻿ consider 'dangerous' is the TEC-9, but that is designed for illegal purposes.

I agree with you but if the government has tech's than we should to we can't be out gunned by them if they get tyrannical that's the point of the second amendment to defend ourselves from them. Full autos are great for suppressive fire. They aren't used by smart criminals cause they jam Sammy the"Bull" gravano(mob hitman) always said take a revolver on a hit cause they don't jam smart criminals know this. The full auto ban(the hughes amendment)was just chipping away﻿ at our constitutional rights.

You're scared of criminals with guns, little girl? Well, have I got something to tell you. Criminals﻿ are scared of law abiding citizens with firearms to kill them.

I cannot vote a video with a thumbs up or down, comments as well. I have been too verbose in matters of consequence. So you aren't that far off the﻿ mark, they're just hitting outspoken people for now. When the legislative branch is candid with the guns in Mexico perhaps then we might discuss guns, until then it is simply view as a gun grab from every thinking person.

Dear President Obama,
Below I have written exactly what your publicists have told me to write to make it seem like children care about gun violence, and to use my age and the massacre at Sandy Hook to further your anti-gun﻿ propaganda. I applaud your administration and the other gun grabbers of the US for harnessing yet another tragedy to attempt to revoke my right to personal protection.
Sincerely, Hinna

Obama I'm glad you have the balls to use children to push your agenda. Why don't you tell them the truth? The﻿ girl asks "can we stop using guns?" Are you willing to stop using guns? The answer is no, because the government is all about using guns to make people do what they want, and the less of us that have guns the more the government gets to to what it wants. Tragic incidents like the recent mass shootings are just a convenient excuse for a pre-existing agenda.

My question is the kids you use on TV are they protected ay school? Any armed guards? No. Obama said we don't need that.
His kids? All protected,but every﻿ kid he uses to put on TV as a pawn is NOT protected. Why are we letting hyprocrits talk about our rights?

How the hell you twist your fingers to address my comment w such lack﻿ of thought is hilarious. You are clearly stating his children deserve to be protected over any other child. How often are the protected children hurt or kidnapped? Now turn on the news and compare that to the unprotected kids on Tv.

I understand if people believe that guns keep a safer country. I don't agree with that, but I'm willing to have that argument some other day.
But, I feel bad about people making attacks at the kids reading their letters. How are they being brainwashed? Recently, many innocent kids at school were killed by a man with a gun. It seems very natural that the childrens' reactions would be to be afraid of guns. Obama is not brainwashing here; he's just giving them a chance to share their﻿ fears.

We should respect and protect individual liberty. Criminals do not obey laws, they bypass them. Banning "Assault Weapons" will create a black market. Prohibition creates crime and costs tax payers money. Why is it that mass shootings only happen in places that prohibit firearms? Criminals who want you dead will always find a way. Disarming citizens will leave us defenseless against corrupt local government, criminals and tyranny. Tyranny is not﻿ a joke, it can be as simple as unlawful arrests.

Mr President, it makes me have nightmares now & I'm afraid to go to see my Grandma again, can TSA stop hurting us kids? it make us feel bad.
How many people would line up on that issue?
The White House is pushing TSA to be at schools, sporting events & on public buses: harm is more then just a bullet!

It is truly sad how the Left brainwashes and manipulates children for use as pawns in their statist agenda; just as in other socialist dystopias of the past, so also here in the Soviet Socialist Democratic People's Republic of Obamastan. Next, children will be programmed to inform the Gestapo when their parents show﻿ any signs of disloyalty to Big Brother.

In fact , these "experts" are﻿ still trying to convince us that their is no connection to each of these mass shootings and mental illness , when in fact it's obvious each shooter was seriously mentally ill and everyone else knew them to be prior to the shootings.
The APA needs to be brought up on charges of professional incompetence

How vile can this administration get? Obama doesn't care about these children, that is apparent to anyone with a high functioning brain.
If he cared he would have taken effective action instead of a list of 23 items, none of which would have stopped Adam Lanza.
Using children as props is something one might﻿ expect out of Hollywood, but our president? HHMMMNNNN.....

Guns are used everyday to protect people and stop crimes. The only answer for a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, PERIOD. Law abiding citizens have the right to﻿ defend themselves.﻿ It's that simple.
Usually the police try, but most of the﻿ time all they can do is clean up and investigate.﻿ Also﻿ the police are under no legal obligation to risk their lives for us, and unfortunately often don't. Remember that when seconds count, the police are at best minutes away.

Check out the 'TheArmedCitizen' channel, it is full of local news clips of examples of lives saved because of guns. It's sad that more of these don't make it on﻿ the national news. Just last week there was a women in Georgiaa who protected herself and her children when some mad man/criminal broke into her house with a crowbar. They hid in a closet, but the man came after them - she shot him 6 times and he still managed to run away and was caught later.

Well lets see, vulnerable women are empowered when an intruder enters their home. They are able to save not only their own lives but the lives of their children as well. I shouldn't have to pull﻿ up the numerous news articles on that. On most occasions, just having it there as a threat is good enough to stand most people down in situations.

ARE YOU A GOOD PERSON? Have you ever told a lie? yes or no. Have you ever stolen something? yes or no. So if God judges you only on 2 of the Ten Commandment will you be innocent or guilty? Heaven or Hell? For God said, all liars and thieves cannot enter heaven but will goto hell. Does that concern you at all? But Jesus bore the sins of﻿ those who CONFESS and REPENT(turn from sin and turn to Jesus) and put their faith and trust in Him as there Lord and Savior shall have everlasting life. REPENT!!

Oh yea right, you bulletheads are so polite and respectful. You leave such thought provoking insight to the out﻿ of control murder rate in America. You deserve to be treated with respect, NOT.

yeah, a murder rate of 4.8 per 100,000 is terrible isn't it... and the fact that more murders are committed with knives,﻿ hammers and baseball bats than guns doesn't mean anything to you.. guns are the problem because they're big and scary looking so they're the worst... liberal logic at it's best .. go ahead and tell me why the top 5 gun owning nations average around 6 murders per 100,000 people and the top 5 murder nations only average 6 guns per 100 people... consider yourself served

You started off by disrespecting the president with some pretty vile republican name calling so don't pretend you should be treated with dignity and respect. The fact is republicans don't trust scientists, economists, or news﻿ sources whether public private, foreign or domestic. Republicans create the fantasy they choose to live in, and reality bounces off their heads like tennis balls.

Once again you're posting deception. What roll did Obama play in turning record surpluses into record deficits? None, the deficit has been shrinking. Millions of families fell victim to the bush downfall and are in need of assistance. Obama's payroll tax cuts expired. All of Obama's executive orders are Constitutional. He should know, he's a Constitutional lawyer
"the scum in office will exploit whoever they can to push their agenda of fear and﻿ corruption" That was the line that got me going.

The 2nd amendment was a sentence written over two hundred years ago. Since then muskets have evolved into high powered, mega clip weapons of mass murder.﻿ The NRA gun manufactures lobby tells us it doesn't matter. As technology advances, the ability to kill advances. There should be no limit to the power, or capacity of a weapon and anyone should have access to as many weapons as they want. If bulletheads control laws, in 100 years they'll be incinerating thousands at a time with particle beams.

The problem of gun violence in America is a direct result of drug prohibition. Ninety-five percent of all gun incidents are drugs/gang related. End the obscenely corrupt policy of prohibition, which in reality is a government﻿ subsidy to organised crime, & the crime rate will plummet. Tax & sell marijuana like alcohol & the tax revenues would pay for mental health services. People need to wake up & realise the problem is not gun ownership, its denying people the right to chose their own medicine.

Corporate psychopaths are wolfs in sheeps clothing, predators by definition.
"Yes, politicians are more likely than people﻿ in the general population to be sociopaths. I think you would find no expert in the field of sociopathy/psychopathy who would dispute this...That a small minority of human beings literally have no conscience was and is a bitter pill for our society to swallow -- but it does explain a great many things, shamelessly deceitful political behavior being one." -Dr. Martha Stout

"Our main agenda is to have ALL guns banned. We must use whatever means possible. It doesn't matter if you have to distort facts or even lie. Our task of creating a socialist America can only succeed when those who would resist us have been totally disarmed." -Sarah Brady, President of Handgun Control, Inc., to Senator Howard Metzenbaum - The National Educator, January, 1994, Page 3

great, now we are using kids to support somebody's agenda. So why do we have voting age﻿ restrictions? Isn't it because kids are often too wrong? You are picking kids who are dependent on their parent's opinion, that's filthy mr. President. Why don't you ask to show their parents reading from these pages﻿ written by white house in attempt to impersonate children thoughts?

If they take our guns, they take our guns. Follow God's laws first and man's laws second. If man's laws conflict with God's laws don't fret be humble and accept the consequences of not following mans law. God will keep you in his mercy. Do not resist evil, be humble toward those in authority for they have the power to take your head. The punishment is﻿ far greater than the action. Put your trust in the hands of the higher protection. Let God avenge your enemies. Try to be at peace with all men.

I believe if the shooter in CT had chosen his mother's deer rifle instead of a bushmaster, 20 children would not have died in quick succession (he chose what he did for a reason--semiautomatics which make killing easy). I believe if Gifford's killer had not had to change clips, he would also have killed far more. If it were up to me, I'd agree with Governor Reagan, and ban all firearms for civilian use outright. They should be for a well regulated militia (police and military), and that's it.﻿

The very nature of a criminal is to acquire things illegally, remember?
And I'm not saying such a thing, I'm merely saying that, being﻿ ensured that they will adhere to limitations, a regular person can have a basic firearm for the sake of self protection, rather than having to fend off the trouble possible to come their way with tableware.

But where is the logical conclusion of that farcical argument? If you're only allowed to own a bushmaster, won't a bad guy find a rocket-launcher? So if we don't let you have rocket-launchers too, then only bad guys will have rocket-launchers, and your silly bushmaster won't do you much good. So should everyone be entitled to bazukas? To nerve agents? To ICBMs?﻿ To nuclear bombs? Where do you draw your arbitrary line? Mine is easy--ban them all. Fewer guns is fewer for all- including criminals

Drugs are illegal, but plenty of people still do them﻿ too.
And if it's one person against another, then a bushmaster would likely deal death faster and more efficiently than a rocket launcher.
And what of someone trying to break into the house of another? Do they blow the place up with a rocket launcher and fish whatever they can out of the rubble? And what of the cost of said weapons as a factor?
This is real life, not an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.

Oh, but "cost is not a factor for criminals," as we always hear from the gun loons, because "criminals will always find a way," right? Isn't that your argument for not banning guns? You're more likely to injure yourself or have someone injured in your own home than to ever use your gun for "defense." People don't bring a drug to a school to cause a mass murder. Drugs should be legal, and you﻿ can grow or make your own drug; it's much harder to make a gun.

You're beginning to sound overly presumptuous, even for a liberal.
And it completely depends what sort of criminal you're talking about if you were to consider﻿ certain factors.
If there's one atrocity, it's the prescription of dangerous drugs to people, especially kids.
If you are referring to the case of the Connecticut school shooting, then I must say that it was an example of the type of irresponsibility I was talking about that the woman had so many unnecessary guns but the bigger issue was-

Thats' not the issue neither is the Mother not keeping the guns from the hands of her adult son
The issue is mental health LAWS , particularly in Conn where﻿ there is no way for involuntary commitment of the seriously mentally ill. ..like there is in other states.
The seriously mentally ill should be put back in institutions,not drugged up ,sent back out into society in hope the meds continue to subdue them and that they dont miss a dosage. If someone cant grasp reality without meds , commit them

But meds make the psychologically troubled worse, and therapy makes them better.
It's unclear when trying to recognize a psychological problem, whether it's too serious or not, but sending them to institutions has costs. And it's also good if you have faith in someone, just, please, no meds. I've seen for myself how they worsen people`s way of thought, and how those who take meds tend to only get prescribed more for the sake of solving the problems caused by other meds﻿ in the first place.

Oh, right, because the meds went into the school and shot 20 first graders. Are you really this insane? Maybe we should prescribe some meds for you. You can't seem to arrange cause and effect on even the simplest terms. We could have﻿ the craziest people in the world, and if they didn't have access to Bushmasters, they wouldn't do a bit of harm. How is any of that presumptuous? The fact that you are more likely to injure yourself with a gun than to use it for defense is a cold, hard, fact.

You know, the same thing happened on the very same day in China, and as opposed to the shooter in Connecticut that man used a knife to cut down 22 people.
You﻿ again don't seem to have any examples to prove YOUR argument with, so I'll just dismiss you for now saying that it's very unwise to imply that people should be prescribed drugs so easily, and just goes to show how ass-backwards your logic is as to think that it's the easy, 'modern' solution.

Well maybe because if you look past﻿ an irrational fear of guns, the obvious cause behind mass shootings in mental illness, lack of Mental Health Care, and dangerous prescription drugs such as SSRIs.
I've gone back and looked at your earlier postings, and it's obvious that you're just a troll. I'll be ignoring you from on now.

The other main cause of mass shootings -- at workplaces, rather than schools -- is jealousy, ended relationships, or﻿ desire for revenge against bosses. You can't medicate that away, although sharing mental health documentation with respect to gun purchases would reduce the medically-crazy shooters. But with human frailty in mind, putting MORE guns in the hands of people who have passionate hatreds or maybe just have bad days ISN'T the solution. This isn't "irrational fear of guns" (cont'd)

Mexico is a country whose corrupt government is infiltrated by drug cartels, who turn a blind eye to the distribution of guns among its members; it's﻿ our phony war on drugs which empowers them and causes it to happen. You're an idiot--you have no geopolitical comprehension whatsoever.

Yes, the full text says that the individual states have a right to organize a well regulated militia, independent from control of the federal government, from the private citizens within those states in order to ensure the protection of their freedoms. It has not changed or rescinded, and in order to form a militia, the people need access to arms sufficient to counter an﻿ opposing enemy force or standing army that would oppress them. Read Federalist 46. Muskets back then were "assault rifles".

"Federalist 46" is NOT the Constitution. You don't have a clue what you're talking about, and you have no understanding of firearms, either; to compare a musket to an "assault rifle"﻿ is laughably absurd. You also have no sense of irony, using "Minuteman" as your screen name, when the original minutemen were citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the most liberal state in the country, where I happen to reside, with some of the strictest and most effective gun laws.

I'm simply putting the firearms technology of the day into the context of what we have today. The Federalist papers are the "minutes" of the Constitutional Convention for the creation of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and if you really want to know what the Founders meant when they wrote certain passages then I suggest you read them. If the revolution were fought today it would have been with AR-15's and AK's. Technology has﻿ not changed anything in the Constitution.

You CAN'T put the technology of our era into the context of﻿ 200 years ago, because what we have today would have been inconceivable to the Founders. The Federalist papers are NOT the "minutes" to the Convention--they are individual opinionated commentary by individual contributors, nothing more. All rights granted have reasonable limits--from speech to assembly--and firearms are no different. Revolutions today use tanks, bombs, and planes--do you have a personal "right" to those "arms" as well?

Yes, the individual opinionated commentary from the people who actually helped write the thing, including James Madison who happened to pen﻿ the 2nd Amendment and also had a quote to the effect of ensuring that a standing army and police force in the U.S. were never better armed than its citizens. Are you opposed to self defense?

Oh, so now that you realize you didn't know what you were talking about, you're changing your historical tune? First it was the "minutes," and now you agree with me (and reality)? Thomas Jefferson was also an individual contributor; he was opposed to the abolition of slavery in the Constitution.﻿ Does that make him a reliable witness, just because he also contributed, to what it should mean today? & should you have nukes and F16s at your disposal so you're as well-armed as the U.S.? Dumbass.

Actually in TJ's original draft of the Declaration of Independence he wanted to abolish slavery. In order to get the unanimous vote of all 13 colonies required for the Declaration, he﻿ was forced to remove it, as the southern states would not sign on. Now you are the one being absurd talking about nukes and fighter jets. You and I both know they were talking about the equipment a standard infantryman would be carrying. Dumbass. Now answer my question, do you oppose self defense?

Thomas Jefferson WAS one of the objectors from the South! John Adams of Massachusetts was a proponent of abolition. Stop arguing with me about things you don't even understand. Nobody needs a "bushmaster" for "self-defense." The Constitution doesn't clarify what an "arm" is; they had muskets. Today we have nukes, ICBMs, fighter jets, and chemicals. Those are also "arms." So why draw the line at a bushmaster? Why not a tank? You gun﻿ loons have no grasp of logic OR history.

Arms by definition are "military ordinance". AR-15's are great for self defense. In fact a kid in Texas defended his home from not one but four home invaders with his father's AR as he was trained and skilled enough to use it properly. No, TJ was not one of the original objectors, he agreed with John﻿ Adams, put it into the original draft and it was rejected by the Continental Congress of 1776. Hell, you can Google that fact. Google what Tories were while you're at it. You'd be one of them.

The Constitution does NOT say "military ordinance"= "arm;" it doesn't say anything. Your definition is arbitrary and ridiculous. One AK defense does not justify 20 kids slaughtered; the perp did not choose the deer rifles (and he could have: his mother had those, too) for a reason. All rights have reasonable limits. Guns are no exception. And TJ was a slave owner who supported slavery, like the rest of the South.﻿ The divide on the subject mirrors the republican/Democratic state split today.

The Constitution﻿ also doesn't say "musket" or "muzzle loader" either, so your belief in what it was referring to is arbitrary and ridiculous. Look up "arms" in a modern dictionary. Next, it is not just one incident, but several if you would actually do some research. Homicides by any type of rifle accounted for only 3.5% of all gun related homicides in 2011 according to FBI crime stats, and AR/AK type rifles are a subset of that number. Way to pinpoint the actual problem.

If banning rifles eliminates 3.5% of gun related homicides, that's good for me! Not "good enough"--I would go much, much further. We have plenty of ground to cover. But it need not be a panacea for me to embrace it. Only a fool or a knave makes perfect the enemy of good. And my point is not that a "musket" should be the the only "arm," but why not "military ordinance" nuclear "arms," or nerve agent "arms" ? Your "gun" line is arbitrary. I would ban them all for civilians. Clean and absolute.﻿

That is your opinion. It is a completely naive and﻿ dangerous, but it is your opinion. I ask you this. How do you propose to to make arms based upon technology that has been around for 100 years magically disappear? Banning on paper them does nothing. You only ensure that those who keep the law are unarmed victims for predators to prey on at will. Look at Chicago, unarmed citizens and, 532 murders in 2012.

Chicago is the victim of all the redneck states which continue to allow a free-for-all on gun purchases, then bring them to IL. When﻿ we ban guns, it puts fewer into the stream of commerce than there would be if we didn't enact a ban. That makes fewer guns for EVERYONE to get their hands on, including criminals. Your logic is again flawed; if we don't allow civilians to own nuclear bombs, will only bad guys have them? It's pure craziness. How many times must I repeat this simple premise for you?

You are losing this argument on every front due to the tone in which you post. There are no "redneck states" that allow﻿ a "free for all" on gun purchases. Every time you go to a FFL dealer, they conduct a background check and you fill out the BATFE's form 4473 for the transfer. There is a paper trail for every gun purchased legally in the US. The UK Home Office of Statistics for 2011 lists them at having 2000 violent crimes per 100,000 people. Total gun ban. The US has only 392 per 100,000.

You've already CONCEDED that actual MURDERS are lower in the UK (and Canada, and France,﻿ and Germany, and Spain, and, um...virtually every other country in western Europe with strict gun laws). So instead you trotted out the tired old trope of "violent crime," whose definition is ambiguous, and to which I will gladly suffer any day as opposed to being MURDERED, and I'm sure you would as well.

I have conceded nothing. "Violent crime" includes rape, murder, assault with deadly weapons that encompass any instrument other than your own hands, armed robbery, home invasion, etc. You believe that it is morally acceptable to be a victim, than an﻿ armed citizen who can defend themselves with greater power than the assailant no matter what their goal. I have a gun, guy tries to rob me with knife, I win. Guy tries to rape girl, girl has gun, girl wins. Gov't tries to enslave people, we have guns

Oh, right, because your AK47 or silly "bushmaster" will do a GREAT job standing up to the government when they come to "enslave" you with their tanks, planes, and nuclear bombs. On what planet do you spend the majority of your time, seriously? All "violent crime" is not alike. In Europe, you are less likely to be MURDERED. Period. I'll choose my life any day. You're more likely to be killed or injured﻿ by your own weapon than to ever use it in self-defense. You're beyond absurd.

You miss the point of the Second Amendment. If 300 million people are armed with guns no tyrant wannabe would dare try it. No people with guns and they could do whatever﻿ the hell they wanted to (assuming enough control over the army). The point of the S. A. is not victory (which *is* possible through sheer numbers and strategy) but a deterrent Which is why, historically, tyrants-to-be enforce gun confiscation laws just before enacting totalitarian dictatorship.

Right, because among 300 million people, all 300 are going to automatically take the same side (i.e. against the "government")? I sometimes wonder what universe you﻿ gun loonies inhabit.

Your looney your trying﻿ to violate the constitution of a country your not from. Talking about laws that don't affect you and that you know nothing about. You make crazy generalizations about gun owners. You have a seething hatred for Americans and our constitution that comes through in your comments. No one needs to hear your opinion you have no say in our elections as your not a citizen. All your notions about Americans come from tv. But your just a mentally ill troll.

It is pointless using "Europe" in﻿ comparisons with the USA as Europe is made up of distinct political entities with their own issues and approaches to solving them.
We need to compare murder rates (not just gun murder rates which will obviously change) pre- and post-gun controls preferably within the same region; failing that, areas that are politically and culturally very similar. Otherwise, correlations do not prove anything.

Western Europe has arrived at consensus on guns:﻿ against them. There is a correspondingly devastating correlation between fewer guns, and fewer murders. Just because there may be more murders today than before there was a gun ban is dispositive of nothing; if there was no gun ban, murders would have risen MUCH higher. Numerous factors contributed to an increase in crime (influx of immigrants post WWII, recession, &c), but this would have been FAR higher if guns were ubiquitous as well.

You are making my point that statistics don't prove anything on their own. But then you go on to project based on nothing but personal opinion.
I don't argue for or against guns, just for rational politics and accurate interpretation of laws.
Please provide the source of your argument that there are fewer murders﻿ with fewer guns, bearing in mind my previous comment about comparing disparate regions and not comparing gun murders (which are obviously going to be lower).

"Western Europe has arrived at a consensus on guns: against them". Please refrain﻿ from inaccurate and vague generalisations. What does "against them" mean? What kind of guns? Total ban or license restrictions? Carrying or in the home? Switzerland has different gun laws than the UK (besides, whether Western European politicians are "against them" or not is not really germane nor does it consider the opinions of an informed populace).

If my "silly" Bushmaster could do nothing against a possible tyrannical takeover of our government, then why on earth do they want to keep us from having them so bad. It has nothing to do with public safety. Statistics prove it. I live on﻿ planet Earth, all of the time where there are evil people who care nothing about laws. Not in some fairy land where we drink peace Kool-Aid and shit rainbows. You are more likely to be killed by a drunk driver then killed accidentally by one of my firearms.

OK, troll, you are assuming that 100% of the U.S. military would turn on their mothers,﻿ fathers, sisters and brothers, ignoring their oath to protect and defend the Constitution from all threats foreign AND DOMESTIC, and begin mowing us down in the streets. It would be unwise to use tanks, and bombs on your own soil, as you would destroy your own infrastructure, and rebuilding would require resources that you just destroyed. 80 million gun owners vs. 5 million active duty. We win.

You goose﻿ stepping moron. We're not anti-government. We're anti-tyranny. There is a difference. Tyranny is when 51% can vote to take away the rights of the other 49%, and that is what we are seeing right now. I'm not guilty of any treason. It those who have been elected who are guilty of treason. Read the damn Constitution, and you will see how much the Fed has trampled on it. Like at Lexington and Concord, we will not shoot first, you will be the aggressors.

When the opinion of 51% decides which way the country goes over that of 49%, it's called democracy. Tyranny is when a minority (usually of 1 dictator) forces its view on the majority. Be a man and accept﻿ this simple fact. Don't be a cry-baby.

So if 51% of the nation voted to exterminate all law abiding gun owners you'd be OK with it? Tyranny is tyranny﻿ no matter how many ways you slice it when it comes down to the fundamentals of taking away someone else's liberty to suit your own beliefs.

If 51% vote to change the law to﻿ take away your guns, then you'll have to comply. If you don't agree with this system then you need to educate yourself about how the concept of democracy works.

No I don't have to comply. The 2nd Amendment is absolute and bullet proof. It cannot be amended, restricted, or changed with any legislation. That is why the Founders told the Fed it SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED PERIOD.﻿ My right to arms is granted by God, and no vote can take it from me, unless I lay down and give up. We are not a democracy. We are a republic. In a republic 99% cannot vote to take away the rights of the other 1%.

It's 2013. Your guns are no good. What you need instead, is a way to make government transparent. Don't complain about big brother watching you. Work instead, to create systems to watch big brother. Collectively, citizens are bigger than any government can ever be. There is this thing called Open Data, and RDF and the Semantic Web. Put your guns aside for a moment and read about it a bit. The world has changed a lot since the 18th century, and perhaps we need to﻿ change our way of thinking too.

I understand that. Information is a powerful thing. The problem is that information is useless when Homeland Security decides to unleash the 2 billion rounds of ammunition they bought last year. That is way more than they need for target practice, and is enough to shoot every﻿ man, woman, and child in the U.S. 4 times. They're prepping for something, so I would like to have my own hardware to back it up.

Well we don't allow drunk driving, EITHER. Does that eliminate all drunks who drive? NO. But OUI rates have fallen dramatically from the time we started cracking down. The same goes for your firearm toys. The sick fuck in CT didn't﻿ choose the deer rifle--he chose the bushmaster, for a reason--and that's why they should not be legal, and that's why 20 children are dead instead of six where the shooter had to change a clip (in the case of Giffords).

The PURPOSE of a truck is not to kill. While most trucks are employed to productive use, their use as a weapon cannot be prevented. Guns (especially assault rifles) have only one purpose﻿ - mass murder. Case closed.

Well then I guess we should disarm the police and military then as well. If I don't﻿ need them to protect myself, then they don't need them to protect themselves, since all they can do with them is mass murder, we should remove all guns from all sides. The gov't are our employees. We are the employers, since when do employees tell the employers what the employer can and cannot have, and what they can and cannot do?

Here we go again, with your idiotic logic. You cannot seem to develop the neural synapses required to move beyond spouting right-wing radio talking points, can you?

No, that is your level of brainless stupidity. Your argument centers around banning guns to, "save just one life." Well if that is your argument, then we should be looking at what causes the most deaths in the US and ban those items, and it is not guns. My point is, no matter what you "ban" people will﻿ always find a way to kill people. Stop blaming the tools, and start blaming the people who perpetuate the violence.

People can't kill people as﻿ easily when they don't have guns. It's the same rationale for banning drinking and driving and for not allowing smoking in restaurants.

Not to mention the fact that about 90% of the violence in Chicago is conducted between criminal gangs. No sir, I tear down criminal files for a living. Registration does nothing, it only tells the cops that the gun was stolen at some point, and most of the﻿ time the serial numbers are filed off. What part of, "SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED PERIOD," is so difficult of a concept for you to understand?

I couldn't care less about "registration." I want a gun BAN. ALL rights﻿ have reasonable limits--from speech to assembly; you can call them "infringements" if you want, but they exist, and they are Constitutional. The right to bear arms in a well regulated militia is no different. You need to get a grip on Constitutional law before you go espousing the Constitution.

You've already lost that argument. The US Supreme Court already ruled that the phrase, "...the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed," applies to an individuals right to bear arms, and not a collective right based on membership in a militia. Sorry, but constitutionally YOU LOSE! Oh,﻿ and by the way, the 2nd Amendment is the only one in the Bill of Rights which expressly FORBIDS GOVERNMENT REGULATION BY STATING THAT IT SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED!

Umm, the Supreme Court also ruled that Dred Scott could be recovered to human bondage. It's a product of the neanderthals sitting﻿ on the present court, which is ephemeral, not an insightful interpretation of the Constitution.

Well, that just so happens to be the mechanic for which the Constitution is to be interpreted according to the rules set forth in the Constitution, so you still lose. There is no higher authority than the Supreme Court for an interpretation of its language. I tell you what though. You can grab your baseball bat, join a goon squad to confiscate my guns in﻿ the name of peace, come to my house, and see what happens to you.

I wouldn't want to come anywhere near ignoramusland, so set your worries aside. You can continue to live in the 19th century, where you shove theology down people's throats, fight equality, ban﻿ women's rights, and play John Wayne fantasies in your head. I'll stay here in the 21st century, thank you.

Yes stay in the 21st century, because here in the 21st century you can do all of those things with just an iPad. People have not changed with time. Everything you see before you is nothing more than history repeating itself over and over again. It is a cycle of those who made sacrifices for freedom, the country prospered, became prideful, fell away from its founding principles in pursuit of the illusion of "greater enlightenment", and﻿ then tear themselves apart from within. We just have nukes.

That, I'm afraid, was an incoherent ramble. People do change. We have become more tolerant--at least some of us; we understand the world was not created 6,000 years ago--at least some of us; we know that women are as smart (or smarter) than men--at least some of us; we devote ourselves to science--not 2,000 year old singular works of fiction. I feel sorry for you. In every learned age, there are those who fight change, then﻿ are left on the ash heap of history.

No, I support my right to determine my own destiny. You support taking that right away. You can put whatever spin on it you want, but the fact is that as long as I have a gun in my hand and a knife at my side, in the end, no one tells me how to live my life. The stats on this vid show that your way of thinking is in the minority, and those who﻿ don't learn from and appreciate that, "ash heap of history," are doomed to repeat it as we are now.

Yeah, if someone drops a bomb on your head, you really get to decide how to live your own life, just because you have a "gun and a knife." You're such a troglodyte; a veritable flat-earther, relying on the stats of a youtube video to encourage yourself in your denial of a paradigmatic﻿ shift in public opinion following the bushmaster massacre in Newtown, with every poll showing a majority favoring banning those weapons, banning large clips, favoring universal background checks, &c.

The Bushmaster did not leap out of the vehicle by itself, home in on 26 people and mercilessly slaughter them with heat seeking bullets. It was the work of a deranged lunatic who broke 46 laws to do what he did. How would 47 laws have prevented it? Like I said, when you grow a ball sack, come to my﻿ house and try to take it from me, instead of lobbying congress to pass an illegal law to make me a criminal for doing nothing wrong except exercise my Constitutionally protected right to bear arms.

He didn't break﻿ 46 laws. He stole a legally purchased bushmaster from his mother that shouldn't have been legal. He'd have been left with a deer rifle, and 20 children would not be dead.

Oh, so should we allow everyone to own nuclear bombs in suitcases, because otherwise only "black market criminals" will have nuclear bombs in suitcases? This trope is a logical farce, perpetuated by mindless right-wing radio zombies. The fewer guns there are in the stream﻿ of commerce, the fewer guns there are--PERIOD. Including on the Black Market. They can't be on the black market if they're not allowed in the market...is that really so difficult for you to get through your thick skull?

Alright, let me ask you something, you fool: can I go buy some magic fairy﻿ kryptonite on the "black market," just because I can't buy it somewhere else (supposing it's illegal)? No. Because there IS not magic fairy kryptonite. The black market can't GET what doesn't exist. Guns will not be nearly as numerous if we BAN the production of guns. Why are you unable to meet reality?

It's the right wing pushing a wall with Mexico﻿ (albeit for racist, xenophobic reasons). And there would be no need for a wall to halt the flow of guns here if we didn't have a pointless drug war going on in the U.S., because it would create no market niche for narcos. Ships can have their cargo inspected.

One more thing. Nukes, bombs, tanks, jets and warships are completely different from small arms. Those items were not developed by civilians in the private sector but by civilians working on a specific gov't project. We the people are the gov't and we give responsibility for those weapons use to elected officials. All small arms on the other﻿ hand are developed by private citizens in the private sector, who then compete and sell their design to the military and LE for use. Big difference.

The Constitution doesn't say "small arms;"﻿ it says "arms." Do you have a reading disorder?

So what is your syllogism? That you have a right to own nuclear bombs﻿ and tanks, because those are "arms" ("military ordinance") too? Are you gun duds entirely incapable of formulating a cogent response to these glaring gaps in reasoning?

Again, you mean "it's." And again, are you seriously arguing that you have a right to own nuclear bombs and ICBMs because France and Britain have nuclear arms and ICBMs? Are you just an idiot, or are you simply﻿ typing without thinking (or mindlessly repeating your right-wing radio bullshit)?

To extend your logic your opinion would also apply to the 1A in the following: when drafting the first amendment the founding fathers meant freedom of the press in ONLY newspapers, which makes it inapplicable to modern day forms of "freedom of the press" such as the internet, TV, etc. There is no diff. between these guns,﻿ other than one looks "cooler." BTW if you are really ready to educate yourself on this issue here is the best website for it: assaultweapon (dot) info/

I don't think they﻿ look "cooler." I think they look like the overcompensation of idiots with serious inferiority complexes. Do they make you feel "tough"? And the Founders didn't mean "only newspapers," although that was certainly a component. They could stand on a soap box and speak then as well as we can now. And just as with the right to free speech, the Founders envisioned limits to all rights granted, including the right of well regulated militias to bear arms. None are absolute.

Holy cow Jopaz! Troll much? I really had to search to find your response to mine since you appear to be blowing up the web with your rhetoric. Why don't you log off of it then and go stand on a soap box﻿ instead, as it would unhypocritically apply to your argument. I don't think they look "cooler" either, but Feinstein does, as do all other gun-ban advocates. That was my point exactly. Please before you do anything else go to: assaultweapon (dot) info And then we can have an educated debate.

I never quoted you on any of those.﻿ I placed individual words in double apostrophes--that's not a quote; that's word emphasis. And obviously I cannot "view" right-wing radio, although I can read its transcription from all the things you write. It seems to go from ear to fingers with some of the people on here, and no neural synapses between.

It's much easier to kill with a bushmaster than a knife. Do I really need to explain that to you? Should you be allowed to carry a nuke in a suitcase, because otherwise only bad guys will have nukes in suitcases? Stop spouting right-wing radio﻿ nonsense, and actually think about these simple concepts. If a ten year old can grasp them, what is wrong with you? The fewer guns sold, the fewer guns there are for everyone to get--including criminals. Our murder rate is WAY above other nations.

The D.C. gun ban, enacted in 1976, prohibited anyone﻿ other than law-enforcement officers from carrying a firearm in the city. Residents were even barred from keeping guns in their homes for self-defense.
The gun ban had an unintended effect: It emboldened criminals because they knew that law-abiding District residents were unarmed and powerless to defend themselves. Violent crime increased after the law was enacted,

Since the gun ban was struck down, murders in the District have steadily gone down, from 186 in 2008 to 88 in 2012, the lowest number since﻿ the law was enacted in 1976. The decline resulted from a variety of factors, but losing the gun ban certainly did not produce the rise in murders that many might have expected.

You're a troll, and probably a gun-toting criminal yourself. I live in Massachusetts, and I'm a law student. ﻿

And you really refuse﻿ to see that what I was doing was, too, "word emphasis"? And in fact, you cannot read any radio transcription "from all the things [I] write" because I didn't post anything from radio-that part was simply a figment of your imagination. Your denial of your own hypocrisy is outstanding.

It was "word emphasis" what you wrote? You didn't put single words in quotation marks, you created entire imaginary quotes out of thin air. And I'm the one operation on my imagination? On what planet do you﻿ spend the majority of your time?

I'm afraid you're the one without a shred of common sense, resorting to inventing your﻿ own quotes, and then trying to argue that I did the same thing.

Shame on YOU. I wrote letters﻿ to the President when I was a child as well, and I would be honored if they were actually read. This child has more wisdom than all the gun loons in this country combined.

According to﻿ the story itself China did not release how many people died in that incident. If the logic is a quantification of how many people died then we by that logic should ban cars since they kill far more people daily than any guns do daily.

Reminds me of those teachers that exploited their students to get Obama elected the first time. Spent class time making campaign posters, singing﻿ Obama praise songs, and creating Obama dances.

The Jews in Germany found that out the hard way that it can happen. A Democracy that was dully elected and then said that people did not need their guns because the government would protect them has happened dozens of times in the last century. Those same countries later went on a killing spree﻿ that topes over 100 million. I do not want to add the USA to that list.

Guns are used everyday to protect people and stop crimes. The only answer for a bad guy with a gun is a good﻿ guy with a gun, PERIOD. Law abiding citizens have the right to﻿ defend themselves.﻿ It's that simple.
Remember that when seconds count, the police are at best minutes away. Usually the police try, but most of the﻿ time all they can do is clean up and investigate. Also﻿ the police are under no legal obligation to risk their lives for us, and unfortunately often don't.

Guard dogs more friendly than frightening when put to the test (VIDEO)By Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Tue, Nov 13, 2012Tweet0
Not the best home security system (WHAS11)An unintentionally hilarious investigation into the effectiveness of guard dogs finds that if you're a loving pet owner, your dog probably can't be counted on to stop intruders.
CBS Atlanta teamed up with some local dog owners and a professional dog trainer to see if burglars have much, if anything, to fear. The station enlisted the help of Jeff Schettler, who runs the Georgia K9 National Training Center.
Schettler dressed in a 40-pound protective suit and entered each dog owner's home, simulating a burglary. And unfortunately for the dog owners, had Schettler been a real criminal, he would have made it out safely in every single attempt.
"Even when they are in their own home, they can be a bit nervous," he told the station.
And even when they aren't nervous, they might just be downright friendly. For example, Star, a 10-pound papillon mix, let Schettler cradle her in his arms and carry her outside the home.
The other guard dogs in the test included a 38-pound Brittany spaniel named

Nancy Pelosi: New Democratic caucus most diverse in ‘history of civilized government’By Chris Moody, Yahoo! NewsPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Nov 13, 2012Tweet0

WASHINGTON, D.C.—After Republicans dominated midterm House elections two years ago, Democrats sent only nine new members to that year's congressional freshmen orientation. Lost among their 87 excited Republican colleagues, the small group was nicknamed the "Noble Nine," and went largely unnoticed.
That's not the case this year, as a new crop of 44 Democratic House members arrived on Capitol Hill for the first time.
The new class of fresh-faced Democrats came together for their first public appearance on Tuesday, taking several minutes to file in behind House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. They squeezed together onstage in the Capitol Visitor Center, filling it with bodies from end to end.
"Look at this," Pelosi marveled, as the new gang worked to find a way to all fit onstage. "That length of time it took for our new members to come onto the platform here is music to my ears."
Pelosi touted the diversity of the new caucus, which grew to nearly 200 Democrats after last Tuesday's

Kittens transfixed watching tennis (VIDEO)By Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Tue, Nov 13, 2012Tweet0

In what is an important addition to the Cute Animals Watching Television canon, a video of a pair of kittens transfixed by a women's tennis match has made its way to YouTube.
The kittens, hanging out on a scratching post, appear to be hanging on every stroke in the match, punctuated by what sounds like No. 1-ranked Victoria Azarenka's signature shrieks.
Unlike some of her opponents, the kittens seem to be unfazed by the noise.
Because the camera is fixed on the felines, it's unclear which match they are watching—setting the video apart from other pet-channel-surfing clips. In the video below, for example, a 3-month-old golden retriever is videotaped while watching "Air Buddies," a 2006 film about five golden retriever pups that set out to rescue their kidnapped parents.
That video has been viewed more than 4.5 million times on YouTube:

Man who helped Sandy victims wins $100,000 scratch-off lotteryBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Nov 13, 2012Tweet0

John Turner, a 38-year-old Newark native who returned to New Jersey to help victims of superstorm Sandy, bought a lottery ticket while back home—and won $100,000.
Turner, who lives in the Chicago area and runs National Catastrophe Solutions, a Chicago-based water cleanup service, drove 17 hours from the Windy City to the storm-ravaged Garden State last week. On Nov. 4, Turner bought several scratch-off lottery tickets at a Neptune, N.J., convenience store. One of them—a "Championship Poker" ticket—was a $100,000 winner.
"Just shock," Turner told CBSNewYork.com of his reaction to the jackpot. "Like, this is not happening. This is not real."
State lottery officials, though, confirmed the good karma.
"We are very grateful that John has given his time and skills to help the people dealing with the challenges brought on by Sandy," New Jersey's lottery director said in a statement, "and that New Jersey is giving a memorable thank you back to him."
Turner, who will collect $70,000 after taxes, plans to invest the money in his business and a local church, and to donate some to a family in need.
He plans to return to help the Sandy-stricken tri-state area soon.
"We saw houses moved down the streets, vehicles turned over," he told ABC's Chicago affiliate. "Some people didn't have insurance coverage. Some people never would have expected this. ... It's a saddening situation. We hope they get back to normal as quickly as possible."

Obama campaign chief’s future: Italy, red wineBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Nov 13, 2012Tweet0
Jim Messina, you just steered an embattled incumbent president to re-election despite a sour economy! Are you going to Disney World?
Pshaw, says the Obama campaign manager. "I'm going to go to Italy and figure out how to become an expert on red wine for a couple of weeks," said Messina, underlining that he was now "a member of the public, in the private sector."
Messina's comments came as he walked briskly out of the White House on Tuesday after labor union and progressive leaders met with President Barack Obama. When asked if he'd seen the president, Messina said only, "Take care, guys."
The visit came as many political observers wonder what will happen to the massive Obama campaign machine that Messina oversaw. After the 2008 campaign, it became the president's grass-roots lobbying apparatus and then morphed back into Obama for America when he formally declared his bid for a second term in early 2011. Campaign aides said last week that the fate of the unprecedented political

TSA says yes to snow globes, reserves right to inspect cakes and piesBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Nov 13, 2012Tweet0

Finally, some good news for people who plan to board airplanes carrying cakes, pies or snow globes.
The Transportation Security Administration released on Tuesday updated tips for the millions of travelers expected to fly this holiday season.
According to the TSA's newly released guidelines, snow globes may now be carried on:
TSA allows small snow globes in carry-on luggage when packed in a passenger's plastic 3-1-1 bag. Snow globes that appear to contain less than 3.4 ounces (approximately tennis-ball size) will be permitted if the entire snow globe, including the base, is able to fit in the same one clear, plastic, quart-sized, resealable bag as a passenger's other liquids.
Far more important, pies and cakes are allowed on—but the TSA reserves the right to inspect them:
Food items such as pies and cakes are permitted, but may require further inspection. If travelers are not sure if a food item is considered a liquid or gel it is best to pack the item in checked baggage or ship it to a destination in advance.
Also, gift-wrapped presents are allowed as carry-on items, though not recommended:
In order to determine if the contents of a package are a threat, a security officer may need to unwrap and inspect the item.
The updated travel tips are part of the TSA's attempt to streamline the lines at security checkpoints. As part of that initiative, the TSA modified its screening procedures in March to cut down on the number of pat-downs for passengers aged 12 and younger, and 75 and older—though it did not eliminate them entirely.

White House: ‘Up to Congress’ whether Petraeus testifies on BenghaziBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Nov 13, 2012Tweet0
Holly Petraeus and Gen. David Petraeus walk past a seated Paula Broadwell (rear right) at his confirmation hearing as CIA director in June 2011. (Cliff Owen/AP)The White House said Tuesday that it was "up to Congress" whether to call former CIA Director David Petraeus to testify about the Sept. 11 attack in Benghazi, Libya.
"Congress [makes] decisions about who is called to testify," press secretary Jay Carney told reporters at his daily briefing.
The Intelligence Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives had been set to hear from Petraeus about the attack on the American compound in separate closed-door hearings on Thursday. But aides to both panels indicated that the retired Army general would be replaced by Mike Morrell, the acting CIA director.
"The president is confident that Acting Director Morrell is fully informed and capable of representing the CIA in a hearing about the incidents in Benghazi," Carney said.
Still, key senators have made it clear that Petraeus, whose shocking resignation came after the public disclosure of an extramarital affair, will ultimately need to be heard. The attack claimed the lives of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

Why The Signal won the election forecasting gameBy David Rothschild & Chris Wilson | The Signal – Tue, Nov 13, 2012Tweet0
There are two questions to ask when evaluating a political prediction, whether it's from Nate Silver, a pollster, an academic or your favorite Yahoo News predictions blog:
A)    How useful was the prediction the day before the election?
B)    How useful was the prediction the day after the election?
A great deal of attention is devoted to scoring the performance of various seers and prognosticators on Point A. The Signal went 50 for 51 in that regard, getting every state correct except Florida—of course it was Florida—in our last prediction before voters went to the polls. (We might humbly point out that our original prediction, announced in February, was precisely the same as the one we made on Nov. 5.)
Evaluating Point B is trickier. Have forecasters like Silver, who relies primarily on aggregating polls, taught us anything about how elections work and what motivates voters?
While polls do offer some insight into how public opinion responds to high-profile events—though always at a delay of at least a day—they're powerless to reveal the high-level factors, such as the economy, that influence elections months and even years ahead of time. That's why The Signal prefers to start with models, like the one we debuted in February: It teaches us which factors correlate with election results and which do not.
The 2012 election validated three main insights in our model:

Petraeus is defense secretary in new ‘Call of Duty’ gameBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Tue, Nov 13, 2012Tweet0
David Petraeus is the secretary of defense in the new Call of Duty game (Activision)Former CIA Director David Petraeus is still reeling from a recently revealed extramarital affair that may have national security repercussions, but in the video game world things are going much better for the retired four-star general.
In the new "Call of Duty: Black Ops II" game released on Tuesday, Petraeus is the newly appointed secretary of defense in the year 2025.
And that's not the only unusual bit of predicted future developments in the game from creators Activision and Treyarch. When we first meet Petraeus, he's aboard the USS Barack Obama.
Several high-profile actors have lent their talents to previous "Call of Duty" video game installments. As Kotaku reports, Petraeus in the game is voiced by actor Jim Meskimen.
Petraeus also reportedly displays some phoenix-worthy resurrection skills in the game. Early on, he is aboard Marine One with the fictional President Bosworth, a dead ringer for Hillary Clinton, when terrorists shoot down the aircraft. However, both the president and Petraeus survive the attack.
Video game developers are known to retroactively make substantial changes to their characters and plots, even after titles are released to the public. So, it will be interesting to see if Petraeus remains in the game, or is scrubbed through a software update as his real-life personal scandal continues to dominate the news headlines.

Small plane overshoots runway in Sao PauloBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Nov 13, 2012Tweet0

A small corporate jet overshot the runway while attempting to land at the Congonhas Airport in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Sunday.
The captain and his two passengers survived the crash, but the captain  suffered serious injuries. Footage shows the jet landing on a field and then skidding into a concrete barrier a short distance from a busy street. Fortunately, the airplane, a twin-engine Cessna 525B Citation, according to Australia's Herald Sun, did not catch fire.
In 2007, a much larger jet overran the same runway and crashed into a warehouse, resulting in the deaths of everyone on board and several people on the ground. The deadly accident sparked anger over the airport's perceived lack of safeguards.

Washington state ponders next moves in marijuana standoffBy Scott Bomboy | National Constitution Center – Wed, Jan 23, 2013

Washington state officials are dealing with new issues as they discuss a resolution to their state’s conflict with the federal government over legalized marijuana. But the state remains committed to legalization.

Newly sworn-in Governor Jay Inslee was in the nation’s capital on Tuesday to meet with Attorney General Eric Holder and Justice Department officials about his state’s decriminalization of recreational marijuana use.
After the meeting, Inslee said the state was moving forward with making rules about growing, processing and selling marijuana, under very controlled circumstances.
Washington state and Colorado both legalized pot in November 2012 voter referendums that seemingly violate federal laws.
In November, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper reportedly spoke with Holder about the same issue on a phone call.
Voters in the two states chose to legalize it for recreational use following 18 states that approved it for medical use.
The marijuana issue is complicated, since the federal government considers marijuana (both medical and recreational) a Schedule 1 controlled substance that is illegal. But it also doesn’t have the financial and human resources to arrest marijuana users in Washington state and Colorado.
So while federal law is designed to trump state law when it comes to marijuana use, the reality is that the two sides will need to reach some type of compromise.
Leaders like Inslee and Hickenlooper are pressing the Justice Department to file a lawsuit or to define which parts of the federal laws they plan to enforce.
Inslee, a Democrat, said during his election campaign that he didn’t support legalization, but he would honor the voters’ wishes as governor.
Now, as governor, Inslee is facing several offshoots of the federal-state legal conflict that are problematic.
Earlier this week, two stories highlighted legal wrinkles in allowing recreational marijuana use in conjunction with federal resources.
In one instance, farmers in Washington have been running into problems if they want to grow marijuana as a cash crop: The agricultural research they need may come from state universities that get federal funds.
Also, recreational marijuana is posing an interesting problem at ski resorts, which pose to benefit from an influx of newly interested tourists. Many ski resorts in Washington and Colorado use federally owned land, says the website On the Snow, and the Justice Department has made it clear that pot use won’t be tolerated on federal property.
David Cronheim, an attorney who specializes in skiing legal issues, told On the Snow that the federal law rules supreme when it comes to marijuana use on the slopes.
“Where state law conflicts with federal law, the federal law controls. That’s known as the supremacy clause,” said Cronheim. “Personally, from a lawyer’s perspective, I think it’s a dangerous proposition when states try to nullify federal law. We fought a civil war over that.”

Neither Colorado nor Washington’s law allows public marijuana use, either through smoking or internal consumption.
Officials in Washington state were scheduled to have their first public meeting on Tuesday night to discuss how to draw up rules about public marijuana sales.
On Monday, Washington state officials said they expected to exercise close control over the cultivation and processing of marijuana, in order to avoid conflict with federal authorities.
Washington’s Liquor Control Board will regulate the process.
Marijuana advocates also received a court defeat on Tuesday when a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., rejected a petition to remove the substance from the list of Schedule 1 controlled substances.
Medical marijuana groups had filed the petition, which was earlier rejected in 2011 by the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Just legalize Marjuana already! Doesn't the government have bigger problems than people smoking a harmless plant? Get your priorities straight!

The state legalized it. This is the USA still (barely). End of discussion. Hopefully the feds will mature on this issue faster than they have since the 30's when the plant was made illegal. Strictly due to racism, greed, and ignorance- not health

These are the last days of prohibition. The feds can fight it all the way back to their bunker in Berlin if they so choose, but they know they've already lost.

Who gives a #$%$? I smoke almost everyday and it's not legal for anything in my state. People are going to do what they want to no matter what the state or federal government has to say about it. Always have, always will!

Washington’s "Liquor Control Board" will regulate the process, cultivation and processing of marijuana & make rules about public marijuana sales. Umm,, that would be a ironic team. Big Alcohol doesnt like competition.

That is the problem? They don't want smokers on the slopes? That's hysterical. Any excuse to delay giving millions of law abiding citizens more instead of restricting it. People are still going to find a quiet trail, smoke a bone and get right back out there. No harm, no foul.

I think we should go into both houses of congress with bongs. Then blow shotguns all over the place. Just think not only would pot become legal but we would get a balanced budget and they would bring back twinkes. Half way to world peace. FREE THE WEED

A bunch of red-herring issues were illlustrated. The ski resorts are likely on private property- let the Feds enforce on slopes where people shouldn't be skiing high anyhow. And most growers do not need ag research from universities to grow- individuals figured that out on their own.

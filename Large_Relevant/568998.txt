All gun laws are Illegal as they are an infringement any other interpretation is an excuse for government powers to grow & liberty to fade. Stalin Total gun ban "Real power comes from a Long rifle."

No president would stoop so low as to use children or disabled people to try and push some commie bull**** on the American people.﻿ That would be as dumb as selling military weapons to drug cartels or giving the mooselimb brotherhood F16's and Abrams tanks! The USA would never elect a buffoon that stupid! That would be like hiring a mooselimb to defend your embassy in a anti USA country! This must be one of those photo shopped videos!

What a fucking retards these Obama suckers. Has anyone ever realized this guy is trowing bombs from Drones on Whole Families and﻿ hundreds of children have died.
And now he want's to protect the beautiful innocent American children.
How retarded are the sheeple.
That's the only good thing about this, seeing the sheeple get fucked up in the ass for the coming future.

Listen people. THIS IS NOT ABOUT WEAPONS. THIS IS ABOUT DESTROYING THE CONSTITUTION ULTIMATELY GETTING RID OF THE CONSTITUTION ONCE AND FOR ALL. Its not about assault weapons because People can create their own﻿ semi-automatic laser burning, flame throwing, acid spraying, biomechanical weapons all of which could cause more havoc and devastation to schools all over the united states. THE REASON FOR THESE ATTACKS ON OUR CONSTITUTION IS TO GET THE PEOPLE TO AGREE TO GIVE UP ALL THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS.

Just because you're a retard doesn't mean the rest of the world is. The Iraq people made I.E.Ds which causes more devastation than assault rifles. Don't be a silly person, we have good and bad people in the government. Good people will expose these selfish globalist﻿ agendas. We will stand by the Constitution and say NOT HERE IN AMERICA!

If the government has all the guns, you﻿ won't have freedom for long.
EVERY government eventually gets corrupted, bad people take over and they kill innocent people within the country.
Within the last 100 years alone, governments have killed over 200 million innocent people within their own country and that is not including wars.
The 2nd Amendment is so we all have guns as a last line of defense against tyranny.

i think that the 2nd ammendment will be upheld. The republicans and democrats are working hard in collaboration to decieve and take higher share over us. By share I mean taxes. They went up, and went up bigtime with penalties and audits in record numbers. If we had good leadership a simple idea like having a police officer/sheriff sponsor a person that wants to own a﻿ gun or gun(s) being classified as assault weapons AT low cost like a fishing license.

It's not the gun, it's the person HOLDING﻿ the gun. while i do agree you shouldn't be able to own assault riffles or grenade launchers, you can't just ban guns. criminals don't pay attention to laws, and will buy them from black markets. and with a ban, if gunned-criminals invade a home, citizens will have no way to defend themselves. i think you should only be able to own a rifle, shotgun, or handgun. and you need a criminal background check to be able to own one. crack down on black markets too

Do not talk about Obama like that. You just mad because he is smarter than most of you dip shit Americans. All you do is live off the government, get your check, and get fatter and fatter and fatter. At least he is doing something about it.
Then maybe your little gangbanger thug children and crazy white people won't shoot up the block anymore killing babies, kids, and people that haven't lived their life yet. Obama stands for you and u don't even show him the respect. Stop the violence. No﻿ guns

Who do you think supports the debt and spending that keeps all the "fat" Americans on welfare!? Lol. Who do you think supports abortion which kills 3,300 unborn babies PER DAY! Rifles kill 1 per day. Swimming pools kill more children across America than guns do. 38 per day are killed from drunk driving. In one﻿ post you support big government "taking care of you", and in another post you're criticizing those same people taking care of you. You can't be serious.

The English haven't banned all guns. And when they talk about banning the him they're not talking about getting rid of guns. They're deciding who gets them. The police. The military. The connected. They'll always have guns. It's the proles who wont have them. Much neater for the﻿ rulers that way don't you know...

Please tell me how basing your policy on the ideas of an innocent child that has no concept of what the real world is like (thankfully)﻿ is a good idea? Would you base how you choose to protect your family by going to you 8 year old? They do not understand the complexities of the world, of the issue at hand, and of the history and founding of the nation.Should we hear them when they choose to speak, definitely. Should we exploit them for a political agenda then know nothing about, no!

Actually, a .50 cal sniper rifle can not kill as many people as a hand gun yet it is far more powerful. It depends on the bullet on what it is designed to do. A hollow point is designed to stop and kill a person. The .223 round﻿ (what is used in the Ar-15) is designed to injure, not kill. When in battle, you want to injure an enemy because then it takes 1-2 people to remove him from the battlefield. Hence you have cause 3 people to leave the fight. A lesson since you know nothing of guns.

Good luck with your glock and assault rifle versus the U.S. air force and navy. The European nations invaded during world war 2 couldn't even stop Nazi occupation, you really﻿ think having a select number of armed American households is going to defeat a tyrannical America?

Yep, because the﻿ poor farmers had no success against the greatest military in the the world during the revolution. Afghanistan had no success fighting the Russians, and us with their puny weapons. And of course there was no success in Libya, Egypt, and Syria when the people fought against their government. Now, that will hopefully never need to happen here. But you can not say that it would have no effect if it ever did happen.

And the 2nd Amendment isnt for "hunting" or "sport" its too keep Americans free, thats why it was written. As a constitutional law professor id expect you to know this Mr Obama

You're﻿ right! He absolutely does not, assault rifles have been banned for civilian manufacture since 1984, and unless u have a special license and $20,000 you cant have one.
The proper term for the ar-15 is modern sporting rifle, cause thats what it is

The media also needs to learn the difference between a full auto machine gun and a semi auto rifle. By calling them﻿ "military style assault weapons" and saying they fire 100rounds per minute, they are trying to trick people. Only machine guns fire hundreds of rounds of minute, its called the cycling rate. A semi auto fires 1 bullet per pull of the trigger.
As someone who has fired both full auto and semi auto theres a huge difference. Most of these anti gunners never fired a gun in their life!

A person should own a gun for at least one of three reasons. Hunting, self-defense or target shooting. Hunting: you do not need a ar. The animal doesn't have hands; you have a gun. A shotgun/pistol would end with the same results. An ar is not necessary. For self defense, your viewpoint is that everyone should be able to have ar in order﻿ to protect themselves. This allows everyone to get weapons as well. Why not have no ar? In all recent shootings, all guns have been attained legally. Ur view?

Based on the ratings of these videos, it﻿ has also disgusted them. I'm pretty sure that more than a few of the "thumbs" down ratings are actually from disenchanted Democrats who may have supported Mr. Sotero the first time around.

When a man does it, it makes him look like little bitch that . I could give an owl's fart about his religion or his place of birth.

For what LEGITIMATE reason would anyone have to flag this video? Because they don't﻿ like the views expressed? Last I checked, that's not a LEGITIMATE reason. How does it infringe upon the rights of anyone? Last I checked, there is no right "not to be offended" or "not to be disgusted". When I quote Voltaire by saying "I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it." I actually mean it. The video itself does not infringe on anyone's rights.

Say what you will, but the fact is, these children wrote these words. It's how they feel. I don't doubt the President is playing a little chess here, but when your fighting a force of evil, you have to use every weapon in your arsenal. Sadly, many disallow themselves to see President Obama's greatest and most powerful weapon: LOVE. Think about what almost happened to the country hence globally almost the second there was a change in power. There's no such thing﻿ as coincidence.

Only a republican would consider children expressing themselves, after so many children were massacred at school, sickening. Your NRA republicans are exploiting the president's children in﻿ order to sell more high powered mega clip weapons of mass murder.
Its not unconstitutional to amend the constitution unless NRA financed republicans want to sell more weapons designed for mass murder.

An amendment to the Constitution is an improvement, a correction or a revision to the original content approved. Twenty seven Amendments have been approved, six have been disapproved and thousands have been﻿ discussed. If the 220 year old 2nd amendment isn't updated within a few decades. Felons, psychos and brainless power obsessed bulletheads will have the ability to murder thousands at one time, instead of only hundreds. What a shame that will be, for a republican.

There has never been anything added to the second amendment since it was written because it is complete and concise.
To make an amendment to the constitution requires ratification from three fourths of the states. It's not something a president can legally do and it's not something that can be done on﻿ a whim.

I'm not suggesting amending the 2nd Amendment. Times change, and laws need to change with the times.﻿ Otherwise we'll all eventually be murdered by weapons that continue to be more efficient tools of mass murder. The 2nd Amendment puts no limitations on weapons or who posses weapons. Only a wooden headed dolt would believe America should be saddled to an already antiquated sentence for the rest of time.

The second amendment was included so we could protect ourselves from tyranny.

I am no republican... my voter registration card reads democrat. I voted for Obama, yet I am being very turned off by what I am seeing. The original ten amendments to the constitution were promised rights... rights that allow us﻿ to be free. I hate it when politicians stamp on any of them, regardless of their party affiliations. Actually, Obama/Biden are probably the best gun salesmen of all time, considering that people who had no interest in ARs are running out to buy them without research.

Your post is going to generate even more cognitive fog in that little brain of his. His thinking is so binary. He has a 'ballgame' mentality -- you're either for one or the other. ﻿ I was going to bring up the fact that I know blue collar Union guys who consider themselves Democrats but are pro-gun all they way, but you did a much better job of explaining.

Republicans live in fear of the big bad government (as if government is a person in control of the military planning to kill Americans). Democrats know that psychos, felons, gang bangers, and brainless bullethead rednecks with weapons designed for mass murder are far more dangerous than the﻿ government. If "the government" wanted to kill us all, it would only take a matter of minutes to do it. You bulletheads would have no affect on the outcome of our certain demise.

I wonder why this child didn't make the video?
2 Year Old Shoots Home Intruder
Deputies say, the girl was home alone when a man she'd never seen before, rang the front doorbell. They say when no one answered the door, the man went around to the back of the house and kicked a door open. That's when authorities say,﻿ the girl grabbed a gun and hid in a bathroom closet.
If it saves only one child it's worth it. Right?

The guy is using children to push his disarmament agenda. This is an adult discussion. Of course the president cares about kids except the ones that get aborted.
The president has attacked out Bill of Rights. A hostile and punitive act﻿ directed at people he sees as irrelevant. He sees our founding principles as something to be overcome instead of treasured. Disarmament is the hallmark of Communism. Power corrupts. Absolute Power corrupts absolutely. God help us. The man is using children.

Maybe we should focus on educating children, i.e. repair our failing public education system, than fill them with fear and use them as political puppets to spew a policy that flies in the face of all logic and statistics i.e. that banning semi-automatic weapons and the ever shrinking number that supposedly﻿ defines a high capacity magazine.

This is a joke. Most likely written for the kid by a parent or even the government. Hand chosen to promote the gun band agenda. If you truly care about the opinion of children, lets really get a comprehensive representation of their view. Last time I﻿ checked, children don't get a vote, adults do. Your focus should be on the budget situation, your own excessive spending, and our out of control taxes. I'm short $200 extra each paycheck as compared to last year. Shame on you!

Nope. It's called "being observant". It's a skill common among those of us with﻿ some street sense and damn near non-existent among clueless herbs like yourself. There will be no happy ending to this current state of affairs from where I see it. Happy endings occur only in movies and massage parlors.
At least AJ's propaganda is more entertaining and, dare I say it -- more realistic than anything that comes from a follower of Barry the well-spoken Step-n-Fetchit house negro.

No, you can't. Your mindset proves that. My views come from actual experiences (many of which would've eaten you cotton candy ass alive) and observations of human interaction. Your views come almost 100% from what someone else told you. You obviously haven't experience or lived much. I was once believed﻿ as you did in my teens and early 20s.

Are you kidding me? This guy is using a child who obviously doesn't know anything about the Constitution or anything at all about this issue to﻿ promote gun control? Obama is pathetic, just absolutely pathetic.

The 2nd amendment isn't the Constitution, its an antiquated sentence added to the Constitution 220 years ago. It wasn't meant to allow felons, psychos, and brainless bulletheads to terrorize neighborhoods with high powered automatic﻿ weapons of mass murder.
- These children are reading a letters of fear and concern that they wrote themselves. Are teachers in school using children for propaganda when they read papers they wrote in school?

Exactly the point of the 2nd amendment was there for the inevitable eventuality of the fact that our government would corrupt and it would be﻿ the duty of the people if the United States to abolish and replace it or put it back in its place. Therefore every time the government passes a law banning guns or something of that nature it gives the government more power and one day we will be a filed police state. :( thanks King Barak!

So, basically, you're saying children can't possibly have opinions about this, even if they have no idea what the Constitution is? I'm sure﻿ if he knew what the Constitution is, he /still/ would want something done about gun control.

If you bullethead teabaggers could comprehend the Constitution you would know that the second amendment is not the Constitution. Its a one antiquated sentence amendment to the Constitution written 220 years ago. It needs to be amended again or soon you﻿ bulletheads will be able to massacre thousands of men, women, and children, at a time instead of only hundreds.

If us "bulletheads" lost our guns 1st if the government said "I want your gun" it would go completely and there would be TONS of bloodshed 2nd If the government succeeded in the removal of guns then only criminals would have guns and therefore there would be MUCH MUCH more bloodshed because no one would﻿ be able to defend themselves.

The problem of gun violence in America is a direct result of drug prohibition. Ninety-five percent of all gun incidents are drugs/gang related. End the obscenely corrupt policy of prohibition, which in reality is a government subsidy to organised crime, & the crime rate will plummet. Tax & sell marijuana like alcohol & the tax revenues would pay for mental health services. People need to wake up & realise the problem is not gun ownership, its denying people the right to chose their own﻿ medicine.

I don't understand why people﻿ don't want the gun law to change, when it is dangerous for people. In Europe and other world continents, it isn't﻿ easy to find places where you can buy guns easily. For the safety of people, the gun law must change. Only those who are criminals are against it.

This is all staged!. A cowardly dictator hiding behind children. Hitler did the same thing in the early 30s. What started the night of the Long knives. He staged elaborate terrorist attacks! Burn down buildings and said, look, it was them!. If you turn over more power to me. Like, say, national gun registration! Will make Germany﻿ the safest country in the world!!!

Now is the time, yes but, for debate, sincere talk from all sides, 'reasonableness,' but, imo it is not time to shove it down the Middleclasse's throat while there are also record number of guns in the wrong﻿ hands, it'd cost a fortune, many point out people will die in the process, possibly many if not done well,﻿ since there is no conscensus yet with the will of the people.
It's not time for top-down DICTAT orders, when 91% of the people have NO﻿ TRUST IN CONGRESS. Bad mistake, imo, if done so.

Humankind didn't just come into being by accident of some meaningless molecular mush being hit by random chaotic lighting strikes, as if in some primitive science lab.
Humankind, male and female, came into being﻿ for a purpose: to Love eachother, worship and serve God, in so doing.
This also means respecting other people, even if you disagree vehemently with them, and, seeking the truth about reality.It means *really* protecting the kids and, the people. It means serious debate not trivial BS.

I say the former, as to cosmogenesis problem in philosphy, because, it is actually related to 'modern political theory.' If you believe that a human is but a glorified ape evolved from mush, with no soul, no Creator, than, you imply he has﻿ no more value than an ape or molecular mush by some Hawaiian Island, offshore by an undersea volacano, in the so called, primordial ooze.
If you believe, otoh, that people were made in God's Image, you don't murder a school class of children,or rob an old lady

You remember the 6th Commandment of the Decalouge given to Moses, by SOMEONE, it is told, if you are not already into the first two commandments, ( not petty request from God but, Commandments) to Love God and neighbor, in which case you won't murder them. See? It's very logical, critical philophical thinking; Dawkinites in the mockery of God﻿ and Christians pose and pretend to have a patent on, when they are absurdly emotional and unreasonable; many of them, with some exceptions of civil ones.

imo they are ﻿ intentionally giving Obama bad advice to divide the nation. He has to watchout and use greatest discernment now as to who he listens to and, their exact motives, without blindly trusting in them, in this world of Karl Rove style Machiavellian political theatrics full of liars, judas's and jokers.
At worse, they will get some crazy to attempt to kill Obama, or succeed. they will just replace him, the war-machine that is. I guess Biden would get a stroke, then Kerry is in office.

..because, Mrs Clinton got a stroke, as you all know and is out of consideration of the presidency, for now, anyhow, possibly﻿ for good: we don't know.
So, then they have Kerry in place and, I don't know if they want him there either, so what happens after that is anyone's guess.
My only consolation is God knows. Not even the NSA knows that one, I bet, you see.
Trust in God, not the finite power of men.

A good place to start taking firearms out the 'wrong hands,' as you say, Congress, would be to start with the various international mafia, new violent drug gangs like Zeta﻿ M13, paranoi G Sachs traders celebrating their 'record bonuses' the US taxpayers gave them, who were arming themselves with 9mm against imaginary assailants, probably high on cocaine, whisky and prozac themselves to control their trader angst, addiction and guilt of being the victimizers of world.

What we need is to eliminate the﻿ gun free zones that the vast majority of mass murderers are done in. We need to allow teachers, school staff, and mature college students, who have the training and are willing to conceal carry guns to do so. And we need to increase detection and treatment for people with Mental Health issues. Also we need to investigate the affects SSRI drugs have in increasing violence and suicides.
We have many out of work Veterans that would be great guards in our schools.

Guns are used everyday to protect people and stop crimes. The﻿ only answer for a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, PERIOD. Law abiding citizens have the right to﻿ defend themselves.﻿ It's that simple.
Remember that when seconds count, the police are at best minutes away. Usually the police try, but most of the﻿ time all they can do is clean up and investigate. Also﻿ the police are under no legal obligation to risk their lives for us, and unfortunately often don't.

Just when you think the Evil can't get any worse, Obama steps it up. This is as sick as it gets..just pure nasty and evil. How could anyone have voted for him﻿ and have any affirmations for justice and truth?

I am appalled that anyone would use a child to try to snatch away our freedom! Even if that child believes what he is saying, there are reasons the legal voting age is eighteen. It is because a child does not have the capacity to comprehend the consequences of certain laws, and actions. No offense, but these children﻿ do not have any idea of the peril that these new gun laws put our nation in. They don't understand tyranny! Stop using babies OBAMA, that is cowardice.

Australia is in the same boat as the U.S.A. , but more so. Tens of thousands of guns were taken in a so-called ''buy back'', it was'nt voluntary, it was compulsory, with heavy fines and confiscation of property if you did'nt hand in a proscribed weapon, or PART of a proscribed weapon!
For the last 8-10 years, Sydney and﻿ it's surrounding suburbs have been plagued by drive-by shootings, all criminal and gang related, yet NO-ONE tells the Police anything, that's why I'm leaving Sydney.

Say that when you are riding the train to the FEMA camps, because you let a few children who read letters, tell you to give the government your guns. In the words of Thomas Jefferson" The beauty of the Second Amendment, is that you will﻿ not need it, until they try and take it." I wish this were a world where guns were not needed, but where there is good so there is evil. Do we let the ones who want to hurt us just do it? Do we lay down at their feet even while they kick us? HELL NO !

Do you know that Christianity﻿ is correct? The world around us reveals that G-d﻿ DOES exist, and the historical evidence reveals that Jesus Christ really did come to this earth and there is overwhelming evidence that Jesus Christ really did physically rise from the dead. Jesus is coming again and the signs﻿ of the end times that were foretold in the Bible are coming to pass.

Its ignorant people like YOU that make our country less safe. The Supreme Court has already stated in the Heller case several years ago that, while affirming the 2nd Amendment, that the government has the right to set rules on what TYPES of weapons and ammunition can be limited or controlled under the Amendment. Certain weapons can be banned. That was Justice SCALIA that wrote that decision,﻿ certainly no friend of gun control. The NRA leadership are Merchants of Death, no more, no less-

because it is to hard for good citizens to get guns and to easy for criminals to get guns. Criminals don't buy guns legally they buy them off the black market which is﻿ relatively easier than legally buying a gun.

Okay, its the gun murder capitol﻿ of the developed world. Its not quite genocide yet, but don't give up hope. In a few decades bulletheads will be carrying weapons that can kill thousands instead of only hundreds.

Who are bulletheads, exactly? You keep mentioning﻿ them. If you are afraid of guns, you have probably never fired one. They can be dangerous, but are actually quite fun. Just like alot of the other freedoms we have that kill people daily, like fast cars, alcohol, cigarettes, etc. If someone is crazy enough to take others peoples lives, they will do it by any means. Timothy McViegh didn't use a gun. Neither did the 9/11 terrorists. And the Sandy Hook asshole used a pistol, not an ar15

Guns don't protect they kill, guns have no other use, but to kill. It may be fun using a tool that's designed to kill, but it has no other practical purpose except to kill people. I prefer not to be a bullethead because people who own guns are much more likely to be killed by﻿ a gun. Anyone who believes that having the power to kill is more important than saving lives is a bullethead.

Here's my proposal: Supposing that you don't live in a gated community with armed guards, why don't you put a sign in your front yard or front door saying "Gun Free Home" or "Gun Free Zone"? I would encourage you and all your like minded friends to do the same. As the economy gets worse, It will divert the attention of Pookie and his homies away from my humble abode and on to yours. I﻿ really don't feel like having to clean up their blood and guts off my walls and carpet.

Yes... but with that tool you can kill a person that would do harm to others. If a teacher or someone was armed at Sandy Hook then maybe instead of 20﻿ or so kids dead maybe only 4 or possibly if we were lucky 0.

The U.S. has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world, but is 28th in the world for gun homicide. Vermont had 1.1 murders per 100,000 (year 2010), and no "assault weapon" ban and no carry permit requirements. D.C. has a carry ban and semi-auto ban, but had a murder rate of 24 per 100,000 (2010). Illinois has almost the same gun laws as D.C., and had 6 murders per﻿ 100,000. California has extremely restrictive gun laws, 5.3 murders per 100,000 (2010). How is gun control working?

The United States has by far the highest per capita rate of all developed countries. According to data compiled by the United Nations, the United States has four times as many gun-related homicides per capita as do Turkey and Switzerland, which are tied for third. The U.S. gun murder rate is about 20 times﻿ the average for all other countries on this chart. That means that Americans are 20 times as likely to be killed by a gun than is someone from another developed country.

Yeah but lets look deeper into the problem. Chicago, Illinois has the toughest gun laws in the nation and it also has the highest number of gun murders in the﻿ nation. Texas (of course) has the easiest and one of the lowest in the nation. The reason we are so high is because of states like California, Illinois, and New York

Plenty of countries have fewer guns, but more gun murders

If you think the US should be disarmed because you have an irrational fear of guns, then move to the UK or Australia where they dumped all their guns out of remorse, without knowing the consequences.

I don't think he realizes he is using the bat the same way a gun is being used (whether it be good or bad the way he said it I can't tell.) and that if guns were made illegal because people﻿ can kill with them than apparently baseball bats have to be banned to.

Yeah can you imagine the outrage if any pro-gun group had a bunch of children reading their letters telling Obama repeal all the current gun laws because they all "infringe" upon the 2nd Amendment & mandate concealed carry in every school in America (like they've done in Israel & haven't had a school shooting since).
Sure the left would flip out, call it gross & disgusting using﻿ little children that way.

Sorry, I didn't understand your last comment. Can you please elaborate.
What was it that you were saying about Israel 's police force?
And I never said Israelis were not able to own guns. What I did imply was that they have armed adults in all﻿ their schools, because they do.
Thank you. Peace.

So let me get this straight...
You point out that Obama and his family have armed body guards protecting them 24/7, and he signed a bill to make sure he has that for the rest of his life...That's racist and wrong because you're bringing his kids into the argument....
But﻿ somehow this is perfectly OK? Just how stupid do you think we are?

I've enjoyed your comment. For what its worth remember that most anti-gun thinking is a form of mental﻿ illness. Not in a "psycho" way, more like a "retardation" way. Its kind of like a 30yr old that'll never reason beyond a 10yrs old. They primarily live in emotion & fantasy. Facts & stats, cause & effect, consequence of action doesn't effect their judgment as much. They react based on fear & peer pressure.
2nd Amendment allows access to "arms" equal to govt in order to guard against tyranny.

I really don't understand this: why does Congess speak about gun control via people control, basically, but, then in action goes and orders millions of more hollowpoint munitions to distribute nationally to an overmilitarized police force. Now, they do not ricochet as much and, hit others in Urban settings, it is claimed but, doctors tell us they mushroom out on impact and make death more likely and﻿ suffering much more. How is that an example of action for non-violence and good will to America?

Then why does he say nothing about the mothly Sandy Hook that occurs in Chicago, his home town? Why does he propose bans that will have absolutly no effect on the safety of children? If he was truly serious then he would be attacking handguns that commit over 70% of the gun crimes while the assault rifle commits 0.25%? Why does he not attack﻿ gang violence that kills more shildren in a year then all the mass killings the past 100 years combined?

Also, children are intelligent, but they are also ignorant and do not understand tall the complexities of the issue. Would you allow an 8 year old to determine how you should protect yourself? Why must we teach children about the dangers of strangers, being alone outside, stove burners, exc? ecause they do not have the experience to﻿ make good decisions on their own. They must learn from either experience or from one who has experienced it.

Yes, Mr. President. Creating﻿ policies that affect the entire country that are based off the views of children who are (thankfully) innocent and know little of th real world they live in. That is a wonderful idea because I know that my children know way more than I do about the concerns of protecting my family and them especially.

Fucking stupid americans. The whole world is gradually losing respect for you again because of your STUPID gun laws. Why the fuck does anybody need an assualt rifle in their house? to protect against others with assualt rifles?﻿ lol IDIOTS . WAKE UP. In the UK there are noo guns. I've never seen one in my life, never heard of any gun crimes in my city.

No laws are﻿ gonna keep guns out of the hands of criminals, you dumb shit. And when our president is a Marxist dictator, we need to be able to defend ourselves. How the hell do you think Hitler got ultimate power? He made guns illegal, and then he ran wild.

Yeah, lets be like the UK and be a﻿ bunch of pansies that are required by lae to flee from an attacker or a burgler if at all possible rather that allowing people to defend themselves and their property. You are soooo enlightened. Lets also remove free speech and make it wrong to offend people. Because that is going to go well for you.

What is your definition of an "assault rifle?" Automatic weapons such as machine guns are illegal in the﻿ USA. The current calls for gun control are proposals to ban weapons on the basis of their appearance rather than their function. See: assaultweapon.info/

This is disgusting and fake. Hitler and Stalin also used children to push their agendas. Obama wants to disarm the country so that we cannot fight back against his tyranny, so he gets kids to ask for our guns to be taken away. Absolutely despicable. Anyone who voted for him should feel like﻿ a complete asshole.

Here in Thailand, kids & adults understand youth are to learn from older more experienced people...
Just because Wall Street is following childish behavior, that doesn't mean children need to set public policy.
Ask kids- if riding your bike & a car stops near, then two men jump out &...
The kid will say find an﻿ adult/police/help...
An experienced adult say's- if attacked, I will defend myself anyway possible(gun is preferable).
Weak adults follow childish acts.

Wow,﻿ emotional manipulation at its worst. If you need little kids to publicly support your policies you're reaching pretty low. These kids have no understanding of these complex political situations and are being used by the state to support its agenda. I suppose Obama thinks these kids should run for Congress since they're so informed on America's priorities. This is disgusting.

It's interesting to﻿ compare the eloquence of the kids to that of some of this video's commenters. The kids clearly have the upper hand.

Yeah, I'm going to let a child's views on gun control sway my stance on the issue. I mean, seeing as how they clearly know all the complexities surrounding the subject. Yeah right. The opinions of children on gun control contribute NOTHING to the conversation because they obviously lack the maturity and intelligence. And if they can't contribute to the conversation, the only logical remaining reason to use them is but to serve as props for a political agenda. Mr. President, you're disgusting.﻿

No one needs attack weapons. I am not against guns but stopping gun shows from selling to people with out back ground checks is a good thing and responsible. There is no reason to not keep up with all guns just like we do cars. The second amendment will be fine. I have never seen so much hate.﻿ Very disconcerting.

Liberal parents and﻿ teachers coercing and cajoling kids to write letters, just﻿ so they can be exploited by 0bama. Hiding behind children just doesn't cut it.
It's a real shame that we don't have a real news media to call BS on these shenanigans.

Birds of a feather. You must be a hired gun for the gun lobby or work directly there. The NRA got less than one percent return on what they spent this last election and the President has his highest approval ratings right now. Us in the middle will no longer let the teandethals and the like push us around. We need commonsense rules and regulations for﻿ all. This is not the wild wild west. Do you really want the rest of the world looking at us that way. We are about truth and justice.

Thanx for showing everyone you don't have﻿ a single. The truth is obama doesn't have any support on this issue including from his own party which is why he uses executive orders like a little bitch because he can't get his way any other way. Same thing with healthcare, no support so he ram rodded a bill through congress with his majority vote like a cryin little bitch. I'm not worried though, gun control won't pass and we will nullify obamacare in my state. (cont)

I gotta laugh at people like you who are all up in arms over the issue of guns...where were you before obama got you all riled up over guns??? I'm betting you weren't on the internet calling for gun control. You weren't making signs and﻿ protesting against guns in your city. You didn't even have guns in your mind until sandy hook came up and obama made a huge scene out of it. I bet you're not over the age of 25. Truth is you're a sheep that is following the heard led by Sheppard obama.

Wow, you could not be further from the truth. I am much older than that and grew up with guns and still am a gun owner. I see﻿ the need for better regulation on gun shows and for assault rifles and have been advocating for this for many years. I hate what happened in Sandy Hook but it did wake up a lot of other folks. I have always had my eyes wide open. I don't agree on all things with the President but do on this one.

Then you're﻿ a hypocrite gun owner. I think you're full of shit personally. If you were really a gun owner you would know that semi auto's are not assault rifles. As i said before where were you before sandy hook if you think guns are the problem. You realize we passes this same legislation twice already and watched as it did nothing to stop people from using guns to commit crimes right? And now you think it's a smart move to pass the same law yet again hoping for a different result...insanity.

America has 300 million+ handguns according to Piers Morgan,the other day. To me that is because Congress let them sell it for profits, now they will take the guns away, again for private profits, first, public safety second or last. It's all about money, whatever they do. It's ALREADY THE WILD WILD WEST in the eyes of the world. But, it's not so simple, imo, Britain, after﻿ ban has now 300000 illegal handguns on the streets in the wrong hands; criminals. It must be thought through; not shoved.

Even that, if decreed to be, by Congress and or President order, it seems to many to be Shootout at The OK Corrall, ..ie the wild west again, just to enforce the law, with SWAT teams making SwissCheese of houses and, people inside because, all they want to do is keep their self defense weapons?
No,that's crazy thinking too, it's not the gun but, it's precisely SSRI's when dosage is changed, that in all instances initiated the recent massacres; it's reported now.

I remind you all of the fiasco at Waco Texas, that was, according to just about everyone not handled with common-sense you speak of but, resulted in kids dying by an overzealous, amateurish raid, instead of expert negotions to end it.
You threaten people, be you civlian or FED, you are asking, or provoking, often that violence to occur by either arrogance, ignorance or unprofessionalism in police praxis. That was proven to be the case.

It makes me believe my decision long ago, to not accept a﻿ promotion, in a job I once had, with weapon's training and permit, as I never wanted to have a gun, in a urban setting anyhow, despite better pay.
I see, not owning a gun,might spare me a lot of unnecessary hassle but, I see no harm of people, lawfully owning one, in a rural setting, where cops can't respond; again, precisely cause it's like a wild jungle out there: moral anarchy.

It's not shameful, it's reality. People don't want to hear the truth, that if we eliminated military style weapons that OBVIOUSLY people would be stopped from committing violent massive murders. These children aren't just any children, they were directly affected by Newtown's tragedy, and they deserve to have a say. You're the one who is ignorant, instead of pushing these kids away, we should give them a chance to speak their peace, since it was their﻿ siblings, friends, etc that were killed.

Sandy hook was a hoax..period. You're being lied to.﻿ This is not a conspiracy theory this is a conspiracy fact. You owe it to yourself to look at the evidence and answer the questions before doubting it. HOAX,LIES,COVER UP.

I'm in support of entertaining﻿ responsible beefing up of gun control laws (especially background checks), but I find this video manipulative, pandering, patronizing, and blatantly wrong.

No one is exploiting their kids. And no one is taking away your right to bear arms. The laws that Obama's administration is attempting to pass have in no way shape or form attempted to eradicate the second amendment. These kids have feelings and opinions, too, and unlike politicians these days, they have no sponsors or reason to say it like it is, and﻿ because of that, their opinions on these issues are valuable.

Do you really think all these people that believe sandy hook was a hoax are crazy?? i mean come on there are thousands and thousands of people that all say the same thing. The least you could﻿ do is look at the evidence and decide for yourself and not let people sway your opinion one way or the other...it's called being a responsible adult.

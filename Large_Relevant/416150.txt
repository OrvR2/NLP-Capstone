Japan's Abe turns to Southeast Asia to counter ChinaBy Linda Sieg and Jonathan Thatcher | Reuters – Tue, Jan 15, 2013

TOKYO/JAKARTA (Reuters) - The last time he was prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe's inaugural foreign trip was to China. In the job again 7 years later and relations with Beijing now chilly, Abe is turning first this time to the rising economic stars of Southeast Asia.
              A hawkish Abe wants them to help counterbalance the growing economic and military might of China at a time when Japan needs new sources of growth for its languishing economy and is debating whether to make its own military more muscular.
              But experts warn he will have to tread carefully during his visit to Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam this week to avoid provoking Bejing by appearing to "contain" China.
              Beijing is also scouring the region in search of new investment and trade opportunities and sources of raw materials. But it is also clashing with countries in the region in territorial rows in the South China Sea, as well as with Japan over tiny isles in the East China Sea.
              Moreover, Abe may find his hosts keen to avoid upsetting China, now their major economic partner as well.
              "The Japanese government is trying to solidify its relations with other countries in the region and strengthen its bargaining power before talking to China," said Narushige Michishita, an associate professor at the National Graduate Institute.
              Abe had hoped to go first to Washington this time after his Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) big win at the polls last month, in order to bolster the security alliance with his country's main ally. But because U.S. President Barack Obama was too busy, he will start with members of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
              Japanese firms are already eyeing Southeast Asia as an alternative to investment in China after a long-simmering feud with Beijing over disputed islands in the East China Sea flared up last year, sparking protests in China and hurting trade.
              Abe has made clear that ASEAN's planned integration in 2015, creating a bloc with combined economies worth $2 trillion and a population of 600 million, is a significant lure for a Japanese economy that has been trapped in deflation for decades and whose population is ageing fast and shrinking.
              He also says, however, that he wants to go beyond mere economic ties and expand relations in the security field. He is expected to give a policy speech in Jakarta.
              SHARED VALUES
              In an echo of the push for a broader Asian "arc of freedom and prosperity" that underpinned Abe's foreign policy during his first term in office - which ended when he quit abruptly - the Japanese leader is also likely to refer to his desire for deeper ties with countries that share democratic and other values.
              "Japan's path since the end of World War Two has been to firmly protect democracy and basic human rights and stress the rule of law," Abe told NHK public TV on Sunday. "I want to emphasize the importance of strengthening ties with countries that share such values."
              Abe has said repeatedly that he wants to improve ties with Beijing despite his tough stand over the islands dispute. But some warn his rhetoric could been seen as trying to box in China, provoking Beijing and worrying Southeast Asian countries whose economies are increasingly linked to China's.
              "What is the point of making an enemy of China?," said Hitoshi Tanaka, a former diplomat who is now chairman of the Institute for International Strategy in Tokyo. "It is not smart diplomacy in my view and the last thing the nations named as targets of 'values diplomacy' would welcome."
              ECONOMY FIRST
              Abe will need to reassure his hosts that he will not let the islands row with China get out of hand despite his hawkish security stance and his desire to revise Japan's take on its wartime history with a less apologetic tone.
              "Prime Minister Abe might be seen as revisionist but this should not influence the dispute as all countries in the region would rather focus on economic development than see this conflict deteriorate," said Damrong Kraikuan, director-general of the Thai foreign ministry's East Asia Affairs Department.
              "But the South China Sea will not be the highlight of his visit to Bangkok," he added. "Thailand will take note of what Japan has to say and we will listen, but we have to take other countries into consideration to make progress."
              Japan's remains a huge economic influence in ASEAN. It is the group's biggest source of foreign direct investment, after the European Union and almost three times the size of China's.
              That is a position Japan wants to keep in what has become one of the world's fastest growing regions.
              "Japan is concerned about losing out to China in trade and investment," said Jayant Menon, lead economist at the Asian Development Bank's Office for Regional Economic Integration. "(The visit) sends an important message."
              In Vietnam, Japan pledged investments of $4.9 billion in the first 10 months of last year, nearly double the whole of 2011. In Thailand, from January-September, foreign investment almost tripled to around $8.1 billion.
              In the group's biggest economy, Indonesia, net direct investment last year looked to be heading for a record amount.
              And Japan was ASEAN's second biggest trading partner in 2011, just behind China, according to the group's figures.
              "The visit comes at a very important time ... Despite the serious (global) economic situation, Japan keeps helping Indonesia. And Indonesia is a market and source of raw material to Japan," said Arbi Sanit, a political analyst at the University of Indonesia.
              "It is a more compassionate relationship, not simply one of economic rationale," he said.
              Abe's young government has already been pushing hard to improve relations in the region. He sent his foreign minister last week to Brunei, Singapore, Australia and the Philippines. Manila, for one, has welcomed signs of Japan's willingness to play a bigger regional security role.
              Finance Minister Taro Aso went to Myanmar early this month as part of Japan's push to tap the potential of the country's opening up to the outside world.
              Nevertheless, Abe will have to tread carefully on the topic of Japan's wartime aggression, which remains a sensitive issue.
              His government has said it would stick by a landmark 1995 apology for Japan's wartime aggression.
              But Abe also wants to issue a statement of his own and has expressed interest in revisiting a 1993 government statement apologizing for military involvement in kidnapping Asian women to work in wartime military brothels.
              "Everyone knows that if the new government were to change the basic line then Japan will be isolated in East Asia because China, Korea and even Southeast Asia will make lots of issues out of a change in interpretation (of the past)," Tanaka said.

Best way to keep your economic influence in ASEAN is be honest, fair and conduct good business. You don't add sugar and milk in green tea...

PM Abe represents the younger leaders in Japan where they never experienced the cruelties and hurseness of the last world war     which were imposed by the Japanese empirial army to the people of these region and parts of Asia to Guam, Iwo Jima & Hawaii. He is opening old wounds  by just ignoring the past and now seeking their friendship because of vested interest. Thousands and thousands died in the hands of the Japanese soldiers and those events cannot just be forgotten

Japan again copies America at the wrong time, with less money, less military muscle but with a bad taste of WWII in the mouth with SE Asia.

Japan has never gave a rat's #$%$ about Southeast Asia.  They are doing it because of China.   It says so in the title.

Over four million Indonesians died during Japan's conquest and brutal occupation of Indonesia. Not to mention the 5000 Dutch women, ages 11-45 who were raped daily by the Japanese.  Over 90,000 Thai rebels fought the Japanese occupation of Thailand, they saved downed US pilots and ferried them out to rescue ships.  The Japanese, when they apprehended these Thai rebels, beheaded them.

The article says he will be too busy to meet with Abe.  This is true, since he is managing his coronation.  He was also too busy to meet with Netanyahu, when he was in the US.  Can't remember the reason for that dis.  Oh well, they are both only two of the top leaders, in two of the hottest hot spots on the planet.  I guess they should have asked for an "audience", rather then a meeting.

ASEAN countries will put aside Japan occupation there during WWII if the price is right. Japan certainly can print as much YEN as needed. Japan's deficit is reaching 300% GDP. Good luck ASEAN.

Japan Imperial Army massacred 40,000,000 South East Asian, Chinese, American, New Zealanders, British and Australian. Raped hundreds of thousands women and children. Lest we forget.

Now Japan need us. Remember how arrogant they were prior/during WW2 when they demanded protection money from SEA overseas Chinese! In Malaya the protection money was USD 50 millions which was collected by the various Chinese Clans and handed over to the Japanese Consult. . Failing to pay the protection money would result in mass killing of overseas Chinese as that in Nanking, China, where over 330,000 Chinese were slaughtered and with babies tipping the bayonets of  many Japanese soldiers and Chinese heads rolling in the streets. Near the end of WW2 over 2000 Australian POW were death marched from Sandakan to Ranau , North Borneo and with only two survivors. It was just as bad in the Philippines , Burma, Indonesia, etc. Strong health  y Indonesians were round up from Java and sent to various SEA facilities. The girls were sent to Japanese military brothels and the males were used for live experiments and as lab rats for training military docs, medics and interrogators.  In Sabah when the Japanese on losing the war rounded up any  English educated local inhabitants and beheaded them at Petagas: that the victorious English will have no workers for its post war operation! So the list of atrocities roll on. As for China, Imperial China were the protectors of the regions before the colonization of SEA by the Western Powers and the ceding of Chinese territories of Burma, "French-IndoChina", Malaya ,the 17th vassal states of China, the Chinese Republic of Borneo and the  various Protected Islands of the East Indies. The Chinese Navy would keep South China Sea and the East indies islands relatively free from pirates!
Now Japan thought we have caught amnesia and that we should team up with our tormentors , oppressors and gang up  again China that had been historically a protector of the region! We in SEA are a forgiving lot but we are not stupid and remember our suffering under the Imperial Japanese. Japan is still Imperial Japan and not Republic of Japan!

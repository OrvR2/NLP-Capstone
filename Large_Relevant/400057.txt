4daysagoFrench-led forces in Mali seal off Timbuktu; rebels torch ancient libraryThousands of residents came out to celebrate after French and Malian troops entered the town of Gao on Sunday, with a parade of motorbikes honking their horns and people weeping in disbelief. Lindsey Hilsum of the UK's Channel 4 News reports.By Adama Diarra and Richard Valdmanis, ReutersGAO, Mali -- French and Malian troops on Monday sealed off Timbuktu, a UNESCO World Heritage site, but fleeing Islamist rebel fighters torched several buildings in the ancient Saharan trading town, including a library of priceless manuscripts.Without a shot being fired to stop them, 1,000 French soldiers including paratroopers and 200 Malian troops seized the airport and surrounded the centuries-old Niger River city, looking to block the escape of al-Qaida-allied fighters.The retaking of Timbuktu followed the swift capture by French and Malian forces at the weekend of Gao, another major northern Malian town which had also been occupied by the alliance of Islamist militant groups since last year.

A two-week intervention by France in its former Sahel colony, at the request of Mali's government but also with wide international backing, has driven the Islamist rebel fighters northwards out of towns into the desert and mountains.A French military spokesman said the assault forces at Timbuktu were being careful to avoid combat inside the city so as not to damage cultural treasures and mosques and religious shrines in what is considered a seat of Islamic learning.But Timbuktu's mayor, Ousmane Halle, reported that fleeing Islamist fighters had torched a South African-funded library in the city containing thousands of priceless manuscripts.Nic Bothma / EPAA French soldier in Mali on Sunday. "The rebels set fire to the newly constructed Ahmed Baba Institute built by the South Africans ... this happened four days ago," Halle Ousmane told Reuters by telephone from Bamako. He said he had received the information from his chief of communications who had traveled south from the city a day ago.Ousmane was not able to immediately say how much the concrete building had been damaged. He added the rebels also torched his office and the home of a member of parliament.The Ahmed Baba Institute, one of several libraries and collections in the city containing fragile ancient documents dating back to the 13th century, is named after a Timbuktu-born contemporary of William Shakespeare and houses more than 20,000 scholarly manuscripts. Some were stored in underground vaults.'Free as the wind'The French and Malians have faced no resistance so far at Timbuktu, but they face a tough job of combing through the labyrinth of ancient mosques and monuments and mud-brick homes between alleys to flush out any hiding Islamist fighters."We have to be extremely careful. But in general terms, the necessary elements are in place to take control," French army spokesman Lieutenant Thierry Burkhard said in Paris.Timbuktu member of parliament El Hadj Baba Haïdara told Reuters in Bamako the Islamist rebels had abandoned the city. "They all fled. Before their departure they destroyed some buildings, including private homes," he said.The United States and European Union are backing the French-led Mali operation as a strike against the threat of radical Islamist jihadists using the West African state's inhospitable Sahara Desert as a launch pad for international attacks.In the first installment of Rock Center's Hidden Planet series, Richard Engel travels to Mali, on the edge of the Sahara desert, to discover the city of Timbuktu. They are helping with intelligence, airlift of troops, refueling of planes and logistics, but do not plan to send combat troops to Mali. In Gao, crowds celebrated the arrival of French forces. Many smoked cigarettes, women went unveiled and some men wore shorts to flout the severe Shariah Islamic law the rebels had imposed for months. Youths on motorcycles flew the flags of Mali, France and Niger, whose troops also helped secure the ancient town on the Niger River."Now we can breathe freely," said Hawa Toure, 25, wearing a colorful traditional African robe banned under Shariah for being too revealing. "We are as free as the wind today. We thank all of our friends around the world who helped us," she said.About a dozen rebels were killed in Gao, while French forces suffered no losses or injuries, the French defense ministry said.Youths in Gao said there were still some rebels and rebel sympathizers around, but they were being found. "Yesterday, even, we found one hiding in a house. We cut his throat," one man said, asking not to be named. "Today we found another and we brought him to the army."A third northern town, the Tuareg seat of Kidal, in Mali's rugged and remote northeast, remains in rebel hands.Related:Jihadists leave trail of destruction, brutality

Considering that the militia that was responsible for Benghazi was already driven underground when armed Libyans attacked their headquarters days after the embassy attack, it seems as though the Libyans themselves turned the tables on these Islamists.  Who would we attack anyway?  Should we drop bombs on Libya - the very people who sought revenge for us and in our name?
Working for the State Department has always been dangerous and many embassies and diplomats have been attacked over the years.  Should we drop bombs on all of those countries too - even the ones in Europe?  Rest assured that in the larger scheme of things we have killed scores more of them than they have of us.
I don't remember any of those other promises either.

 I know history very well; it was never a national policy to convert any one to any religion; did some over-jealous fools take it upon themselves over the years, of course; but a national policy it was not; do not be angry at the American expedience, it is governed by mere mortals, with all their failings; but the American experience has brought the world a entire new culture, many mistakes were made and are being made; however as much as politicians do not like the Constitution (it puts limits on their ideas); the Constitution always bring them back to reality.2 votes#1.21 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:32 PM ESTByron Raum
once the Islamic extremist take over, they always destroy any writings  that do not conform to the Koran; it was first the asia middle east,  then the northern Africa middle east, now it is spreading into central  Africa,

Spreading is a bit of an exaggeration, given how easily they were repelled by the French.

Europe is in a mess with the Islam's moving in,, (LOOK AT  France); THERE EYE IS ON THE BIGGEST PRIZE OF ALL America, THEY WILL BE A  MAJORITY OVER HERE WITHIN 50 YEARS, WAKE UP FOLKS, IT IS HAPPENING  RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES.

We are certainly headed towards a non-white-majority country. If it bothers you, you are welcome to leave. No one forces you to be an American.

the Christians were successful in taking over America ; however they did  not require everyone to follow their belief, that is why in the  Constitution

That's because the Enlightenment had already forced Christianity to be more tolerant of intellectual opposition. The Christianity of the Founding Fathers was very different from real Christianity a few centuries earlier, which unfortunately, re-emerged later even in the US with the Puritannical viewpoint.
So, yes, all Christians do not require "conversion or death", but then, neither do most Muslims.1 vote#1.24 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:38 PM ESTDrezz-2874852"Can the religious amongst us please go get raptured already?"

There wasn't an elected government; it was a coup.  That is why the U.S. stopped sending foreign aid to Mali all this time until recently.  NOW the U.S. is aiding them because we are actually supporting France against these and not Mali...I believe Congress did some voodoo magic to correct the wording to allow the U.S. to 'legally' support France and Mali's official government in a sense removing the hurdles, but it was not a freely elected government...#1.27 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:06 PM ESTInspiredByHumanitySaxon-

Catholic, Protestant, Methodist, Baptist... as long as the "Indian" part was beaten out of the child and the Christian part was hammered in, it didn't matter which section of the Christian religion was taught.

Can any religion be more intolerant in 21st century?
One can see a pattern in the Sunni Islamic extremism and its devastating impacts in most of the places.
Followers of Islamic cult, especially House of Saud and other Sunni ME rulers inspired and funded Sunni Islamic radicals and militants (al-Qaida, Salaffi, Wahhabi, MB, Taliban and other label ones), are fast marching backwards to their seventh century desert tribal days.
They are indulging in rapings, lootings, killings and genocides of non-Muslims (Darfur, S. Sudan, Nigeria and spreading like wild fire in many regions and Muslims (Libya, Yemen, Mali, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan and other places).
In Egypt, the Sunni extremists with labels like Salaffi and MB (Muslim Bloodhounds) are opening up new chapters of Islamic bigotry. Morsi is just a front for them.
Just watch the fate of sane Muslims, minority sect/tribe people, Christians, women and Israel as the time goes by.
Pakis and Sunni rulers of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, UAE and other Sunni Arab League nations are responsible for 80 percent of world problems including economic ones.

(They dispached a fleet of seven ships including an aircraft carier and deployed 640 commandos on the ground in november 2001).

Why bother...

Smooth Mahooty, our ignorant friend, there you go again.
Here is why:
Robert Fowler, a Canadian diplomat who was kidnapped by al Qaida in Islamic Magreb in 2009, said his captors told him their hope was to create an Islamic emirate that spanned Africa. Their goal was to spread chaos from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
This is what Fowler said: "They would tell me repeatedly that their objective was to extend the chaos of Somalia across the Sahel to the Atlantic coast. They believed that in that chaos their jihad would thrive."
By the way, not just France, but also Canada and Germany flatly refused taking part in your moronic invasion and occupation of Iraq.

Let me start by saying you are so typical of those who by way of being intellectually lazy, cognitively challenged (not very bright), socially inept, not so subtly racist (typically your crowd speaks in code as to your hidden racism) will... as a matter of course always pollute any discourse between adults. Your comments are juvenile, puerile and in the broadest terms... Reactionary (a person who is defined not by what you are for but rather what and who you are against). Possibly you are a pre adolescent or maybe someone desperate for attention... any attention (negative or otherwise)? Maybe you are confined to a bed for life and your anger is channeled in attacking others? Maybe you have a head injury? But, I will try to use language and imagery you might understand... smell that smoke... there burning the White Trash in your town! That said... ultimately you are guitlty of being a BORE! 3 votes#8.8 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:53 PM ESTscreminmimiAm I mistaken in remembering that a Frenchman had something to do with assisting us in our original tiff with the British Crown back in '75?
And say what you will.... nothing and no one will ever take the place in my heart that is held by those Musketeers!! "One for all, and all for one!"#8.9 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 5:06 PM ESTZheng HeAmerica refuels all NATO planes.  The French are always there pulling doing their part; they just don't look for face time on TV or wave the flag  like the British or American politicians do.#8.10 - Tue Jan 29, 2013 3:52 AM EST

Most are peaceful. I dont find it anymore threatening than some other religions. It's the 'numbers' of their extremists are their varied interpretations of their religion that is obviously curious to us. Having had attended a Catholic grade school I have memories of the nuns there who should have been goose-stepping and wearing armbands to more occurately display their usual demeanor. Most all should see that America is in fact the final solution to the various cultural differences as we've proven for the most part, that we can in fact co-exist despite differences. This of course is very scary to those who wish to continue the madness since 800 B.C.. Sooner or later, we'll all just kill each other, or, we'll get along. Meanwhile, we have to have our little wars.#13 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:00 PM ESTInspiredByHumanityI challenge ANY Muslim to get in front of a camera and denounce the atrocities of their radical Islamic fundamentalist brothers that commit the atrocities in the name of Allah.  I also challenge their Imams to do the same in their Mosques.
You will NOT find one to do that.  To do that would go against the will of Allah and they will be branded a traitor to the cause and will have a mark on their name and family for other Muslims to kill them.7 votes#13.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 12:03 PM ESTpeteMTLook up 'taqiyya'.
That's what 'moderate' muslims may be up to.
Lying to unbelievers.#13.2 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:53 PM ESTKamKamInspiredbyHumanity it's already been done, just google it. Yet Westerners insist on closing their eyes and ears and saying lalalala it's not gonna happen. Nothing any moderate Muslim does will satisfy people who think like this. What people like that really want is for Muslims to not be Muslims. #13.3 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:11 PM ESTInspiredByHumanityKamKam-
I honestly don't know where to look for that.  Can you cite where I should go to see these denouncements?  Is it on youtube?  Have Imams actually come out against these atrocities?

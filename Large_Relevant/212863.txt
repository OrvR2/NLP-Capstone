A new report out this month found that American officials could have  been unknowingly buying fuel from Iran for years - despite numerous  sanctions strictly prohibiting such a purchase. The report found that  the US failed to verify the source of the fuel they purchased for  Afghan security forces due to a lack of oversight by the Department of  Defense. Between 2007 and 2012, about 1.1 billion dollars was spent  for these purposes. So how did this happen? And what does it say about US sanctions in Iran?  Jamal Abdi, Policy Director for the National  Iranian American Council joins us to break it down.

Google $400 per gallon for fuel. That is what we pay for the the fuel we use for our military to operate in Afghanistan because of transportation to get it where it is needed...to guard poppy fields that produce heroin, that's smuggled by the CIA and exchanged for dollars that are laundered by our banks who support drug laws that create a black market and higher prices for drugs and fund Al Qaeda and CIA covert operations.... I mean - fight﻿ the bogus war on terror. I mis-spoke.

Trading with the﻿ "enemy" this was done during WWII. That is one of the reasons that Franco, who should have been grateful to Hitler for winning the Spanish Civil war for him did not enter WWII on the side of the Axis Powers as he needed a clear channel for the Axis and Allied powers to trade. Sound crazy? "War is a Racket," General Smedley Butler twice recipient of the Medal of Honor, also awarded the Marine Brevet Medal.

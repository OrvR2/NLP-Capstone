By MICHAEL HOWARD SAUL
Greater New York reeled Monday night under a ferocious assault from superstorm Sandy, a deadly weather system that knocked out power to millions of homes and endangered tens of thousands who ignored evacuation orders.

Ahead of Sandy, New York Clears Out

Storm surges of more than nine feet sent flood water gushing into Lower Manhattan and other parts of the city, trapping residents and forcing emergency responders to make dangerous rescues. Hurricane-force winds ripped the facade off a Chelsea building, nearly knocked a crane off the top of a residential tower under construction in Midtown and felled countless trees. 
A 30-year-old man identified as Tony Laino of Flushing in Queens was killed when a tree toppled onto a house and pinned him, New York City police said. A Queens woman was electrocuted, authorities said. Two people were killed in Mendham, N.J., about 40 miles west of Manhattan, when a tree fell on their vehicle at about 7:30, authorities said. New York officials said at least five people were killed in the state.
NYU Langone Medical Center was being evacuated of intensive-care patients Tuesday morning, after a power generator failed. They were being taken to Mount Sinai Hospital.   

"This is dangerous," said Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who urged residents Monday night to stop overloading the 911 system with calls that aren't about "life-threatening emergencies." "This is a once-in-a-long-time storm."

A tree is uprooted on Carlton Avenue in Brooklyn on Monday.
Authorities said they were increasingly concerned about 50 people trapped on Fire Island. Waves from the Atlantic Ocean were washing across the narrow barrier island and flowing into the Great South Bay, putting parts of the beach community completely under water. Earlier in the day, firefighters made a dramatic rescue of 14 people on Fire Island who had ignored evacuation orders and then called for help.
As the wind and flooding reached a crescendo Monday evening, authorities from New Jersey to Connecticut said they had largely given up efforts to rescue people who stayed behind. "They are now in harm's way," New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said. "I don't know if we can get them out or not, given the conditions."

Most of Manhattan below 39th Street lost power. Consolidated Edison

 took the unprecedented step of shutting down power in Lower Manhattan preemptively to save underground infrastructure from flood waters, but most of the outages weren't planned, officials said.Overall, nearly four million homes and businesses in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were without power Tuesday morning, including 475,000 in New York City, almost 800,000 on Long Island and 155,000 in Westchester County. Even more power failures were expected by Tuesday morning, officials said.
Officials warned it could be more than a week before power is restored because work crews can't begin repairing lines until the storm has subsided. 
The New York City subway and all mass transit into the city was shut down for Tuesday, and officials said it may be days before service returns. Bridges and tunnels were closed across the region, including the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the Holland Tunnel, the Tappan Zee Bridge and all spans across the East River.  
Citing floodwaters, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has closed four airports near the city: Kennedy, LaGuardia, Newark Liberty International and Teterboro Airports.  
The nation's largest school system was ordered shut on Tuesday for the second consecutive day.
Across the Hudson River, Jersey City and Hoboken officials said their cities were inundated and requested emergency help from the state.
Concern was growing along the region's vulnerable coast lines, where hundreds of thousands of people had been under orders to evacuate since Sunday. 
Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Monday night that thousands of people were already stranded in their homes from flooding. About eight towns were of the most concern, including Greenwich, Stamford, Bridgeport and Norwalk. Another 10 towns could also see significant damage, including New Haven, Westbrook and Branford. "The situation is dire," Mr. Malloy said.  
At least 3,651 people checked into New York City's emergency shelters by 6 p.m. on Monday, fewer than the 10,000 who did the same during Tropical Storm Irene last year. The number was about 5% of the capacity of 70,000 in 76 city shelters.
The decision to evacuate their homes was an agonizing one. Some who stayed behind said they were worried about the storm but had concerns about public shelters. 
Some were regretting the decision. On Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, Kristin Franchock, who stayed in her home with her husband and three children despite an evacuation order, said Monday night their basement was flooded with eight feet of water and their power was out.
"Definitely a mistake to stay," said Ms. Franchock.
The storm resulted in frenzied scenes across the city Monday night.

Some in the Brooklyn section of Dumbo left the waterfront neighborhood Monday evening after an electrical fire broke out along Washington Street. Police cordoned off a building under renovation as smoke drifted up from an area believed to have caught fire from an electrical explosion, said Paul Morris, 40 years old. Residents fought to erect sandbag walls to prevent the East River from breaching the first level of apartment buildings there.  
"Water was at least three blocks deep into Dumbo," said Mr. Morris.
Others marveled at the storm's spectacle.  "Tenth Avenue is a river," said Ron Downey, 50, the CEO of a digital media startup.

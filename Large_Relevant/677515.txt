A gunman shot and wounded three people at an office building in Phoenix, Ariz., today and police are now searching for the shooter, authorities told ABC News.


One of the victims is in critical condition, the others received non-life threatening injuries, according to police.


Police are clearing the office complex in the in the 7310 block of 16th Street, near Glendale Avenue.


Officials say there was only one gunman, who remains at large.


A witness told ABC News she heard several shots, and took cover in an IT closet with several other women. Another witness heard between six and 10 shots fired.


Police believe the suspect entered the building looking for a specific individual, but was confronted and an altercation ensued, Phoenix police Sgt. Tommy Thompson told ABC News affiliate KNXV-TV.


Cops know the name of the suspect and are at his home.


In addition to the office complex, and the suspect's home, police are also  investigating a third scene, according to KNXV-TV. It's not clear how it's related to the office shooting.


The shooting took place moments after former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, the victim of a shooting in Phoenix in 2011, testified before Congress on gun control.


In the weeks since 20 students were gunned down at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school on Dec. 14, 2012, several mass shootings have garnered public attention as the nation debates its relationship to firearms.


Five days ago, two men were wounded during a shooting at Lone Star College in Houston, Texas. Earlier this month, a 16-year-old student was arrested after shooting a classmate in Taft, Calif.

This story was breaking news when they thought that it was a mass killing. Now that there's no dead, the media has dropped the story. Talk about the media feeding the frenzy. I thought the media was supposed to be unbiased, and professional?

The journalism isn't just yellow in this country anymore. Its bright florescent orange!

Years ago I read an article about a young ambitious rookie journalist that was assigned the job of reporting local crime. Being a hard working guy he started reporting crime in his newspaper every day. Next thing you know everyone was up in harms that there was a local crime wave. In the end people figured out that the crime rate hadn't changed; it was only being reported by a young ambitious journalist.

While my heart goes out to the victims of any shooting are we seeing the an uptick in gun violence or are we seeing an increase in reporting?

Why doesn't the national media report about the mother that saved her children from a burgler ? This happened this morning in Texas. Guess it wouldn't go with their agenda of disarming America. And to finish he was an illegal imigrant.

From now until the cows come home you will hear the lamestream media harp on every style of shooting that happens and mention Sandy Hook at the end of the story. Doesn't matter if it's gang violence, black on black crime, domestic violence or sheer stupidity. It will be attached to Sandy Hook. Seems we are now destine for Austrailia gun laws and the crime that will follow since we will all be unarmed.

All part of PETA war on hunters.  Notice they never mention the type of gun unless its a rifle.
If they published inner city shootings you could have over 50 articles a day and cover a little over half the shootings.

Its not lack of gun laws. Its an overabundance of crazed people that's the problem.

This is becoming a normal part of life now. We are unfortunately never going to stop all this senseless violence.

30 years ago this would never have made the national news but since we have instant up to the second internet and since guns are a huge issue right now every incident will be reported. We must remember that we live in a huge country with a huge population and this isn't happening down the block from your house everyday (well maybe in some hoods).

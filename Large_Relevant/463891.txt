Seth! I rarely comment on videos but this one hit me right in the BTTF nerd area of my heart! (lol) The car DOES NOT leave a fire trail when it returns from time travel. There is,﻿ however an explosion and flash of light at the precise moment it leaves and one when it returns. Another thing, in order for this to be correct, the cart has to continue along it's path exactly as it was before starting time travel, not come back going the other way as yours does. Still enjoyed the idea! good work! :)

Could you make it so that both the play and the minecart are teleported to somewhere else﻿ as if it was travelling through time?

It could be even more like Back to the Future if there was a command block near the end that would teleport the minecart at th end of the tracks. That really would only be useful in﻿ adventure maps, but it could work nonetheless.

Hi Seth,Ender here. I just want to share my opinion. (Again,OPINION guys) I LOVE your videos,I really do. I watch them all﻿ the time. But there is ONE issue. You always sound bored. Sometimes when you talk I can imagine you smiling,but barely ever. To be honest,I think you should try pepping up. Get excited,talk louder,and always try to be happy. :) Love you Seth! Bye!

Could you make﻿ it as instead of the player going underground, only the minecart did and the player got teleported, maybe using a command block? And if you can, could the player spawn inside a different minecart?
If so that would make the most perfect transportation device in an adventure map.

The flames are created DURRING time travel, when the car is rapidly accelerating through space-time and is still close enough in the time line to interract with the matter in those spacial points﻿ in which it partially existed, so the flames being created with the minecart still there is accurate.

Angeldude actually IS correct. In the movie, the flame trails always appear AFTER the vehicle time travels, in the position where the wheels would be.

All you have to do is watch the movie to﻿ see the car disappears visually when the flames are created. Going with your explanation the car is not visible during the time when it is going through space time, only the resultant flames are, so he was right.

This is an important message concerning the redstone update. Could you, for the sake of us mapmakers, suggest to Dinnerbone﻿ that he should add wireless redstone nodes into mine craft,﻿ ONLY FOR CREATIVE so that it isn't overpowered in survival but is accessible for map makers.

HEY! Sethbling! With this, you could have a repeater clock connected to a command block﻿ checking to see if a player in a minecart hits a certain area, and then the command block would issue a nearest player teleport to somewhere. Maybe...THE FUTURE!!! and the command block would vanish underneath making it appear the minecart also vanished!

It didn't work the last time I tried - riding a pig, boat, or minecart causes you to be locked to the vehicle; you'll snap right back to it﻿ in an instant. It's the same reason endermen fail to teleport out of minecarts.
If this has been fixed, then apologies, you're right. But it wasn't fixed the last time I checked.

Cool! Can you connect the redstone to a command block to also teleport the player to a new area? You﻿ could make it look like you actually travel in time while you ride the minecart! :D

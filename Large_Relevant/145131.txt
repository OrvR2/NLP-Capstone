Fourth-grader wins science fair with drug-sniffing dogs, ounce of cocaineBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Thu, Jan 31, 2013Tweet0

In an early bid for Father of the Year, a Miami police detective allowed his 10-year-old daughter to use three drug-sniffing dogs and an ounce of cocaine for a science fair project, according to the Miami Herald.
Douglas Bartelt, a detective with the Miami-Dade Police Narcotics Bureau, provided his daughter, Emma, with three detector canines and 28 grams of cocaine (street value: approximately $1,300) for her entry into Coral Gables Preparatory Academy's annual science fair.
Not surprisingly, she won. The first-place honor gave Emma an automatic entry into the Miami -Dade Elementary Schools Science Fair, where her drug-sniffing project earned an honorable mention.
“The purpose for this scientific investigation was to find which dog would find the cocaine fastest using it’s [sic] sense of smell,” the fourth-grader wrote in the abstract for her project, titled "Drug Sniffing Dogs."
Bartelt, according to the Miami Herald, fellow detective William Pedraja and Sgt. Samantha Machado provided the dogs (a springer spaniel named Roger; Levi, a golden retriever; and Franky, a retired chocolate labrador) and the cocaine. (Franky showed he's still got the touch, locating the illegal substance in 43 seconds.)
Emma's mother, Michelle Bartelt, said the experiment was her daughter's idea and that Emma was under constant supervision and "did not touch the cocaine."
“[Doug] handled the drugs,” she said. “He’s always very meticulous about how he handles drugs.”
John Schuster, a spokesman for the school district, issued a statement saying the project, while unusual, did not violate any of the science fair's rules—and that cocaine is not a specifically banned substance.

Art and Craft of Diplomacy: Secretary of State John Kerry Faces ‘Complex Agenda’By Christiane Amanpour, Mary-Rose Abraham, David Miller & Brian Fudge | Around the World – Thu, Jan 31, 2013Tweet0

In her four years as the 67th Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton traveled nearly a million miles, visited 112 countries and had 1,700 meetings with world leaders. Besides a grueling travel schedule, the president’s chief foreign affairs adviser must wield all the tools of a negotiator: the art and craft of diplomacy.
This week Clinton steps down from her post. Taking her place is Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The new secretary of state faces plenty of challenges: the crisis in Syria, Iran, North Korea, Israeli-Palestinian relations. And that’s just to name a few. So how does the craft of diplomacy help the U.S. negotiate our increasingly complex geopolitical relationships?
In this episode of “Around the World,” Christiane speaks with R. Nicholas Burns. He served for 27 years in the U.S. foreign services, including as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs from 2005 to 2008. Burns is now a professor at Harvard’s Kennedy

Thursday in politics: Hagel goes before Armed Services Committee, and moreBy Phil Pruitt | The Ticket – Thu, Jan 31, 2013Tweet0
Former Sen. Chuck Hagel, President Barack Obama’s nominee to be secretary of defense, is certain to face tough questions Thursday when he testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The grilling will include his views on U.S. relations with Israel and Iran and how he would manage Pentagon spending.
But opposition from his fellow Republicans doesn’t necessarily signal doom for Hagel's nomination. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, in an exclusive interview with Yahoo News reporter Olivier Knox, said that although Hagel has strong opinions and quite a bit to explain, he is a "smart, capable guy" who deserves a full hearing.
The Senate takes up a bill Thursday that would suspend the federal debt ceiling until May 19, as long as both chambers of Congress commit to passing a budget. The measure passed the House last week.

Yahoo News exclusive: McConnell holds judgment on Hagel, calls him a ‘smart, capable guy’By Rachel Rose Hartman and Olivier Knox | The Ticket – Wed, Jan 30, 2013Tweet0

Will opposition from his fellow Republicans doom Chuck Hagel's nomination to be defense secretary? Maybe not, if you listen closely to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
The Kentucky lawmaker told Yahoo News in an exclusive interview that Hagel had strong opinions and quite a bit to explain. But McConnell called the former Nebraska senator a "smart, capable guy" who deserved a full hearing before the Armed Services Committee on Thursday.
"He’s had a lot of opinions. He was particularly opposed to much of what the Bush administration was doing in foreign policy. That didn’t mean he wasn’t a capable senator or a forceful advocate," McConnell told Yahoo News Chief Washington Correspondent Olivier Knox. Hagel, who served two terms in the Senate from 1997 to 2009, won two purple hearts in Vietnam, where he served as an enlisted Army infantry officer.
Hagel's years in the Senate haven't endeared him to many Republican lawmakers still smarting over his outspoken criticism of the Iraq

Want to have more sex? Men, stop helping with the choresBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Wed, Jan 30, 2013Tweet0
This is probably not considered an aphrodisiac by most, but the divsion of household chores may play a role in sex (AFP)No good deed goes unpunished.
That famous phrase from Clare Booth Luce apparently applies to married men, according to a new study that finds men who help with the housework tend to have less sex.
The University of Washington research, published Wednesday in the American Sociological Review, suggests that heterosexual couples have more “sexual encounters” when each partner takes on traditional gender roles.
“Where the male is doing the male tasks and the female is doing the female tasks, those are the couples (who) are having more sex,” UW Associate Professor of Sociology and study co-author Julia Brines said in an interview with the Toronto Star.
You can find a PDF copy of the study at the bottom of Brines’ UW page.
The study had some other interesting findings. For instance, twice as much time is spent on “female” chores (34 hours) each week than on tasks more typically considered “male” (17 hours).
Couples who participated in the study, most of whom split some of the "female"

Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder announced his support for efforts to pass a comprehensive overhaul of federal immigration laws, days after a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a blueprint for a reform bill that proponents hope will pass by summer.
Snyder declared his support during an interview on BloombergTV Tuesday and released a statement Wednesday urging action to offer a path to citizenship for "qualified" illegal immigrants.
"I am pleased to see that the president and a bipartisan group of congressional leaders are moving forward on this issue, focusing on areas of agreement to reform U.S immigration policy in a comprehensive manner," Snyder said in the statement. "I am looking forward to working with the president, Congress and my fellow Governors to see that legislation is enacted this year to ensure our borders are secure, that employers have an adequate system by which to verify employees are in the country legally, and that there is a tough, but fair, path to

Senate Judiciary Committee conducts first hearing on proposed gun control lawBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! NewsPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Jan 30, 2013Tweet0

More than a month after an elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn., that left 26 dead, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday held a three-hour hearing on gun control to examine possible new federal restrictions on "assault-style" weapons, background check enforcement and banning high capacity magazines.
The hearing comes amid calls from President Barack Obama to enact the most sweeping gun laws passed in a century. The legislation that followed, introduced by California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, has been met with fierce opposition from gun-rights advocates.
For the hearing, both sides brought in their most high-profile activists, notably former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, retired NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, and National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre.
The hearing began with a statement read by Giffords, who sustained a gunshot to the head in a January 2011 Tucson town hall shooting. Speaking slowly but forcefully,

Three shot, one dead, at Phoenix office complex; manhunt for gunman under wayBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Wed, Jan 30, 2013Tweet0

At least three people were shot--one fatally--at an office complex in Phoenix on Wednesday, police there said, and a manhunt for the shooter is under way.
Witnesses said they heard as many as 10 gunshots fired.

According to Sgt. Tommy Thompson, the building was evacuated and the suspect fled the scene. The shooting—which occurred in the building's lobby—does not appear to be a random act, he noted, though he would not say if the suspect knew the victims.
Three gunshot victims were transferred to John C. Lincoln Hospital, where one, a male, later died, police said. The conditions of the other two were not immediately known.
At least three other people were transported to the hospital with minor injuries related to the shooting.
A SWAT team began canvasing a neighborhood in search of the suspected shooter described by Thompson as an "older" white male, possibly in his 60s.
“At this point we don’t believe he is in the area,” Thompson said. “This doesn’t appear to be a random type of incident.”
[Slideshow: Images from the scene]
The shooting occurred on the same day former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords—who was shot in the head during a mass shooting in Tuscon in 2011—testified at a Senate hearing on the proposed gun control law.
"Speaking is difficult but I need to say something important," Giffords said at the top of the hearing. "Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying. Too many children. We must do something. It will be hard, but the time is now. You must act. Be bold, be courageous, Americans are counting on you."

Was father of Newtown victim ‘heckled’ by pro-gun advocates?By Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Wed, Jan 30, 2013Tweet0
Heslin testifies in Hartford. (Screengrab via CTN)
MSNBC has told the Washington Post that it's reviewing its editing of a video that appeared to show gun rights advocates heckling the father of a Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victim during a state legislative hearing on gun violence.
At Monday's hearing in Hartford, Conn., Neil Heslin, father of 6-year-old Jesse Lewis, challenged lawmakers and lobbyists to prove why assault-style rifles—like the one reportedly used in last month's massacre in Newtown, Conn.—should be legal.
Via a transcript of Heslin's testimony:
I don’t know how many people have young children or children. But just try putting yourself in the place that I’m in or these other parents that are here. Having a child that you lost. It’s not a good feeling; not a good feeling to look at your child laying in a casket or looking at your child with a bullet wound to the forehead. I ask if there’s anybody in this room that can give me one reason or challenge this question: Why anybody in this room needs to have an, one of these assault-style weapons or military weapons or high-capacity clips. ... Not one person can answer that question.
"The Second Amendment!" several people shouted in response.
“Please no comments while Mr. Heslin is speaking or we’ll clear the room," a state official can be heard warning the audience. "Mr. Heslin, please continue.”
"We're all entitled to our own opinion, and I respect their opinions and their thoughts," Heslin said. "I wish they'd respect mine and give it a little bit of thought, and realize it could have been their child that could have been in that school that day."
But MSNBC's clip of the exchange on Tuesday omitted Heslin's open challenge to the audience. The cable network segment included a graphic that read, “Mocked and Loaded: Sandy Hook Victim’s Father Heckled by Gun Rights Advocates," to hammer home the point.

Cuomo’s poll numbers drop thanks to N.Y. gun control lawBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Jan 30, 2013Tweet0
Andrew Cuomo (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)NEW YORK—New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo predicted his record-high popularity would take a hit after he signed a tough new gun control measure into law earlier this month, and according to a new poll, he was right.
A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday found that Cuomo’s 74 percent job approval rating—one of the highest for any governor in the country—fell to 59 percent in the aftermath of the gun bill. According to the poll, 28 percent of New York residents surveyed disapproved of the job he’s doing as governor—an increase of 15 points since December.

Lampworking is an art form. Making bongs is a hobby for stoners. Real lampworkers like Cesare Toffolo study their whole lives to make art. Idiots like this give them a bad name. Those of us that spend time learning from true masters know the difference. Now take your ignorant ass back over to﻿ your bong and stfu child, I'll be busy in the studio making things that aren't used to get high.

5daysagoEgyptian president imposes state of emergency in 3 cities after deadly clashesA day after 37 people were killed in protests, chaos erupted among the thousands who walked to mourn them. Meanwhile, President Morsi declared a state of emergency. NBC's Ayman Moyeldin reports. Follow @NBCNewsWorld

By Edmund Blair and Yasmine Saleh, ReutersCAIRO - Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi declared a month-long state  of emergency on Sunday in three cities along the Suez Canal which have been the  focus of anti-government violence that has killed dozens of people over the past  four days.
 Seven people were shot dead and hundreds were injured in Port  Said on Sunday during the funerals of 33 protesters killed at the weekend. A  total of 49 people have been killed in demonstrations around the country since  Thursday and Morsi's opponents have called for more protests on Monday. 
"Down, down Morsi, down down the regime that killed and tortured us!" people  in Port Said chanted as the coffins of those killed on Saturday were carried  through the streets.

 In a televised address, Morsi said a nightly curfew  would be introduced in Port Said, Ismailia and Suez, starting Monday evening. He  also called for dialogue with top politicians. About 200 people protested in  Ismailia after the announcement."The protection of the nation is the  responsibility of everyone. We will confront any threat to its security with  force and firmness within the remit of the law," the president said, adding that  he offered condolences to families of the victims of those who died in the  cities.In Cairo the newly appointed interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim  was ejected from the funeral of one of the police officers who died during  Saturday's clashes in Port Said, according to witnesses and police sources.

A police officer at the funeral said many of his colleagues blame the interior  minister on the deaths of at least two policemen during Saturday's clashes as he  did not allow the police there to carry weapons and were only given teargas  bombs.
 State television said seven people died from gunshot wounds on  Sunday. Port Said's head of hospitals, Abdel Rahman Farag, told Reuters more  than 400 people had suffered from teargas inhalation, while 38 were wounded by  gunshots.Gunshots had killed many of the 33 who died on Saturday when  residents went on the rampage after a court sentenced 21 people, mostly from the  Mediterranean port, to death for their role in deadly soccer violence at a  stadium there last year.A military source said many people in Port  Said, which lies next to the increasingly lawless Sinai Peninsula, possess guns  because they do not trust the authorities to protect them. However it was not  clear who was behind the deaths and injuries.In Cairo, police fired  teargas at dozens at protesters throwing stones and petrol bombs in a fourth day  of clashes over what demonstrators there and in other cities say is a power grab  by Islamists two years after Hosni Mubarak was overthrown.In Ismaila  city, which lies on the Suez Canal between the cities of Suez and Port Said,  police also fired teargas at protesters attacking a police station with petrol  bombs and stones, according to witnesses and a security source there.The protesters accuse Morsi, elected in June with the support of his  Muslim Brotherhood group, of betraying the democratic goals of the revolution.  Most of the deaths since Thursday were in Port Said and Suez, both cities where  the army has now been deployed.The violence adds to the daunting task  facing Morsi as he tries to fix a beleaguered economy and cool tempers before a  parliamentary election expected in the next few months which is supposed to  cement Egypt's transition to democracy.Deep riftIt has exposed a deep rift in  the nation. Liberals and other opponents accuse Morsi of failing to deliver on  economic promises and say he has not lived up to pledges to represent all  Egyptians. His backers say the opposition is seeking to topple Egypt's first  freely elected leader by undemocratic means.Heba Morayef of Human  Rights Watch in Cairo said a state of emergency reintroduced laws that gave  police sweeping powers of arrest "purely because (people) look suspicious"."It is a classic knee jerk reaction to think the emergency law will help  bring security," she said. "It gives so much discretion to the Ministry of  Interior that it ends up causing more abuse which in turn causes more anger."The opposition Popular Current and other groups have called for more  protests on Monday to mark what was one of the bloodiest days of the 2011  uprising.On a bridge close to Tahrir  Square, youths hurled stones at police in riot gear who fired teargas to push  them back towards the square, the cauldron of the uprising that erupted on  January 25, 2011 and toppled Mubarak 18 days later. "None of the  revolution's goals have been realized," said Mohamed Sami, a protester in  Cairo's Tahrir Square on Sunday."Prices are going up. The blood of  Egyptians is being spilt in the streets because of neglect and corruption and  because the Muslim Brotherhood is ruling Egypt for their own interests."Clashes also erupted in other streets near the square. The U.S. and  British embassies, both close to Tahrir, said they were closed for public  business on Sunday, normally a working day.

The army, Egypt's interim  ruler until Morsi's election, was sent back onto the streets to restore order in  Port Said and Suez, which both lie on the Suez canal. In Suez, at least eight  people were killed in clashes with police.Many ordinary Egyptians are  frustrated by the violence that have hurt the economy and their livelihoods."They are not revolutionaries protesting," said taxi driver Kamal  Hassan, 30, referring to those gathered in Tahrir. "They are thugs destroying  the country."Call for dialogueThe National Defence Council,  headed by Morsi, called on Saturday for national dialogue to discuss political  differences.That offer has been cautiously welcomed by the opposition  National Salvation Front. But the coalition has demanded a clear agenda and  guarantees that any agreements will be implemented.The Front, formed  late last year when Morsi provoked protests and violence by expanding his powers  and driving through an Islamist-tinged constitution, has threatened to boycott  the parliamentary poll and call for more protests if its demands are not met,  including for an early presidential vote.Egypt's transition has been  blighted from the outset by political rows and turbulence on the streets that  have driven investors out and kept many tourists away. Its currency, the pound,  has steadily weakened against the dollar.

Her reaction: "I want to be clear that the United States is not in the business, in Egypt, ofchoosing winners and losers, even if we could, which of course we cannot."
However, is this true? According to Investor'sBusiness Daily, the Obama administration did, as it picked and colluded withthe Muslim Brotherhood. Furthermore, the administration favored Islamists oversecularists, and helped overthrow Mubarak, the reliable U.S. ally, who had outlawed the terrorist MuslimBrotherhood and honored the peace pact with Israel.
Today, Egypthas a Muslim Brotherhood hard-liner president (Mohammed Morsi), and there aremore calls for the destruction of Israel. There are new fears thatthe regime will invite al-Qaeda back into Egyptand open up a front with Israelalong the Sinai.
Who helped the Muslim Brotherhood gain control? Clinton's own department and the White House helped train the Brotherhood during Egypt's elections, selling out Israel and U.S. interests in the Mideast. Even more troubling is the untold story of howthe Obama administration secretly helped bring Islamofascists to power.

Perhaps the "Arab Winter" is more accurate.1 vote#1.31 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:06 PM ESTGodOfFateThis had almost nothing to do with Obama. It was a country with a brutal dictator (Mubarak) who our country backed, for the sake of stability and peace in the region, long before Obama was in office or even running for it. He was vice president of Egypt in 1975, and was made president, of Egypt due to an assassination of the former president, in 1981. Again, way before Obama. Either learn your history, or shut up about thing you clearly no nothing about.
Anyways, the point is that Mubarak spent all the money on the military, as many dictators do, leaving the people with nothing and a large force to "keep them in check." But then they rebelled. The revolution would have happened regardless of what we did. Actually, a similar situation happened in Iran where they overthrew a brutal regime we backed for a radical extremist one. We meddled, and we were worse off for it. But that (the Iran one) was long before Obama was even President. We were just doing the same awful foreign policy we've always done. The same thing happened here in Egypt, and would have regardless of whether or not Obama was President because we always react this way to these sorts of things regardless of who is President.
Now Obama may not be your favorite President. He isn't mine. But he has  nothing to do with Morsi or the Muslim Brotherhood. The United States is  just trying to work with Morsi and respect the "choice" of the Egyptian  people, for the sake of stability and peace in the region. The same exact reason why the United States backed Mubarak since at least the 80s. The "leaders" of our country in both parties have  voiced concerns about Morsi, but he is Egypt's "leader" (for now) so they  have at least tried to work with him. As for how we can point to our bad foreign policy, that has gone back, again, long before Obama was in office. We have been doing s**t like this for years in foreign policy. And every time we say we are going to change our foreign policy, we wind up doing the same dam things anyways. This goes back long before Obama, Bush, Clinton or even Carter. Heck, you can point to how we treated the Native Americans as the beginning of this mess, which was basically when we got here. Although that isn't technically foreign, and we no longer eradicate people who don't attack us first, we still do much the same kinds of crap we always have since before we were even a country. But again, it all started way before Obama got here.
That only leaves Morsi himself, who ironically is going to wind up spending money on the military like Mubarak did, and has already declared himself "temporary" Pharaoh. Now I don't blame the people of Egypt, savage as their mobs are (although that's a different issue) against woman, for voting in this obvious dictator and his Muslim Brotherhood. I say this because quite frankly they had no choice. It was either him, or Mubarak's remnants. And obviously, they weren't going to vote for what they just overthrew. It was a lose-lose situation, stuck between a rock and a hard place with no good options. There was even an outcry among much of the public of Egypt that they didn't have any fair choices. So in the end, despite many protests, they voted for the evil they didn't just have a revolution to get rid of. And now they are, ironically, back to where they started. Now again, they are rebelling against a dictator. But I ask you, what choice did they have? None.
The only thing we (the United States) could have done, is provide Egypt with better options. But every time we try to put up or support a new foreign government up ourselves, it turns into a disaster cause they don't trust us and because we quite frankly suck at it. So this administration decided to let things play out, and it turned out worse than if we had meddled, at least short term, due to opportunistic extremists in the region. But if this revolution is successful, and they not only overthrow Mubarak and get a decent choice to vote for without corruption to stop it, Egypt may be better off as a result in the long term. Although quite frankly, I wonder if such an unstable region can even do half of that. Either way, it would have turned out bad.3 votes#1.32 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:06 PM ESTAntistupidity

True that. I'm an Independent and not thrilled about Obama, but my gosh even the Conservatives didn't like Romney. That's why they kept desperately looking for other nominee's in a hope they would find someone better. And they couldn't. The cycle before that, I was all set to vote McCain and he picked Palin as his VP candidate. I think that is around the time he stopped being considered an honorable man by the public. Is it any wonder the Republicans lost to Obama twice? As someone who lived in Massachusetts while Romney was governor, I can tell you I flat wouldn't vote for him over just about anyone. The GOP simply couldn't field a decent candidate.
The sad thing is the GOP still wonders what's wrong with their party. Well, between that and all the radicals they now cater to who only seem to know how to blame Obama for everyone's problems.
I may not be thrilled with him, but you can't simply blame Obama for everything like stevephoenix-4019717 here, and also not give him credit for anything. It doesn't work like that double standard, and that is a very radical and ignorant view. I believe they also call that crying wolf. Even the President of the United States doesn't control everything. I would argue this one has a hard enough time trying and failing at controlling or "compromising" with congress, let alone the rest of the world. And now when Obama is actually at fault, well many people don't believe the Republicans because so many people have made so many downright silly accusations on him. Don't cry wolf or you lose your credibility. It's not hard to understand.2 votes#1.35 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:24 PM ESTAntistupidityGodOfFate
I used to like McCain but lost faith in him before he chose Palin, to me he changed when Bush got into office. Up till that time he was willing to work across the aisle and get things done, then he just turned very partisan, at this point I wonder if he even has a rational thought anymore. As far as Obama I am not thrilled either, the press propelled him in his first run, we could have had better. DB and many others on the right assume you have to be an extreme liberal if you don't agree with them or support Obama in any way on anything. I have debated DB before and am just tired of wasting my time. I wish the Republicans would stop being so partisan and beholden unto big business so we could start moving the country forward again. This constant partisanship and obstructionism is hurting the country so badly, and it leaves little option for the left to do anything except hold a partisan line. In the end the country and the people are the big losers.2 votes#1.36 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:56 PM ESTObama has divided the usaAntistupidity

I don't really care for Obama(who I believe is better than Romney) but at least place the blame where it actually belongs, the history is what it is you can't rewrite it to fit your arguments and agenda. I don't like sending F16's and tanks to Egypt now, but we aren't privy to what the agreements say nor do we know if we may be sending defective equipment, use your brains to do more than spout partisan hatred. F16's and Functional Tanks have never been available to the general public, M16s and military M4's have not been available to the public since 1986 under the Firearm Owners Protection Act.
If any president had the ability to control a countries populace, every country in the world would be under our control, no president can control the actions, thoughts and desires of the Egyptian, Syrian, Israeli, Chinese, Russian, Mexican, Canadian, or even the US's populace. If they could we would all be Obama lovers.2 votes#1.43 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 9:36 AM EST

"It is appalling that the Obama administration would send F-16s and 200 military tanks to Egypt in the wake of the instability, [and the] anti-American and anti-Israel atmosphere," Rep.

"The Muslim Brotherhood was pulling all the strings in the background,  the whole time.  They suckered the rest of the Egyptians in over a  commonly distastful regime."
Not entirely true, but mostly. The differences are that Mubarak was a dictator who needed overthrowing, and that the Muslim Brotherhood didn't show up in this way until a bit later.
As for Mubarak, the difference between him and other dictators is that we (the United States) backed Mubarak for the sake of stability and peace in the region despite the effect of his rule over Egypt on the people of Egypt. But his regime did need overthrowing and was quite corrupt and unfair to his people. While there were worse in the region (like Syria), that doesn't mean Mubarak's regime was good by any means. You can't  blame the people for revolting against Mubarak, as through the poor treatment of the people by Mubarak's "government" eventual revolt was inevitable.
I also don't believe the Muslim Brotherhood started pulling the strings until after they saw their opportunity through revolt. I say this because Mubarak's regime simply had too strong a hold on the region. There was no way they could have infiltrated a military regime like that. They took their chance after the regime was weakened somewhat by the revolution. That is when the Muslim Brotherhood really started pulling the strings. It was more of an opportunistic response than them being behind the whole thing from the start.

So, President Obama, WHO will you support this time?   The people who actually want REFORM and a DEMOCRATIC form of government?

I was speaking to the Executive Actions President Obama recently signed with regard to proposed gun control.  That said, since you want to go tit for tat on the issue of Executive Orders and assert that President Obama is abusing his power in that regard, this one is for YOU!  Note:  I didn't post it all in the form of a freaking book.  I just took the link straight from the source and submit it for your review.  One of my favorite Bush #2 Executive Orders is the Faith Based Initiative.  Clearly, he liked to see Church and State fornicate on a frequent basis.  I won't return the favor of calling you a naughty name.  That's something Conservatives do when they've nothing left in their very limited arsenal of actual facts.  Enjoy the link, sir.  You'll notice that Bush #2 signed 58 Executive Orders in his first year of office alone.  Talk about a dictator . . .right???

That's why people like me are standing up and speaking out for equal civil rights for all Americans, not just the ones Christianity or The Catholic Church likes.  Separation of Church and State is mandatory for our Republic and its Democracy to survive. 2 votes#20.2 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 7:51 PM ESTDaveyJonesDetroitAskn, does my freedom to believe constitute a threat to your freedom not to believe?  To paraphrase Thomas Jefferson, it does me no harm whether my neighbor believes in one God, twenty gods or no god.  Disestablishment meant that the federal government, which was created by the states, would not have any one "state sponsored" church, at the expense of the others.   Here's a little something from our Bill of Rights:
Amendment I
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html
You may have noticed the ABSENCE of the words "separation" "Church" and "state" in the First Amendment.  That phrase comes from President Thomas Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptist Association reassuring them that the federal government would not allow another church to infringe on their rights.  This same Danbury, Connecticut, is only a couple of miles from the Newtown massacre of innocents at Sandy Hook Elementary, after we have managed to eliminate God from another aspect of the public square.  "Elections have consequences..."
Since you're a history buff, you might like a book written by a Notre Dame PhD professor of history at Baylor University.  Thomas S. Kidd wrote "God of Liberty:  A Religious History of the American Revolution"  [New York:  Basic Books/Perseus, 2010].  Part of his book's thesis is that the American Revolution would not have occurred if it hadn't been for the First and Second Great Awakening, revivals of Christian fervor that swept the colonies during and prior to the 1760's.  Maybe you can read a little history for yourself...3 votes#20.3 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 8:55 PM EST

William-360414There is only one country in the entire region that has education, technology, tolerance for other religions, rights for women, and that country is Israel.  The very country that all of the Islamic countries hate.  Are they jealous, unhappy that others have education and progress?  Why does Iran hate Israel so much?

You can "flower" your words to INDICATE.....any other meaning....but....it's STILL a ROSE....BY ANY OTHER NAME.
The two words..."Muslim" and "brotherhood".....are NO  different than the words "Hezbollah", "Terrorist",  "Al Qaeda", Hamas. etc..........They are a "long way" from Martin Luther King's "I have a DREAM."
When a NATION.....cannot AGREE on establishing a DEMOCRACY......it only means....."That...they cannot TRUST.....themselves"......or each other....on establishing PEACE.  Somebody has  to RULE SOMEONE ELSE....by FORCE of WILL....or the GUN. 
They are probably "thinking" to themselves....MAYBE..just MAYBE.......MUBARAK... wasn't SO BAD......after all. Those were PEACEFUL days...."Oh hum"
I was ALWAYS......SUSPICIOUS of those TWO WORDS......"Muslim Brotherhood".....It really means......"RADICAL DICTATORSHIP".

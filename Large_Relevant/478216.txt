Reince Priebus: Last Week Was 'Good' For GOPBy George Stephanopoulos | ABC News – Sun, Sep 23, 2012

Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus called the past week a "defining week in both campaigns," describing it as a "good week" even as the GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney came under fire after secretly-taped comments he made at a fundraiser earlier this year became public.

"I think that we had a good week last week, I think in retrospect, in that we were able to frame up the debate last week in the sense of, what future do we want," Priebus said this morning on "This Week."


“I think we can look back at last week as a campaign in a couple months 
and say, this was the defining week in both campaigns,” Priebus said 
earlier, “where I think both campaigns are crystallizing around a 
central theme, which is going to be, what kind of future do we want for 
our kids and grandkids? What type of America do we want for this 
country?”



On Monday, Mother Jones released secretly taped footage of Romney speaking at a fundraiser in Florida earlier this year in which he described 47 percent of voters as "victims," adding they are "dependent upon government" and "believe the government has a responsibility to care for them." Romney, who subsequently called his remarks inelegant, was bashed by Democrats. A number of prominent Republicans, including Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, distanced themselves from the remarks.

During my interview with Priebus, he conceded that last week was not the "best" of the campaign for Romney.

"I think Governor Romney's been pretty clear, it probably wasn't the best-said moment in the campaign and probably not the best week in the campaign," Priebus said.

I spoke to Obama campaign senior adviser David Axelrod right after my interview with Priebus and he quickly went after Romney for his "47 percent" comments.

"I don't know what prism he's looking through. I don't think anybody else would define it as a good week. But it was an enlightening week," Axelrod said. "The week began with Governor Romney basically slandering 47 percent of America, saying that they were, you know, hooked on dependency, didn't pay their taxes, and so on. "


For his part, Priebus went after
President Obama for being interviewed by Miami’s “Pimp with the Limp“ DJ Laz
from 106.7 WRMA-FM and meeting with Jay-Z and Beyonce. He also pushed back
against the suggestion that Romney needed to be more specific on the campaign trail.
“We’ve got specifics coming out of our eyeballs,” he said.

I know everything in life is relative. Priebus probably has a good premonition of how bad it's going to look like for the GOP on Nov 7!

t's not just his giant income or the low tax rates he pays on it. And it's not just the videotape of him berating almost half of America, or his endless gaffes, or his regressive budget policies.

It's something that unites all of this, and connects it to the biggest underlying problem America faces - the unprecedented concentration of wealth and power at the very top that's undermining our economy and destroying our democracy.

Romney just released his 2011 tax returns, showing he paid $1.9 million in taxes on more than $13 million of income last year - for an effective tax rate of 14.1 percent. (He released his 2010 return in January, showing he paid an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent.)

American has had hugely wealthy presidents before - think of Teddy Roosevelt and his distant cousin, Franklin D. Roosevelt; or John F. Kennedy, beneficiary of father Joe's fortune.

But here's the difference. These men were champions of the working class and the poor, and were considered traitors to their own class. Teddy Roosevelt railed against the "malefactors of great wealth," and he busted up the oil and railroad trusts.

FDR thundered against the "economic royalists," raised taxes on the wealthy, and gave average working people the right to form unions - along with Social Security, unemployment insurance, a minimum wage, and a 40-hour workweek.

But Mitt Romney is not a traitor to his class. He is a sponsor of his class. He wants to cut their taxes by $3.7 trillion over the next decade, and hasn't even specified what "loopholes" he'd close to make up for this gigantic giveaway.

And he wants to cut benefits that almost everyone else relies on - Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, food stamps, unemployment insurance, and housing assistance.

He's even a warrior for his class, telling his wealthy followers his job isn't to worry about the "47 percent" of Americans who won't vote for him, whom he calls "victims" and he berates for not paying federal incomes taxes and taking federal handouts.

(He mangles these facts, of course. Almost all working Americans pay federal taxes - and the federal taxes that have been rising fastest for most people are Social Security payroll taxes, which aren't collected on a penny of income over $110,100. Moreover, most of the "47 percent" whom he accuses of taking handouts are on Medicare or Social Security - the biggest "entitlement" programs - which, not incidentally, they paid into during their working lives.)

Money means power. Concentrated wealth at the top means extraordinary power at the top. The reason Romney pays a rate of only 14 percent on $13 million of income in 2011 - a lower rate than many in the middle class - is because he exploits a loophole that allows private equity managers to treat their income as capital gains, taxed at only 15 percent.

And that loophole exists solely because private equity and hedge fund managers have so much political clout - as a result of their huge fortunes and the money they've donated to political candidates - that neither party will remove it.

In other words, everything America is learning about Mitt Romney - his tax returns, his years at Bain Capital, the video of his speech to high-end donors in which he belittles half of America, his gaffes, the budget policies he promotes - repeat and reenforce the same underlying reality.

So much wealth and power have accumulated at the top of America that our economy and our democracy are seriously threatened. Romney not only represents this problem. He is the living embodiment of it.

The sad thing is thatthis idiot will be around in 2016 for the GOP. Whatever happen to Ron Paul? At least you could count on him to take a stand and defend it. Hell, Romney will not even tell the American people how he is going to cover the 5 trillion in new cuts.

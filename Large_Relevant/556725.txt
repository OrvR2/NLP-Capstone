Kiss - Arrests Made After Deadly Brazil Nightclub Fire












Police have arrested four men in connection with the horrific Brazil nightclub fire, which claimed at least 231 lives on Sunday (27Jan13).
Local authorities have detained the co-owner of the Kiss venue in Santa Maria where the deadly blaze broke out, as well as two bandmembers who were performing that night. Another co-owner handed himself in to police on Monday (28Jan13).
Investigators believe the pyrotechnics used onstage by local band Gurizada Fandangueira caused the fire, which quickly spread through the window-less venue as the panicked crowd tried to escape.
Funerals for the deceased began on Monday (28Jan13), while stars including Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj, Britney Spears and Axl Rose have sent their condolences to victims′ families.

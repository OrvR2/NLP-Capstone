No man. Floods with crocodiles in them are lethal. They had to tie them up before they escape. So they all tied them up to protect the people. The farms that raise crocodiles do so for﻿ their skins and meat from tails. It gives us jobs and money.

ofc they feel pain, actually just by touching them above water is very painfull for them, thats why many fisher men use gloves or handle in water if its not a keeper.
I imagine its stressing to catch so many crocks and if they have no room for them at that point its better to tie them up then they kill alot of wildlife bmo.
Iguanas r different from many other reptiles i think, maybe cuz they eat most veggies, they can actually be﻿ tame and think they have emotions on same level as rabbits.

The majority of﻿ the meat we consume in the west are handled worse.
And people are handled that way also sometimes for using there right of free speech, just saying to put things in perspective then can do alot of damage on local animal life.
And reptiles are cold blooded, they feel pain and stress but they also each other, they have not emotions as pigs and cows.

 . . . . or, crocodiles do not belong to people, just as blacks do not belong to whites, or women to﻿ men.

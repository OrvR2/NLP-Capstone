How dare you !  Point bullets.

“War has historically been humanity’s biggest killer.”
Eh? What happened to communicable disease? 
Flu alone killed as many people between 1918 and 1920 as were killed in the whole of WW2, and malaria currently carries off about 2 million a year.







Maxwell Lamb



Yeah, it’s a puff piece, and this one statement is the most patently false of the entire spiel. Mosquitos are humanity’s biggest killer. Well, protists are, but then you’re just splitting hairs.

You are bang on the money; and lost amidst the welter of global “facts” are the devastating implications for all but the most talented citizens of the Western economies. Concealed within the figure about those economies growing (over a carefully selected period) whilst its consumption of fossil fuels fell, is the fact that so many of the basic goods now bought are made elsewhere i.e. the fossil fuels responsible are being burned, for example, in China. What we have actually been living through is a fool’s paradise in which we have borrowed massively to support our welfare systems and buy very cheap goods made elsewhere. As a result, much of this shift having been brought about by Western multinationals chasing a competitive edge by relocating manufacturing, the kind of technological edge that the West used to enjoy has been dramatically eroded.
In short, whilst the good news enunciated above may result in a welcome reduction in the worldwide number of $1 a day people as more and more move into the $2,3,4,5 + a day band, the number of ordinary Westerners on, say, $150 a day will inevitably shrink as the work runs out. To all but the most cock-eyed optimists it is clear that this is already happening and when our historically acquired wealth and capacity to borrow at historically unmatched levels are both exhausted, the the enormous West-East cash-flows that have raised the boats of the $1 a day people will also end. 
So, all in all. this cheery Christmas piece must be regarded as one ginormous turkey.

This non sequitur is so uterly devoid of any logic that I should appreciate your permission to include it in the frontispiece of my forthcoming masterwork “Sexual Obsession and the Decline of the West”.






Shiori_Uyoku



Perfectly stated.

Dude, youre only talking about the United States, and a few other fiscally irresponsibe countries. This guy is Talking about the WHOLE WORLD, but i guess its typical american to think everyone is talking about you all the time. I live in Canada, we certainly have not “borrowed massively” as you put it, just because your government is incredibly stupid and borrows massive piles of money in China doesnt mean they are all that stupid. This guy was pointing out that GLOBAL progress is being made in all areas, He wasnt just talking about your sad little future United States of China, although I can see as a american how you would think that, as such near-sighted thinking is what got your country in the situation ts in in the first place. Yea eventually the US wil have to pay up to China, but americans seem to forget that there are 200 other countries on the planet, and a large portion of them would be just fine even if the US disappeared from the face of the Earth. So go ahead and think your own Western and american experiences are typical of the world in general. The rest of the world will continue to progress as it always has and if the US and all those money borrowing countries dont keep up, they will be left behind as we move into a new era and the so-called “Third World” becomes a thing of the past.

Dewreck — You didn’t miss anything. Gay-Ray is your run of the mill Canuck socialist. They should be happy we have protected them for so long and in so many wars.






Dewreck



Ah yes, the commie Canuck conglomeration.






http://www.facebook.com/joshuajkdunn                Josh Dunn



RIGHT! Cause we know how many wars Canada has gotten into, how many countries have invaded Canada… In actual reality, it was America that invaded Canada during the war of 1812. And Canada kicked our ass and burned the white house.






http://PalinsDirtyLittleSecret.blogspot.com/                ElectionFraudClick4Proof



You should feel robbed of democracy and free press after this last rigged election, coup, and REAL cover up. The whistle by my name exposes what the media cannot, the truth!

We don’t want your controlled opposition, mob rule- you government shill.

“ElectionFraud” is actually a sad little nutcase named Aaron, who wanders the discussion threads posting under an assortment of names, and pushing his paranoid conspiracy theory: that every news story is fiction churned out by teams of government writers, that Sarah Palin is an imaginary character invented by George Soros and the CIA, that Whitney Houston is still alive somewhere, and that Jimmy Carter is actually a dead real estate infomercial spokesman. (Apparently, that’s all supposed to tie together somehow.)
Of course, despite the CIA’s best efforts to shut him down, he and only he has had the remarkable insight to recognize the clear evidence staring us all in the face: that the names “Obama” and “Biden” share some letters with “Osama” and “bin Laden,” that Che Guevara’s name starts the same as “Che”-lsea Clinton’s, and (most ominous of all) that the name “Soros” is a PALIN-drome! (Get it? Palin?)
What he doesn’t explain is why, if they’re trying to cover something up, the CIA left all these “obvious” clues. Of course, anyone who points that out (like me, for example) is a highly-paid government troll working hard on the team assigned to silence him, just like the “secret agents” who were posing as coworkers at his carpet-cleaning job. Similarly, any story that he finds trivial is just government bread-and-circuses to distract us from “the TRUTH about the COUP and COVERUP.” This guy makes the Truther crazies look like a church sewing circle.
When he’s off his meds, Aaron links to his crazy little blog to just about every news story he sees, at least the ones the guys in the white coats will let him read between finger paint hour and pudding time. He’s usually on the right side of the issues on things, but he’s clearly got a few bulbs burnt out in his chandelier. (Then again, maybe HE is the government troll, working hard to make the anti-Obama position seem crazy. Hmmm…)
I encourage you to check out his site, not because there’s anything to it, but because it is the funniest damn thing you’ll read all day. But in the meantime, avoid “liking” his comments; it just feeds his delusions.






BajaDreamer



Don’t feed the SPAM troll!

then close your mouth






BajaDreamer



Try taking your own advice Aaron.  






Ihategovtcoverupclick4proof



When will the CIA finally take you???? I am NOW positive you do not have a job to read every story and post EVERY day. You MUST have no job or life and receiving welfare.






http://PalinsDirtyLittleSecret.blogspot.com/                2nd9/11ThwartedClickProfile



From what I read it appears the American people should take the CIA and the cowards online like you making threats against American citizens for exposing the REAL MEDIA BLACKOUT.






OlderWoman



And there you have it. A second new monicker for Aaron’s little conspiracy web site.






http://pulse.yahoo.com/_3A3EZTFMRMHUVN2DDPBWYMQ7XU                George



You need to get a new history book.






http://www.facebook.com/nigelstapuft                Brian White



And keep buying history books until ou find one that agrees with you.






matt2717



Umm,  I think it’s the British Army you’re blathering about…






BajaDreamer



Put down the bong and step back.






CONELRAD



Canada kicked our ass and burned the white house? Oh, God, we’re doomed.






NE_Heights_Elitist



Canada kicked our ass?  History disagrees with you.






gotham1883



Uh, we kicked their ass.  We won the war of 1812 and Canada was ruled by Great Britain who we defeated again.  Nobody gives a ratsass about Canada, not really.  A bunch of canucks and frogs






MarineDad



Dan, I’m a Canuck.  Have lived in the States for 32 years.  My kids have all been born in the States.  My eldest son is an active duty USMC officer.  Most of my extended family still lives in Canada. I can see both sides of the coin. I’m sure you are a friendly person, but your name calling is not an effective argument.  Growing up I had heard the same “we could take over your little country in 20 minutes” .  We felt safe because we recognized that most Americans would not be able to find Canada on a world map.(haha)  Lighten up, Dan.  We all need to cut the other person just a little bit of slack. The U.S. is  becoming one of the most bitter, angry and divided nations.  The internal decay that will most assuredly bring us down.






http://www.facebook.com/hunter.gooseman                Hunter Gooseman



yeah, thats why you came to the states – right?






MarineDad



Hunter -
Your reply was probably not a real question but I will answer it for you.  I am a descendant of at least nine patriots of the American revolution – some soldiers of the line and others state militia (NY, NC, RI, MA).  I may have more American heritage than you. This is the land of my heritage. Just so happened that some of my kin ended up in Canada in the early 1900′s and I was born there.  I live here because I love it here. I live here because I believe the United States is still a beacon of liberty to world.  I have taught my sons to defend it. That does not keep me from acknowledging that American “goodness”, appreciated by most nations, is greatly undermined by a zeitgeist of sarcasm and acrimony.

America has become a toilet. It’s best days ended in 2008. Sad, but true.

It’s about time we all blame ourselves; no character any more.






OIFAlumni



I blame the psycopath that commits the murder(s) and the shrill cry of the hypocritical gun grabbers that help set up these killings fields.






http://www.facebook.com/randyaford                Randy A. Ford



Just happened to receive the above article from a friend and started reading these comments and found yours to be the calmest and most accurate. Blame is everywhere; it’s a necessity whenever one lives in fear. The American culture has become a culture of fear, so selfishness has become the acceptable norm and blaming is the first rule of selfishness. 






StandUpAmerica59



I agree, the US is becoming bitter and divided. However, that is by design. It is part of the dismantling of America as we once knew it. Kruschev predicted this, and it has happened, or nearly so. It also happens to line up Biblically, as do many other world events. Not to say the end is near, only to say we are getting closer. The progressives, however, think all will be rosey. I also do not think the US is better than other countries, only that, for a time, the US was given the responsibility of helping police the world. But now, I am afraid the government is not in it only for themselves.






http://PalinsDirtyLittleSecret.blogspot.com/                2nd9/11ThwartedClickProfile



Divide and conquer, a government strategy to control the masses justifying it’s existence no different than the selling of fear






PatThe Rat



Nah, eventually the conservatives will rise up and get rid of the bitter liberals. The conservatives are just giving the liberals enough rope to hang themselves so that we can flush them all out of their hiding spots; then we’ll round them all up and send ‘em to Guatanamo Bay for “safe keeping”.






http://PalinsDirtyLittleSecret.blogspot.com/                2nd9/11ThwartedClickProfile



With the rest of the politicians responsible for 911 and the rogue CIA agents?






jDean



That’s fine with me – Guantanamo I mean!  The Liberal, Progressive Socialists are indeed terrorists as far as I am concerned. They should be able to relate well to the jihadists already there. Perhaps they will convert and no longer be infidels like many or most of us.






Mike Eck



Submitted to Fundies Say The Darndest Things to document the irrational, ignorant, misinformed, hateful, etc. comments of people on the fringes of society that deserve to be pushed over the edge, never to be heard from again, so that their ignorance and lack of reason is no longer spewed in an otherwise civil society.






SJA



Not going to happen Pat! So here’s an idea for you. Form a dialogue with them and stop trying to be right all the time and MAYBE you might actually solve something. Rather than do what you’re currently doing which is arguing about who broke the dishes on the Titanic. Just LOVE the amount of tolerance your statement made…Might be asking you a little too much to consider anyone’s POV other than your own though






steveb



Stop being right all the time ? That’s pretty good propaganda. So is the part of the “who broke the dishes of the Titanic”. Lefty destroys…then Lefty lies about it. Your leftist point of view is warped, illogical, destructive. It brings misery where ever it’s tried. Lefty cannot understand logic or common sense, and must be defeated. There is no middle ground with a philosophy that wishes to enslave people.

toldyaso



What have you been doing the last 12 years as all economic progress has stalled (for people, not corporations)… been lulling everyone to sleep with 2 “free” wars, gutting out rights with the Patriot Act, tax cuts while we are still in debt (marking the widest divide in American history of wealth and poverty), unfunded medicare entitlements. What was all that, just showing liberals how wrecking a country is done? Yeah, you sure “starved the beast.”






NE_Heights_Elitist



‘We felt safe because we recognized that most Americans would not be able to find Canada on a world map.’  This is the smug, inherited from-the-British attitude that many Americans hate about your people.






Gman32



And your assumption that many Canadians attitude towards Americans  comes from our British heritage (the same one you have), and not as a reaction to the way that a lot of Americans view Canada as a second-class nation when, especially in recent years, we’ve been your equal or better in most aspects of being a nation. It’s this blind, ignorant archaic-in-todays-world attitude of America being infallible and any criticism directed towards it being borne out of spite that makes most of the world hate your people. Oh, and as much as the jokes about Americans finding Canada on the map are stupid and tired, your education system is one of the worst in the developed world. So, not really an unfounded statement.






Northern_Witness



The U.S. is not interested in taking over Canada because that would result in 30 million new Democrats and keep the Republicans out of national office for the next few centuries. Plus, gun control would suddenly become acceptable.






SJA



We have guns up here too Northern Witness. In fact seeing you guys engage in the whole Conservative/Liberal mud tossing is actually quite the nice joke for us.

One need only look at the ungracious victory of the left who gloated and mocked the right for Obama’s reelection to understand  exactly why our country is becoming so bitter, angry and divided. Our ‘great uniter’ of a president is anything but.

OIFAlumni



It used to be their health care system, now it is just the Inuit and the Cree.






OlderWoman



Canada has a lot of problems. Google for them. I’m tired of hearing how great Canada is over the U.S. Meanwhile, they isolate themselves from the world unless they need something we have.






Northern_Witness



Canada is not isolationist but rather continues to expand its free trade agreements with other countries. Of course, the U.S. continues to rely on Canadian oil.






AugustineThomas



And Canada continues to rely on the U.S. not conquering them for their smart mouths..






Northern_Witness



The U.S. doesn’t want smart people. That is the smart Merkins become Canadian citizens.






AugustineThomas



Typical leftist. Doesn’t understand the difference between a smart mouth and a smart brain..






http://www.facebook.com/nigelstapuft                Brian White



We’re all commies up here. Our biggest exports are tie-dyed t-shirts, hookahs and oil, which you chaps seem to want in great abundance. I had thought our relationship was based on shared values and common goals; thanks for correcting me with the knowledge that it’s really based on the US protecting us lazy, defenseless bums.It was the convoys(Canadian) across the Atlantic that kept the British alive. Otherwise who knows what language you would be speaking now? As for WW2, I had an uncle killed at Dieppe, long before the US entered the war. I’m just sick and tired of Americans preaching about being the only beacon of light in the world.

The DrudgeReport.com has linked to this article. Please keep this in mind when reviewing these posts and understand that this vocal group doesn’t represent the view of most Americans….






http://www.facebook.com/lisa.thompson.5688                Lisa Thompson



drudgereport.com is not a vocal group and they don’t write the articles. It’s a news aggregation service. All it does is post links to other websites so you can read what so-called journalists and newspapers publish. Your ridiculous post is proof that you have probably never been to the sight or you have the attention span of a carrot or you would have noticed that the links bring you to many different sites. Good grief…I can’t believe people can be so ignorant!

Drudge is one of the, if not the most visited site on the web. What most Americans are you talking about?

That’s why he gets a BILLION hits per month, I guess…  ALSO, retard….  Drudge doesn’t write the stories, he only links from other news …   I am never sure what you clones mean when you talk smack about the Drudge “group”…. If I read an article from ABC linked from Drudge, I am exposed to all the articles on the ABC site…  That seems to be a multiplier in favor of “smart”…   I think you are the stupid one, stuck in your talking point shell….   Go read Daily KOS, or reread “How to Please Obama with a Koolaid Swirly”….






NE_Heights_Elitist



and please understand that you don’t speak for all Americans either.






steveb



You are a mindless slave, a know nothing repeating talking points given to you from your slave masters. You were told Drudge was “bad”, and you vomit out the lies you were told. It’s much easier to not think, and just believe every lie they feed you, isn’t it? You are weak, spineless, a slavebot devoid of all logic, common sense, laying in the fetal position waiting for your slave masters to tell you what to think.






roder005



Well, I’m American and have found the US military goes around kicking ass because there is either oil, minerals, or a reason to overturn the existing government to make a new enemy. We can’t survive without an enemy. Nor can we survive without stealing the world’s oil and mineral supplies. We are only going in to certain regions of Africa now, but only if there is a dastardly leader (or oil and minerals). There is no profit in peace. We are the world beacon of freedom and that is why we are so hated. We say we are fighting for freedom and the citizenry buys that line of crap. We tend to watch TV all day, too, when we aren’t working. I am sooooo sorry for us. My apologies, Canada.






mikewaller



There was a rather wonderful American top sergeant who on arriving in Kuwait for the first Iraqi war, was asked on TV “Have you come because of the oil?” His reply? “Put it his way, if they grew carrots we won’t be here”.

Sounds like envy or jealousy to me. You are one of those people that likes to stereotype a whole country of citizens based on 1 or 2 posts that you disagree with and you don’t even know what country the posts are from. Sounds like you have issues. Personally, I would be thankful if all of the countries out there that receive monetary help from the US, would not receive said monetary help any more. More than 1/2 of US citizens don’t believe in what our govt is doing so don’t blame ALL Americans for your issues. We have enough idiots here at home that we have to deal with. BTW, if your country is so wonderful, why do lots and lots of Canadians, including the minister for Labrador, come here for their heart & other surgeries? I’ll tell you, it’s because they would die at home waiting in your country. Now we’re going to have the same corrupt BS socialist system that you have so maybe you will stay home in Canada.






http://PalinsDirtyLittleSecret.blogspot.com/                2nd9/11ThwartedClickProfile



too many people unhappy with the truth leaking out about Obama, that’s all.






K M



Brian White, NO OTHER country in the history of the world has brought so much light and hope to others around the world as America….  It’s sad you can never understand what “American exceptionalism” actually means.    That term belongs to everyone, from any country,  that desires to partake of the freedom and opportunities she was FOUNDED upon….    Just “saying” your country is great is little more than cheerleading.   When you develop a country in a 300 year time span that has changed (and protected) the world for the sake of good and prosperity, you can have bragging rights.  Until then, you should stop asking her for help when the other “exceptional” powers try to take over….






Raman_Indian_123



From the viewpoint of the African slaves and the exterminated Indians and the populations in Latin America who have lived and perished under US-backed murderous despots this seems correct.
Incidentally not even Mr Obama agrees.






USA USA USA USA USA USA



Bravo!!






NE_Heights_Elitist



Give me a break!  You act as if Germany would have taken over America without old Canada protecting us.  Yawn.






Northern_Witness



Of course, we should remember the Canadian navy which ensured the survival of the Atlantic convoys and the U.S. And, let’s not forget the War of 1812  in which we kicked U.S. butt. Oh yes, the Canadian pipelines that supply the U.S. with oil.






NE_Heights_Elitist



Kicked US butt?  If I recall the war ended on your soil.  You may have kicked butt at first, but you got yours handed to you later on.  One has to love revisionist, PC, Canadian history.






Northern_Witness



At the Treaty of Ghent (which ended the War of 1812) everything went back to what is was before the U.S. invasion. All was naught – a lesson the U.S. didn’t learn in time for Viet Nam. 
Incidentally, the Treaty returned to the U.S.  40,000 square kilometers of territory around Lakes Superior and Michigan and in Maine that it had lost to the forces defending Canada. We should not have been so generous because the Merkins are too self-absorbed to be appreciative.

http://www.facebook.com/jchelwig                Joe Helwig



the point he was making is the US is borrowing Money so it can be sent to Other Countries (through Aid or the buying of goods) that are these developing nations, when our economy breaks down so will their prosperity, If they allow the economy to go over this so called “Fiscal Cliff” that the media made up, watch and see what happens to the world’s economy…BTW You can not even compare the US economy to Canada’s, Canada does not break the top 10 in the world. I am not saying our leaders are not stupid for borrowing like they do, read the whole post next time….






antiobamanation



maybe if we stop sending aid to muslim countries who hate us






robinnj



thanks for the assist. I failed to mention that as well…..in my rebuttal






Pete



True, Canada hasn’t borrowed as much as the United States, but take into account that there are only 34.5 million people living in Canada, and your country has borrowed $601B to finance your governmental expenditures, I would say that your assertions are incorrect, based on the fact that all I had to do was Google what you said and disprove it.  And way to go not lumping Canada into other, “westernized democracies.”  No, you’re right, Canada bears no resemblance to the United Kingdom, France, or even the United States.  Thought-provoking analyses.  You should work for some think-tank.






antiobamanation



and canada is rich in natural resources, much higher per capita,..huge dif….may not be universally true,.but we personally know many canadiens who come here for specialist treatment.






delong003



They won’t have to for very long—-Obamacare will take care of that.  We’ll get the same crap of medical care as what they do now.

Their health care leaves a lot to be desired. And I also believe they have hate crime legislation that has been passed. If this is true, Big Brother lives there.

Unelected officials took over Washington and the media after a coup and cover up. Most comments online are financed with our tax dollars. They are trying to create the perception of public opinion and bury the truth about this last rigged election. They think you can’t handle the truth. Learn what the media cannot report on leaked in my name. It’s sick, twisted, and you’ll likely never pay taxes again after you read it.

Ray, you misguided canadian. The fact of the matter is “we” the people of the United States have had our government overrun with communists and socialists slowly and incrementally eroding our way of life here. We are not stupid Americans, we are battling a media that covers for them and throws the race card at anyone who stands up to them. Obama should not have won re-election, by any means. But when an outsider like George Soros has a stake in the election machines and the “dead” folks are allowed to vote, and we are forced into a trans national nation, we are divided by these idiots running the show, whether they are in our government or on the outside pulling strings. So before you open your canadian pie hole you’d remember that. This recent school shooting is just TOO tidy to be real. With drunk driving killing more per year than mass shootings, it’s just funny how they have ramped up during the last 5 years. When they take our guns, we will be done, they know that. AND if you think I am wrong about it, just look at the STATS in Washington, D.C. where they banned guns. ONLY the criminals and cops have guns and they STILL have murders by gun. SO it doesn’t work. Just as outlawing BOOZE didn’t work. canada had NO problem exploiting that back during prohibition and helping with smuggling up in the Chicago area……ok eh?

Clearly, you don’t know what Socialism, Communism or Capitalism are. Also D.C. did not ban guns, there were no cases of major voter fraud in the last election or in recent U.S. history, Romney also “had a stake in election machines” By all rights Obama SHOULD have been reelected. Incumbents nearly always win, he led in every poll the entire time and the Republicans generated so much ill will against themselves during the Bush Admin for the epic bungling in all matters foreign and domestic. You’re not stupid, you’re deranged if you believe that nonsense.






robinnj



Josh, of course I know the difference, but YOU don’t. NO president under the circumstances of HIGH unemployment alone would survive. Carter anyone? When Obama on TAPE for all to see on you tube says he wants to have a single payer system for healthcare what do you think he’s talking about? He has employed people around him that are KNOWN communists VAN JONES anyone? I won’t dignify your claim about Romney as that is typical to always throw the blame to someone else. You should be asking yourself why blacks have not improved their lifestyle after 50 years of loyal voting to Democrats. Democrats who by the way have led the way for Jim Crow, segregation and were stalling civil rights. It’s history. Can’t change that, unless you’re Howard Zinn.
I thought the black community wanted a better life, but they voted for Obama because they could vote FOR someone instead of against. Even knowing his past. I bet you’re the guy who led the charge to expose the “pranks” of a young Mitt Romney but was no where to found when talking about Obama’s admitted drug use and “chooming.” You voted for the User, I voted for the typical American boy down the street who made pranks. BIG difference. Obama has NO law license, Michelle has NO law license, WHY? He didn’t let it lapse. Show what lawyer lets it lapse after going through so much to get it. He lied on his application. After his book came out, they truth about drugs is what nailed him. You can’t put on your app, that you didn’t use drugs and then a few years later publish you did. Michelle got busted for insurance fraud and surrendered hers. You’re done, Dunn.






legend zero



Too true. Democrats have overseen the destruction of the Black community, family and babies. They have enslaved them to the master that is government. When Blacks were conservatives they had a 90% legitimacy rate, a high school graduation rate that paralleled the other races and were constantly improving their communities. Now they have a near 90% illegitimacy rate, a laughable graduation rate and their communities are in the toilet. Since Roe V Wade, in the United States, more black babies have been aborted  than have been born. That’s called Eugenics and it was started by democrats.

Koch bros.?   Soros is the big Dr Evil in the room. You can try and pass off Koch bros. all you want, but with the Liberal Media, Liberal Hollywood and the Soros’ and the U.N. I think the Koch bros are small in comparison to the threat from Communist and Socialists who are really the infestation we have. I guess you agree with Harry Belafonte’a reasoning to arrest me and everyone else that doesn’t agree with your politics? He’s on your side, he speaks for you to you know. Regarding The Koch Bros., I would rather be working for them as “henchman” than to be on the side of the Globalists (Dr Evils of the world).






OlderWoman



Actually it had nothing to do with Romney. No one lost the election and no one won it. There was massive voter fraud committed by liberals in PA, Ohio, Indiana and Virginia. Some democrats voted more than once. Black churches in those states voted multiple times. They bussed in illegal aliens to vote.






Mr. Rational



Romney lost. Get over it. Unless you can actually provide some proof of such wild claims, how about keeping quiet?






OlderWoman



Keeping quiet?  So Interesting you said that. You can’t stand it when faced with the truth. It wrecks your liberal fairy tale. You wouldn’t tell me to keep quiet unless you knew I was being truthful.






Mr. Rational



Faced with what truth? You have no evidence or proof, you are just shooting off your mouth. The fact of the matter is that Obama getting elected TWICE kills the conservative fairy tale of a country that minorities will never rule….Obama is a minority that was voted into office twice by minorities, and it just drives you conservatives crazy……..drink it in, its called diversity and its what makes this country great….






OlderWoman



yes minorities and dwl’s multiple voted….voter fraud allowed this fake to remain in the White House. You’re the one whose shooting his mouth off.






Mr. Rational



So, respecting that we just had an election with a clear winner is “shooting my mouth off”, but someone with crackpot conspiracy theories to explain why their horrible candidate didn’t get elected is the credible one?….ok, if you say so…..still waiting for your evidence

This argument has no merit, as these countries aren’t involved in the conflicts America is. The vast overwhelming majority of American conflicts are a direct result of aggressive, militant foreign policy. Also, WWII provided that an industrial nation doesn’t need a large standing army, they can just build one. Look at the amount of military equipment and personnel  the US had in 1941 vs 1945. Also, Canada kicked America’s ass in the War of 1812.

By why do we insist others should decide how prosperous Indonesia, Botswana, and Cambodia become? Leave them alone, lassez faire at it’s finest… the more we interfere, the poorer the world is.

Do you really believe that Canada, Mexico and the US are not economically joined?  Canuck bucks are worth even less than our US monopoly money.  As a participant in the Federal Reserve’s monetary fantasy, Canada- just like the US and basically every ‘civilized’ nation in the world- is in over its head in phony derivative garbage.  It is naive to believe that Canada somehow evaded this situation.  We’re all in the same boat now.
The North American Union may have been silenced, but it was never stopped.  When the new, global currency is rolled out, people like you will praise the UN as saviors, just as they planned.
Wake up.

I live in the United States and I do agree with you. We have borrowed so much money from China we have dug a huge hole. If we have just stayed out if these 20 different wars we are in and minded our own business things may looked brightener but now our egos have got the best of us. I love my country but fear my government.
If we hadn’t outsources all of our jobs we wouldn’t be heading for massive collapse but we are already there.

Wow.  You sir, are an uninformed idiot.  The other countries would be just fine without the US huh?  Wrong.  Look up statistics on how much foreign aid the US provides.  None of that is “paid back” to us.  All the “charity” the U.N. provides….well the U.S. funds 75% of that.  Comments like yours make me want the US to just annex Canada and say “Do something punks?”  Whatcha gonna do?  Fucking bow down.  You’re lucky we aren’t like the British.  They’d have taken your country about 150 years ago.  Another think you don’t understand is America could just say “fuck you China”.  Come try to take your money.  That would fix all of our “fiscal” problems.  What’re they going to do? Attack us?  Nope.  Bottom Line:  If the ENTIRE world declared war on the US we could kill almost every living person on the planet within a month and just have us sitting here without a few major cities after a few russian nukes got through.  If they did.  Point:  The world lives because we are benevolent.  Oh, and fuck you.

Wimps like you should be kissing our feet, but you know you and your country are lesser countries then the greatest country to ever exist, and probably will ever exists.

I am British which rather suggests that your world view is utterly dominated by US-Canadian relations this being the only prism through which you can see anything..






Michael Chiasson



“Americans seem to forget that there are 200 other countries on the planet, and a large portion of them would be just fine even if the US disappeared from the face of the Earth. ”
It’s not my nature to be thumping my chest in patriotic displays.  But it is a simple fact that the entire planet benefits from the presence of the US here.  It’s the US that drives the technological pace of the planet.  Without growth derived from US innovations, like “fracking” and countless other developments, the planet would be at zero growth according to a recent study.  We drive progress in medical research for instance.
         We also serve to assure that bullies around the world are kept in check.  Europe would be under German or Soviet domination today if not for our intervention.  But I understand your resentment.  Its difficult to live in the shadow of a world power that could crush you in a heart-beat if we ever felt the need.  Canadians are like the mouse dropped into the enclosure of a python snake.   You know you can only survive until the hour when the snake gets really, really hungry. I’m guessing that the mouse bears a lot of resentment.






biggcatt1



Well spot on eexceept for a couple points. One many even some of our biggest detractors wouldd miss us. Who still drives the world economy? Who would replace us as relatively benevolent hhegemons? For all our flaws the us is still an overwhelming force for good in the world. Second other than the las t 2 orr 3 hundred years has the world generally progressed? And what nation and its ideals has been present during that time? Of course correlation is not causation. But it is good to see america doesnt have the only abysmal school system.






PlutarchinAmerica



Right.  Canada’s debt to GDP ratio is over 85% (higher than, for example, that of Spain), and it’s only as low as that because of an unsustainable boom in tar sands exports.  Please, don’t break your arm patting yourself on the back.  
Canada is marginally better off than the US because it free rides on US defense spending and benefits from our insatiable demand for oil, but with over 73% of Canada’s exports going to the US, Canada’s future will continue to rise and fall in relative lock-step with ours.

Actually, the USA has a pretty good relationship with China. If it wasn’t for our “senseless” consumerism, their economy wouldn’t be growing nearly as fast. You think too much in terms of debt and money. It really doesn’t matter as much as people think. Growth = confidence = prosperity.
The USA is also giving China plenty of mineral rights in Afghanistan, as well as letting them build ports in the Americas even after the Monroe Doctrine.

So many words, so little substance. Allow me to give future readers a summary of this assault on logic and grammar that you’ve bestowed upon us:
1) While it may be true that we are using less fossil fuels, this is in part due to our outsourcing of manufacturing initiatives to places like China. As manufacturing is rising in those places, so is their usage of fossil fuels, and that is bad.
2) Global economic progress is destined to be stymied by the exhaustion of “our acquired wealth and capacity to borrow.”

Bade



Oh man, so much Canadian hate, too funny. Let’s go through some of these just for fun.
Canadian dollar is worthless? Worth 1.02 American at the time of this post. Suck it  
Healthcare is garbage? Why’s our infant mortality rate and average lifespan higher? Maybe because your healthcare system is the worst in the developed world for anyone outside the top 1%? Also you spend more on healthcare per capita than we do and yet only cover 1/3 as much. Hilarious.
You defend us with your military? Against? Who’s looking to invade Canada? Iraq? That’s the last place you invaded, I think we can take Iraq. Oh wait, I forgot, this is just standard US paranoia “oh man if it weren’t for our bloated military everyone would invade us all at once, even Europe because dirty foreigners are jealous of us!” No one wants your country. Trust us.
“Canada is irrelevant, not even a top 10 economy!” Actually it’s number 10, seriously, took me two seconds to look it up. Granted India will pass us in probably less than 5 years, but still. We’re the 10th largets economy in the world and our GDP per Capita is better than yours. Meaning if we had the same population as you, we’d have a bigger economy. 
Basically, we have a better quality of life, a better economy, and are better respected internationally (though our current PM took a page out of you lot’s crazy book and is trying his damnedest to ruin that).
One I particularly laughed at: “If we were the British we’d have conquered you 150 years ago”. Oh yes, the British are all over the place conquering stuff these days :p. Also the British didn’t need to conquer us 150 years ago, we were a British colony and we’re still part of the commonwealth you uneducated simpleton. Also America tried to do exactly that 200 years ago and we kicked your asses. Come at us bro.  
You’re basically the nation-equivalent of the big stupid bully who reacts to everything with “yeah? well… I CAN BEAT YOU UP” instead of trying to succeed in anything that actually matters. You’re the Biff Tannen of the world. We’re the George McFly. The war of 1812 was that one punch, y’know, where we burned the White House to the ground   How’s the new one working out?

So now we are picking out one century and claiming it is an accurate representation of all human history?  Wars is a broad term and I think many people don’t get counted in deaths related to “wars.”  There is no good way to extrapolate how many people have actually died from declared wars, much less skirmishes or ongoing fighting (like the drug “war” in Mexico right now.  Untold thousands and perhaps millions have died through wars and battles.  It isn’t a blatant lie of falsehood to say war has historically been out biggest killer but perhaps if he changed it to “violence” I would be more accurate.  Don’t forget that some people died of certain communicable diseases directly related to wars, which side should those count for?

Though I morally object to the practice, I will not interfere with your Right to Choose™. As long as there is a buck in it. Come right this way.









Sabrina Bruning



Mostly, I think the difference here is a semantic one. People “kill” other people but they “die” from disease. Also, war is controllable by man, whereas disease we can only *try* to prevent/treat but may not always be successful.







Amy



I remember that there is a term called biological weapons that ‘scientists’ are creating…yes its kind of war in ‘peace’ and silence.. and. People dye without knowing why and how. Yes more poor people die the less poorers and the survivers will be in ‘best years ever’…

I want to add that AIDS is a disease made in laboratory been spread out to reduce population… look…most Africans dead for that. Go and do research. YES there is time for the positive statements but this is time to say the truths.

heloo



hmm… probably we should worry about over population now.







Flyguy



Actually, the pop will begin to contract in 50 years…due to fewer kids, longer waits, educated women.  so rejoice!!







Eddie



Highly unlikely, that.
The population will only begin to stabilise when Nature takes its course, and human nature too, and disease, starvation and conflicts kill millions off. Too late, that, for all the many species that will be extinct by then.
Educating a few women in the third world really won’t make all that much difference – and anyway, isn’t is arrogant colonialisation for us to expect women in Africa and Asia to behave like Western women (with their broken families, lonely lives, messed up kids)?







Dave



There is direct correlation between educating women, infant mortality and the slowing of population growth. You can claim it’s ‘highly unlikely’ all you want, it’s a well known fact to numerous bodies and anyone that knows what they’re talking about and has been for years.






Eddie



So now you Dave are saying a future that hasn’t happened yet is a fact because you want it to be so. Brilliant!
I did NOT deny that there is such a correlation anyway. But it will not reduce numbers by much, and will go against the instincts of tribal primitives who want large families (as many immigrants do in the UK too). 
You do not know what you are talking about and are so damn arrogant to think your plan to educate third world women will save the world. It won’t.
The left thinks educating women is the magic bullet (guess what – it isn’t). The capitalist right thinks that making everyone capitalist and developed will do the same. It won’t. Black Africans and Asians in London and their kids often have 4,5,6,7,8, children. The only solution is forcible population limits – yet human beings are so selfish that they will breed the human race into disaster before thinking about taking action.
The world in 100 years will be a horrid place in which to live because of population growth – all large animals extinct, seas empty, forests destroyed – as David Attenborough has stated. I think he knows more than you – the great ‘Dave’ who thinks he can extrapolation predicts the future as fact! Ho ho ho!
Your theory collapses in the face of facts.
In a few years the disastrous 7 billion population we have allowd to happen (by giving aid ro over-breeding third world beggars, for example) will double. Maybe a few hundred thousand babies won’t be born because their mothers are educated – though that is rather arrogant colonialisation racist attitude, by the way, and would be seen as such in much of the black and brown continents. 
Look at Population Matters and educated yourself, silly!






Victor



Black and brown continents?
Let me guess, you’re going to start talking about “deepest, darkest Africa” now and talk about your friend Joseph Conrad too?
No wonder you’re such a disgusting racist. You’re from the 1890s.






Eddie



Victor – FUCK OFF you self-righteous pompous snotty little cock!
Fact is – the black and brown continents means the places where overpopulation happens and women have multiple babies each: Africa, Asia and South America. If it were Norway, I might say the blond fairckinned continents.
Now go kill yourself, you paedo!
Not a paedo> Never mind,. You called me a racist for expressing a non-racist opinion, so as far as I am concerned, you are a proven child abuser ( am using your logic here – ie no evidence whatseoever).

http://twitter.com/CallenFamily                Callen



The medical profession kill a fair few too – at least as many as die from natural disease, if anyone is still allowed to.






Eddie



Yes indeed. 
And perhaps the biggest tragedy is that we allow populations to increase unrestrained in Africa and Asia, and then do not let Nature do what it should do to keep population numbers stable: kill off half the babies born – this in places where women have 4,5 or 6 kids each is NOT a bad thing. Because all that happens when we dogooding Westerners and our medicine save all the little black babies is that 1) the countries hate us for giving them aid; 2) the babies grow up to mother/father several more babies each. 
That is why the world population is now over 7 billion – double what it was in the late 60s. That is why the environment is under so much pressure and many species are nearing extinction. And at least half of all wars are caused by population increase which has caused fighting over scarce resources (water, land, food, minerals, etc). Population control will come naturally is we don;t act.
Every year is worse than the one before – because the human population keeps on rising to levels that will detroy so much of what makes life worthwhile.
But I am optimistic – I am absolutely 100% sure that things are going to get a LOT worse.
Merry Christmas!







morskimacek



What the hell are you going on about? Gates foundation proved that if you stop infant mortality, the growth rate of the population stabilizes. People only have 10 kids if it’s expected that 7 of them will die before they reach 15. Think about that.







Eddie



Nonsense! The population of the world has increased because in Asian and African countries it has quadrupled in the last 40 years – because medical science saves many babies that Nature should kill, frankly.
You are a typical short-termist. African countries still have 4,5,6,7+ babies per woman – even after all the UN aid and charity billions. The Africans in London behave in the same over-breeding way.
The Bill Gates foundation would do the world a favour if they sprayed Africa with sterilisation chemicals. What they are doing is immoral and will damage the world badly in the decades to come – when the population will be even double the disastrous 7 billion it is now.
I would prefer that enough babies died so that the populations of these countries did not rise at all but were stabilised. That is, if you like, being cruel to be kind – a long-term intelligent approach.
Your facts are wrong and your thinking simplistic, like most people. Me, I’d prefer animal species to survive and populations to be forcibly controlled. Otherwise, the mass populations in future will cause massive disease, starvation and war after war after war (over resources).
I get sick of religious Americans too (and others) promoting population growth. We all love a cuddly baby – but imagine how overpopulated the world would be if we had no contraception or didn’t use it.







Freeflight



Funny how you don’t even realize all those double-standards you are applying there. You are saying Nature should have it’s way with the poorer populations of Africa and Asia, because it’s all their fault for overpopulating the place.
Yet you do not even realize that this responsibility falls to every population on this planet. Do you honestly believe that the immense jumps in average Life expectancy in the western world do not also fuel overpopulation? How about we let Nature have it’s way in the western world? No more cancer treatments (shit is expensive), no more palliative care (even more expensive), no more vaccination for the general population, no more special care for elderly who can’t pull their own weight.
Instead you claim to speak about “facts” while ignoring well established scientific facts. Facts like models of population growth that show a direct correlation between birth rates and living conditions. If a population is living in an harsh and hostile environment, it’s natural reaction is to overpopulate (to compensate for the higher mortality). If the environment is stable and secure, populations usually have an easier time staying on stable and sustainable levels.
That’s why most western countries have seen a drastic reduction in birth rates over the past few decades, with the negative side-effect of putting the age pyramid on it’s head. A growing population of older people (that get older with every medical breakthrough) has to be supported and cared for by a much smaller part of the population, the newer generations that have far weaker birth rates. That in itself presents another serious problem that also keys into overpopulation.






Eddie



Yes, but the reduction in birth rates which will happen in a VERY limited and slow way with the development of third world countries and giving women control over breeding is but a drop in the ocean to what’[s needed.
Anyone who thinks either of those is the solution is an idiot.
You ignore all scientific FACTs – such as the one that the population has doubled in 45 years, and that vast numbers of species are near extinction. You clealry do not realise the scale of the problem in your ignorance.
The population of post-colonial countries like Kenya has quadrupled in 50 years thanks for medicine and foreign aid. This has caused tribal conflict and the annihilation of species. Soon the babies in Africa you and your sentimentalist mentalist mates want to save and thus quadruple population numbers again will eat their bush meat until the last gorilla is killed and all the great beasts gone from Africa. The blame for that will rest will you and all people who have given aid to Africa and Asia so all the little babies can live.
The truth often hurts: but the only way to save our world is to stop all foreign aid, to allow nature to kill many babies who are born in countries where women have 5-10 babies each, and thus to halt our man-made apocalypse. If we don’t Nature will do it for us anyway.
Now, I really do not care if you or anyone else disagrees with me or calls me names. I know I am right – and the future will prove me right too.






http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1533787308                Russ Ramey



You are sadly too amusing. The past has not proven you right, experience and history have not proven you right, most of your “facts” have not even been proven right. Science in your case has been politicized to fit a statist/militant environmentalist agenda. Regardless, your nor any other pointed headed committee has the legal, moral, or ethical right to decide for everyone else… You are a primary example of the clear and present danger your thinking poses to the future of humanity. You have always existed, and we shall always oppose you.






Daniel



Palliative care is not more expensive than curative treatments.  FAR less, as they use very, very old drugs–not the newest, most expensive stuff.  (Been a hospice RN for years.






Victor



You are so idiotic it’s not even funny. So if you’re trolling; it’s not funny.
First of all, advocating the death of babies is just sick, and you disgust me. Second of all, I can’t help notice you’re an enormous fucking racist. You’re not special just because you’re not black, and thinking you are is just sad. Sorry, but live with your own accomplishments, don’t ride it out on the success of your brilliant not-being-African.
Anyway, you’re worried about overpopulation. Yeah, overpopulation is a serious issue. However, at current rates we won’t even reach 9 Billion people until 1950, so no, it’ll be a long time before we hit “double our current 7 billion.” Further still, we currently do have enough food for everyone in the world plus livestock, but the majority of that food is being wastefully consumed or else dumped by Western countries. Do you really think that it’s okay to be complicit in the deaths of millions of babies, that it’s okay to forcibly sterilise entire nations, just because John or Mary want another cheeseburger?
How about this – every time you see someone eating food that they want, but that they don’t need, (just an indulgent snack or something) you subtract the same amount of calories in that snack from your intake that day. Because, assuming you live in the US or the UK, you would starve to death very, very quickly if you did that. This is the current state of the world – overpopulation is a problem worth considering, but it is, currently, manageable, if humanity wanted to manage it.
Anyway, the Gates foundations reports are both true and valid – not just a short term problem (think about it; during and following the black death in Europe, it was extremely common for families to have upwards of 5 or 6 children; it’s not just an ‘african’s are horny’ problem like you seem to think, it’s just a natural human response to fear of infant mortality) but also prime reasons for having multiple children that’s not related to infant mortality? Education and welfare.  The stronger these developing nations become, economically, the better their education systems will be. The better educated they are, the more they’ll realise that their own economies, welfare systems, etc. can’t support multiple children, and also the more they’ll want freedom to work and make money and live more luxurious lives anyway, and birth rates will plummet. It’s exactly what happened across the entire Western world over the past century – people realised that with good education and good jobs, capitalism allows them to live more luxurious lives where they don’t have to rely on their 6 children to take care of them in old age, and what do they do? They decide to make the best of those lives and maybe only have 2 kids.
This is especially true when it comes to women’s equality, because now women can choose to work rather than stay at home as glorified incubators. So a lot of them choose to work. But you know what allows nations to reach this point where people can live happy lives and women can work? Education, and growing economies. Therefore we should encourage the growth of developing nations, because it will be better for them in the end, as they have a better standard of living, and it will be better for us in the Western nations, because we will no longer have to worry about dramatically increasing populations, being responsible for the deaths of millions of people every year simply through wanting to live luxuriously, and generally all of the stupid ‘white man’s burden’ shit that you think we’d have learned to get over after so many years.
I could probably go on and on, but I only came to this article to try and feel at least a little good about there world, even if it was wilfully ignorant of certain facts… You however, are the biggest argument against our world being a ‘good’ world that I’ve seen all week.






Victor



One minor correction:
Won’t reach 9 billion until 2050.
1950… Damn. Showing my age.






Eddie



That is a prediction – an extrapolation based on present trends. It is NOT a fact!
I do wish all you self-appointed experts on this would realise that the future and all predictions for it are not true!
However, we can safely say the following: the population will rise massively amd most major animal species will become extinct because of it. Moreover, there will be many more conflicts over resources – though half the world’s wars at present are caused by limited populations fighting over limited resources.
Most people will not see a problem with this until it is too late. That is because they are selfish (they want to breed) and stupid: and are thus betraying future generations with their selfish greedy attitudes and behaviours.
Nature will limit population if we do nothing, so limiting population now is being cruel to be kind if you like, and what any responsible government would do. We do not have responsible governments – we have governments that bribe people to vote for them with massive benefit payments for breeders and overseas aid.
The left says giving women righst will stop popution growth.
The right says allowing everyone everywhere to be capitalists until they become just like us and developed will halt it.
Both are wrong. Populations will conitnue to rise and rise until the world is not worth living in.
My opinion is exactly the same as David Attenborough’s and many other eminent scientists too – so all the sanctimonious PRATS like you who condemn me, are also condemning them. Your attempt to bully has failed, you disgusting little idiot!
Advocating the NATURAL death of babies is RESPONSIBLE – or are you one of those catholics who see every sperm as sacred.
Now fuck off and die – and do the world a favour.

Eddie makes my point, the pointy headed little statists know best for everyone else. As a country prospers, population stabilizes. Freedom and liberty under the rule of law are the best poverty and disease reduction programs of all. Never, ever trust someone who knows what is better for everyone else than the individual. Again, liberty under the rule of law-not fang and claw anarchy.

“save all the little black babies”
I think Eddie wants to kill all the little black babies, and forcibly sterilise all the little black teenage girls.
Eddie missed the opportunity to join the SS you see.  Because he was born too late and is also a physical and mental weakling so would have been gassed.

Eddie



And moral sewers are full of Russes.
Only morons and the ignorant followers of outdated ideologies (socialism, free marker mania) thin overpopulation is not a problem.
Let Nature take its course.
It is IMMORAL to save the lives of  babies in Africa so they can grow up and breed  the world to death – make all species extinct, destory the environment, and create massive overpopulation which leads to disease, war, starvation, misery.
The moral high ground is mine, not yours.

You know, treating a person as expendable destroys much of what makes life worthwhile for that person. Everything in fact. Who decides who lives and who dies? Well we know none of the “Over-population” zealots are lining up for voluntary extermination, so I guess they will be the ones deciding for the rest of us. 
People who believe the world is overpopulated should lead by example and kill themselves. This would lead to a lower population and you could all save the planet and die heroes.
Also, I don’t think the environment is under that much “pressure”. How would you know? Been talking to its therapist? The environment has been killing people wholesale since humans emerged on this planet. Heard of Hurricane Sandy? How about Katrina? In fact the environment is the single biggest enemy humanity has got, and must be dominated at all costs.

Why does malaria kill so many.  The root cause is the banning of use of DDT.  Rachel  Carson book  Silent Spring led to banning of DDT.  She is credited with killing more people than anyone without an army.  DDT almost eradicated the mosquito, the carrier of malaria.  Carson was the first in a long line of environmental wackos.

You are way off when it comes to malaria. According to WHO the number of deaths from malaria in 2010, the latest year for which they have numbers, the number dying is about 660,000. And the number of deaths is dropping.

Without disputing the truth of what you said (that preventable communicable disease is by far the biggest killer of humans), your choice of the Spanish Flu was probably not a good one, since the primary vector by which non-immune populations were exposed to it was…. returning servicemen from WWI, whose demobilisation caused the flu pathogen to breach what would otherwise be natural geographical limitations.
So the Spanish flu is yet another consequence of the periodic tugs-of-war (and other appendages) between groups of megalomaniacal sociopathic tax-parasites who – to paraphrase the article to make iut more accurate – “highlight [usually chimerical or politicogenic] problems and try to find some way to exploit them to transfer wealth to their cronies”..

Lovely writeup, although sadly lacking sources.
One source I personally can think about is Steven Pinker but if I remember correctly he showcased in one of his books (or was it a ted talk? or both?, someone care to link us up with the source as I can’t remember exactly where I saw this) that global violence has never been so low and has been steadily decreasing throughout the last hundreds of years.

You’re probably thinking of his enormous book, ‘The Better Angels of Our Nature’: http://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0143122010/

Yes, you mention the slight reduction in emissions from the developed world, but you gloss over the rise of the middle class in India and China fueled by coal and oil. They rightly point their fingers at us, complaining that we’ve burned more than our fair share over the past century. And four percent of a reduction is still 96% of emissions released into the climate system. Emissions that will continue to warm our planet for the next century.
The permafrost is thawing at a rapid rate, releasing huge amounts of methane that could push us past some irreversible tipping points. Oceans are acidifying. Glaciers are retreating. I really do hope that the Climate Crisis ultimately becomes the Cold War of my generation, but time is rapidly running out if we want to stabilize the climate system.
This is the battle of our age. The great achievements you listed above will be for naught if we fail to pull together on this.

We can do nothing about climate change except to try and survive it. Yes it is happening and we are certainly contributing to a predetermined direction, but, we are not the motivators of it. The earth weather system will adjust, and will run it’s course and do what it’s going to do regardless of what us puny humans do (this  happens over thousands of years). Please do note though, I fully support our efforts to become environmentally neutral and do away with unnecessary pollution and so on. This fixation on it by the west is simply this, employment creation within the knowledge (and service) industry to help us buffer our ailing manufacturing and industrial industries.
And by the way, global warming is not an apocalyptic event. Many plants and species thrive in warmer weather. Yes there will be mast extinctions of evolutionary specialists, but that has been going on since well… forever and other animals eventually step in to fill the voids.

A generation is growing up that knows little of war? This is a load of bullshit.
In the US any kid born from 2001 on has never known a time without an ongoing war. For any kid in the US born from 1990 on, there have been maybe a few short years where the US wasn’t involved in some conflict or another. For military kids, tell them that there has been little war and conflict. My roommate in college is an Air Force brat, and his parents were both 20+ years in the Air Force. One was deployed to over 10 different conflicts, the other was involved in 7…most of this over the course of the past 20 or so years.
So don’t generalize and say that this generation knows nothing of war, because in the US, it’s what we have grown up with…seeing friends and family members deploy overseas, many times not to come back, or to come back injured or psychologically broken.







Horselover Fat



We are living in the most peaceful time in all of human history. Sorry, but your anecdotes prove nothing – on the whole, most kids growing up today have never experienced the first-hand effects of war.







Christian



Anecdotes prove a lot, think for yourself just for once instead if repeating what youve been told.







Chris Sherlock



Anecdotes are mere that: anecdotes. There are indeed more kids who haven’t experienced first hand the effects if war than there are kids who have experienced war.

Not really “war”, we used to call such small engagements “police actions” or the like. Iraq, after all, was no more costly as a percentage of GDP than the conflict the US had in the Philippines around the turn of the century and not many would think of that as much of a war. 
Yes, the US has engaged in some serious little fights but nothing that engaged all our resources as war is commonly thought to do.






arklington



1968 was the bloodiest year for US troops during the Vietnam War. In that year there were over 16,000 fatalities, many of them conscripts; that’s over 40 a day, and that was less than fifty years ago. Heart-wrenching though it might be to see the loss of combatants today, it is a perfectly valid assertion to make, because there are a generation of people who cannot conceive of what it means to lose so many young people on such a scale in such a short period of time, and for so little.







stupocalypto



quite sweet you are so optimistic, but just because things aren’t as bad as they could be, doesn’t make things good.






ZBzacbrown



Except that “fracking” is a poisonous, non-economically-viable, non-ecologically-viable, destructive, and overly resource consumptive process wherein extremely hazardous chemicals are injected directly into the ground and then are only partially reclaimed (with that which is reclaimed being done so with little or no oversight and regulation, then being stored in under-regulated facilities) which has been shown to not only cause short- and long-term negative health effects on those living nearby, but also to cause dangerous events such as water igniting or even exploding in the homes of those people. http://www.propublica.org/series/fracking







http://www.facebook.com/people/Steve-Walser/100000639217692                Steve Walser



You, and Propublica, are environmental ignoramuses!! 99.9% of what is injected is sand and water and the remaining 0.1% is not “highly toxic” as much of it is sodium chloride (salt)! As for not being “economically viable” how do you explain that companies that perform this function have created millions of high paying jobs and enriched whole states in the US all while operating without government subsidy but by selling their products on the open market? 
You know nothing about what you are talking about but are merely spouting propaganda spread by radical environmental doomsayers who oppose all human resource extraction.







ZBzacbrown



Sorry but I’ve actually done quite a lot of research into the process. Methane is used as well as various other chemicals (which are often not subject to disclosure). Also, the fracking process uses massive amounts of fresh water which is typically drawn from local sources such as lakes and then made toxic (thus depleting the lake or other water source). Also, there is a lot of really heavy equipment that is necessary to complete the process, all of that equipment adds a lot of additional wear to local roads and bridges, not to mention the additional noise pollution. What typically happens is that land is purchased from economically impoverished people or the land is purchased in a sort of hostile takeover of land by the energy company. It really is a dreadful process and I suggest you try reading (I’m guessing that’s hard for you) before you assume you know what you’re talking about.
As for the “millions of high paying jobs” please show me some statistics of how long those jobs last, how many -new- jobs were created (as in, people who were out of work were given a job, not just people who moved from one site to another) and, also, what exactly your definition of “high paying” is versus your understanding of the cost of living in the states (this will require a chart or some such instrument).







mikewaller



My mind remains to be made up on this topic, so Steve,it’s over to you!







Somebody42



As is mine.
It’s a complicated subject.  It can be done safely, but we’re not there yet as a country in policing it.  I get to attend some pretty high level functions side by side with representatives of the EPA, DEP, & OSHA.  The A) don’t have the manpower, B) the knowledge, and C) the funding to make sure things are being done correctly.
Politics make it even scarier.  “What?  It generates $ and jobs for my constituents and they’ll take me out to dinner?  Why bother looking into it?  I’m for drilling ANYTHING.”







Somebody42



I’ve got some problems with the sources of your “research”.  Please read this and keep an open mind.  It’s based on ~7 years of working in the oil & gas industry, mostly doing “Hydraulic Fracture Monitoring” work using seismic data.  AKA… Directly monitoring exactly where this sand, water, and chemicals are going underground.
You mentioned methane.  The areas being frac’d underground contain methane… as well as “various other chemicals”.  So it doesn’t frighten me to pump methane into a methane filled reservoir underground.  It’s been on this Earth longer than we have.  Ok… Yes, some other scary things are being pumped into the ground.  Just keep in mind that they’re being pumped directly into rock formations usually > 1mile underground that contain some very scary things already.  Hydrocarbons are no joke.  There’s also Hydrogen Sulfide and God knows what else.  Is it a perfect scenario, no.  But tell me it’s not better than the world burning  coal and oil until we can make a cleaner energy source more realistic.
Fracing is just being seen as the face of the monster by people who don’t really know what they’re talking about.  The same type of people that assume that reading is hard for people with a different viewpoint.
I believe who you’re trying to go after is anyone actually “drilling”.  I’m not scared of fracing wells, I’m scared of drilling them in the first place.  This is the time we’re coming in contact with our water table.  This is the part where there have been too many mistakes that cause irreversible damage.  Fracing has nothing to do with this.  Short cuts in isolating our ground water while drilling is where we end up with people with flammable wells on their property.  But you’re educated and well researched, I’m telling you nothing new.
And don’t give me the tears about leasing land and ask for proof on the positive effects on jobs and economies.  You want statistics, keep doing your research and go find them for yourself.  Start with Pennsylvania and how they fared during the gas boom & simultaneous global economic crash.  I can give you at least 30 names of local people that have more than doubled their income by entering new jobs related with drilling in the area.  Average incomes around $75k.  That’s pretty good and above average in the area.  And there is an endless supply of people willing to lease their land that are making considerable more than $75k / yr.
You can’t hide behind your computer and argue that “fracing is bad” when it’s much more complicated than you understand.
There are hazards associated with fracing just like every other major source of energy our race has discovered (ignoring wind and solar, which can’t currently sustain us).  Is drilling something I hope we can get away from… yes.  Is it the best option we have available now… yup.  Don’t try to sound informed after watching Gasland.







spyder



If fracking is safer than drilling for oil, then explain to me about what’s going on in Louisiana?   http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2186880/Louisiana-sinkhole-Enormous-400ft-deep-hole-swallows-100ft-tall-trees-raises-concerns-explosions.html






ZBzacbrown



First,  I’ve never seen “Gasland” because most documentaries are inflammatory garbage. Moving on, I don’t think people can’t read because they have different points of view, I think they can’t read because they don’t do it. For instance, I find the fact that you offer anecdotal evidence regarding the monetary situation of landowners to be particularly telling. A few lucky people isn’t a statistically relevant sample. An average income of 75K doesn’t give us any statistical information what so ever. What are the jobs of those people? Geological engineers and scientists? What about the workers being exposed to the chemicals? What about the state employees who have to work extra hard to maintain the roads and bridges that the (very) heavy equipment travels over? The process of fracing is extremely complex and the laws haven’t really caught up yet. Here’s a short article explaining it in brief (http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/shale-play-litigation-study-various-risks). Further, the recovered material has to go somewhere and there are a lot of nasty things that come out in the water. Some more mildly informative information can be found here (https://prospect.org/article/drill-maybe-drill-0). And if you’re not worried about methane, you should be (http://www.catskillcitizens.org/learnmore/ReplytoSabaandOrzechowskiandSchon.pdf). Like I said, I’ve done a lot of research into fracing. Both because there is proposed fracing legislation in my home state and because it’s an extremely interesting topic from an engineering standpoint and from a risk communications standpoint (a lot of my graduate work has been in risk communications – that isn’t about trying to scare people, it’s about helping people make informed decisions). So, while your arguments are seemingly informed, I believe they are misguided (perhaps due to a financial interest in fracing being used, as it was or is a part of your livelihood).









MatBastardson



Hey, it gets even worse. Did you know that the water you drink every day is composed of two well-known components of ROCKET FUEL?! You’re a fear-monger. For all the predictions of you doomsayers, the average lifespan for us humans keeps going up and up and up. We now live far longer than people did when we had never even heard of fossil fuels. Have a cookie and quit yer bitchin’. You’ll feel better. Or at least I will.

fracking is amazing, in the sense that it is amazing that WE Americans are allowing it to happen at all. I think it is the worst thing to come out of the past few years as far as energy resource management.







http://www.facebook.com/KingAdamo                Adam Elijah Vanderlip



Are you kidding?  From a country that gets such a huge percentage of its energy from Coal, the United States would be crazy not to explore fracking as much as humanly possible.  The United States has just posted its lowest CO2 emissions in 20 years (http://news.yahoo.com/ap-impact-co2-emissions-us-drop-20-low-174616030–finance.html) because of fracking and you want to stop?  What are you, a Koch Employee?  The US could easily achieve and even beat the Kyoto protocol limits if they switched entirely to fracking based natural gas.

Wow you championed fracking as something that gives us energy abundance. You are so uninformed that it’s sad.

So much anger in the comments. “But things ARE terrible – REALLY!!!” If you really need citations – as if you’d follow the inks and actually read them – try Google, you lazy sods. But of course, it’s simpler than that. Tens of millions have been lifted out of grinding rural poverty in China. The number of automobiles being sold every day will stand in as a measure of that fact. There are no major wars going on that affect any of us, and what military actions that are going on are local and small scale. Our family and friends are not dying in the streets of infectious diseases. And with fracking breaking the back of the ‘peak energy’ loons, reliable energy for decades is at hand. 
But in spite of it all, the miserable will be miserable. Their disease is incurable.







Smithersjones1



And that makes it ‘the greatest year in the history of the world’?






mikewaller



I remember hearing the Oxford Psychologist, Michael Argyle, say that repeated studies had shown  that depressives usually have a better grip on reality than do non-depressives: For example, the depressives accounts of how they are perceived by significant others are far closer to the perceptions reported by the significant others than those of non-depressives. As, in my view, depression is distinctly mal-adaptive at the level of the individual, it looks like cock-eyed optimism increases individual fitness. Put at its starkest, a cold-eyed appreciation that you are but one of 7 billion plus others, born into a world in which you are obliged to compete relentlessly for scarce resources during a lifetime the purpose of which remains unclear if not self-evidently pointless, does not tend to make you happy and well motivated. 
I also note that elsewhere Pinker has accepted that our sense that “consciousness” is running the whole show, is almost certainly illusory.  It seems to me to follow from this that our basic drives remain those that propelled us out of the primeval swamp, it must, therefore, be external factors to have brought about the global reduction in violence. My money is on atomic weaponry and missile technology as these in combination have the wonderful quality of making would-be global war leaders understand that they are as likely to be casualties as are the poor bloody infantry.







Smithersjones1



but 2012 has been the greatest year in the history of the world
How dismissive of the earth’s history, let alone human history could the author be? It never stops amazing me the self-absorbed arrogance of a certain faction of humanity. Here we are an animal that has only  existed to our knowledge for the last 200,000 years and as far as we know has only had anything more than rudimentary communication skills for at most 5,000 of those years when the planet we exist on is estmated to be £4.5 billion years old and yet some idiot declares that it is this last year, 2012, that is’ the greatest year in the history of the world’. Priceless
Will he next year declare the achievements of humanity to be the greatest achievements in the history of the universe?
Anyway, personally, I’d actually go for the year when life was first created out of the primordial ooze as possibly ‘the greatest year in the history of the world’ but that’s neither here nor there. I realise we are now heading into the festive silly season but I do hope we are not going to have any more of these complacent self congratulatory pieces of ridiculous species back slapping!
PS I note he didn’t mention how much of the natural world the contagion of humanity has destroyed this year? I suppose it didn’t really fit the purile rah-rah cheerleader narrative of this piece now did it?







nitpicker



“rudimentary communication skills for at most 5,000 of those years”
Not true. Humans demonstrated a fairly high level of organization by at least 10,000 years ago when Jericho and Catal Huyuk were inhabited. That level of organization requires more than rudimentary communication. Just because there’s no *written* extant communication doesn’t mean that communication as a whole was poor.

You have to read the headline in the context of the column, and the column’s clearly not directed toward the entire history of the planet, let alone the universe.
What it’s saying is that this is the best time in history to be alive, as a human.  I’m not certain that’s a reasonably debateable proposition. Hunger, poverty, disease, and war are still with us, but far less so (especially the first three) than at any other time in history.






H McCallum



We should thank you for providing such a good example of the vicious misanthropy that powers green “thought” and emotion.  The propagandist organisations (Greenpeace, WWF, FOE, et al.) work hard to conceal it: but it’s there, in all their statements and all their actions.
The rancid nihilism of the greens – and their fervent enthusiasm for infecting children with the same – is (IMHO) the single greatest problem (amongst many) we face as a civilisation.






DingDingDong



Sorry, but in the “silly season” of your response, you mentioned that “the greatest year in the history of the world” was “the year when life was first created…” – but then you go on to refer “…the contagion of humanity…”  So which is it…the greatest year in the history of the world, or a contagion?  
Ants “destroy” the ground…as do worms.  Elk and deer “destroy” trees, ground, vegitation, etc.  Humanity is the SINGULAR category which actually tries to REPAIR damages caused by them.  What a terrible contagion!  You might want to see a doctor about that!
By the way – when you look at humanity as a contagion, that puts you in the same boat as the unibomber, and these kooks that turn into mass-murderers.  You might want to re-evaluate your views just a bit.







CallyK



Some things in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse
When you’re chewing on life’s gristle
Don’t grumble, give a whistle
And this’ll help things turn out for the best
And…
Always look on the bright side of life (whistle)
Always look on the light side of life (whistle)
If life seems jolly rotten
There’s something you’ve forgotten
And that’s to laugh and smile and dance and sing
When you’re feeling in the dumps
Don’t be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle – that’s the thing
And… 
Always look on the bright side of life… (whistle)
Come on!
Always look on the bright side of life… (whistle)
For life is quite absurd
And death’s the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin – give the audience a grin
Enjoy it – it’s your last chance anyhow
So always look on the bright side of death (whistle)
Just before you draw your terminal breath (whistle)
Life’s a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life’s a laugh and death’s a joke, it’s true
You’ll see it’s all a show
Keep ‘em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh is on you
And always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life (whistle)
Always look on the bright side of life (whistle)
Always look on the bright side of life (whistle)

Has national morale ever been as strong as it was during the Jubilee and the Olympics?
Ever heard of Dunkirk evacuation or VE Day? I think the national morale might have surpassed that of this year? Hell the attitude of the nation throughout  the five years (as opposed to a few weeks) of World War II I think might be a candidate that leaves this years outpourings of nationalism standing at the start. I’m sure there have been plenty of other times as well. 1966 would have been another.
In anycase national morale can’t be that good because less than 30% of those living in England and Wales in 2011 considered themselves British and I doubt that many changed their minds as a result of a couple of handfuls of medals and a few parties…….

An yes population, global warming, extinction may be the hand that pulls the plug but specifically talking about this year then the author is correct and next year may be an even better year, as conflicts in middle east, Somalia, Afghanistan decrease, vaccinations programmes continue to eliminate diseases and 3rd world countries continue to grow.

The statement ‘fossil fuel consumption in those countries fell by 4 per cent’ is entirely untrue and extraordinarily irresponsible. As someone with a doctorate in environmental communication and who spent one day this week at the ‘Energy Security in a Multipolar World’ conference at the Royal Society – I can assure you that the claim made in this article about decreasing fossil fuel consumption is false. It was not reported because those who understand the issues involved with energy – you will know it is not true. Who wrote this article and is taking responsibility for these supposed facts? The Spectator has a responsibility to fact check and provide creditable references to these kinds of statement. I will explore options to complain about this misinformation you are peddling if it is not retracted immediately.

Any idiot who actually wants this type of education is worth even less. When your lights go out and your heat goes off we will see how far that doctorate takes you….. I’ll bet you insist on everyone calling you “doctor” as well!!! When you can cure patients, prescribe medicine, and perform surgery THEN I’ll call you a doctor….until then you are nothing more than a wannabe with a worthless piece of paper who demands respect for your education versus actually earning respect for what you have done.

Excellent article.
As others on this thread have said, anyone who questions whether this era is the most peaceful in history ought to read Steven Pinker’s ‘The Better Angels of our Nature: The Decline of Violence’. It is very persuasive. And he backs up all his arguments with empirical evidence, not just conjecture and anecdotes.
It is very easy to view the world through jaded eyes if ones reads the news every day – “violence at record low” is not a popular headline. But the facts suggest that we (the world population, not just the West) are indeed living in a surprisingly peaceful, prosperous and healthy era. Clearly there are problems, and at no point does the Speccie suggest there aren’t, but there is a clear trend towards peace and prosperity.

Russia under Stalin also reached a  peak of prosperity.  That did not mean his system was the best nor that it was sustainable.
You have forgotten the little word “sustainable”, have you not?  Is gross inequality sustainable?
Mull it fior yourself. I am too lazy to spell it out for you.







Fraser Nelson



There has never been less global inequality than now. Proof: http://cid.bcrp.gob.pe/biblio/Papers/NBER/2009/Octubre/w15433.pdf







Raman_Indian123



Fraser Nelson, use some common sense.  Grotesque inequality is becoming the rule even in Western societies today, let alone in places like China and India. Inequality means greater power for the haves.
Besides, its a simple logical fallacy to claim that because things are better than before they are acceptable.  Stalin did more for Russian healthcare than the Tsars. Was he therefore acceptable?  The British used to tell Indians Timur the Lame’s rule was worse than theirs. It cut no ice, though it was true.
Moreover, though no-one doubts historical progress, we still need to ask WHY progress happens.  Because people fight the rich and powerful.






Raman_Indian123



Mr Nelson, yours is the Marie Antoinette philosophy of history. It is dangerously misleading and the guillotine stands at the end of it.  For the rich, life is always pleasant and the rest can just suffer contentedly because it was even worse before. The rest do not see things the same way, hence human progress.

There’s a lot to be said for optimism. It cheers the world up and makes for a better future. Optimism is characteristic of certain professions. Bankers are thrusting, optimistic people, and you’ve never heard of a banker making a dubious decision, have you. The future is bright and rosy and lovely, prosperity piled upon prosperity is our future, and prosperous people are happy people. I see one long undending orgasmic orgy of prosperity.

I don’t see the evidence in statistics at least not in absolute numbers, but we can see a dramatic food price explosion in recent years as the effect of massive overpopulation kick in really bad.

>less disease
I must have missed the news about wiping out aids, etc.
>or more prosperity.
Not sure has this is defined. If you mean that more people made the jump above the ridiculous 1$ poverty line, it’s called inflation!!!
In fact the definitions of prosperity are a bit sketchy, and in this case def. not with a sustainable economy in mind. In an overpopulated world with an unsustainable economy our past generation lived on our cost and we live on cost of our future lives and the lives of future generations to come. Call it robbery.
>And global inequality? This, too, is lower now than any point in modern times. Globalisation means the world’s not just getting richer, but fairer too.
There has probably never been a time in history where wealth was more concentrated than now. 
>Buying cheap plastic toys made in China really is helping to make poverty history.
not really. wealth distribution has little to do with where you produce. i haven’t heard of easing poverty in let’s say Bangladesh thanks to textile manufactures that moves there to escape “expensive” countries like china. The current system is based on exploitation of the working, so the more work the more the worker is exploited.
>The doom-mongers will tell you that we cannot sustain worldwide economic growth without ruining our environment. But while the rich world’s economies grew by 6 per cent over the last seven years, fossil fuel consumption in those countries fell by 4 per cent.
If you outsource stinky production to countries with lower standards don’t you dare to bring that shit up as progress in the west. 
>And what about the concerns that the oil would run out? The amazing breakthroughs in ‘fracking’ technology mean that, in spite of the world’s escalating population — from one billion to seven billion over the last two centuries — we live in an age of energy abundance.
Everything comes at a price and there is a reason why fracking only developed recently, because it destroys the surrounding land and especially the water systems. Also if there were an energy abundance we’d see dropping prices across the board. Clearly that’s not the case, the opposite is true and that’s the reason for the beginning of fracking now.
>Advances in medicine and technology mean that people across the world are living longer. The average life expectancy in Africa reached 55 this year. Ten years ago, it was 50.
oh really? and what was the life expectancy before it was 50? Yes life expectancy was higher in Africa before.
>As developing countries become richer, we can expect the death toll from natural disasters to diminish — and the same UN extrapolations that predict such threatening sea-level rises for Bangladesh also say that, in two or three generations’ time, it will be as rich as Britain.
Well not as rich, but as poor, as all the shitty labor and shitty production will have been transferred to the places with the worst living conditions. so yes there we will see equality not in richness, but equality in poverty.
>War has historically been humanity’s biggest killer.
Nah. Diseases have been number one killer.
>The Peace Research Institute in Oslo says there have been fewer war deaths in the last decade than any time in the last century. Whether we are living through an anomalous period of peace, or whether the risk of nuclear apocalypse has proved an effective deterrent, mankind seems no longer to be its own worst enemy. 
Yes there is less war (symmetry conflict), simply because the US is ruling the planet and you can’t match its power. It bulldozes countries together with its allies like Yugoslavia, like Iraq in no time. Military dominance in the war against Yugoslavia in 1999 was 300 fold!!!! so yeah big progress. there will be less war. but there be more of unsymmetric warfare aka terrorism or if its in the interest of the pax americana “freedom fighting”. 
>Germany was perhaps the most civilised nation in the world in the 1920s.
Now it’s enough with the bs. please. Germany in 1920s was constant class war on the streets till hitler was given power by the corporations.
>Christmas in Britain will not be without its challenges: costs are rising (although many children will give quiet thanks for the 70 per cent increase in the price of Brussels sprouts)
oh i liked Brussels sprouts as a kind. don’t tell me what i like or not.
I guess the autho isn’t really proud of this shit and that’s why (s)he goes incognito.

Billions of people still live on less than a dollar a day. They lack three basic needs for human being food, shelter, and water. Water is most precious gift of life and it is most limited resource we have and making sure plants and animals excluding largest animal group humans have enough to share among themselves is a fantasy.

What world are these people living in.  The past four years in general have been horrible.  Prosperity?  Who?  Where?  Higher unemployment rate, lower wages on average, lower quality of jobs, companies shutting down in the light of four more years of the same (mr. obama).






Heftyeffinfee



Easy there with the fracking. It uses a proprietary cocktail of chemicals that is shot directly into the ground to basically “explode” the natural gas loose. We’re basically injecting toxic materials DIRECTLY into the water table, but you know, Big Oil (increasingly becoming Big Gas) won’t tell you that.







http://pulse.yahoo.com/_KNLNLVF3LXWHCBAINHSCDTCG2M                Ed Thesled



Please do a little research. Your statements are completely incorrect, as has been show in any number a locations where fracking is being used safely and effectively.






Crutch



Exactly WHERE do you think the “water table” resides Einstein? Let’s see, anywhere from a few feet near a water source to a few hundred feet otherwise. On the other hand the fracking you are whining about takes place several thousand feet below the surface in almost every case. Oil companies employ people who actually DRINK water to stay alive so they are careful about it. Meanwhile Liberals like you who create nothing, build nothing, and know nothing, comment on everything…….proving your ignorance daily. Thanks….for nothing!







Jake



True story.






Tony



The fact that the author mentioned fracking in any sort of positive sense tarnished the credibility of this article. Fracking is not “amazing”, it is deadly poisonous and wasteful – if you are looking for new energy sources for now and the future, look elsewhere. All credible research shows that hydraulic fracturing is absolutely horrible for the environment and is completely unsustainable. New York State is currently in a battle against allowing fracking to take place on its soil. The number one argument in favor of fracking is the promise of an economical energy source, however, this is flawed as this argument fails to consider any of the real long-term economic disadvantages fracking would introduce, such as a very near future where the local environment is destroyed/poisoned (which can only lead to hosts of other problems) and fresh drinking water becomes even more scarce. Keep in mind that one of the fears for our future is the lack of fresh drinking water for the growing human population on the planet – a technique such as fracking will only add to this problem. Look for the documentary “Gasland” for some solid insight into this pressing issue.







Libtard



Moron, there is not one single case of fracking damaging ground water.  But then again you source Gasland as your source no wonder you are an unmitigated idiot.






http://pulse.yahoo.com/_KNLNLVF3LXWHCBAINHSCDTCG2M                Ed Thesled



Your ignorance about fracking is astounding.  Your assertions are wrong and citing the movie “Gasland” as authority for your arguments is comical at best.  Gasland is a propaganda piece for the anti-fracking crowd, not an objective documentary.  Perhaps reseaching a broader array of information would lead you to a more balanced (or at least more credible) view. Even the US EPA has said that fracking does not present the dangers that its opponents cite without authority.

“All credible research shows that hydraulic fracturing is absolutely horrible for the environment.”

The article eerily parallels Squealer’s pronouncements for the residents of Animal Farm and the above commenter is woefully behind the curve on fracking technology.
 I wonder how many people on this board concerned with contaminated
water have even heard of Ecosphere, Aquamost,  Water Tectonics, GasFrac or a dozen other start-ups?    For example, Ecosphere’s  ozone process is a chemical free way to treat wastewater.   Ozone used for water treatment is an exempted use in most parts of the world.   I use it myself to treat rotten smelling well water,  high in iron and manganese.  Ozone is 150% more effective than chlorine as
a bactericide .    Ecosphere’s Ozonic process used to treat frac water is a far more efficient, 4 step process that not only removes contaminants, but actually sterilizes the water so that it can be re-used or recycled.  One portable unit can treat over 120 barrels per minute and is scalable.   As a result: Drillers are using up to 90% less water during hydraulic fracturing.
That not only saves water and costs. It eliminates the need to use chemicals to kill bacteria. That means less toxicity.   Transportation involved in disposing  of toxic wastewater is mostly eliminated.   That also saves costs along with less air
pollution from trucks.
The 1.5 million acre Blackfoot Nation in North Central Montana says this works for them.   The Mississippi towns that were supplied with emergency drinking water after hurricane Katrina know that it works. With billions of gallons being successfully treated at over 500 gas and oil rigs, drillers are also saying it works.
We should recognize and encourage these doable solutions instead trying to shut down drilling altogether with over-dramatized and mostly false assertions in out of date hit pieces like ”Gasland”.
Bottom line here is that the world needs energy that is dependable and that is affordable.   Nothing else even comes close to natural gas.   Unless a better process is invented, hydraulic fracturing is the best way to access this resource.   Regulation, should be based on actual critical need, not some scary, low probability scenario.

Eric_Saunders



This article is pretty wack.  The author makes some very questionable assertions as though they are undisputed fact.  For one thing, I don’t think ‘globalization’ is responsible for growth.  None of the countries that have experienced the most growth have adhered to the neoliberal Washington Consensus.  In fact, it is the breakdown of American dominance of the international political economy that probably deserves a good share of the credit for the growth.  If it were up to the US, a lot more countries would be like Congo where our Rwanda and Uganda proxies have been committing genocide for many years.  The chaos is good for Western multinationals, however.  Lots of cheap Coltan and Cobalt for our smart phones.
And it is hard to be excited about fraking.  It is very bad for the environment and thanks to captured public officials, the profits will accrue to private corporations.  In all, the situation in the Western world is pretty grim as neoliberalism is turning into neofeudal debt peons with declining prospects for the future.

“The author makes some very questionable assertions as though they are undisputed fact.”
“…fraking.  It is very bad for the environment…”
Hmm, pot calling the kettle black.







Eric_Saunders



The groundwater pollution caused by fracking is well documented.  This is not the only environmental concern associated with the practice.







fewiz



My point is that you state all that as undisputed fact, when the truth is that it is disputed.  You’re as bad as the person you criticize.
Yes, there are environmental “concerns,”  and yes, there is one instance that I know of where fracking fluid has been found in an aquifer, but the jury is still out on whether any of this is a significant threat.  No, not the jury composed of eco zealots, the one composed of our peers – the normal, open-minded citizens that decide such things in a court of law.
Even the eco-nazis in charge of the EPA have not issued their final determination.  Yet, you make statements of fact.
But, I’m sure you won’t understand any of this.  Zealots rarely see what open-minded people do.







Eric_Saunders



You use the term ‘eco-nazis’ to describe the toothless, corporate captured EPA.  Then you seemingly characterize me as the ‘Zealot’ and ‘yourself’ as open-minded.  This is internet troll self-parody at its finest.

This article seems to be a lot of puffery for sure.
I see that you have addressed fracking, which is a good thing.
However, the economic conditions around the world are dire.  The G8 countries are all in debt, with The US, UK, and EU countries leading the way.  The US is currently led by a Marxist president (re-elected by a strong majority of idiots) engaging in economic suicide, the UK is led by a faux-conservative in the tradition of Brian Mulrooney (as evidenced by the rise of UKIP in the local elections), and the EU is Hell-bent on federalism, and countries like Greece and Italy have had techonocrats installed against the will of the people.
I fail to see why the author did not address this.  
The loss of freedom and economic prosperity is on the rise on the planet.  When people are looking to the Communist Chinese for an economic model that works (the kicker is that they will experience a stunningly sharp crash in the near future), there is a big problem.  When the media in this country are more concerned with false racism, than the fact that their beloved Marxist leader is inept and destructive to not only our nation, but the world’s economy at large, there is huge problem.

All you have to do is take all the money from those who earned it, give it to the governments, so that it can be taken from them and distributed to countries that DIDN’T earn it…and those poor folks in those poor countries will suddenly be better off than they had been….and who cares about the bourgeois/rich because we all hate/envy them so much anyway, right?
What you are celebrating, Spectator, is global communism.  Everyone will be EQUALLY poor and miserable.  Sounds great, right?!  So lets just continue to celebrate the global chopping of knees from the successful nations so that the little nations will seem smaller…because if communism teaches us one thing – it isn’t about bringing the little guys up to the higher level, it’s about destroying the bigger guys, and taking them towards the lower level…forcing everyone into the same stagnant mediocrity.  Where are the party poppers and bangers when you need them, this is a celebration, right Spectator?  Woohoo, mediocrity!

Or, the empire lies in crumbling ruin while its people grow weak and stupid, there’s no food, and the enemy is literally knocking at our gates but at least we’re all equally screwed in this together, and some will even benefit directly from our demise so it evens out as a good thing.

What kind of drug is this writer taking?  I want to get some of that so I can forget that 2012 was the year that an unqualified racist idiologue was re-elected by ignorant voters (with the help of massive voter fraud) to achieve his goal of destroying our nation to appease his anti-colonialist beliefs.  Maybe I’d be able to forget that our ambassador in Libya and three brave military men died because to help them would endanger Obama’s campaign, and that hundreds more people are dead because of the illegal and inept gun-running operation carried out under Obama’s command.  I would hope some of that drug would keep me from thinking about the unimaginably huge and growing debt this gang of thieves has thrust on all of us and all future generations.  Maybe I wouldn’t notice that the country has never been this divided since 1860, and I could quit worrying that it may take another civil war to get it all sorted out.  Man, I could get hooked on a drug like that!

Human population is exploding.  The Earth can only deal with the pollution from X amount of humans for Y amount of time, and we’re already at 2X.  Google: red tides, ocean dead zones, and mass fish kills to monitor the End, perhaps 30 years?  Most people are so self centered and schizoidprenic that they probably don’t realize that they’re destroying the oceans, or that our oceans make most of our oxygen.  Our society is getting so corrupt and dysfunctional that half of our society doesnt’ work… and thinks that making slaves of the people who do work is OK as long as it’s kept under wraps.Worst yet, the people who are aware of what’s going on don’t have the cojones to get organized, while those that are destroying our businesses are very well organized. I’m stocking up… have solar panels, wells, greenhouse, etc.   I see a mass extinction coming.  Certainly a nuke war is coming…  without war throughout the ages we’d already be extinct.

Canadians didn’t even want to bother in helping the US provide a missile defense for Northern America.  Why was that?  You knew that we would do it.

Great article! Clearly things keep getting better over the centuries – with some ups and downs along the way. Most of this progress is owing to the continued accumulation of knowledge and capital, in spite of parasitical governments’ attempts to hamper peacefully, freely acting people.
The naysayers have a lack of perspective and poor understanding of history and economics. Or they are thinking emotionally: look how many are whining about Obama. Yes, the USSA will undergo a hyperinflationary currency collapse sooner or later. But it has done so in the past. It’s just another blip in the big picture.

What the article is trying to imply is that the West is struggling economically but all the money we have “lost” has gone to developing countries because we are “sharing” the wealth. The only problem is the debt is so overwhelming around the world that it will hit the fan at some point in the near future, unless drastic economic measures are taken. Are these developing countries going to be economic generators or dependent on the West down the road?

Did you see the news today? Just one story. Foreign holdings of U.S. debt up just 5.5 trillion! That’s up 78% under just Obama. No big deal because we’ve had the best year ever in 2012! I think you can safely say that when America, Europe, Japan are struggling that the world’s economy is not doing well.







Mr. Rational



That’s funny…..its not up 78% under Obama, but whatever…. I saw the same link….you click on the headline and it doesn’t have that number anywhere in the article…..So, did you realize that the US owns most of its own debt in the way of buying bonds?

Well then,  2012 was a good year for her and the rest that “supposedly” got something from  big “O”.

A decade ago that would be called buying votes, now it is the way the DNC operates to win elections)

This “story” is agitprop and propaganda of the first order. The folks at the Spectator aren’t spectating…they’re hallucinating.
The year 2012 will be looked upon by whatever historians are left in the future as the hinge point where the United States went stark raving mad and committed political and economic suicide. That that happens might be an applause line for our foes in the rest of the world, but for freedom-loving Americans it’s not so good. And let’s face it, what’s bad for the US is pretty bad for the remainder of the third rock’s inhabitants.

I get healthcare through the wife’s employer because agency deductibles are at $3500.00 from the contract agency.  At that point you are self insured unless catastrophic!  That is what the government should mandate, affordable deductibles, Get lower price pharmaceuticals,  and quit giving free healthcare to illegals.

Only if you are a welfare recipient, crack head, Illegal Immigrant, or dead beat… In other words a Democrat was 2012 seemingly a good year for you because stupidly you allowed yourself to be hoodwinked into believing the hype even though 2012 was the worst year for poor and under privileged. When your on a down hill slide into economic oblivion even the day before seems like it was the best day ever.

2012 the “best year ever”?  Perhaps you have little life experience or knowledge of history.  Perhaps in the third world, where any imporovement is a quantum or geometric improvement because the baseline is so low… 2012 was an improvement.
However, for most of the modern industrial world, 2012 was a drag… and most  people’s lives were not improved and in fact in the USA, net worth declined by $ 100,000 per family.






Twoiron



I don’t know so much about conditions in the UK, but in America it was the “best year ever” for…
1) Americans who hate America
2) Enemies of America and Israel
3) Marxist/socialists
4) Barack Obama’s vacation planners
5) Those who think the USA should be an even bigger nanny state
6) Race baiters and class warfare proponents
7) Abortionists
8) Illegal aliens
9) Potheads
10) Gay soldiers
11) EPA regulators
12) Uninformed Obama voters, especially those who want “free stuff”







Guest



You don’t know much about anything, let alone the UK.  Your post is the moaning of a born loser crying because he got his rear handed to him on November 6th.  Here’s the truth you don’t want to hear- no one is going to vote for fascist rabble who’ve decided the best way back to power is to insult the American people, all the while taking no responsibility for the disaster they inflicted upon America prior to 2009.  Probably better for you to just throw in your crying towel and push for secession along with your fellow losers.  Where do you live, anyway, Mayberry?







Twoiron



FYI, UK is not the University of Kalcutta. Speaking of not knowing anything and about being a loser. You are a nitwit that professes to have anti-abortion “moral beliefs,” but you voted TWICE for the Abortionist-in-Chief. Most Libs are stuck on stupid…you are mired in moronic. L-L-L-L-L-L-L-O-S-E-R! HAHAHAHAHA!







stingray68



I can always tell you’ve lost the argument when you use caps and exclamation points; your obsessive rants mean nothing to anyone not on psychotropic meds.  BTW, have you been fingering your firearms since Friday’s shooting, wishing you had the determination to pay a visit to your local elementary school?  I’m not joking.







Twoiron



No Starbucks, no elementary schools. I can’t stand Starbucks coffee and I can’t stand the Lib propaganda you hear at the elementary schools.    
Isn’t tomorrow your volunteer day at your local Planned Parenthood clinic? You’re the guy who carries out the plastic bags full of dead babies to the dumpster. Still can’t understand how abortion is against your moral beliefs, unless…you have the morals of toadstool. I’m not joking.    
Here you go: u r a m-o-r-o-n — all lower case, just for you. I haven’t lost an argument to you yet, so why would I start now?

So you do hate elementary schools- frightening.  You have all the hallmarks of a psychopath.  Seriously, you need to be locked up to protect the public, especially children, born and unborn.

“Yeah, SCREW GAY SOLDIERS!” says the 140 year old man in the corner.  Have a warm glass of milk and get to bed.  Also, I think it’s funny how no one heard the “free stuff” argument until after the election.  Has “Sour Grapes” written all over it.
Can you enlighten me to the freedoms you have had taken away?  Because I can still do everything I ever wanted (more really) than I could in the 80′s, except for not having out my my phone calls listened to.  Dammit OBAMA!  Oh wait, that was Bush wasn’t it?  Where am I?

All right.  Here’s one.  Before Obama, I had the RIGHT not to be FORCED to buy an insurance policy.  Now the government forces me to engage in commerce.  As an attorney, I can tell you that we normally don’t allow contracts of adhesion like this because they are UNCONSCIONABLE.  But then again, I’m obviously not as enlightened as you, Obama, and the other Leftists that want to rule my life.







Tynamite



Actually, you still don’t have to buy insurance, you are just taxed at a higher rate if you don’t, no?  Listen, we a already had universal healthcare, we were just going about it in the stupidest possible way.  If you want it the old way, we need to be willing to let uninsured people die at hospital steps.  But we weren’t doing that, and you were paying for the uninsured already.  A contract of adhesion is unconscionable?  Might want to finish up your MCLE for the year, because every private insurance company, or phone company, or internet provider offers only a contract of adhesion.  Nice try flexing your lawyer muscles though.  USC 99′.

Look up who the 10 most educated states voted for and who the 10 least educated states voted for.  Or better yet, which way politically our most economically successful states lean.  Or how about you look up the 20 most popular places in America to visit… places the world wants to see, soak in, and enrich themselves with, and see which was they lean.  On the other hand you could go to Mississippi and find where your hands off government gets you.  Teen pregnancies, poverty, and mooching off the blue states for aid.
I rest my case… bigot.







Twoiron



Look at how the Lib-run states are doing: Kalifornia — broke. NY — broke. IL — broke. How about the Lib-run cities — NYC, busted. Detroit, busted. Cleaveland, busted. Newark, busted. LA, busted, Chicago, busted. I wouldn’t spend 5 cents to travel to any of those. Lots of “smart Libs” (oxymoron) in those places, right? If they’re so damn smart,,, Most educated only means most indoctrinated. A PhD with a credit score of 500 is no asset.     
PS: Adam Lanza has been called a “near-genius.” Good luck with that. 






Guest



Most Red States are flat-broke, too.  Go to any small town in rural America- they’re hanging on by a shoestring.  Same with the Red State you live in.  It’s just more convenient for the right to blame non-whites in urban areas for America’s problems, the same meme they’ve been following for 50 years.  As for ignorance, your earlier predictions of a Romney landslide put you in a clear field for being one of the most ignorant poster on DISQUS.






Twoiron



You don’t know what state I live in, but like most topics, not knowing any facts about a subject doesn’t stop you from pontificating about it. Moron.






Guest



Don’t be coy.  You claimed you moved to a Red State to get away from hated California.  Probably Texas but too much of a coward to say so.  As for pontificating about topics you don’t know about, that fits you to a tee- for someone of your advanced age you should be more worldly than you appear to be.  That’s what happens when you turn into a religious zombie.






Twoiron



Probably not Texas. That leaves you only 56 Oblunder states to guess. I have time if you are that curious. Besides, if I lived next door to NM in TX, I would have paid you a visit by now, neighbor. I am one of the 2.5Bn followers of Jesus Christ and that makes me a zombie? That sounds like your daddy, Satan, talking through you again. Evil, clueless moron.






Guest



Pay me a visit?  What’s stopping you?  Surely for someone who is independently wealthy like you, travel expenses are no object, especially from the Bible Belt.  But why couch your threats in cowardly innuendo- speak what’s really on your mind.  BTW, the jailhouse jump suits here are orange- I hope that’s in your color palette.  Are you an “autumn?”  But the funniest thing about your post is that you make veiled death threats while pretending to be a Christian; more proof, if any were needed, of the nature of your actual theology- satanism.






Twoiron



When does NM’s annual Gaia festival start?     
Go back and re-read what I posted, moron. Are you saying that calling you “neighbor” is a threat??? If so, that’s yet another obvious clue as to your genetic linkage to the Evil One. My lands, you are the king of fools and a Lib moron to boot.






stingray68



Gaia festival?  You’re the one into twinkies, you tell me.






Twoiron



It is a good thing for you they have deinstitutionalized the insane. Otherwise, your only Christmas gift would be a double dose of thorazine from Nurse Ratchet.

What does one of Satan’s own sons get for Christmas? Does your daddy, Beezelbub, give you a fresh batch of lies? Photos of all the dead babies from the abortions you voted for? Crystal meth to pass out to teenagers on the school playground? A selection from the Evil of the Month gift catalog?   






Guest



What’s the matter, Twoiron?  Are you being bullied by your coven?  Is your black robe too short?  Were you in charge of bringing the blood of the innocent for the last black mass but forgot and brought Kool-Aid instead?  Guess it’s not easy for you, being a CoS minion and all- lots of secret rules and ceremonies to remember.  Bet you’re just as unsuccessful there as you are on DISQUS.  Better bring your game to their next midnight orgy of evil or you’ll find yourself being served at the holiday buffet next to the sodomized goat.






Twoiron



Like I said, it’s a good thing for you they have deinstitutionalized the criminally insane. Otherwise, your only Christmas gift would be a double dose of thorazine from Nurse Ratchet.

What does a hate-filled CoS minion like you do on Christmas, anyway?  Your fellow satanists consider you a failure and a fraud, just like the rest of us here in the real world, so how do you spend the holiday?  My guess is you simply seethe by yourself in your basement, planning a mass shooting at your neighborhood elementary school.






Tynamite



Not sure what you mean by “busted” but I’m from NYC and live in LA and I assure you neither are “busted.”  Additionally, your points about you not wanting to visit mean nothing, tourist date tells a different story.  As far as being broke, while Cali and NY are in debt, so are plenty of Red states.  Perhaps you should look at which states GIVE the most to DC and which states GET the most from DC.  The blue states are more or less funding a lot of the red states.  There are of course exception (Texas for one, 94 cents for every dollar).  Illinois gets 75 cents back for every dollar they give, New York 79 cents, Cali 78 cents, though that data may be a few years old, the trends remain the same.  “Indoctrinated?”  You’re starting to sound pretty far out there.  I have an “excellent” credit score and am proud to have gone to college and experience the mesh of minds and cultures you encounter there.  No idea about where you are in your life, but would you not want your child to go to college?






Twoiron



States don’t “give” to DC, citizens and businesses have their own wealth plundered and then wasted by an out-of-control federal gov’t that has become bloated, mismanaged, corrupt and wasteful, in spite of its Constitutionally-granted limits on its powers and authority.

Stalin or Moa were able to accomplish in their efforts to convince society
communism is an acceptable alternative to liberty. 
The advancement of mankind is slowly grinding to a slow
crawl. The philosophy of achievement disregarded to the junk pile of socialist ideology—where tomorrow, when the wealth of those who do produce is spent; the same result of
Russia after their glorious insanity of the Soviet—and we are doing well? 
Perhaps it would be a good policy of drug testing before such journalist tripe is accepted by one thinking he has journalistic credibility.

That’s interesting since we could say that 2012 was one of the worst years in America’s history.  Maybe it’s all the money we give out to thrid world countries, and dictatorships all over the globe that has made the ‘world’ ‘better’ and us worse off than ever before.

UN is the source of information on prosperity? How about rise of global viruses, contamination of our food supply, runaway governments taxing away any incentives, unprecedented unrest in the middle east and elsewhere. It HAS been a great year, indeed, at least for those who want the utter destruction of western civilization (which by the way is/was a very visible benefactor of the third world)







Wyrdless



Global Viruses>  Small pox, rubella, scarlet fever, mumps, polio yellow fever, etc… all now preventable by science.  There are less viruses not more
Food>  There is more food now, not less, and organic food, the only kind in existence until recently, costs less in terms of hours worked to procure than ever before.
Taxes>  The King used to be able to show up at a serfs house and take the daughters if he wanted.  Also, the taxman didn’t need a warrant to enter your house and search for taxable goods.  
Unrest in middle East> Umm, when has there not been unrest in the middle East?  The ottoman empire?  Unrest is normal, because oppressive governments are the norm for most human cultures







DrBobNM



the viruses are mutating to beat the vaccines. Genetically modified foods have been linked to cancer from european studies, a california initiative was struck down requiring food producers to indicate whether it was GMO or not. If it was so harmless why did the food lobby work to defeat it? Middle East, the US helped establish sharia in at least two countries, and a sharia dictator in Egypt. Taxes, we are not talking about the middle ages, if it came to that, that is why we went to war with England. Enjoy your delusions while the world (Rome) burns.

Wyrdless – 
Global Viruses – In the US, we are seeing these diseases popping up again due to illegal immigrants who are not vaccinated. CA has even had bubonic plague show up in small pockets. I guess you weren’t aware of that.
Taxes – The US king doesn’t show up at your house, he sends the IRS. Same thing, and they DO take everything you own. Shoot, the city takes peoples property all of the time and so does the govt…it’s called eminent domain.
Food – Is full of GMO and pesticides. As for organics? That’s a joke. Pay the state $500 and they will give you a certificate saying you are organic so you can charge twice as much for the same food.
Unrest in the Middle East – Is up against the US because WH and minions have filled cabinet positions and other positions with muslims who hate the US. That is not speculation but truth. Look it up.

I found both the article and the comments posted here very interesting.  Poiverty, hunger and aids have definitely been on the decline.  However, there really is no accurate report of the part the American citizens have played.  How do you disregard what President Bush did for Aids in Africa?  How do you disregard what Franklin Graham and his foundations have done world wide, providing medical and educational assistance?  How do you disregard the billions of dollars donated by the American citizenry to foreign causes to improve the lives of their citizens?  Americans are not the only citizens doing this by any means but it has been proven that Americans are the most generous on the face of this earth!  We are the first on the site of disasters in foreign countries and our citizens, rich and poor, send more financial aid than that of any other country!  I am not attempting to take away from anything any other nation does.  I simply want to say that “I am proud to be an American”  and I make no apology for it!

The title of this article, and the article itself, are nothing but a classic textbook example of semantic deception.  I.e., using popular and otherwise plain language to describe a thing or condition in terms that would seem to convey one idea when the complete opposite is true.  This is a technique that has been used by the cultural Marxists for decades to propagandize free people into believing their lies about supposed equality and utopianism when the exact opposite is true.  A somewhat crude example would be the street-wise philosopher saying, “Someone is pissing on your shoes and they’re telling you that it’s raining.”
Never in the history of mankind has their been more famine and disease, more poverty and suffering, more hate and deceit, more graft and corruption, more misery and pain.  Never has the world been in worse shape – and yet hundreds of millions will believe everything said in this article.
The authoritarians and Marxist-Leninists and their pervasive propaganda are winning.  Don’t believe a word they say.

“Never has there been less hunger, less disease or more prosperity.”  I must live in a parallel universe: in my world, never has there been more hunger, more disease, and less prosperity.  The middle class is becoming poorer, while the super rich accumulate more wealth, and the amount of people living in poverty continues to increase.  Disease is rampant, especially those diseases caused by our toxic environment, poor food quality, contaminated water and air, and doctor caused diseases is increasing drastically because of all the drugs and vaccines foisted on a brainwashed population.  The national debt continues to increase, and is almost 20 TRILLION dollars now.  The environment is being destroyed at increasing rates, and even the oceans are dying.  War is not humanity’s biggest killer – allopathic fascism is.  Doctors have caused far more suffering and death than all the wars put together!

- The United States and several other countries have had their credit downgraded multiple times for the first time since their establishment.
- The US is spearheading simultaneous armed conflicts in no less than 5 countries. 
- Unemployment, inflation, and the devaluation of both the USD and the Euro are at a critical apex.
- Freedoms and Liberties are being stripped away from all peoples across the globe, but especially here in the homeland.
- Iconic companies that have been producing jobs and goods since before we were born are closing their doors.
- Drugs are running rampant, the government is illegally running guns across the border in hopes of creating a pretext to strip away even more rights of the people.
- Violent crimes in the UK are higher than even the US, and the UK doesn’t even allow guns.
I could go on for pages. Suffice to say that this is the most outlandish propaganda piece that I’ve ever read.







Tynamite



Yet all of the statistics they listed seem backed up by solid references.  I keep saying this, but if you see a gun policy debate as hurting your freedom, and a bigger negative than less starvation in Africa, your priorities are out of order.
Can you name some freedoms you have personally lost recently?  Because I can name quite a few that have been gained.

Chicago is more than halfway towards their goal of having 10,000 video cameras linked to a central police facility for monitoring the populace.  Are Chicagoans freer because of that?







Tynamite



Did the central government do that or was it done at a local level?  I suspect you are a proponent for more power to states?  On the other hand, gay’s can serve in the military openly, and in many place (probably every blue state in the next 15 years) be able to get married and not have to live like second class citizens.  I would say that is more freedom.







Benjamin Ghazi



100% of Chicagoans – and 100% of the people who visit the city – are affected by being observed by some of the 10,000 cameras that have been / will be installed by 2014.  
Fewer than 5% of Chicagoans are directly affected by gay marriage.
It’s obvious that you have your own priorities.

Prosperity?  Might be true for some, but not all.  As a result of a divorce, current economic conditions, being a former stay-at-home mom and currently an employee who works full time on a comission only basis, I am struggling just to keep a roof over my head.  I see the struggles the economy has placed on my customers daily basis.  My income in years prior to this was less than $30,000,  this year its less than $20,000.   I continue to look for another job and know that with perseverance I will find something that will better my life.  I can say that poverty isn’t fun.  The sacrifies I make just to survive, most people wouldn’t understand.  There is a frustration that exists and a futility that is a constant struggle to overcome.  I know that I will resolve this and am confidant that it will improve.  So, maybe that’s enough to be properous…to just improve life to the point of not being scared all the time.

In Ohio, fracking is poisoning wells and possibly causing earthquakes.







DrDean



Prove it. Just because natural gas appears in a well does not mean that fracking is at fault – and in the vast majority of the cases it is not. 
 I owned an environmental remediation company for 20 years. Natural gas appears quite naturally in aquifiers (and so wells) naturally more often than people think. Show us exactly what methodology was used to determine the gas entered the aquifer due to fracking and not due to natural processes.







slamradio



show us exactly what methodology was used to determine the gas entered the aquifer due to natural process and not due to fracking.  the wells were fine before fracking came to town…







DrDean



What town? What wells? Why not be specific? Fracking leaves a chemical footprint that can be traced. So does natural gas. It is relatively easy to determine the source of any contamination. Bear in mind too that aquifers change and water tables change as well as a result of natural forces.






Benjamin Ghazi



Obama benefitted from fracking in Ohio.  The state saw a decline in unemployment down to 7.2% in September, largely due to natural gas production from fracking.   So go talk to your hero about fracking.

It would be amazing if a country as large and wealthy as the US did not have the finest healthcare facilities imaginable. It is therefore entirely predictable that the wealthy from elsewhere will travel there for treatment. However, the thing that continues to amaze all but the most self-obsessed Europeans and Canadians is America’s seeming content at making wealth the criterion for access. We have no intention of giving the poor Rolls-Royces, but to let someone died or suffer a seriously impaired life for want of money strikes us as reprehensible.

1 Thessalonians 5:3 (New Living Translation) – When people are saying, “Everything is peaceful and secure,” then
disaster will fall on them as suddenly as a pregnant woman’s labor pains
 begin. And there will be no escape.
To think that war has been reduced is folly.  The same people writing this garbage opposed the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which are most likely part of the reason death by war has been so low this decade.  The concept that the world’s most powerful military machine might come knocking on your door has a chilling effect on troublemakers.  But rest assured, four more years of “We’re sorry, we won’t do it again” from Obama will totally reverse the effect and you can see the results of your Pollyanna view of the world.
I almost puked when I read how happy the author(s) of this piece were that Western economies were failing and reducing their carbon emissions.  When the Western world is no longer consuming the products that the Eastern world is getting rich selling to them, how do you think the Eastern world is going to continue to grow?  We are at that tipping point now, and you will soon see the results of a WORLDWIDE depression.  All of that “progress” will revert, and those who lose the most will strike out the most and try to take what they think is rightfully theirs.  War, poverty, and disease will follow.
So yeah, enjoy your statistical victories for now, because they will not last.  This “emergence” of wealth in the non-developed countries has not been through the creation of wealth, but by redistribution.  Look no further than the USSR and Eastern Europe to see how that turns out.

People cannot raise crops to feed the population due to the dought and the fear of being killed. Someone is probably paying you to distribute what yo have written.

Yes, I would think that if you are a hedonist,you’ve had it good in this brash, bawdy society.  Born and raised in this country, a Christian, I feel like that pilgrim in a strange land.  I feel hemned-in by a growing authoritarian, athiestic central government. So many rules, regulations, survailance.  I cannot fly because I will not subject myself to a “legalized” (only because police officials, for some reason, permit the feds) sexual assault.  The Banksters payoff our congress to obtain our treasure because somehow, the bankers are entitled tp million dollar bonuses.  The feds can run a fast and furious gun scheme designed to cast aspersions on the second amendment which results in many people killed, but no one goes to jail.  Former high govt official Corsini as CEO pf an investment giant steals a billion dollars out of private accounts and doesn’t go to jail.  No, I must be a pilgrim in a strange country, because in this country, the crooks are in charge!

I hope he wasn’t referring to America. Hunger,homelessness and government dependency has reached the highest point in the past 4 years under Obama since the great depression.

Let’s be generous and assume this article is correct. How well do they think things will be once the Western Economies finally collapse? Take a step back even from that: what will happen when inflation picks up in the West, as it will, because of the printing of vast sums of unneeded money? What will happen to these Third World economies once Western currencies have been debased to parity or worse with them?
That’s not even counting the likelihood of another major war, etc.

I guess if you are a liberal progessive taker, then it has been the best year ever. If you happen to be in the group pulling the wagon, its been a pretty crappy year.

The only prosperity has been for JPM-C and Goldman-Sachs, even as they hold many times over the worlds GDP in derivatives.  As the federal Reserve debases the U.S. currency it hurts the other nations in the world that hold the dollar, that is the real cause of the Arab-Spring.  Those that live closest to the edge get pushed over it as commodity prices rise even just a small amount for us.  Sure the i-pad is cheaper…, just try to eat one, or sell it for anything close to what you paid.  Fools.







Benjamin Ghazi



” they hold many times over the worlds GDP in derivatives.”
You misrepresent the value of derivatives by over-counting them.
Suppose two people agree to flip a quarter and the winner gets to keep that $0.25.
Then a couple of other people come by and agree to bet on the results the coin toss…and then a few more come by as well.  Then to hedge their bets, some people who bet heads also bet tails.
You are adding all the bets and saying that’s the total.  However, if Tim and Mary bet $10 against each other, that’s only $10, not $20 – which is what your tally says.  
Now imagine that Tim and Mary also bet $2 each on the opposite side (hedging), then their exposure is only $8 – but in your math, it would be $10 plus $10 plus $2 plus $2 – or a total of $24, or three times the amount of the real bet.







Tynamite



I keep reading people saying how this is fluff, and maybe it is, but back up your counter arguments with references.  Every other post I read says the author cherry-picked statistics, says they are wrong, and then provides nothing to back up their own claim.  Yes, the western economy is suffering a bit, but aids rates, and starvation going down seems like good news, no?  And of much great importance considering we’re comparing starving children to some American’s light Christmas bonus.

Although there are thousands of reasons that 2012 was the worst year in memory, let’s go with just a scant few of them:
1. The 2012 US Presidential election was a contest between a communist and a capitalist; a total fraud and a successful businessman; entitlement and prosperity; big government and self-government; arguably the biggest liar of our generation and the one capable executive with the confidence to talk about America’s real problems, and on November 6 we chose the liar.
2.  Despite all efforts, ObamaCare will now go forward in the new year and there is basically no way to block or reverse it until 2017.
3.  The sole accomplishment of the past year, the “fiscal cliff” scenario, which was created to compel the biggest spender of all time to become a spending cutter, has become a trillion-dollar game of chicken and just about every conservative on the radar screen is clucking,

Now go check our national debt and get some perspective about this so called “greatest year ever”.  And that is with giving the fools making this claim the benefit of the doubt.  They are probably still calling the return of the islamic caliphate rising in the middle east the “pro democracy arab spring”.

that, in two or three generations’ time, it will be as rich as Britain.”
But we (America) DON’T have the money to cope. It all is getting paid for on credit. Our future generations are doomed to be saddled with our extravagance, and when the bill collector appears at the door, there won’t be money to pay (but would you take New Jersey and the Brooklyn Bridge?…)

Continuing reasons that 2012 has been the worst year in memory:
4. Other countries (France, for example) are copying the Obama model of “state capitalism,” calling it “modern” and “beneficial.” But state capitalism doesn’t work and has never worked.
5. It’s been a long year, and has even one Secret Service agent or employee been fired because of the prostitution scandal in Colombia?  Has one person been fired for bungling Benghazi?  Has one person been held to account for the crazy graft and corruption in this administration?  Anyone…?
6. Are North Korea, Iran, and Syria less dangerous or more dangerous today than January 1st?  How about Iraq?  Has Iraq been wobbling back to Islamofascism?  Is that why the “unnecessary” war is now renewing with 3,000 American troops?

This article and the “double issue of The Spectator, the best-written and most entertaining magazine in the English language” made me think this was a satire and an attempt at self-deprecating  humor. 
Sadly, with no author listed, we have to assume the entire “editorial” board is deranged, delusional, lacking judgement and intellectually destitute. 
Last but not least, try to tell this to the parents of 20 slayed angels in Newtown, CT and the families of 6 devoted adults working for the school.
This heartbreaking, chilling tragedy would not have happen if Mrs. Lanza exhibited appropriate judgement and not trained her mentally ill son how to handle guns, how to shoot them and if she kept her firearm arsenal out of his reach.
Yes, it’s largely shooter’s mother’s fault. Lack of judgement.

Completely disagree with this article. Obviously, the US, Greece, Britain, Ireland, Spain, Italy, France and several other Eastern European countries economies are almost totally fractured at this point and have been since at least 2008. Then there is Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Uganda, Morocco, Pakistan and Afghanistan that are either in the middle of a war/revolution, or just out of one. Then there are the stagnation countries like Japan (not including their nuclear devastation), South Korea, Indonesia, India, Mexico, Argentina and yes China whose economies are back tracking or their governments are actively fighting against inflation or an increasingly stagnant domestic economy. Then there are Iran, North Korea and Venezuela that have virtually been excommunicated from the rest of the worlds economy.
So yes, for the rest of the world excluding these countries, things may be looking up a little.
Australia, Canada, Brazil, South Africa (not sure about this one) … possibly New Zealand and Chile (also not sure) but they’re not a reflection on the rest of the world.
But if you realistically think that the remaining countries success rests independently of any of these other countries you’re sadly mistaken. Never before has there been a more indebted world, or one that is teetering so close to yet another world war.
That (2012) is not something to be optimistic about at all.

America just had another record year of people going on food stamps. We continue to have people dropping out of looking for employment which artificially lowers the unemployment rate. Our national debt hit $16 trillion this year, and China has the most of it in foreign holdings. In 2012 there will be more households than ever in poverty. 
Yet these knuckle heads want to tell us it’s the best year EVER? How delusional can these idiots get???????? What are they, Obama voters with their heads up their azzes??

TYNAMITE asked: Can you enlighten me to the freedoms you have had taken away?  Because I
 can still do everything I ever wanted (more really) than I could in the
 80′s, except for not having out my my phone calls listened to.  Dammit
OBAMA!  Oh wait, that was Bush wasn’t it?  Where am I?
_______________________________________________________
All right.  Here’s one.  Before Obama, I had the RIGHT not to be FORCED
to buy an insurance policy.  Now the government forces me to engage in
commerce.  As an attorney, I can tell you that we normally don’t allow
contracts of adhesion like this because they are UNCONSCIONABLE.  But
then again, I’m obviously not as enlightened as you, Obama, and the
other Leftists that want to rule my life.  ALSO, those WIRE TAPS you so hate, Obama HAS EXPANDED THEM TO EVERY AMERICAN whereas Bush was using them on SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  Thanks for being a dolt, Tynamite.

Efficiency in a global capitalist system doesn’t lead to more savings but more consumption. That’s because underutilized resources need to be used to obtain more profits. With that, demand destruction in rich countries is taking place not because of efficiency but because of unemployment coupled with high food and oil prices.
The same high oil and food prices has led to what is essentially non-recovery, a recession that has continued for four years, with problems now spreading to other countries, including developing ones which are experiencing economic “growth” only because investors fearful of economic problems in developed nations are moving to them, thus creating the same conditions for more credit crisis: increasing debt.
Global inequality may have gone down, but the trendline is upward: two hundred-fold the last two centuries. The largest component now involves between $600 trillion to over $1.2 quadrillion in unregulated derivatives. Will governments have enough credit to cover fallout from that? As it is, the global economy reeled from a 2008 crash that involved “only” a trillion dollars in subprime lending leading to over $30 trillion vaporized worldwide.
The issue isn’t money that’s used to cope with natural calamities but the resources that money can buy. Conventional oil production has barely gone up since 2005, and we are making up for increasing demand by using non-conventional sources which have lower energy returns. Meanwhile, the continued credit crisis has now led to calls for cuts in spending in many parts of the world while the effects of global warming can be seen in major floods and droughts which have disrupted food production, manufacturing, and mining in different parts of the world.
Finally, multiple organizations, including the IMF, the FAO, the IEA, the U.S. and German military, and various commercial banks and insurance companies are warning of combinations of problems involving higher debt, oil production problems, and availability of food supplies for the next few years.

Why are the developing 3rd world country’s charging ahead. Why is America in the Doldrums and barely moving? It’s called Spread the Wealth around. Obama is sending Billions of American dollars to 3rd world dictators, socialist and Islamist nations. Not to mention the fake global warming idiots that are sending money to junk country’s to boost their economy. What do they do with the Money? Well they compete with us. Use it against us, stock pile weapons. Funny thing about this last election. America is so full of stupid people now. They raised taxes on themselves. You can’t skim the cream off the milk without affecting the butter.

Who would have ever thought that the “best year ever” would have been almost completely financed with borrowed money?  This is like me living it up on a borrowed $100k and then bragging about how “well” I was doing.
Liberals can spin statistics to say anything.  My favorite is how the Bush Tax Rate Cuts “caused the deficit” despite the fact that revenues to the Treasury GREW by 49% in the 4 years following the rate reductions.  This worked splendidly until the Democrats in Congress forced banks to lend money to people with bad credit and no income and the housing bubble killed the economy.   
You see, all they need to do to “prove” the cuts caused the deficit is to count up the total cuts as a percentage of former revenues and ignore the corresponding INCREASE in revenues due to the resulting growth – oops!

Interesting sounding scenario you paint there, too bad is is not true.  I have observed some of the “Western companies pay workers crap and force them to work 20 hours a day.”  I’ll tell you about it.  During my military career. KBR (Halliburton) provided base support for troops in Haiti and again in Bosnia when I was in both places.  The local average wage in Haiti at the time was about $200.00 per year.  Haliiburton hired local civilians to work in our dining facility, they paid the lowest paid cooks $1000.00 per month.  The DFAC manager made $3000.00 per month. when we were there these employees were like millionaires to the local economy.   Yes they did work some long hours, but nothing more than the soldiers they served meals to.
Not exactly the abuse you describe.

Unfortunately the author ignores certain stark realities,primary among them is the overall dismay,concern and ennui that the average person in the U.K. and U.S. experiences when they  view their declining purchasing power, their decreased wages and increasing cost of living.Perception being 90% of reality, it is of no consequence that the numbers point to Eden when the average person awakes to mind-numbing anxiety over their finances.All of this results from an unchained  financial system that bets the taxpayers money in the casino known as the market with the resultant economic disaster being viewed  as a bit of bad luck.No need to worry,move along, nothing happening here.No new(actually old)restraints placed on the batty bankers by the politicians who were long ago purchased, at a discount, by the self-same Masters of the Universe.And the chances of future financial bubbles and financial disasters on an here-to-fore unknown scale stalks the average consumer.Having been bitten once by the rapacious financial beast, the average citizen knows it can happen again.If that citizen is over 30 they know it will happen again.And if they’ve stayed  informed they know that nothing has been done to restrain the financial behemoths, that the banks are feverishly looking for another way to make a buck on the backs of the average man and woman.They also realize that with the speed with which events unfold,especially financial  events aided by computer programs that regularly run away from  the control of their masters , when the next disaster hits it is likely to e more damaging than the last.But at least all is well with the world.






Rev. Diane Melograne



This is nonsense.  In light of 20 children and 9 teachers massacred at the Sandy Hook Elementary, the Aurora movie theater murders and the devastation of the recent tornadoes, Hurricane Sandy and extreme weather on the British coast, 2012 will certainly not be remembered as a Spectacular year.  Mankind will never be the world’s savior.  There is only one world’s Savior and He came to earth a little more than 2012 years ago.

What planet are you living on?  Why don’t people wake up and look at the real statistics.

Quote those statistics that make you feel better about the future of mankind, but no one, and I mean no one, can concentrate on only a small portion of statistics and claim that this is the best year ever in the history of mankind.  I believe a little more research is required for that specific claim.

Jenny Dahl Bakken



“Yet the achievement did not merit an official announcement, presumably
because it was not achieved by any government scheme but by the pace of
global capitalism. Buying cheap plastic toys made in China really is
helping to make poverty history.” – tell that to the factory workers deprived of rights who work themselves to death (I don’t mean that as a metaphor, I mean that literally) so we can buy products as cheap as possible. Slavery still exists, just now we pretend it’s okay as long as we pay as little as humanly possible for something we then sell for hundreds of dollars. And who gets the profit, the workers? No, the corporate bosses. As always. For the west to stay as rich as we are, we need to keep consuming. And to keep consuming, goods can’t be too expensive. If goods are to stay cheap, then wages in developing countries have to stay low. Our current system means we are dependent on some people being poor for us to stay as rich as we are.
“The doom-mongers will tell you that we cannot sustain worldwide economic
 growth without ruining our environment. But while the rich world’s
economies grew by 6 per cent over the last seven years, fossil fuel
consumption in those countries fell by 4 per cent. This remarkable (and, again, unreported) achievement has nothing to do with green taxes or wind farms. It is down to consumer demand for more efficient cars and factories.” – Well, we can’t sustain worldwide growth without ruining our environment. Why? 1) Because no resources, not even the planet iself, lasts forever. 2) If all countries consumed as much as the rich countries do, we would use up the resources faster than you have time to say “renewable”. Like it’s said, if everyone consumed as much as Americans we would need four Earths. 
So keep telling yourself that growth can last forever, the plain truth is that it can’t. The problem here is not the developing countries, though, it is the western world and our almost sickening over-consumption – which is again fuelled by capitalism, as corporations constantly have to create new markets and invent new products and raise new demand to keep making money. In other words, if we continue down this road we ARE screwed, no matter how well it might seem to be working now. 
And let’s not forget that thinking customer demand will change everything and make all corporations ethical is, at best, naive. At worst, dangerous. Corporations spend billions on PR and marketing because they want us all to think just that: We listen to you (and we care about humanity). And to some extent they do, if no one bought their products they would die slowly. But, on the other hand – the only thing they really listen to is the sound of increasing profits (however that sounds). If they make more money by landing suspicious deals with corrupt politicians then they will, no matter who suffers for it. If they save money by treating workers like shit then they will, and when confronted they will claim they did not know and that it’s not their fault, it’s the fault of one of their sub-contractors. As long as people in the west don’t know, what is the harm? As long as journalists write about price and esthetics instead of the ethics behind our production system then no one will care. It is exactly what they want. If people actually think multionational corporations got where they are today through good ethics, then that itself is scary. They know consumers care mostly about the price of goods, not how is was made. “Everyone” knows Coca Cola confiscates and pollutes the water of poor Indian villages. But no one cares, as long as they make nice christmas tv commercials and sell their products cheap. In other words: They COULD go full-fledged ethical and try to use that to sell products (which would naturally then cost more), but a vast majority would still buy the cheaper product, not because they’re evil but of economic reasons. 
That is the sad truth. Capitalism works because it applies to the bad in people, to the selfish in people. And a world filled with selfish people can never be a world that is just for everyone.

The U.S. has never before been so buried in dangerous, insurmountable debt and had so little growth, except in gov’t largesse and irresponsibility – it’s shameful. Europe is collapsing as we type. This silly outpouring of pampered liberal fantasy is the quintessence of everything that’s wrong in the West. The unfathomable depths of willful stupidity of greedy hypocrites running our governments and the morons who repeatedly elect them is destroying the foundations of liberty in the free world and around the globe, not to mention a minimum level of economic stability. I’d love to live in this author’s impenetrable kindergarten bubble. This is nothing but the self important, wishful thinking of a sheltered lefty for whom reality and critical thought are entirely absent. Seriously, go live in Iran or Cuba or Korea for a year and give us your flowery, hippy-dippy report then. Un-freaking-believable. Is there no thin ray of logic that can penetrate the cult-like blindness of the infantilized western leftist?

If you think this is leftist, you must be completely ignorant. This article masturbates to capitalism. Leftists do not.







Shiori_Uyoku



Your interpretation of Leftism is narrow at best. Correction: The article masturbates to the crony capitalism in the backward, totalitarian bits of the world, it does not celebrate or encourage a full return to the free market capitalism that once flourished in the United States or the UK or Japan – which is a typically leftist value. It hints that the ‘developing’ nations are improving somehow simply because the west is declining, as if the west were responsible for all global misery – also a tenant of the leftist cult. Finally, it utterly fails to see the predictable misery and failure of all varieties of Socialism and Green fanaticism around the world – total lefty moonbattery. Don’t like capitalism? Give away all private property to the poor and move to Cuba – ya know….”Utopia”. Yet, they never do…they prefer to keep all the benefits of capitalism while simultaneously, self-righteously, stupidly destroying the very source of wealth that sustains their insulated, material lives. Cheers.

Huh? Really?






John Q Public



you have to read this through the lens of the left…the fact that the us has record unemployment, debt, etc. IS the reason they think 2012 was such a great year.







Jenny Dahl Bakken



This is NOT due to to leftist policies, but the other way around. Capitalism isn’t something the left condones, yet this article embraces it with every fibre of its being.

Yet according to the article the leftists currently in power are free market capitalists.

This writer should have run for President last month, then we could have had 8 more perfect years, wow! LOL…

Yeah well, given my own experience with Canadians I wouldn’t advise anyone to be too sunny about them. In fact, I think Canadians are downright EVIL! I mean, every winter they come down here to South Florida and practice vehicular terrorism by keeping within the speed limits, making full stops at designated intersections and generally being courteous to other drivers! It’s intolerable to see these malicious aliens from the north set a good example to us! Damn them all, I say, DAMN THEM ALL!

I wanted to ask the author what was he smoking as I would like to have some, but since I’m living drug free life I guess I could buy pink eyeglasses and see the world in the same colors as the author does. 
Our profit driven economy seriously damaged our ecosystem, millions of people throughout the world demonstrating against their governments demanding more equality and jobs but their protests are ignored by big media, violent revolutions in Arab world created just more violence, in USA there are serous discussions about arming or not arming the school teachers in hope they will shoot the eventual shooters.          |
The author says “It may not feel like it, but 2012 has been the greatest year in the history of the world”. I agree with the first part of that sentence, it definitely doesn’t feel like it

Didn’t England post a 1% growth rate while holding an average 8% unemployment and 2.5% inflation rate this year? That is now “the best year ever”?

A little candy coated perspective for Christmas is not such a bad thing.  Thanks.
These are truths that also belong in the equation of our existence.

Global prosperity is up! Prosperity in the countries that had money is down. Go figure. People are living longer! Yet, far more obese (oops). War is almost a thing of the past! But the good news is, those Muslim countries that are prospering from western decline may all have nukes soon… so wait a bit for that to change. Energy is being more efficiently spent everywhere! Except in thirst world countries, and in first world countries only because the value of their currency plummets, and the price goes up exponentially not because of demand but rather greedy speculators. Life expectancy is way up! But of course, you won’t ever be able to retire now, since that is too expensive– sorry you paid into that your whole life and are just NOW being let down 50 years later (our bad). What a puff piece. Does this pass for news in the UK? I guess our American news is just as silly.

This conversation is ridiculous : ‘I’M more logical and compassionate, so fuck you’ is the general theme i’m seeing, or just straight up bashing. With the exception of a few well spoken individuals, you disgrace to what you represent. Make an intelligent statement about what you believe instead of trolling.

Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.  –   While thankful for a great many positives, world Christians at present are heartbroken over the taking of thousands of lives in Syria.  They are dumbfounded as to why the West remains so sheepled and dumbed down about what really is taking place there (for the West, Saudis, Turks, Qataris – to be removing another secular moderate regime – that will be replaced by an extremist Islamic one.  They are perplexed as to why the West does not hear the pleas of the Christian, Catholic and Orthodox leaders to NOT remove Assad’s regime – and that the media has totally distorted what is going on there.  —  World Christians mourn as LIbya is infinitely worse off than before the West’s “humanitarian intervention.”  Few Christians in Americal have researched the events in Libya and Syria to begin to understnad what took place there …and the horrible wrongs that were/are being perpetrated against these coiuntries.  — In the U.S. the disparity between the ‘haves and have nots continues to significantly grow.  But you have to do some in depth research to see this increasing difference in per capita income between the poor and more affluent.  Yes, praise God for any and every good thing and improvement..but let us not stay deaf to the voices of many Syrians cryout out tonight over loved ones killed TODAY by their conflict.

This is not left versus right. This is optimist versus pessimist. Some folks get all nuts when they hear good news because they thrive on bad news.

Interesting response anyone? http://manyfesto.net/2012/12/27/was-2012-really-the-best-year-ever/

I’d be weary about The Spectator’s claim of being “the best-written and most entertaining magazine in the English language.”
Let’s not fool ourselves, now.

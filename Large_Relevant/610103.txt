FDA warns company over unapproved flu remedyBy MATTHEW PERRONE | Associated Press – Tue, Jan 29, 2013

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators say a Florida company has been marketing an untested inhaled formula as a flu remedy in violation of drug safety regulations.
The Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission issued a warning letter to Flu and Cold Defense LLC for making misleading, unproven claims about its GermBullet inhaler.
The warning comes amid a worse-than-usual flu season that has hit the elderly particularly hard. So far, half of confirmed flu cases are in people 65 and older.
FDA regulators say they are seeing an uptick in bogus flu remedies, including fake flu vaccines, counterfeit antiviral drugs and air filters that allegedly remove the flu from the air.
"When there is a particular health issue in the news fraudulent products spike," said Howard Sklamberg, FDA's director of compliance. "So right now fraud products to prevent or treat the flu are big with scammers."
The Boca Raton, Fla.-based Flu and Cold Defense advertises the product as a "proprietary blend of 11 organic botanicals." The company's website claims that "an FDA recognized virology lab" tested the formula and "confirmed that it has the potential capability to kill cold and flu viruses."
But FDA regulators say the mixture has never been reviewed as safe and effective and the company is violating drug safety regulations.
All new drugs marketed in the U.S. must be submitted for approval to the FDA before they can be sold to consumers. Sklamberg says consumers should remember that "there aren't any legally marketed over-the-counter products to prevent or treat the flu."
The GermBullet is sold online through retailers like CVS.com and at a handful of small pharmacies and natural food stores in Florida.
A man reached by phone at Flu and Cold Defense's office could not immediately comment on the warning letter.
This year's flu season started about a month earlier than normal and the dominant flu strain is one that tends to make people sicker. The government doesn't keep a running tally of adult deaths from the flu, but estimates that it kills about 24,000 people most years. Vaccinations are recommended for anyone 6 months or older.
Flu and Cold Defense issued a news release early in the month saying GermBullet "may help protect you so your immune system is not overwhelmed as the flu reaches epidemic levels." FDA and FTC regulators take issue with that statement and a number of others from the company's website, including that the inhaler is "shown to reduce illness-causing bacteria, cold and flu viruses and fungi."
The letter, dated Jan. 24, was posted to the FDA's website Tuesday.
Regulators gave the company 15 business days to correct the problematic statements.
"The FTC strongly urges you to review all claims for your products and ensure that those claims are supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence," states the letter.
The FDA regularly issues warning letters to companies that do not follow regulations for manufacturing and promoting drugs and medical devices. The letters are not legally binding, but the FDA can take companies to court if they are ignored.

How about the FDA shuting down all the false ads on TV..from bigger boobs to weight loss.
Also...Doctors prescribe new drugs cause the drug companies fund their research..so many doctors are just front people for these companies...makes ya sick.

The FDA... the same people that approve drugs that have worst side effects than the actual illness.

This is the same FDA that approved a flame retardant to be used in drinks for the past 40 years. Gatorade is just now starting production on drinks that don't contain it. Still approved by the FDA but they are trying to do the right thing by taking it out.

One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives you
Don't do anything at all

Go ask Alice
When she's ten feet tall
And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall

Tell them a hookah-Smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
Call Alice when she was just small
When the men on the chess board get up and tell you where to go

And you just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving slow
Go ask Alice
I think she'll know

When logic and proportion
Have fallen SLOPPY dead
And the white knight is talking backwards
And the Red Queen's LOST her head
Remember what the dormouse said

The FDA protects industry, not citizens.

Having been in the "natural food and medicine" business for many years, I can tell you the people in that industry are every bit as crooked, if not moreso, than the people at the FDA.  

Don't assume everyone is bringing some bit of amazing medicine to the market that's being suppressed by Big Pharma and Big Government just because they claim it's natural and organic.  Look at the number of posters in this thread who are automatically claiming this product must obviously work because the FDA hasn't approved it.

Don't you think there are people out there who have been paying enough attention to see there are a lot of people who have that reaction?  Don't you think some of them will think "gee, I bet we could make a lot of money if we exploited that"?

I just took a look at the GermBullet's website.  It's nice, it's slick, and if you look at it very closely, it admits its product really hasn't been tested to see if it does what the company claims.

They're basing their claims on the fact that at some point in the past some laboratory somewhere studied the ingredients they're using, and came to the conclusion they might potentially have some germicidal properties, and on the fact they submitted their essential oil blend to a laboratory and it was discovered that it, too, showed some antibacterial action, which would seem to confirm their assertions, except... 

When you read the research, you discover:

A) the severely limited nature of the research done;
B) the dosing used in the labs was far beyond what you would get in the GermBullet; 
C) even at that dosing, the product showed only limited effectiveness on many of the organisms it was used to inoculate against, and 
D) it says right in the abstract that the laboratory doing the research concluded "future studies on the effect of GermBullet on the antimicrobial flora of the human respiratory tract will be necessary to determine the health benefits acquired from inhaling the blend...."

In other words, their own research comes right out and admits they haven't done enough research to find out if their product actually does what they claim.

The English language has a word to describe situations where someone tries to pass off their product as proven effective when their own data indicates more research needs to be done before that can be determined.  It's called 'lying.'

Any time someone starts to lie to you about how effective their product has been shown to be while asking you to give them money for it, you need to stop and ask yourself why they had to resort to trying to lie to you in order to get you to believe the product works.

So it's ok to give people pills and vaccines with tons of different chemicals but you cant buy something that is natural and organic. Sounds like another attack on natural and organic remedies to promote more big pharmaceutical drugs to me. I refuse medications and vaccines of any type. Pharmaceutical drugs kill more people every year than all illegal drugs combined, just look it up.

Is a 60/40 stock-bond mix the right balance?Is the 60/40 portfolio obsolete? 2 experts weigh in on best approach to stock-bond mixBy Mark Jewell, AP Personal Finance Writer | Associated Press – Thu, Jan 17, 2013

BOSTON (AP) -- Is it time to retire the idea of a 60/40 portfolio? The strategy has been generally regarded as a good starting point for most investors.
                  
But many experts question whether a mix of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds is suitable. Over the years, 60/40 has become a rough gauge for how to build adequate retirement savings without taking excessive risk. Typically, it's promoted as a sort of default portfolio balance for investors in their 40s, or even closer to retirement.
                  
The basic rationale: Keep most of your retirement savings in the stock market, because stocks are likely to provide greater long-term growth than bonds. But when stocks fall, you'll want a significant percentage of your portfolio in bonds to cushion against steep losses.
                  
That approach is under fire.  Many suggest it's important to have more than 60 percent invested in stocks. That's because retirement can stretch for several decades, and investors will need to increasingly rely on stocks to limit the risk of outliving savings. Also, the long-term outlook for bonds is poor. Their yields are near all-time lows and interest rates are certain to eventually climb.
                  
Another criticism: 60/40 is too narrow an approach to build a truly diversified portfolio because it fails to consider alternative assets classes. Think of investments in commodities such as oil, precious metals or real estate investment trusts. Alternatives may also include using complex strategies that hedge funds pioneered to protect against losses when stocks plunge or inflation spikes. These approaches may sound uncommon, but they're readily available. Hundreds of mutual funds using alternative assets or strategies have been launched in recent years.
                  
The Associated Press interviewed two experts in asset allocation — the mix of stocks, bond and alternatives in a portfolio — to try to get to the heart of the debate.
                  
One is a 60/40 critic: Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation for GMO, a Boston-based manager of $104 billion for institutional clients such as endowments and pension funds. He also co-manages Wells Fargo Advantage Absolute Return (WARAX), a mutual fund that uses alternative strategies.
                  
Also weighing in is Fran Kinniry, who embraces traditional stock-and-bond portfolio construction. He's a principal in the investment strategy group at Vanguard, the nation's largest mutual fund company, managing more than $2 trillion.
                  
Below are edited excerpts of their arguments on whether a 60/40 portfolio remains a good tool for middle-aged investors trying to build up retirement savings:
                  
INKER: One reason I'm skeptical about 60/40 is that it's probably not aggressive enough, at least for a 40-year-old investor. You need to invest more in assets that are riskier than bonds if you want to meet your investment goals without having to save an extremely large percentage of your income.
                  
If you're 40, you've got around 25 years before retirement. That's a long time. With significantly more than 60 percent in stocks, you'll have a much better chance to achieve your retirement savings goals than you would with just 60 percent. Your main investment goal at that point in life should be trying to generate the highest return on your savings.
                  
While an aggressive allocation to stocks makes sense at that age, that doesn't necessarily mean you can rely on alternative assets to diversify a portfolio. The problem that a 60/40 portfolio presents is that you can't rely entirely on bonds as a diversifier, either. They have been good diversifiers in recent years because we've had low inflation. In fact, higher-quality bonds like Treasury notes have been especially good diversifiers. But if the future risk we face is from rising inflation, bonds aren't going to help. They'll be lousy diversifiers, and will hurt your portfolio.
                  
KINNIRY: It's true that there are challenges now for investors with 60/40 portfolios, because of the risks bond investors face. It will be mathematically impossible to replicate the strong returns that bonds have delivered over the last 30 years.
                  
But I'd warn investors who want to leave traditional bonds for more exotic asset classes. It has not been demonstrated that those assets can diversify a portfolio when stocks are falling. We shouldn't expect alternative assets to provide a diversification benefit during the next bear market.
                  
Consider the performance of the larger college endowments that invested in alternative assets over the years. Traditional stock-bond portfolios have been killing many of those endowments in terms of performance. That's been the case whether you go back just one year, or three, five or 15 years. The attempt to get more exotic hasn't worked.
                  
It's true that a lot of alternative assets perform out of sync with the stock and bond markets, so that your portfolio will deliver steadier returns if you invest in alternatives. But the time that you really want diversification is when the primary asset in your portfolio — stocks — is falling sharply.
                  
Vanguard has done research examining the performance of various assets, including alternatives, when stock performance has been the worst — the bottom 10 percent of the performance spectrum, historically. Nearly all the assets posted losses at the same time that stocks were plunging. That was the case for everything from foreign stocks to real estate investment trusts to commodities, high-yield bonds, emerging markets bonds, hedge funds and private equity.
                  
There were only two assets that had positive returns during those periods: Treasury bonds, and investment-grade corporate and municipal bonds. That supports the case for maintaining a basic stock-and-bond mix in a portfolio.

My guess is that we will see a normal stock market correction (~10 to 15%), followed by a 10 to 20% reduction in medium and long term bond values, when the fed increases interest rates to stifle inflation during the next ~18 to 24 months. However, I am certainly not going to exit the stock or bond market because of this, just rebalance when it happens.

The stock market has returned ~11%/yr over the past ~60 years, ~6%/yr over the past 14 years. The stock market is the best vehicle to beat inflation long term, certainly not savings accounts and money market accounts. If one is hesitant to buy individual stocks, an easy solution is a low cost, no load, index fund (Vanguard). Bonds have done better during the past ~decade than stocks, but when the recession really ends and the Fed increases interest rates to stifle inflation, bonds, particularly long term bond,s will take a hit. My guess is that during the next ~2 years, we will have a ~10 to 15% stock market correction, followed by ~10 to 20% losses in bond funds, particularly mid- and long term bond funds. I'm still going to keep ~60% in stocks (and rebalance to 55% if the market goes up 10%, 65% if the market drops 10%) ~15% in short term bond funds, ~15% in commercial real estate funds, and ~10% in cash. I need ~2.5 years of cash, since I'm retired and I'm pulling money out of my retirement accounts.

I tend to be a perma-bull.  But now this scares me.  When the pundits start saying that investors should overweight their portfolios in stocks, then I know that these people are on a proverbial sugar high from surging equity markets.

I am willing to bet that back in March of 2009, when the US markets had lost half of their value, that these same pundits were nowhere to be found, pushing investment into the more risky asset class of stocks.

I mostly agree that stocks are generally a better bet for long term gains, IF you have the time and IF you have the tenacity to just ignore that chatter and stick with a game plan of dollar cost averaging.  But there are still risks involved and when stocks get hammered, they really get hammered.

The S&P is near an all time high and the media tells you it's time to go all in stocks?  Looks like it's time to sell.  The media is always wrong.

Only if you are ready to lose everything when the bond bubble bursts as it must when the massive counterfeiting by the Federal Reserve finally catches up with the economy and price inflation and interest rates go through the roof.  Not that the stock market is any less manipulated or corrupt.

Sound corporate bonds may be worthwhile with sound companies, but get every penny out of Treasuries.  This country is so far beyond bankrupt only a complete idiot would invest further in their shell game of money manipulation and endless debt.

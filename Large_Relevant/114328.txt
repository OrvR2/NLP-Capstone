On Friday, March 30, 2012, Hisham Y. Altalib visited the White House. According to visitor logs, Altalib was received by Joshua DuBois, the director of President Obama's Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Four days later, White House officials welcomed a foreign delegation of the radical Sharia-enforcing Muslim Brotherhood from Egypt.
The White House meeting with overseas Muslim Brotherhood leaders was reported in April by a few mainstream journalists and questioned loudly by conservative media. But the White House confab in March with U.S.-based Altalib — which appears to be a prep session with the global Muslim Brotherhood's American advance team — has received no attention until now.
So, who is Hisham Yahya Altalib? What is his agenda?
And why exactly did the Obama administration conduct domestic "faith-based" outreach with this Muslim Brotherhood figure in Virginia, who just happens to be 1) tied to bloody jihad and 2) a major contributor to the left-wing Center for Constitutional Rights, the group of jihadi-sympathizing lawyers who helped spring suspected Benghazi terror plotter Abu Sufian bin Qumu from Gitmo?
Altalib is an Iraqi-born Muslim identified by the FBI as a Muslim Brotherhood operative before he moved to America in the 1970s to earn an advanced electrical engineering degree from Purdue University in Indiana. By his own account, Altalib "soon became active in Islamic work in North America, which continues to this day."
He was the "first full-time director of the Leadership Training Department of the Muslim Students Association of the United States and Canada (MSA)" — a longtime Muslim Brotherhood front group whose explicit goal is to "conquer" America through Islamic propagandizing.
Altalib is also a founding member of the SAAR Foundation and the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT). Last year, his online biography proudly notes, he was "awarded the ISNA (Islamic Society of North America) Community Service Award." The Saudi-subsidized ISNA is regarded as the primary U.S. umbrella group for Muslim Brotherhood fronts and was named specifically by the global MB godfathers as a key player in their "Grand Jihad" strategy of infiltration from within.
SAAR was founded in Herndon, Va., in 1983 as part of a radical Islamic charity front for Saudi financiers called the SAFA Group. The feds raided SAAR's offices in 2002 as part of Operation Green Quest. Investigators confiscated 500 boxes and seven trucks' worth of documents illuminating the network's terror ties to the Al Taqwa Bank (a Swiss-based Muslim bank suspected of funding the 9/11 plot) and the Muslim Brotherhood.
Altalib worked for one of Al Taqwa Bank's main owners, Youssef Nada. Altalib's more prominent Muslim Brotherhood partner, Jamal Barzinji (one of the champions of the Ground Zero mosque), also worked for Nada. FBI and Customs officials believe SAAR/SAFA laundered money for a plethora of violent Muslim terrorist groups, from Hamas and Hezbollah to al-Qaida and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Along with several other leaders of the "Ikhwan" (brothers), Altalib and Barzinji established the International Institute of Islamic Thought in Herndon, Va., in 1985. Global Muslim Brotherhood thug Yusuf al-Qaradawi — the fire-breathing, fatwa-issuing Jew-hater and violent jihad proselytizer — inspired IIIT's mission: the "Islamization of social sciences."
According to Steven Merley of the Hudson Institute's Center on Islam, Democracy, and the Future of the Muslim World, IIIT has 14 affiliated offices across the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy, who put 1993 World Trade Center bombing mastermind Omar Abdel Rahman behind bars, notes that IIIT was a demonstrated unindicted co-conspirator in the feds' Holy Land Foundation terror financing case. IIIT supported convicted terror aides Sami Al-Arian and Abdel Rahman Alamoudi.
Altalib, Barzinji and IIIT were also all listed in funding statements from the Center for Constitutional Rights as major donors giving in the $25,000 to $49,000 range.
CCR is the umbrella group providing more than 500 pro bono lawyers to Gitmo detainees. They have regularly dismissed national security concerns about Gitmo recidivism as "irresponsible ... scare stories." That's exactly what they did after one of CCR's clients, Libyan terror leader Abu Sufian bin Qumu, was sprung in 2007.
Fast-forward five short years. Qumu is now the lead suspect in the 9/11/12 attack on our U.S. consulate in Benghazi that resulted in the murders of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, consular official Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALs/private security contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods. In the wake of this month's terrorist attacks on our Egyptian embassy, Libyan consulate and Afghan air base, the jihad helpers at CCR are stone silent.
This administration's idea of domestic "faith-based outreach" is tea with Muslim Brotherhood community organizers who have embedded themselves in American life for four decades with the express intent of "eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within." Meanwhile, our commander in chief is squawking to the world about YouTube videos. The Ikhwan are laughing their bloodstained robes off.

The sweetest sound I know is the Muslim call to prayer” – Feb. 28, 2008 Barack Hussein Obama.
"I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction”, page 216 of Obama’s book “Audacity Of Hope”.

WHY would anyone Doubt Obama's allegience to Muslims, Muslim Terrorists, Muslim
Brotherhood?   He invites them to the WH, Pentagon, aids, welfares, wars for, supplies
weapons to, coddles, placates, and lies for them before the entire World.

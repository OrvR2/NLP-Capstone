Blog Posts by Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsBoehner invites Obama to give State of the Union on Feb. 12By Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Jan 11, 2013Tweet0
President Barack Obama delivers remarks at the White House on Nov. 28, 2012. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)Republican House Speaker John Boehner on Friday formally invited President Barack Obama to deliver his State of the Union address on Feb. 12.
“Our nation continues to face immense challenges, and the American people expect us to work together in the new year to find meaningful solutions,” Boehner said in a letter to Obama released by the speaker’s office. “This will require a willingness to seek common ground as well as presidential leadership.
“For that reason, the Congress and the Nation would welcome an opportunity to hear your plan and specific solutions for addressing America’s great challenges,” the lawmaker continued. “Therefore, it is my privilege to invite you to speak before a Joint Session of Congress on February 12, 2013, in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol Building.”
Obama will get two high-profile opportunities to address the country (and the world) within just a few weeks. He will make his inaugural address on Jan. 21, laying out his broad vision for his second term

NRA blasts Biden talks, says it won’t help gun-control pushBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Jan 10, 2013Tweet0

Not that there was ever much doubt, but the National Rifle Association bluntly declared on Thursday that it would not cooperate with any White House drive for gun control in the aftermath of the elementary school slaughter in Newtown, Conn.
“We were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment,” the powerful lobbying group said in a statement after talks with Vice President Joe Biden.
"While claiming that no policy proposals would be 'prejudged,' this task force spent most of its time on proposed restrictions on lawful firearms owners—honest, taxpaying, hardworking Americans," the NRA said. "It is unfortunate that this administration continues to insist on pushing failed solutions to our nation's most pressing problems."
Biden has been leading a task force with the job of coming up with recommendations for battling what President Barack Obama calls an epidemic of gun violence across America. The vice president is due to present his recommendations to Obama on Tuesday after a range of discussions with gun-violence victims groups, law enforcement officials, organizations that represent gun owners, and officials from the entertainment industry. Obama has already pressed Congress to renew the assault weapons ban and take up new restrictions on owning large-capacity magazines—two steps the NRA opposes.

Obama: Treasury nominee Lew will fix his signatureBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Jan 10, 2013Tweet0
President Barack Obama formally nominates White House chief of staff Jack Lew to succeed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)President Barack Obama on Thursday formally nominated White House chief of staff Jack Lew to succeed departing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner—but joked that Lew’s now-famously loopy signature had almost cost him the job.
“I had never noticed Jack’s signature,” Obama said in a ceremony in the White House’s East Room, with both men in attendance. “When this was highlighted yesterday in the press, I considered rescinding my offer to appoint him.
“Jack assures me that he is going to work to make at least one letter legible in order not to debase our currency should he be confirmed as secretary of the Treasury,” the president added, drawing laughs from the audience.
[Interactive: What would your signature look like if Jack Lew wrote it?]
Obama has been filling out key posts ahead of the official beginning of his second term. He has also nominated Democratic Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry to be secretary of state, Republican former Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to be secretary of Defense, and White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan to head the CIA.
The president, who takes the oath of office in not quite two weeks, appears to be choosing trusted advisers for key positions—people who have already had a hand in shaping his policies, not breath-of-fresh-air outsiders who might try to steer his second term in a radically new direction. He has also disappointed some observers who had hoped for a more diverse second-term Cabinet.

Geithner made no mention of Lew’s signature, which resembles an aerial photo of the trajectory of an out-of-control Zamboni. But Lew happily got in on the act.

Obama signs law giving himself, Bush lifetime Secret Service guardBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Jan 10, 2013Tweet0
President Barack Obama, accompanied by a Secret Service agent, waves at reporters shouting questions. (Charles Dharapak/AP)Former presidents have to give up rides on Air Force One. But now they don't have to give up being shadowed by the armed-and-earpieced bodyguards of the Secret Service.
President Barack Obama on Thursday signed into a law a measure giving him, George W. Bush and future former presidents and their spouses lifetime Secret Service protection, the White House announced.
The legislation, crafted by Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, rolls back a mid-1990s law that imposed a 10-year limit on Secret Service protection for former presidents. Bush would have been the first former commander in chief affected.
At the time, lawmakers who supported the measure said it would save the government millions of dollars. They also argued that former presidents could hire private security firms (as Richard Nixon did after he decided to forgo Secret Service protection in 1985).

Why Obama likes Lew to lead TreasuryBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Jan 9, 2013Tweet0
This Jan. 9, 2012, file photo shows then-White House budget director Jack Lew listening as President Barack Obama speaks in the State Dining Room of the White House. (Susan Walsh/AP)President Barack Obama is expected, as early as Thursday, to announce that he has picked White House chief of staff Jack Lew to succeed departing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.
In doing so, according to a source close to the process, Obama is drafting a trusted confidant who played a key role in crafting popular Clinton-era economic policies.
If confirmed by the Senate, Lew, 57, would take the reins from Geithner just in time for a series of confrontations with congressional Republicans on everything from raising the debt ceiling to averting automatic domestic and defense spending cuts to deciding how much to fund government agencies after a stopgap measure expires in late March.
So why pick Lew? The source, who strongly supports the president and Lew—and who declined to confirm published news reports that Obama had settled on the soft-spoken economic policy wonk—laid out a three-part “Why Obama would pick Lew” argument to Yahoo News.

NRA to attend Biden’s gun meeting on ThursdayBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Jan 8, 2013Tweet0
Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, Feb. 8, 2011 (Larry Downing/Reuters)Vice President Joe Biden, set to unveil his post-Newtown recommendations on gun violence later this month, will host a meeting Thursday that will include a representative from the National Rifle Association, White House officials said Tuesday.
The White House said that Biden will first meet Wednesday with groups that represent victims of gun violence, as well as officials from gun-safety organizations. On Thursday, he will meet with “advocates for sportsmen and -women and gun ownership groups," per the White House.
The vice president will also meet this week with “representatives of the entertainment and video game industries" and hold conference calls with elected officials.
The NRA will send a representative to the Thursday meeting "to hear what they have to say," according to NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam.
The organization has vowed to resist new gun control measures, pushing instead for armed guards at schools.
President Barack Obama is “skeptical that putting more guns in schools would solve this problem,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday.

Congress more popular than Kardashians, Lohan, gonorrheaBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Jan 8, 2013Tweet0
Kim Kardashian hosts ICED at Cowboys Dance Hall in Calgary, Jan. 4, 2013. (Mike Ridewood/Getty Images)Good news, Congress! You’re more popular than telemarketers, the deadly ebola virus, gonorrhea, the Kardashians, Lindsay Lohan, communism, disgraced Democratic former Sen. John Edwards, playground bullies and meth labs.
Bad news, Congress! Americans still have a higher opinion of head lice, colonoscopies, cockroaches, Nickelback, the NFL replacement refs, and Donald Trump.
Those are the findings of the latest they-have-way-too-much-fun-over-there survey by Public Policy Polling, which found that the legislative branch’s approval rating is mired at 9 percent. A whopping 85 percent of respondents said they disapproved. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.
Public Policy Polling pitted Congress against a series of unpleasant things or unpopular people, and the results were not flattering for lawmakers. This will come as no surprise to some of the legislative branch’s critics, including Republican Sen. John McCain, who has said that only blood relatives and paid staffers think Congress is doing a good job.
So: Did respondents have a higher opinion of Congress or root canals? Congress gets drilled, 32 percent to 56 percent. NFL replacement refs? Easy call: Congress loses 29 to 56 percent. Head lice? Congress loses 19 to 67 percent (head-scratcher: the 15 percent who said they weren’t sure). Nickelback? Congress gets rocked 32 to 39 percent. Colonoscopies? Up yours, Congress, 31 to 58 percent. Inside-the-Beltway pundits? Here the Sabbath gasbags and their ilk eke it out 37 to Congress's 34 percent. Donald Trump? You’re (barely) fired, Congress, you get 42 percent, versus the pundits' 44 percent. And cockroaches scurry away with a 45 to 43 percent win.

Obama nominates Hagel for Defense, Brennan for CIABy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Mon, Jan 7, 2013Tweet0
(Left to right): Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, Defense Secretary-nominee Chuck Hagel, President Barack Obama, CIA Director-nominee John Brennan and acting CIA Director Michael Morell at a White House event on Jan. 7, 2013 (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)President Barack Obama on Monday nominated Republican former Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to be defense secretary, and top White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan to be CIA director. Obama pressed the Senate to confirm them quickly, warning "we don't like to leave a lot of gaps" in senior national security posts.
"Chuck Hagel is the leader that our troops deserve," the president said in a ceremony in the White House's East Room, flanked by the former lawmaker, Brennan, outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, and acting CIA director Michael Morell.
Obama's announcement was his latest move to round out his second-term Cabinet, following his nomination of Democratic Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. He is also expected to name a new treasury secretary soon to replace the departing Timothy Geithner.
With both Hagel and Brennan expected to face a fight in the Senate, the president used his remarks to squeeze wary lawmakers.
“I hope that the Senate will act on these confirmations promptly. When it comes to national security, we don’t like to leave a lot of gaps between the time that one set of leaders transitions out and another transitions in," Obama said. “So we need to get moving quickly on this.”
Republican resistance to Hagel had been building before the official announcement. And even as Obama spoke, Sen. John McCain, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will vet Hagel's nomination, said he had "serious concerns about positions" his former colleague "has taken on a range of critical national security issues in recent years."
Hagel, who earned two Purple Hearts in Vietnam and still carries shrapnel in his chest, would be the first former enlisted soldier to head the Pentagon. But his nomination has drawn fire from  Republican senators, who point to his votes against sanctions on Iran and complaints about the pro-Israel "Jewish lobby."
Hagel has also moved to defuse objections from the gay and lesbian community over remarks he made in 1998, when he criticized James Hormel, President Bill Clinton's choice for ambassador to Luxembourg, for being "openly, aggressively gay." He apologized last week, calling the remark "insensitive."
White House officials expect a confirmation fight—but say it is one they will ultimately win. They predict that Hagel, who served two terms in the Senate and left office in January 2009, will face tough questions about administration plans for implementing spending cuts at the Pentagon, the increasingly tense standoff over Iran's nuclear program and the looming troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.

New Congress, old ways: D.C.’s angry politics aren’t going awayBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Jan 4, 2013Tweet0
Vice President Joe Biden shakes hands with House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio in the House Chamber before the counting of Electoral College votes on Capitol Hill on Friday. (Susan Walsh/AP)As the 113th Congress took the oath of office together this week, newly minted representatives and senators posed with their kids. Democrats celebrated unprecedented diversity at the Capitol (sometimes, ahem, less than completely honestly). Vice President Joe Biden was, well, in fine Biden form. Republican House Speaker John Boehner stirringly told veteran legislators “maybe it’s time we feel awestruck again” and warned newcomers against the siren songs of fame and partisanship.
“If you have come here to see your name in lights or to pass off political victory as accomplishment, you have come to the wrong place. The door is behind you,” Boehner said from the speaker's chair.
But Republican Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia, who has been in Congress since 1993, took to Twitter to speak a little truth to, and about, power. “Today we're sworn in. Tomorrow we're sworn at. Both are great honors. God Bless America!”
Kingston’s dry observation reflected the simple fact that the turnover in Congress most likely won’t change the way Washington does business.
How weird and toxic are the country’s politics? The White House couldn’t even provide a named official to disclose that President Barack Obama had talked by telephone with Boehner and Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. That information came from an anonymous “senior administration official.”
From “the more things change…” department, Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann tweeted that she had introduced a bill to repeal Obamacare. Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen re-introduced the DISCLOSE Act against anonymous political spending. Oh, and while former Republican Rep. Ron Paul is gone from Congress, his “Audit the Fed” proposal was introduced by Republican Rep. Paul Broun of Georgia.
And within a day, a prominent senator, Republican John Cornyn of Texas, was warning Obama that Republicans are prepared to shut down the government as a show of seriousness about cutting spending.
It’s not that absolutely nothing will change. New members on key committees could shake things up a bit: Republican Sen. Rand Paul is joining the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren will serve on the Senate Banking Committee. And Obama is overseeing a major Cabinet reshuffle at the start of his second term—new secretaries of State, Treasury and Defense, among others—while pursuing objectives like comprehensive immigration reform and a push for gun control in the aftermath of the tragedy in Newtown, Conn.
But confrontational politics are here to stay.

Obama inauguration store: $10 shot glass, $7,500 medallionsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Jan 3, 2013Tweet0
A pair of "Bo" Obama buttons on sale at the 57th Presidential Inauguration Store (photo: Inauguration store)Do you really like President Barack Obama? Are you really, really excited that he won re-election? Has the "fiscal cliff" deal somehow left you with $7,500 burning a hole in your pocket? Then step right up to the official store of the 57th presidential inauguration.
Taking a page from the Obama campaign’s successful online store, the 2013 Presidential Inauguration Committee has launched an online site where Americans can pick up everything from $15 tube socks (“a fun and stylish way to commemorate the 57th Presidential Inauguration” the site says) to a set of silver and gold medallions with a $7,500 price tag (“comes with a certificate of authenticity and decorative display box,” the site says. Beware the inauthentic presidential inauguration medallions).
Do you have Republicans on your gift list? There’s a $10 shot glass for mourning in America, or a $35 set of glasses for a thousand pints of light.

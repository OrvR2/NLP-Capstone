Gun debate 101: Time to ban high-capacity magazines?President Obama proposes banning high-capacity magazines in a bid to make mass shootings less likely. But gun rights advocates worry that the ammo ban is a sleeper provision that will, ultimately, make many handguns illegal, as well.By Patrik Jonsson | Christian Science Monitor – Wed, Jan 16, 2013

Adam Lanza, police say, used at least 150 bullets shot from an AR-15 assault-style rifle during his attack on the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14 – killing 26 children and staff, and shocking the nation into a tumultuous debate over gun control.
Using the standard 30-bullet magazine that comes with the rifle, Mr. Lanza would have had to detach the springloaded magazines that pump each cartridge into the chamber only four times, as he fired relentlessly into two classrooms full of grade-school children. James Holmes, using a "drum magazine" that held 100 rounds, shot 70 people in an Aurora, Colo., theater in July in fewer than 90 seconds, police say.
That's why a ban on so-called "large-capacity" magazines is at the top of a gun control reform proposal by President Obama on Wednesday, which also includes banning assault-style rifles and beefing up background checks, among other actions.

Second Amendment Quiz

The proposed ban on devices that are, in essence, small bullet-packed boxes with springs is an attempt to confront their popularity among gun enthusiasts. As New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) questioned: Who needs more than seven bullets to kill a dear? Advocates of a ban say the ubiquity of large-capacity magazines contributes to bloodshed.
But gun rights activists challenge whether banning high-capacity magazines will reduce lethality in mass shooter-type situations. They question whether the ultimate motivation for regulating how many bullets Americans can jam into their guns at one time is to make criminals out of lawful rifle owners – and, eventually, to make standard handguns harder legally to use for self-defense.
Here's a primer on the current state of law on high-capacity ammunition magazines and how that might change with the new regulations proposed by Mr. Obama.
What is a 'high-capacity' magazine, and how many are in circulation?
Guns such as the AR-15 rifle and the Glock 17 pistol have magazines, or springloaded cartridge feeding devices, that hold more than 10 bullets, the limit proposed by Obama. Those magazines were technically illegal during the 1994-2004 assault weapons ban. (Several loopholes allowed manufacturers to make cosmetic changes to keep some versions legal.)
Gun control advocates such as Governor Cuomo, who on Jan. 15 signed the nation's first post-Newtown gun restrictions, suggest that regular Americans don't need the ability to shoot large numbers of continuous bullets for hunting or standard self-defense. Gun rights advocates say that it's not up to the government to decide what gun owners need for self-protection, and that new laws would only serve to criminalize lawful gun owners, while criminals would get hold of illegal magazines and guns anyway.
Experts estimate that as many as 40 million high-capacity magazines may be in circulation today in the US.
Have "high-capacity" magazine bans worked before?
While task forces concluded that the 1994 assault-weapons ban and bans on large-capacity magazines didn't noticeably effect violent-crime rates or mass shootings in the US either way, some evidence does show that such set-ups were used fewer times during the commission of crimes in some US cities during the 10-year span of the ban.
Studies have also found that casualty rates of mass shootings have increased after the assault weapons ban expired in 2004. Police in Virginia, for example, found far fewer high-capacity magazines at crime scenes in 2004 than they did in 2010. Gun critics point to those statistics to argue that larger magazines contribute to greater bloodshed.
What would the Obama plan do?
Obama's proposal bans high-capacity magazines with more than 10 rounds. To what extent currently owned magazines would be "grandfathered" or legalized, and whether people using them would have to register with the federal government, is not yet clear.
However a Senate bill sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) of California would ban dozens of guns as well as require gun owners to register "grandfathered" weapons and magazines in a national registry. Other proposals suggest that grandfathered weapons and magazines would have to be re-registered every five years.
Gun control advocates say smaller magazines would increase chances that bystanders, victims, or law enforcement officials could disrupt a mass shooting. During the shooting in Tuscon two years ago, gunman Jared Loughner was tackled to the ground as he tried to reload after firing 30 shots, killing six people and injuring then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.
Would the magazine ban become a de facto handgun ban?
The administration has said it has no designs on limiting people's ability to hunt or own guns for home protection. But gun rights advocates argue that if the ban on high-capacity magazine goes into effect, many handguns that are not explicitly prohibited in the president's proposal could become illegal.
Gun Owners of America says up to 80 percent of US handguns and 50 percent of all long rifles could become suddenly suspect under Obama's proposal, largely because of the magazine issue. The popular Glock 17 handgun, for example, has a 17-bullet magazine. Glocks are among the nation's most popular self-defense handgun, and also rank among guns used most often in gun violence.
"Depending on whether they grandfather, lots of gun owners won't be able use their Glocks, since the magazine ban goes to most Glocks," says Michael Hammond, legislative consultant for the conservative Gun Owners of America organization in Springfield, Va.
Gun rights advocates also point to a recent case in Georgia, where a mom with twins fought off an intruder by shooting all six bullets from a snubnosed revolver. While she hit the intruder five times, he was still able to flee and get into his car before he was found by police.
"Why should she have been limited to just those six or seven rounds?" wonders Larry Ward, founder of this Saturday's first-ever Gun Appreciation Day.
Nevertheless, Robert Levy, a conservative lawyer who helped win the landmark District of Columbia v. Heller gun rights case in 2008, says one reason the Obama administration is proposing a large-capacity magazine ban is because it's likely to be upheld in the courts.
"I can imagine a shop owner in the midst of a riot and he says he needs multiple rounds to protect his store and family," Mr. Levy told the Washington Post recently. "I can also imagine the multi-victim killings like we had in Newtown where there's a reasonable argument that innocent lives might have been saved if these magazines had been banned and if the ban had been effective. So I think if government can show … the benefits of banning high-capacity magazines, then I have no doubt that such a ban would survive a court challenge."

Guns have only two enemies rust and politicians.

Its always better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6.

Cops carry guns to protect themselves, not you.

Never let someone or something that threatens you get inside arms length.

Never say "Ive got a gun." If you need to use deadly force, the first sound they hear should be the safety clicking off.

The average response time of a 911 call is 23 minutes, the response time of a .357 magnum is 1400 feet per second.

The most important rule in a gunfight is: Always win - cheat if necessary.

Make your attacker advance through a wall of bullets . . You may get killed with your own gun, but he'll have to beat you to death with it, cause it'll be empty.

If you're in a gun fight: a- If you're not shooting, you should be loading. b- If you're not loading, you should be movin, c- If you're not movin', you're dead.

In a life and death situation, do something . . .
It may be wrong, but do something!

If you carry a gun, people call you paranoid. Nonsense! If you have a gun, what do you have to be paranoid about?

You can say 'stop' or 'alto' or any other word, but a large bore muzzle pointed at someone's head is pretty much a universal language.

You cannot save the planet, but you may be able to save yourself and your family.

' As New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) questioned: Who needs more than seven bullets to kill a dear?'

The Second Amendment is not about killing deer or hunting.  It is about our ability to protect ourselves from the Fascistic leftist government that we are now facing!

"Using the standard 30-bullet magazine that comes with the rifle,"

 Even in this slanted article which is pure propaganda they point that a 30 round magazine is not a high capacity magazine it is standard sized magazine. As such a high capacity magainze would be the 40-60 round "Banana" magazines and the 100 and 200 round box or beta magazines. 

 The only exception I can think to this rule for weapons civilians are allowed to own is the PS90 which fires the 5.7X28 round and has a standard 50 round magazine. Every other weapon civilians can easily own have 30 rounds or smaller for the standard sized magazine

Lanza DID NOT use an AR! The AR was found in the trunk of his car. He had 4 handguns on him. 
Also, Yahoo! Your math sucks! "Using the standard 30-bullet magazine that comes with the rifle, Mr. Lanza would have had to detach the springloaded magazines that pump each cartridge into the chamber only four times". To shoot 150 rounds from 30 round magazines, he would need to change magazines 5 times. 
Why do you (the liberal media) continue to kiss Ofukno's a--? You fuktards are a part of the reason our country is so screwed up! 
If you can't be ACCURATE on reporting the news, you need to be shut down! You need to quit printing LIES! #$%$ YOU YAHOO!

Think of all the crimes that involve people using computers - maybe we should ban all of those with more than 7 bytes of memory in them - or more than 7 keys on a detachable keyboard, or more than 7 colors on the screen, or ....................

To prove banning high capacity magazines works, all you have to do is look at Columbine, Jonesboro, the Jewish Community Center and other shootings...WAIT, those were all after the Clinton ban.  Never mind.

The Virginia Tech shooter had only a 9mm and a .22 with 10 round capacity and no one could stop him. Maybe if just one of those students could have had their legally licensed weapon with them.

 67% have at least one felony arrest.
56% have two or more felony arrests.
70% have at least one conviction.
54% have at least one felony conviction.

 "In 1998, the 75 largest counties accounted for 37% of the U.S. population. According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports program for 1998, these jurisdictions accounted for 50% of all reported serious violent crimes in the United States."

A Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report (Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1983 (pdf) Beck, A., Shipley B, April 1989) shows within "3 years after their release from prison in 1983, an estimated 62.5% of the released prisoners had been rearrested; 46.7% had been reconvicted; and 41.4% had been reincarcerated."

"An estimated 67,898 of the 108,580 prisoners who were released in 1983 were rearrested and charged with 326,746 new offenses by year end 1986. More than 50,000 of the new charges were violent offenses, including 2,282 homicides..."

"Those released after serving time for murder or non negligent manslaughter were nearly 5 times more likely than other prisoners to be rearrested for homicide." 

 Boston - An analysis of knife and gun youth homicides from 1990 to 1994 found 77% of offenders and 75% of victims had prior arraignments in Massachusetts. The offenders averaged 9.7 charges per killer and 9.5 offenses per victim. 54% of the known killers had been sentenced to probation versus 42% of the victims. (25% of the known offenders committed homicide while on probation.) (Kennedy, David M. et al. 1996. "Youth Violence in Boston: Gun Markets, Serious Youth Offenders, and a Use-reduction Strategy." Law and Contemporary Problems. Vol. 59, no. 1. P. 148)

"Probation officers said that it was rare to lose a kid to gun violence who had not previously been on probation, and the dark joke among gang officers was whether it would be ethical to take out life insurance on certain kids." (Kennedy, et al. P. 158.)

Baltimore - "In 1997, when the Baltimore City Police Department analyzed internal data on shootings, it found that more than 50 percent of victims and suspects were age 24 and younger. It also found that most violence was caused by violent drug 'crews' that were using handguns to settle disputes." (Source)

Los Angeles - A review of all drive-by shootings in Los Angeles in 1991 in which a child or adolescent under the age of 18 was shot at, injured, or killed reported 86% of homicide victims were documented members of violent street gangs (p.326) and 71% of all victims were gang members (p.325). (Hutson, H. Range, et al. Feb. 3, 1994. "Adolescents and children injured or killed in drive-by shootings in Los Angeles." The New England Journal of Medicine. Vol 330, no. 5.)

how about reporting that the shooter at Virginia Tech did not have high capacity magazines? Oh that's right, doesn't fit the narrative.

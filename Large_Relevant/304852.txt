Hey.. Great Video.

I grew up in St Petersburg about that time and remember it well. Loved Webb's City and the free double header creme cone with a hair cut. Webb's had 29 Barbers in that store. Webs special gasoline at 19.9. 

Too bad St Petersburg demolished the old Million Dollar Pier. There about ready to demolish that upside down pyramid monstrosity and build a totally new pier and structure. 

 Thanks for the pleasant memories!

Looks like the plane was overloaded. Years ago a friend bought a Piper Warrior with the 150 Lycoming that ran on pump gas. Four of us piled in on a hot humid summer day and took off and dang near didn't make it. We must have missed a nearby roof by 50 ft. Of course they blamed it on me, saying I turned a 4 place aircraft into a 3!

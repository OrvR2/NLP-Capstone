A good advice is a person should never go to a crowded and totally enclosed place such as this nightclub. But if you are somehow forced to go e.g. by your employers, then always sit or stand near﻿ the exit so that you will be one of the first to get out if something foes wrong. It can be a fire, a gun fight or even an earthquake. You will always be one of the first to get out.

In the first place, how did this nightclub get a licence to operate when they had " no fire alarms, no water sprinklers and no proper exits " ? Their authorities obviously did not learn any lesson from the tragic nightclub fires that happened all over the world such as in US, Russia﻿ and Thailand where scores and hundreds of people died. Sadly neither did the patrons of that establishment.

I was thinking along the same lines as yourself. In the Bangkok Santika nightclub fire that killed 66 people on Dec 2008, the house﻿ band playing that night was called "Burn" and for the theme decoration purposes , they had crosses and coffins on the wall. Everytime such nightclub fires happened, they somewhat appear to be like human sacrifices to the devil. People should quickly wised up about the danger of being in crowded nighclubs.

A chain of events that led to this tragedy. Band producer asked the cheaper and dangerous fireworks and the seller knew he'd use it inside the club but sold it anyway. Club owners installed a cheap and unsafe insulation.﻿ The fire department didnt inspect the nightclub. It had its license expired but the Mayor didnt shut it down.

I am Brazilian, but from Recife, in the northeastern coast. That was really horrible... They said in news here that 1 more person died and that there﻿ should be space for about 500 people, but instead there were 1,000. That's why escaping was hard and so much more people died or got injured than if there were the right maximum number of people.

RIP to the victims of this nightclub fire tragedy.﻿ :-( My thoughts & condolences go out to the victims' families. This story makes me think of one of my ex-boyfriends. He's a radio station & nightclub DJ. And he lives in South America now. He's fortunate that he has never been trapped or involved in nightclub accidents & tragedies. He said he always asked how a nightclub is set up before he even agrees to do big nightclub gigs in U.S. & South America. It's sad that too many lives were lost. :-(

Look up 02/20/2003 The Station Nightclub Fire﻿ and the comparisons are astonishing.
If there's one thing true about history, it's that humans do not learn from history; thus choosing to repeat it.

Retroactive code enforcement....typical shit hole country. Of course, they hunt homeless children for sport in brazil...so, human life their isn't worth a shit...or are college students worth more than a homeless child? On the very first day that I was in Rio, back in 92', my cab driver ran over a child and killed him...kept going...I reported him to the police when I arrived at the hotel...the police ended﻿ up arresting me and charging me $15,000 to avoid manslaughter charges...karma is a bitch

Keep your head in the sand. You know what I'm saying is the truth. I don't live in a house...Although I do own a couple. I live on a 61' sloop.(that's a boat, in case you are actually retarded as you seem..) I've spent 10 years sailing up and down the coast of Brazil, one of my current boat guest is from Natal. Where are you from again? Maybe if you left your mommies basement you﻿ would see the reality of your world. Most likely you are a spoiled little shit who's mommy still wipes his ass.

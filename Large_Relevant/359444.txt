NEW ORLEANS (AP) — While a blimp hovers not too far in the distance, circling over tens of thousands of Super Bowl revelers, Christopher Weaver looks around at the neighborhood where he was born and raised and almost died.
He loves this place, probably more now than he did back in 2005, before Hurricane Katrina tried to wash it all away.
But it's not much to look at, that's for sure.
"You can see it for yourself," Weaver moaned to a reporter, staring Friday at all the vacant lots, overrun with weeds that are taller than he is, at all the abandoned shells of former homes, many of them still marked with the spray-painted "X'' that became the grim symbol of a great American city nearly wiped off the map.
"I'm going to be honest with you," he went on. "It sucks here. Just look across the street. Nothing. Look over there. Nothing."
In many ways, New Orleans has come back stronger than ever since Katrina. The restaurant scene is thriving. The hotels are packed. The Superdome has received a glamorous makeover. The French Quarter rocks into the wee hours night after night.
But, as the Big Easy prepares to host the party-slash-national holiday it does like no other, Super Bowl Sunday, it's worth remembering that life has not yet returned to normal for everyone here.
Not even close.
"It's like a tale of two cities," said Mike Miller, who works with the homeless group Unity of Greater New Orleans. "It's hard to believe that seven years later, it still looks like this."
Just a short ride from the French Quarter, in historic neighborhoods such as Treme and the Ninth Ward, it's not hard to find a virtual time capsule from the days when Katrina roared ashore. On block after block, there are structures that look pretty much the same as they did after the water receded.
There are the telltale markings that show just how high it climbed when the levees cracked — 3 feet on this crumbling house, 5 feet on those remains of a shopping mall, 7 feet on that ghostly apartment complex. Those Xs still mark the date many of them were searched, who did the searching and how many bodies, if any, were found inside.
Where kids once played and neighbors used to hang out together, now all that remains could easily pass for a former war zone.
"It's just hard to believe that every abandoned house, every abandoned apartment, represents a family that never came back," Miller said, shaking his head.
Even after all these years, it all looks so familiar to anyone who remembers those horrific images of people clinging to rooftops and huddled on bridges, waiting desperately for help to arrive.
"You can still see," said Travers Kurr, also with Unity of Greater New Orleans, pointing toward the roof of a boarded-up house, "where people busted out of their attics so they could be rescued."
Weaver was one of those who barely got out alive.
When Katrina struck, he was looking out a window toward the levee about a block away, the one that was supposed to keep him safe. Instead, he watched it tear apart right before his eyes — and the water come rushing through.
He tried to escape the conventional way, but the pressure from winds howling at well over 100 mph prevented him from opening the door. He busted a window and climbed out, only to get pinned against the wall of his house by the rapidly rising waters. Finally, he went under, sure he was going to die. He held his breath and remembered what his grandmother told him, to always pray to God to forgive his sins.
"Suddenly, something shot me away from that house," Weaver said, convinced beyond any doubt that he's still alive today only because of a higher power.
A neighbor pulled him to safety using a strand of Christmas lights. After 2½ days on a rooftop, they were finally rescued. Weaver still has a nasty scar of his right leg from a cut he got while being tossed about in the turbulent waters.
Despite the unthinkable carnage in the Lower Ninth Ward, Weaver never had any doubt he would return and rebuild, even if it's now clear that so many of his former neighbors and fellow survivors won't be following his lead.
"I was born and raised right here," he said. "If Katrina comes back again, I'm still not leaving."
Miller estimates there are more than 10,000 — and maybe as many as 15,000 — abandoned structures in the New Orleans metro area. Many of them have been commandeered by the city's large homeless population, who slip away in the light of day but leave behind evidence of their existence — dirty clothes scattered about, a bedroll where they slept, empty cans and plastic foam containers from what passed for a meal.
As he drives around the areas that won't be found in any tourism brochures, another member of his team, New Orleans native Clarence White, rattles off what used to be here, what used to be there.
"That was a popular bar room over there," White said, turning to his left. "There used to be a drug store over there," he said, shifting his gaze to the right.
The NFL, as it now does in all Super Bowl cities, has set aside Saturday as a day of service, in which volunteers will take part in the renovation of five local playgrounds and their surrounding communities. That gesture will surely be more poignant in New Orleans than any other place where the championship game is held.
But Baltimore Ravens safety Ed Reed, a native of nearby St. Rose, is keenly aware that it will take far more than a few hours to get this city — this entire city — back on its feet.
"When I get home, I drive around the city, go to some of my old spots, just hang out with people," he said. "You see the city is rebuilding, but we've still got a long way to go. It's just different, man. You have so many people that were lost. The spirit was kind of broken for a second. But New Orleans people, we've been through a lot. We love our city, man. We love to have a good time. We love for people to come have a great time with us."
Even amid the lingering devastation, there are hopeful signs of progress. In the Lower Ninth Ward, for instance, construction workers were on the scene Friday at several odd-shaped, energy-efficient homes going up with funding from a group led by actor Brad Pitt.
"I appreciate everything he's doing," Weaver said, though he quickly added that the remnants of Katrina are far, far more prevalent in this part of New Orleans.
Through all the hardship, Weaver doesn't seem the least bit bitter about his plight. He's proud the Super Bowl has returned to his hometown for the first time since Katrina, and he'll be pulling hard for the Ravens to beat the San Francisco 49ers. This being New Orleans, the occasion will be marked with adult beverages and plenty of food — gumbo, red beans and rice, a big pot of crawfish.
But, for all those Super Bowl revelers who might think everything has returned to normal in the Big Easy, Weaver has this message:
"Come on over here where I'm at."
It's not far away at all.

After living in N.O. pre-Katrina, I can honestly say that Katrina, outside of the deaths (mostly due to LOCAL lack of preparation) may have been the best thing to happen to that area. The corruption that was rampant in all public sectors, the total apathy among the people, etc. I had thought i had moved to a third-world nation when i had to live there.

Looks like Weaver will have to find someplace else to "keep it real."

It's true that some areas of NOLA will never be rebuilt, but the people of the city have regained their joie d'vivre. It was a privilege to live there for 4 years post-The Storm (that's what they call it) & be witness to that. I love the city & still miss it.

FACTS.  Treme' and Nith Ward  are  not significant and the people there suffered no more  than the many  other areas  hit. FACT-The poor are  back and Black and better than ever. The rich  of  the  friends/families  of Eli and Cooper  Manning, the uptown WASP  crowd  were not hit. Higher land.
The Middel -Class Whites and Blacks,  were hit. Some  had  to leave, cannot return.  Others  are  still  there to say they  are there and struggling.  Others are  ok  with their  jobs and fam/friends.
The Midle-Class  suffered and still are. White and  Black Middle-Class.

New Orleans has bounced back specifically because those areas were left to rot.

This story, sad to say, is quite accurate. But it fails to really express just how horrible things really are... You have got to see it to really believe it. Seven Years after Katrina, the city of New Orleans remains horribly broken and an economic mess. Its economy so damaged that one-third of the city's streetlights don't work. In the darkness, crime runs rampant, thugs are everywhere. Except for special occasions such as the Super Bowl, and when major conventions are in town, the city is empty, the thoroughfares lacking any real sense of commerce. The Big Easy is better described as The Big Empty. Except for those that cater to the tourist trade, businesses struggle in an economy where there are few good jobs and the work force is poorly educated and have few dollars to spend. What money comes to the city leaves via the many corporations that run the major hotels and the City's main casino, Harrah's. Mayor Nagin, recently indicted and soon to be convicted of fraud and bribery, failed to provide the leadership needed to achieve recovery; he, more than anyone else is to blame, and can easily be judged the worst mayor in the city's history. Over the weekend, with the national spotlight on New Orleans, the city will put on its best face, but the truth is... This is no place any clear thinking person would wish to live and raise a family. Let's hope  that someday it's a different story.

This article is the very way I felt about 6 years ago. There were 10 of us in all. We rented an r.v. drove from NYC-New Orleans. We helped build houses, cleaned out and started repairing/rebuilding schools in the lower 9th. I really feel that our country failed New Orleans tremendously. After the complete battering done by Katrina, people helped, created documentaries in which I hoped intended to bring attention to these residents despair and tremendous loss. After the "hip" window of time passed to help these people, it was on to the next disaster/news maker. But we failed and we failed epically. This country started a job and didn't finish it.

This article is so spot on as far as how eery it is to drive through a place that has trees growing out of dilapidated abandoned schools, churches and buildings. To see the X's with the # of deceased M and/or F victims. To walk through an abandoned school that reminds me of a set for some horror/supernatural film reminds me that we indeed failed the people of New Orleans. As the Lower 9th seemed like a ghost town and our new friends told us that unlike most, they "stayed behind" because Orleans was/is their home and believe it or not the neighborhood they remained loyal to is like post apocalyptic(as author states above.) Yes, the politics down there are crooked, yes the people still need help, yes the hearts and determination of the people we met overly impressed me...BUT, no this country failed to give that city the resources and support they needed. I'll never understand why the U.S government goes and fights others battles, sacrifices our tax money to help people who burn our flag and risk the lives of our heroic men & women when we should work together as a country and society to better the situations in our own back yards, ....smh

Merry Christmas? Pope Benedict XVI Denounces Gay Marriage As A ‘Manipulation Of Nature’

Pope Benedict XVI used the opportunity of his annual Christmas address to amp up his opposition to gay marriage Friday, calling homosexuality a “manipulation of nature.” He denounced people who “deny their nature” and “make it for themselves.” He claimed homosexuality was destroying the very “essence of the human creature.”
The Pope dedicated the speech to promoting “traditional family values” in the wake of campaigns to legalize same-sex marriage in France, the United States, Great Britain and elsewhere. He implied that the Vatican would be open to allying itself with other faiths who also oppose marriage equality.
During the speech, he referred to a study done by the Chief Rabbi of France, Gilles Bernheim, who called the campaign for marriage equality an “attack” on the traditional family. The Pope agreed, saying,
“There is no denying the crisis that threatens it [the family] to its foundations – especially in the Western world. When such commitment is repudiated, the key figures of human existence likewise vanish: father, mother, child – essential elements of the experience of being human are lost.”
Earlier that same week, the Pope said gay marriage, along with abortion, was a threat to world peace. 
Franco Grillini, a spokesman for the gay community in Italy, said the Pope’s speech was “great foolishness.” Grillini noted, “Where gay marriage has been approved, there has been no consequence on heterosexual marriage.”

Tell you what Pope Benedict XVI you and your clergy stop protecting child rapists maybe you can have a word on family values.






Sven Johannson



the Pope ? this Pope ? there used 2 b a saying if in the affirmative .. you’d answer is the Pope Catholic?   of course …  now it should forever be   ” did the Pope Hide Pedophiles?”   of course..  so this Pope needs to shut the hell up about things he knows nothing about and contraceptive being another just STHU .. or ask one of his many gay Priests they might actually teach him something about the nurture vs nature thing

They really need to start nominating Popes based on charisma.
This one just isn’t as lovable as the last one.

I just passed a catholic church in the city, on my way home, and there were lines all the way around the church, full of less fortunate people collecting food and gifts for their families. Most people looked pretty happy the church was helping them out.

Given the fact that there is documented evidence of homosexuality in nature, it seems  Benedict is questioning Gods work
And, if we really want use the nature argument, one could argue marriage is a manipulation of nature since many species do not mate for life

So-called “gay marriage” is certainly the hallmark of a decadent & depraved society. Praise Pope Benedict XVI for defending the Faith.

To be fair, Benedict himself hasn’t molested anybody. He just makes sure the other guys can keep on molesting kids.

God bless Pope Benedict! He is right. First they deny God, then they deny nature itself. No good can come from a movement that denies objective truth and reality that can be seen in nature itself.

Unlike pedophilia priests and those who covered for them. Unlike forced celibacy. Unlike denying women their rightful equality. And happy holidays to you, Benedict.

A child is more likely to be abused by a public school teacher than by a Catholic priest, and teacher unions have protected abusers, but no one is saying this means public education is an evil institution. Corruption exists because we live in a fallen world, and the only reason fingers are pointed at the Catholic Church is because we hold religious leaders to a higher standard. That is all well and good, but do not fool yourselves into believing that the one institution that is the oldest still standing that has pronounced the dignity of all human beings for two millennia is corrupt because it has some corrupt members. Catholicism is good. So is public education. Individuals, however, often fail.

It’s clear the real hatred is directed at the Church. One need look no further than many of  the comments on this thread.

Why would you and the other homosexuals be upset at raping children?  Its part of the Official 1972 Gay Rights Agenda that was adopted in Chicago in 1972.  Maybe you’re upset that priests don’t marry and the Gay Rights Agenda is to have state sanctioned polygamy?  (Items 7 and 8 of the STATE LEVEL, below.)
Of course, we know that since “After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the90′s ” was published back in ’89, you had to put your support for the North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) in the background as it would hurt you in obtaining the lower hanging fruit of your agenda, but – hey – we know what’s ultimately on your mind.  (I mean, that IS why you guys are pressuring the Boy Scouts to admit homosexual scout leaders, right? I mean, there are scores of ADULT male membership societies that prohibit homosexual members – why no fight with them if not that you prefer teenage boys, right?)
Here’s the full agenda.  
http://www.rslevinson.com/gaylesissues/features/collect/onetime/bl_platform1972.htm
The 1972 Gay Rights Platform
Platform created at the National Coalition of Gay Organizations Convention held in Chicago in 1972
 FEDERAL LEVEL:
1. Amend all federal Civil Rights Acts, other legislation and government controls to prohibit discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations and public services.
2. Issuance by the President of an executive order prohibiting the military from excluding for reasons of their sexual orientation, persons who of their own volition desire entrance into the Armed Services; and from issuing less-than-fully-honorable discharges for homosexuality; and the upgrading to fully honorable all such discharges previously issued, with retroactive benefits.
3. Issuance by the President of an executive order prohibiting discrimination in the federal civil service because of sexual orientation, in hiring and promoting; and prohibiting discriminations against homosexuals in security clearances.
4. Elimination of tax inequities victimizing single persons and same-sex couples.
5. Elimination of bars to the entry, immigration and naturalization of homosexual aliens.
 6. Federal encouragement and support for sex education courses, prepared and taught by gay women and men, presenting homosexuality as a valid, healthy preference and lifestyle as a viable alternative to heterosexuality.
7. Appropriate executive orders, regulations and legislation banning the compiling, maintenance and dissemination of information on an individual’s sexual preferences, behavior, and social and political activities for dossiers and data banks.
8. Federal funding of aid programs of gay men’s and women’s organizations designed to alleviate the problems encountered by Gay women and men which are engendered by an oppressive sexist society.
9. Immediate release of all Gay women and men now incarcerated in detention centers, prisons and mental institutions because of sexual offense charges relating to victimless crimes or sexual orientation; and that adequate compensation be made for the physical and mental duress encountered; and that all existing records relating to the incarceration be immediately expunged.
STATE LEVEL:
1. All federal legislation and programs enumerated in Demands 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9 above should be implemented at the State level where applicable.
2. Repeal of all state laws prohibiting private sexual acts involving consenting persons; equalization for homosexuals and heterosexuals for the enforcement of all laws.
3. Repeal all state laws prohibiting solicitation for private voluntary sexual liaisons; and laws prohibiting prostitution, both male and female.
4. Enactment of legislation prohibiting insurance companies and any other state-regulated enterprises from discriminating because of sexual orientation, in insurance and in bonding or any other prerequisite to employment or control of one’s personal demesne.
5. Enactment of legislation so that child custody, adoption, visitation rights, foster parenting, and the like shall not be denied because of sexual orientation or marital status.
6. Repeal of all state laws prohibiting transvestism and cross-dressing.
7. Repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent.
8. Repeal of all legislative provisions that restrict the sex or number of persons entering into a marriage unit; and the extension of legal benefits to all persons who cohabit regardless of sex or numbers.

As a Catholic, I will say many of the posts are certainly mean spirited. But in no way are they inaccurate. I am very disappointed in this Pope. He lost me when he scolded “the Nuns on the Bus.”

Then leave the church, though I doubt you’ve see the inside of one anytime in the last 10 years..

The Gay Lobby went after these despicable “priests”(sic) because they knew the Church’s “wealth” at the parish level lays  mostly in real estate.  If they could get big settlements with the churches, they could close Catholic schools and Catholic churches so as to torpedo the promulgation of the faith.  The fact that it pushed more struggling families closer into the hands — and control — of the government was just a side benefit.

And why would I leave the church? Because I disagree? You are a moron. Do realize how much the church has changed since 1950 due to societal norms? You must be a fundamentalist in the vain of wing nuts like Paul Ryan and Rick Santorum. Have you agreed with everything in the church?

Also a “manipulation of nature”? Institutional celibacy (or the pretense of celibacy) with very dark results.

    http://twitter.com/uBrute                            Bruce Scherer



Statistics, or GTFO. There are more than 4 million teachers, doubtful there have been thousands of rapists among them deliberately reassigned to rape kids in other posts, as has happened for generations internationally in the Catholic Church. Public schools have mandatory reporting and are beholden to terrestrial law. Priests think they have magical powers and only respond to other fake wizards.

TLDR






    http://www.lisagraas.com                            Lisa Graas



The following was reported by CBS News, September 22, 2009, so you’re several years behind on the facts, Mr. Scherer —  Consider the statistics: In accordance with a requirement of President
Bush’s No Child Left Behind Act, in 2002 the Department of Education
carried out a study of sexual abuse in the school system. Hofstra
 University researcher Charol Shakeshaft looked into the problem, and
the first thing that came to her mind when Education Week reported on
the study were the daily headlines about the Catholic Church. “[T]hink
 the Catholic Church has a problem?” she said. “The physical sexual
abuse of students in schools is likely more than 100 times the abuse by
priests.”

Ultimately, the RCC went after the RCC, and they did a darn good job of cleaning things up. Even so, as previously noted, our public schools are about 100 times more dangerous to kids  (re: pedophilia) than the Catholic Church is.






Esteban Rey



The forced conversion of millions (and murder of those who did not convert) in Latin America is a matter of fact, it cannot be denied.
The Inquisition is also a matter of fact, it cannot be denied.
The crusades…also a matter of fact, cannot be denied.






Esteban Rey



Hey you sound just like Mullah Omar and Mahmoud Amadinejiad!
Hateful lunatic.






    http://www.lisagraas.com                            Lisa Graas



I hate sin. So does Jesus. Sodomy is one of the four sins so horrible that it cries to heaven for justice. Do you know what nailed Jesus to the Cross? Sin, that’s what.






Esteban Rey



Do you realize that your church sanctioned the murder of millions of Jews, and your Rat Pope reintroduced the antisemitic Latin Mass?
My Jewish grandmother escaped murderous catholics like yourself in 1938.






Esteban Rey



It’s a curse word.  It can be very appropriately used when referring to sickening, evil people.






Esteban Rey



What did Jesus say about homosexuality?
Let he who is without sin, yada yada yada.  Do unto others yada yada yada.






    http://www.lisagraas.com                            Lisa Graas



You forget one teeny tiny difference. For Catholics, murder is a sin, too. Not so in Islam.






    http://www.lisagraas.com                            Lisa Graas



Sir Martin Gilbert, one of my FAVORITE authors, and a Jewish Holocaust historian, would strongly disagree with you on that. Also, I think your calling Pope Benedict “Rat Pope” sounds vaguely reminiscent of Nazi propaganda against Jews. Just sayin’…..

The Inquisition was a tool of the Spanish monarchy, kind of like any bishop who might side with Obama on the HHS mandate would be. Fortunately, none of our bishops are doing that. The Crusades were defensive wars begun because Islamists were slaughtering innocent pilgrims to the Holy Land because said pilgrims would not convert to Islam. Again, it is Islam that believes in forced conversion.

So he was a member of the Hitler Jugend, the claim is entirely accurate.
We are extremely disappointed and deeply offended that nearly 40 years after the Vatican rightly removed insulting anti-Jewish language from the Good Friday liturgy, that it would now permit Catholics to utter such hurtful and insulting words by praying for Jews to be converted.  This is a
theological setback in the religious life of Catholics and a body blow
to Catholic-Jewish relations.  It is the wrong decision at the wrong
time.
It appears the Vatican has chosen to satisfy a right-wing faction in the Church that rejects change and reconciliation.

The crusades were defensive wars?  Then why did they invade Jerusalem with foreign armies and slaughter all of its inhabitants?  That’s some defense!
The church was very happy with forced conversions under pain of torture.
While many people associate the Inquisition with Spain and Portugal, it was actually instituted by Pope Innocent III (1198-1216) in Rome. A later pope, Pope Gregory IX established the Inquisition, in 1233, to combat the heresy of the Abilgenses, a religious sect in France.

As for the Inquisition, the Inquisition never ended.

Corrupt individuals do not mean the institution is corrupt.

To the contrary, “gay marriage” does everyone harm. It is a claim that the relationship in marriage between one man and one woman is not an inherently good thing, better than other relationships. That harms the whole of society because it robs children of having both a mom and a dad.

Chamberlain was a conservative like yourself.  
I actually don’t have a problem with Catholics, believe it or not. Liberation theology is great stuff.  Don’t particularly love the Vatican, a monument to greed that would be an abomination in the eyes of Christ.

There is no such claim.  Gay marriage is a legal concept that makes good on the promise of the 14th amendment.  This is America.  All people are entitled to the same legal rights.

Yes, there is such a claim. We can promote something as being better than other things, or not. We’ve always promoted, as a country, that marriage between one man and one woman is better than other relationships, the best for society. “Gay marriage” destroys that concept entirely. Divorce is bad but it does not “rob” children of having both a mom and a dad. Children of divorced parents have a right to a relationship with both their mother and their father, in our courts, but when “gay marriage” comes, that right of children disappears as children are being considered to be the “right” of “gay couples” to have rather than children having the right to a mom and dad.






Esteban Rey



It’s a sin that many Catholics have been happy to commit, repeatedly, against Jews and gay people alike.  Anti-gay hate speech like yours encourages these murderers.






Someguy



Clearly you do not either.






Esteban Rey



Nah, you didn’t.  I can certainly tolerate the fact that you disagree, but the facts aren’t in dispute.  The Rat Pope did reintroduce the antisemitic mass.  The Church has sanctioned the murder of millions.  These are both indisputable facts.
Keep your religious fanaticism far, far away from my secular constitutional republic.






Esteban Rey



The whole of Scripture is the “Word” of Jesus.
Before or after it was edited by the Roman Emperor Constantine at the council of Nicea?






Esteban Rey



Right.  The church condemned Liberation theology because it was too near the actual teachings of Jesus Christ.  Can’t have that, actually following the teachings of Jesus would be dangerous.  Much better to focus on hating gay people.
But the church presumably does not condemn the “holy father’s” residence in a gold plated monument to greed.






Esteban Rey



This country has also promoted other great evils, like slavery, segregation and genocide.  Your desire to  enshrine your personal and pathetic hatred of gay people into law fits in alongside these other evils.  
Moreover, your insistence that one kind of relationship be elevated above another is an excellent example of the sin of pride, a desire to have your own beliefs elevated above all others.  Kinda seems like you have a lot of confessing to do. 
Jesus said nothing whatsoever about homosexuality, but his opinions on divorce are very clear.
And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.”
I don’t see any “divorce is bad…but” in that message.  Cafeteria catholic much?

Actually, one NYC school teacher — for over 30 YEARS — was outed as a pedophile in 1993 and could only be fired — seven YEARS later — after the City went through the arduous and costly process of dismissing a tenured teacher.  THEN, the guy had the gall to sue the City for firing him, which took another three years and tens of thousands of dollars of legal bills.
So, of COURSE NYC schools harbor and protect pedophiles.  Like others who abuse the system, it is way too much trouble to fire them..  (Which is why the homosexuals in NAMBLA drew out this case as long as they did — to set an example for NYC school administrators: if you try to stop them from exercising their disgusting perversions, you’ll have more trouble than they do.
in all the 10 years of litigation, nobody in the NYC school board ever bothered to even ask the guy who the other members of his NAMBLA cell  were.  Frankly, I would have simply TOS’d the miserable MF’er.

No.  She’s saying that the Homosexual Lobby and the Left have exaggerated the Church’s crimes relative to other extant crimes as a means to assault and vilify the RC Church because it is one of the few institutions with the fortitude to oppose the criminal propaganda machine of the homosexual “rights” (sic) movement, which — in its own records, statements, and leadership — advocates sex with children and polygamy.

Actually, the 2% or so of the homosexual population is responsible for at least 30% of all reported child molestation, and probably far more because boys tend to keep such episodes to themselves out of shame.  So, while its true that “most pedophiles are straight white men” who are responsible for 60% of molestations, most of the remaining REPORTED 40% is male-on-male abuse.
That’s a staggering level of abuse for only 2% of the population.  
So, your children are at far greater risk of molestation in private time with a homosexual than they are with a “straight white man.”

I am saying that the attempt to paint the Catholic Church as a corrupt institution is both a farce and hypocritical given that the problem has been found to be 100 times worse in the public school system. Catholicism has OFFICIAL teaching on sin, and pedophilia is a sin, and so is putting children in danger. Both are sins, and all who sin separate themselves from the Church through sin. So to claim that “the Church” sinned is preposterous and wrong. It would also be wrong to claim public education is bad because pedophilia is so rampant in our public schools. Pedophilia is what is bad, not public education and not Catholicism. The idea that is being pushed here is that the Church has no moral authority because some priests and bishops disobeyed the clear teaching of the Church. It’s illogical and it’s a campaign of hatred against the Church.

Please list your “hierarchy of sins”, I’ve never heard of them. 
I’ve only known of Sins…All people have sinned, are sinning, and shall sin until the day they die. 
The reason I say that is because we are all people and are not perfect {If you are a Christian, only one person has not sinned}
You are aware of the fact Sodom & Gomorrah were not destroyed because they were filled with homosexuals. If there had been gay people there the family would have been welcomed. Lot’s son-in-laws would have been going about with them. Since after their destruction Lot’s son-in-law actually commits what you think is Sodomy. Please read Ezekiel for the reason for their destruction…Hint basically they have become like today’s Republican, Tea Partiers, and neo-cons. They don’t give a damn about others.
Would like your rankings,,
Married Couples that had premarital sex numerous times.
Cohabiting couples that are having sex numerous times (since they aren’t married) they will be committing sin almost perpetually.
A gay couple that has made a commitment to their other that they would not have sex with anyone other than he. And what would happen when this couple decides to have their relationship approved by a Church maybe not your Catholic Church but a Protestant Denomination. 
That same couple as they go around and feed the hungry and clothe the needy to the extent that they are financially able.
Vs.
A married couple that has anal sex (hint-this is sodomy) 
A married couple that uses contraception such as wearing a condom, IUD’s, females with Mirena, uses Spermicide, Sponge, Diaphragm, the Pill, an implant, NuvaRing, Norplant (available in Mexico or Canada, or the guy pulling out and shooting his load all over the woman.
*Note the guy withdrawing was a sin in the OT. God even killed one guy for doing it..he didn’t want more children.
Also tell me where murder, pre-marital sex. adultery, and all the others.
Please note…For some reason God’s Big Ten doesn’t say anything about homosexuals at all. As far as Paul’s mentioning it…It’s widely known in the scholarly community that Paul was a self-hating homosexual.

Don’t tell me that you don’t sin daily.
●When you drive on the freeway at 67 mph when the speed limit was 65. That’s a sin.
●When you are asked by a friend do they look great/good in a new dress, when it actually looks atrocious. And you don’t tell them that it looks horrible.
●When you eat a hamburger and drink a milkshake. *Abomination
●When you were two different fabrics or something that is a mix like a cotton-poly blend. *Abomination
●When you sit down with your husband on a Sunday after church and watch football. *Abomination-you are making someone work on the Sabbath.
●When you eat Pork.
600+ more abominations. Still I don’t find a hierarchy of sins. If I speed on the freeway that is a sin, just as much a sin as having gay sex would bee. 
Jesus said rend unto Caesar what is Caesar’s. Means we must obey the laws of our State and Nation.

In Islam in many nations to get a divorce a man just needs to say “I divorce thee 3 times where someone else hears it. Then they are divorced.

Lisa, the Pope expressed solidarity with Islam and any other organized religions that condemn gay couples. I would also point out that you have sinned many times during this discourse (according to your Church). Debate is a sin (Romans 1:29).  Mocking is a sin (Jude 18). Preaching with foolishness (i.e. joking) is a sin (Eph. 5:4). Thinking yourself righteous is a sin (Mk 2:17). Scoffing is a sin (2 Pe 3:3).
But I don’t believe in any of this dogma. Pointing to the school system, whatever its flaws, doesn’t raise the moral authority of YOUR church. Your church has no moral authority. You are free to claim otherwise. Your claims are meaningless, because they presuppose that Church dogma is sacrosanct. It isn’t. Harming children is wrong, and no one needs your church to tell me that. Love is good, and no one needs your church to define Love.
Have a nice day.

no jack hole… Hitler DID meet with the Pope, who DID know what was happening to the Jews.
back in the 1860′s the Pope actually rounded up the Jewish population of Rome and ran them through the street in an act of terrorism on Christmas as a way to punish them for Jesus’s death.
you obviously haven’t a clue about Catholicism… or Jesus for that matter.
As part of the Saturnalia carnival throughout the 18th
and 19th centuries CE, rabbis of the ghetto in Rome were
forced to wear clownish outfits and march through the city streets to the jeers
of the crowd, pelted by a variety of missiles. When the Jewish community of Rome
sent a petition in1836 to Pope Gregory XVI begging him to stop the annual
Saturnalia abuse of the Jewish community, he responded, “It is not opportune to
make any innovation.”[6]
On December 25, 1881, Christian leaders whipped the Polish masses into
Antisemitic frenzies that led to riots across the country.  In Warsaw 12 Jews
were brutally murdered, huge numbers maimed, and many Jewish women were raped.
Two million rubles worth of property was destroyed.

wrong!  Here is the new testament and the teachings of Jesus;
“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You
give a tenth of your spices–mint, dill and cummin. But you have
neglected the more important matters of the law–justice, mercy and
faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting
the former. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel” (Matthew 23: 23 – 24).
“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?”  (Matthew 7:3)
1 John 1:7 tells us “The blood of Jesus purifies us from every sin” (1 John 1:7).

That’s only true in terms of absolute numbers.  in percentage terms, the 2% to 3% of the homosexual population is responsible for at LEAST 30% of all child molestations, and likely far more because boys are most reluctant to report the abuse.
So, homosexuals are far more likely to be child molesters than straight people; its part of why they are so dangerous to employ as school teachers, pediatric health professionals, etc.   What’s more, the homosexual political manifesto setting forth the “Gay ‘Rights’” Agenda’ that was adopted in Chicago in 1972 said that homosexuals wanted to eliminate ANY “age of consent” laws (so that homosexuals could have sex with children of ANY age) to adopt polygamy as a matter of course in “marriages”.
Don’t buy into the homosexual propaganda campaign.  “Gay ‘Rights’” activists are engaged in a dangerous, criminal, conspiracy.  They need to be stopped.

Hitler had Rohm executed because he thought Rohm was involved in a coup against him.  Rohm was given the option of committing suicide, unlike the other co-conspirators who were summarily executed.
Besides, homosexual men kill their lovers at a staggeringly disproportionate rate, relative to their population and also are known for the vicious dismemberment as killing.  Its all part of the mental disorder that homosexuals so actively deny.

Yet another demonstrable lie by the gay lobby, along with ‘homosexuals are born that way; its not a choice.” (Were the latter the case, there would be so so-called “bi-sexual” (sic) men nor would there be men with children who “come out” at a later age.
What has been observed is dominance behavior, not “mating”. A  male dog will attempt to mount another dog, for example, but there is no penile penetration of the anus.  Its simply dogs determining who’s boss. of the pack.
If the Homosexual Lobby propaganda lie were true, and “homosexuality” were observed in species, then you’d see LESBIAN behavior in dogs, no?  Who has ever seen that among female dogs?
its more of the homosexual propaganda campaign trying to “normalize” a deeply disturbing mental disorder.  its like trying to say that people who curse when they hit their finger with a hammer are “talking to themselves” and “swearing at nobody in particular”; therefore, raving schizophrenics are “normal”.

Just another excuse by Dan Abrams to call out the LefTard hate brigades to boost his page views when soliciting advertising dollars from companies.
Abrams likes to bring out the homosexual and anti-Catholic hate brigades whenever his page views start to drop.  Now that Mitt Romney has gone away, he has to find another target for the idiot LibTard fascists that populate his site to demonize and attack.
With luck, Wayne LaPierre might  give Abrams’ and his LefTard minions down in SoHo another target.
Abrams just likes to rouse the LefTard masses to spew their vile filth and hatred here; its good for his bank account.  Just think of Abrams as running a kind of skinhead, hate-monger site for LefTards..  I’m sure he pays certain posters here to gin up the hater-aide so that LefTards don’t feel inhibited in spewing their vile filth.

This is true but I think the main problem is that it shouldn’t be a legal problem.  I don’t think it hurts the teenage boy.  The teacher shouldn’t be doing it.  She should be fired but I don’t believe she should be jailed.  In China in the old days, my father-in-law’s days, to be exact, it was not uncommon for a 14 year old boy to be married.  My husband’s father was married at this age to a girl who was 18 and he lived a long, happy life, earned an architectural degree, became a millionaire and had 7 children.  It did not mess up his life in any way.

A male who has sex with another male is by definition “homosexual.  If the attraction were EXCLUSIVELY to children, I might have taken your point.  But NAMBLA?  North American MAN-BOY Love Association?  The preponderance of male-on-male sex abuse?  The aim now of the “Gay ‘Rights’” lobby to force their way into the BOY  Scouts (when most other ADULT men’s private membership associations — Elks, KofC, Moose, etc — also prohibit homosexuals but receive no pressure to open their ranks?
Look, NAMBLA and the other (mostly male) pedophiles in the “Gay ‘Rights’” movement exposed themselves 40 years ago in Chicago when they said they wanted to do away with ANY “age of consent” laws.  The the whole “Gay Rights” movement was FOUNDED by a pedophile, Harry Hay.
The mere fact that the “Gay ‘Rights’” lobby moved their goal of child molestation to the back burner while they conned the public into achieving their goals that were lower hanging fruit doesn’t mean that homosexual activists are not pedophiles.  They are.  That’s why they need to be stopped, arrested, and imprisoned.

Nambla is not a gay rights lobby, but merely a collection of criminals and perves.  Stop bringing up some stupid sh$t from 1970 or some fringe group like that, it is laughably stupid.  
Calling a pedo that preys on boys a gay is as silly as calling one that preys on girls “straight”.  There is nothing straight about it is there?  It is perverted and wrong to see little kids in that way, and no one serious refers to that kind of attraction in the way you characterize it.
You think gay sex is as gross as pedophilia, I get that.  Psychiatrists don’t agree, and do not define predators with same terms as consenting adults.  You know that, which is why you rant about some stupid s#$t from 1970s and distract with other silliness

NAMBLA is STILL part of the “Gay ‘Rights’” movement.  They marched openly in their parades until 1993.  You’re in denial.  The only reason you don’t see them out front any more is that the PR types (See “After the Ball”) said that the strategy of playing “the victim” to any political opponents was curtailed if the pedophiles were visible out in front of the Gay Lobby.because they are not the type of sympathetic character homosexuals wanted to present to the public.
A big reason that “Gay ‘Rights’” group want same-gender marriage is so that old homosexuals can pass on their wealth to the young chicken hawk 20-somethings with whom they are involved without paying the estate tax.  They do guys 18,19, 20 years old on a “relationship” basis because they’re legal age.  But when they’re cruising for short-term company over on 12th Avenue here in NYC, they’ll pay for a young teen runaway.
When I was in the Philippines, there were American homosexuals arriving by the planeload looking to prey on young Filipino street kids, 8 to maybe 16.  This was under Marcos and the local authorities averted their eyes and were happy for the business at their hotels and restaurants.
They’re sick people; I think you know that even if your LibTard reflexes say they’re a protected class.  And look into that 1972 decision to remove homosexuality from the list of sexual paraphilia.  You’ll find that a good number of the board of the APA at the time were THEMSELVES closeted homosexuals who had steered the conference where the decision was made to San Francisco, where local homosexual radicals VIOLENTLY upset the whole process.  The APA membership said, “Screw it…they’re only hurting each other” and conceded removed homosexuality from the DSM.  That doesn’t quite make the case for “normal” now, does it?

You saw a pedophile messing with kids in the Philippines and saw a parade 20 years ago.  Those are your smoking guns?

Ah, he started back THAT long ago.  It’s no wonder it took them so long to get rid of him.  I grew up in the late 50s and the 60s weren’t really much different.  Children were taught to be seen and not heard.  Naturally that meant we were NEVER believed.  I had a cousin who was molested by a relative; did anyone believe her?  Naturally not.  She was just a little girl and no one really paid attention to anything little girls said, especially if it was anything BAD about male relatives.  Even if a male relative had murdered them, people would have been likely to have sworn up and down that it was a ‘stranger’.

This started, I believe you said, in 1968, right?  I’m not surprised it took so long then.  It took a long time for our patriarchal society to wake up and realize that when accusations were made against adult males that they were REAL!!!  I’m not really surprised that it took as long as the 90s for anything to be done.  We, as a society, are very slow to admit to men doing anything wrong in the sexual arena.  Look how difficult it is for a woman to bring a rape verdict in even now if the man has any kind of social standing at all.  Only think how difficult this sort of thing would have been back then.

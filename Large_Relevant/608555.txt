Guys, Satan is﻿ here identified. According to Bible, if Satan shows up then Christ will follow, and END is closing in. This is the greatest news on earth. Everybody please don't be scared, instead please be happy.

So wait this just got uploaded about 30 minutes ago and it already has 316,559 views that's odd, I'm not saying this because I think the song nor the vid suck not at all I love The Flaming Lips, I just find it odd because their channel doesn't even have 10,000 subs and the Youtube view counter﻿ always stops at 300 something views as it updates the next day or couple of days...

If you scroll down you'll see the that all the comments, except for a few, are from﻿ 4 years ago. The video was probably made private 4 years ago and just now made public again, giving it the new upload date but not resetting the number of views.

Yes, but is britney spears who have all the money to do things with escenografy,﻿ effects, make up, and she is awful, thats how the world works. But i think that flaming lips should work to do something great (i dont think they are poor, so, but its also true that they have a tremendous imaginary, to the point that to make it video, they must have a Big prodution, and thats a lot of money) i like "yeahx3 song" video, is just a good idea. but others not so well videos have a good trashy pop style

Yeah that's pretty true,having just looked at my comment even I was annoyed by it. I'm not bragging about the experience,there's nothing to brag about,but you were quite﻿ right to pull me up on it. I can't believe I used the word crazy.
The Flaming Lips still deserve massive kudos for creating a great video for a great song though.

The pipe tuneat the end is a March called "Cabar Feidh"! I couldnt beleive when i heard it. I love this band and missed that. I wonder where they got the sound from, if it was found sound or if they arranged for it to be recorded. Either way it doesnt sound well played, but kudos for﻿ effort!

I love how Wayne looks at the camera when he sings "that everyone you know someday will die", just smiling, like saying "everything will be alright", instead of put a sad face.
Cause in every song of Flaming lips there's magic and joy in the air, i have this belief, that﻿ we live in an ordinary world, created upon a magically infinite life. And Flaming Lips brings that to us, so we could breathe... :>

The Elephant, Hindu Ganesha: widely revered as the Remover of Obstacles and more﻿ generally as Lord of Beginnings, patron of arts and sciences, and the diety of intellect and wisdom.
SO much symbolism in this video on top of a universal message all humans can take to heart.

using elephants in music videos/for entertainment is whack.
elephants in captivity aren't able to roam miles of land or create complex social bonds with their own species they way they would in the wild.
not a natural or happy life at all.
love this song, seeing the elephant in the video just makes me sad. humans have awesome﻿ technology but still use other beings as our slaves.

why can't he play the song during the filming? Just play the album version in the background while filming and make an effort to replicate what it looks like to play the song. It raises suspicion in my mind that he can't even play the song, and it really distracts me. I liked the song a lot more before seeing this. I don't like the﻿ shit-eating grin on his face either. I do like the big thumbs-up at the end though. Classy. Almost reminds me of a Volkswagen commercial.

What's so special with this band? they look pretty much like a﻿ standard rock band to me. Even with their efforts to innovate in sound and music.
Is their success because of their weird good-guys pose? Or their lyrics? Because I can't see the innovation. I'm sorry.

That's right there are bands which are﻿ part of some kind of fashion, "the materialistic consumer fashion" and I'm sure a lot of people is aware of that.
But the thing that bothers me is that Flaming Lips is part of another kind of fashion too.
that awful obsession for childish elements like fur animals, teletubbies, etc.
That is called "regression". Back to a time where everything was OK, turns people into children instead of fighting.

I don't know if you remember being a child but myself as a child and most children I know don't put up with any shit they cause it. and materialism﻿ and consumerism are very different. materialism means only things that can be experienced by the 5 senses are real. consumerism is what drives the economy "buy things you don't need"and "more is better" . The animal costumes are just part of their weirdness to try and stand out. also most of their fans use a lot of drugs.

for some reason, it seems to﻿ me, that he's singing about girls who dont think highly of themselves (streetwalkers, belemics etc...)
no idea why it makes me think about that, but it does.
what does it make you think of?

I've just been reading the comments and I am amazed that people dislike the video!
In my opinion it fits the song and the lips perfectly. The blue light on the elephant and wayne, the rabbit head on the bed, and﻿ the drum beat mixed with the quick editing are superb. Great video!

it's not meant to be morbid, it's looking at the beauty in life and appreciating your time here.﻿ at least that's how i interpret it..

I've just realized how similar this song is to Steve Burns' "Troposphere". Which is weird considering Steve's band consists of at least one Flaming Lips member.﻿

Atheism﻿ is not a religion. By definition it is a state of lack of belief or faith in a deity or god. A religion needs faith in something, athiests don't have faith.

of course they don't have religion - but that doesn't mean they have no awareness﻿ or fear of death, nor that they don't attempt to avoid it if they can.
besides, why is it better that they don't have religion? Animals lives tend to be nasty, brutish and short...

im sorry, but i get the impression that you draw a similarity that religion is NOT "nasty, brutish". have you read any history?﻿ Have you read how - at the orders of the Catholic Church - tens of thousands of people were murdered during the middle ages? generally, animals live to exist. they eat, sleep, poop, play and procreate. they dont have preconceived notions, express hatred or bias like humans do. sometimes less really is more.

actually﻿ I have - I'm also aware that humans are capable of brutality. Are you aware that religions are often persecuted by non-religious people? - that millions (not tens of thousands) of Jewish people were killed in the HOlocaust - because they were Jewish (which is a religion)?
Animals also kill on a regular basis just like humans do. They have plenty of biases - possibly you just don't recognize them because they aren't spoken in the form of "English" or human language.

The Holocaust wasn't really over the Jewish religion as much as it was over racism.﻿ If no one was religious most problems would be eliminated. No getting around that.

but your own response here makes a distinction between religion and racism as far as the Holocaust - so if you eliminate religion...there's still racism? which can create Holocausts? - which means problems still exist without "religious" people?
Just suggesting that religion isn't the only cause of "problems" in the world -
(And "Jewishness" is a both﻿ a religion and an ethnicity - so distinguishing between race and religion in that instance is difficult...)

Of course there is still racism. I didn't say that ALL problems would be solved. I said a lot of them would. They hated "the Jews" as in anyone from a certain descent. The Nazis wouldn't have cared if they were﻿ orthodox Jews or not. Not saying that religion had NOTHING to do with it, but Hitler blamed a lot of problems on them, and I doubt it had as much to do with where they worship than their business practices. He was hateful and horrible, no doubt about it.

Well, I disagree. Much conflict has arisen because of various and conflicting religions,﻿ I don't deny that. But does that conflict make the beliefs wrong? Let's say 2 people were fighting over money. To end the conflict, should we just get rid of the money supply?

First you say that it wasn't over religion, but racism,﻿ then you say that religion is the cause of most problems. What point are you making exactly? That the Jewish holocaust is the fault of the Jews? You have two separate thoughts here, both seem contradictory, you should have added a "but" in between your first two sentences. It sounds like double talk so you can blame the holocaust on the Jews. Besides, if no one was religious, they would all follow the atheist religion in your perfect view.

Did you misunderstand me that bad, Or are you trying to twist my words around? When did I say the Holocaust was the Jews fault? Sounds like some Rush Limbaugh shit. I'm an idealist who believes happyness isn't something you find in a Bible. You accept happyness as the way you wish to be. Twisting my words is pointless and isn't﻿ going to get you anywhere. ANYWAYS, this song captures what I mean. I hope you realize :)

I understood you perfectly, you think religion is evil and the Jews caused their "own" problems. I don't have to twist anything, I'm just highlighting the pertinent parts of your hatred towards God and his people. The point of the﻿ Bible by the way, is God's salvation plan, not just happiness. Happiness comes from faith and especially being with him in heaven. I try not to look for happiness, but truth. But maybe you would be happier if you believed in God, you don't sound very happy now.

Atheists don't hate God or his people! We have the utmost respect for the people who follow ALL religions but we just don't believe in organised religion, afterlife's or all knowing deity's. I don't have a problem with anyone who follows a god even though I may disagree with﻿ their views. I would also never try to change their views...

I didn't mean to imply that all atheists hate religious people. I appreciate your liberal attitude as well, but I don't think it is wrong to try and convince others of what you believe, but we all have to be careful not to overstep our bounds, (as some Christian organizations have done unfortunately).
I think the reason this turned into a religious discussion is because of the themes of death, and life﻿ being an illusion - the song tells us to focus only on the present.

this is﻿ one of the best uplifting videos
i have almost died 4 times
2 this year
the last one i was bleeding to death and i thought a lot about this song and other stuff
now i have one of the best views on life
cause even though we will all die at some time
doesn't mean we should fear it
we should have the most fucking fun while you can
nothing last for ever

It's not the being dead part that scares me but what you've got to go through to get there.
Imagine having all of your﻿ flesh scraped off and bones snapping on the road under a truck. Imagine drowning by being trapped under water. Imagine the panic you'd experience.
Life's horrible - filled with horrible callous cruel people who don't care if you live or die and more often than not, the only way out is via true PAIN.
"Great setup God. Are you sure you like us?"

This song doesn't REALIZE that it's suicidal. Lets just say, I want to hang myself with a rope on a rainy day and shoot myself with my glock 45 in the leg before the hanging process. 2:28-2:35 makes me want﻿ to do it very soon as well.

Great cd and greater song...but uhm...I kind of felt the video was lacking [dancing showgirls and rabbits in downtown Vegas??? I was expecting to see something a little more powerful like, say '74-75' by The Connells or 'Since I﻿ Left You' by The Avalanches. Just my opinion. I still think At War With the Mystics was under-rated.

This band wouldn't do that to you. Make a video that moves your emotions﻿ in one way or another, that is. This is art, and they leave what emotions it evokes in you, the listener, entirely to you.

Although this song is amazing, and I love it, I think this was kinda poorly made.﻿ You could tell there was guitar, when he wasnt strumming, and there was singing when his mouth wasnt open. But this song is the best.

Every so often (if we are lucky) a moment comes alomg that changes our lives (if we want it to). I heard this song for the first time a couple of nights ago and one of those moments came along. If ever﻿ I'm feeling down and out I know I can put this song on and everything will be put back in perspective and unless I'm facing a life and death situation I know that everything will be fine. Just remember people that we are all just floating in space.

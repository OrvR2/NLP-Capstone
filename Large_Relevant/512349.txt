You did notice half a dozen armed criminals compared to one armed law abiding citizen right? How about gun control like every other civilized country in the world has.

You just made a point against gun control. Do you not realize that? Law abiding citizens will be the only ones to turn their guns in and not purchase illegal guns off the street. Criminals, whos guns are not registered anyways, will not turn in their guns and will have free reighn on anyone and everyone. Wake up!

Six armed criminals vs 1 armed law abiding person does not give a rational argument against gun control. Yeah, she scared off the criminals, but simple mathematics tells you that being out numbered 6-1 by people as well armed as you results in you and others in your business getting killed the majority of the time. 
Using this story to preach against gun control would be like using one of the rare examples of someone not wearing their seatbelt and getting thrown safely from the car in an accident to try and repeal seatbelt laws. Sure the rare examples exist, but their provably statistically in the minority and therefore stupid to try to use.

Of like the United Kingdom, where honest citizens have no means of defense against violent criminals and on the rare occasion when one does fight back, he goes to jail for it?

I am for the 2nd amendment whether you like it or not..That’s why we have to be on guard to protect the citizens in every place that needs helping hands for the police..if that gun of hers is registered, which I am sure it is, she has the authority to protect herself from the thugs that has guns, as if you didn’t notice…real or not…they stole and she is risking her life for her belongings…just so to speak.

Leo says:

Bill, I’m sorry – you just showed your own ignorance. The U.S. does not have the most people killed by gun violence (per capita) in the world. Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru gun killings are multiple times worse than the U.S., and in Venezuela it is ten times more prevalent than in the U.S. 
The U.S. rate is roughly comparable to that of Uruguay or Argentina – two countries with much lower gun ownership.

Reply 





Leo says: 

January 25, 2013 at 9:18 am 
Also, Mexico, which has severely limited gun ownership has a murder rate of 22.7, whereas the U.S. rate is 4.8 – and the U.S. has almost three times the population of Mexico.

Bill says: 

January 26, 2013 at 3:03 pm 
I should have specified 1st world nations. But go ahead and compare your country to Uruguay, Mexico etc. That’s a high goal. Don’t compare yourselves to countries like Greece, Finland, Italy Australia, Bulgaria, Germany, or literally over a dozen others I could list. All of which, per capita, look like freaking hippy peace colonies compared to the US. 
Or better yet compare yourselves to Canada, which has the same basic culture, all of the exact same media, and yet due to much stronger gun control laws has a VASTLY smaller number of gun murders per capita (less than a tenth).

Bill, we had an assault weapons ban from 1994 to 2004 and crime went virtually unchanged over this 10 year period. Controlling guns wont stop the evil within the hearts of men . Explain to me how banning guns will all of a sudden change the hearts of evil people.
Also, Chicago and DC have some of the most strict gun laws in the nation but have the highest crime rate. I promise to you that I will not try and make you own a gun if you will not try to make me give mine up.

Question. Are all of you more concerned about the selective ‘violence’ by gun rather than the constitutional right to own a gun? All this MSM sensationalism is to create fear, and a hope that the government can CONTROL what criminals do by legislating it. That’s like saying if murder, rape and robbery are illegal then we should all be safe. WTF

Reply 





Bill says: 

January 26, 2013 at 3:07 pm 
First, I’m not from the US so I don’t think of the constitution as some sort of sacred scriptures like you do. The ‘right to bear arms’ as it’s applied in your country is ridiculous. And your comparison is equally ridiculous. Do you think there’d be more rapes if it wasn’t illegal and there were no consequences. I’m pretty sure there would be. Which means making it illegal results in lesser numbers.

Im Canadian too Bill but I believe the the American constitution is a great document. It was also Revolutionary as was the Magna Carta. One of the steps for true freedom for all mankind. And also remind you that our freedom was handed to us like Australia. America had to fight for their freedom. The gun regestry in Canada did not prevent any murders. It was put into place to pacify the scared masses after the horrific shooting in Quebec. All it did was criminalize honest Canadians and cost billions. The goverment never lets a good tragedy go to waste. Thank god for making murder and rape illegal! What else would keep you from your urges to kill and rape,eh?

also there are states in the US with lots of guns and low gun homicides. in fact as low as australia, a country that anti-gun nuts love to use as a wonderful win for gun control. so, your argument is invalid. try again.

Criminals will always get there hands on guns. The law abiding citizens have the right to defend themselves against such crime. Capital punishment is needed back in this country. Then maybe you will see less crime. Not by taking our guns away.

IndyMason says: 

January 27, 2013 at 3:22 pm 
Of COURSE there is a connection between guns and gun deaths. There is also a connection between knives and knife deaths, between cars and car deaths, and between swimming pool ownership and swimming pool deaths. Would you ban cars and swimming pools (both of which kill more people than guns every year)?
You fail to notice that there is also a strong positive correlation between gun ownership and crime prevention (defensive gun use) — see, for example, the recent story about an AR-15 being used be an RIT student to drive off two robbers inside his home (one of whom was armed and pointing a gun at the intended victim).
By the way, there is nothing in the Constitution that says anything about hunters’ rights. The Second Amendment states that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, and states why that right is important. Rifles are “arms” — like it or not, it’s in the Constitution, and for a very good reason. Your attempts to limit that right are ill-conceived and dangerous. The Second Amendment is all about giving citizens a last resort — armed insurrection — should the government become a tyranny. 
I challenge you to educate yourself! Read the history of the Second Amendment — a good starting point is “The Founders’ Second Amendment” by Stephen P. Halbrook. (If you’d like, I’ll buy you a copy of it if you’ll agree to have a private discussion with me about it.)
Learn more about American history, and world history. The world we live in is not a perfect place. There is no step we can possibly take that will ensure that something like the tragedy in Sandy Hook will never happen again. The question is this — how do we balance freedom and safety? Until you change the Constitution, the answer is clear: we citizens have the right to keep and bear arms. Period.
As a father of three, I understand the scope of that tragedy. But as a rational person, I keep it in perspective. This is an emotionally charged issue, and we must keep that in mind. The last time the government got so excited about something, we ended up with the Patriot Act, in which our rights under the 1st, 4th and 6th amendments were abandoned.

I’m genuinely curious as to why you think they wouldn’t have guns. What I’ve found is that no matter how illegal or banned the government tries to make something, the people who want it will find a way to get it… sometimes it even makes scoring it more enticing.
So, really, why wouldn’t they have guns? Do you really think that these guys are going to obey the law?

Bill says:

Gun control has been proven beyond any reasonable doubt to work by countries all over the world. It makes guns far FAR less accessible to criminals. Less guns in criminals hands equals less gun crimes. The only country who’s citizens doubt this is the US, because you have some disturbing obsession with staying armed no matter how many innocent people end up in body bags.

I do have an obsession to staying armed to protect myself and my family. I was 34 when I was raped and at that time I swore it would never happen again and I’ve carried since that time for the last 30+ years. I’ve never had to draw my weapon and threaten anyone, but I’ve had to put my hand on it a couple times, but the situation disapated.
Now don’t get all crazy and try to diagnose my rape situation and say I couldn’t have stopped it with a weapon. You don’t know…I do as I was there.
I also have an obsession to protect myself from a tyrannical government, which we are dangerously close to in the USA. You may take our guns, but it will not be without horrendous fight fight and millions of deaths. So if you are worried about unnecessary deaths…go ahead and come after our guns.

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
As ratified by the States and authenticated by Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State:

It’s funny to me that Americans are so obsessed over owning guns that someone who disagrees must not be serious.
Do you not actually see how comparing real gun control to the situation in Washington or Chicago is ridiculous. Of course it’s not going to work if it’s only enforced in such a tiny little area and people can go for a short drive to where it’s not enforced. 
On the other hand look at Canada, which has nation wide gun control and a gun death rate so small compared to yours (and yes, per capita) that it makes your country look like a war zone in comparison (yes that’s hyperbole).
You go ahead and keep your Yosemite Sam-like love of guns, meanwhile we’ll just sit up here above the border enjoying not having mass school shootings every year.

Hey Bill. You’re still here? 
Remember that bombing in Oklahoma at the Federal building? McVea used a van loaded with fertilizer.
We need stronger Federal laws against violence committed with guns, not more control of guns. It would also help if the FEDS would actually uphold the laws once they’re passed, but they don’t and haven’t in many years. Did you hear Biden say there wasn’t time to uphold those laws? He said it. 
Typical dumbass. So I say, lets shove all the libtards off on Canada. The rest of us will work, pay less taxes and live in a free society, carry our guns and keep each other honest.

With all the whining about movie and video game violence, it must just boggle your mind that Canadians consume all the exact same media and yet manage not to shoot each other. Okay, so it’s not the media. How about stricter punishment for violent offenders? What’s that, our punishments are no stricter, in fact sometimes less strict? Gee, can’t be that. Hmm… what could it be? What could possibly be stopping our kids from ending up in body bags? Oh wait! We have strong gun control laws! And with that we have less than a tenth of the gun murders the US does! 
Oh, and take your ridiculous two-party only system and keep it to yourself. I don’t care about Democrats or Republicans, Conservatives or Liberals, what matters here is the US obsession with gun ownership despite the number of your own people (including kids) ending up in body bags for it. The sad thing is that you don’t even realize what a sad joke you look like to other countries over this issue. Yosemite Sam should be your mascot at this point.

The fear, or threat, of conviction would be enough to drive a person who eould not otherwise kill to kill. What would be the difference but a chance to escape and not spend a life in prison.

The cop’s comments at the end are EXACTLY wrong! In any self defense situation, immediate action beats delayed response hands-down. Allowing your assailants time yo consolidate their position is folly. Immediate decisive resistance will burst their little fantasy bubble, with the results seen here. Waiting around would have allowed a hostage situation to develop.

I’m bored with the endless debate regarding the relative effectiveness of gun control to reduce crime or accidental death. 
I have the right to life and therefore the right to defend my life with a gun if necessary. I am not willing to surrender that right to make my fellow citizens feel safer.

I am a woman. I live with my 15 year old son alone in Texas. I work in a side of town where I’m approached once or twice a month by indigents trolling for a hand out. And when they approach, the sneak up on you. None have ever attempted to hurt me but there is a chance.
I’m the only mother my 15 year old son has and as a minor, he’s unable to carry a weapon. I will take care of me for him. I carry a glock and I am a CHL carrier. I remember when Texas didn’t allow CHL’s and that incident at Luby’s in Killeen. In that restaurant there were more than a dozen law abiding citizens who’d left their weapons in their cars, all of them at the mercy of a merciless killer. None of them had the option except to be a victim or pray that the police would arrive before it was too late for them. It was too late for many of them but some survived but not before he took at a dozen or more others.
I hit the gun range once a month. I have learned to think in terms of tactics. I have a plan if I’m approached. I have a plan if someone breaks into my home, if there’s time, he’s not on me yet, he’ll get a verbal to get out or die. If there’s no time, he dies. End of story. I am a Christian but I don’t believe God calls us to be victims of monsters so I have no qualms about taking one out and I will just pray that I’ve maybe spared the next person he would have attacked after me, assuming I’m still alive.
It’s all about rights. We have the right to bear arms. It’s in the Bill of Rights. It’s not the Bill of Needs, so cut that crap now.
You can’t compare issues in Texas and Arizona, especially with border patrol offices being either closed or cut back on staff due to the sham our economy is in, with Connecticut. I know many on the border towns who have guns and with good reason. They are law-abiding citizens and what are they supposed to do, just give up their rights and property to criminals from Mexico? Hell no. 
This is a State’s rights issue. Every state has different factors that weigh heavily into this argument and you can’t say what works for NY works for El Paso. That is why states are given those rights. It’s a big country!
There are ways to make the laws against criminals who use guns tougher, but mostly, the Feds just need to do their damn job and CONVICT those criminals when they’re caught. 
There are also ways to make accidents with guns and those who legally use them, less prevalent. If you own, take classes in tactics. I think there ought to be shooting, tactics, self defense classes offered all over the US at colleges and universities. Gun safety courses, shooting ranges where you can bring your gun and ammo and learn proper technique, but you know, it’s getting really hard to afford ammo and again, that’s where the only ones who get their hands on ammo is the criminal!! 
All those “Demand a Plan” ads with all the Hollywood hypocrites, that’s a great idea, but flip that. Have a plan on what you’ll do if your attacked or your home is broken in to. Know what you’ll do before you have to do it. Plan for every eventuality and you’ll have a better chance of both you and the intruder surviving. Again, he’ll get told to get out or die, and half a step the wrong direction and he’s dead. No problem for me.
In Switzerland they assign guns to homes, but they are also required to take classes to learn to use them. 
If you’re scared of guns, before you freak out, learn about them. Go to a range, fire guns. I USED to be scared of them. My 21 year old who is no longer living at home, when he got his Sig .45, I was scared. I will admit! First time he went to someone’s house and that person owned a gun, admittedly, I worried. But I made sure to get to know that parent and feel comfortable with them, never accusing them of anything, just doing the parenting thing I should do anyway and get to the families of the friends where my kids hang out. 
Okay then. Carry on.

Joolz, I agree with you all the way. In Missouri, before you can get your CCW, you do have to take classes. I think the same way that you do. If someone breaks into my home and attepts to threaten my life, he will be shot dead. I am not waiting for that person to aim at me first. He has no right in my home. And if you don’t shoot to kill, if you just maim him, he has the right to take you to court and sue you for damages. Is that a joke or what? If the government can’t control illegal drug traffic how do they think they can control criminals from having guns? It is so dumb on their part. I do believe that people who own guns should teach their children about them and how dangerous they can be. I had 2 kids grow up in my home we had guns they were in a gun case the kids were taken to a range and shown what those guns could do when fired. Those kids never attempted to touch any of those firearms the whole time they were growing up. They are now both of age to own their own guns and they do and they have taught their children what the guns can do as well as how to use them, they never touch those guns without their dad present and only at a range. The ones that are getting their hands on guns are usually the ones that the guns are left unattended by an adult or older sibling.

I still doubt that most citizens even with proper training would be able to keep a cool head in a true emergency and be able to use a gun at all for defense, or even if they do manage to use it, be able to use it properly. They’d probably shoot themselves in the leg first. Have you met the general public? There’s no shortage of people who are hyper, impatient, impulsive, foolish, stupid, and any combination thereof. Some of them aren’t even competent enough to drive a vehicle, let alone carry a deadly firearm. Firearms belong in the hands of trained professionals- law enforcement and armed forces. Not civilians trying to play renegade hero. 2nd Amendment yadda yadda. The Bill of Rights is outdated for the times we live in. The U.S. has gone bat sh#t crazy! People will kill you over absolutely nothing if given the chance, and you want these people armed?! Do you have any idea how many people are running around out there with undiagnosed mental disorders? Aka they would not have any problem passing a background check? Let’s give them guns too while we’re at it. If our forefathers would’ve seen this coming, they probably would’ve said F this and sailed right back where they came from!

THANK YOU!!!
Anyone that things the general public, with only a few hours of training, would be able to keep a level head and react rationally during an attack or shootout needs to take a refresher course in Psych 101 about how the parasympathetic nervous system works.
Police and armed forces have weeks, months, of training and still occasionally make mistakes.

Problem is Marci, that’s not for YOU, or any of you libtards to decide. I’ve made up my mind. I’d rather take my chances on living rather than being raped or watching my son die, or being raped while my son watches. Yeah. That’s right. But you see, it’s really my decision because what all of you chicken-assed-bleeding heart liberals have forgotten is that it’s in THE BILL OF RIGHTS!!

I may not share your opinion but calling me a “libtard”, which is offensive to both democratic ideas and people with mental disabilities, is completely beyond UNNECESSARY. Nothing in my comment attacked what you had been through or your personal beliefs, only stated scientifically why I don’t agree with you.
I would respond to the rest of your comment but seeing that it’s full of nothing but insults, hate, and complete lack of understanding of the differences between rights and privileges so I won’t grace you with a dignified response. Good luck in the rest of your life and dear god…. good luck to your poor son.

hmm,, we don’t have enough training? How about this story of 2 unarmed dead, cops shoot 137 rounds? You will find ccw people do much better most of the time. Victims Don’t have the luxury of waiting for backup.

B, we are a country of laws. Some of them, overbearing, and foolish. But laws, none the less. Our country was founded because they had experienced a tyrannical government who had come to take their weapons. They decided that the best way to keep their freedom was to keep their guns, and fight their oppressors. If you do not want to own a gun, that is well within your control. I would never think of insisting that you arm yourself. Please do not insist that I can not. As far as the rules for gun ownership, and mental illness, I think it would be a far greater measure to eliminate violence by outlawing dangerous, mind altering narcotics, for anyone under 20 years old. Their brains and bodies are not completely developed, and the sad fact that nobody seems to want to confront is that drugs are tested on adults BY LAW. Once they are deemed safe, they are then prescribed to the very same youth that drug companies are forbidden to use as test subjects. This practice has the same logical disconnect as gun laws stopping criminals from getting and using guns.

Bill, nobody kills Canadians because nobody cares (sarcasm). You have to be a complete moron not to get why citizens should have guns. There is not a single argument that holds up under scrutiny in favor of gun control.

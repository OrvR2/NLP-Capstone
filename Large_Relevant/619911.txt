Chris Christie Slams ‘Reprehensible’ NRA For ‘Dragging People’s Children’ Into Gun Control Debate

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie slammed the National Rifle Association’s latest ad in which they accuse President Barack Obama of hypocrisy for sending his children to a school where they are protected by armed guards. Christie called the ad “reprehensible” and said that the NRA should not be “dragging people’s children” into the gun control debate.

“I think any of us who are public figures, you see that kind of ad and you cringe,” Christie said on Thursday at a news conference in Trenton. “I’m a father who is a public figure, who has four children and my children had no choice realistically in what I decided to do with my career and what affect that has had on their lives.”
“Don’t be dragging people’s children into this,” he added. “It’s wrong and I think it demeans them and it makes them less of a valid trusted source of information on the real issues that confront this debate.”
“Are the president’s kids more important than yours?” the narrator in the NRA advertisement asks. “Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school?”
“Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he’s just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security,” the controversial ad concludes.

A sane Republican voice.  Now watch as the Republican radicals go after that voice.

He really needs to become a Democrat. He has something no other Republican has, common sense. And his own party hates him for it. It makes the rest of them look bad, plus the fact that he’s not nearly crazy enough to be part of the GOP. There’s no way he would make it thru a primary as he refuses to talk like a crazy man with his head on fire.
Come on over Governor, the sanity is refreshing.
Plus….he’s FOR science and education!

Make no mistake.  If Rush doesn’t attack Christie for this, it’s because Rush is afraid of Christie.






smileyhappy3



Just to throw some facts at Chris Christie:
One of the NRA proposal’s was to have armed guards at schools.  The proposal was mocked by Washington elitists (David Gregory) as well as politicians (Barack Obama).  But, these same people send their kids to a schools that employs armed guards – not the secret service – armed guards employed by the school.  So, the NRA produces an ad mocking these people for that and the left, media and wannabe’s (Christie) attacks them for it.  None of these people care about the substance of the ad, they only care about advancing their own political agendas.

Are you kidding? Christie is most certainly not for education! That’s the reason why the GOP loves him.

Reconsider.  Did you know that the unemployment rate here in New Jersey hit 9.8% back in September of last year, before Sand hit?  Oddly it began to climb after he took office and it’s still higher than the national rate at 9.6%.  He’s also a womb chaser (anti-abortion zelot).  He’s also a favorite of Wall Street.  Don’t be fooled by his current campaign of sanity.  Next to his party of confederate loser states, he only seems sane!

Children’s fears are totally rational, and we should have a signing ceremony weekly to allay them. Let’s conflate isolated incidents that on par do not equal the number of children that die in swimming pools  annually, with a national epidemic.

Missing the forrest for the trees, Governor.  This was about hypocrisy.  The children of the average American citizen should have the same right to protection in school as do the children of the President of the United States…or the governor of New Jersey.

Key Demographic



Though we’ve had other horrific mass shootings in the past four years, the Sandy Hook shooting was, apparently, the one SO unspeakable that it prompted an actual, prolonged conversation.
It’s not about the likelihood of one demographic (children) being murdered more often than another in mass shootings. It’s about moving on from the literal worst incarnation we’ve seen yet. Therefore, children.
Or attribute it to scoring political points if you think we really need to emotionally sell to the American public the need to actually enforce current gun laws and look into the backgrounds of felons.

And in every one there was a mother who was entitled to make decisions about her own body herself and get an abortion if she chose.  If you have not already done so, read Roe v. Wade.  I think it is well reasoned.

Was it?  I don’t recall seeing any provision allowing the same type of armed security at schools NOT being attended by children of high-level government officials or high-profile celebrities.






Anonymous



At a 76% approval rating – people are listening to Gov. Christie.  And well they should.  He made us believers after Sandy ravaged the East coast – belief that two parties could come together as one – to help those who needed it the most.
And now he begs our belief once more.  He rails at an ad so reprehensible  – and well he should.  
This NRA ad is but a symptom of the words and messages that those on the fringe are sending – and politicians like Christie are speaking out against them.
I am disgusted by these words – and I ask – why aren’t you?






Andrew C Eden-Balfour



Here’s the thing though. As it would certainly sting though, the reality is that the children of world leader’s are more important to protect then the average children, as they are ten thousand times more likely to be kidnapped by crazy people and be held for ransom. 
Plus, a couple of the executive actions signed by Obama provide just that.
12. Provide law enforcement, first responders, and school officials with proper training for active shooter situations.
18. Provide incentives for schools to hire school resource officers.






Andrew C Eden-Balfour



You do realize that your really loosing the argument when you try to change the topic completely to something that has nothing to do with gun violence and the topic of this story?

The operative word in your comment was “average”, as in average citizen.  The children of the president are prime targets for our enemies both here and abroad.  They are by no means “average” children.  
Yes, all children deserve to be safe in their schools – and the president tried to make that possible yesterday.  But it will take ALL of us to make that happen.
But please – stop the silly talk.  And it is silly talk.  (I do not say that to be rude)

When I saw the AD…I didn’t take it as Obama was not entitled to security…I took it as Obama did not think Americans were entitled to security for THEIR children when his has protection and I am sure have had protection since they began school.  It was his “skepticism” that the NRA was attacking…not his protection of his children.  Christie needs to lighten up…as it is he will never be a contender on the national stage.  He needs to join the Dem party…I am sure he will end up signing the union bill passing through his congress disallowing workers the right to work if they are not union members on any Sandy Construction.






Mr. Sinister



So did President Obama personally fly in on a black helicopter to force those little kids to write letters urging him to address gun violence? Or did the FEMA brainwashing camps make the kids do it? Oh! I know, he made a secret executive order to the Hawaii department of secret forged documents to have them write the letters, then he flew in some child actors for the signing ceremony!
To me, If kids write letters asking him to address gun violence, it sounds like they are volunteering their voice to be included in the debate. Unless, of course, you are against freedom of speech.

Excuse me but Adam Lanza (and his Mom’s AR-15) was the one who made it all about the children! 
Presideoplnts always invite people affected by the legislation or documents being signed to stand with him during the ceremonies. This time is was some of the (many) children of Newtown who wrote to him specifically and asked him to do something about gun violence. He invited them and their parents and they accepted.
Did the NRA ask Obama’s girls permission to use them in an ad? Do you think they would have agreed if they had been asked?
This is just another rightwing false equivalency. Excuses, excuses, excuses, followed by no, no, no, followed by Chicken Little fear and big-money-generated hatred. That is all I know of the Republican party these days. Chris Christie is the exception.

A sane Republican voice?  What a joke.  This man isn’t sane.  He literally just blasted the NRA for bringing the kids into it, but how did he feel when Obama brought kids on stage with him as props, to sign his executive whatever it was.  Photo op.
Chris Christie is a liberal.  He clearly never was a conservative.  He stopped making sense when he HUGGED obama following Sandy – Andrew Cuomo didn’t even do that.  And when he attacked the Republican Controlled house for not passing that pork laden bill, rather than asking both sides to cut the fat out of the bill, he clearly proved that he is no conservative, but a leftist operative.

It’s an election year.  Christie has to pander until November, and then he’ll be right back to the bloated a-hole he’s always been.  As phony and opportunistic as they come.  At least he’s killed any chance of being nominated for President by the Republican party.
He’s the Joe Lieberman of Republicans.  Only popular with the other party that lives outside his state.

Do you complain that Donald Trump sent his children to private schools? Many of Washington’s “elite” have children in that very same school. And the guards are there because the parents paid for it. This is a capitalist society, or did you forget that? You have money, you have what money buys. The Secret Service protection for the Obama girls is extra. That school has had armed guards for years. It’s a PRIVATE school. They can do much more than a public school can, because they pay extra for it.

I saw the ad.  The ad was not about the secret service protection for the Obama children, it was about their attending a school for the wealthy, including the children of David Gregory, and the fact the school has security staff armed with firearms.  Nothing in the ad is saying the Obama children shouldn’t have secret service protection; it is saying it is hypocritical for the president to send his kids to a school he knows has armed security IN ADDITION TO THE secret service protection his kids have, and he wants to deny that right (having armed guards at our schools) to the rest of us.

The answer to your question is as follows: Kid, the US government took us into two wars in during the Bush admin and charged them to credit card China. At the same time they also passed a drug prescription program and charged it to credit card China. And less we forget the also implemented the “Bush” tax cuts and yes, you guessed it they charged that too on the China credit card too. You see when the “Bush” admin started there was a surplus in the United States budget. But along came the GOP who controlled both the  House and the senate and the WH for 7 years and the surplus disappeared and the deficit was created. The economy went to hell in a handbasket and well, the rest is history. So even though the Republicans and the Tea Party try to blame all the failings of this country in recent years on  President Obama, if the truth be told we are trying to dig out of the hole they created with tax cuts, less spending, and smaller government. They owe that “kid” you mention in your comment.






dstouffermd



Wrong.
But we spoke to parents who said they had never seen a guard on campus with a weapon. And Ellis Turner, associate head of Sidwell Friends, told us emphatically: “Sidwell Friends security officers do not carry guns.”
Sidwell Friends, by the way, has two distinct campuses, a lower school in Bethesda and a middle and upper schools in Washington. So given shift rotations and three different schools, it appears that the 11 “armed guards” is really just one or two unarmed guards per school at a time.

.
A bipartisan band of New York lawmakers are pointing out that the state’s recently passed gun control law stunningly fails to include any exemptions for law enforcement officers and technically prohibits police from ever bringing guns on school grounds or possessing extended ammo magazines.
The NY SAFE Act, which was championed and signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, bans all magazines that hold more than seven bullets and pre-1994 high capacity magazines, and prohibits the carrying of guns on school grounds.
But because no loophole for law enforcement was included in the law, every police officer in the state is technically in violation of the statute.
Spokespersons for the Governor’s Office said the issues in the rushed bill would be addressed as soon as practical.

Do your homework Elaine.  Obama didn’t drag anyone including those kinds into the Gun Control Debate.  They came there voluntarily with their parents.  Besides, they wrote the President telling him why they wanted stricter gun controls.  Also, to your comment about illegal signing of executive orders, name those of those executive orders that are illegal.  And yes Republicans that accuse Obama of hypocrisy for sending his children to a school where they are protected by armed guards are radicals.  Christie knows it and has called out his Party.  Bottom-line, the WH is saying keep it up Republicans.  The whole country is seeing the Republican Party for what it is – an obstructionist, radical, name calling party with no compass.  The more they whine and scream and yell their nonsense, the closer the Democrats get to retaking the House in 2014.  This is not the party of Lincoln, or T. Roosevelt, or Eisenhower, or Nixon, or Reagan, or Bush 41 or 43.  This is a political party which has lost it’s way and is heading toward irrelevance unless it wakes up to reality.

Elaine you are right…but sometimes being a radical is a good thing…”The notion that a radical is one who hates his country is naive and usually idiotic. He is, more likely, one who likes his country more than the rest of us,and is thus more disturbed than the rest of us when he sees it debauched.
He is not a bad citizen turning to crime; he is a good citizen driven to despair”.

It’s a private school, and it is not cheap. You can send your kids to a private school. There’s no rule against it. And as a parent, you can be one of those deciding how to protect the children. It just costs money. You have plenty of that, right?

So how does No. 16 –  “Clarify that the Affordable Care Act does not prohibit doctors asking their patients about guns in their homes.” abolish doctor-patient confidentiality?  It says nothing about abolishing doctor- patient confidentiality.  Instead it simply clarifies that doctors are allowed to ask their patients about guns in their homes.
So how does No. 17 – “Release a letter to health care providers clarifying that no federal law prohibits them from reporting threats of violence to law enforcement authorities.” abolish doctor-patient confidentiality?  As in No. 16 above it says nothing about abolishing doctor-patient confidentiality.  Instead it simply clarifies that there are no federal laws prohibiting doctors from reporting threats of violence to law enforcement authorities.

Illegal signing of executive orders??! 
Yeah. Another thing President Obama just made up in his quest to be King of the World. Just like he made up a department tasked largely with guarding himself and his family, and he called it the “Secret” Service. (Eeeeeek!!) Commissioned a plane for his own personal use and called it Air Force One. (I hear he named it after the movie.) Had his scientists invent a machine that would allow him to read a speech without looking down at paper. Called it a “teleprompter.” 
Oh, heavens. If I were to list all of the things as unprecedented as executive orders, I could be here all night.

The only one exploiting children as he awkardly hugs them at his press conference, is the man who thinks he’s been annointed King of the United States, and has the right to jump around Congress.  nevermind that taking guns from the good guys will only increase crime.  Check Chicago, UK, Australia.  All suffering from record crime rates AFTER they enacted strict gun laws or banned them all together.  Stick to facts, clowns.  Your argument holds no water.

There they go again! The name calling TEA-types making rampant comments assailing moderates, the president and children. It was the outright murder of innocent children which started this conversation. The NRA has come to the defense of the indefensible. It would unconscionable to exploit the president’s children while adding additional level of gun fire into the school setting. The majority of teachers are against guns in school. Cross-fires and stray bullets have killed more children on the streets, much less in the confines of a school room. Under no condition is it feasible for additional guns to be on a school campus unless the perp has been confined to one area where no harm can occur. There is no justification what-so-ever to arm a teacher except in Israel. Thess pseudo-Republican has no clue of what is in the president’s mind and is trying to paint Obama a different color. First, Obama’s not trying to thwart the 2nd Amendment or confiscate people’s guns. Second, if you look at Obama’s executive orders, he orders more background research on purchases. All cannot be printed here, but rest assured his primary concern is limiting gun acxcess or ownership to mentally challenged or those deemed incapable of clear thought process. Kinda fits the TEA-types doesn’t it? If you are sick and tired of the gross incompetence and nothing getting done by the house and Senate, do not sit on the sidelines and allow the few with the most power and stroke to make decisions that will effect you directly without your input. The once proud party of Lincoln and Reagan, which has free-failed into extreme radical extremism, needs to be resurrected. The 2014 mid-term election is a-coming! Get ready to get out the vote. The TEA-types are out in force in certain regions. It’s going to take work – Now, Let’s get to work – Time’s a wasting!

The children were being recognized for their contribution to society.  Each child had a parent standing with them.  Each parent appeared happy and honored to have their child recognized by the President.  So that I might better understand your rant, please help me to know just what you have deemed “illegal” in the executive orders on gun laws the President signed? I hear the terminology illegal being used quite frequently today; but there have been no specifics regarding what is illegal.

So much stupidity… Too many retorts… Fingers might cramp….
1) most Americans are actually saying “don’t arm the teachers.” It’s a silly and dangerous idea. Police are trained for months to handle these exact types of situations, teachers aren’t. If you think a teacher with a gun is more effective then a cop on campus, then I want some of what you’re smoking.
2) if you do want to have armed security for your children, then by all means enroll them in a private school that offers that. We have a free market here, dontchaknow.
3) the actual ad that Christie is referring to suggests that Obama is being a hypocrite for having security for his children. First of all, it would be a national security threat if his children are kidnapped, so they need security. I doubt the security at the school was even on Obama’s radar, since his kids have full time secret service security.
4) if states want to allow teachers to carry guns, they apparently have the right to. President Obama isn’t stopping them. Utah is already allowing it.
5) I reserve my right to call the armed teacher idea stupid and dangerous. In those situations, the teachers should be leading the children away from danger, while the trained police officers handle the shooter.

Your hypocrisy is astounding.  Are you claiming that there are sooo many abortions that Romney could make millions off abortions?  Are you that stupid?
Do you know what “medical waste” would include?  Would you have preferred that the waste company have special containers for dead fetus’ only – and the other container for other body parts?  
You don’t seem to understand that waste from abortion clinics was so well hidden due to fear of the waste getting into wrong hands.  
p.s.  body parts – including fetus’ were/are taken to crematoriums.  The same one’s that your dead relatives are taken to for cremation.  Before the great “cleanse” – hospitals had their own incinerators and burned them on site.

OK Christie, you lost my vote should you ever decide to run for potus. Obama used children, not even his own by displaying them on stage when signing his executive actions. The point of the NRA, is that the presidents children’s lives are just as valuable as my grandchildren and if it comes to it should be afforded armed protection at least while at school. It’s understood that they are in a spotlight they didn’t ask for, But they too deserve protection in school even if they were not children of POTUS  just like the rest of the children. Let’s take some immediate action and put resource officers in the schools now. Assign a patrol officer to a school like you would one for a sector car. Then, let’s talk about how to get a handle on the crazies, the violence that drives the shooting and getting more of the guns off the streets for some of the street crime shootings. I don’t understand you CC I really don’t think you needed more face time on the media.

Folks, focus on school safety and school security. Note that they are trying so hard to get our attention off the school problem and make us think it is a gun problem. There are so many tools available to cause mayhelm other than guns. We really need on site immediate armed response and upgraded school buildings. Now the politicains do not want to secure the schools and want us to think the problem is guns. It is true that a child is more likely to be hit by lightning on the playground than to be shot at school. So I can understand their attitude. However, we can see how this tragedy pulled the national attention. So it is important that we focus on school safety.

Homicides by guns equaled .003% of the population in 2011, yet there are over 300,000,000 guns in the US, how does it make sense to go after law abiding citizens for sleaze bags that have no regard for the law?  I wonder how many of those shooters were the registered gun owners of the guns they used?  We do not have a gun problem, we have a judicial problem, Obama voted “present” for harsher punishments for school shooters, yet now he is punishing legal and responsible gun owners.  Obama needs to go after Alcohol, it was responsible for over 50,000 deaths in 2010, which included 211 children that were 14 and under.  How about concentrating on our national debt, passing and balancing a budget, that alone would protect our children’s futures (if he really cares)…..  Let’s see how brave the liberals are in Congress, let’s see Harry bring gun control up for a vote, oh yeah, he won’t because the NRA contributes BIG TIME to his campaign fund…….  HYPOCRITES!

They do not understand that the Constitution of the United States protects the natural rights of Americans from abuse by government.
They do not know it is the 2nd Amendment that gives the Constitution its power.
They do not know that violent crime in the US has fallen dramatically as gun ownership and concealed carry has increased; an armed society is a polite society.
They do not know, or ignore, that if our homicide statistics are adjusted for the inner city (Chicago) low information Obama voter gang-bangers, our rates are among the lowest in the civilized world.
They do not know, or ignore, the fact that the problem is one of a minority culture that glorifies ignorance and violence.
They do not know, or ignore, that Democrat/leftist/progressive/moronic gun bans just make law abiding citizens potential victims which means they are part of the problem, not part of the solution.

Hey dip sh&t, look into the 1928 Law on Firearms that was enhanced by the Nazi’s Weapons Law.  If my rights are not being taken away, then why did Obama have to sign an Executive Order relating to guns?  Is this order going to change my right to ammunition and guns in any way?  That’s what I thought.  I don’t watch Fox, it doesn’t take a genius to find information in today’s world.  Try it sometime.  Has Congress enacted a law changing guns in anyway?

That story, like most from Slate, approach that incident from the perspective that guns are bad and, therefore, this close call proves that nobody should be allowed to have one.
The other side of the situation is that this law abiding and sensible gun owner, in the heat of the moment, made the right decision.
Pity he, and more like him, were not in the audience when the shooting started because he might have been able to react quickly enough save some of the people that were lost.
I know that thought just galls the hell out of you but more legal guns mean fewer illegal gun crimes.

Normally I just walk away from someone who conducts themselves in such a way that makes it suspect whether they even have the wherewithal to find the “On” button on their computer without the help of an adult or guardian…but I really can’t resist.
Why did President Obama have to sign and Executive Order? *sigh* He signed TWENTY-THREE Executive Orders! “Is this order going to change my right to ammunition and guns in any way?” Again…it’s “Are these orderS…?” Because there are TWENTY-THREE of them. And I’ll tell you the answer, since you’re too f*cking stupid to know yourself…and we know you’re too f*cking stupid for two reasons…
1. You didn’t know there were 23.
2. If your rights were taken away…ANY rights…AT ALL…you would have said so. “Oh yeah!” you would have frantically typed, “What about THIS right that’s taken away because of Executive Order number blah-blah-blah!?!?!? GOTCHA!!!!” 
But you didn’t. Because there weren’t. ANY rights taken away. None.
I will now borrow a quote directly from you and throw it back in your smug face: “it doesn’t take a genius to find information in today’s world.  Try it sometime.”
Speaking of smug: “You might want to read the Constitution, only Congress has the right to enact legislation, the President must enforce it, you know, by that silly little OATH he takes when he is elected.” Yes. You were quite smug there…but do you have a point? Because no legislation was “enacted.” At all. All President Obama did was utilize powers enumerated to him in the constitution. You might want to read it sometime. And you might want to study your history. This president is on pace to sign less EO’s than any other president before him. Yep…”TYRANNY!!!”
The scary thing about you lunatics is how absolutely CERTAIN you are that your ignorance is actually knowledge. This exchange, for example. I’m confident that despite the fact that I just SPANKED your ass and showed you for the fool that you are…you’ve learned nothing.

Christie is rapidly becoming Crist (Florida RINO and new Demagogue). His sucking up to Obama during the Sandy FEMA fiasco and several other comments he has made recently leads one to think that he has already jumped ship. He has sure killed himself with the GOP.

obama has no problem at all dragging other people’s children into this.  Christie is becoming just another elitist.

I thought the reason that all of us are having the debate on gun control is because a mentally disturbed young man was able to take guns into a school a kill 20 school children and 6 adults.  He was only challenged by a couple of unarmed school administrators who he killed.  The NRA proposed to put armed police or other trained personnel in all schools to protect our most valuable resource (our children).  There are many elitist in our country who pay to have their children in private school, many of which have armed guards to protect them (like the our president).  President Obama’s children are certainly a big part of the point.  Why should the average citizen have their children less protected simply because we send our children to public (i.e., government) schools.

Obama sure had no problem using children for his photo-op to sign his non-excutive orders.






Bob McCormick



This is a ridiculous debate, the NRA
made a valid point. The NRA add did not harm the Obama kids in any
way, and was nowhere near as egregious as using actual children as
political props, as Obama did.
All the NRA did was point out that Obama
is the worst kind of hypocrite, as he works to take our God given
right to protect ourselves and our families, as we see fit under the
law, he grants himself lifetime secret service protection and has his
children protected by an army of security officers and secret
service. He does not believe his own BS, we know he doesn’t give a
damn about Sandy Hook, our children, the loss of innocent life he
keeps harping on. What he is after is the disarmament of the American
people as part of his agenda to make us all subjects of an imperial
government.
Do you think governor lard a$$ missed
the Obama kiddy photo op? Why do you think he neglected to mention
Obama’s exploitation of children while sensationalizing the NRA add?
Because he is a hypocrite just like his buddy Obama that’s why.

Gay have rights to say anything they want, as do muslims and people of color, but let a white person or Christian say anything in defense of tehir beliefs and they are labeled as haters by the lib’s. The only “haters” in this country are the lib’s and those whose agendas they support.

doesnt matter anyway, the liberal bleeding hearts wont let anyone fry for the murder they commit because it is “cruel and unusual punishment” to make someone pay for their crime. and besides, it is probably someone elses fault they did it – probably Bush’s fault!






IRONSIDE



Or how about a sane comparison that says it’s ok for the liar-in-chief to have a stage full of untraumatized childeren to push his unconsitutional agenda.  Better check this out more throroughly–Sandy Hook did not happen, it was a training exercise–you can find the video on youtube and it shows and reveals some very starlling revelations; like the supposed grieving father who is standing there laughing and joking and asking if he’s on yet (obviously did not know the cameras were rolling) and watch him literally get into character of the sobbing parent.  The video does not lie.  It’s very disturbing to think that even a scumbag like obama would or could do something like this…it means this whole terrible mess that’s about to come down on us has a lot of government agencies involved.  Go watch the video and you tell me.
This is not the conspiracy video, this is CNN Anderson Cooper denying it and he does not ccome off too well.  I guess there are plenty more videos out there.  I don’t know what did or did not happen…and that is because there is no trust anymore in the government or in the media.  I know Obama used kids on stage for his talking points, why can’t the NRA ask a legitimate question.  Watch Anderson Cooper  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G-UNwE1pWU

Obama started using children to make his case first, standing on the bodies of murdered children to try and further his anti-American, socialist agenda. The NRA made a very valid point, just because Obama chose a high profile career that may endanger his children was his choice, it doesn’t entitle his children or him the  protection he wants to denying American citizens! Anyway, this gun-grab is not about saving lives, it’s about disarming the citizens.

Are our kids supposed to be target practice while Obama’s kids have an ARMY of ARMED AGENTS for protection?  No, Christie, you are WRONG as usual.

It’s called freedom of speech! Slander is when idiots stand up and show disrespect and yell at the president of the United States during the State of the Union Speech.

I stand on my words – If you are sick and tired of the gross incompetence and nothing getting done by the house and Senate, do not sit on the sidelines and allow the few with the most power and stroke to make decisions that will effect you directly without your input. The once proud party of Lincoln and Reagan, which has free-failed into extreme radical extremism, needs to be resurrected. The 2014 mid-term election is a-coming! Get ready to get out the vote.

The children Obama dragged into his anti-Constitution press conference were somebody’s kids too, Christie.  It’s a lot worse to use that kind of propaganda than to point out the hypocrisy of someone saying they are “skeptical” about putting an armed guard in schools while his kids get 11 or so armed guards in their school.  The Congress gets armed guards, the President gets armed guards, the banks get armed guards, the Federal buildings get armed guards, the money gets armed guards, everyone gets armed guards but our children aren’t worth one “resource officer” with a pistol?
It’s increasingly apparent that Christie’s only concern is what he thinks will get him elected and what will make him popular among the social “elites”.  He is going down the same path that John McCain did, he thinks he is making inroads with the Democrats but they will turn on him with a vengeance as soon as he attempts to run for President.

You might have a problem with word association if you see the word cartel and immediately jump to one form of a cartel such as drug cartels.  The question is not whether teachers get healthcare benefits or not, they already have healthcare benefits and there has never been talk of eliminating their healthcare, so that is just a straw man argument on your part.  There may be a question of how much of their healthcare is paid for by the State (taxpayers) and how much by the individual teacher.  You could make a case that taxpayers should pay 100% or you could make a case for something less than that, but that would not mean you were “against education”.

I don’t think the president’s children are any better than mine. My children are as important to me as either Obama or Christie’s children are to them. The NRA had it exactly right. So I assume, it is okay for my children to be in “gun free” zones and possibly be killed because they are not as good as the president or the Governor of New Jersey’s children. It isn’t fair for Obama to exploit his children to make political hay, but keep them under wraps and complain that people are “reprehensible” for pointing that out. I don’t think they are really royal are they?

Stalin used children. Castro used children. Chavez uses children. Kim Ill Sung used children. Mao Sedong used children. Joseph Stalin used children. This is to name just a few of the folks who regularly used children to get what they wanted from the people. Nice company your keep there Mr. President.

Instruments of mass killing.  The fatal flaw in your (cough) reasoning is that you are focusing on the wrong weapon.  Gun control advocates are so focused on semi-automatic rifles, they have tunnel vision. 
 They believe because the guns look scary they are too dangerous for civilians to own and should be banned.  Ban a weapon for cosmetic features?? Features that add nothing to the lethality or power of the weapon??? Insanity!!! 
 Restricting magazines to 10 or less rounds?  So what!!!!!  People can carry more than one magazine at a time, heck, then can carry ten, you do realize that, right???  Round restrictions are absolutely futile!!!!  Why are people in favor of restrictions that mean absolutely nothing – restrictions that will have no impact on reducing shootings?
 So, mass shootings…here are the numbers.  In the past 30 years there have been 62 mass shootings; 988 total injuries; 513 of those injured died.  513 in 30 years!!!!!  More people were beaten to death-728 and stabbed to death-1694 in just one year-2011.  The lives of those beaten or stabbed to death are less important than victims of mass shootings?  Please tell me that’s not what gun control advocates are saying, cause that’s what it sounds like to me.  When people say we have to ban semi-autos because they are capable of shooting many people at one time, they are saying victims of mass shootings are more important, that their lives were worth more, that it’s paramount to prevent mass shooting homicides over the thousands of homicides caused by other weapons. You ALL need to get over thinking that mass shootings are more tragic that other shootings or any homicide.  They aren’t!
More numbers:  2011 – 323 homicides by rifle; 356 by shotgun.  Taken together – 679 – they comprise 8% of total firearm homicides (8583) and 5.4% of total homicides (12664).  What does all this mean??  If you were able to read this objectively, unemotionally, logically you would see mass shootings are NOT common and semi-automatic rifles are responsible for a SMALL number of homicides each year.  Banning semi-automatic rifles and imposing restrictions on number of rounds/magazine is ludicrous.  
 Do something that will actually have an impact; something that will prevent deaths.  Let’s focus on the reasons people hurt each other, the weapon they use is completely irrelevant.  Get rid of every single gun in this country and you will have done NOTHING to prevent violent crime.  You will have done nothing to address the cause, you will have just removed one choice of weapon-violent crime will still be alive and well.
One last point, this is still the United States of America, isn’t it????  We still hold the person who commits a crime responsible, don’t we?  We still wait until a person breaks the law before punishing them, don’t we?  Well……no, we don’t.  When it comes to guns, innocent and lawful gun
owners ARE punished before committing a crime, they are deemed responsible for  crimes committed by others, they are punished because of the possibility, the chance, the thought ‘well it might happen’ that the gun will be used to commit a crime.  That’s wrong!  That’s not how things are done in a free country – that’s not how things are done in the United States.

If people did research they will find all the gun laws

I read my comment and nowhere did I say obama used those words.  He did say: 
 ‘But we also heard from some unexpected
people. In particular, I started getting a lot of letters from kids.
Four of them are here today – Grant Fritz, Julia Stokes, Hinna Zeejah,
and Teja Goode. They’re pretty representative of some of the messages
that I got. These are some pretty smart letters from some pretty smart
young people.’
And also:
“These are our kids. This is what they’re thinking about. And so what we should be thinking about is our responsibility to care for them, and shield them from harm, and give them the tools they need to grow up and do everything that they’re capable of doing – not just to pursue their own dreams, but to help build this country. This is our first task as a society, keeping our children safe. This is how we will be judged. And their voices should compel us to change.’
And then this:
“Julia, who lives in the District of Columbia and dotted the “I” in her name with a heart, wrote that she has four brothers and sisters and “I know I would not be able to bear the thought of losing any of them.” She closed her letter by acknowledging that Obama can’t make all the changes people want by on his own.  “I know that laws have to be passed by Congress but I beg you to try very hard to make guns not allowed. Not just for me, but for the whole United States,” Julia wrote, signing the letter with “my love and regrets.”
From the stage, Obama responded: “Julia, I will try very hard.”
Key sentences:
These are some pretty smart letters from some pretty smart young people.
This is what they’re thinking about.
And their voices should compel us to change.
 “I know that laws have to be passed by Congress but I beg you to try
very hard to make guns not allowed. Not just for me, but for the whole
United States,”
Obama responded: “Julia, I will try very hard.”
Now, DKEL, do you understand the concept of unspoken implication?  Obama brought those kids up there and read their letters to him.  Then he said, “This is what they’re thinking about.  And their voices should compel us to change.”  What else can be inferred except obama believes the requests of those children are another reason we should enact gun restrictions.  
You didn’t answer my question.

Try to remember that we are using logic and reason in this debate.  In which situation do you think the children and staff would feel and be safer:  Being in a school that is in a gun free zone, knowing there is no one on campus to confront an armed intruder, which leaves them completely defenseless, helpless, and praying the police will get there before anyone is shot or killed?  Why would they pray for the police to get there soon?  Because the police have GUNS!!!  Or would they feel and be safer in this situation:  A school that has a trained and armed police officer, security guard, or staff member who is right there on campus, and able to confront, distract, or keep the intruder occupied until the police with GUNS get there?  Do you not see the lunacy in believing a trained, armed person on campus is too dangerous, but hiding and trying to stay alive until the trained, armed people get there is not??






john Doe



Right because being as young as they were I’m sure they had a say in the matter. Like I’m sure there was no hint of a IRS audit against their parents if they did not comply.

Logically children have no place in any political discussion. They lack to ability to contribute anything meaningful to the discussion other than prey on our emotions. Only a scounder uses them like Obama has done

Just to clarify what you said:
Threats of Self-harm. If a patient threatens harm
              against him or herself, there can be ethical and legal justification
              for disclosing that information to a third party if that disclosure
              will help prevent that harm. For example, a physician of a 24-year
              old suicidal patient might advise the patient’s mother–with
              whom he lives–that her son is in imminent danger of committing
              suicide, provided the mother is somehow situated to help prevent
              that harm.
  Endangered Third Parties. Much discussed in the literature – perhaps out of proportion to its likelihood – is the question of physician responsibility to advise third parties about dangers posed by their by patients. Such dangers include threatened violence or infectious disease. It is the consensus of that law that if a physician has reason to believe that a patient in his or her care is highly likely to harm a specifically identified individual, that physician has a duty to make reasonable efforts to warn that individual.
There does not exist a comparable duty when a threat is made against
              society in general or a group that the physician could not possibly
              hope to identify or forewarn. If a patient, for example, swore that
              he wanted to hurt all left-wing sympathizers, there is no duty to
              identify and warn all left-wing sympathizers since a physician obviously
              has no way to identify and warn all left-wing sympathizers in the
              nation.
The extent of a duty to warn is also a matter of debate since it
              is not always clear what counts as a believable threat of imminent
              harm to another. Threats against particular individuals do not inevitably
              end in violence. Some patients routinely make threats of violence
              that do not in fact materialize. For example, an adolescent patient
              may routinely threaten to kill her mother, without any form of violence
              against the mother ever materializing. That being the case, physicians
              are sometimes in grey areas with regard to their duties to report.
              It is also feared that this duty to report will undermine patient’s
              willingness to be open in psychiatric (and other) relationships.
              Some practitioners, however, advise patients at the beginning of
              relationships that they will be obliged to disclose threats to harm.

I think you would have to agree in order for that clinical definition to be appropriately applied, I would actually accept it f it were made by well respecited licensed psychiatrist.  Being a conservative and having now feeling i’ve been duped, largely with regard to financial manners, I will readily admit that it seems both parties are SO greedy that it has drastically impaired their ability to uphold the Consititution and really serve you and I.  They’ve (all of Congress) has let money and power corrupt how they view the divide between  you and I.  I saddens me in general to know this  is the case. We’ve had a lot of bad Republican Presidents, and honestly, I can only think of two in my life-time–Eisenhower and Reagan.  I can only think of two genunuely great presidents on the Democratic side and that would be Truman and Kenneday.  America was duped by the l ikes of Harding, Nixon, Teddy Roosevelt,  FDR and Carter.  Along with that, Congress has let us down time and time again.  Why not remove all of them, they all have their own agendas, and randomly pick people from the phone book to take their place.  That is a serious proprosa that would get us much better quality people.   The only requirement would be the person, whomever, has to be clear of felonies and has to have a job, or had one until this latest debacle.

I think Christie is missing the point.
Point being that guns DO protect children in school and the “O” knows it.
Rosie O’Donnell was the same way.  She only wanted guns for guards for HER kids.
Double Standards.
What is Christie saying? That our kids can’t be targets?
Columbine, Virginia Tech (several times) the Amish Schoolhouse couldn’t possibly be targets?
Christie is missing the point of the valid NRA ad – and all the schools placing permit carry people in schools are NOT missing the piont.
A further point is that Islamist terrorists said long ago that they would target schools next. Has that been forgotten? What needs to be done is find those training camps which are breeding homegrown terrorists and immediately WIPE THEM OUT with whatever means.

When Bush pushed the Partiot Act, you liberals screamed bloody murder, when Obama’s continues and even increases Government’s illegal control, monitoring and Big Brotherhood you don’t care because somehow you think that tratior is going to protect you because you support him.   He does not give one crap about you, only using you, and you fall for it.  You don’t see that the difference between him and JFK is like the difference between JFK and Mao.

“Don’t be dragging people’s children into this,” Seems the governor should be saying that to his buddy, Obama, who had a whole bunch of kids behind him when he signed executive orders related to gun control.
I have felt for a very long time Christie should be a registered Dem since that is his inclination anyway. He obviously is not a Republican unless RINO applies and damn sure is not a conservative.
Governor should be advised of the story of the mother on the phone who told her 12 year old daughter to grab the gun she was trained to use and hide in the closet when a burglar was trying to enter the home when the child was home alone. The guy entered, opened the door where the girl hid and walla….. SHE SHOT HIM. Now that is a kid I would love give a medal to and ‘drag’ to the ice cream parlor for a delicious reward.

The 2014 election is definitely on the minds of anyone who has a brain. Inferring Obama stole the 2012 election is totally outside the box. Numbers tell the whole story! On Taxes as 60% would accept taxes to go up on the top-tiered 2%, 65% on an immigration pathway, 93% black voters, Puerto Ricans 83-17 percent margin, Obama won 73 % of the Asian vote! Obama won 71 % of the Hispanic/Latino vote! Obama won 55 % of the women’s vote! Obama won 67 % of the youth vote! Look at the math! It wasn’t even close!

There you go again! Calling names and blasting without any real knowledge of the real world. Race was not my call, it was the intention of the combative and confrontational TEA-types who have taken over the once proud Republican party. Since day-one Obama has been under attack for anything and everything he proposed:
(http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/inside-obamas-presidency/)
The TEA-types have snookered the Republicans by bringing in other radical types: Evangelical(E), Birthers(B), Libertarian(L) or other fringe sects into what must be a conundrum or consortium of radicals trying to keep America as white as possible. Shucks  – look at the real efforts of the right-winged fringe:
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9TjVsQa57c)
You say it’s my commie agenda and call names like you live next door. You have no clue where I live or how I live and truly shouldn’t try to bring me down to your level. This greedy Congress as you put it are the ones who passed all the taxes, and laws currently on the books. They pass the laws and legislation, the president enforces what they pass and the Courts OK or substantiate the laws passed. Obama has done a fantastic job given the headwinds he’s been up against:
(http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/government-elections-politics/inside-obamas-presidency/the-republicans-plan-for-the-new-president/)
You bad-mouth the president while the majority made their votes count:
Obama won the presidency convincingly. Hispanic voters went for Obama 71% to 27% over GOP candidate Mitt Romney. Let’s look at the numbers. On Taxes as 60% would accept taxes to go up on the top-tiered 2%, 65% on an immigration pathway, 93% black voters, Puerto Ricans 83-17 percent margin, Obama won 73 % of the Asian vote! Obama won 71 % of the Hispanic/Latino vote! Obama won 55 % of the women’s vote! Obama won 67 % of the youth vote! It wasn’t even close! And no one forced anyone to vote for or against either candidate. Any excuse you put forth has been shot down convincingly. And look at what Obama was up against when he took office:
(http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/money-power-wall-street/)
I guess we have to agree we disagree with your thought process – Mine is right on target and I stand on my words!
The once proud party of Lincoln and Reagan, which has free-failed into extreme radical extremism, needs to be resurrected. The 2014 mid-term election is a-coming! Get ready to get out the vote to oust the TEA-types. The TEA-types are out in force in certain regions. It’s going to take work – Now, Let’s get to work – Time’s a wasting!

There you go again! Yelling at me with brazen lies as I do not receive any government assistance I haven’t earned through out my life. And yelling at me like you did prove you are one of the TEA-types I talked about who do not want to have any kind of conversation. Additionally I am not a pseudo elite and I live in Texas, one of the reddest states in the nation. I didn’t vote for additional entitlements, the Congress did! The Congress, as I said before, are the only ones who can pass laws and tax people. They alone are totally responsible for debt ceiling, the taxes we pay and the condition of the economy as it is today. As for the powerful elite, they have done well over the years. Between 1979 and 2009, the top 5 percent of American families saw their real incomes increase 72.7 percent, according to Census data. Over the same period, the lowest-income fifth saw a decrease in real income of 7.4 percent. This contrasts sharply with the 1947-79 period, when all income groups saw similar income gains, with the lowest income group actually seeing the largest gains. In 2007, the top 1 percent share of national income peaked at 23.5 percent. The only other year since 1913 that the wealthy had claimed such a large share of national income: 1928, when the top 1 percent share was 23.9 percent. The disparities of equitable across the board taxation on a percentage people really pay when taxed. Most(98%) are paid in wages of some sort from hourly, salaried, contractual, royalties, interest and other forms on which taxes are levied. Past Congress’s have heavily influenced with money, gifts, trips and other perks to change the percentages or reduce valuations and even charge off expenses to limit tax liabilities on different instruments which brought great return. There are even separate distributions using tax code differentiations like Sub. Chapter “S” and regular corporations to individual proprietary styled companies. Adding to this discussion are those differentiations of income types normally accounted for above the Adjusted Gross Income line of the IRS Form 1040 long form and adjustments below which normally effect the average wage earner up to now proposed $400,000.00. All that aside  and taken into consideration, the rich have at their disposal tax lawyers and accountants who work feverishly to utilize every aspect of the tax code to limit liability of the rich, famous, well-connected or otherwise financially secure. The average wage earner does not have the ability or finances to use great portions of the tax code to their advantage. I invite everyone reading this blog to examine extensively the differences of charge-offs above the Adjusted Gross Income line of the IRS Form 1040 long form and those below. Apply the knowledge acquired to your own selves and then to the black family living in the fifth ward of Houston, Texas on minimum wages. Again, I stand on my words!






IRONSIDE



Your black familiy in the fifth ward pays no taxes.  All it takes is a job at McDonald. The 1040 EZ works just fine, no reason to itemize. I oon’t use any of the forms you mention except for itemization because i  OWN a home and have kids ini college.  Staffords don’t count so that won’t help them, like they are going to college anyway.   No one I know uses tax laywers and if wages went down it was because they stopped working.  I doubt the Texas Synidicate is filing taxes.  You are so quick to say congress passes laws, then why is the muslim in chief passing all the excutive orders?  Why is congress so stupid to pass obamacare to  “find out what’s in it”.  Now we know.  My our of pocket maximum went from 4400 to 8800 in 2012 and I got different insurance before this year.  Now your doctor is going to check you for stability to own firearms.  The top 40% pay ALL the taxes and I use turbotax.  I don’t know what crap you’re talking about except it boils down to the people that voted for Obama voted to keep the freebies coming, and its
going to run out.  If you live in Texas, you should know that better than anyone with all the illegals crossing over that my tax dollars have to suppport and so do yours.  What don’t you get about the way we are being played.  I assume anyone who stands up for Obama is on handouts or just plain stupid.






IRONSIDE



Now tell me obamacare does not raise taxes, just like all the other lies he has told.  And thank God for the 1% as they are the ones doing the hiring if obama wound’t be taxing them an causing them to not lend or expand business due to obamacare.  If the government would stay the hell out of it, we would be doing a lot better for those of us who want to work.  You’ll never get 5th generation welfare rats off the system unless you demand they work for their check.   Both parties are at fault as both parties have had control many different times and the song remains the same, to quote led zep.  If they really wanted to fix it they would have, but greed and money have bought both sides of the ailse.  That is why the Tea Party at least would start out with standing on principles and not have a hand out for a check as soon as they got to DC.  I’m a conservative independent and the only group to make an effort to do things right has been the tea party.  All the left has done is call the honorable GW Bush names for years and n ow p lay the race card when someone, a teal party elected official, yells th is unconsitutional.  Everyone else from Boehner on down on my fomer team and that POS Harry Ried do nothing but clog and distaract.  Amazing how many people go into congress with moderate incomes and come out millionairs.  We all know it’s a house of crooks except for about 20 people.  I apologize for the elitist comment, the problem is spending, not taxes.  and he only people serrious about cutting spending are the tea party.  OBM showed the govt could take 100% of the top 2% and it would last 161 days.  raising taxes is the worst thing, unless it’s tarriff taxes on China and no more free handouts to illegals crossing Mexican border.  let the honest ones stand in l ine like everyone else.  The drung tunnels, when the drons say they are full should be carpet bombed.

I don’t agree with your view Ms. Kearny, “How dare you refer to anyone but democraps as radicals” and here is why. In my view the radicalism and hypocrisy of the far right-wing of today’s Republican Party dominates the rhetoric, image, and policy making of the Party.  Today’s Republican Party is not the party of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, or even Ronald Reagan, none of whom could have won  the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, because their policy positions would have been considered too liberal.  They would have been insulted by calling them RINOs.  The soul of today’s Republican Party has been captured by right-wing reactionaries that push for counter-productive actions like shutting down our government and refusing to pay for debts already incurred by not raising the debt ceiling, in hopes of forcing budget reductions they want.  But in the process they would throw our nation and the world into a deep economic recession or even a depression.  Such irresponsible fiscal thinking is unconscionable among economists, businessmen, and Americans that understand our economy.  It shows a lack of intellectual and rational thinking, and nihilistic extremism.  The Republican Party has largely purged itself of sane moderate Republicans and is destroying a once great political party – Chris Christie, General Colin Powell, Jon Huntsman, Joe Scarborough, David Brooks, George Will, Kathleen Parker, and others are exceptions.
The Republican Party’s image of today is identified with the homophobia of right-wing religious zealots like Tony Perkins and Bryan Fischer; the misogyny of Todd Akin, Richard Murdock, and Rush Limbaugh; the Islamaphobia of neo-conservatives like John Bolton, and Richard Pipes; the selfish self-interest of Wall Street bankers and hedge fund managers, many of whom pay a lower Federal income tax rate than the average American while stashing millions of dollars in off-shore bank accounts to avoid Federal taxes; and the anti-intellectualism and anti-science thinking of Paul Broun, Louie Gohmert, and Michelle Bachman.
This is a Party with voices so radical that they would dare talk about secession from the United States despite the fact that the first Republican President fought and won a Civil War in which more than 600,000 Americans died over the very question of secession.
This is a Party that tries to hide behind the sacredness of our Constitution while at the same time talking about annulling legally passed laws and legislation; overriding legal initiatives by the Federal government; talking of the superiority of the 10th amendment in protecting state’s rights against Federal legislation with which the Party disagrees, despite Article VI Clause 2, of our Constitution, the Supremacy Clause which  “is the most important guarantor of national union because it assures that the Constitution and federal laws and treaties take precedence over state law and binds all judges to adhere to that principle in their courts; and finally by attempting to force specific religious views about abortion,  homosexuals, and gay marriage on all Americans without regard to the 1st amendment guaranteeing the freedom of religion.
This is a Party that passed legislation that blew the surpluses of the late 1990s and passed unfunded legislation that is today driving trillion dollar deficits.
This is the Party that has obstructed attempts to close tax loopholes that support corporate welfare for corporations, while at the same time proposing to privatize social security and reduce benefits for seniors who have already paid for those benefits.  This is the Party that proposed to create a Medicare voucher system that would increase medical costs for seniors.
This is a Party that has obstructed every attempt by the current administration to create jobs and get our economy moving including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 which saved the United States and world from an economic depression, the America Jobs Act, the Putting Veterans Back to Work Act, funding the repair of our infrastructure system, and even voting against emergency relief for states impacted by Hurricane Sandy.
This is the Party that attempted to steal the last presidential election by trying to suppress the vote among minorities and young people that traditionally vote Democratic by limiting early voting and curtailing registration drives in states where they control the levers of power.
This is the Party that has sold out to the NRA and the gun manufacture lobby by failing to recognize that something must be done about the slaughter of our children by automatic weapons, and gun crime in our inner-cities.  Most NRA members want to close the loop holes in gun registration and support other reforms but the NRA leadership and the Republican Party have doggedly opposed reasonable and logical attempts to reform gun laws for years despite the concern and wishes of the NRA membership and the majority of Americans.
This is the Party that proposed and backed policies proposed by its own conservative think tanks, like cap and trade and the individual mandate for healthcare insurance, until actual legislation for these same policies was proposed by President Obama in 2009.  This is the Party whose leaders on the very day that President Obama was inaugurated on January 20, 2009, met in secret to plot how to bring him down and strategized about how to oppose everything on his agenda even if it was in the best interests of our nation. This is the Party that proposed and sponsored legislation to set up a Congressional Commission with the authority to propose serious deficit reduction legislation that reneged and voted in lock-step against that same legislation after it was endorsed by President Obama.   This is a Party that accused the President of trying to be a king because he has proposed 167 executive orders, none of which in any way challenged our Constitution, and even though President Obama has proposed the fewest executive orders of any President in 100 years.  The hypocrisy of Republican Party is evident when despite accusing the President of violating our Constitution and wanting to be a king through proposing executive orders, not one attempt was made to impeach him because the Republican Party knew its allegations were nothing more than hollow rhetoric and would have died in Congress and would have proven immensely unpopular with the American people who understand what an executive order is about.
This is the Party that is today trying to pass legislation in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan that would have thrown the general election to Mitt Romney instead of Barack Obama even though the President easily won all four of these states.  It’s called cheating and that is what it has come to for the Republican Party because they can’t win a national election fairly.  They’ve lost twice to Barack Obama, they’ve lost the popular vote in 5 of the last 6 presidential elections, and lost seats in the Senate and the House in the 2012 general election.  They were able to retain more seats in the House than Democrats only because they gerrymandered congressional districts in key states where they had won control of both houses and the governorship in the 2010 mid-term elections; however, like the presidential and senatorial elections in 2012 they lost the overall popular vote for House members. By gerrymandering districts to favor their candidates they make a mockery of the people’s House where their candidates actually garnered fewer votes than the opposition.
I was once a registered Republican and voted straight Republican tickets for many years.  But the Republican Party deserted me and other sensible and rational Americans when it radicalized itself into the shell of what it once was – a political party that once worked in a bi-partisan way to make America a better and more civilized nation in which to live.
The Republican Party gambled in 2009 by welcoming the Tea Party influence into it ranks and it looked like a winning gamble as reflected in the 2010 mid-term elections.  However, it now appears the gamble  has backfired as noted by the 2012 general election and the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC and other recent polls in which the Republican Party has a 26% approval number while 49% disapprove.  The Tea Party which once claimed 24% of Americans that identified with it has fallen to only 8% according to a recent Rasmussen poll.  The Tea Party’s approval number has also fallen from its high-water mark of 50% to basically matching the current Republican Party numbers with a 25% approval rating and a 47% disapproval rating demonstrating that the American people do not support the radical positions adopted by the movement or its extreme rhetoric.
The Republican Party of today has a far right-wing reactionary streak in it that has split it, caused it to lose its way, and it is destined to become a long-term minority party with its strength centered in the Old South, unless its leadership comes to its senses and recognizes that America is not a reactionary backwater nation, but a great and forward looking nation of people that believe that we are all in this world together and must help and support each other, especially the poorest and most vulnerable among us, instead of a bunch of selfish hypocritical individuals out for themselves in a “dog eat dog” world of economic Darwinism and survival of the fittest.

I refuse to argue with naive people who believe all the government does is good and protective of the people. Jefferson himself warned us about the power of a government controlled by despots and we now see just that.
We never got the chance to read ObamaCare before its vote in congress so am I now to trust those who denied me that right? NEVER!

Is Christy becoming another butt kissing Republican?  He certainly seemed such when he
hung around Obama’s shirt tails begg$$$ for the Hurricane victims.  Does this man have any
dignity?  Christy, is behaving like Colin Powell.  He claims to be a Republcan but votes for
the Dems and “color” like 90% of other blacks.  Shame is hard to find in American politics,
and celebrate the crooks, in the name of forgivness.  What a hell of a country we have
become.  We started that trend when we permitted to poison the minds of our yough when
we allowed radical professors permit one side of a dialogue to prevail.  The other side of an
issue was shouted out and run off the podium.  Our youth are idealistic on issues they know
little about and they are now voting for color rather than positive issues.
Guess Gov Chrisy is a product of such disgrasful generation.  Our country is in trouble in
the people thinking that a “Black intelligent person would solve their problems.  The
opoposite has occrred.  Are the folks, even some of the older ones, so stupid?

Oh how you mimic the likes of Bill Mayer, Soros, Ayers, Dorn, etc. who are the actual radicals that undercoat the democrap party.
I was a member of the ‘Silent Majority’ and proudly proclaim too that I am a member of the Tea Party. I firmly believe in the constitution of the United States and not the one interpreted by you and your gods in the media who represent socialism and welcome communism as a compromise.
I am not homophobic but I am against their wanting equal recognition of their ‘union’ with actual marriage when they should simply request the issuance of a ‘legal sodomy certificate’ which would clearly define what and who they are and the real meaning of their ‘union’, an abomination.

I’m surprised you didn’t defend your Party?  I stated that neither Abraham Lincoln, or Theodore Roosevelt, or Dwight Eisenhower, or Richard Nixon, or even Ronald Reagan could have been nominated in 2012 as a Republican presidential candidate because their policies would be considered too liberal and they would be called RINOS.  I went on to list numerous detailed examples of the radicalism and hypocrisy of today’s Republican Party. Instead of a rational and spirited defense you have responded by trying to insult me and homosexuals.  Be advised that insults are the last refuge of the out-argued?  By the way, for your information, its Bill Maher not Bill Mayer.

You mean you didn’t read the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare?  Did you actually believe people in the media and right-wing Republicans that misled the American people and by telling us it was written in back rooms by Democratic bosses, jammed down Congress’ throat, and passed without senators and congressmen reading it before they voted on it?  Did you actually miss the repeated filibusters by Republican senators of every section of the bill at every step of the legislative process?  It was debated extensively for over a year and the debates were televised on C-Span.  I read it before it was passed.  Sorry you missed the opportunity.  Its still available on the internet if you want to bring yourself up to date about what its actually about.

And that’s why over 80% of the American people are just now finding out all the little hidden secrets.  You going to tell me you knew that obmacare has a provision for doctors to report on whether or not their patients were gun owners?  I don’t buy that for a minute.  The thing is so huge and irresponsible, NO one but the crooks that put it together had an idea what was in there.  NO WAY.






IRONSIDE



and because you say it, it’s true?  Your examples and opinions are your own, not carved in stone.  I say today’s Repuiblican party  needs to go by the wayside and we need a radical revolutionary party to undo what has been done to us since Teddy Roosevelt.






Diane L Kearny



I did watch the debates on the issue and fact is that what is in the bill does not reflect much of what was proposed and what was accepted even by some of the Republicans who argued against such a far reaching medical intrusion which had to be passed in the middle of the night. 
Have you forgotten it was your own socialist, Nancy Pelosi, who told us we had to wait for it to pass before we would understand it.
Will you along with most of the democraps be eager to listen to your hero Bill Ayes when he gives his talk to his fellow socialist democraps. A disgrace for an actual terrorist to be given the dais at a democrat political forum. You must be proud.

Losing what argument? That the democrap party has become the house of actual radicals like Bill Ayes and liars and hypocrites like Biden, Reid and Pelosi?
The libtards attack the Tea Party whom you seem not to recognise as those who are conservatives and who value traditional concepts that are seemingly benign in the progressive/liberal/socialist campgrounds. Or is that to much of an ‘insult’ or ‘name calling’ for a liberal to accept?
Most of those I value are the same people who will be marching to Washington in the protection and voice of the unborn, many of whom were part of the silent majority.
A liberal: would rather keep alive a convicted murderer from a death sentence than save an innocent in the womb.

You’re losing the argument because you haven’t made the effort to re-butt the salient points I laid out in response to your original post to me.  Instead you talk about your support of the Tea Party, the Constitution, your anti-homosexual and anti-abortion views and continue with name calling and insults which is direct evidence that you are losing the argument.  If you’re not going to engage in a thoughtful and rational argument to the points I laid out re-butting your original post to me, just drop it.  You’re wasting your time and mine.






Diane L Kearny



To you anything in opposition to conservatism is salient. 
I refuse to argue with your idiotic attacks but would ask… might you list one suggested law made by Obama that is in accord with the US Constitution. And please do not do the wiggle dance on his ObamaCare. That was and is unconstitutional. 
Congress passed it as a mandate which was refuted by the SCOTUS who then wrongly assigned it as a tax issue when in fact it would never have passed congress under that model and was not presented to the court in the form of taxation which may well have been legal IF congress had passed it that way. But so many democrats had already objected to it being a tax it may have failed to even get out of committee if it had been pushed as a tax. 
The Supreme Court had no right to impose a new standard or change the basic intent of a law under review. They should have returned it back to the lower courts as they often do with issues presented to them.

So you refuse to argue about your own original statement that I rebutted and instead you continue to your avoidance with more insults and name calling.  I think you are at a loss to argue against my points because you simply don’t know how to respond.  The truth has a way of doing that when people are stumped.  Then you challenge me to list one law signed by President Obama that is accord with the US Constitution, which is no challenge at all. President Obama has signed 690 without including the Affordable Care Act which obviously get under your skin.  Then you pretend that you are an higher authority than Congress and the Supreme Court by suggesting that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional.  Really, Ms. Kearny, I think your out of your league challenging Congress and the Supreme Court.  Why you want to challenge me to list laws signed by President Obama that are constitutional is a mystery unless you are totally grasping at straws to somehow validate ego.  It certainly doesn’t make any sense to me, so maybe you could explain your rationale. Of the 690 laws signed by President Obama since he took office in 2009, I’ll list just 125 of them.  Please explain your rationale and try to keep the insults and name calling to a minimum.

Sorry, I find this laughable with the narrative as it stands. The White house began the exploitation and in their ignorant “cookie cutter” mentality they wanted a particular rifle to blame because it looked scary, so they said the shooting was done with the .223 AR Bushmaster. Now come to find out it was left in the trunk and only pistols were used allegedly. So does Newton, CT. have any trained police and Pathologist that can perhaps take over for the ones destroying the forensic evidence and manpulating the media to fit the Anointed Ones agenda based assaults on our liberties?
Now a kid with Aspbergers Syndrome managing all this is of course not very likely, and no medications would no induce, produce, or in anyway have encouraged this behavior in an AS kid or an Autistic. Watch the movie “Rainman” Hoffman portrays the personality quite well. While an AS functions are more conducive to the potential for an indipendent life, Adam had the reported social avoidance issues but the big one for AS and autism is: They will not deviate from the daily structure and schedule willingly, ever. The biggest danger is they will hurt themselves in  a fit when someone attempts to deviate away from their schedule.
I don’t know what happened at the school but I do know with reports of shell casings everywhere there is no way to mistake a .223 from a 9mm or .40 cal. a first day rookie couldn’t screw that up. A liberal propaganda spin doctor threaten folks with thier jobs however…Of course that implys evidence tampering so since we seem to have a lack of Ethical Media, Govrenment, and Law Enforcement operating this narrative. At this point in time so much contaminating the evidence has occured it is beyond any facts being known.
Sad is all it is but sadder still is how little ability there is left for critical thinking in our society. I willing to bet not one in 500 in this country has ever read “Plato’s Apology” but you can name all the Amoronican Idol judges?






Diane L Kearny



Not one of those ‘laws’ (most are basic socialism) would have had the approval of any of our founders. But then they formed a Constitutional Republic and not the USASR ‘United States of America Socialist Republic.
And yes I, along with many others, are smarter than congress and the SCOTUS in regard to ObamaCare (he accepted that name for it in the debate with Romney did he not?) for congress presented a bill under one rule then the court changed it as an accommodation. THAT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL!






IRONSIDE



I mean very clearly you are a liar.  you tell us you read and understand all the ins and outs of obamacare and belittle  those whom you don’t think did as good as a job as you at reasearching the bill  Have you not been watching the news.  It has even been on the alphabet news that one of the provisions of obmacare that obama wants to ensure is followed through on is the provision that doctors are to find out from their patients if they are gun owners and pass that info along to the govt as that are doing with all our medical info on their little laptops each time you go to the doctor.  You did not know that provision was in there?  You been missing the news lately?  I am clearly saying you are a liar when you come across as someone who has read the bill and know all the provisions that even your illustrious senators and conngresswomen don’t know or understand.  It’s all over the internet as well.  Do your own damn research, liar.  Bet you didn’ t know at all your little Indian doctor was reporting your weapons as well as your mental state to have such weapons.  Dufus

So you think not one of the 125 laws I listed that were enacted by Congress and signed by President Obama would have the approval of our founders.  Okay, I challenge you to explain why the founding fathers wouldn’t have approved of each of the following that were listed among the 125:
1. Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013
2. Space Exploration Sustainability Act
3. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012
4. National Defense Authorization Act
5. Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012
6. Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2012
7. United State-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act
8. Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012
9. Combat Methamphetamine Enhancement Act of 2010
10. Small Business Jobs Act of 2010
So you think you are smarter than Congress and the Supreme Court?  This looks like chest-thumping as compensation for not being able to mount a logical defense.  Your rhetoric sounds to me like you and people in the Tea Party are just sore losers.  Wake up Ms. Kearny. The Republicans, the Tea Party, and the far-right wingers were rejected in the November general election by the American people.  This country is going forward with or without you, the Tea Party, or the backward looking radicals in the Republican Party.  The national surveys of the American public also make it clear that the zenith of the Tea Party and the far-right reached in the 2010 mid-term elections, is declining precipitously.  Only 8% of Americans self-identify as Tea Party members and only 26% of Americans approve of the Tea Party, while 47% disapprove. Compare those numbers to President Obama’s numbers.  Seventy-four per cent of Americans like him, and 53% approve of the job he’s doing.  The Tea Party and the right-wing radicals in the Republican Party are way out of step with the American public as they  doggedly hold on to reactionary and backward looking ideas.
I note that you attempt place yourself and Tea Party under the cloak of the founding fathers.  Well, Ms. Kearny, I don’t know how much American history you know, but if you studied it closely, and not the revisionist malarkey of Glenn Beck or other far right-wingers, you would know that the founding fathers and the patriots of that time were liberals.  They were inspired by the great enlightenment era in Europe from which democracy sprung.  The conservatives were the loyalists that wanted to remain in the British Empire under King George.  Jefferson, Washington, Franklin, Madison, Adams, etc. would be horrified by the behavior of the Tea Party and far right-wingers that are trying to move this country backward.
So now don’t take your eye off the ball Ms. Kearny.  You made the statement about the 125 laws I listed that, “Not one of those laws would have had the approval of any of our founders.” You also stated that most of them were basically socialism.   I challenge you to defend those statements; which ones of the ten I listed would the founders not approve of and why?; and which ones are basic socialism and why?  Don’t sidestep the argument like you have done with the issue of “radicalism in the Republican Party.” You lost that argument by trying to change the subject and instead resorting to insults and name calling.  So, again, stick to the subject, step up and state why you think those ten laws I listed would not have been approved by the founding fathers and why they are basically socialism.
Regarding your remarks about the ACA/Obamacare, “….congress presented a bill under one rule then the court changed it as an accommodation. THAT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL!”  Congress did not present a bill under one rule and then have that rule changed by the court as an accommodation.  It is true that the defendants (government) argued that the issue of mandated coverage was covered under the commerce clause and was a fee and not a tax.    But the court’s majority refused to accept that argument. In overriding the government’s argument, the court ruled that mandated coverage was a tax and not a fee under the commerce clause.   Keep in mind it is the court’s job to consider all aspects of an issue and not just those argued by the plaintiffs or defendants.  Just because the defendants made an incorrect argument does not relieve the court of putting forth the correct argument.  Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative justice appointed by George W. Bush wrote in the ruling for the majority, “The Affordable Care Act’s requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax,” and “Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.”  Don’t confuse outcries from the losers in this case as valid.  After all it was a conservative Chief Justice that cast the deciding vote not a liberal.

Hey you dope smoking koolaid drinker, let me let YOU in on a little secret the rest of already know.  ANYTHING that this lying muslim in chief adminstration puts out that even remotely sounds like it’s good for America, had deep within it’s core, a way to destroy us.  God, now much better off we would be if in a flash, instead of all the Christians being taken to heaven, all you commies and socialists would be taken to hell.  Let us have our country back, and the first time anyone thinks communism is the answer, POOF, you dissappear in a puff of smoke.  Just wishful thinking, but in the meantime, maybe we’ll get lucky and while we are defending our right to keep and bear arms, you happen to get in the way of some moron on the left that hasn’t a clue which end the bullet comes out off.

I challenge your response Mr. Ironside.  I have read the text of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), including the provisions to which you refer. You’ll find those provisions under Title X, Section 2717, starting with line 23 of page 2037 and continuing to page 2040 line 2 of the Act.  See http://www.healthcare.gov/law/full/ if you’d like to read the full text of the PPACA or the particular part of the law we are discussing. I’ve copied and pasted the part under discussion below for your convenience.
23 ‘‘(c) PROTECTION OF SECOND AMENDMENT GUN
24 RIGHTS.—
25 ‘‘(1) WELLNESS AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS.—
26 A wellness and health promotion activity imple-
1 mented under subsection (a)(1)(D) may not require

5possessed firearm or ammunition in the resi
6dence or on the property of an individual; or
7 ‘‘(B) the lawful use, possession, or storage of
8 a firearm or ammunition by an individual.
9 ‘‘(2) LIMITATION ON DATA COLLECTION.—None
10 of the authorities provided to the Secretary under the
11 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or an

15 ‘‘(A) the lawful ownership or possession of
16 a firearm or ammunition;
17 ‘‘(B) the lawful use of a firearm or ammu
18nition; or

20munition.
21 ‘‘(3) LIMITATION ON DATABASES OR DATA

23retary under the Patient Protection and Affordable
24 Care Act or an amendment made by that Act shall
25 be construed to authorize or may be used to maintain

As you can see Mr. Ironside, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand that the above language from the PPACA is clearly designed to protect gun owners from the disclosure or collection of information related to the lawful possession of firearms in their home or property;  furthermore the PPACA prevents insurance companies from charging higher premium rates because of a gun owner’s lawful ownership of firearms or ammunition; and the PPACA also guarantees that gun owners are not required to disclose any information under any data collection activity of the PPACA.  This language was inserted into the PPACA at the request of the National Rifle Association (NRA) during the final weeks of the debate in 2010.  See   http://bangordailynews.com/2012/12/31/health/nra-backed-obamacare-provision-restricts-doctors-in-asking-about-gun-use/   The recent flap over this language originated from opposition in the medical community regarding a perception among some doctors that the PPACA language under discussion here limits the right of health-care providers to talk to their patients about gun safety, especially if their patients show signs of mental instability or illness or there is a young child or mentally ill family member at home.  Additionally, as reported in the above cited article, “physician groups and researchers see the provision as part of a decades-long strategy by the (NRA) gun lobby to choke off federal support for studies into firearms injuries.”  However, this perception of some in the medical community is incorrect, as stated by the Obama Administration and included as executive action number 16 in the President’s recent press conference regarding plans to address gun violence.  That action reads “Clarify that the Affordable Care Act does not prohibit doctors asking their patients about guns in their homes.”  Bottom-line there is no PPACA requirement that doctors request information about guns from patients that they (doctors) judge may be at risk to themselves or others, nor are doctors prohibited from doing so if in their judgement it is appropriate – its the doctor’s’ call, not the Federal government’s.  I have noticed that some conservative websites and conservative media personalities have distorted this issue for self-serving and partisan political purposes making the awkward stretch that number 16 means that doctors will be required to ask their patients about guns in their homes and then report that information to the Administration.  You have also made that leap of illogical thinking; however, you and the conservative media are wrong.  See http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2013/01/16/regime_deputizes_gun_snitch_doctors   A simple reading of the PPACA language above debunks this kind of thinking and talk which is nothing more than an attempt to spread a false perception of the PPACA, the President’s executive actions, and to confuse Americans by obfuscating the true intent of the pertinent PPACA language.   See http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2013/01/16/regime_deputizes_gun_snitch_doctors executive actions on gun violence.  Additionally, this is a rather stale issue as it has come up as long ago as 2009 and as recently as March, 2012.  See  http://www.snopes.com/politics/guns/medicare.asp

Hey disckus you suck.  left wing moderators for a right wing  blog.  don’t surpise me.  hell you are probably UN.  That’s ok.  we’ll see who wins the next one.






IRONSIDE



only an idiot or treasonist would expect anyone to accept whatever is written today, to apply tomorrow.  go take a nap.






IRONSIDE



snopes has been proven to be a left wing shill.  not surprised you referenced them.  Soros owns them.  drink some more koolaid and we’ll catch you on the filp flop

Forget snopes.  Keep your eye on the ball and stop trying to change the subject.  This dialogue is about your portrayal of the protections for gun owners built into the PPACA.  I used the actual language from the PPACA to prove you wrong.  And your rebuttal is calling snopes a left-wing shill, that Soros owns them, and telling me to drink koolaid?   Avoiding the issue and trying to change the subject when you’ve been called out is amateurish.  I don’t suffer fools when I know what I am talking about, and now its clear that you have no clue about the text of the PPACA that refers to protections for gun owners.  Time to man up, Mr. Ironside.   Defend your false portrayal of PPACA gun owner protections, or admit you were wrong, or just shut up and go away.

Get a grip Mr. Ironside.  You’ve lost the argument that language in the PPACA is designed to have doctors ask their patients about guns they possess and then report it to the Federal government.  I quoted the actual language in the PPACA  and sent it to your to read and gave you the exact reference.  Then your respond by calling me an “idiot or treasonist.”  Very weak Mr. Ironside.  Insults and name calling won’t help you in winning arguments.  Reasoned and rational thoughts backed up by real evidence is what wins arguments.






IRONSIDE



No one disputes what it takes to win real arguments.  I hope you sleep nice and comfy believing you accomplish exacly that.  What I know and believe in my head and heart is that not one piece of legislation, information or simple speech that comes from the left is honorable, moral, Constitutional–let alone honest.  Trying to come off like your some kind of expert on BS legislation I imagine is what you elitists do.  I could care less about anything that comes from the mouth of the muslim in chief, his two faced idiot VP, the lying b**tch that is Secretary of State who murdered 4 Americans or the house and senate full of blithering idiots.  Truth is not name calling and when we have taken our Country back in whole, or cut off whatever you progressives want to practice your king or God complex that will be called Karma.  United Arab  Emerits had more balls than we do.  And a factual statement would be that only an idiot would support sending advanced military supplies to Egypt and continue funding a country that just passed a constitution that calls for Sharia and the subjegation of the female gender.  I  would think you libs would be all over that, but I guess you are showing your real colors in that what is obviously more important is the advance a palestinan state and the destruction of Israel.  Go blog on Huffington post or snuggle with Chris Matthews–it wouldn’t be such a waste of your time as trying to actually think I would believe one word written in anything the muslim in chief signed.    I mean really,  you must be whacked out.






IRONSIDE



it seems to me you should shut up and go away.  Nobody asked you to come on here with your false information–and again, because it is in passed legistation (we have to pass it to know what’s in it) does not make it true.  Just the opposite.  you and all your left wing friends on here should spend your time  badmouthing America at some cocktail party at Princeton and allow the Americans who still believe in the Constitution to discuss our views on the state of the union.  You don’t find us stirring the pot on your sensless blogs, but of course your marching orders which you all follow to a t, is to come to sites like this to see how much disruption you can cause.  don’t you get it?  You lefty commies do not warrant a sensible conversation becaus liberal and sensible is an oxymoron.  What happpens when your gun shows up on the list Feinstine wants to ban?  You’ll just hand it over just like you will welcome the blue helmeted devils to go around and confiscate.  hell, you probably volunteer to help them.  You impress me as a go along to get along type of person.  Certainly not one who will stand up for your rights so many have died to protect.  Lefties go away.

Mr. Ironside, I’ll be answering both of your recent posts in this single post.  To your notion about how I sleep, I sleep very nicely and very comfortably, knowing that I have interjected the truth in the dialogue about the PPACA and gun control.   I see that you have apparently dropped the issue now that you are aware of the truth. I also see that you haven’t yet learned to get beyond insults and name calling.  You keep coming back with the same old insults, name calling, and irrational blustering.  You’re even using the same terms like “muslim in chief.”  Sorry you’re having such a hard time with my calling you out on your insults and illogical thinking.  By the way, Mediaite is not a conservative news site just for name callers and insulters.  Its down the middle so back off with your idea that nobody asked me to come on here with my rational thinking that is getting under your skin.  As I told you earlier, I don’t suffer fools when I know what I’m talking about.  In one of your most recent posts, you opened up a new avenue of discussion when you wrote about cutting off progressives that practice a King or God complex called Karma.  What does the Law of Karma have to do with your allegation that progressives practice a King or God complex?  What kind of Karma are you referring to – national Karma, individual Karma, institutional Karma or what?  And what will the Karma reaped by progressives be like?   I’m posing questions to you from a metaphysical viewpoint and not the pop culture stuff.  Your portrayal of progressivism as practicing a King or God complex makes no sense, Mr. Ironside.  Progressives or liberals are not and have never been into Kings.  The King complex belongs to conservatives who have down through history defended the status quo and the Godly right of Kings to rule.  It’s the liberals who fought for freedom, equality, and democracy, not the conservatives.  A good example is the loyalist conservatives during our Revolutionary War who supported King George and the British Empire against the liberal patriots of the time.  That’s right, the liberals that initiated a revolution and designed a democracy that changed the world – like Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Adams, Paine, and Madison.  Men who were inspired by the liberal revolution in thinking brought about by the Great Enlightenment in Europe – liberals who changed the arc of history and fought the conservatives of the time who doggedly tried to hold back the freedoms and equality that the people wanted, but Kings and the establishment were loathe to relinquish.  And God complex, well that would also be conservatives, especially in religion down through time – priests and religious theocrats who allied with Kings and Emperors giving them God-like power to control and rule the people.  Perhaps you are not aware that the roots of modern conservatism were a reaction against the French Revolution where the French conservative establishment feared they would lose their opulent life style, as the people revolted against the despotic rule of the King and royalty.  The conservatives gained back their power and got another Emperor.  Perhaps you have heard of him – Napoleon Bonaparte, another megalomaniac, despotic, dictator responsible for thousands of deaths through needless wars of conquest.   Perhaps you aren’t aware that the underlying philosophy of conservatives throughout history has been the impulse to defend power and privilege against movements demanding freedom and equality.  Perhaps you aren’t aware that all right-wing ideologies and movements from the 18th century through today are historical improvisations on the theme of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back.  We see that happening today in the space of barely four years as the Tea Party movement rose to heavily influence the Republican Party and reached its zenith of power with the mid-term elections of 2010.  Since then right-wing conservatives and the Tea Party have been in decline and  dragged down  the Republican Party to the point where they lost a Presidential election, lost seats in the Senate and House, and only held on to their majority in the House through skillful gerrymandering of congressional districts after the 2010 census.  Now the conservative right-wing and Tea Party are desperately trying to hold on by threatening to primary Republicans they see as too liberal.  Rational Republicans are now referring to the Tea Party radicals as the looney fringe (Steve Schmidt) and blaming them for changing the Republican Party brand into the stupid party (Bobby Jindal).  The spectacle of the Tea Party trying to claim the mantle of our liberal founding fathers is ridiculous, intellectually dishonest, and show their ignorance of history.  The tools of this movement have been resentment-filled talk-radio blowhards and religious zealots who are anti-science, anti-female, homophobic, and Islamaphobic.  The movement is made up of numerous contrarians who have little depth of knowledge or insight into history, governing, or reality.  They promote a neo-conservative foreign policy of unilateral interventionism, bellicose arrogance, and utterly irresponsible environmental hooliganism of nations.  A foreign policy that was responsible for two unpaid for wars, one of which, the pre-eminent invasion of Iraq, killed over 4,000 Americans and 100s of thousands of Iraqis, and was totally needless and based on  nothing but speculation about WMDs.  No wonder the American people have rejected the Tea Party, neo-conservatism, and far right-wing conservatism.  You go on “that only an idiot would support sending advanced military supplies to Egypt, a country that passed a Constitution that calls for Sharia law and subjugates women.”  Fortunately we have leaders that have a larger and more insightful view of the world than what you are expressing, and understand that even though our nation may not endorse everything that goes on in sovereign countries like Egypt, we have a responsibility to honor our treaties and obligations.  Those treaties and obligations with the government of Egypt provide us with influence in that part of the world and to abrogate those treaties and obligations would jeopardize the safety of our strongest ally in the Middle-east, Israel.  If we were to suddenly back out of our treaty obligations because we don’t like what the Egyptian president and the Islamists are doing as a sovereign nation, it would lead to alienation and seriously deflate the influence we exercise in the region giving President Morsi and the Islamists the excuse to end the non-aggression pact with Israel and no longer recognize Israel’s right to exist.  It would also be seen by Egyptian seculars and Christian Coptics as tantamount to abandonment and alienate them as our natural friends in Egypt.  Keep in mind that it was President Morsi pushed by President Obama who recently intervened in Gaza with Hamas to implement a cease fire between Hamas and Israel, end the needless killing on both sides, and stop the rapid descent into a possible war that would inevitably involve us.  Do you really think it is wise to play such a high-stakes game, alienating the Egyptians and heating up already tense relationships in that part of the world? Do you really think it wise to chance the closing of the Suez Canal cutting off the primary transportation route of oil from Saudi Arabia to the US resulting in $6 per gallon retail gas prices plunging the US into another recession?  Think long and hard Mr. Ironside, because these are the real issues that are on the table.  Knee jerk reactions to a sovereign state’s desires to write its own Constitution and practice whatever religion it wants is the height of irresponsibility on a grand scale.  Regarding a Palestinian state, it may interest you to know that a two state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is long standing US policy with both Democratic and Republican administrations.  The United States as the primary economic and military ally of Israel has long sought a two-state solution as the only road to peace in the Middle-east.  Don’t fall into the neo-conservative trap that a two-state solution would lead to the destruction of Israel or the argument from the Israeli Likud that the only way to guarantee Israeli security is to expand Israeli settlements into  the Palestinian West Bank and deny the Palestinian diasporas the opportunity to return home after decades of exile.  Both sides are currently entrenched in their positions.  But if there is ever going to be a peaceful settlement and the avoidance of continual tension and potential war in the region with worldwide ramifications, cooler heads and long view thinking toward an independent Israel and Palestine with mutually beneficial economic relations is the only answer. So how about it Mr. Ironside, are you going to respond to this post with more shallow insults and name calling or engage in a rational dialogue?  If all you’re going to come back with is more insults, name calling, and no rational or reasoned dialogue, don’t bother.  You’ll be wasting your time and mine.

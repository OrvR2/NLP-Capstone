I really wish Good luck to Beyoncé when she will perform today! It will be soooo much better this year than last year. Last year's "performance" was a fucking disgrace, i can't believe they allowed that talentless old joke﻿ to even "perform". it was really embarrassing to see her trying to dance :( But I'm sure Beyoncé will do great! :) But MJ's performance willl always be # 1.

umm, are you seriously﻿ saying that about Madonna? She's a legend, she's the queen of pop, and according to the Rolling Stone, her performance was the best superbowl performance ever. It actually got the highest viewed performance ever, with 114 million people watching. It was amazing, i don't what ur talking about.

For all you complaining about the lip-synch, it's not like he allways lip-synched. He mostly sang live. It'ss﻿ normal that artists lip-synchs during occations like this as they can't check out everything and perfect the sound.
MJ is globally known for being and exeptional live artist. Watch any of his tours (well, except from HIStory as he suffered from laryngitis).

It isn 't bad for Beyonce, Madonna, Justin or anyone who tries to reach the King's shining, not bad at all. And probably some day, Michael's Superbowl performance will be overshadowed by a more modern﻿ one...It is just that it is not going to be Michael 's....It has been acclaimed as legendary, and it was in every sense

Dude your a fucking asshole! He never molested any children you idiot. He was investigated by the FBI for 17 years and they didn't find anything. Get out the fucking bubble. Oh and when you've been performing your whole life since the age of 5, the last thing people are concerned about is him lip-syncing. He's proven himself not﻿ only as one of the best vocalist ever, but the greatest entertainer of all-time. Show some respect to a legend bitch!

HE NEVER MOLESTED THE CHILDREN?? and I guess you﻿ are the one who's not living in the bubble, right? Then the idea of a 49yo guy having white kids sleeping on his bed it's not disturbing in your books, is it? Oh, wait, bcos if it's MJ to put some kids on his bed at night that's NOT weird at all, he's a humanitarian.... and if MJ lipsynchs it's not bcos he doesn't have the talent to sing live it's bcos he doesn't have to prove he can sing. Do me a favor, retard, your legend is the MOST OVERRATED

So you saw in tv that he﻿ molested children and you believed that. I never saw the face of any children not an interview nothing. But I guess there's no point arguing with someone who always believe what media presents. That's how they keep us ignorant... but wait If it's on tv it must be right! THATS LIVING IN A BUBBLE, But reality is that there was never a real investigation about this allegations.

no, IDIOT, I see that it's not fucking normal for a 50yo man to play with under age kids on his bed! Do you really want to pass that as a NORMAL BEHAVIOR?? Or maybe we should think that mj was a humanitarian and not a pedophile. LOL!!! When you have millions like mj used to... you can buy people's silence ( LIKE HE DID PAYING FOR THE BOY NOT TO SUE HIM) and you also﻿ buy your innocence.... Like OJ Simpson did!! The reality is that MJ was a pedo and that he was doing a lot of PLAYBACK too LOL

So now you dictate what's normal behavior.There's a difference in playing with children and a improper touch.The rest of your "facts" where never proved in court like you mentioned he paying the boy. If you﻿ repeat what your local network tells you it's ok but there is not factual information involved here or can you smartass show something?As far as the playback thing well like you said he had nothing more to prove by that time his body of work speaks for itself

Michael had weird like much other﻿ stars but nobody could prove anything against him not even the fbi if you think you know better you should apply for a job there. Every artist who sings a message against the status quo is charged with some weird drug accusation or something like that. Or found mysteriously dead. It doesnt have to be even an artist, watch Julian Assange just around the time that he revealed wikileaks to the world they mysteriously accused him of rape.

u must be talking about that WHORE of your mum. u know what's funny? That when it's britney spears doing Playback it's bcos she has not talent but when it's MJ doing playback it's bcos he's a genius. Even more so, when it's MJ putting white kids on his bed that's bcos he is a humanitarian but when it's a random 50yo old guy it's bcos he's a PAEDO. Can you not take the first train to destination FUCK YOU CUNT!@!?﻿ Piece of shit like you are the scum of society. Get a working brain, fucking idiot.

but that'S the opinion of an uneducated retarded piece of shit like you...and the opinion of an uneducated retard doesn't really count, you know. If this was one of the best then why nobody seems to give a﻿ fuck﻿ about it in the recent polls? Is it bcos MJ was doing the SAME routine again and again and again.....???? Yes, good but we've seen the same shit from him before..... he never evolved. That's why he was past his time till he died. He was going to repeat this b4 dying. NOTHING NEW.

NO, WAIT!! Are you saying that MJ is not lip synching here??? and I should trust that you are right when you say that it's NORMAL for a 50yo guy to sleep in the same room with a bunch of white under aged kids? So, AGAIN, it's genius when MJ does playback at the super bowl but then the other doing playback﻿ have no talent? And it's fine when MJ plays with kids in his room but then if it's another 50yo doing that then he's creepy??? No peado at all.....and live singing... lol.

I'm not saying anything about lip sync, it is not normal, mj was a 50yo guy with a fun park in his house (of course than is not a reason﻿ to tell he is innocent), if you lip sync in the super bowl I would put my tv on fire and I would throw it away and my previous comment still stands.

OMG he was soo gorgeous...that was his regular voice he was speaking in but he said in an interview that most times he liked talking a little higher because it was less strain on his throat...Im just curious how they got the audience flipboards that made the children so perfect...there﻿ wasnt anyway to rehearse that...that was amazing...but then everything he did was amazing...thank you Michael for the healing and love you brought to our world..we love you and miss you so much <3

That's because they have technology now to tune the audience out so you can hear the performance. The same stuff they when they film an artist's concert﻿ DVD. So the audience probably was much louder for Madonna's performance but you could only hear stage sounds. Not a Madonna fan just saying. :-)

At one time it almost was like Michael Jackson was Jesus... meaning worshipped like him! The Illuminati destroyed his Image, no one will﻿ ever be that BIG in the Music Industry ever again!

Who cares? When the black eyed peas performed they sang live, and it sounded HORRIBLE! Most artists lip synchs at the Superbowl, cause it's such a big event and they're most of the﻿ time asked to lip synch to not mess anything up.

Michael's performance was THE REASON I watched the Super Bowl in 1993. He set a standard (yet again) that no one else has eclipsed. Jackson is a truly great showman and performer --- expanding to fill whatever space is available, be it auditorium, concert hall,﻿ or stadium. His artistic excellence, love and respect for fans, and for the world will stand forever.

This was the last superbowl of the 4 straight years my Buffalo Bills lost. I remember screaming at ass hole Troy Aikman﻿ and even my guys. This was the best dam halftime show to date. Michael made me feel (back then) that my boys were gonna play it to win it, but Emmit Smith and Michael Irvin stopped all that noise. Sad day this day was. I miss ya Mike. The worlds hurt and unhealed without u.

Wow thanks for sharing, I never knew michael did the super bowl, that was in 93. I cant michael still looked so young and vibrant there, times flies. I just cant believe he is gone now. Michael had a good soul, anyone that got a chance to meet him and be blessed in his presence said he was a real nice person. He helped a lot of people in this world with his﻿ fame and his music. He wasnt selfish or boastful like many artist today. he wanted to make the world a better place. He is forever a legend

@jacques panikkassery joseph I feel pitty for it too and﻿ I'm IN it. Ugh. Justin Beiber and all these new celebrities that think they're so fantastic. Michael shaped it all. If it werent for him, think of all the artists that would be screwed over woth no inspiration.

You're clearly a delusional faggot. The reason this superbowl 1993 got the HIGHEST views ever, was because of Michael's half time show.﻿ Truth tea for you, faggot.

Justin Bieber is still young. He deeply respects MJ's﻿ talent and ambition very much and I admire that kind of ambition in the kid, and I say this as a lifelong huge MJ fan. Besides, somebody's got to try to come close to the best in this generation and I like that Bieber is at least attempting it.

there is no one in pop music today, not usher,﻿ that justin kid, none of the who had what jackson had or can do what jackson could do. not only that , but there isnt even anyone who comes close, not even close. everyone tries but its pointless. micheal jackson was the greatest showman there ever was. before him it was elvis but micheal jackson took it to a level that will never be seen again. seeing micheal through your tv was just as exciting as it was to see him live. no one else can do that

Oh God I wish I was born earlier so I could have had a chance to be part of Michael's era, now I am stuck with fake bitches and boys wannabe men - not mentioning any names - but you can probably guess who I am talking about. Although I think Whitney Houston's Superbowl performance was﻿ the best as it was so touching and emotional. Both gone and missed.

UR BOTH WRONG. PRINCE DESTROYED BOTH PERFORMANCES LOL!This performance is great don't get me wrong.But this sounded like any other MJ performance and not that much different than the studio version.And madonna didn't even sound live and was to over the top. Prince changed his songs﻿ up a bit, Played the guitar like a boss,AND SOUNDED LIKE HE WAS SINGING LIVE. Besides Prince's performance was special.He played Purple Rain in the Rain.It doesn't get more iconic than that.

My God, I remember watching this (How I miss my childhood). This﻿ was the only reason why we all watched the Superbowl. I had no idea that this halftime show was going to set the standard of every future show then on. And, till this day it is consider the best ever.

Ok so hang on.. If you were told﻿ all these accusations about you... And had the money he had, would you not fight tooth and nail to clear your name, and then not sue all those people that made the stuff up and get your money back?... Like I said before, no smoke without fire pal... But I will admit he did make some good tunes!!!... It's just my own personal opinion, of which I am entitled too as are you :)

That's stupid saying. There are plenty of ways to get smoke without fire. Stick a pan on a stove﻿ and turn it on full blast. You'll get smoke well before you get fire.

I think cannabis should be legal. What gets me is the anti gun views form some people who support intoxicants. A lot of people think drugs and alcohol are harmless and an "assault weapon" is a killing machine. However intoxicants kill exponentially more people than "assault weapons", look at the Carrollton Kentucky bus collision. As I said I think alcohol & pot should be legal, but I also think that sets a standard, and by that standard "assault weapons" are not a big enough problem to be banned

What happened to her is tragic, as are all mass killings. And people have no right to say the horrible things they do about her. However, it's not wrong to disagree and argue your point in a polite respectful manner. If some one paralyzed by a drunk driver said we need to ban alcohol, what would you say? "Assault weapons" are only responsible for about 50 deaths and 60  injuries per year, why ban them?

Look up the sten gun, they are very simple and can be easily made. Plus a lot of semi automatics will still be legal, so some one would probably just make a magazine, which is even more simple. Also prohibition was about 80 years ago, I think law enforcement has advanced since them. Of course there would be some violations, but there are with all laws. However I don't want an alcohol ban, I'm just saying if we set a standard with an AW ban it's the logical thing to do.

Why is it that the ruger mini 14 tactical is listed by name in the ban, but the standard mini 14 isn't? The only difference is the stock and flash suppressor, do these features make it easier to kill? I don't want a high capacity magazines ban either, but an "assault weapons" ban just doesn't make any sense at all.

You say that gun owners are "immune from facts". But when some one says that we need to ban "assault weapons" over 50 deaths per year, then I say that 3,000 innocent people die because of drunk drivers per year, they seem to be "immune from facts". "Assault weapons" are not very dangerous, so why do we need to ban them?

He killed all but 1 with a .22 rifle, so unless all guns were banned this still would have happened. In fact less then 1% of homicides would be affected by an "assault weapons" ban.

"Violent Video Games Alter Brain Function in Young Men", read this study from Indiana University School of Medicine. Studies do show a change in brain activity from violent media. Could these changes be more significant in the mentally ill? I think more research is needed. Couldn't it be argued that Firearms are the scapegoat? Beyond all of that, mass killings are rare, and will probably never go away. I think the best thing we can do is stop giving them so much attention to prevent more killing

As said I don't believe we will ever face a tyrannical US, but lets talk  hypothetically. The US has been in Afghanistan for over 10 years, so if your implying that we would be easily wiped out, I disagree. Many would die, but the gov doesn't have enough drones to watch us all, many in the military would defect, we would most likely eventually get aid from other countries. I think small arms, rifles ect. would be enough to hold out. Again I don't think there's a chance of this, but you asked.

I voted Obama and I'm glad I did. But I don't support an "assault weapons" ban. I'm a gun enthusiast, I don't need one for defense it's a hobby. I don't think they should be banned because they only cause about 50 deaths per year. If we are going to ban "assault weapons" because of 50 deaths, then we should ban alcohol because 3,000 innocent, (sober) people die every year in drunk driving crashes.

According to even Senator Feinstein an "assault weapons" ban will only stop about 50 deaths per year. This is a majorly publicised minor issue. I can't  even imagine the pain of the victims and families of mass shootings, but I feel the same about a person who loses some one to a drunk driver, and I don't support a ban on alcohol. An "assault weapons" ban is a big solution to a small problem.

We can't take all guns, and as far as an assault weapons ban I don't think it will work. Charles Whitman killed 14 people with a hunting shotgun and a bolt action rifle in 1966. Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people in the Oklahoma City bombing, to my knowledge he used a similar explosive to the one James Holmes had. I admit some lives might be saved, but as I said before there are only about 50 mass shooting deaths a year as it is. We could do other things that would save more lives.

I assume your being sarcastic. The first gun I shot was an ar15, the fact is it's a lot of fun to me and many other people. Before you say something like, "your fun isn't worth lives", think about alcohol, 3,000 non intoxicated drunk driving deaths a year. About 50 to 70 mass shooting deaths a year. If you want an "assault weapons" ban okay, as long as you demand a ban on alcohol as well, or else your a hypocrite.

There are many insensitive conspiracy theorist lunatics out there. They are some of the most disgusting people on earth. I truly can't even comprehend the pain of the families and survivors. However I don't think an "assault weapons" ban is the right move. There are 3,000 innocent, (non intoxicated) drunk driving casualties a year. Every sane person feels compassion the victims and families, and suggests making it difficult for the wrong people to get it and increasing penalties.

Do you want to ban all guns? I assumed you meant an "assault weapons ban". My figures were based on an AWB. If you want to ban all guns, then I guess your right, but McDonald v. Chicago says you can't. It's alcohol vs "assault weapons", not guns. As I said before 95% of murders have 1 death, some one doesn't need an ak47 to do that, or even the 4% of double murders. 1% of murders would be affected by an AWB, I do support background checks. I don't want to ban alcohol.

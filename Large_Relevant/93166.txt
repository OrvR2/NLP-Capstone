A smart, articulate debater can talk someone who can't think for themselves that the sky is any color but blue. Saying something is one thing and not the other does not make it so. Creationism is an unproven hypothesis based on a belief. Evolution is backed by hard, thoroughly examined, physical evidence. I think I will go with the Occam's Razor choice here.

Oh, that is because the questions and the answers were probably filmed at different times. You can tell also by the quality of the video recording. Quite often when people do video interviews they only have one camera so they first record the interviewed party with their answers and later re-record the interviewer asking the questions and edit them together. I expect that is what happened here.

Most if not all of these shootings happened in 'gun free zones'

The UK has 3 times the rate of violent crime than the US.

In Australia women are 3 times more likely to be raped.

The 2nd Amendment was written so that the gov't would not have a monopoly on force.

Freedom exists when gov't fears it's people, Tyranny exists when the people fear their gov't.

Average police response times are about 7-10 min. 

Average time for me to grab a weapon 5 seconds. 

You don't want guns, don't buy them.

The FAA obtained a legal interpretation in June 2011 that found shining a laser pointer into an airplane cockpit "could interfere with a flight crew performing its duties while operating an aircraft, a violation of Federal Aviation Regulations."

49 USC § 46318 - Interference with cabin or flight crew

As a professional pilot I wholeheartedly agree with throwing a very large book at violators. Pointing a laser at an aircraft endangers lives in the air and on the ground.

You're welcome. I realized that it was not what you were asking but I felt the need to pass on a little education. Now regarding whether or not they should be legal; The purpose of the 2nd Amdt is to make sure that gov't does not hold a monopoly on force, with that in mind ask yourself whether or not fully automatic weapons should be legal.

Tyranny exists when the people fear the gov't. Freedom exists when gov't fears the people.

Don't worry so much about the sheep turning in their guns as they don't understand the reason for the 2nd Amdt so the guns that were in their possession were useless, rusty dust magnets.

A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the﻿ right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
All gun laws are Illegal as they are an infringement any other interpretation is an excuse for government powers to grow & liberty to fade. Stalin Total gun ban "Real power comes from a Long rifle." Leader of China who killed 70 million of his own people, Mao zedong "Every communist needs to understand all political power grows from the barrel of a gun

The bad ones get guns any way as they don't obey the laws or are physically capable that it doesn't matter.
Surprise Surprise Surprise! doesn't work as well﻿ as you think.
Less are killed & it prevents government abuse of the people in tyranny & genocide so yes it is worth it.
That is your baseless opinion I have historical evidence to prove other wise.

And making good people believe﻿ that buying guns is a good defense, while bad ones get many easy guns to attack them by surprise is good for your work. Few armed wolves make a big difference! "Mass shootings have been stopped by armed citizens"... no matter that some are killed by disturbed people (who they avoid?) with easy or terrible guns. As a presenter would say, what a ridiculous argument! God bless people there, because depending on many foxes like you, many more will be killed/injured.

Nope criminals avoid those who﻿ can deal with them. they seek victims not conflict.
In the Drug trade conflict with each other is unavoidable & that is where most of our gun violence comes from But you have been shows The facts that prove this before & still you Whine we should all Roll over & die on command. Mass Shootings have been stopped many times with armed citizens so that is not an excuse to be helpless. Few wolves around? God your stupid Making good people helpless does not Work.

And you? Do you have less guns in the hands of criminals? Probably we don't have 7% of the guns you have circulating there. And besides "fed" criminals you still fear armed citizens around, not only in mass shootings. Is this defense? Who are the sheep thinking they are wolves? Your shepherds can't even react well because all the possible wolves around are armed even with scary guns and no matter﻿ what time they arrive, it's always late for most sheep. Better to be sheep with few wolves around!

Zero options? We have the best option: much less people with guns intimidating and shooting. If 30,000 people in a small town have guns, it's because they feel unsafe; your society has created this﻿ feeling. And why? Few attacks etc in the country? We have many small towns where most don't have guns and have no interest because people don't feel unsafe and crime rates are low. It's the same in most towns of middle class in the world, as I said. Most here don't live oppressed by other ones around.

You keep selling criminals are﻿ Masters of ambush & nothing ever go's wrong with their plans lol! Sorry life is not Bubble Wrapped Scathing happens. Zero options are not better than having an option.
As demonstrated with 30,000 plus individuals owning guns in Kennesaw Georgia & the Millions per state carrying guns your assertion of chain reaction Mass shootings is false.

So, continue selling the idea that most people can defend themselves unscathed in surprise attacks, can never react causing a﻿ shooting near you and are able to deal very well in any situation with criminals and attackers, who also get guns easily, but no problem. Pray that "a few scattered failing individuals" discover, between so many people who want to buy guns only with intention of defense, the ones that could have their guns used to attack. Who knows mass shootings etc. disappear...

You "Imagine" a lot & have no facts.
I never said we had less risks only that we are able to deal with them as adults & not cattle to be protected by a few scattered failing individuals.
You/ good citizens of Brazil out number them you can train to shoot well to work as unites & larger cohesive forces all you lack is belief in yourself & permission from your masters.
The Propaganda puff piece that after 40 years your government is "Winning" the war on drugs & crime﻿ is just pathetic.

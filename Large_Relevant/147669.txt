"Why do you NEED assault weapons?" I ask, why do you need cars? Why do you need airplanes? Why do you need cholesterol? Each of these kills more people than guns. ﻿ You don't need them. Just like you don't need freedom of speech, or freedom of religion, or freedom from illegal searches and seizures, or protection from self incrimination. The point is, we are not limited to utilizing, experiencing and owning things things in this country based solely on NEED. We have freedom of choice here.

ANY Gun ban is illegal. We have a right to bear arms which shall not be﻿ infringed.
Obama is clearly infringing on that right and is attacking our rights GUARANTEED under the second amendment.
This not only Anti-American & illegal but also Stupid...!!!!
I don't own any guns, but now I will arm myself because a tyrannical government is now in place. The US Government is OUT OF CONTROL, Impeach and Recall your congressional representatives while you still have a voice.

"Disarmament must happen at a time when overall trust in government is high, and under the guise of safety for the people, or perhaps the children. Knowing that any government,﻿ no matter how idealistically started, can become despotic, the Founding Fathers enabled the future freedom of Americans by enacting the second amendment." -Ron Paul, 2008

This is﻿ actually a misquote, and Ben Franklin wrote this within quotations, making it the words of another man. The original quote is "Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." The right to own assault weapons with high capacity magazines isn't an essential right, and isn't needed for self defense. You have "the right to keep and bear arms." That does not mean that you are entitled to ALL firearms.

You guys aren't listening. He said the banning of assault rifle-type guns. Logically, why would an everyday citizen even NEED these weapons? A pistol is enough to keep you & your family safe. There needs to be regulation in serious matters, such as guns﻿ that can be used to injure/kill people. Large guns are unnecessary & dangerous, especially if they end up in the wrong hands, eg the case at Sandy Hook. If the mom hadn't been a prolific gun enthusiast, maybe her son wouldn't have gotten to them.

What you don't understand is handguns are used in about 68% of the murders in the US and assault rifle type weapons﻿ in less than 1%. Why are they wanting those banned? They clearly aren't the issue.

Rifles are rarely used in crime according to the F.B.I UCR. NO matter what laws you pass, criminals will get their hands on them, just look at Mexico﻿ they have a very strict gun law. As much as it pains me to say you will never stop these shootings from happening. the true purpose of the 2nd Amendment is defense from foreign and domestic threats, including the federal government. these "Assault weapons" help the common law ABIDING citizen to defend themselves.

The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the﻿ militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms, and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose.

He﻿ will fight and repeal the 2nd Amendment the more crazies that kill people with guns...so, what about drinking driving issues? ban alcohol too? FDA drugs kills 100,000 people yearly ban all FDA approved drugs as well.
He don't give damn about no constitutional rights...he extended the patriot act and had Brandon J Raub arrested for speaking out against government they detained him for 30 days in the psychiatric ward.
Someone is bribing the president...

Agreed. Signing the patriot act when he said he wouldn't. Hes by far the biggest liar/worst president that has ever served. He also﻿ said he loves the 2nd amendment and wouldn't take away guns.

To all﻿ those saying they still haven't heard a solid reason why we "NEED" assault rifles : I'm sorry why do you NEED a car that goes over 65 mph? Why do you NEED﻿ alcohol over 80 proof? Because our right to purchase and use fast cars, alcohol and firearms RESPONSIBLY, trumps any reason to restrict them just because we don't need them. You're acting like its a privilege to own or do anything and that the government reserves the right to take it away at any time. Disgusting.

How do I respond to this. Yes you are correct more﻿ people here are killed with fire arms then other places. more people are stabbed to death in places with out firearms. Places with firearms have less crime then places with out them to. (statistics are on the FBI website its cool I know you dont want truth just emotion so i dont expect you to look)
Final point.
The rights of the people shall not be infringed. So good luck.

I'm assuming by your complete﻿ abundance of time that you are probably still single and have no life but for hypothetical reasons let me ask you this. What are you going to do if a man armed with a gun or knife breaks into your house to rape and murder your lol *cough...excuse me...girlfriend, wife or child? The answer is you're going to do nothing because you can't protect them. So what you do is hope it never happens to you. I hope that works out for you. Men defend their families. You can't.

"If there's anything we can do to keep our children safe...." the just of what follows is, remove your form of protecting your children, because no murderer is going to brain your﻿ child with a baseball bat. Shut the hell up NObama, your ideas and opinions are just that, and they aren't helping America.

were talking about NOW, because gun control is happening NOW. You seem to have serious issues getting past what happened in the past. The world doesnt work like that anymore. The fact is that last year the police had to fire 85 bullets﻿ total in germany, when you can find multiple individual incidents in the US where more bullets were fired across a few hours.

You're the one﻿ that was bitching about the natives being killed, fucking idiot. Stop being so hypocritical. No, there is no record for how many times they shot.
Making this shit up makes you look stupid, and a lot of cops prefer beating than shooting there and everywhere else. And no, never will you find that. Again stop making shit up and exaggerating to demonize people.

they dont have a lot of the protections? how come they dont need a﻿ gun. How come needing a gun becomes a part of freedom for you rather than oppression, like everyone else sees it as? germanys censorship of music and other media is roughly as stringent as americas.... You people think your constitution makes you a free nation yet you are easily as contained as the rest of us.

In China people get stabbed, beaten to death, prosecuted and killed by commies every single day along with getting shot. Violent crime is gonna keep happening regardless of whether you ban guns or not.
Cars kill﻿ people too, much more frequently, would you like to ban cars?

Are you fucking stupid? There is no constitutional right to succeed from the nation. Maybe you should go back to a middle school history class so you can sound intelligent.﻿ Also English class to learn proper spelling and grammar.

Hey hey, maybe you need to go back﻿ to even before middle school and have your parents teach you manners again. I remember learning at some point in American history about the right for states to suceed the union, mind to refresh my memory? Plus this is the internet, stop making a big deal about grammer ffs.

Because the people in the United states are one of last remnant of truly free people. Taking the guns away will make them much﻿ easier to control in a more tyrannical approach which is evident now by police force the and the confiscation of guns after Katrina.

Gun Owners have a Fruedian complex. There is absolutely no need for assault weapons outside the military. Also No need for more than 1 bullet. You﻿ NRA dopes need to read the constitution. Trust me No One in the 1770's could have foreseen the insanity that is going on. If You want an assault rifle for your gun case then you don't get a firing Pin.

Why is there no need? Prove it, don't just make blanket claims. One bullet? I'm sorry, that's just ridiculous. Why would you possibly think that? In the 1770's the people had access﻿ to the same firearms the military did. Just because technology progressed, does that mean one group should be left behind? And please study the history of firearms. The 18th century had cannons. Go further back and take a look at the Hwacha, able to fire 200 arrows at the same time. All of them on fire.

What fantasy world do you live in? Hitler took guns, stalin took guns, Mao took guns. Before they did this the people thought their leaders were going to take care of them. MILLIONS were sacrificed due to idiots like you. This wasn't 250 years ago either. There are still people alive to tell the stories.

The NRA was made by the GOVT for things like this XD they bleed it dumb ass. You obviously need to read it, because it's clear﻿ you have not. And they did, they knew. Things like the puckle gun were made before the United states was founded.
And it was a Gatling gun, from what I remember around 60 rounds in 7 minutes, and of the time. That is faster than what we see today.
And semi autos, and fully autos were being testing in the late 1800's The did not see internet, or phones. BAN THEM!!!!!!

An excellent question, sir. Firstly, let's clarify that the term "assault weapons" used in reference to semi-automatic firearms is a misnomer. For a firearm to be considered an assault weapon, it must have select fire. This means that it can fire full auto or semi-auto. Now that that is cleared up, I have many uses﻿ for one. I can protect myself from attacks on me, my loved ones, potential attacks from other countries, or oppression from a tyrannical government, if need be. Thanks for asking.

Obama only personally answers the talking points. This case the talking point is gun control, the President of the United States of America has no﻿ time to spend on insignificant petitions made for the purpose of shifting attention away from gun violence. Btw. Im a fellow airsofter and member of the armed forces just sick of the apparent lack of logical thinking anymore.

"The purpose of the war was to finally realize the Hamiltonian dream of a consolidated, monopolistic government that would pursue what Hamilton himself called 'national﻿ greatness' and 'imperial glory.' The purpose of the war, in other words, was a New Birth of Empire, one that would hopefully rival the Europeans in the exploitation of their own citizens in the name of the glory of the state." - Thomas DiLorenzo, fr. "Malice Toward All, Charity Toward None: The Foundations of the American State"

When your right to bear arms indirectly lead to killings of innocent and gun crime and violence,﻿ then that right should be suspended by the state. Complete disarmament of the people is the correct way to proceed towards a safer and more civilized society.

How would the same apply to us? We know our land more than they do, we have 2000 times more people with same guns. It's impossible for them.

Yes! You have to remember that our military is made up of our citizens. I'm a recently separated veteran and the majority of the people from my unit have issues with the governments policies. If they were then ordered to fire upon their family and friends and neighbors, do you really think they would do it without question? No. They'd take all their weapons and equipment and fight back against the oppression. Use your brain and learn﻿ before speaking.

You are forgetting that the military ARE Americans, most would not do such a thing. A military coup would happen if any such orders were given. The same with confiscation of firearms, they wouldn't do it, and the government knows it, that's why there is not even a word mentioned about confiscation. Look, I don't know where your from and what﻿ you believe, but about half of the US is tired of the government being brown nosers, and the other half enjoys the new socialistic side of the government.

You're an idiot. "Regulated" in the context of the constitution means disciplined or trained. It does not mean "subjected to government scrutiny."
What would be the point of creating a constitutional protection for firearms,﻿ but then limiting that protection in the very same amendment?
Before you call someone a "knuckle-draggin', window lickin' jackass," you should probably know what the fuck you are talking about.

What the founding fathers meant by a well regulated militia, was for﻿ the people to constantly train and be sufficient in using their firearms. Just in case they needed to fend themselves from any threat, whether it be a foreign army or their own government. They also said when they try to take them from us it's the time to use our weapons on them.

When the soldiers and cops give up their assault weapons, then and only then should the rest of Americans feel safe to do so, too.
If you don`t think it`s﻿ troubling that people who already have overwhelming authority over citizens will be the only ones with access to heavy fire-power, you haven`t been thinking hard enough.

Actually there were 59 gun related murders not just shootings. However I﻿ was talking about great britian having one of the highest violent crime rates in the world with 2,034 per 100,000. That's higher then most countries in Africa. We only have 466 per 100,000.

is this a real question?i will admit, a gun is useless without human intent. but a human with the right tools is more dangerous then one without. im not advocating a total gun ban.﻿ but i think its a matter of public safety that the public should have a right to know who amongst them is carrying what kind of gun. and many states already put you in a database the moment you buy high capacity guns(wrong term?) but not others. it makes for a haphazard system. it needs to be implemented better.

The public has no right no know anything about any other person that they do not wish to be made public. Whats next? You "need" to know what color my underwear is? You need to know what kind of bottled water I drink? When you use the﻿ term "high capacity", please define what you consider to be "standard capacity". How does knowing what kind of weapons I own make you safer? All it does is make me a target for someone looking to steal a new weapon and forces me into violent confrontation.

would be like arresting someone's twin for a crime the other twin committed. The AR-15 is not an assault weapon. The M16 and M4 designed for the troops are fully automatic rifles and are already illegal in the US. Please educate yourself before jumping on the bandwagon. Guns are dangerous, but in the right hands they save lives. It is not the guns we need to go after, it is the mental illness and doing a full background﻿ check before permitting the sale of a weapon.

According to scientists, conservatism is the greatest hindrance for human progress. Change is inevitable. Humans try desperatly to control their enviroment, when we should instead be adapting and learning from it. With a strong social security system, cheap/free healthcare and education, the amount of violence and crime WILL go down. But it would seem like any kinds of steps towards socialism gets all you americans freaked out and calling everybody a﻿ communist.

Sick to see how the media has completely used this tragic shooting to further their own agenda. It's not enough that they hype up the shooting and turn the killer into some kind of diabolical celeb. Why don't they focus on the tragedy of dead﻿ children rather than the deranged man who killed them, or even the TOOL he used to kill them. Media has messed up the way we view these situations. Viewing the tool as more important than families.

Mr. President, I﻿ cannot understand why common sense is not being used here. Do you realize that stricter gun laws WILL NOT prevent criminals from getting guns? If they want to use a gun to commit a crime, then they will obtain it on the black market.
Why should law abiding American citizens be penalized for the acts of a few mentally unstable people?
Additionally, the areas with the strictest gun laws, have the highest violent crime rate as seen in Chicago & the UK unlike Switzerland.

Obama is a liar and is purposely trying to destroy America and so far he is doing a pretty good job of attaining his goal. If everyone was armed and dangerous things like Sandy Hook, in a state with strict gun laws, would never happen. This is double speak out of his mouth﻿ and he has been waiting for an opportunity to infringe on our 2nd amendment rights since before he was elected. Conservatives have been right about him all along.

Your children are protected by one of THE most highly trained ARMED guards in the WORLD ... How dare you sit there and preach while you MURDER children around the WORLD ... CNN estimates﻿ you have killed at LEAST 176 kids in YEMEN and PAKISTAN .. You are a blight on human kind because most believe in your " ethics " But you are a LIAR and worse off you are a killer. I was SOOO happy when you got elected , I thought the nation was going to grow and get out of the killing game .. I was wrong

The USA has NO RIGHT to bomb pakistan , especially with loose rules that don't even identify the people being bombed. How would you feel if you knew that this man killed 21 women 3 days after﻿ he took office ...A drone strike he approved that resulted in MASS MURDER ... WAKE UP man .. killing people no matter of how you feel about their religion is the ONLY ethical thing to do .. These people aren't hitler .. They are muslims ... You don't kill a woman and tell her you are her liberator ...

It is sad that so many Americans feel the need to own a gun in order to protect themselves against possible violence.... it may be﻿ the logical thing to do on an individual level and i'm not going to argue against the constitution.... but sad nonetheless for such a great country

I was not trying to make﻿ a comparison with the UK which also has a crime problem. However drugs and petty crime are not the same as violent crime and homicide. The latest intentional homicide figures published by the UN show 4.8 homicides per 100,000 people while the same figure for the UK is 1.2 . Even so I myself think the UK has done a poor job in preventing crime. Instead I look to countries like Singapore which is effectively free of violent crime

Look I did say that gun ownership was logical on an individual level and if I was living in the US I would probably own a gun for self defence especially given how many other﻿ people own firearms... My point was simply that as a society it is sad that violent crime is still a fact of life even in countries like the US

All americans own weapons ... END OF STORY .. EVERYONE owns a knife, or a bat , or a hammer or a screwdriver ... Weapons are EVERYWHERE in ALL societies around the world..... The reason people kill one another is what should be talked about here ... Thousands of americans kill one another WITHOUT guns every year ... Even fists and FEET kill more than rifles do... FBI stats 2011 ..﻿ Homicides by rifles 323 ... By hammers and blunt objects .. 480ish .. By HANDS AND FEET 726 Look it up

Yes I agree with you... the violence is the issue. My point was simply that if so many americans are purchasing firearms for self defence then the threat of violent assault must be a legitimate concern to them﻿ which in itself says something worrying about society and that is the real issue here.

Rifles were used in a total of 323 known homicides in 2011 FBI statistics... According to CNN Obama's drone policy has killed between 1500 and 2500 people in countries that the USA is not even at war with. There are weekly drone strikes in regions of pakistan that are terrorizing families . They estmated in the Universirty study that 176 children have been killed in Obama's﻿ drone program.... THIS MAN HAS NO BUSINESS telling ANYONE about saving children ... Jeremy Scahill has a video on here

Dear Mr. President, I completely agree that we should improve child safety & prevent mass murders! You implied multiple times that magazine & rifle bans would assist in accomplishing this worthy goal. Every single piece of data from government sources says that what you propose will have zero effect. Would you please direct someone, anyone, in your﻿ offices to provide data & information to support and validate this claim? I would like to ensure that what gets done actually improves child safety.

The purpose of the war was to finally realize the Hamiltonian dream of a consolidated, monopolistic government that would pursue what Hamilton himself called 'national greatness' and 'imperial glory.' The purpose of the war, in other words, was a New Birth of Empire, one that would hopefully rival the Europeans in the exploitation of their own citizens in the name of the glory of the state." - Thomas DiLorenzo,﻿ from "Malice Toward All, Charity Toward None: The Foundations of the American State"

Go look it up my friend ... CDC and﻿ FBI statistics ... Direct liver failure is around 15 000 per year and drunk driving another 12-15000 PER year .. multiply by the length of time since 9/11 and you have at minimum 300 000 over the last 10-11 years.... You'd be amazed ... Falling ... Seriously FALLING killed 24 000 last year ..and around 120 000 died of all accidents combined ... HUGE numbers ... rifles ??? 323 murders ...

The U.S. is experiencing a 50-year-low in murders nationwide.
In 2011, the U.S. murder rate was 4.8 per 100,000, the lowest since 1963, when the rate was slightly lower﻿ at 4.6 per 100,000.
While last year wasn't the lowest rate in our history, it is near the low end of the range over the last 100 years. The peak homicide rate in the recent past was in 1980, when the murder rate hit 10.2 per 100,000.
Why do we need more gun control? Long gun registration was a failure in Canada.

Hey you goddamned son of a whore. You are a criminal thug﻿ responsible for countless needless deaths of innocents. You keep your fucking hands off our freedom. You are not a dictator. There will be far more deaths caused by your illegal intrusion into our liberty than could possibly be saved through such an act.

I know people like you consider guns like Linus blankets to cover their unsecurity,﻿ but honestly just the fact that tools whose only scope is to kill are more important than the lives of 20 kids and people care more of them than the deads ... make this country a morbid place to live. The fact that you buy a gun it means that you want to use it. It's the symbol of mistrust and fear, it's the opposite of building, friendship and community ... IT'S TYRANNY AT ITS BEST.

You provided nonsense hyperbole from a media outlet with an agenda. Its true﻿ I buy guns to use them.... to hunt deer and fowl, shoot paper and steel plates, and keep "just in case" in the same manner one keeps jumper cables or a box of band aids. Its also a symbol of freedom. I don't know where the mistrust and fear comes from... I can only assume you are projecting.

What kind of asinine statement is that? If you are a 100lb woman and a 250lb comes along and decides to rape you, how do you suppose you are going to defend yourself? Suppose someone breaks into your house and decides to help themselves to anything they want, including your life, how do you suppose you are going to defend yourself? Your statement is not congruent with the way of humanity.﻿ A firearm is an effective tool for securing freedom.

A firearm is an effective tool for giving a﻿ much greater advantage to the first person that gets that firearm in their hands, whoever they may be.

You've obviously never studied history. The founding fathers of this once-great nation didn't pacify the oppressors of the﻿ time into granting freedom, they shot them. Never needing a gun is nice, but living in a world so delusional to think that possible is not healthy.

I haven't studied American history. I'm not American. It is most Americans of today that are delusional, thinking that easily available guns make them safer. They don't and the figures show﻿ it.

You "studied" us? You don't live here or have any experience with us or our culture (beyond what you read on the internet or see on TV) and you feel qualified to make those kinds of statements? Do you have any idea how much of the Earths surface our country covers or what 307 million people are actually like? Each state is almost﻿ its own country with vastly different cultures. Why are so many people murdered in Chicago but not too many at all in Irvine? No offense but you don't know...

Sorry I misread your have vs. haven't. All the more reason anything you say regarding "most Americans" is completely baseless. How can﻿ you make a statement about "most Americans" when you freely admit to knowing nothing about us? Even more to this point is this that you acknowledge the vast cultural differences between large areas. So, now knowing this, any statement you make about us or our firearms culture carries no weight. Online != real life. Don't compare the two.

The products are different the history is different.

Yes, the state were all Europeans and Asians dream to come to for not only it's best snow, some of the greatest native history, Ute, Paiute, Goshute, Shoshone, and Navajo tribes. It's wonders of the world (Arches and Moab)
It's weather, it's people, it's rights, and one of the most safest states. As﻿ well as having some of the highest graduating CTE scores and classes of this nation.
And from seeing how you people think, of some European countries as well.

Not to mention local dialects, dominant religion, common morality, bushiness ethics, etc etc. This is precisely why the Federal government needs to stay out of making sweeping laws. Obama is a Chicago politician. Chicago is a crime ridden place under mafia influence. I know it well. It holds the record for the most politicians convicted of various felonies. This is where Obama is from. What does he know about﻿ Sprint, TX, Perris, CA, Eugene, OR, or Mooresville, NC?

I'd also add that I think we are doing pretty well as humans who learn by example and considering the leadership in this country solves all of their problems (real or imaginary) by bombing the crap out of them. Over 200 Middle Eastern children have been bombed to death by drone strikes on Obama's watch... The citizenry is far more tame than our so-called "leaders"﻿ and our glorious dictator.

Most of Americans are delusional? Stats show that other countries with strict gun control, while they have less gun crime, they have hundreds of times the violent crime rate of the US. Taking away guns doesn't make people less violent, it makes criminals have easier jobs. Please find me a figure that shows taking away guns makes people safer. (Here's an idea. Walk ANYWHERE in﻿ a city at night without any weapons on your person and see how safe you are. Now make that same walk with a gun and see)

2.5 million people use﻿ guns every year to protect themselves from violenc. Do you want to be the one to have to comfort a family or individual that was not able to protect themselves at a critical moment and gets assaulted or killed? Are you going to be there to provide protection for them when it really matters? Or are you just going to say how sad it was and how someone should have done something about it? I would not take your right to defend yourself so why do you insist on mine being taken?

But the "loons" already have guns. Even if they didn't they would have knives, or bats, or bricks, or anything else that could kill you. And thats just it, their intent to kill. I'd rather have a superior tool to defend my life with and the tool I choose is a firearm. At any rate, your opinion doesn't even matter, we are granted the right to bear arms by our creator and the government has﻿ the standing order of "shall not be infringed". Simple as that.

Getting rid of them is not an option besides the fact that doing so would result in hundreds or thousands of casualties and possibly a civil war. Will, who never studied American History﻿ and is from the UK thinks Americans should get rid of them.

Oh and here is another thing

US: 466 per 100,000 people (Over all crime)
Freedom﻿ is being free, if you really live in a nation where thinking "slavery" is free, you guys need a better mental health care. (I'm not saying you do, I'm just exaggerating)

'These figures are misleading. Levels of police recorded crime statistics from different countries are simply not comparable since they﻿ are affected by many factors, for example the recording of violent crime in other countries may not include behaviour that we would categorise as violent crime (for example, two people seen fighting in public, even if no one is injured).
'Violent crime in England and Wales has fallen by almost a half a peak in 1995.' (Two years before the ban on guns).

That's not a crime to yell at someone. Wow 1995!?!?!?!?!? After the biggest gun sell of the united states our crime rate has been lower than 1960, and is even lower now than 466﻿ out of 100,000
These are not misleading facts 2,037 per 100,000 is 100% accurate. I don't know how that when you hear true facts you think they are bull.
I don't know if you just can't accept that or what but it's true.

You were claiming not long ago that the UK and America couldn't be compared per capita at all! What happened to that?
You can't compare 'violent crime' there's no set definition and different countries will﻿ class different things as 'violent'. Anything caught on CCTV in Britain which fits the definition will go down as violent crime. Smashing a window for example. Even if nobody claims.

Why do you think I quoted slaves? Do you know what it means when people quote things? And normally when things are free and cheap it's not good quality health care.
There is a reason things like insurance, the more expensive﻿ the better you're served.

It's free at the point of delivery because it's paid for via taxation. It is not 'cheap'. Male life expectancy is 2.5 years longer for men in the UK than in the﻿ US. Check the numbers..

If you're paying taxes for it, it's not free. Unless you do not have to hand then even a penny. Than yes, it's free.
So? That's not with everyone. It's not because of your mental health care.﻿

Didn't﻿ mention Puerto Rica..learn to read..They are NOT part of and kingdom or empire.
If they are then America is still part of Britain, Canada is still part of Britain. It's stupid and wrong.

I meant are, you think that if they are currently part of the Spanish kingdom, how could they have been later British Empire? Hmmm, little things like are and were can make a huge difference.
Common wealth is what I believe﻿ they are a part of, and we will never be a part of your slave country.

No, it's not a part of north america, it's considered a sub continental area. Sovereign countries are like European union, just because you live in costa rica, does﻿ not mean you belong to north america.
It's the same with EU. It never was and never will be part of north america. I'm guessing you're going to agree with him and all those countries belong to the US?
Now I'm guessing you're going to tell me because the US owns Danish west Indian island, that means the US owns Denmark now XD

        Canada the United States Mexico Guatemala Belize Honduras Nicaragua Costa Rica Panama Is all that would even come close to being North American, not the Caribbean island. Look people think Denmark is part of North America﻿ now because he have one of their islands. If you look, it would be on there, but that's not correct. If you down to central america, they will and say it's a sub Continental area. South will say the same. And few in the north will. And out of every European just 1.

I also don't believe it is a coincidence. So, here I am, a normal productive citizen who enjoys owning and shooting these misnamed "assault weapons" who is not on any meds nor wants to ever kill anyone, has a job, pays my (unreasonable) taxes... and the president and his cronies want to take away my freedoms while at the same time passing out these mind altering drugs like candy...﻿ the same drugs present at every massacre. Tell me again how it is a gun problem?

I'm not a drugs researcher, a doctor or a pharmacologist so I don't think I can comment on which drugs should or shouldn't be prescribed.
What I do think is that the mass shootings﻿ of little children and the grief of the families, outweighs the enjoyment and pleasure that you get from owning and shooting these weapons. And that if a ban on these weapons saves just 1 child, it is worth doing.
Do you not agree with that?

The same "family member" Who grieved over the kids were stage actors and the attorney for the batman shooter (Which was given the drugs he mentioned.
It will not save these children, if anything it will kill more children. Like it﻿ did in the UK with that extra 35% gun crime rate increase.
All shootings are at gun free zones, where I guess you can say guns are banned.

I absolutely do not agree with that. My guns have not killed anyone. I have not killed anyone. I do not plan on ever killing anyone. So to say that I should give them up because some child might die somewhere is completely false. It makes no sense at all. If﻿ this is about saving childrens lives, the CDC states that over 700 children die from drowning each year. Shall we also ban water? (for the sake of consistency... saving lives) My freedom is not up for debate. Its already protected.

That doesn't surprise me. You are in the UK with a completely different culture. No offense but there are very few people in the U.S. who care about what someone in the UK thinks. We broke away from your country for a reason. We felt so strongly about it﻿ we killed many of your people to secure our freedom. In the history of the world, that wasn't all that long ago.

Conversely, a madman breaks in someplace with a knife and starts slitting the throats of﻿ small children. Someone with a pistol (or carbine for that matter) has the advantage and could stop this person. Even in Sandy Hook, you cannot deny that had a single armed person been there at the start there was at least the POSSIBILITY that the rampage could have been stopped with force and children could have been saved. This is a more valid and realistic argument.

It is possible. But not a single mass shooting (4+ people shot in one location) has been stopped in the last 30 years by a civilian using a gun.
Do you accept that it is very likely that fewer children would have been killed had he﻿ not had access to "assault weapons".

Uhm, you are completely wrong about that. The recent mall shooting in Oregon was stopped by someone with a concealed weapons permit. It doesn't make national news because it doesn't further an agenda. It has been reported in their local media. Recently in Tennessee, in a school that has armed security, an armed nutcase was stopped by the armed security lady. It happens all the time, nobody reports on it because it doesn't serve the﻿ leftist/statist agenda.

Also, no, I do not accept that fewer children would have been killed "had he not had access to assault weapons". For one,﻿ its a factually incorrect statement. He had no "assault weapons". Second, he was intent on killing people, he would have found another way. How many children can you run over with an average sedan with a full fuel tank (highly explosive I might add)?

I used "assault weapons" because you earlier used "assault﻿ weapons". I haven't seen a single case of someone intentionally running over children in Britain or Japan or Australia etc. Have you?Can you find a case?

The point of Obamacare is to lower prices for healthcare. Your viewpoint is "liberals literally want to destroy America they are the bad guy conservatives good good good" is kind of troubling. Have you ever﻿ tried looking at an issue free of bias from whatever your party tells you to do?

I gave you FACTS. Actually 34,000/y is the average number of gun deaths.
665,000 is the number of people killed in any war fought by the US in his history ...﻿ while 1,075,000 is the number of people killed by guns in the US is the last 30 years.

The US is not the only place, EU do it more I would say. When you mention anything about guns, no matter what, and never mention where they own guns. All Europeans I have ever met says something similar to.
"United states is the most dangerous country"
Or "It's all because of you gun tooting idiots, you should ban all guns dumb ass"
Or "The only reason you guys have high crimes is because of guns, change that you dumb ass,﻿ this is not the rambo cowboy age. Guns are murderers and you are to"

I'ts like when people us US instead of United states. EU maybe something quite different than Europe, but I just use it because (EU)rope.
The only much I know are things like Switzerland is not part of EU (I think that's one of them) because you live in Europe does not mean your part of EU.

I barely know anything about it other than it's base in Brussels, and something about commissioners of﻿ each states to put higher interest than their own country.
Then European parliament (I think that's right) And council
Here in the US if you're not in AP or honors they don't really teach history -_- That's efficient enough to actually have geographical knowledge equaling others.
What's it there in the UK with geography.

I'm sure they don't give a fuck whether someone shot them with a﻿ firearm or ran them all down with a truck while they waited for the bus, or were lined up walking home.

The point is you can easily stop children being shot with a firearm. I haven't seen any mass runnings over in the UK before or since they banned﻿ guns.

No, you cannot easily stop these kinds of﻿ events. Banning firearms will not miraculously make them unavailable to criminals. Once again you are full of holes.

I have both Italian and American citizenship. I lived in Italy, UK,﻿ France and the US and worked in 50 countries including all the Scandinavian countries, Germany, Switzerland, South Africa and Canada. When I lived in Europe, I was never scared of bullying, people fight with words and exchange opinions and points of views. yes there is violence but not at the daily rate and at the personal indifference level as in the US. Since I live in the US I have level of anxiety I never experimented before

Argentina attacked first the Falklands, killing British troops. Britain then repelled the attack﻿ and reclaimed the islands. I'd hardly cause that an obsession with war and guns.

Perhaps if you actually looked at the numbers﻿ and how things are done outside America, you'd realise that what you've been told isn't always so.

My house has a population of 2 it's completely valid to compare.
No, it's not valid, it's no where near valid.
IFine, I'll use "Watcjhwilldocoolstuff" Logic, since US was the﻿ first to land on the moon that means it's owned by the US, and since it has no people on it it's the safest planet. No crimes ever. Since population does not matter with comparison
It's a valid argument to compare land with 0 people to one with 2 million.

Now apparently math does not exist either, and that it's impossible to divide. Hey idiot. 311 million divided by (5 actually) Would equal 62 OY MEH GOD RELLY?
Yes .25 is less than .40 but here is the thing. Gun crimes don't even have a valid comparison to deaths and crimes in general.
Love how you people are always using gun crimes as if those are the only crimes that exist, and are the only important﻿ ones. And you have more of that (In a both equal comparison)

Until what point, unstablement (I know not even a word) My point is that population does effect Per capita, and my point was you can't compare two countries with.
1. Massive population difference
2. current war/drug problems
3. Location.
UK is surrounded by water, harder for drug cartel to be coming in and out﻿ fast, you have barely (Comparison) any people, you don't nearly have a corrupt leader.
You can blame the shooter all you want. (Continued)

There is certainly a large population difference, however once you get past a certain point the difference is virtually irrelevant. The UK and the US are both well past that point. Also worth﻿ pointing out that every single US state has a higher gun homicide rate than the UK. Both have drug problems
current war/drug problems

(I did not check up on this one, so you can if you want) And all those crimes you see are majority from California, Michigan, and Tennessee, the poor gun control states.
That's what is the problem, this country as an individuality, no it is not the most﻿ dangerous. But as a whole, it does have more, but it's only because of those 3 states.
US is like Europe, (Or all continents) Why compare US with a country (Lets say UK) instead of US and EU.

Every﻿ single US state has a higher gun homicide than the UK. Do you not see how this completely ends your argument? I BEG YOU to check the figures so we can end this.
Please do.

Hahaha, not they are not even close to being higher XD Since you can compare UK to US, I can validly compare Vermont to ALL of﻿ Europe and and all the property of the British empire.
Population does not matter after all right?

Are you serious? Vermont, which you mentioned, has the second lowest out of all of the States at 0.48 murdered per 100 000 people.
The UK has 0.04 per 100 000. EVERY SINGLE US STATE HAS A HIGHER GUN MURDER RATE PER 100 000 PEOPLE THAN THE UK.
AND AMERICA IN TOTAL HAS﻿ A GUN MURDER RATE 92.5X THAT OF THE UK PER CAPITA.

That's all murders. We're talking about gun murders.
If you want to talk about all murders, the figures are below:
The UK has a murder rate of 1.2 per 100 000 people. Totalling 722.
America has a murder rate of 4.8 per 100 000﻿ people. Totalling 14 748.

Fascist..really? I'm British we were the first country to stand up against Fascism and﻿ we were virtually alone for over two years until the Russians and Americans were forced to join in too when they were attacked.
It makes a difference how someone is killed because we are talking about gun murders..obviously...

Yeah, you're a fascist. It's an ideology. You're just too ignorant to know what it is﻿ which you have embraced. Ask the families of the victims if it matters how their loved one was murdered. You're assuming the murderer wouldn't simply choose another method. You cannot make that assumption.

Ask the families if they want their relatives to be murdered at all. Banning guns will save lives. Some murderers will choose another method. But murder becomes a lot more personal, difficult and time consuming when it isn't done by pulling a trigger. And standoff situations where both parties are armed﻿ won't happen.

Violent crime will go up as the weak, the elderly, and the infirm fall prey to criminals. All in all, your position does far more harm than good. Besides, if what you say is true, then﻿ why are the murder rates so high in Mexico, Russia, Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia to name a few. They all have gun control. Your argument dims in the light of the truth.

Because Mexico, (Russia not so much), Brazil, Venezuela etc. are all corrupt, second rate countries. If you look at established, wealthy, organised democracies like you find in Europe and Japan, Australia. Countries which are equal to America in standards of living,﻿ comparisons show the truth.

You﻿ don't understand what per capita means. That is obvious. There's no way I can discuss this properly with you until you learn what it means.

I've given you the numbers, I assume you have checked and﻿ agreed with them because you haven't questioned any of them. Most crime in the UK happens in the big cities too. I think there is little difference there.
Correlation does not equal Causation. Of course it doesn't. But removal of guns reduces the ease of the crime and the murder rate falls. The figures support it.

The figures do not support it. You have so many other variables between the populations of the UK and the USA to control for. The Scientific way to look at something as complex as this is to look at a test case where a single population went from No Guns to a lot of Guns or from a lot of Guns to no Guns. This transition has to happen in a very small period of time so the population does not change from before to after. Otherwise variables like culture, immigration, religion or﻿ lack of, etc...

Those variables you do not control for can be the difference or make﻿ up most of the difference in the two populations.

That talks about UK 'gun crime'. Imitations are classed as gun crime, and it's no surprise crimes like that went up after the ban. People can use imitations and don't have to be scared of a member of the public shooting back at them. Nobody is actually in any serious﻿ danger though.

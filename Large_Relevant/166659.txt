Military judge to hear arguments in Fort Hood shooting caseBy Jim Forsyth | Reuters – Wed, Jan 30, 2013

SAN ANTONIO (Reuters) - A military judge will begin hearing arguments on Wednesday on whether to remove the possibility of the death penalty against Major Nidal Hasan when he is put on trial for the 2009 killing of 13 people on the Fort Hood, Texas, Army base.
              More than three years after the Army psychiatrist allegedly opened fire in the worst shooting ever at a U.S. military base, a three-day hearing is scheduled at Fort Hood to try to put the long-delayed case back on track toward a court martial.
              Defense lawyers last week asked the court to set aside the possibility of the death penalty against Hasan, who is accused of firing more than 200 rounds from his semi-automatic pistol before he was shot and wounded.
              Hasan, 42, was left paralyzed from the chest down. In addition to the 13 soldiers killed, 32 people were wounded.
              Proceedings were sidetracked for much of the last year over Hasan's request to keep his beard because he is a Muslim. A military judge held Hasan in contempt because a full beard is a violation of Army grooming regulations, and the judge threatened to have him forcibly shaved.
              A new judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, was appointed last month to handle the case and the beard debate appears to have been put aside.
              Experts in military law said the defense strategy appears to be to suggest the possibility of Hasan pleading guilty in return for the death penalty being removed from consideration.
              "If that is what the defense seeks, they surely know that the chances that the military judge will grant the motion are nil," said Gary Solis, a law professor at the Georgetown University School of Law and the author of "The Law of Armed Conflict."
              Military law does not allow pleading guilty in such cases of capital murder, said Richard Rosen, a law professor at Texas Tech University and a retired Army Colonel.
              Geoffrey Corn, a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel and military law expert at the South Texas college of Law, said it is heartening that the trial judge appears to be committed to getting the proceedings going again.
              Several of those wounded in the shooting have complained about the slow pace of military justice.
              "I am hoping that she moves this case forward and sets it for trial, possibly this spring," Corn said.

Bring me this cold blooded killer, I would have no qualms avenging the deaths of my fellow countrymen. 3 years? Gimme a break, so much for the "speedy trial" thing.

first, he should have never gotten as far as he did in the military-his commanding officers should have seen to that. Secondly, if the requirement is an Army rule on the beard, how come he shaved it all those years he was in before being this? Now, it's against his Muslim belief? And then, this man KILLED 13 people and WOUNDED 32 others-why should he not DIE for that? Why would they take the death penalty off-just because he is a muslim & we might offend someone? You don't think the muslim people would hesitate to put one of our people to death if our military did that? We should not coddle this man-he doesn't deserve it just as those people didn't ask to die or be injured.

There are only about 100 eyewitness's and victims, what else do they need. The Army is not looking too good on this issue.

The man should be hung by his neck as soon as he is found guilty. He has lived long enough. I am only sorry that he can't be killed more then once. Oh yeah shave his beard first and after his execution bury him inside of a pig skin so he can't go to Allah clean!  Enough said!

Bet this is an old photo.  What is Reuters trying to do here, garner sympathy for the killer?

If they allow this #$%$ to escape the death penalty then the American justice systems create an environment for all criminals including murderers, rapist and other atrocities to freely continue while victims and family/friends of victims suffer.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Environmental groups say President Barack Obama's warning about climate change will soon be tested as he decides whether to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast.
Obama pledged in his inaugural speech Monday to respond to what he called the threat of climate change, saying: "Failure to do so would betray our children and future generations."
By singling out climate change, Obama indicated a willingness to take on an issue that he acknowledges was often overlooked during his first term. He also was setting up a likely confrontation with congressional Republicans who have opposed legislative efforts to curb global warming.
Environmental groups said the president's first test on climate change could come early this year as he decides whether to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline that will carry tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada, to Texas. The State Department has federal jurisdiction because the $7 billion pipeline begins in Canada.
Obama blocked the pipeline last year, citing uncertainty over the project's route through environmentally sensitive land in Nebraska. But on Tuesday, the state's Republican governor, Dave Heineman, gave his approval to a revised route for the pipeline, a widely anticipated move that nonetheless added to the political pressure for the Obama administration to approve or reject the new route without delay.
Republicans and many business groups say the project would help achieve energy independence for North America and create thousands of jobs.
But environmental groups say the pipeline would transport "dirty oil" and produce heat-trapping gases that contribute to global warming. They also worry about a possible spill.
"Starting with rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline, the president must make fighting global warming a central priority," said Margie Alt, executive director of Environment America.
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called Obama's comments on climate change "exactly right."
Andrew Hoffman, director of the Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan, said Obama's focus on climate showed political backbone.
"He finally had the courage to acknowledge the words 'climate change,'" Hoffman said, adding that Obama and other administration officials have frequently used words such as green jobs or clean energy to describe energy policy, instead of the more politically charged term.
"I find it very interesting that in this second term he's just coming right out and saying that climate change is exactly what we're dealing with," Hoffman said.
But on Tuesday, the first full day of Obama's second term, the White House disputed the notion that the president had waited until his second term to tackle climate issues, pointing to first-term accomplishments such as improved fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks.
White House spokesman Jay Carney called climate change "an important issue" and a priority for the president. "But it is not a singular priority. It is one of a host of priorities he believes we can act on," Carney said.
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the department would study a three-page letter from Heineman and Nebraska's environmental report as it completes its own review of the pipeline. A decision is not expected until April at the earliest.
Obama, in his address, said some people "may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science" that global warming exists and has human causes, "but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms."
The president has pledged to boost renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, along with more traditional energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas.
"The path toward sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition. We must lead it," Obama said.
He said developing new energy technologies will lead to jobs and new industries. "That is how we will preserve our planet," he said.
Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said Obama's "clarion call to action" on climate change "leaves no doubt this will be a priority in his second term."
After Hurricane Sandy and other extreme weather events, there has been more political momentum than ever to address climate change, Meyer said.
"With presidential leadership, that shift will continue and deepen over the next four years, and meaningful progress on climate change will become an important part of Barack Obama's legacy as president," he said.
Alt and other environmental leaders said they are counting on Obama to set tough limits on carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants and to continue federal investments in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.
Obama tried and failed in his first term to get a climate change bill through Congress. Some Democratic lawmakers and environmentalists have pushed for a tax on carbon pollution, but White House officials say they have no plan to propose one.
Scott Segal, an energy lobbyist who represents utilities and natural gas drillers, said Obama "missed the opportunity to remind listeners that climate change is an international phenomenon" that will require international solutions.
By imposing "inflexible" national policies to curb climate change, Obama could restrain the U.S. economy without delivering promised solutions, Segal said.

China did not sign the Kyoto protocol. The US signed but the Government did not ratify. So both are exempt from the requirements.

Meanwhile the smog in China's cities is so thick that they all wear masks 24/7. We give them a pass on destroying the planet because they lend us money. Save the planet by bringing manufacturing back to the US.

How about we just harness all that hot air coming from Washington?  We probably could eliminate the need to import any oil at all.

Anyone wonder why they changed it from "global warming" to "climate change?"  you think it was just for the reason that they figured out that the warming has slowed down for a while?  Or is it that they just want it to be our fault no matter what the climate decides to do?

Does this mean that China and India are implementing these plans in their nations? The US is small potatos compared to the pollution these countries are putting into the air.

Being Green

Checking out at the store, the young cashier suggested to the older woman, that she should bring her own grocery bags because plastic bags weren't ...good for the environment.
The woman apologized and explained, "We didn't have this green thing back in my earlier days."
The young clerk responded, "That's our problem today. Your generation did not care enough to save our environment for future generations."
She was right -- our generation didn't have the green thing in its day.
Back then, we returned milk bottles, soda bottles and beer bottles to the store. The store sent them back to the plant to be washed and sterilized and refilled, so it could use the same bottles over and over. So they really were truly recycled.
But we didn't have the green thing back in our day.
Grocery stores bagged our groceries in brown paper bags, that we reused for numerous things, most memorable besides household garbage bags, was the use of brown paper bags as book covers for our schoolbooks. This was to ensure that public property, (the books provided for our use by the school) was not defaced by our scribblings. Then we were able to personalize our books on the brown paper bags.
But too bad we didn't do the green thing back then.
We walked up stairs, because we didn't have an escalator in every store and office building. We walked to the grocery store and didn't climb into a 300-horsepower machine every time we had to go two blocks.
But she was right. We didn't have the green thing in our day.
Back then, we washed the baby's diapers because we didn't have the throwaway kind. We dried clothes on a line, not in an energy-gobbling machine burning up 220 volts -- wind and solar power really did dry our clothes back in our early days. Kids got hand-me-down clothes from their brothers or sisters, not always brand-new clothing.
But that young lady is right; we didn't have the green thing back in our day.
Back then, we had one TV, or radio, in the house -- not a TV in every room. And the TV had a small screen the size of a handkerchief (remember them?), not a screen the size of the state of Montana. In the kitchen, we blended and stirred by hand because we didn't have electric machines to do everything for us. When we packaged a fragile item to send in the mail, we used wadded up old newspapers to cushion it, not Styrofoam or plastic bubble wrap. Back then, we didn't fire up an engine and burn gasoline just to cut the lawn. We used a push mower that ran on human power. We exercised by working so we didn't need to go to a health club to run on treadmills that operate on electricity.
But she's right; we didn't have the green thing back then.
We drank from a fountain when we were thirsty instead of using a cup or a plastic bottle every time we had a drink of water. We refilled writing pens with ink instead of buying a new pen, and we replaced the razor blades in a razor instead of throwing away the whole razor just because the blade got dull.
But we didn't have the green thing back then.
Back then, people took the streetcar or a bus and kids rode their bikes to school or walked instead of turning their moms into a 24-hour taxi service. We had one electrical outlet in a room, not an entire bank of sockets to power a dozen appliances. And we didn't need a computerized gadget to receive a signal beamed from satellites 23,000 miles out in space in order to find the nearest burger joint.
But isn't it sad the current generation laments how wasteful we old folks were just because we didn't have the green thing back then?
Please forward this on to another selfish old person who needs a lesson in conservation from a smart #$%$ young person.

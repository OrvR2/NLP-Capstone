Piers Morgan Deportation Petition Reaches 68,000 Signatures, White House Must Respond
by Anjali Sareen | 4:57 pm, December 24th, 2012

» 561 comments




 
















  

The petition to deport CNN host Piers Morgan for his recent comments on gun control has reached over 68,000 signatures as of this posting, which will force the White House to respond. The petition, created Friday, needed 25,000 signatures within 30 days for the White House to take action and it’s reached far more than that in a mere three days. 
In case you missed it, the petition called for Morgan to be deported for his “hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution.” Gun advocates are angry about Morgan’s comments calling for increased gun legislation in America and are accusing him of wanting to “undermine the Bill of Rights.”

Morgan has aggressively responded to the petition several times on Twitter, most recently Tweeting a video link to a town hall on guns that he hosted last week, with the message, “This is why I’m facing deportation from America” and the hashtag, #GunControlNow.

Bloviating blob of Brit flotsam Piers Morgan probably owns stock in gun manufacturing companies. He helps weapons sales to skyrocket while drawing attention to moribund CNN.

I suppose that website will be taken down sooner or later because baggernuts will keep flooding it with every imaginable frivolous petition, spoiling it for real issues that should be taken seriously.
Typical.

I dare say this once great and noble gets sillier and sillier by the day. Now, we want to deport a British citizen because he’s critical of public policy issue, aka lack of gun control? Sad, truly sad… An exceptional nation that can’t take any criticism from a non-national? Really sad…

While just 450,000 people to the left of Fidel Castro watch Piers Morgan, 330,000,000 do not  watch him so obviously American wants him to get his british butt out of Amerca..

On a side point: Piers Morgan is the Nephew of Neville (piece in our time, Hitler is an honorable man that can be negotiated with) Chamberlain.

Uh, no, he is a FOREIGN CITIZEN attacking our US Constitution.  THAT sir is a violation of AMERICAN LAW.

I’d have to say let’s make this fair….strip that scumbag Murdoch of his ill-gained citizenship and deport his sorry ass as well. 
Murdoch has quite obviously overseen some pretty sleazy phone hacking and much more….deport him back home to Australia on a slow boat….and NEVER allow him back and never allow him to own ANY media in this country.
Though I agree with much of what Morgan said regarding the baggernut gun nut culture here in the USA, if he is guilty of phone hacking like Murdoch send the chump home!…….but ONLY….I repeat…ONLY!!!….if Murdoch faces the same fate. 
Fairness and equality under the law!

Take away the guns of everyone who signed that petition, quarter soldiers in their homes, search and seize their property frequently, and so on through the rest of the Bill of Rights. Or, convince them that the First Amendment protects even Mr. Morgan’s right to say what he thinks.

Attacking your US constitution ? Thats a good one. Your President removed the fifth amendment of the constitution with the elimination of due process with indefinite detention.Where were you then? That is attacking the constitution. Mr. Morgan is a talk show host who has suggested there should be some control on how many guns should be made available in a country where more than 11000 people are murdered by guns annually. There is a distinction there somewhere but what should be expect from a Country that has declared a war on a plant and protitution is illegal unless it is filmed and distributed on the internet.  Imbeciles…

Sorry idiot.  It is against the law for foreigners to impugn, attack, trash, or encourage others to attack our US Constitution or Bill of Right.  What don’t you get about the fact what Piers Morgan is doing IS ILLEGAL?

From the extreme — one might accurately say lunatic fringe — left wing newspaper, The Guardian: 
Lord Justice Leveson has described former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan’s assertion that he had no knowledge of alleged phone hacking as “utterly unpersuasive”, and said the practice may well have occurred at the title in the late 1990s.
Morgan was asked during his evidence to the Leveson inquiry about an interview he gave Press Gazette in 2007 when he said that phone hacking was an “investigative practice that everyone knows was going on at almost every paper in Fleet Street for years”.
In his testimony, Morgan, who now hosts a chatshow on CNN in New York, downplayed the comment as “passing on rumours that I’d heard” and said that there was no phone hacking at the Daily Mirror under his editorship from 1995 to 2004.
“Overall, Mr Morgan’s attempt to push back from his own bullish statement to the Press Gazette was utterly unpersuasive,” said Leveson in his report on the culture, practices and ethics of the press, published on Thursday. “This was not, in any sense at all, a convincing answer.”

Sidwell Friends School is a Quaker academy, which explains why there is no gun-toting security aside from the President’s detail. Quakers abhor violence, sometimes to their own detriment. Meanwhile, it is quite true that over 30% of high schools nationwide have armed security.

Rejoined the NRA?  I already belong but within the last week I’ve joined a rifle club, the Gun Owners of America, Grass Roots North Carolina and also ordered a M1 Garand from the Civilian Marksmanship Program.  Not because of Newtown but because of the knee jerk reaction to Newtown.
I have written my congressman and both of my senators expressing my disapproval of taking ineffective measures… prohibition being the biggest one of them.
I have expressed support for both police officers and controlled entry and exit points at schools (a la courhouse) and also to allow those adults who have concealed carry permits (roughly 2% of the population) to carry in any and every public space.  (It’s not like bad guys don’t already.)  In my state CCW holders who are actually armed are required to identify themselves as being armed on their first contact with police officers so there is no mistake about their legal status.
I am completely convinced the focus on the tool used is going to lead to disaster.  A person up to no good will merely find another way and there are plenty of them for a motivated killer to use; even a motivated mass killer.

DearMr. Morgan: Secretly, I think you would love to be deported from our blood soaked shores. Your career would skyrocket! I see Nobel Peace Prize. I know you are trying to help us but a small minority of positively bat-shit cwazy people insist upon being afraid and angry all the time. They like the feeling of being cornered rats because nobody ever took the time to love them. That and having teeny tiny dicks makes them cwazy.

I’m sick of seeing Piers Morgan on every time I make the mistake of turning on the TV at the wrong time of night, but why on earth would anyone attempt to deport people who speak their minds?  The first amendment and the second amendment can exist peacefully, and if they truly were forced to come into conflict, the first amendment comes first, as always.

How is deporting Morgan “eviscerating the first amendment”? Explain the logic there. He’s not a US citizen that I know of, and it’s not like his rabid leftism will go unspoken in his absence… I mean, really; if we thought shutting Morgan up would shut the Left up, we’d have done it a long time ago.
The real question is why such a bozo – or any leftist – even wants to be here. You guys seemingly hate this country, and everything it was founded upon and stands for – why stay? If I believed half the crap all of you peddle, I’d have left a long time ago…
…except there’s no where someone who stands for individual liberty can go, is there? There’s plenty of little socialist juntas for all of you idiots to go to, but for us?
Besides…. we wouldn’t have to “eviscerate the first amendment” if you clowns would stop trying to “eviscerate the second”. So how about you stop, stfu, and leave the rest of us alone?

I can find easily 5-10 million Americans willing to have me exiled, although illegal under international law.  Morgan has nothing to worry about.  I hope it raises his ratings.

Lazy left hasn’t even READ the complaint against Morgan:
.
“British Citizen and CNN television host Piers Morgan is engaged in a hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment. We demand that Mr. Morgan be deported immediately for his effort to undermine the Bill of Rights and for exploiting his position as a national network television host to stage attacks against the rights of American citizens.”

.
President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder are pushing a law to allow immigrants to purchase firearms more easily.
The Department of Justice’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) requires legal aliens to live in a state for 90 days before buying a gun. The ATF does this through a rule attached to the Gun Control Act of 1968.
Recently Obama requested Holder’s DOJ proposed to eliminate that 90-day residency requirement rule.
.
.
Go figure.  Now why would Obama want people in this country as immigrants (legal or illegal) to be able to quickly buy firearms?  Why?






wiwade52



Obama sends his kids to a school where armed guards are used as a matter of fact.
.
The school, Sidwell Friends School in Washington, DC, has 11 security officers and is seeking to hire a new police officer as we speak.
.
If you dismiss this by saying, “Of course they have armed guards — they get Secret Service protection,” then you’ve missed the larger point.
.
The larger point is that this is standard operating procedure for the school, period. And this is the reason people like NBC’s David Gregory send their kids to Sidwell, they know their kids will be protected from the carnage that befell kids at a school where armed guards weren’t used (and weren’t even allowed).
.
Shame on President Obama for seeking more gun control and for trying to prevent the parents of other school children from doing what he has clearly done for his own. His children an uncounted thousands of the wealthy’s kids sit under the protection guns afford, while the children of regular Americans are sacrificed.

wiwade52



So in your “strict gun control” world no doubt David Gregory’s kids would go to a school still protected by armed guards.  Michael Moore’s body guards would still be allowed to carry guns to protect him.  Warren Buffet would be allowed to carry a personal firearm wherever he goes for protection because he is ‘better than you or I’.  And of course, every Hollywood actor would be entitled to any number of firearms since they are so important to society and face so many threats.  And for sure Diane Feinstein and Harry Reed would be permitted any firearm they wanted, since we know by their own admission, they pack.

This gun control issue is an issue that is used to manipulate people on both sides. The right use it as some ruse to try and convince people to part with their money because the big bad liberals are coming to take your guns, so you can’t defend yourselves against the tyrannical government. Seriously, what is a gun going to do against a government with nukes?
The left use it to get their base all wrapped up in protecting people from crazies with guns. Let me ask the left a question? What has Obama and the Dems done about gun control in the last 6 years? Dems control of Congress started in 2006, where was the gun control legislation? Obama has been Pres. for 4 years and he got an F rating from the Brady Campaign Against Gun Violence. Just understand lefties, that only until 20 children are slaughtered did your side do anything about this. Oh and you still haven’t done anything yet, so it remains to be seen what will actually be done, just don’t forget to sign your checks to your gun control organization of choice.
As Johnny Rotten so eloquently put it, “ever get the feeling you’re being cheated”?

Do you think that anyone who professes to endorse (quote, end quote) gun control really, really, really believes there is anything they can do, without abriding the U.S. Constitution and the recent Supreme Court decision, to keep guns out of the hands of the Adam Lanzas of the world.
* How about a assault rifle ban. Tried for 10 years (1994-2004) and the U.S. Justice Department, in a full study, concluded that the ban did nothing to (a) decrease the number of gun murders or (b) decrease the number of multiple murders — like the event at Newtown, Conn. Wny? Handguns are used in 99% of all gun murders. Duh. Adam Lanza himself had two semi-automatic handguns along with his assault rifle. If assault rifles were illegal, he would have done his worst with the Glock 19.
* OK, how about anyone who wants to register a weapon has to undergo a government approved psychiatric evaluation. Gee, that sounds good, right? Except that Adam Lanza never sought to own a gun. He took his mother’s, and she was, by all accounts, a perfect citizen. Also, are you ready to sit in a room while some government shrink asks you, “Did you love your mother?”
* Gee, maybe we could demand that every one who owns an illegal weapon register it immediately. I know there are thousands of Los Angeles gang members and countless Chicago thugs just waiting to come into City Hall and register their weapons.
Well, I’m out of ideas. Anyone else have a thought? Or do you just have sound bytes. You know, like, “I’m for gun control” or “We have to do something about mental health and guns.” The No. 1 problem with people who identify themselves as gun control advocates, including the goofy Dianne Feinstein, have no idea what the hell would stop the carnage. All they want to do is blither “gun control, gun control, gun control,” as if that will solve the problem.

I just stumbled on this issue.  I believe the petition has merit. 
 As a foreign national residing in the country, Morgan has Constitutional rights, BUT, that applies to prior restraint, meaning the Government can’t prevent his speech, but the Government and the American citizens can render him ‘personaa non grata,’ based on his behavior while in our country.  Political criticism is quite different than promoting sedition.  Yes, politics and the Constitution are very different entities.  Questioning the legitimacy of the latter is not recommended in any Sovereignty.
Under any circumstances, no American should approve of a non-American meddling in our affairs.  Unless of course, that meddling coupled with one’s politics offer an American citizen, or plurality enough of an advantage to sacrifice principle for political gain?
I wonder what ALLEN BLACK will say?

Of course we Americans have a right to debate important issues about our lives as Americans. THESE DAMN BRITS AND AUSTRALIANS have got to STFU.

Get rid of foreign agent provocateurs in America.Australia is considering deporting all non-citizen individuals, if convicted, involved in riots during Islamic protests held in Sydney this weekend. Australian immigration minister Chris Bowen, after being urged by the opposition, stated that he will consider the option of deporting all those non-citizen protestors engaged in the violent protests. Since the protests, the opposition members have been urging the government to take immediate action against the protests and punish those guilty of taking part in it.
The protests, which were carried on in Sydney this weekend by so called Islamic Fundamentalists in Australia contained people carrying placards and shouting slogans against the makers of a video released on an internet website disrespectful to the prophet Muhammad.
Chris Bowen said that he has taken strong notice of the protests and will do whatever he can to get to the bottom of the affairs that caused trouble in Sydney. Bowen further said that he will be considering all possible actions against those non-citizens who took part in these protests.

Though I doubt it would be used, portions of the Alien Registration Act of 1940 (also known as the Smith Act, 76th United States Congress, 3d session, ch. 439, 54 Stat. 670, 18 U.S.C. § 2385) and The Internal Security Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 993 (also known as the Subversive Activities Control Act or the McCarran Act) are still in effect. This could be what he is referring to, though it would be an extreme stretch of what’s left of the laws. In an ironic twist, the U.S. military continues to use portions of the McCarran Act, citing it in U.S. Army regulation AR 190-11 in support of allowing installation commanders to suspend the Second Amendment.

The President of the United States does not have time to respond to this idiotic nonsense. There should be a petition to deport Republicans who hold the government hostage for their own political gain. 
“Patriotic” Republicans think that free speech applies to them, and anyone else is deemed a traitor for putting power to truth. Morgan probably has a duel citizenship, a little fact the initiator of the petition should have taken to the time to discover.
But that’s how “conservatives” think. They knee jerk react and then open their mouths to free the bile. I wager that the troll who signed the petition are all members of the NRA.

OK. As you say, those two laws could be considered, but I am sure it would take far more than a discussion of the Second Amendment’s validity today to invoke those acts against Piers Morgan. This is not “teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States by force or violence.” http://tucnak.fsv.cuni.cz/~calda/Documents/1940s/Alien%20Registration%20Act%20of%201940.html 
It is interesting to note that while the Alien Registration Act would seem to only apply to aliens, the actual wording says it applies to anyone in the United States, and the law was most famously used against American (born and raised) citizens who were members of the Communist Party.
As for the Internal security Act of 1950, almost all of it was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. What remains of the act is used to support the legality of conducting background checks when determining whether a person should be granted a security clearance for government/military access to highly classified information. Failing to get the clearance is not a punishable offense. I am sure that Piers Morgan will never apply for a security clearance, nor be asked to.

I have been to one or two such countries. I feel quite certain that you have not. I have seen modernization and fantastic economic growth in China. China’s economic growth has averaged 10% per year for TWENTY FIVE YEARS STRAITGHT!
Aren’t we number 17 on the list of educated people? What countries place above us on that list? I’m sure you would consider every one of the to be “socialist.” Foxcom, the Korean owned company that makes Apple products in China uses cheap labor, but the real “sell” for China was that Foxom found 8,000 Chinese engineers to work for them within one week, but in the US it would take a year to find that many available and qualified for the work.
I could go on and on about the relative happiness and prosperity of countries that you would call socialist, but I don’t think you can be convinced and long posts don’t get read.

I think engaging the public isn’t a stupid idea. A mechanism that lets the public know their voices are heard by it’s leaders, I think that is an honorable aim. But it’s being abused by those who should probably stick to comment sections like these if they just want to be cynical and snide. These petitions may be entertaining, but the executive branch of our government is not there to entertain us.

The first amendment applies to more than just US citizens, but rather every person within the borders of United States Territory. 
Second, why should we leave the United States when the constitution gives us the ability to pass laws to change society in our own image? After all, we just won the last election in a land slide, and our main opposition, the Republican Party, is has completely dropped in polling to 32% favorability to 52% unfavorability. If anything, why don’t you leave?
Third: The second amendment was, since it’s inception until a recent Supreme Court decision in 2008, considered a collective right to bear arms which was to be regulated, not an individual right. The language in the constitution is “A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” So for the right wing of the country to demand that we completely ignore that first sentence, and over 200 years of the previous interpretation, just because some fat sweaty man named Samuel Alito whom none on the left respect, let alone agree with, is a really weak argument to make.

Yup. I talk about China. I have seen the poverty there, but I have also seen the kind of wealth that our American entrepreneurs build up by only hiring people part time so they don’t have to pay a good wage and provide benefits like health insurance.
Suicide. Our Army has a high rate of suicide. When Foxcom has hundreds of thousands of workers, some of them will be suicidal just because they are human.
Baby girls never were tossed into wells (that would poison the well), but the practice of killing them has gone, as has the practice of crushing a girl’s feet so she would be attractive. The original practice started because of the extreme poverty that did exist and it meant the girl would probably die of starvation, anyway. It was not practiced by people who were able to survive while keeping the child. Most of all, that was the old China of more than 100 years ago.
I am not claiming that China is perfect by any means. I am saying that the China you think you know does not exist!
The number of children. I have met many young Chinese (I taught them English) and every one of them had at least one sister or brother. Here are the exceptions to that one child rule: 1. If the first child is a girl, the couple can keep trying until they do have a boy, and the girl is certainly not killed, starved, or otherwise deprived. She is as likely to go to college as her brother. 2. Exceptions were made for all minorities, since a one child rule could have wiped them out. Minorities do have government protection like that. 3. Any family that is willing to move to the less populated regions of western China can have as many children as they want. 4. It is also possible to pay a tax and the “middle class” can afford it.
The most important thing for you to learn is that China’s middle class is growing at a very rapid pace, while ours is shrinking just as quickly as China’s is growing.
This is because China is no longer communist in anything but name. It is a free-market socialist country that is lacking only one more key ingredient. That is democracy. The Chinese aren’t all that concerned about democracy but they are the most naturally free-market, cutthroat capitalists in the world!
  Corruption. What could be more capitalistic than corruption? What prevents corruption? Government regulations and controls. But you don’t want those, right?

I am betting your last name is Duranty and the scum Stalin loving Walter Duranty was your father:
Walter Duranty (1884 – October 3, 1957) was a controversial Liverpool-born, British-American journalist who served as the Moscow Bureau Chief of The New York Times (1922–36). 
For a series of stories on the Soviet Union, Duranty won a Pulitzer Prize (1932). 
Duranty has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine, torture, murder, corruption, and crimes against humanity in Stalinist Russia.
Years later, there were calls to revoke his Pulitzer; even The Times acknowledged his articles constituted “some of the worst reporting to appear in this newspaper.” [1]
In 1933, Stalin himself praised Duranty, saying that Duranty “(tried) to tell the truth about our country.






Devil’s Spawn



What I am really saying as the bottom line is that each country has its own history of problems and attempted solutions. China is only one example of this, but it is the one that would most surprise you, so I brought it up.
We also have a history of child labor, seven-day/12 hour work weeks, mistreating women (of any age), corruption, greed, and cruelty posing as a moral right and even obligation (think of how slavery was justified). We started correcting most of this before China did. China is correcting all of this now.
One of the very first Chinese I met was an old man who thanked America for showing China that the five day work week is the way to go. He said thank you to me as an American for that!
Five day work week, decent pay, and other capitalist benefits are coming to China, and China is now losing jobs to other Asian countries that are behind China in those areas.

I agree that the petition and the situation are silly and as I said, I doubt these or any laws would be used. However, this is an example of the fact that we have a government that constantly passes thousands of laws and rarely repeals anything.

Kudos for taking up the challenge of identifying the laws.
I found the background of them to be very instructive. The earliest one was a response to the very real threat of WW II. The second one was the response of a paranoid group of politicians. Thankfully, our court system is independent of those politicians, which is one thing that protects us. That third branch with the authority to void laws that are unconstitutional.

Hussein carried on this same policy, but eliminated the need for court petitions since Hussein kills them instead via drones and has approved drone usage over US airspace and was the first to mark and kill a US citizen.

Matt

“How is deporting Morgan “eviscerating the first amendment”?”
It’s state punishment against someone for his speech. Something that is rather heavily frowned on by Amendment #1.
“He’s not a US citizen that I know of”
And that’s relevant…how, exactly? Point out the portion of the constitution which indicates that its protections only apply to citizens.






Matt



Amnesty from….what, exactly?
Be very specific.

Demanding someone be punished for speaking is not expressing yourself, it’s calling for the government to violate someone’s constitutional rights. It’s anti-American.

We are indeed in a sorry state. Pandora’s box has been opened and we may not be able to close it. 
But, knowing that only bad people will refuse to cooperate with the desire to save lives does not mean we can’t try to do it. Look at the shooting of volunteer firemen. The killer stole the AR-15 he used. So, another evil crazy man got hold of that weapon, but he would not have gotten it if someone else had not bought it legally. Anyone who goes around telling folks he/she owns such a weapon makes him/herself a target. The Newtown shooter shot his own mother and the Webster, NY killer beat his grandmother to death, then years later stole an assault rifle from someone who was probably a “responsible gun owner.”

Oh I totally agree it was a frivolous petition and waste of resources (by the very people who tend to complain of government waste, no less), but there *are* good suggestions some people might make. I’ve seen this happen before at a company I worked at and will be eternally pissed both at the idiots who abused the online suggestion system we were provided with AND the CEO who so quickly lost faith in ALL staff and shut the *whole thing* down rather than simply having a responsible person moderate. There were plenty of us who would have gladly done it in our free time. (Sometimes I wonder if the immature nonsense became a convenient excuse for not addressing some of the more sober concerns posted.)
Perhaps to tamp down on this type of stuff they should greatly increase the number of signatures required (and raise the time period to get them nominally). Like 500k signatures in six months or something.

So to all these people that revere the constitution in high regard, please read the rest of it past the 2nd amendment.

You are right.  But it isn’t just Boehner, it is all the republican house and senate members who put Grover Norquist upon a pedestal and adhere to their pledge with him INSTEAD of doing what is best for their constituents – obviously a violation of their Oath and the US Constitution.
The problem is that the GOP has roped themselves into these gerrymandered districts where the diehard religious right and tea party terrorists live – who don’t care if their taxes go up.  They don’t know what a democracy is and evidently don’t care.  They don’t support any candidate who even says “hello” to a democrat and that especially makes working with idiots like this extremely difficult when a democracy is consensus – not a “my way or the highway” attitude like they have.  These are people who are still mad that the confederacy lost the war and the slaves were freed.  They need to get over it.

Those rich people you depise can’t write laws. But like all rich people everywhere they want to get richer, and the only way to make money is to spend money thru investments. That means jobs. Quit getting your talking points from Media matters and Occupy wall street. Just like all socialists you can’t think beyond your next meal. And it’s your precious unions that are driving jobs overseas by pricing themselves out of the market. It’s “Right to Work” states that are the fastest growing and have the lowest unemployment rates. All this is probably beyond your comprehension level. Your progressive education made sure you couldn’t think for yourself.

Where HAVE you been living?  Those rich people pick who are going to be our senators, governors, etc.  They pick who runs and they pay them.  We don’t really get to choose who our leaders are.  Surely you weren’t under the illusion that we really elect our leaders, not after all the articles in the media informing us otherwise.  
My ‘progressive education’ did not do anything to my thinking.  Sci-fi is what formed my thinking.  It broadens your thinking and gives you new ideas, new ways of looking at things.  I started reading it at the age of 9 and that was 60 years ago.  I’ve seen a lot, traveled a lot, lived everywhere, including Taiwan.  My father-in-law was a senator and multi-millionaire there; so your ill formed ideas of me are just so much trash.  I speak 3 languages, a little of a 4th and I am an obsessive reader and researcher of everything and I can tell you that you are completely wrong about your economic theories.  The best economic theory is Keynes.  It is the only one that works and in order for it or any other one to work a country has to have a certain percentage of its economy in manufacturing.  You do not get a healthy economy either by sending the jobs to another country.  The rich did not do that because of the unions.  They did it because they were greedy.  The rich are always greedy.  I know this.  The rich always try to cheat anyway that they can.  That’s always been their way throughout history.  They always try to squeeze whatever they can out of the workers.  Read about the labor movement starting back, oh, say, the 1700s.  It’s always the same.
These right to work states you’re talking about are also going to have the lowest PAY.  You read one thing right though–I am a Socialist.  I don’t have to worry about my next meal though.  I drive Mercedes.  My kids like to tease me about that but I don’t see anything incongruous about it–a good car is a good car.
Oh, I don’t have to get my talking points from the media though.  I worked out the Keynes Economic Theory decades ago.  I was quite surprised when I came across it in my reading and found it had a name.  It’s good to be smart.  The unions never drove jobs out of this country.  Greed did.  You see, I know how the rich think.  Been there, done that.

Yes, do you want to know why?  I bought 3 new buick wagons in a row.  First day I had those pieces of junk they wouldn’t start.  It was the carburetor but they didn’t want to admit to THAT because that costs money and hours of free labor to fix.  One car had brake problems of a type that couldn’t be fixed and couldn’t stop a car either.  Also on an incline the stupid car wouldn’t go over 30 mph.  Try driving that in North Carolina and thereabouts on vacation.  All the cars are backed up behind you wondering what the heck you’re doing.  Fun!  Another broke down irreparably within a year.  They all were lemons.  Until American manufacturers can make good cars I will continue to buy foreign cars.  My first Mercedes was a wagon and kept going for 9 years until an 83 year old woman suddenly turned left in front of me.  Totaled it!  My second one is one of my daughter’s.  It’s a 1998 420 sports sedan, lousy on any wet surface but man does that car have take off!  And it doesn’t give me any problems like those stupid buicks!  Besides, I bought my mom, brother and son foreign cars that were MADE in America!






BBrianL



I knew you were a socialist just from your comments. Socialism is for the people, not the socialist. If you believed all your crap you’d give away your Mercedes and all your other worldly goods for the good of society. Of course you won’t ’cause you’re a hypocrite.
Right to work states have lower pay because they have lower cost of living.
If Keynes was right, why do we still have a stalled economy and high unemployment even after a trillion and a half stimulus? Government can’t create wealth. It can only give to those what it has taken from others less its own cut.
You’re right about greed driving jobs out of the country. The greed of the unions pricing themselves out of the market. Why do you think all the foreign car makers are building factories here in “Right to Work” states while GM is outsourcing jobs to China.
I too read scifi since I was about 10 years old, but I didn’t swallow the utopianism present in so many stories. I also saw the absolute worst run places around the world during 20 years in the military. I am skilled labor in a highly unionized industry, yet I work in a non-union shop that is hiring while the union shops are going under, and I make a good living without having to pay some union for nothing. Self determination is a concept you apparently have no experience with.
It sounds like you’ve never had to work for anything in your life. One of the idle rich that has glommed onto the lib/prog agenda as some sort of way to assuage your feelings of guilt cause you’ve never produced anything of value. Your worthless existence makes you want to dictate to others your idea of how to live as long as it doesn’t impact your privileged life.

No, no, my idea of Socialism is European Socialism where they tax the rich  just enough that no one in the country needs to suffer, that everyone has enough.  Why would you have a problem with this?  Excessive riches create problems for the people who possess them.  They consider themselves above the law for one.  They break laws both large and small and it messes up their personalities big time!!!  I’ve seen that last one up close and in action!
On the contrary I did work for 5 years and then when my husband retired we moved to where my daughter lives so that we could take care of her children who were 3 and 6.  Her and her husband’s careers kept them very busy and they needed a babysitter who was available 24/7.
I grew up in a middle class life style in southern Illinois.  Some years we were even a little poor.  When I married my husband his family was rich but papa goofed and lost most of the money so most of his kids had to come to the States to earn a living which my husband did as a high school physics teacher and janitor.  Fortunately, our daughter earns a lot of money in her profession and also we have an excellent retirement income.  Between us and our daughter we are able to help many members of our family during these perilous economic times–much as a true Socialist government would do.  
I saw Taiwan in 1968-70.  I saw people begging in the streets.  I saw my family’s reaction to it or rather non-reaction.  I saw how rich people run their businesses, how loans are taken out with no intention of ever paying them back.  No, I don’t like runaway Capitalism.  Small business Capitalism, yes.  What we have now, no.
If all you read was utopian sci-fi, then you didn’t read much.  How long has it been since you read any?
Why would I give away a 1998 Mercedes?  First, it wouldn’t even net much if anyone sold it.  Second, it’s not mine, it’s my daughter’s.  Third, what would I drive?  Are you saying I don’t deserve a car to drive?  What a nasty, elitist thing to say!  Illogical also.  It makes no sense for me to give away the only car I have to drive.  And what good would giving away all my worldly goods do?  There’s not that much to them.  Then what would I do?  Starve in the street?  You really are an illogical person!  No wonder you’re not a Socialist.  It does tend to be logical people who become Socialists.  Probably Spock was a Socialist.  It would be logical.

You apparently do not know anything about the red neck states and those that reside in them. Have you ever heard of racism? You calling them names and using profanity to describe them does nothing to boost anyone’s faith in your intellect in this debate. Let me see, according to you red necks live in the woods, carry guns, shoot and hunt – does this not remind you of another group of Americans? The colonials lived that way. You shall get nowhere in any debate when you take it off the subject and start attacking someone personally. You have the right to free speech and therefore have the right to do so, but that means the very fabric of the debate has fallen apart and is now a shouting match. Liberal used to mean tolerant of others and their beliefs, I guess somewhere along the way that changed to being intolerant, critical and unwilling to even entertain anyone elses viewpoints but your own. Please tell me, where is the liberal in that?






BBrianL



You need to get rid of your Mercedes because it’s a symbol of wealth. Drive a Lada, or maybe an old Yugo. Maybe you could even find an old East German Trabant. Demonstrate you are really “down with the people”.
European socialism is so great that the governments have no money. Their producers are fleeing the confiscatory tax rates. Their people are so used to their entitlements that they refuse to work overtime or past the age of 50. Talk about the idle rich. There they have the idle poor that lives off the government.
I saw socialist dictatorships around the world that keep the poor poor in order to keep them dependent on their government overlords.
You want order. You want people to be the same. You have been assimilated, to use a Star Trek euphemism. You are the Borg.
Freedom and self determination creates wealth. Control only creates apathy and death. You are afraid of freedom and self determination, thus your desire to control the lives of others. You wouldn’t survive without an outside controller. You have drunk deep from the Kool aid and you are lost. You think I wish you to starve in the streets? No I expect you to take care of yourself, and to not live off the largesse of anyone. You are the illogical one.

I want people to be the same?  Well, let’s see….first off, my family ranges from practically illiterate hillbillies to MDs and Ph.D.s and then there’s the whites, Europeans, Chinese, Mexicans, Africans-Americans, Japanese, Filipinos, Jews and Native Americans in my family…..yeah, I want everyone to be the same all right…..but don’t you think that with my family that fight was lost a long time ago?  Also, anyone who speaks 3 or 4 languages isn’t exactly looking for sameness.  And, for heaven’s sake, my husband of 49 years IS Chinese!  The only thing Borg about me is the assimilation of diverse peoples into one family and if you really think you can do that and have them all come out the same…..well, you live in a different universe than I do!  I can’t even get my HUSBAND to agree on anything but politics with me and even that not all the time!  I even broke our garage door twice backing the car out too fast because I was mad at him–so forget that one!
You DO like to speak in sweeping platitudes, don’t you?  That’s all your words are–sweeping platitudes!  And me with an outside controller?  Tell that one to my family!  Tell it to my husband!  You can’t make sweeping statements about the life of someone about whom you know nothing.  You don’t like what I say so you start making sweeping statements about my life.  That is beyond illogical!  That is senseless!
What we are slowly getting in this country is another type of dictatorship–one of the rich.  Only people like you are too blind to see it!  So be it!  I’ve tried to warn you!
Oh yes, if the Borg is all you know of sci-fi, it’s just like I said, you’re not a REAL sci-fi fan!  I’ve been reading for 60 years, since I was 9.  There are hundreds of authors that I would imagine you have never heard of.  How about Olivia Butler?  Quick!  Look her up!  Tell me what Dawn is about.

Just like all leftist drones you try to paint anyone you disagree with as a racist. Too bad it won’t work with me. My description that you want everyone to be the same is in thought.
You are a slave. What’s sad is you are a slave that put the chains on yourself. You don’t even realize you’ve given up your freedom. Free will and self determination is an alien concept you are no longer able to understand. Nothing can get thru the propaganda you’ve swallowed along with the Kool aid. You are lost, and to be perfectly honest? Good riddance to bad rubbish. You aren’t a scifi fan. You live in fantasy.






Anonymous



A slave?  What on earth to?  I’m retired, I get up when I want, usually around noon, do what I want, eat whatever I want.  You tell me what more could I want?  Wait!  I could want better knees!  My daughter tells me that I’m not a good candidate for knee surgery though.  Tell me though what freedom I don’t have.  I buy whatever books I want, pursue whatever hobbies I want.  If someone in my family needs something, I buy it for them.  In case you’re thinking I’m rich you’re quite mistaken.  Look up what a 1998 Mercedes is worth–$6000.  Go buy yourself one.  I merely have a good retirement because my husband worked two jobs.  He’s a very healthy ol’ guy.  He’s 80 and the oldest and healthiest of 7 kids, 2 of whom have already died.  Actually he’s healthier than me.  
You don’t really like to look at people as they really are.  You just like to go off on ‘lefties’.  If you ever met me in person and didn’t know who I was, you’d like me, everyone does, lefties and righties.  
And I’m not only a sci-fi fan, I also write it.






BBrianL



Yes. You are a slave. A slave to your ideology. You can’t see it is capitalism that has given you all that you have. That it was capitalism that allowed for all the opportunities you and your family had. 
That it was socialism that killed over 100 million people in the 20th century goes right over your head. Even if you accept it in a historical perspective you don’t accept it as the oppressive, individual liberty destroying system it really is. How it destroys motivation and freedom of thought.
Again, yes, you are a slave to your ideology that blinds you to the absolute good fortune you had to live in a country that guarantees freedom of thought and expression; that gives you the ability to defend those freedoms from the depredations of a tyrannical government; that allowed you to pursue  your own path to happiness and success. All socialism does is throw blockades in the way of individuals “for the greater good”.
I know the gifts this country has given me. For this reason I put my life on the line in its defense for 20yrs in the military. I take my oath of allegiance to the Constitution as sacred, and I will defend this system that has given more people freedom throughout the world than any other, against all its enemies foreign and domestic.
Socialism/communism/progressive, they are all the same. They rob people of their humanity; of their desires; of their passions. they are a blight on the human spirit. In my 55yrs on this planet I’ve seen the depredations of the system you hold dear and if I could rid the world of your ilk I would, but to do that would destroy the very thing I believe in. Free will and self determination. 
You can go to h*ll on your own, but I will do my utmost to protect the innocent from the evil of your ideology. Your ideology is a cancer and can never be destroyed, only controlled.






Anonymous



No, the only true blight on this country is people like you who would say such horrible things about others, people who you don’t even know, people who you would consign to hell and death just because of a few sentences in a blog.  This is truly the sign of an evil person.  End of discussion.






BBrianL



Oh I know you all right. I know you from the assumptions about me that you spew without even knowing what or who I am. From the accusations you throw at me without cause. You really need to look in the mirror when you throw your unfounded accusations of racism or worse. The evil you accuse me of are those things practiced by socialists all over the world and throughout history.
My description of you finally hit home. And maybe there’s some small spark of humanity left in your atheist’s heart. Because for you to be a self described socialist you have given up all your faith in anything but government. Your hypocrisy is exposed by your unwillingness to give up your capitalist goods, gained in a capitalist society, that allows one to reach any level they are willing to work and fight for. A real socialist would give up all those things not already given to all others, and would keep only those things given to them by their benevolent masters in the government.
You picked this fight, not I. And it’s you leaving the field in defeat just as always happens when totalitarianism is confronted by free men. Socialists have nothing to live for, for they are nothing as individuals and have no identity outside of the group. I pity you and those that think like you. But make no mistake, when it comes to defending our constitutional republic and those unalienable rights enshrined in our founding documents, you will find no one more steadfast in the defense of liberty than I!

I said that you jumped to conclusions, didn’t I?  Where on earth did you get the idea that I was an atheist?  I am not and never have been.  I have less reason than most to be an atheist.  I have had certain experiences since I was a child that I believe to have been the direct hand of God or its guardian spirits or angels.  You can’t get less atheist than that.  Indeed, I believe that God wanted me to be a minister but since I have a family that just wasn’t possible but I am extremely religious and pray every night never missing once even when I have an operation–so dude, you are really off!!!  Believing in Socialism is what Jesus would want us to believe in.  If you read the bible carefully you will see this.  
As for picking a fight, I wasn’t even talking to you, I was talking to some other guy and then you came along and you can keep going as far as I’m concerned.  You’re a very nasty sounding person who jumps to conclusions about people.  I believe in our Constitution.  That’s why I don’t like what the extreme rich people are doing to our country and it won’t be long before you will realize that I am right.  They are taking away all our rights.  
They sent away most of the manufacturing jobs so they could hire cheaper workers, then they brought in cheaper workers from Mexico to take the low paying jobs away from the blue collar workers.  If a man misses a day of work at some places, they’ll fire him! Do you think that’s the right thing to do?  Worker safety laws are being destroyed in this country!  There are no pensions left!  Medical insurance is being taken away from workers!  People are being evicted from homes that they’ve paid on for 20 years! 
They’re bringing 2 things to this country–corporate fascism and neo-feudalism.  Do you know what those are?  Higher taxes on the rich people are a lot nicer than either of those.  Just what do you find to be so bad about higher taxes on the rich anyway?  Do you want a crumbling infrastructure?  In my mom’s home town, the sewer system wasn’t fixed.  It ruined many houses, made them uninhabitable.  The city had to buy them.  Don’t you care what happens to the ordinary worker?  Don’t you care that there’s millions of American children going to bed hungry every night, that there’s more children living in poverty today than ever since the Great Depression?  Don’t you care about these things?  Or are you just interested in calling me, an elderly middle class lady, names?  Isn’t that kind of small of you?  I think the people’s lives matter more.  They certainly matter more to me!  I care about people!!!

American born citizens please read a real true story!
Dear Patriot,
We don’t talk about the first day of spring in 1974.  It’s been that way for as long as I could remember.  March 20th started off like any other as my 8 year old brother headed off to school wearing his blue ball cap and backpack. My mom remembers him yelling back into the house, ‘I Love You Mom” before shutting the door.
That was the last time she saw my brother, Cliff.
The Dekalb County Chief of Police told my mother we would never know what exactly happened in the bedroom of the nanny that afternoon.  The police report later revealed the nanny heard Cliff begging, “Please help me.” A shot rang out.  When she ran into the room it was too late.  Her 12-year-old son was standing over my brother’s lifeless body.  In his hands was his parent’s rifle, which he had just used to shoot my brother through the heart at point blank range.
The motive was never determined.  One suspicion was the boy was possibly jealous of the affection his mother showed my brother.  Cliff had been dubbed “The Mayor” by the neighborhood because of his outgoing personality. He spent many hours playing games with the seniors who lived in the complex. 
Losing Cliff was too much for my mother to bear. She had recently been divorced. Within the year before my brother’s murder, she had lost her father and mother to cancer. In a rare moment of remembrance she once told me that the loss of her parents was heartbreaking enough – but the loss of Cliff was so devastating that for years she wished every breath taken would be her last.
Last Monday, like so many parents of young children across America, I found an excuse to visit my child’s classroom.  As I stood outside the door of my son’s Kindergarten classroom before lunch, I heard his teacher remark to the class that there was a new rule: every classroom door was going to be closed and locked.  If someone came to the door, the students were to first get the teacher before opening even if it was a parent or a fellow student.
I fought back tears as I listened to the little voices ask questions regarding the new policy and a sense of anger was rekindled.  Ryan Lanza not only took the lives of 26 innocent victims on December 14th, but he also stole the security of many families across this nation.  Gone are the days where you could walk down a school hallway and hear a chorus of children’s voices, answering questions, or laughing at a story being read by their teacher.  Now, school hallways are becoming as sterile as the corridors of a hospital.  It makes one wonder if a child can really grow in such a cold, silent environment.
My anger turns to pain as I hear the children, excitedly lining up for lunch, debating over whose dessert was better or what side dish they were going to be serving.  I realized there were 20 sets of parents who were never going to hear the chatter or any other debate again from their child and I immediately thought of my mother.
While you might think my mother would be a strong anti- gun proponent, she realized it was not the guns’ fault for the death of Cliff. It was a failed system and irresponsible parenting who were as much to blame as anything.
As I grew up, my mother insisted I learned to defend myself.  If Cliff’s death had taught her anything it was that.  Whether it be hand to hand self-defense, environmental defense or with a gun, I have been raised to respect the power of a weapon I received the highest accuracy rating and grade in my concealed hand gun permit class. I also pride myself on better aim then my former Army officer husband.
Since the events of December 14th, there have been countless numbers of articles and interviews over gun owner’s rights, particularly from those opposed to them.  I am beginning to think those on the left were waiting for a tragedy like this to happen just so they could reignite the argument over gun control.  Taking the advice of Rahm Emanuel, they were quick to “not let a serious crisis go to waste.” 
The hypocrisy of their claims are amazing considering this is the same administration who put guns in the hands of Mexican drug lords to use against law enforcement.  The propagandists also cavalierly dismiss the numerous examples of public shooting sprees halted because of a legal gun permit holder’s actions for fear it would encourage legal gun ownership.
Real gun control looks like a land where upstanding, responsible, law abiding citizens actually carry their guns with them in almost any location.  Crimes are reduced based on the fact that criminals don’t know if their target is packing a weapon or not.    Real gun control looks like a competitive health care system where insurance agencies don’t determine the mental health status of a person rather than a doctor, and our politically-correct society allows dangerous people to be identified, labeled and hospitalized before they commit a crime.
Just look across the pond at countries like the UK and Norway that recently passed gun ownership restrictions.  Within those countries, the number of mass shootings has escalated because no one had any way to stop the offender.
Over the next few weeks, the left will use the shooting in Connecticut and the victims as pawns in their mission to inject more Federal Government control into our daily lives.  These same opportunists will try and discredit and shame anyone who speaks out in defense of their 2nd Amendment right I am very scared of a Country whose states continue to vote in the legal use of Marijuana yet strongly restrict the ability to defend yourself.
My mother never prosecuted the boy who shot Cliff. In fact, the day she left to bury my brother on our small farm in Illinois was the last day she ever saw the nanny’s child.  
I now have my own 6 year old son.  I like to imagine he has the same personality and spirit which shined bright in my brother.   My son will go to school after the first of the New Year to a learning environment much different from what he left in 2012. His classroom has been transformed more into a jail cell not to keep him locked in, but rather to keep the world locked out.
My child might not remember these differences down the road. But I will. Most of us will.  We will weep at the loss of this innocence and wonder how did our Country change from being a Norman Rockwell portrait to a scene from inside a horror film?
Evil will use whatever tools its needs to commit its crime.  We must remember in the next few months as the victims of Connecticut are used as propaganda by those who want to see evil prevail, their first move will be to take away from the virtuous their ability to defend and protect their own.

If you had read what I wrote you would understand my comment about you being an atheist. Religion and socialism are incompatible. Socialism puts all their faith in the state with no room for a deity. Of course I knew the atheist comment would spool you up, since you claim to be a socialist. It’s obvious you don’t know your history nor your real faith.
Your other comment about corporate fascism also shows your ignorance since this is still another form of socialism, whereby the means of production is still in the hands of the government.
Politically you’re a novice still spouting talking points from, it sounds like, Occupy wall street. Your class warfare rhetoric exposes you for the jealous bigotry you hold against anyone more successful than yourself. I’ll use one talking point on you and you won’t hear from me again. “You can’t make the poor rich by making the rich poor”. All socialism does is make everyone equally miserable. That is except for the socialists themselves. There will always be overlords in totalitarian systems like what you pine for.

Socialism has changed from what you believe it to be.  Moreover most Socialists today are not affiliated with any party.  What party?  There is no party.  We all vote Democrat.  Actually I don’t even know any other Socialists.  
This country is never going to be overrun by Socialists.  If you’re worried about that, you can just turn over and go back to sleep–ain’t gonna happen.  What IS liable to happen is that this country is going to spiral into a depression worse than the Great Depression.  And then you’re going to see mob riots, increased shootings throughout the country, God only knows where it will all end!  Scare you?  It scares me!
All I want is for everyone in this country to be decently fed, housed, clothed, have medical care and education.  Is that really too much to ask for?  It is what Jesus would have wanted.  It is what the more economically well off European countries do quite well.  The only ones that have a problem with it are the ones that were not that well off to begin with.
I don’t know where you’re deriving your definition of Socialism from but it’s not the one currently used in any of the European countries, I have relatives and friends in the Netherlands, and it’s not what most people mean by the term today.
Now as to religion; Capitalism is based on self-interest.  What is self-interest?  It is selfishness.  Selfishness is against everything Christianity has supposedly ever believed in.  The Bible said a camel could pass through the eye of a needle easier than a rich man could get into the kingdom of heaven.  What do you think it meant by this?  Did it mean that the rich people of our country should own almost all the wealth of our country as they do?  Or did it mean that we should tax them and spread it around for the good of the entire country?  Roman wasn’t conquered from without, you know.  It crumbled from within–and that’s what’s happening to our country.  Too much greed by a few people–causing too much misery for everyone else–and everyone nodding their heads happily and saying, “ya sir, ya sir, you sure do deserve all that money, sir.”  Would Jesus say so?  Would God?
And, by the way, Capitalism is the one putting all its faith in money, the almighty dollar, and none in people at all!!!  
Read a few more books on these subjects.  Read Who Stole the American Dream?  Because it has been stolen–by the 1% on top.
And, by the way, I have never trusted ANY government!!!!  I grew up in the corn fields of rural southern Illinois, a farmer’s daughter.  Where DO you come up with these ideas about people anyway?  Have you been watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer one time too many?

I know perfectly well what socialism/communism.fascism is. My grandparents escaped the depredations of totalitarian governments in the 1st part of the 20th century when they fled the Soviet Union. So don’t think to lecture me about what you have been led to believe is socialism. You really have swallowed the Kool Aid, still spouting off your class warfare rhetoric about the evil 1%. The chains are wrapped tightly around your mind, and only you have the key to free yourself. You are a product of the long view as discussed by Stalin and you don’t even realize it. You are a “useful idiot”, and a traitor to this nation and what it stands for. I’m sure you haven’t even read any of the founding documents. And even if you had, you are incapable of understanding the concept of our unalienable rights enshrined in the Constitution. You really need to go live in one of your socialist paradises like Cuba, Venezuela, or North Korea. Even in your precious European socialist countries and see the limits they’ve placed on human rights.
You have drunk deep of the Kool aid and you are lost. You are like the wild pig that has been caught by building a fence around it wall at a time so that it doesn’t realize it has been caught until too late. Socialism is totalitarian oppression no matter how you try to deny it. You can’t even see the class warfare that you spout to demonize one part of society against another. You are a willing accomplice to the enemies of freedom and you will be trampled under foot by which ever side succeeds. You are a fool and I pity you. I said it before and I’ll say it again You have been assimilated,and your mind is gone.

By all means, disagree because it’s expected on this issue and just about every other one these days, but really??  The ‘debate’ mostly consists of partisan attacks, threats of all kinds, name calling, slurs and downright nasty innuendo eagerly posted by all appearances, instead of making a case clearly, without remedy to the aforementioned methods of character assassination and intimidation? I could care less what side of the aisle you are on but quoting Mr Lincoln, “Tis better to be thought a fool, then to speak and remove all doubt “.absolutely goes both ways here.  How about instead, bring your brain to this fight, know your facts, your figures and have the courage of your convictions to support them, even if you’re the only one standing. As an American I can respect that.

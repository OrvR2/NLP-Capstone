Emphasizing high-quality instructional videos, Howcast brings you experts who provide accurate information in easy-to-follow tutorials on everything from makeup, hairstyling, nail art design, and soccer to parkour, skateboarding, dancing, kissing, and much, much more.Step 1: RunRun first; ask questions later. Don't miss your opportunity to escape by wasting time debating whether that noise was _really_ a gunshot. TipIf you're running from a shooter, run in a zigzag pattern. He'll have a harder time hitting you, and the odds are even lower he'll hit a major organ or artery.Step 2: Barricade the doorIf you're trapped in a building with a shooter, lock yourself in a room and barricade the door with heavy furniture. The predator is likely to move on to more accessible victims. Step 3: Find a weaponFind some sort of weapon -- a pair of scissors, a letter opener, hot coffee, a stapler, a fire extinguisher. Even if you don't injure the attacker, you may be able to distract him or throw him off balance. Step 4: Take coverTake cover behind something sturdy, like a file cabinet or a metal desk. TipDon't make eye contact with or speak to the shooter. But if he talks to you, respond with an absurd question in the hopes of throwing him off guard.Step 5: Listen for reloadingListen for the "click" that indicates his revolver is out of bullets, or the metallic clang that means the empty cartridge of his automatic pistol has fallen to the floor. He'll have to pause to reload, giving you and others a chance to tackle him or escape.  Step 6: Slow bleedingIf you do get shot, slow the bleeding by keeping direct pressure on the wound.TipIf you think you might pass out from blood loss, place a hard object under your body, just above the wound, and lay on top of it. That way, if you do lose consciousness, your body weight will keep pressure on the wound.Step 7: Fight backIf you find yourself unable to avoid a life-or-death struggle with the shooter, go for his most vulnerable areas: gouge his eyes with your index and middle fingers; jab his Adam's apple; or knee him in the groin. Step 8: Report odd behaviorHelp prevent shooting rampages in the first place by reporting any odd behavior or threats to someone in authority.Did You Know?Homicide is the second leading cause of death on the job, after motor vehicle accidents.

I live in Canada and we get like 1/4 of the murders America has because guns are banned. And﻿ yes it is impossible to get rid of all guns but guys if you try to get rid of them you will have 2/3 of the murders you had.

>carry assault rifles
Assault rifles are rare. In the event they are used in a crime (or even in self-defense) the owner might see it on an evidence locker. The fact that they are rare and cost several thousand dollars (M16 lower - about 15,000) means that *nobody* risks it.
Most people who carry do so with handguns as they are lighter and easier to conceal.
The rifles you are talking about are pure semi auto rifles.﻿ Legal in most countries.

the hell are you on about? Telling me about background checks the guns have to go through, and﻿ the price, thats not what the conversation is about. Im talking about civilians getting to carry assault rifles, (and whether there are laws, it still happens) in america. You were just talking a load of bullshit

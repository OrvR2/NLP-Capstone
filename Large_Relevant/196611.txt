BAGHDAD (AP) — A suicide bomber struck a packed funeral ceremony at a Shiite mosque in northern Iraq on Wednesday, killing at least 24 people and wounding dozens in an attack likely to further deepen the country's ethnic and sectarian rifts.
The bomber detonated his explosives at the Sayyid al-Shuhada mosque in Tuz Khormato as mourners marked the death of a government employee who was killed in a drive-by shooting a day earlier, according to witnesses. A number of provincial officials were among those hurt in the attack.
Mayor Shalal Abdoul said that 24 were killed and at least 50 people were wounded in the bombing.
The scene was chaotic at a nearby hospital where many victims were taken. Associated Press television footage showed medics rushing to treat some of the wounded on a blood-streaked floor as bystanders carried in more victims arriving in pickup trucks and the backs of compact cars.
Yalmaz Ogolu, the owner of a television channel in the nearby city of Kirkuk, said he was just leaving the funeral when the attack occurred.
"I heard a thunderous boom come from the mosque," he said. "Seconds later, I saw panicked people fleeing the mosque while others carried bodies and wounded people out."
"Police soon showed up and started shooting in the air," presumably to disperse the crowd in case of a follow-up blast, he said.
The attack underscores the challenges facing Iraq's government as it struggles to maintain law and order more than a year after the last U.S. troops left.
Wednesday marked at least the fifth time this month that insurgents managed to carry out attacks claiming more than 20 lives in a single day.
The bombing came a day after a string of attacks, including three car bombs in and around Baghdad, killed at least 23 people Tuesday.
The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad quickly condemned the bombing, saying it intentionally targeted men, women, and children.
"The deliberate targeting of innocent civilians is cowardly and reprehensible.  This attack is meant to incite others into violence and is harmful to the interests of all Iraqis," the embassy said.
The upsurge in violence has coincided with a wave of Sunni-led protests against Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Shiite-led government over what the Sunnis see as unfair treatment of their sect.
Ethnic tensions are also rattling Iraq's stability.
Tuz Khormato, where Wednesday's attack struck, sits in a band of territory contested by Arabs, Kurds and Turkomen.
The city was the scene of an exchange of fire in November that pushed the Iraqi government and the Kurds, who have their own armed force, into a military standoff along the disputed territories that has yet to be resolved.
Those wounded in Wednesday's attack include the deputy governor of Salaheddin province, Ahmed Abdul-Jabar, and provincial council member Ali Hashim Mukhtar, said Kirkuk mayor Munir al-Qafily, who was also hurt in the blast.
There was no claim of responsibility for the attack. But it bore the hallmarks of al-Qaida's local franchise, which often uses indiscriminate, high-profile killings to sow fear and undermine the government's authority.
Violence has fallen since the peak of the insurgency in Iraq several years ago, but lethal attacks launched primarily by Sunni extremists still occur frequently.
The attacks exacerbate Iraq's struggle to maintain stability amid a series of political crises that have wracked the country since the U.S. military withdrawal in December 2011.
Earlier in the day, a roadside bomb apparently intended for a passing police vehicle in Baqouba hit a minibus instead, killing one and wounding four, according to police.
In another attack near Fallujah, police gunmen killed a local leader of the Sahwa, a group of Sunni fighters who joined forces with the U.S. military to fight al-Qaida at the height of Iraq's insurgency. Sunni insurgents frequently target Sahwa members, because they consider them to be traitors.
A suicide bomber last week assassinated Sunni lawmaker Ifan Saadoun al-Issawi, who was one of the main founders of the Sahwa in Fallujah. A day later, a series of blasts struck the northern city of Kirkuk, which like Tuz Khormato is home to a mix of Arabs, Kurds and Turkomen, who all have competing claims to the oil-rich area.

Great to see how advanced Iraq has become after we illegally invaded, forced their leader to the gallows and left them to fend for themselves.   What exactly again was the point of going to Iraq?   Remember how Bush told us all about how the Iraq people wanted us there, wanted us to help take out Saddam and help them be a free country?   Yea as free as an anarchy.

I bet you poll those people again and they wouldnt want us anywhere near that country.

Once again, who really gained from 911?   Al Qaeda?  Nope,   Iraq?   Nope.  Terrorism?  Nope.   The US Government and all their buddy contractors?  Yep

The depravity of some sick animals is truly staggering. 

Back during the Civil War, it was not uncommon to see enemy soldiers walking only a few feet from each other as they gathered their dead ... even only mere hours after the deadly battle which had killed those people.

That is called humanity, morality, nobility, respect, honor and being CIVILIZED. And that was almost 150 years ago.

So what's up, terrorists? Are you so much less than human that you truly have completely lost sight of what is right and wrong ... even when it comes to your own people? As well, how many of those people you killed at that mosque were even combatants or legitimate enemies? (How many children did you say you killed again?)

Now (for the point) if what I understand about Shari'a Law is true, then which ever Muslim (yes, I am assuming it was a follower of Islam... but I could be wrong) carried out this act should realize how much trouble he is really in. In Shari'a Law, it is a war crime to attack non-combatants .. ESPECIALLY CHILDREN ... but the law also includes women and the elderly. The only exception to this law is if the child, woman, or old man has attacked the Muslim first. And I find that to be highly unlikely while they were attending a funeral.

Uphold your own morals and values if you want others to respect your ways.

Ethnic and sectarian rifts in the Middle East have never had, nor ever will have any regard for human life or death. It will never change.

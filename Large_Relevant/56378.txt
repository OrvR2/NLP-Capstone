MIDLAND CITY, Ala. - An unidentified man boarded a school bus, shot the driver several times, then escaped with a six-year-old passenger, prompting an hourslong standoff with police that remained unresolved early Wednesday.
The Dale County Sheriff told WBMA-TV that the man shot the driver in Midland City on Tuesday after he refused to let the child off the bus. The driver later died of his wounds. His identity wasn't released.
The shooter took the child to an area behind a nearby church, and police were negotiating with him, authorities said.
Midland City police would not comment, and a call to the Dale City Sheriff's office was not answered Tuesday.
Authorities from multiple agencies were on the scene and nearby residents were evacuated from their homes as a precautionary measure, said Rachel David, a spokeswoman for the police department in the nearby town of Dothan.
"Authorities also confirmed the presence of a child at the scene but are giving no further information at this time," David said in a news release late Tuesday.

Feeling outraged?? ... even more so??? 
so, as the growth of the USA's population in ratio to 'crimes committed' .... 
Here is another 'crime' ..... 69 years ago......
    The Hartford, Connecticut circus fire, which occurred on July 6, 1944, in Hartford, Connecticut, was one of the worst fire disasters in the history of the United States. The fire occurred during an afternoon performance of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus that was attended by approximately 7,000 people. An estimated 167-169 people died and over 700 were injured.
     Several men were implicated in this disaster ... One of the men, James A. Haley, went on to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives for twenty-four years.
     In 1950, Robert Dale Segee of Circleville, Ohio, claimed he was responsible for setting the circus fire. Segee, a roustabout for the show from June 30 to July 14, 1944, when he was about 14 years old, said he had a nightmare in which an Indian riding on a "flaming horse" told him to set fires. He further claimed that after this nightmare his mind went blank, and that he did not come out of this state until the circus fire had already been set. It was said Segee fitted the description of a serial arsonist right out of a psychiatrist's textbook. Segee also knew intimate details of the incident, which some believed only the real arsonist could have known. For instance, it was never made public that the circus had two smaller fires of undetermined origin prior to the tragedy. Segee admitted setting both of them as well. These statements, Segee added, were in response to a later dream he'd had of a woman standing in flames urging him to confess.
    In November 1950, Segee was convicted in Ohio of unrelated arson charges and sentenced to more than 40 years of prison time. However, Hartford investigators raised doubts over his confession, as he had a history of mental illness, and it could not be proven he was anywhere within the state of Connecticut when the fire occurred. Connecticut officials were also not allowed to question Segee, even though his alleged crime had occurred in their state. Additionally, Segee, who died in 1997, denied setting the fire as late as 1994 during an interview. Because of this, many investigators, historians, and victims believe the true arsonist—if it had indeed been arson—was never found.

Remember in the 80's when mental hospitals were closed due to governmental funding cutbacks during the Reagan years and the crazies were released among us?  The Feds cut the money and the states couldn't afford it amymore.   This policy has come back to bite us in the tender spots.  You can't get cheap with mental health even though it is not a 'moneymaker' .

The driver is a hero for not letting him have this kid.  How much to these drivers make for wages for what they do?

We can't go to the mall, movie theatre, or send our kids to school without worrying anymore for their safety. I want the world back that I grew up in where we could play in the street or fall out of a tree and all my mom had to worry about is a bruise or a broken bone.

Guns are not the problem. The guy could have stabbed the driver to death and then what, outlaw knives. Probably a domestic with again a young troublesome person overlooked by law enforcement. In CT if there is a domestic the police confiscate all firearms from the party involved untill resolution if there seems to be a problem.The NRA is just trying to preserve an American right.

After they get the child back, they should shoot the SOB who took him.

Crazy? "Stares right through you." People avoided him? I will also bet his gun is perfectly legal. Any takers?

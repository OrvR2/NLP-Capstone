People can say what they want.
I think it was selfish.
Have any of you stop to consider maybe some of the people held up by the bikers were going to an airport? going to a funeral? hell, maybe going to their own wedding...
it may have been daring and﻿ romantic- but it was also selfish and also potentially dangerous

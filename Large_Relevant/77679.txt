To you who is skeptical, it's pretty obvious how it works. The dry ice undergoes sublimation, which is the process in which a solid directly becomes a gas. The person puts a film of "bubble solution" over the entire opening area, and as the solid CO2 becomes gas, it expands and pretty much "blows" the bubble. And as always, the bubble film reaches a limit of its "stretchability" and it pops, releasing all﻿ the gas and creating the cool effect. Sometimes it isn't CGI, it's science.

That's a pretty cool thing to look at. I loved working with dry ice during chemistry. I think it'd﻿ be worth noting somewhere though that dry ice should only be handled while wearing a thick glove or with tongs for the people who want to try the experiment.

I am aware﻿ that the actual dry ice cannot touch your skin, but is the vapor itself dangerous at all? We were just discussing using dry ice last night for an upcoming photo shoot, and would like to get the model as close as possible to the bowl. Can you give me an idea of do's and dont's? Thanks for this.

Wal-Mart is the official poor people mall XD. You can get just about everything there.
If the dry ice is what you mean, you can get it from lots of different places. There are a﻿ few gas stations around where I live that you can get dry ice from if they've got too much. Hell, even the Braums here will give you some if you ask nicely. Just ask around, you'll usually find one store or another that can supply you.

The only thing that comes out of the bowl on the explosion is﻿ the dry ice fog and just a little bit of moisture. The only real mess is the soap that drips from the edge of the bowl onto the floor.

A lot of supermarkets carry dry ice﻿ (especially around Halloween time). Glycerin can be ordered from any pharmacy. It's pretty inexpensive. Does anyone know what role the glycerin plays?

Because I have done this without the﻿ Glycerin, I can say it looks like it increases the strength of the surface tension of the bubble.

The glycerin acts to hold the bubble together. When you use dishsoap to blow bubbles without it, they pop much easier and often you can't even form a stable bubble before﻿ they burst. All bubble liquids I know of have glycerin because it makes the bubbles stronger.

The glycerin, a very thick and viscous hydrophilic molecule, helps make the water layer a bit more sticky so the bubble can get bigger﻿ before becoming unstable

Why don't you make it so the edges of the bowl are equal to it's surroundings? It seems the bubble breaks when it gets over the﻿ edge. If the edge is equal it can perhaps go on much larger?

You can buy dry ice at a grocery store and glycerine at health shops as Vegetable Glycerine. Glycerine is﻿ a moisturiser and people use it when they make homemade soaps. Go check the ingredients on your liquid hand soap.

Honestly, that was﻿ an amazing experiment. What made it spectacular, was 1 your music and 2 your editing. The whoosh sounds and the cut outs in the music made this video truly a work of art. Well done my friend!

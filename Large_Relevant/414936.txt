Absolutely﻿ futile; It was all over long before they ever took a sledgehammer to the first block. Look at the video for The Station Nightclub fire. From the point of ignition, the first deaths occurred in about two minutes. Within 6 minutes, anybody who wasn't outside was dead from smoke inhalation or burns. Most frightening video I've ever seen. It happens with amazing speed....

They were breaking the wall to release some of the smoke, because the fire fighters couldn't see a thing inside and﻿ couldn't breath well, even with gas masks

when will people learn that setting off fireworks indoors is a bad idea? the 2 other major nightclub fires(in US+RU) that also killed 100+ people each were also caused by fireworks.... is anyone seeing a pattern here? i mean it﻿ even has the name FIRE in it, FIRE-WORKS..... who would let it off in a nightclub full of people? you might as well throw a grenade in there

Luke 13:6-9
Jesus said: “A man planted a fig tree in his garden & came again & again to see if there was any fruit on it, but he was always disappointed. Finally, he said to his gardener, I’ve waited three years﻿ & there hasn’t been a single fig! Cut it down. It’s just taking up space in the garden. The gardener answered, Sir, give it one more chance. Leave it another year & I’ll give it special attention & plenty of fertilizer. If we get figs next year, fine. If not, then you can cut it down”

This happened 9 years ago in Argentina (December, 2004). Almost 200 people killed due to fireworks in a night﻿ club called Cromañon.

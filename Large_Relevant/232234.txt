Bugaboo baby strollers with potentially defective carry handles and a line of children's pajama sets that don't meet flammability standards are among the consumer products recalled this week. Others include defective cookware and air misters.
BABY STROLLERS
DETAILS: Bugaboo International Cameleon and Donkey baby strollers. The Cameleon strollers were sold between Sept. 2009 and June of 2012 and include the following serial numbers: 04011090900001 to 04031101009999, 08011090900001 to 08021100800386, and 140100093600531 to 140103123350418. The Donkey models were sold between Jan. 2011 and Dec. 2012 and include serial numbers 170101105300001 to 170104130900500. Serial numbers are printed on the stroller's chassis, located under the carrycot/seat.
WHY: A button on the stroller's carrycot/seat carry handle can become disengaged and cause the handle to detach, posing fall and choking hazards to young children.
INCIDENTS: 58 reports of carry handles detaching, but no injuries reported.
HOW MANY: About 46,300 in the U.S. and 4,440 in Canada.
FOR MORE: Consumers can contact Bugaboo for a free replacement handle. Call Bugaboo at 800-460-2922 or visit www.bugaboo.com and click on "Important Quality Initiative" for more information. Consumers can send email to the firm at serviceus(at)bugaboo.com
PAJAMAS SETS
DETAILS: Target Corp.'s Circo and Xhilaration children's cotton or cotton/fleece two-piece pajama sets. They were made by Makalot Garments Co. Ltd. of Taiwan and sold in infant and toddler sizes 12M, 2T, 3T, 4T and 5T, and in girls and boys sizes XS, S, M, L and XL. There are a variety of colors and designs, including stars, dots, skulls, peace signs, cats, owls, footballs and camouflage. To see a complete list of item numbers included in this recall, visit the firm's website. The item number is located on a tag on the shirt's side seam and on the pants at the waist. A tag printed on the neck of the pajamas reads "Circo" or "Xhilaration", "Wear snug-fitting not flame resistant" and the item number. They were sold from August 2012 through November 2012.
WHY: The pajamas sets fail to meet the federal flammability standards for children's sleepwear, because they do not meet tight-fitting sizing requirements. That poses a burn hazard to children.
INCIDENTS: None reported.
HOW MANY: About 560,000.

0718:


Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the ongoing violence between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. International efforts to finalise a truce in Gaza are being stepped up after a night of heavy Israeli air strikes and sporadic Hamas rocket attacks. Stay with us for the latest updates, incorporating reports from our correspondents on the ground, expert analysis, and your reaction from around the world, which you can send via email, text or twitter. We'll publish what we can. 


 

0721:


The Israel Defense Forces say that overnight, they targeted "dozens of terror infrastructure sites throughout the Gaza Strip". The targets included the Ministry of Internal Security which the IDF says "served as one of the main command and control centers for the Hamas terror organization". 


 

0723:

Jeremy Bowen
BBC Middle East editor



There should be no surprise that Israel has kept up its air strikes in Gaza despite the talks going on to achieve a truce. Israel has a twin track policy of doing both... Both sides have a stake in trying to get a truce going - they have made their points and if they continue with this things will get worse... But people absolutely don't know what is going to happen - it is the type of situation where you can't predict what is going to happen even an hour from now. 


 

0725:

Jon Donnison
BBC News, Gaza



More than 20 Palestinians were killed yesterday across Gaza including at least 3 children. There were more casualties here overnight. In Israel, one soldier and one civilian were killed yesterday. Gaza's streets this morning are again empty. People are trying to protect themselves at home and following the news on televsion. They're still waiting for something positive and concrete from Cairo. 


 

0728:


This is a picture of the destroyed compound of the internal security ministry in Gaza that the IDF said (0721) it hit overnight.


 


 


Michael, in Rishon Lezion, Israel,



emails: If the Arab League does not sign up to the cease fire then we are just waiting for another round to happen. The world seems to forget that 20 countries are still officially at war with Israel and have not signed a cease fire. 


 

0734:


As in virtually every modern conflict, there is intense debate on the legality of the actions of the two sides involved here. Guglielmo Verdirame, from the Department of War Studies at King's College London, gives his views of the the legal positions of Israel and Hamas to the BBC News website.

0743:


Haaretz reports that a short time ago, a rocket barrage was fired towards Ashkelon and the Eshkol Regional Council. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system intercepted three out of the five rockets fired toward Ashkelon and the Eshkol missiles fell in open ground, Haaretz says. 


 

0752:


Israeli armoured personnel carriers wait in a staging area on the Gaza border, as talks continue to try to bring about a ceasefire.


 


 


Uri, in Ashdod, Israel,



emails: Just came back from the shelter after another rocket alarm and boom. The situation really challenges my position in regards to the conflict as an Israeli. It pains me to think about the Palestinian children and uninvolved people hurt by my country's forces but these same people are supporting a government who's policy is to blindly throw as many rockets as possible on civilian population. There's no solution to this paradox. That's life in the Middle East, I guess.

Confirmation that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has begun talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank. News agency AFP's take on the meeting is that while Mr Abbas does not have "any practical influence in Gaza", his West Bank government would be instrumental in implementing any new arrangements on the Gaza border that would be part of a cease-fire pact.

Ghada Snunu, in Gaza,



blogs: "As the Israeli offensive enters its seventh day, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are running out of basic necessities needed for their survival, including food and clean drinking water. Private vendors selling desalinated water have stopped delivery of water due to ongoing air strikes and fear for their safety." 


 


Jeremy Bowen
BBC Middle East editor



There's no reason to suppose a new ceasefire would last, unless there's a change in the political equation between the two sides- if in exchange for the lifting of the Israeli blockade on Gaza, Hamas would agree to stop firing rockets. But a leap of faith would be required by both sides, and a way to present any deal to their respective publics as a victory - it would be a complex deal. At a time when people are being killed, and there's a massive lack of trust, it's a tall order. 


 

0856:


The Israeli army has been ordered to continue strikes on Gaza regardless of ceasefire talks, Voice of Israel radio reports at 0800, as heard by BBC Monitoring. IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz is quoted as saying the ceasefire contacts in Cairo do not affect the IDF's operations.

Jonathan, in Jerusalem,



emails: Celebratory gunfire after a bus bombing tells you all you need to know about which side is acting humanely and which is not. Even if you accept the fundamentally flawed argument that Palestinians have no option other than terror, to celebrate the death and injury of civilians is completely unjustifiable. Even in the most bombarded and terrorised areas of southern Israel the residents would never throw a party to celebrate loss of innocent life in Gaza.

More detail on Channel 10's report on a unilateral Israel ceasefire has come in. Their defence correspondent Alon Ben David reports that following a long discussion in Netanyahu's nine-member kitchen cabinet, they decided that an agreement on Israel's terms could not be achieved and Israel would unilaterally declare a ceasefire.

tells the BBC: "There is lots of talk about reaching a peace and today's bus bomb in Tel Aviv. Yesterday there was the frequent sound of sirens. My wife is seven months pregnant with our first child but she is in hospital because doctors fear she may lose the baby. Everyone wants the rockets to stop as they are making us miserable. I have friends and family who have left their homes in more violent areas to stay in Jerusalem because they feel safer here. But I don't know when there will be peace."

Since Hamas took over internal control of the Gaza Strip from their Palestinian rivals Fatah in 2007, there've been many spasms of cross border violence. All have been followed by ceasefires. All have fallen apart, and everytime Israel and Hamas blame each other. 
The reason is that the ceasefires have been, to paraphrase a spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister, sticking plaster solutions. They cover up the fundamental problem which is that Hamas and Israel are in what amounts to a constant state of war. For months on end it can be a cold war, until it runs hot and deadly again. There's a strong chance that a new ceasefire would eventually fall apart too. Unless it brought with it a major change in the political equation between Israel and the Palestinians, especially those in Gaza

Manuel Hassassian, the Palestinian diplomatic representative in Britain, told the BBC: "If the United States is serious about a two state solution, if they are serious about resolving this conflict and not crisis management... I think this is the time where we can test the honest broker of peace, the United States, to put pressure on Israel and to get President Abbas and Netanyahu at a negotiating table. And, let's not look at Gaza separately from the West Bank. It's one entity."

We will continue to cover the situation through the night on the BBC News website and our correspondents will bring you live updates on Twitter.

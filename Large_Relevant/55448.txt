Sandy Hook 'truthers' harass Newtown man, conspiracy theories go viralSandy Hook truthers have attacked Gene Rosen, who took in six terrified children right after the shooting. The conspiracy theories stem from a distrust of government and media, among other things.By Laura Edwins | Christian Science Monitor – Wed, Jan 16, 2013

With talk of a second shooter, Israeli death squads, and connections to “The Dark Knight Rises,” the Sandy Hook shooting has joined the ranks of other tragedies associated with conspiracy theories.
Just days after 20 first-graders and six adults were shot and killed at the school in Newtown, Conn., alternative theories and wild claims began circulating. In recent days, one Newtown man who helped survivors of the shooting has come under attack.
Some of the conjectures have arisen out of distrust of the government and media outlets. In other cases, they've gotten traction because they offer an explanation, when the "why" of the shooting has been elusive. A desire to deflect blame, for example away from guns, could also be at work.

In almost all instances, the Internet has been key to the claims' proliferation.
“The Web seems to be the new home of the conspiracy theory. It’s where conspiracy theories live, because the Web is so good at virally spreading around these kinds of little stories,” says Jeffrey L. Pasley, an associate professor of history at the University of Missouri in Columbia, where he teaches a class on conspiracy theories.
Individuals questioning the mainstream account of events have already been dubbed Sandy Hook truthers. They're turning to websites like SandyHookHoax.com, questionable photos, and YouTube videos that take issue with reporting on the day of the shooting.
Get our FREE 2013 Global Security Forecast now One person the truthers have zeroed in on is Gene Rosen, a Newtown man who took in six terrified students the morning of the shooting. He gave interviews to various media outlets afterward, and since then, he's been accused of being an actor paid to play a part. Fake Facebook profiles have been created in his name, and footage of the interviews with him has been edited and reposted, purportedly proving that Mr. Rosen is an actor.
“I don’t know what to do,” Rosen, a retired psychologist, told Salon. “I’m getting hang-up calls, I’m getting some calls, I’m getting e-mails with, not direct threats, but accusations that I’m lying, that I’m a crisis actor, ‘How much am I being paid?' ”
The underlying theme in all the theories is that the media, the government, and Obama administration specifically either manipulated or orchestrated the shooting to move political opinion on gun control. In particular, a comprehensive truther video focuses on discrepancies in initial reporting about the number and types of guns used by Adam Lanza.
Conspiracy theories are often used as a way of deflecting blame, Professor Pasley says. “If you’re a gun owner, you don’t want it all blamed on your group. So you adopt a conspiracy theory that blames it on someone else,” he says.
“Naturally people start coming up with different stories that aren’t about how having a house full of weapons is likely to lead to some sort of tragedy,” Pasley adds.
With the enormity of the shooting, it was apparent that gun violence was going to be in the national spotlight, writes LiveScience columnist Benjamin Radford.
"No one, regardless of what side of the gun control issue they are on, can deny that guns played a key role in the Sandy Hook killings," he writes. "So the conspiracy theorists must instead challenge the claim that the attack even occurred."
Indeed, some truthers have questioned whether the shooting happened at all. Many of these doubts came about because of inaccurate or muddled reporting in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. 
On Dec. 20, James Tracy, a Florida Atlantic University tenured professor of communication, wrote a well-sourced blog post, and later gave media interviews, arguing that contradictions in initial reporting proved that the Sandy Hook shooting was simply a “made-for-television storyline.” He placed responsibility with the mass media, saying they blindly believed and reported what officials told them.
After public criticism of Professor Tracy and the university, he backpedaled a bit, insisting his blog post was simply a way to encourage news consumers to think critically. But he still implied he takes issue with the basic facts that were reported about the shooting.
At least so far, mass media have not delved much into the claims surrounding Sandy Hook. CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, for one, has criticized Tracy and other truthers. Although other media outlets have reported the harassment of Rosen in detail, The Atlantic is one of the few news organizations to actually parse some of the theories and debunk them. It tackled the theory of a second shooter, reporting that a man whom police had initially pursued was most likely the father of a Sandy Hook student who was on the school grounds after the shooting.
Other media outlets, notably The New York Times, apologized for inaccurate reports when news of the shooting broke. Much of the “evidence” cited by conspiracy theorists is reporting that was later clarified.
Mr. Radford theorizes that while most observers understand that inaccurate reporting happens immediately after a chaotic event, the conspiratorial mind sees contradictions as "misinformation and lies," or holes in the official story.
Yet for some people, conspiracy theories can serve an important purpose, says Pasley, who has taught and studied such claims off and on since 1997.
“Conspiracy theories do have a function,” he says. “They are an explanation of the inexplicable, a sort of explanation that neatly puts into a box events that are extremely disturbing or tragic.”
They may be a way of "neutralizing" tragic events in the minds of theorists, Pasley adds.

Things to research for yourself because the media will not.
#1: 2-3 people were arrested around Sandyhook school, one chased into woods and caught by police on helicopter footage then put in FRONT seat of cop car, one caught in front of firehouse seen by kid from class, report of fleeing mini-van in area not caught.
#2: Lanza kill order, police audio scanner ordering "take" or "end" "the life of Adam"
#3: Vicki Soto having a FB page posted for her with green ribbons on Dec 10, before the event.
#4: United Way posted a condolence page for SandyHook days before the event
#5: Teacher saw 2 shadows pass her room
#6: Principal was interviewed, then reported dead. Who was this person?
#7: School nurse of 15 years interviewed on TV, talked about Nancy as a wonderful teacher, who was this person since the new story is Nancy was never a teacher?
#8: Ryan reported involved due to his VALID ID in his brothers pocket - the brother he had not seen in years, how did this happen?
#9: Ryans girlfriend reported kidnapped. Body reported in NJ. What happened there, who died?
#10: R o b Pa rk er was caught on film laughing before hearing "we are rolling" when he proceeds to cry, seems very unnatural for someone who JUST lost their child.
#11: Poz ner's fam was posting a donation page and having rival donation pages pulled off the net the day of the event before confirmation of his death, very unnatural.
#12: No parents have red eyes, no parents have bags under their eyes, no parents seem distraught, no parents seem exhausted, none are hysterical, no siblings as well
#13:  A mother had 7 pages taken down for using illegally taken pics of her still living daughter and using them as a supposed victim, the sites now use a different girls pic.
#14: Em's aunt unable to remember if her sisters were older or younger
#15: Em caught on Obamas lap in a pic wearing the same dress as her fam pic, when her younger sister is clearly visible in the pic and makes it easy to discern which is which
#16: old man doing baphomet horns in Vicki soto pic, Em Parker doing baphomet horns in a pic, anderson and nobama getting owl pictures as souvenirs (if you know symbolism)

Ayn Rand said: "They want to make us all criminals." Because you don't want to defend the rights of people you don't like, and everybody hates a convict. SO, you all say nothing as their second amendment RIGHT is denied them. Then you allow this sex offender registry where a guy can get pull off on a deserted road at night take a leak and become an instant sex offender for exposure because some cop happens along, or a guy could get drunk and duck behind a bush in the dark and have the misfortune of having a cop chance upon him and now another person's constitutional rights are violated. Once you allow them to start down that path, they'll keep going. Hitler said, "say you are doing it for the children, you can get away with ANYTHING."  They'll keep chipping away at everyone's rights, group by group, right by right, until there is no one left to defend YOUR rights.

It has been proven conclusively that Sandy Hook was planned.  That is the ONLY logical explanation for websites related to it being created days before the incident.  The majority of the evidence indicates it was nothing more than a drill, with the exception of the murders.  We have dead children showing up on Obama's knee at a news conference.  Rosen is an actor.  Look up Northwoods.  The govt got hijacked a long, long time ago.  The enemy has slowly been putting THEIR people into positions of power and authority for decades.  Getting down to the wire, folks.  Be prepared

99% of the anti-gun comments are by paid trolls. You can see this most clearly when they actually engage in debate. They have an agenda because their massahs have an agenda. Safe bet most of them are not American. You can tell by their ignorance, like one #$%$ who expressed the belief the constitution is 100 years old, or their gross misspelling, not understanding American culture. Yes, I know at first glance that sounds paranoid. That's what I thought when I was told about paid trolls. But I started paying attention (it helps if you can think for yourself) So, seriously, analyze their posts and think about it. That is why it is pointless to argue with them. I'm not saying you shouldn't prove them wrong, just saying they aren't going to change their position because they are paid to make these posts. They already know they are wrong.

And then they have her parents interviewed. It shows that they're all actors. It never really happened, because the guy that was supposedly her dad, is shown in the video where he's to the side and he's laughing and joking with other people and then he's called up in front of the camera. He's off to the left. Then he's called to the center, to the focus of the camera to be interviewed and to give his speech about Sandy Hook and about his daughter. And he goes from on the side from laughing and joking with everybody, he comes up to the center and ... he takes the joking, smiling face off and you can see him physically trying to force his face to look sad and then he starts talking about how his daughter's been killed. They're actors. There were no bodies.

The people in charge say things like "Don't let a serious crisis go to waste" so what do you expect other than distrust, it's not that this event didn't take place it's the fact they exploit it for political gain. Our government is usurping the Constitution and Bill of Rights.

Get onto "We The People" and sign the petition to release the Sandy Hook video. "Truthers" should do it to prove themselves right.. and "trusters" should do it to prove the "truthers" wrong. There is no reason not to sign it if you truthfully believe your position on this.

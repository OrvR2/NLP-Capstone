Went to see Cactus in the very early 70s. The MC comes out and says "Due to unforseen problems Cactus will not be able to play tonight". Moan from the crowd.
"But we called around and found a band to replace them on short notice. Would Humble Pie be acceptable?" YAY from the crowd.
Never saw﻿ Cactus but HP rocked.

I remember in 82 or 83 we went to Hara Arena to watch the "Pie" open for BOC.
We were hanging on the front﻿ of the stage when Pie came out (festival seating,those were the days}anyway,Marriott had no sooner put his guitar on,when he spit a big hocker on the stage, counted four,and the band kicked into I Don't Need No Doctor,the elapsed time from walking on stage till the first note was struck couldn't have been more than10sec.It was like getting hit between the eyes with a sledgehammer.I miss him

Somebody forgot to﻿ tell Steve's vocal cords that he was a 5 foot 5 white boy. What a voice that little guy had. And he was no slouch with that guitar either.

Man, I LOVED this album. Yes boys and girls, digital wasn't available to us dinosaurs yet but ya know what?.....vinyl was﻿ and still is the best way to listen to music. It actually required a diamond! Digital requires electricity.
Peter Frampton didn't change that much did he from his earlier day?

nope, its a known fact that Marriot left a successful Small Faces to pursue his muse in Humble Pie that was only marginally successful and died when Frampton got tired of not being able to pay the bills and dealing with the drug fused antics of﻿ Steve...do your homework , son!

Does Stevie's antic have anything to do with this being a great band?? I think not. So Frampton couldn't pay his bills, big frigging deal. This band carried on without him. I would suspect Steve would have gotten tired of Frampton singing flat all the﻿ time. Homework?? There isn't anything you can tell me I don't all ready know. As a musician for 46 years I know my stuff. I also don't go to a video of someone and degrade the band. If you don't like them what were you doing at the site anyway?

Fuck You
Frampton left because his style and writing were not hard enough to be hard rock.(listen to Shine On).
Steve wanted a harder sound,and Peter didn't fit,so﻿ he went off to make that"Frampton Comes Alive" pussy pop-rock shit.

If you listen to Frampton's shit with The Herd it was REAL "poppy". Frampton could play, though, and Marriott knew it. Also, the Herd were super huge in Britain, as were the Small Faces,﻿ add Ridley from Spooky Tooth and its a prescription for greatness.

Marriott did have a problem with alcohol, but give the man a break, he's dead. He also was one of, if not THE finest white blues-rock/R&B singers EVER. Look at what he did in The﻿ Small Faces....extraordinary.

Gotta love and respect anyone who recognizes their error. I saw The Pie open for Zappa in 1970 at Cleveland Public Hall and I was amazed at how all that voice could emanate from such a small dude.He truly kicked my﻿ 14 year old ass that night and won a fan for life.

I saw their final concert at Long Beach Arena from the third row. We were standing and someone in the back kept yelling to sit down. We turned to the back, yelled $%#@ing stand up and it was a stage rush after that. The yellow shirt bouncer dudes﻿ just moved out of the way. Great night.

This song kicks ass. I kind of missed Humble Pie when they were around, spending my time on Boston, Bad Company, BTO, and Frampton solo. Man, I missed out, and I got some catching up to do. This﻿ is one of the grittiest, raunchiest rock songs about drugs EVER.

Hit me with a rock if you want to, ..but i just had a thought that HP is a bit like Crazy Horse out in Santa Cruz. I saw Steve in SC, and the waitress put down her tray to dance!!! ..they were BOTH hot!! ..Neil Young rocks, too, ..and stretches the "conventions", just like Steve, ..but I give the edge﻿ to Steve for EXACTLY the spirit he dances to a 3:45 here! ..THAT spirit can not be "reproduced", ..can not be "pretended". Steve simply enjoyed his work!!!

@Mr. Barnard. Know what you mean, brother. But getting old means you were there! I wouldn't change places with the young folks today for anything. I feel sorry for them (pardon my sayin', young people- no offense intended)! To put it another way, if Mr. Satan came 'round tonight and offered to make me young (for his usual price), I could only say that if he meant make me﻿ young today-No Way! Now if he meant to send me back to the 70's , that's fine and I'd sign on the line!

You said it! lol SUCKS. Back then; maybe they could keep you 30 days in the hole but since then they've established some guidelines.(Not all staff abide by them..as you and I unfortunately know.)Admin Seg everybody seems to know exactly who's in the hole, when they were rolled out to go thereTen (10) days is max amount of time NOW. has been for a decade at least. BUT as you may also know they get around that TOO.10 days in: Roll you out to a different mod for 12﻿ hrs. roll you back in. THE TOUR

continued- This song KICKS! I've loved this song since﻿ I was 13 and Still do. Unfortunately you & I & a hell of alot more know what they're singing about not sure if they really did or just heard it thru the grapevine but no matter what this song is HOT! Before I had the 'pleasure' of experiencing it; when I'd hear this song I'd think of a Rip Van Winkle looking dude like the cover of Megadeth's 'Countdown to...' except chained hanging from the wall of a dongeon like Medieval times, lol HA! ;)

Humble Pie were even more influenced by The Band than the Stones.
And there﻿ was also Pete's guitar playing influenced by jazz masters like Django Reinhardt. :-) They had many, many influences.
As for AC/DC - they were as much influenced by Humble Pie as by Small Faces. SF in fact were their heroes (along with the Stones and The Who) when they were teenagers.

This would be a painful decision, but if I could have one wish of a 60's mod rockers voice (and the two best choices are obvious least for getting laid purposes ;) ) I'm afraid I would take Steve Marriott's over Rod Stewart's. Both awesome gravel soul brother sounds. But Marriott could have knocked over a﻿ ten story building with that wail if he wanted to. RIP Steve.

I﻿ fell hook, line, and sinker when Jerry Shirley went to the floor tom in verse two. I wanted to be able to make people feel as good as those thirty seconds made–and still make–me feel.

Other early great tunes of theirs: 'The﻿ Light' and 'Shine On'...in fact that entire album is pure gold ... listen to the vocals on 'A Song For Jenny' (not sure if its on the tube or not).
How Greg wound up a DJ (Detroit ??) ... I mean these guys were freakin great !! Saw 'em in nYC several times - true party band !!

@60srecords,It was Hashish & some had opium mixed in - very potent. I was in Germany during that﻿ time - 1971-73.

Steve Mariot does this song i ~1985-1986 and he says Red Lebanese & Black Nepalese, as this rendition also does. Red Lebanese could also have opium mixed in, but usually not if I remember correctly. Use was rampant back then all over Europe,& in the militaries of many nations﻿ including the USA & USSR, NATO & the Warsaw Pact, & with civilians.

I remember blond Lebanese, it was just hash, so yes Black Nepalese, was opium, I think I smoked that twice. What great lyrics!﻿ "Take a greasy whore and a rolling dance floor..." Words gone by, you don't here those kind of lyrics anymore.

@60srecords, Actually, he's saying 'black Nepalese',﻿ which was also either pure dark colored hashish or hash with opium mixed in. "Newcastle Brown, it will sure SMACK you down ...' refers to Heroin as SMACK = Heroin. Actually, Humble Pie was somewhat anti-drug as at least one of their other songs (forget which one, but I think a famous USA black lady singer(s) sing with them in at least 1 song).

Someone band or artist should make a new version of this song. They could include the new strain names, like Sour Diesel, Strawberry Cough, etc.﻿ I suppose though for anyone in the U.S. that lives in a decriminalized state the song title would have to be changed to 100 bucks in the hole.

I wonder if Peter Frampton was having second thoughts about leaving these guys when this album came out,﻿ considering it was the band's biggest success and a pretty solid record. Probably not, though, as he was set on doing his own thing and look where it got him. I mean "Frampton Comes Alive" is still one of the highest selling live albums of all time to this day.

My fave song by this band. LOVE blues, classic rock combined with blues,﻿ even better. Plus the hippie look really gets me going, love the long haired rockers.

 One of the indie bands ( I can't remember the name right now ) they play on our local radio station can only play two chords, they have a singer that can't sing a single note in﻿ tune and a drummer that just thrashes about unable to either find, or keep a beat, and the rappers aren't any better. The people who market music to us must have their heads stuck firmly up their asses. There can't be any other reason for the crap that's out now.

He could have sold out﻿ with pretentious 'heavy' lyrics (been more popular with the young ladies) but he stuck with what he did best - balls to the wall, good time party R&R so they didn't achieve mystical status like Plant/Zep for example.When the 3rd keg was tapped and guys got sick of catering to the ladies choices (Elton/Stevens etc) invariably this tape came out and all hell would break loose! Head bangin', mud rollin' fuckin' bark at the moon good time rock and rollin (preACDC)

Thanks to youtube now the﻿ younger crowd, Who want to escape from Bebermania, can now learn who Marriott was& that all the stories are true, it's not a myth, People really did sing & played there own instrument back then. Back then it took more than having a pretty face or flashing your twat getting out of a car ! You needed talent. So hopefully with the help of youtube & some talented kids this type of music will come back! converse & hip huggers did ! There is hope.

I saw Good Bye Pie and Robin Trower and am so happy I went. To see that short dude swig some whiskey, spit across the stage, and then belt out the tunes he did was awesome. At the top of their game, Humble Pie followed Robin Trower, the warm up band and performed their final act. Blew me away. Never﻿ will I be entertained as I was that night. Greatness. Great songs, fun, memories.

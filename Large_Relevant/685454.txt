SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif. (AP) — After a year of gathering dust and negative headlines, the troubled San Onofre nuclear power plant shows stirrings toward a possible restart, though big barriers remain, officials said.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission senior inspector Greg Warnick said the agency is beginning to prepare a detailed plan of what would need to be done to bring San Onofre safely back to service.
The seaside plant between San Diego and Los Angeles hasn't produced electricity since a tiny radiation leak led to the discovery of excessive wear on hundreds of steam generator tubes that carry radioactive water in January 2012.
Workers for Southern California Edison are visiting other plants this week to become familiar with working conditions after a year with San Onofre on the sidelines.
"The equipment isn't used to operating at power, but the people aren't used to it either," Warnick said Monday.
Edison has asked the NRC for permission to restart one of the reactors, Unit 2, and run it at reduced power. A decision isn't expected until at least March.
NRC chair Allison Macfarlane toured the plant Monday and told reporters she's "concerned about the situation."
The trouble at San Onofre centers on steam generators that were installed during a $670 million overhaul in 2009 and 2010. After the plant was shut down, tests found some generator tubes were so badly worn that they could fail and possibly release radiation, a stunning finding inside nearly new equipment.
In effect, what was intended to be an upgrade that would extend the plant's operating life for years could instead cut it short — or even end it.
Macfarlane, who is not directly involved in the restart decision, promised a thorough review of Edison's proposal. She defended the agency against criticism that it was silencing the public in the review.
She said no decision would be made to restart the plant until "we are sure they can operate safely."
As Edison waits for a decision on a restart, the plant faces a host of lingering issues. The future of the heavily damaged Unit 3 reactor is not known — its nuclear fuel has been removed. Environmental groups are challenging various aspects of Edison's plans.
It's also not known if the damaged generators can be repaired and operated at full power.
"I don't know where that's going," said NRC Deputy Regional Administrator Art Howell, who heads the agency team overseeing San Onofre.
Friends of the Earth, a group critical of the nuclear power industry, is among several environmental organizations pushing the NRC to require Edison to seek an amendment to its operating license to restart the plant, a process that would involve court-like hearings and could take up to two years.
The generators, which resemble massive steel fire hydrants, control heat in the reactors and operate like a car radiator. At San Onofre, each one stands 65 feet high, weighs 1.3 million pounds and has 9,727 U-shaped tubes inside, each three-quarters of an inch in diameter.
Cracked and corroded generator tubing has vexed the nation's nuclear industry for years.
Decaying generator tubes helped push San Onofre's Unit 1 reactor into retirement in 1992, even though it was designed to run until 2004. The following year, the Trojan nuclear plant, near Portland, Ore., was shuttered because of microscopic cracks in steam generator tubes, cutting years off its expected lifespan.
San Onofre is owned by SCE, San Diego Gas & Electric and the California city of Riverside. The Unit 1 reactor operated from 1968 to 1992, when it was shut down and dismantled.

I don't care about the power plant, just save the San Onofre Nude Beach.

Most readers don't understand that this was a major engineering and legal fiasco. The steam generator has U-shaped tubes roughly 135 feet long through which high pressure, high temperature slightly radioactive water rapidly flows to create steam by boiling water on the outsides of the tubes.
The problem arose with the new steam generators (SG) because the utilities and new manufacturer Mitsubishi illegally* changed the design -- more tubes to create more steam, inadequate tube support against vibration, and cheaper alloy (lower in nickel). Mitsubishi underestimated the fluid flow rates by a factor of 3 or 4 in their computer modeling of the new design. Excessive vibration caused fretting corrosion (rubbing abrasion), with the new tubes wearing out in less than 2 years vs. 26-28 years for the original design manufactured by Combustion Engineering..

*Illegal because it wasn't a 'like-for-like' replacement; a new designed legally required NRC approval of engineering changes and public hearings which the utilities wanted to bypass.

The NRC is the Biggest Joke in our Government,they don't represent the American people that's for sure,they allowed plants to be built on earthquake fault lines, in populated areas,and allow plants that were suppose to close years ago to continue to run!

That plant is a dissaster waiting to happen.  Shut it down before it's too late!

[Mr. Burns is reminiscing about his grandfather's old Atom Smashing Plant]
Burns' Grandfather: Come on, men! Smash those atoms! You there, turn out your pockets.
[Two goons seize a waifish worker and turn out his pockets]
Burns' Grandfather: Aha - atoms! One, two, three, four... SIX of them! Take him away!
Waif: You can't treat the working man this way! One of these days we'll form a union, and get the fair and equitable treatment we deserve! Then we'll go too far, and become corrupt and shiftless, and the Japanese will eat us alive!
Burns' Grandfather: The Japanese? Those sandal-wearing goldfish tenders? Ha ha! Bosh! Flimshaw!
Mr. Burns: Oh, if only we'd listened to that young man, instead of walling him up in the abandoned coke oven.

How does piping 'wear out'?  I can understand about heating and cooling cycles, but you'd think those pipes would run at roughly the same temperature all the time once the reactor was up and running.  Is it the radioactivity?  Some kind of mechanical slurry mechanism that's grinding them away?  Inquiring minds want to know....

SCE have trouble marking their underground power lines correctly, but yet they are allowed to operate a Nuclear Plant. Shut these reactors down permanently. The potential loss of life could be in the millions should something happen. Their evacuation plan is a joke. Traffic is stopped even when it isn't rush hour, could you imagine if everyone was trying to leave at once? (I'd rather die at home verses on the freeway or roadway.) Property loss alone would devastate the economy that is already in the tank. Also, it can only withstand a 7.0 earthquake and yet the plant is located near fault lines. How many years have they been warning us of the big one? All of this for power to 1.4 million home when working at full capacity is simply not worth the risk. Citizens need to voice their concerns and stop this madness.

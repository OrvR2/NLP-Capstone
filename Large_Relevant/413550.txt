The real "WW1" was fought in America - it was the "French - Indian War". And it was essentially the Vatican's last attempt to dominate Britain and  control America. Thank G-d the French lost. Give me Britain any day.

The ultra orthodox (not orthodox) are parasites in Israel. They don't work. They're on welfare benefit. They aren't required to serve in the IDF like all other Israeiis. They have too many children. And then they have the nerve to lend aid to Iran and others who would destroy Israel. That is why the soldiers are moving them out of the way as they obstruct progress.

What is the Bible? It is a book on prophesy about G-d's perfect plan. Not one piece of it is coincidence: The exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt into Canaan - all foretold. The testimony of Moses, Jacob, David, Jesus and all the prophets. Not one word wrong. What is the mathematical probability it could be guesswork? Trillions upon trillions to one. Same with the Book of Revelations. Clearly it is talking about Roman Catholicism - a religion that nothing whatsoever to do with the gospel of Jesus.

"Gang Bangers" are an issue. There are people who work the system thru legal and illegal crimes. But their crimes pale in comparison with what the super rich get away with and their "corporate welfare" of the "Military Industrial Complex" and banking. Take the "Gang Bangers" and have them attack the ultra rich. They'll kill each other. Presto, kill two birds with one stone.

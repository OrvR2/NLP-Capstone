(Left to right): Hinna Zeejah, 8, Taejah Goode, 10, Julia Stokes, 11, and Grant Fritz, 8, who wrote to President …Invoking the painful memory of the schoolchildren killed in Newtown, Conn., a month ago, President Barack Obama on Wednesday announced the most ambitious gun-control drive in generations. Proposals include universal background checks as well as bans on assault weapons and ammunition clips that hold more than 10 bullets. Some of his proposals are sure to run headlong into fierce opposition from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress, as well as the powerful National Rifle Association lobby.
"I will put everything I’ve got into this,” Obama, standing alongside Vice President Joe Biden, promised an audience that included relatives of the first-graders slaughtered at Sandy Hook Elementary School, survivors of other mass shootings and elected officials.
"While there is no law, or set of laws, that can prevent every senseless act of violence completely, no piece of legislation that will prevent every tragedy, every act of evil, if there’s even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there’s even one life that can be saved, then we’ve got an obligation to try," Obama said in his speech. "And I’m going to do my part."
The president declared himself a firm believer in the Second Amendment and denounced those who will cast his "common-sense" approach as "a tyrannical, all-out assault on liberty." He also warned those inclined to support his strategy that passage "will be difficult."
“This will not happen unless the American people demand it. If parents and teachers, police officers and pastors, if hunters and sportsmen, if responsible gun owners, if Americans of every background stand up and say, ‘Enough, we’ve suffered too much pain and care too much about our children to allow this to continue,' then change will come," he said. "That’s what it’s going to take."

Bowing to political reality, Obama’s proposals include a wave of 23 executive actions that circumvent Congress, where most Republicans and a few Democrats have balked at sweeping new restrictions they say could trample constitutional gun rights. The potent NRA has also pledged to defeat new gun control measures.
The executive actions include requiring federal agencies to report more information to the federal background check system and directing the Centers for Disease Control to research gun violence. But Obama acknowledged that his more ambitious proposals would have to clear Congress.
Biden, in his introductory remarks, said, "I have no illusions about what we're up against." But "the world has changed, and it's demanding action."

Administration officials who previewed Obama's proposals on a conference call with reporters fleshed out some important details (on condition that they not be named)—and left some important questions unanswered:
- They wouldn’t say whether any of the steps the president is recommending would have prevented the massacre at Sandy Hook and other recent mass shootings. One senior official on the call did say, "There’s no question that both the actions that he’s taking and the legislation that he’s proposing will save lives.”
- They did not provide an estimate of how many lives would be saved annually if the president got everything he wanted, saying the social science on gun deaths is not precise enough to do so.
- Obama isn’t sending “specific legislative language” to Congress, the officials said, instead he's following his usual blueprint of laying out principles and then letting lawmakers craft a bill.
- The proposals to limit the manufacture of new assault weapons and ammunition clips with more than 10 bullets would not affect those already on the market.
- How did they settle on 10 bullets (and not seven, or 15)? One official said that number was taken from the 1994 assault weapons ban that Obama hopes to renew and strengthen.
- Was the so-called "Fast and Furious" gun trafficking scandal a factor in shaping the president's proposals? "It was not," said one official.
President Barack Obama, accompanied by Vice President Joe Biden, talks about proposals to reduce gun violence, …
House Republicans gave the proposals a supremely cautious welcome. A spokesman for Republican House Speaker John Boehner, Michael Steel, said, "House committees of jurisdiction will review these recommendations. And if the Senate passes a bill, we will also take a look at that."
After the president's speech, Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, often cited as a possible presidential contender in 2016, vowed to oppose the proposals.
“Nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at Sandy Hook. President Obama is targeting the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens instead of seriously addressing the real underlying causes of such violence,” Rubio charged in a statement.
And the NRA blasted Obama's approach, saying: "Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation."
The organization also noted that "only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy."
Sounding almost as cautious as Boehner, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared himself “committed to ensuring that the Senate will consider legislation that addresses gun violence and other aspects of violence in our society early this year.” That stopped well short of embracing the president’s actual recommendations.
But Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence President Dan Gross praised the White House’s “tremendous leadership” and vowed to “work with the administration over the coming months” to promote key proposals.
And retired congresswoman and mass shooting survivor Gabrielle Giffords plans to lobby her former colleagues, while national public opinion polls have shown a surge in popular support for new gun laws.
The president has long said he seeks a comprehensive strategy for preventing future mass shootings while diminishing the death toll from smaller-scale daily killings. Some of what he unveiled would require congressional action, like the assault weapons ban. Some could be achieved with merely a presidential signature—a step that could, in some cases, inflame opposition in Congress, notably among House Republicans.
(Some of those are decidedly small-scale, however: One of the 23 "executive actions" trumpeted by the White House was that Obama will "clarify" that Obamacare "does not prohibit doctors asking their patients about guns in their homes.")
Obama scolded the Senate for failing to confirm a director for the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives in six years and said he would nominate the agency's acting director, Todd Jones, to the post.
The proposals were the fruit of extensive discussions, led by Biden, with victims' groups, organizations that represent gun owners, elected officials and law-enforcement leaders.
Obama also wants to boost anti-bullying campaigns in schools, and training for educators. Additionally he wants to give schools the ability to use some federal funds to improve safety—but did not explicitly echo the NRA’s demand for armed guards in schools.
Key steps also included imposing background checks on all gun purchases. Right now, an estimated 40 percent fall outside existing law, including those at gun shows and other "private" sales, according to gun-control advocates. The existing system has stopped an estimated 1.5 million improper gun sales, according to an Obama aide, but "there's still too many loopholes." The president directed Attorney General Eric Holder to take a "fresh look" into whether the categories of people prohibited from buying firearms needs to be expanded or updated.
Obama also aimed to thaw what the White House called a "freeze" in scientific research of gun violence by the Centers for Disease Control. And he urged Congress to bankroll the CDC to do research into possible linkages between violent video games and other media images and real-life violence, to the tune of $10 million.
“We don’t benefit from ignorance," Obama said. "We don’t benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence.”
The total cost of the president's proposals was estimated at $500 million.

Once the unthinkable has been done it cannot be undone. Its like "breaking trumps" in bridge. The idea ( and the media coverage) is out there and it is pervasive. Every use of gun/gun violence becomes connected to Newtown.

Oh yeah, rolling out the same gun control measures that are in place in Chicago will do so much to control gun violence across the nation just like it does in Chicago...btw, gun deaths in Chicago are at 42 as of last night.
Disarming the law abiding makes them targets and victims.

Gee, I'll bet you don't believe in global warming, although it can cause an ice age, so I guess your time is coming soon. Noticebly absent was your piece by piece debate of my conclusions, so they will stand. I know just as many conservatives as liberals that smoke pot so that argument fizzled too. Tienamen Square was how long ago, exactly? That was in China, if memory serves, and not here.  Liberals are still standing between conservatives and the power and as long as they can do it, we won't have another Bush looting the treasury, we won't have the middleclass successfully attacked, and we won't see an end to organized labor, whose high paying jobs give people the purchasing power to drive the economy in the frst place. Everything you said was passe. Times have changed. or maybe, liberals were the patriots, the whole time, and it's just now becoming more obvious.It was a liberal movement that put an end to the Viet Nam War, the great meat grinder of American Youth, there for reasons no one ever really knew, yet 67,000 had to die to line the pockets of defense contractors. It was a liberal movement that flushed the arch criminal Nixon from office, after he displayed such contempt for our laws. It was a liberal movement that demanded investigation of Reagan's criminal enterprise of selling arms for hostages, and interfering in the Nicaraguan Civil War, though prohibited from doing so by law-the Boland Amendments.
Republicans aren't patriots at all, as that is just camo. They are little better than an  organized crime syndicate, waiting for their next opportunity. They tried awfully hard to buy the White House, this last election. Too bad they wasted so much money, a poor return on investment. Turns out the White House is not for sale at all, as it is just a rental property.
Next time you see an American Flag, think about that. Think about the fact that there has been a dramatic increase of domestic attacks by people who are strictly allied with the extreme right wing of American Politics, the same ones who have up till now, been claiming the mantle of patriotism. You can't salute the flag, wear it on a pin, and also fire on it at the same time.

What do the shootings of Gabby Giffords in Arizona, at Sandy Hook, and Aurora Colorado have in common?  

In each case, the killer was a highly intelligent young man, with KNOWN mental health issues.  In each case there was known reason to have these men committed.  Holmes out in Colorado had been under the care of a professor who had reported him to campus police for his violent fantasies, Loughner in AZ. had multiple restraining orders due to his insanity, and Lanza was known to have issues his entire life.  

This just goes to show that it is not necessary to take away the rights of law abiding folks, in order to stop these types of shootings.  These men were obviously mentally ill, and had no business being on the streets at the time.  Had there been proper action, these tragedies would have been averted. Yes, Sandy Hook would have never happened, had Adam Lanza’s mother been allowed to have her son institutionalized, as she was attempting.  

It’s not about the guns or the number of bullets, it is about the poor state of our mental healthcare system, that lets these people loose on the streets.  Until this is addressed, the violence WILL continue, regardless of how many rights are taken from the public.

A check of Pistol License records shows that Senator Schumer possesses an "unrestricted" pistol permit, a rarity in New York City. Licenses are distributed in different categories in the Big Apple: Target Permits allow only use of a firearm at a licensed firing range; Premises Permits allow weapons to be kept in a home or apartment; Restricted Permits allow the gunowner to carry their firearms concealed but only within the purview of their job (security, jewelers, armored car guards, etc.). So it's evident that just like Obama, Senator Schumer has two sets of rules -- one for Americans and one for himself.

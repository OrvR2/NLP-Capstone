2012 April - Kim Jong-un formally takes over ruling party leadership, becoming First Secretary of the Workers Party.
The launch of a "rocket-mounted satellite" to mark the birthday of Kim Il-Sung fails.

2012 December - A North Korean rocket launch puts a satellite into orbit, after the failure to do so in April. The UN including China regard this as a violation of a ban on North Korean ballistic missile tests, as the rocket technology is the same.
2013 January - The UN Security Council condemns the December launch. North Korea announces it will carry out a third "high-level nuclear test" and rehearse more long-range rocket launches aimed at the US "arch-enemy". The statement gave no time-frame. North Korea conducted two nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009.

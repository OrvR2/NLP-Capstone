I know it's still early in the investigation but should the FAA think about outlawing lithium-ion batteries if we know about their problematic history? What was the matter with﻿ hydraulics?

Lithium Ion batteries with thermal runaway conditions is not a new phenomenon- what has yet to take place, and its been an on going battle since it's very elusive, the proper determination﻿ when that battery has reached full charge, and the associated circuits cuts the charging to zero.
there is a diode, along with a capacitor that keeps these from bleeding current off and producing a thermal runaway condition, however, if these are shorted (shorts can come in various forms), then it fails.

HP had recalls in 2009-2011: .cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtm­l11/11234.html
"HP has received 40 additional reports of batteries that overheated and ruptured, resulting in seven burn injuries, one smoke inhalation injury, and 36 instances of property damage."
But of course, MOST of time, the companies just blame it on "China", or user errors.
But was it really? Now I guess we﻿ will never know. That that sure didn't make the problem go away.

These lithium cobalt oxide type batteries are considered the most flammable of all lithium ion batteries. This type of failure and fire hazard has been happening ever since Sony first introduced the battery technology in commercial use in 1991. That's﻿ more than 20 years ago.
It's a very OLD problem that has never been resolved properly. There have been major recalls issued for this type of batteries for laptops and mobile phones, for almost every year in recent years.

The batteries were made by GS Yuasa in Japan. They also makes batteries for NASA and the International Space Center.
The battery charging unit (BCU) is made by Securaplane in Arizona, which had a fire in 2006 that burnt down their building, when they were testing the BCU and the batteries.
The electronic system was contracted to Thales﻿ in France, which has been making electronics for many planes, from back in Boeing 737 days.

Batteries made﻿ in Japan. Big problems.
So Japan should stop killing whales and upsetting Australians.

The electrical system was outsourced to Thales in France. Thales then sub contracted a Japanese company to do the﻿ batteries.

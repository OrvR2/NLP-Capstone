do you realize how ignorant you sound? if you honestly think that banning guns will somehow stop criminals from getting them or wanting them, then you need a﻿ serious wake up call. maybe a knife but nothing more?! i cant begin to express how WRONG you are. im sorry but get a clue

Mr. Obama, the II amendment to the US Constitution is meant to protect the people from dunces like you. No, it's not meant to protect the rights of target/competition shooters and deer hunters. I will not vote for any state and federal representatives who support any legislation that further jeopardizes the 2nd amendment. By the way, your form stinks based on that picture your﻿ groupies published.

The only reason Obama is big on Gun Control? Because he﻿ believes that Big Govt is the answer to Social Utopia. He can't control the US population if the are armed and willing to defend our rights. Right after he removes our guns, what's next our Property?

B.S. using a tragedy to further laws which will not curb violence. The truly violent insane will plan and get﻿ guns regardless, we honest citizens have the right to buy any weapon which will protect our gun rights under the constitution. Don't let the govt. use any excuse to disarm lawful citizens.

He really just said that he supports and respects legal and responsible gun owners and then basically says, "But I don't trust you that much, so I'm asking congress to take your rifles and MAGAZINES (not clips) away."
He has no respect what-so-ever for the legal gun owners of this country.
He's crazy! Insane! A future dictator! A tyrant!
HOW IN FUCKS NAME COULD YOU HAVE VOTED FOR THIS SCUM BAG!!!
For the love of peat, I'll never understand how so﻿ many Americans got so fucking stupid. #F-U-ALL

Chicago:
-One of the worst states in the union for public education
-One of the most﻿ violent cities in America (and the world), yet one of the most restrictive states in the Union on gun control.
-One of the most bankrupt states in the union, unable to fulfill its debt obligations.
-One of the most politically corrupt in the union with half of Illinois governors in prison since 1970
-One of the most left leaning in the US
Common sense?
Stop the problem by voting out politicians from Illinois.

It makes me sick when the only arguments people present when asked about gun rights is that it it protected in the constitution. Whether or not the gun rights should be restricted or not, the decision should involve critical thinking of the issues involved. The constitution is some holy book of﻿ truth that should be seen as perfect and unalterable. If you don't think the gun laws should be changed, that's fine, but you have to provide real reasons why not. You can't just say that its a rule.

I completely agree with gun control. It works, if it is enforced correctly. It's sad that most american's﻿ look at gun control and think of "gun ban" The ban of guns and the control and regulation of guns are two completely different things. But of course all of you NRA fan's won't do any real research, and just start yelling at me in the comment, but if you do may i ask you this one question. If you are going to use guns safely wouldn't a handgun be sufficient?

Why petition Obama, that makes no sense. This is not a federal case. You﻿ guys are treating Obama like his was a Saudi Sheik. They have a similar petition of the King called majlis. By custom, all males of full age have a right to petition the king directly through the traditional tribal meeting known as the majlis. How is this any different﻿ than that. Obama is not the Fürer why are you treating him as such. What is wrong with you people?

Shame on this Admin & some of our legislators for standing on the graves of those children to further an agenda. Americans have owned AR type rifles for better than 40 years, this mass shooting craze is just the last 10 years or so. The problem has nothing to﻿ do with the tool used. Want make progress, look at the user, not the tool used. Mental Health, a movie & game industry that glorifies violence, & media that always makes the killer infamous to boost ratings, all affect behavior, look there.

I believe there should be federal investigations into anyone who owns multiple guns!!!! Why? What is their purpose? Are they all properly registered? Check owners for any previous mental conditions?? Create a database for any prescription medications they might be on that were because of mental, or behavior issues?? Many, many people own﻿ guns that definately should not own them!!!!! In the name of public safety, our government needs to know who they are!!!!!

Us gun owners are not the problem. Those who own multiple guns are not the problem. Guns should not and don't have to be registered, it's a waste of time and lot's of money to create a database that compiles serial numbers that can be filed/ground off by a criminal, see Canada, California, NY, etc. for examples. Your beliefs﻿ are unsupported, you do not use facts or logic, and it's obvious just from reading your comments you are unintelligent.

All the mass shootings that happened last year was caused by legally registered guns!!!!! If those guns were in a "FEDERAL" database, the guns could have been traced to whom they belonged to, and verified the owners were mentally sound, and not﻿ any drugs for nervous conditions, depression, sleep disorders, or anything else which could possibly make them unstable!!!!! There should be yearly federal registrations for all guns, so they can be traced, and used for what activities!!!!

Those guns are not in a database per say, but they could be traced. They were illegally obtained however, through﻿ theft and murder of his mother. The other incident was completely a mental health issue and should have been dealt with at the time of purchase, not through registration.

Presdient Obama: Please do NOT be disheartened by﻿ the negative comments, or the thumbed down comments! I know for a fact, that Fox News has been sending their viewers here to "voice your displeasure"! Surveys have shown that most Americans agree with President Obama, that there needs to be a ban on assault weapons, and smaller gun magazines, strict gun regulations, background checks on ammunition, as well as guns!!!!! And make it a felony to buy, or sell a gun without federal registration!!!!

This is virtually already in effect, and deaths in these areas from gun violence (Which is actually a mental issue, not a gun control issue) is MUCH higher than in areas where guns are not prohibited. This is because these shootings are quickly stopped by﻿ armed law-abiding citizens, whereas in prohibited areas, the police arrive after many are already dead.

What you are saying about armed citizens stopping shootings is complete and utter BS! In fact, concealed carry holders actually do more harm than good! They, more times than not, actually increase the injury and death to innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire!!!! Arming citizens sounds nice, but the reality of it, what is essentually happening is people taking the law into their own hands, when law enforcement would do a much better job!!!!!﻿ We dont live in the old West any more!!!!

I would be interested﻿ in seeing a source that shows how concealed carry holders do more harm than good? They, in fact, more times than not, stop crime. The police are not obligated to protect you, so they would not do a better job. Police are code enforcers, not citizen protectors. I encourage you to look up the facts and get them from neutral sources other than CNN, MSNBC, or the other biased anti-gun groups. More guns=less crime, it's proven and backed up with facts. Gun control is not.

I bring up validated facts, and you claim it comes from this 'Faux Newz'. That's﻿ a laugh.
You want to disarm the people, through the government- The very thing we need arms in order to resist, in order to stop an authoritarian takover, along with fighting both foreign and domestic enemies who would seek to do harm, outlaws and mental patients who would not turn in their guns, but instead take advantage when loyal citizens are disarmed, to wreak havoc for the police, those of brutality, step in.

You're﻿ kidding, right? Please tell me you're just trolling. Considering that all mass shootings take place in gun free zones (even the Aura shooter had a choice of seven theaters in a 20 mile radius, including like two that were closer to his apartment, and choose the only one that was a gun free zone) you're either trolling, incredibly stupid, or hoping for more deaths for some sick and twisted reason.

Perpetrators of a crime will be more likely spotted in a gun free zone, because it would be unlawful to even have a gun on the premises! So, if someone in a gun free zone is spotted with a gun, it will be easier for law enforcement to assume they arent ther to hunt turkeys! How can the law not miss seeing someone﻿ with a assault rifle in a gun free zone?? Banning assault rifles is a great place to start! Also monitoring gun owners, find out what medications they are on, and why!!

If you want to own guns, you should be required to show the feds what you own, why you own them, where they﻿ are located, and if you are qualified to own them!!!! I believe ALL guns should be required to be licensed, or registered on a yearly basis, just like your vehicles!!!! A ownership fee should be included to purchase the registration!!!! The government will only give you the priveledge to own a gun if they have a record of your medications, so they can track your ongoing mental status!!

sir i urge you to really look into the history books....what you are proposing has been done many times in the past and has ALWAYS ended up being a bad idea...that is the problem i see most in the gun debate....everyone thinks the logical answer to stop gun crime is to ban guns....history has shown time and time again that gun registration and gun bans are very dangerous ideas that have always﻿ had bad consequences...and in response to your last sentence...owning a gun is a RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE!

The short answer, nobody ever shot anyone without a gun!!!! BTW, owning a gun is a privilege which is granted by the federal government!!!! Just like driving is a privilege! It it is deemed unsafe for people to own guns, then those in higher authority, who have studied all sides of the issure,﻿ can, and will make the final decisions on who can own a weapon, and who should not!!!! All of the mass shooting that happened last year, was by legally purchased guns!!! Maybe these laws need changing!

Where in the constitution and bill of rights does it say "the right of the people to drive shall not be infringed"????? It does however say "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed!" and is last i checked this Connecticut fuck up killed his mom and stole her guns...was that legally purchased???? Someone watches too much Biased Piers Morgan and nbc... ﻿

I ask you this, if you were in a room with your family, and all that was in there was a gun, a cell phone, and a note that read "FACT: Someone is going to come into this room and kill you and your family. But before he kills them he will rape them, then cut their throats until the most gut wrenching gurgling sounds and then kill you." what would﻿ you honestly do???

First of all, that gun should not be in the room! Secondly, haw can this heinous crime take place if he is banned from owning a gun??﻿ This would not be a crime with no gun!!!! I would have the same equal chance as he!!!! Owning a gun is a privilege, not a right!!!!! The 2nd amendment was created when assault weapons were muskets!!!! Time have changed, so laws need to change with it!!!!

Answer my question please. secondly, i am not yelling so i expect the same common courtesy that i am giving﻿ you. So basically you are saying that you would sit back and chance your family being raped and killed? Also which heinous crime are you referring to? Why does it say in our bill of RIGHTS that "The RIGHT of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed"? And you would have the same equal chance a a man with any other type of weapon if you only had a cell phone?

There were people discovering electricty and making light bulbs when the constitution was being passed, they new technology would catch up with them. if times have changed then is the 1st amendment in need of change? it must be out dated to right? And yes The 2nd amendment was created so WE THE PEOPLE can be in control of our gov't istead of the other way﻿ around. it was made so we can have equal arms as the military at the time and still today.

I wasn't even going﻿ to reply to your nonsense but there is one issue i really need to address...first of all i have the god given RIGHT to protect myself, my family, and my property....second....have you ever heard of the Bill of RIGHTS.....you know the first ten amendments in our constitution....called the Bill of RIGHTS....have a look at number 2 on that list.....now if these amendments weren't to be considered rights do you not think they would have called it something else...

there are 300 million people in the country.there have been
six school shootings in the last 10 years,i'm including aurora.
300 million﻿ divided by six is 50 million .one in 50 million or
0.0000002% of the the population will commit such a heinous act
over a 10 year period.you can expect in your state or your 4 surrounding
states that one school shooting will happen in the next ten years.you want
to trash the 2nd amendment for that?we need armed teachers as utah
has done for 12 yrs.no shootings

You're trying to take﻿ away the rights of those children at the same time. It will be their right to own guns and freely exercise their natural rights of self defense. You and I won't be here forever, and it's up to us to show our children how to survive and prosper in an ugly and dangerous world, not to cower in fear over what "might" happen because you're too frightened and want to run to the government for protection.

I love that gun advocates, in order to "avoid fascism", suggest that armed guards be placed in schools around the country. So your plan to avoid fascism, in which there would﻿ be armed guards everywhere, is to PUT ARMED GUARDS EVERYWHERE. Wow, you really dodged a bullet there.
These same people usually love talking about mental health, too. Oh sorry, did you suggest we need BETTER health care? Care that should be universally accessible...oh yeah, like OBAMA tried to negotiate? Fucking idiots.

Very possible. If you need proof, check out the "Sandy Hook Exposed" video.﻿ There's no way such a huge load of offensive bullshit could get more likes than dislikes, but if you check out the comments, its clear there are bots involved. REALLY, gun advocates, you need bots to make it look like you hold the popular opinion? Fucking crazy.

no they dont? so someone armed with a hand gun can not fight off someone trying to rape them? lets be honest and not jump off the deep end here. ok lets look at the UK then shall we. since the 1970's the UK has had firm laws on guns, however their murder rates have risen every year despite that. in 1970 their over all murder rate was .71 per 100,000 and it peaked at 2.1 in 2001. so lets see gun control﻿ has done what here? it simply reduced the number of GUN deaths but murders climbed & climbed

since australia was brought up i would like to add a little statistic for you. thier homicide numbers are around 170 to 300 persons per year (my estimates off of the countries own reports). in 1980﻿ they had 279 homicides of which 103 were with firearms. in 2004 there were 293 homicides with only 32 with firearms. and that trend continued fairly consistently each year. so again i ask; what did gun control really do here? about the same numbers with and without gun control

actually if you look it up the statistics have not changed much since the shooting ( a few % not the "huge swing" purposed), however historically this﻿ subject is loosing many supporters for the gun ban since 92. if you look up an article titled "How Newtown changed Americans’ views on guns (and how it didn’t)" you will see in 92 78% of people we for heavier gun control where as now it is at 58%..... i mean taking stats from JUST after a tragedy is not a good way of getting REAL numbers.

There was a mass shooting in Australia in the 80's or 90's, can't remember the exact year.
30 people were killed, and the government immediately started enforcing assault weapons regulations. Their mass shooting rates have drastically dropped ever since.
Gun regulation doesn't work, people. Because fuck real world examples.
The only time the killing stops is when they﻿ have to reload. Civilian's don't need 30 - 100 round magazine's for hunting or protecting their house.

dont know what that has to do with what i said but ok lets look at some stats.
in 95 Australia's rape rate per 100,000 was 72.5 and in 03 it was 91.7
the us for the same timer period saw different numbers 95 37.1 to 32.1. i can site MANY more numbers if you would like to keep going. should i bbring the UK into this? their numbers are even worse.
so a society that has no﻿ guns PROVES it is more dangerous, sure the murder rate with guns is less but does not change over all murder rate on average.

Guns have no connection﻿ with rape. What the fuck are you talking about?
When there's a man with a 50 round magazine going on a rampage, he's going to kill a LOT of people. When a man has a 7-9 round magazine, he's only going to kill a few.
But no, we might as well give people guns with enough bullets to kill 500 people without having to reload. Makes perfect fucking sense.

It's sickening how he put﻿ "common sense legislation" and "banning assault weapons" together in the same sentence. Banning something that's involved in about 0.2% of gun crimes is suuuurely going to help, right?
Fuck you, Barry. I used to like you but now you've gone bananas.

Plus I'm actually liberal on several issues and would have voted for him if I were american, but this AWB is utterly useless and dumb. Plus, as a lawful gun owner, I find your "crazy fucking gun﻿ nut" definition ignorant, immature, and disrespectful. Regards.

If you can't comprehend what Obama is saying you shouldn't own a gun in the first place. Are IQ test's given before you can own a gun? If not why not?

Guns are banned in the UK so knife crimes are off the charts, And no u dont need any test u just show ur ID and buy ur gun. The UK has 3.5 times the violent crime rate as the US so who needs an IQ test?
In places where there are more guns theres less crime, guns keep﻿ people safe. If u think ur safer without a gun in the home ur dumb

I fully understand what he's saying, and reject it. Additionally I had testing administered by a psychologist when I was in high school (age 17), using WAIS-III (WAIS-IV had just come out when I took mine). My FSIQ is 147 (sd15). I think that makes me one of the most intelligent people in the country. Oh and get this, I have zero interest in going to college. Isn't that a﻿ bitch? I could probably help to cure cancer if I actually cared to do so.

Haha get off your high horse, holy shit. I have a higher IQ than you and it hasn't helped me get top grades in university, let alone cure cancer. You should really look up the concept of bell curves. A 147 probably puts you in the top﻿ 1%, which means in a country of 330 million people, over 3.3 million are more intelligent than yourself. Your IQ also advances with your education, meaning the average IQ of a university student is actually 140. So yeah, I guess a 147 makes you REALLY special!!!!

0.09% actually.
So assuming a population of 330 million that means there are only 297,000 individuals with a higher intelligence.
I don't believe you have an IQ higher than mine, or likely anywhere near mine. In fact I doubt you've ever had testing at all.
Not only are many of the things you've stated laughable, but the numbers you are throwing around are absolutely meaningless in their current format. I'm not telling you what you're missing either. You claim to be a Genius, you figure it﻿ out.

also a side note given the stats you claim; you are part of a 2.5% of the population ( using your SD of 15). let me﻿ explain; 95% of the population sits in the first 2 SD's from 100, 70-130. you are at 145 which makes you part of the 3rd SD. which means you are one of 5% of the population outside the fist 2 SD's. remove the lower half (below 100) which makes you one of 8.2 million people in the US. which makes you one in 8 milling, you go girl!

sorry sorry last one. just go home saw that your score is actually 147 not the 145 i thought (maybe i should not make responses on my phone). that makes you one of the top .18% of the population, aka one of about 550,000 in the US with at least that score. but given that the number from taking the test can change from each taking and that IQ can drop with age, statistically speaking, my first estimates might be fairly accurate. ﻿

Gates does not have an IQ of 220. Nothing close to it.
198 is the HIGHEST EVER RECORDED. All﻿ these 200+ numbers are based on MSR tests (used for children), not Standard Deviation tests (used for adults). Sidis was 197, and it was beat out by someone else in 2012 (198). Of course anything over 180 is hard to quantify due to low sampling rate of testers in that range.

you do know that until 180 you are simply considered intelligent, and﻿ 180+ is genius, 200 is prodigy. dead average is 100 but realistically its like 90-120. and as someone who also had test done by the state as a kid i ranked at a 183. but thanks to dyslexia and having sever ADD, it really hindered school. just thought i would weigh in on the matter hours later :)

Your information is incorrect.
Mine wasn't done by the state. It also wasn't a children's test. I'm at Genius level.
Do you even KNOW the name of the test you﻿ took? The standard deviation? I don't know what you took (if you actually took anything), but whatever it was I can guarantee you it wasn't timed/standardized. There are only about 80 people in the entire country who have an IQ of 180 or above. You don't even know how to use capital letters or spell correctly, so you aren't one of them.

actually it is not and i took mine at age 16, aka the age at which IQ is considered to be at its peak. having looked up the facts after your post i am mistaken, true average is 90-130 my mistake. i do wonder﻿ about iq though. i mean someone as smart as 145 should be aware of what dyslexia is and know that it leads to a difficulty in reading and writing. and has no impact on a true iq. as for what test it was i can not tell you, the results are at my parent's house and i took it about 20 yrs ago.

Average is 85-114 (or there about). In the US the actual average is 98, though I don't know what the standard deviation is.
I know what dyslexia is, and I don't think you have it, I simply believe you're lazy and lack simple writing ability. You can give me whatever sob story you wish, but frankly I don't﻿ care.
As for the ADD issue, if you were actually diagnosed you should know that there is no such thing as ADD, it's actually either ADHD or ADHD-I (as per DSM-IV-TR).

I'm kind of upset because I was planning on buying guns when I move out of my parents's house (because guns are rad﻿ as hell and I wanna collect them)
My personal belief is that we should try to increase the quality of life and mental healthcare in the US so we can help mentally unstable people, instead of ignoring them until they commit a crime. Making something illegal doesn't make it go away, so banning guns won't do anything. What we need to do is help the people, not ban the tools.

 buddy i own 3 rifles and 2 handguns i﻿ cant stand this president he's trying to disarm the american people, he doesn't want to put armed security guards in our schools but yet has security guards for his kids at school, He is infringing the 2nd amendment all these laws he wants that are unconstitutional. He is acting like a king or a dictator he is trying to control the american people.

Just a question, why do you need 3 rifles and 2 handguns? what is the need for them to be owned? Also, the 2nd amendment was created hundreds of years ago, when the USA was in its first days and the threat of war at home was real, so there was a reason for civilians to own their own guns. The United States is one of the best protected countries in the world, and people don't need to defend themselves. He is not acting like a dictator. He is acting like a leader trying﻿ to protect his people.

"The United States is one of the best protected countries in the world, and people don't need to defend themselves". Are you kidding me? Cops take hours to arrive in some states, and even then they're not legally﻿ obliged to protect you (supreme court said so). Please, learn how things actually work in a country before you start spewing "facts" about it.

so you're saying you own 3 rifles and 2 hand guns, because the cops won't protect you? You don't need that﻿ many guns, 1 pistol would be ample in defending your house in the event an intruder comes into your house, which by the way probably won't happen. I was speaking about best protected as in the US military can defend the country from other countries, so the original reason for the second amendment to defend from the british is mute now. and what states does it take hours for the cops to come

actually﻿ the idea was for the people to rise up against a tyrannical government. the idea being that if the people are armed similarly to said government's army, it would be difficult for the government to enforce things against the people. now b4 everyone goes crazy about your average person having access to rocket launchers and parking b1 bombers in their back yard that is not what i am saying. simply explaining the amendment as it is written.

thats a valid point. But the US government isn't going to begin mass genocide or anything unthinkable, this is﻿ the 21st century. the US has a stable democracy and there is no reason for the US citizens to rise up against its government, Im not saying take away all guns, im just saying assault rifles and the like are not necessary to defend ones home, a pistol with a handful of bullets would be ample.

and the response to that is that assault rifles HAVE been removed from the public... an assault rifle is defined as a fully automatic weapon with an interchangeable magazine. examples of that are the true AK-47 and a military M16. the﻿ AR-15 doe not fit that description. the fire power in a high caliber handgun can do more damage then the AR. look at the damage done in the VT shooting, all he used was hand guns and was able to do much more damage than any of the last shootings.

People don't need to defend themselves wtf is wrong with you do you think the police will get to your house in a blink of an eye when you call 911 when you have a home invasion you will be dead by the time they get there. Law enforcement also says that we should be armed to protect ourselves because they are responders they respond to crime. And they also know gun control DOES NOT WORK! and they are also standing up to fight obama to what he's﻿ doing to our 2nd amendment rights.

I wish I had an "assault rifle" (not to be confused with their semi-automatic counterparts) to defend myself from﻿ multiple home invaders, unfortunately since 1938 I believe, those guns have been heavily regulated. Facts don't lie, do your own research, don't let your government or the media do it for you.

My other purpose would be to put holes in targets, but I must be crazy to﻿ want to do that, huh? I am glad I don't live near you in Chicago, the shitty city. The most anti-gun city with the worst crime. And the problem began with prohibition and the mob in the 30's. Now the problem is with the legislators and the gangs. When you take the guns from the good, evil has power.

An assault rifle is a selective fire (selective between fully automatic, semi-automatic, and burst﻿ fire) rifle that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine.
even if they aren't assault rifles, please explain to me why you need 5 of them?

The reasons most have more than one gun:
1) Collecting guns-they are cool and fun to shoot/look at.
2) Different guns are for different situations such﻿ as home defense, self defense, target shooting, competition shooting, disaster situations, etc. You truly cannot have enough guns, one person's beliefs on what is enough may not coincide with what another believes is enough.
Us gun owners are being demonized due to ignorance, we do not cause crime, we don't want to be victims. Respect our rights

You cannot seperate you're own hatred of historical wrong-doings with what is happening today.You think the only people who have ever suffered are members of you're own race which explains why you felt compelled to have an easy dig at the 'big bad white man'
Don't attempt to be a victim for your﻿ forefathers instead show a little respect for the wrongs they suffered! show some dignity & remember that white people have also suffered terrible injustices through-out history.

I will explain to you why. Initiative. Take the initiative to better your life and your life will be better, people are unemployed because they did not take the initiative. Get a higher education, get good grades, go to a vocational school, start a business, begin a career that will allow﻿ you to progress. The unemployment lines are not all blacks, you are being racist again. My father is unemployed and he is white. Those laws are being enforced actually and court cases prove that.

Did you know that George Washington emancipated his slaves in his will and his estate paid pensions to the older African Americans for decades? Not to mention that Benjamin Franklin sent to Congress a petition asking for the abolition of slavery and an end to the slave trade. And let's not forget James Madison, who believed that slavery was bad for both the slave and the slave-holder.
Doesn't sound racist to me. Sound's more like you're afraid of being﻿ shot because you don't own a gun.

i dont think that he will confiscate ur weapons. just banning the sale of future weapons. but you will need to register your guns and if it is an assault rifle you can never sell it or give it to anybody.
-just stating what ive heard.﻿ i dont agree with him. what we need are stricter laws to obtain one. like fbi background checks and other pre-req. also WE NEED HARSHER PENALTIES FOR PEOPLE WHO OWN GUNS ILLEGALLY. NO MORE SLAPS ON THE WRISTS

I ..might agree with you to some extent..but certinally not on FBI I remember when the FBI did a background check on me The Army requested it in Aug of 1967 because I had enlisted for , for, infantry school and Jump School( mandatory..if you are enlisting for USASF In a real rush it took the FBI 6 months..Now there is a whole new agency that handles -background checks. just﻿ for the military...some times they take over two years to complete one...often the person is given a pass to continue

i enlisted in the airforce last year and there was a private investigator who did a background check. id be perfectly ok with that having to happen to buy semi automatic weapons. i am not in the military now however due to the shit judical system we have because they let someone with numerous﻿ felonies out on bail wile he was awaiting trial. i had an encounter with him and an illegal firearm was used in the assault. i sustained life threatening injury's and cannot enlist again

dear gun nut IDIOTS, learn some history.
"In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an executive order & signed the Gun Control Act of 1968.
President George H.W. Bush used his executive authority under the 1968 law to permanently ban the import of﻿ 43 specific firearms.
Article II of the U.S. Constitution grants any president the authority﻿ and the discretion to issue executive orders over the sale of guns and ammunition. "- since you cant "trust mainstream media" this came from FOX NEWS.

Have you﻿ guys read some of the comments? Lots of crazy gun owners trying to assert their right to own semi automatic rifles on this page! The facts are hunting rifles will not be on the weapon ban list but AR-15 and AK-47s are illegal. Thanks Mr President! I hope this country moves forward and we end the insanity of gun massacres within our country.

Semiautomatic is the ONLY commonality between the 2 types of weapons, JMERS. No pistol performs at the level of an AK47S, for instance, which will turn a concrete block to dust with 1 shot. There isn't ANY pistol that powerful!!! And you can﻿ buy clips that hold anywhere from 15 to 60 rounds. No goddamn pistol in the world comes close and you should stop bullying everyone who posts a comment which doesn't align with your uninformed opinion (that you present as if it were a fact).

The debate has fairly brought to light the issue.Any weapon that uses continuous bullets from a magazine of 30-40,is an assault.Background﻿ checks and checks on resale are important component to the law.The ownership and carrying of weapon should be uniform in all states without prejudice.Thanks Obama! you are doing fine.Kjs

No it should be a state by state issue, not uniform in all states. The federal government needs to keep their hands out of this. If New York wants to go extreme on their laws but Florida or whatever state doesn't that should﻿ be their choice.

The purpose of Federal law is to protect the basic rights.If I want to carry﻿ my pistol,or hunt in Wisconsin,I shouldn't have to have a separate permission.If I want to carry my rifle(just the basic) Why I need to seek permission at every city,county,state etc.India used to have check points for truckers at every state,They wisely introduced National permits,every state honored the system.What is happening to US.

No pistol holds a 100 round clip...or even 30, which is more typical. Plus even if the caliber was similar between a handgun & assault rifle, the rifle will shoot 3-4x higher grain & carry 5x greater kinetic energy. Compare a .223 rifle shell & .38 caliber pistol shell...The .38 is a fatter slug but the .223 does 5x more damage bc it's triple the grain n has 2.5x FPS bc of﻿ the long barrel. And .223 is assault rifle ammo. A clip holds 30. Don't compare pistols to rifles, you look stupid.

His true agenda is obviously to take away everyone's guns so that he can order﻿ the military to impose martial law on the entire United States and then hold constitution-burning Jesus-mocking orgies where attendance is mandatory. This agenda makes much more sense than trying to prevent gun-related crimes.
By the way, I'm curious: how do you know any more than the President what the "majority" of American people are saying about this issue?

Why are you telling me this? It IS possible to deplore someone's ideas without calling for censorship / punishment. Free speech is something protected by the 1st amendment.
...but apparently, there are 109,334+ other people who don't understand this. (Reference to the petition to deport Piers Morgan). It's kind of ironic that a hundred thousand pro-gun people (you know…the defenders of our freedoms or something?) who worry so much about the 2nd amendment can﻿ so easily gloss over the 1st.

Free speech is protected by the first﻿ ammendment as you said which is why I responded at all. You went after that guy because he made a "racist" comment. Racism is seen as huge social crime this day in time and anyone who participates is noted as ignorant or uneducated. People who make so called "racist" comments are immediately labeled and chastised. Now that is censorship. I wasn't advocating that you should not speak your mind. I was supporting the voice of someone who is commonly censored.

President Obama, Sir. I am a US Army Infantryman from Texas, and am REALLY jumping my Chain of Command, but I MUST say, sir, with all due respect, if you do not know what you are talking about ("banning the sale of military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips?"), please find someone who does (like me, who used to be a gunsmith prior to joining the﻿ Infantry) to help you better understand what exactly it is you are trying to legislate. I would be more than happy to help you.

I do not know why citizens want to possess guns in the US. This clearly shows that police presence or ambiance is poor. If police presence and vigilance is﻿ apparent, I do not think citizens need to possess guns. If citizens want guns, it clearly shows there is poor governance regarding domestic defense. What is the use of international defense or waging wars outside the US, while it is so unsafe for citizens within the US? This is unfortunate and something serious is missing in local governance.

 Our government is overbearing and out of control. We have to be able﻿ to protect ourselves from it. Do you really trust your government to protect you from criminals and from its own agenda? When in history has a government been able to be trusted to fulfill the needs of its people. Humans have come from a history of monarchies and dictatorships to a more democratic solution which enslaves us just the same.

According to stopbullying.gov:
"In 12 of 15 school shooting cases in the 1990s, the shooters had a history of being bullied."
Lets get real guys - most gun owners are responsible, as Obama says. The real cause of the﻿ school shootings still needs to be addressed - and that underlying cause is school bullying. If we really want to make children safer, the solution is to solve the underlying problem (bullying in schools), not to offer band-aid solutions like gun control.

Nobody is trying to take all of your guns away from you. We're just saying that machine guns should be illegal and people should receive a more thorough background check before they receive access to guns. ﻿ Looking at alot of the massacres and shootings that have occurred over the last 10-15 years, this IS common sense. These measure MIGHT help and if they might help then let's try it.

Machine guns are already illegal, and we already have background checks. But I have some more facts for you!
According to stopbullying.gov: "In 12 of 15 school shooting cases in the 1990s, the shooters had a history of being bullied."
We don't need to choose between 2nd﻿ Amendment rights and school safety if we just address the school bullying problem. What's more, addressing the bullying problem is something that should be done anyway - kids should enjoy school, not hate/fear it!

Because statistics show that in the United States, crime rates fell following the spread of right to carry laws, and they fell even more in areas that made firearms ownership mandatory. Also, because banning semi-autos is unconstitutional.
Furthermore, realize any discussion about gun control is going to divide the public, is probably not going﻿ to pass because we have a Republican House of Reps anyway, and largely serves to distract the public from the underlying problem (bullying).

Also, because we already tried an "Assault Weapons" ban. It was called the 1994 Crime Bill or something like that, it banned all the same things they﻿ want to ban now, and we still had school shootings (Columbine?)
Also, the guns the AWB banned were fundamentally the same as more commonly owned semi-autos like handguns, so why pass it? Also, the guns it banned weren't commonly used in crimes then, and aren't now, so the impact on safety is also negligible at best.

Why not have an "Assault Weapons Ban?" In one of your comments below, you said you can understand why people would want to own pistols. Do you realize that performance characteristics of pistols (which you say are acceptable to own) are largely the same as the performance characteristics of the "Assault Weapons" that Obama wants to ban? (They're both semi-auto).
Counter-question: why are pistols ok with you but not "Assault Weapons"? Most gun-related crime involves pistols, not﻿ AWs anyway.

Well that brings up another problem. So what now are we going to ban school bullying? We need to just let things play out naturally instead of trying to control every little thing that happens. This society babies everything so that no one knows how to protect themselves. We go crying to daddy government to save us everytime we feel﻿ a little uncomfortable.

Okay. I didn't know. Kill me, motherfucker. But why not ban semi-autos? Why the fuck not? And background checks for﻿ purchasing guns should be tightened. I mean, some recent shootings were instances involving men who were either bipolar or riddled with a history of mental illness. Should people like have access to guns?

You just said in your comment below (down a bit) that pistols are completely reasonable for a person to want to own. Pistols are semi-autos. I guess you answered your own question. :)
"And background checks for purchasing guns﻿ should be tightened."
We already have background checks. Most of the shooters who were old enough had clean records. Time to move on to addressing the bullying issue and not wasting time on guns.

(cont.) Guns aren't toys and your right to go to the shooting range and﻿ fire an assault weapon is just not a good enough reason to curb something that just might help prevent large scale massacres. Also, why would anyone oppose a lock down on legal loopholes that make it easier for criminals and unstable people to get access to guns?

The amount of dislikes on this video are not a reflection of what America feels about this at all. It's so obvious gun owners and right wingers flocked to this video to protest and express their disdain on this issue. I feel like limited access to "military-style assualt weapons" makes complete sense. I mean, please, one of you guys tell me: why do you need machine guns? I can understand pistols and rifles/shotguns for hunting? But﻿ why do you need assault weapons? It's so unneccessary.

The performance characteristics of standard pistols are essentially the same as the performance characteristics of so-called "Assault Weapons" like the AR-15. In other words, just the same as with commonly owned pistols, "Assault Weapons" shoot a single bullet with each pull of the trigger. They do not 'spray bullets,' they are not 'rapid-fire,' and﻿ they most definitely are NOT 'machine guns.'

As a brit i find it unbeleiveable that so many americans are still happy to put the lives﻿ of people like the children in the primary school shootings at risk, and are willing to continue to make it possible for further massacres to occur, just so they can keep their assult rifle. what possible argument can you make? and what possible logic can you have against what obama wants to do? why do you need an assult rifle? and why are you willing to let people die?

Less than﻿ 2% of gun violence in the country is with assault weapons it is ridiculous to target them as the problem. Leave it to the states to regulate their gun laws and the federal government to stay out of it. The us government will just screw it up just like they do with everything. Less guns equals less violence is your mentality. Look at Illinois and your going to see that's not true. Americans are warriors and they need to be armed warriors not sitting ducks.

Civilians having assault rifles is the﻿ same as civilians having full combat gear, grenades, chain-guns, rockets, tanks and helicopters in their yards. The 2nd Amendment predates the creation of the US Army and implicitly prohibits such an army, so it is already null and void just because the US Army exists.

Theres really no such thing as an "assault weapon", the word was derived from "assault rifle" which is a fully automatic machine gun. Assault weapon is a made up term referring to semi auto﻿ (1 shot per pull of the trigger) guns that look-like machine guns. Basically its "scary looking" semi autos.
But the proposed bill goes further, basically banning most semi automatic firearms, including hunting rifles, sporting shotguns and handguns. The legislation will basically ban 80% of modern guns

I use mine for hunting. It's the best hunting rifle in the﻿ world, and the most versitile. So shut the fuck up on things that you don't know about, and stop regurgitating false information you learned on the news.

If the 2nd Amendment only applies to muskets, doesn't that mean the 1st Amendment only applies to newspapers, books, and the spoken﻿ word? :) This guy must not have read the Supreme Court decision.
Thankfully, we don't have to choose between safe schools and the 2nd Amendment. According to stopbullying.gov: "In 12 of 15 school shooting cases in the 1990s, the shooters had a history of being bullied."
We should focus on preventing school bullying, not banning guns.

Dude a 5.56 round is tiny. It definately doesn't ruin meat like my 30-06. Also when I hunt turkey, I put a 22lr bolt in my AR. That's what I meant by versitile. I'm not a redneck, I'm﻿ an Apache.

There was already an "assault weapons ban" in Connecticut, and the kid stole the guns, he didnt buy them legally! So what new legislation would have prevented this?
What I think would have kept the kids more safe if teachers who have concealed carry permits are allowed to carry in school! They are already allowed to carry at the mall, the grocery store, the park, mcdonalds...all those places children are present, so why cant they carry concealed in the classroom. Keep the kids safe ﻿

i dont think that its mattes to any parent in Newtown who has lost a child if the weapon used was automatic or semi automatic.﻿ and your answer to the problem of guns in schools is (drum roll): bring MORE guns to school. genius. One solution that could do a bit good would be to have the gov. start a program to buy the guns back and make it illegal to own one so its either cash or legal charges.

So you are saying that in order to stop gun violence we should give more people more guns?
Where does this stop? Shall we give all the children guns as well, because the teacher might not always be around in time? Shall we position snipers on every school roof in the country? No, this is silly. It is not civilised. If you have to arm teachers to keep children safe, it should be obvious to anybody that there's something more﻿ fundamentally wrong.
The Columbine massacre used legally-bought guns.

Im not suggesting "we" give anyone guns, im suggesting people who already have a handgun and a permit to carry be allowed to carry not just in Wal Mart, Burger King, Playgrounds, the Beach, National Parks...kids are in those places, but also be allowed to carry in school. Gun free zones are free fire zones

Yeah theres less gun crime, but everyone in the UK has been stabbed at least once. So mind ur own business and stop trashing Americans favorite past time. You dont see me on tea and crumpet or pansy ass soccer vids, so lay off the gun vids

People from the UK comment on gun crime because it's illegal for us to carry guns.Just so your'e stupid self understands,the UK is not a country so if you must behave like a clever cunt at least point out an actual country rather than a group! also as you seem to understand our society why not explain that ie England has a much larger population % than the US when all things are considered so ie crime rates are obviously going to be﻿ a little mis-leading.You are the stereotypical American-STUPID.

When i have my pistol on me im safer and so is everyone else around me, if i saw someone being mugged by 5 people and i didnt have a gun, i couldnt do shit. More guns less crime

If guns were to be outlawed im guessing you'd see a huge rise in organised crime to compesnate which would open up a whole different 'can of worms'
It's a little idealistic to think the grass would be greener if a ban came into﻿ place but there has to be a change somewhere.

That figure could be used in what-ever way people deemed fit,both pro & anti ban supporters would be able to bash each other with it.
The justice system here in﻿ England (UK) has become absolutely unfit for purpose but thats another story.

That is the 'million $ question'
Personally i believe gun owners should be forced to undergo rigorous fit & proper tests that should also apply to family members in the same household.Guns shouldn't be as easy to get hold of legally,i see no reason whatsover why people have a whole catalogue of weapons? they are just suggestions﻿ but it's better to discuss what can be done rather than ignoring the issue & pretending it's a non-issue.

According to stopbullying.gov: "In 12 of 15 school shooting cases in the 1990s, the shooters had a history of being bullied."
Fixing the underlying problem (school﻿ bullying) is a much better way to make schools safer than to take away gun rights from responsible adults who need them for self-defense.

I love how when someone tries﻿ to convince you that your opinion is "wrong" they throw in emotion-grabbing things like "ohh think of the children, would you want to HARM them by OWNING A GUN!??!? Wont banning SEMI-AUTOMATIC rifles with high cap MAGAZINES SAVE THEM!?!?!". The answer is simple:No, Prohibiting any semi auto weapon will not stop illegal intent, never has, never will. I want to keep the kids safe, and I would do so with any tool I have at my disposal, from fists to firearm.

Do you really think the people watching this video represent an on-average equal and uniform distribution of the population of the United﻿ States? I'd say that since this video is connected to such petitions as the "deport Piers Morgan" one (1st amendment guys, come on), it's more likely to reach those that get angry at anyone who says they think guns should be controlled than a regular distribution.

Thank-you Mr. President for helping us to combat this horrific violence against innocent people. The vicitms are harmless citizens who are being attacked far too often because a few maniacs want to continue to permit assault weapons availability to anyone who chooses.
It has been said that there are two kinds of power political power and people power. We﻿ the people who favor a ban on the manufacture, sale and distribuiton of assault weapons are standing against violence. Hear our voices.

Because this proposed assault weapons ban would ban pretty much every gun out there. A semi auto gun is a gun that fires 1 bullet every time the trigger is pulled, yet when the media and obama calls them "assault rifles" or "military style"﻿ hes trying to trick people into thinking they are machine guns and they arnt
This legislation would include most hunting rifles, sporting shotguns, and handguns
FYI rifles are used in less than 3% of gun murders, and ar-15 is a subcategory of the rifle group

Well those things are the real underlying issues, but people know the Obama admin just wants an "Assault Weapons Ban"
Which most people in the gun industry say would make 80% of guns currently sold illegal. But not only that they would require that all people in current possession of those﻿ weapons, submit for photographing, fingerprinting, local sheriff permission, registration of such firearms...and when those people die the guns would be turned into the government for destruction..pathetic

There is a difference between military grade weapons (like assault rifles, miniguns, bazookas, RPG's,﻿ Submachine guns, ect., ect., ect.) And NON military grade weapons (Hunting rifles, shotguns, semi automatic pistols, revolvers, muzzle loaders, ect., ect., ect.). I Don't understand how you can see a ban on one group of weapons, but the continued legality of the other group of weapons, as being a ban on ALL weapons...

First, you need to realize that 'military grade' weapons such as assault rifles, rpgs,﻿ bazookas, and machine/submachine guns that are available to the mass pubic are not military grade. They are semiautomatic. Second, out of those who have permits to own fully automatic weapons, not a single permit owner has committed a serious crime in the past year. On another note, I strongly suggest that you check out the whitehouse.gov petition to ban hammers and baseball bats. You might learn a few things.

OMG really? You're taking every single petition that the masses put on that website as serious? I'm sure the person who petitioned to ban hammers and baseball bats is just as﻿ conservative as you are, and did so to illustrate how ridiculous a ban on all weapons is, which is pointless because there is no ban on all weapons on the table. Pay attention to the difference between a petition on a website and a bill in congress. maybe then YOU might learn something.

This is how to diminish inner city gun deaths.: require a conceled carry license to purchase bullets.70-80% of this nations murders are﻿ by young inner city males getting illegeal guns﻿ and going to Wal Mart and buying a box of 50 bullets.Conceled carry license requires a fee,range time,class time and a federal background check.This would be the Fed background check,it﻿ would eliminate felons,mentally sick,restraining orders and inner city young males.

those figures are rubbish, a large percentage of the violent crime in﻿ the UK is common assault hardly the same as gun crime, whilst you have 4 times the gun murders we do.
If you really think a full scale shootout would of helped in that school you are delusional. people carrying a firearm are 420% more likely to be shot and killed than an unarmed civilian. Why not just take the gun off the nutjob in the first place? then no one has to fire any bullets.

Crimes over all in the UK went up after the guns where banned. Just as crimes went up﻿ in the US where guns where banned. It is a proven fact gun crimes go down with an armed population. Take Switzerland for an example. It is also a proven fact that gun crimes go up when their is a gun ban, this is because criminals will not give up their guns. And if you think Obama cares ask him why he is killing children with drones. Or why they gave guns to cartels to blame on the second amendment?

If you ran your gun control like switzerland I would﻿ be very happy. Guns are only in such high ownership because everyone over the age of 18 has mandatory military service and is trained how to use a firearm. They also perform stringent medical health checks. Obama gave guns to cartels to blame the second amendment? hilarious.

So you think history never repeats it's self? Tell that to the Africans they forced vaccinations on at﻿ gun point recently, if you know anything about vaccinations you will know how sad that was. Obama is already acting like a dictator. Went to war with Libya without congressional approval because the UN told him too? Chaired the head of the UN against the constitution. And now executive orders on guns? I wish i could live in your fantasy land i really do.

same﻿ as every other US president before him did. Ofcourse history sometimes repeats itself usually because people dont change there ways and stick to outdated laws *cough* second amendment *cough*. If you think that US's allies wouldn't come down on them hard if they stepped out of line (economically etc), not to mention in the globalised world and how impossible the idea of a first world tyranical government is. your local militias are third world, start acting like a first world nation.

Id love to take the guns off the nutjobs, 2 shooters Jared Laugher and James Holmes were actually seeing psychiatrist and were on psychiatric drugs. That was a failure on the background check that should have denied them the ability to buy guns. The laws on the books﻿ need to be enforced in the first place!
If u want the full stats, not just US vs UK, US is #1 in gun ownership, #28 in gun homicide and #99 overall homicide. And in terms of violent crime the US is lower than a lot of Europe

Well 75%+ of homocide in the US is gang related and if u assume that most of them carry guns then that totally skews the stats.
What would be more objective is a survey of Legal Handgun Concealed﻿ Carry Permit Holders, id actually think that stat would be the other way around. Like u hear this crap like 40% of guns are bought without a background check, id think that most of them isn't an uncle selling his nephew his old hunting rifle, but would be illegal gang related sales.

well if you checked into the research, the data excluded homicides that the police thought to be gang related. So it should be representative of the﻿ general population. Also if you check the facts less than 20% of homicide is gang related in the US overall.... even the worst cities barely break 50%. I will not discuss stats with someone who is just making them up.

Germany's censorship is barbaric compared to the US (in all areas except public nudity). In Germany they outlaw music, games, movies, etc. You can't get away with that shit in the US.
You know what gives the US people leverage? About﻿ half the population with our 300 million or so guns.
It doesn't matter how many troops or bombs or drones or tanks you have. Unless you're ready to use nuclear weapons in US cities you're not stopping something like that. Even then you're probably still screwed.

after checking﻿ censorship laws in germany I dont see any differences (apart from one or two video games) that theyve censored. Id much rather that than the constant threat of gun violence. You think that you have leverage because you have a gun? leverage over what? are you talking about a turf war from another nation? because that is a ridiculous concept regardless of whether you have guns or not...

You didn't check hard enough then. Here, I'll help a bit: Rammstein's Liebe ist für alle da.
And again, I don't live under a constant threat of gun violence, and I live in a state with one of the highest violent crime rates in the country. Or maybe you're just a pussy. *shrug*
And yeah a gun gives me leverage, over﻿ everyone. It's the great equalizer.
What do you think WAR is dumbass?
Go back to your serfdom commoner. It's no wonder you lost your Empire and Hitler was kicking your ass.

hahahahaha oh wow i didn't lose anything, I﻿ am not my country, I am me and you are not america. Not wanting a gun makes me a pussy, that makes sense. The fact that you are making comparisons to war and putting war in a favourable light, is horrendous. If you like violence then I understand why you like guns but i dont. Good day.

Thinking people here live in constant fear because we have guns (and by doing so suggesting that you would live in constant fear with guns around) is what makes you a pussy.
It's easier to like war when you're the winner. We don't back down from a fight, we don't kiss﻿ anyone's ass, and we don't put up with bullshit. You step to us, we drop the mother fucking hammer. That's just how it's been since day 1.

1) Not a "WAR"
2) Didn't "lose" (draw really)
3) President fucked up by not sending enough troops in the first place, just like Iraq 2.0
4) Better to have pride in the nation I was arbitrarily born in﻿ than any of the "others" that I arbitrarily wasn't. Especially when dealing with someone who's from one of those "others" and talking shit about mine.
5) What entitles me to the history is that MY FAMILY were the OTHER PEOPLE who fucking did it, & my ancestors were on this continent before anyone.

3) you said you were a winner, you cant back off that now.
4) as i said, nationalism is fucking retarded. have pride in yourself not what people you dont even know did.
5) you are entitled to nothing, just like I'm not﻿ entitled to what my grandad did in ww2

All I read was number one, but technically Vietnam was﻿ not a war as only Congress has the power to declare war. The only wars we fought in the 20th century were WW1 and WW2. Strange system we have, right?

1) The US has not officially declared war since 1941. Congress never approved a declaration of war against the North Vietnamese. So according to US as well as international law the US did not enter into a WAR.
2) The US left in 73 due to political reasons, though the conflict did not actually﻿ end until 75 (the fall of Saigon).
3) Had it been an actual declared war full resources could have been used to better effect.
4) My family tree dates back to before Europeans were on this continent.

So since a FEW rare incidents, the rest of us have to be punished? I thought that justice for individual cases came down to the judicial court. If the government is just going to punish us innocent people anyways, whats the point of having a court system? This is fucking stupid. IF some psycho came to school and killed﻿ my kids, I hope the police get to him before I do.

No they did not. Look at who our founding fathers were. They were some of the smartest inventers in the world. Benjamin Franklin discovered electricty, and you're telling me he never thought for a second it could be used as a weapon? ﻿ They are directly responsible for our modern weapons.

Correct, Germany lacks many of the freedoms and rights we take for granted here in the US.
How is being armed oppressive? If anything it's liberating. It allows you a level of independence and self reliance that you otherwise would never be able to achieve on your own. I don't NEED a gun, I WANT one. I choose to exercise my rights because I can, it's my right to do so, not because I must. I﻿ also exercise this particular right in case the NEED ever arises.

I understand my beliefs are not that of other and the Supreme Court has ruled on it. I'm not on side with liberals on other issues as well...hence not an idealogue. If you have a problem with environmentalists you're as short sighted as I suspected.

now what are you going to do if 3 armed men break into your home if you only have 6 shots then you better make em count if you can even fire them fast enough. I don't know your definition of an assault weapon because all WEAPONS are assault weapons when do we ban nunchucks, swords, regular pistols where﻿ do we stop if assault weapons in your eyes are just large capacity guns then why are you not calling for a ban on cars that drive faster than the speed limit when will enough be enough

moron go back and look for me saying that has happened it was used as an analogy now you want to sit here and argue a hypothetical but u refuse to answer how you will protect your family now can this be because you﻿ would do it with a GUN and don't want to be called out for your hypocrisy or what. Now I can tell u of 3 cases here where I live I had 2 cousins as well as a person I know were all beaten to death by a similar tool as a bat a hammer I believe you said they were designed for nevermind

HAHAHA really we can't see the gray tones and you are constantly asking about bat massacres try looking up the word analogy if you can overcome your own hypocrisy long enough you pathetic little troll. And I agree with your point you never said anything about all guns you still think muskets are ok. Now what will happen if all "assault weapons" are banned and someone shoots a place up with handguns﻿ with no more than 10 bullets in a magazine but they have 5 or 6 magazines with them. What then?

I think you learned something today....good. Never use the﻿ false arguement with anyone ever again.
Are you going with the hypothetical situations again? What if a 20 year old shoots his mother in the head with her own gun and kills 20 first graders and 6 teachers?

While he may not have "created" it, Vice President Gore has supported and promoted the Internet. He was one of the first government officials to have a personal Web site and coined the phrase "information superhighway." In 1991, then Senator Gore authored the "High Performance Computing and Communications Act." As Vice President, Mr. Gore has﻿ promoted the expansion of Internet commerce and taken on Internet security and privacy issues.

bottom line when you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns.and the lunatic in connecticut did not use any rifle he used hand guns so that shoots﻿ down your theory of "assault weapons" and btw if they pass all the laws u want them to crime will still happen because CRIMINALS DON'T OBEY LAWS. take away all guns they will use knives take away knives they will use BATS take that away they will use whatever the hell they can find so then what let us BAN EVERYTHING TO INCLUDE YOUR FREE SPEECH MORON

Dude, you're talking out your ass again. The term assault weapon was created back in the early 90's to confuse retards like you into thinking it was the same thing as an assault rifle. The assault rifle is what you are﻿ refering to. The definition that the liberals created for assault weapon is any weapon that shares cosmetic features with an assault rifle. They are not created for killing humans. They were created for hunting, competition shooting, target practice and self defense.

You want a REAL solution? How about you include MANDATORY firearms education classes in public school systems so that this way, the youth of our nation is exposed to firearms in a positive more enlightening manner, rather than have them learn about them in violent movies and rap music that has been a culture of violence and rape in this country. When thats the only exposure to firearms that many Americans get, its no wonder that they see them as the worst things﻿ on the entire planet. Molon Labe!

Then we can take on the NWO. Anyone know where I can get the items when the shit hits the fan? Because once you fall, Canada will be next. It is to close to home.

Everyone should watch the Manchurian Candidate -- inside job shooters.

It says page not found,,,,,,, and you know the police here are a lot more corrupt right?
Here this, there has mean things were police have elbowed someone in the face for no reason, got sued, and the court said something like "He showed a well appropriate action and did not show lethal force.
The same cop﻿ then shot someone for no reason and even more, the cops there don't. Because they know they won't get away with it as well, let alone it's a small place, with ALOT of people.

Am I not supposed to clearly see that the man is reading from a teleprompter or﻿ other prop? Who wrote this response? What a puppet. To call gun owners "bitter clingers" one year, then turn around and try to address them with civility, is a joke and unacceptable.

Hey folasade: Thanks to your comment "WE SIMPLY HAVE TO KICK THE NRA'S BUTT", I just donated $100 to the NRA for you. "Thank you for your donation!" their website says. Wanna attack the Gun Owners of America too? They're more deserving than the NRA in my opinion.
By the way let﻿ me know when you have some solution for "FIXING OUR BROKEN FINANCE SYSTEM", I'd love to hear the opinion of someone who doesn't know Keynes from Hayek. And FFS, turn the caps lock off.

Mr President, "thank you" for not answering to our petition.
I have expected the direct response to "Deport British Citizen Piers Morgan for Attacking 2nd Amendment" petition, and all we (the people)﻿ got is scripted, convoluted, psy-ops style of teleprompter propaganda.
Maybe our president should change his name to Barak Hussein Teleprompter?

don't blame it all on him. it goes way back - the first attack on WTC didn't do it, not enough deaths, then was oklahoma-McVeigh was a stooge, then 9/11 which was an inside job btw. it's not like he has a choice- it's either play ball with the actual power brokers or end up like Lincoln or Kennedy- 4" to the left﻿ and i could add Reagan

I might be interrupting your trolling, but all you have to do is read the﻿ wikipedia entry for Illuminati (not "illuminate") in order to see their history. In fact, according to wikipedia, their original members included family members of what is now the royal family of England (House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha). Don't sit there and stupidly attack things that you know nothing about, and aren't willing to research. You just discredit yourself.

Don't you guys find that there have been lots of really strange events in the US? All of it resulting in less freedoms? It's almost like the extent that Communist & Fascist governments will go to deceive their citizens (IMO). They should write, "Going Postal 101", so shooters know how to target for maximum change in society. They should be targeting all the shady & corrupt politicians. This﻿ will keep politicians honest & room for advancement. Then I bet there will be no strange shootings!

If anything all Americans should be uniting together & lobbying for better weaponry for the National Guards. Also, the public should have control over their own National Guards for each respective states, so they can fight each other (if﻿ necessary) -- for FREEDOM!

eh, 2nd amendment is there to protect Americans against tyrannical governments. However in order to﻿ actually protect yourself against a powerful government, you need an established militia.
Problem is most people crying about 2nd amendment rights seem to forget the 2nd half of the amendment. No pun intended. Your ability to carry guns isn't going to protect you against government or invasion for that matter. As invasion occurs through the net as well. Your gun isnt protecting anyone.

I just want this on record for you as a Young Turks fanboi: "Your gun isnt protecting anyone." In REALITY,﻿ every day, crimes are averted by US citizens simply brandishing a firearm. All you have to do is investigate to confirm. You don't live in the reality that others do. Guns do, as a matter of fact, protect people from criminals, every day. That's just crime prevention; I won't even get into protection from tyranny and authoritarianism.

You do realize this argument can be completely reversed to benefit me as well right? The REALITY is that crimes are also caused due to numerous failings to do background checks, and constant illegal distribution of firearms through legal﻿ gun stores as well. You are also missing the point that I am making in my original statement to begin with.

If you geniunly believe your gun is going to protect you from tyranny and authoritarianism, without an established and organized militia that can﻿ rival a large government agency. You are an absolute idiot.
You are basically holding onto your gun because you feel it gives you more power, when in actuality it doesnt.

If you think it'll stop﻿ with registration, you'll be wrong, they'll push for confiscation with a list of every gun owner out there.

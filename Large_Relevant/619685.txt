4 Firefighters Shot, 2 Killed While Battling Flames In Upstate New York [UPDATED]

CNN reports this morning that two firefighters were shot and killed when they arrived to battle flames at a house in upstate New York. Another two were shot and injured.
Authorities believe someone began shooting at the firefighters shortly after their arrival on the scene in Webster, New York. As soon as they exited their vehicles, the shots began.
CNN notes that the gunfire prevented firefighters from extinguishing the flames for hours. Police SWAT teams evacuated homes in the area, as well.
Webster resident Michael Damico said, “The whole strip’s been evacuated. They’re evacuating all of the houses and going through them.”
Firefighters arrived at the home at 6 AM and by 9 AM, the fire had taken over three houses and a vehicle, according to Rob Boutillier, the local fire marshal.
Boutillier says one firefighter escaped from the scene unaided and was then transported to an area hospital by an ambulance from another location. He was determined to be in “satisfactory condition.” Another firefighter was wounded and unconscious when he was removed from the area. 
Boutillier told reporters,
“Our main concern right now is to have law enforcement evacuate the people in harm’s way (and) make the scene safe for the fire department. And then the fire department will go in and do its job.”
MSNBC reports that there is currently no active shooter.
The story is still developing…
Update: Officials now believe the firefighters were victims of a “trap” set specifically to lure them to the scene. The murdered firefighters were identified as Lt. Mike Chiapperini and Tomasz Kaczowka. Theodore Scardino and Joseph Hofsetter were injured.
Update: The shooter has been identified as 62-year-old convicted killer William Spengler. Spengler had a lengthy criminal history and was charged with murdering his grandmother in the 1980s. He was found dead at the scene with a self-inflicted gun shot wound.

Its not the guns. This guy could have killed these two firefighters and wounded the other two with a baseball bat. Or a slingshot. Or a bow and arrow. Or a blowdart. Or a kitchen knife or some really hard snowballs.  Nothing to see here folks. Im proud to be part of a country where there have been more indiscriminate killings by guns  in the last week than there were in the whole United Kingdom last year. Go USA. Two more families destroyed without fathers, on christmas eve.  The NRA told me that they were pro family.

Every fire truck needs an armed guard.  Plenty of retired vets out there who’d be willing to do the job for peanuts.  Problem solved, you’re welcome.

1) You just linked to the Weekly Standard.  2) Since when does David Gregory represent all liberals?  3) Its the same school Obama’s kids go to.  OF COURSE they’ll have security.






Orestes Ippeau



Firefighting teams should be supplemented with squads of armed elementary school teachers, or, during the Christmas season, in celebration of the birthday of Baby Jesus, armed toddlers.

If only the fire had a gun, none of this would have happened. Fires are people, too, my friends.

They had armed security before Obama’s precious children started attending.

Who cares? Hire armed security everywhere I don’t care. But don’t be bitching that it costs to much.  Thats my problem. You guys want to hire a bunch of people train them buy them guns and then scream because your taxes go up.

Yes good idea raise taxes on people who don’t make a lot of money. And you wonder why Romney lost. Your side is so clueless its not even funny. Again Obamas kids go to a private school they can hire whatever security they want. Public schools have a couple ways to go. Use taxpayer money to hire private security or ask for a police officer. Either way thats going to cost you the taxpayer a lot of money. And again I don’t care. But in 4 years you will be bitching about how the government has hired more workers and spending has gone up and how we are turning into greece.  Marching in tea party parades screaming protect our kids government but we don’t want to pay for it! Its a spending problem not a tax problem! And all your other baloney.

Ok cabbage I guess I cant convince you that more security will cost more money. Somehow in your brain you have figured it out that more security will cost less money.  My head spins at you logic. If I cant even convince you that putting guards at all schools in this country along with training them will cost the tax payer money then I am not going to be able to convince you of anything.

Obama’s kids have the school security AND a Secret Service detail

WTF is your point! Why do you keep saying this! What is wrong with you people?

I think the “logic” is that since the President and his family are protected 24/7 by a Secret Service detail, it makes him (the President) a hypocrite for thinking fewer guns would make the rest of us safer, when obviously a Secret Service detail for every American would be the way to go.
And it wouldn’t cost much,either!  We just get those retired/unemployed vets to do the job for peanuts!  Problem solved, you’re welcome.

Webster Police Chief Gerald Pickering identified the shooter in today’s tragedy
 along the lake shore in that community as William Spengler, 62.
	Spengler was reportedly found on the beach, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head.
	Pickering said Spengler’s sister, who also reportedly lived at 191 Lake
 Road, where the fire is believed to have started, is still unaccounted
for.
	Pickering also said it appears Spengler started a house and car on fire
 to lure emergency responders to the area, and was likely laying in wait
 with a gun and ammunition. He also said another Webster police officer
exchanged fire with Spengler, likely saving other lives.
	“It appears it was a trap,” Pickering said. “He (Spengler) laid in wait with armament.”
	Spengler was convicted in the suspicious death of his grandmother in
1981, Pickering said, served time in prison, and was on supervised
parole from 1998 to 2006.
	Pickering said this afternoon that a total of seven homes was destroyed
 by this morning’s blaze, and that it’s still an active investigation,
with support from New York State Police and the Monroe County Sheriff’s
Office.
	Al Sienkiewicz, public information officer for the West Webster Fire
Department, said Mike Chiapperini, who was one of two killed in the
incident, was a past chief and just two weeks ago was named the
department’s firefighter of the year. He was also an advisor with the
department’s Explorer Post.
	Sienkiewicz also said Kaczowka, the second firefighter killed, was with the department just over a year.
	The two injured, Hofstetter and Scardino, were also active with the
Explorers, as was Kaczowka, Sienkiewicz said, adding that Scardino was a
 transfer from Irondequoit’s Laurelton Fire Department.
	“This is a tragedy that is felt by all of us — deeply,” added
Pickering, noting that he has been taking calls from across the nation.
	New York’s Lt. Governor, Bob Duffy, was also part of this afternoon’s press conference.
	“I’ve never in my career seen anything like this …. It is unspeakable and unthinkable,” he said, “that this could happen.”
	Pickering said police and firefighters are still hoping that everyone
was able to escape “the inferno,” and that they don’t find any
additional bodies as the investigation and fire cleanup continues.

Be interesting to see where he got whatever weapon he had. This is actually the worst. This guy did this on purpose setting the firefighters up. Now cops are going to have to escort firefighters to fires, taking up more resources and more money. God what is going on in this country.

Spengler was convicted of first-degree manslaughter in 1981 for beating
his 92-year-old grandmother Rose Spengler to death with a hammer; he
served 17 years in prison and had an “uneventful” parole that ended in
2006. Rose Spengler was killed in the house next-door to the house where
 firefighters were responding today. Webster Police Chief Gerald
Pickering said that because Spengler was a convicted felon, he couldn’t legally own guns; Pickering said investigators found “several different types of weapons, including a rifle used on first responders.”
 He added that mental health issues were probably involved.

You people rejoice in killing babies, so I guess that’s why you don’t call for banning scalpels? All YOU people, liberal JOs, should move to a common community and post that you are living in a ‘GUN FREE ZONE. See how long you people survive. It’s people with guns, that keep YOU idiots safer in your neighborhoods. But then again, being liberal idiots, you can’t comprehend that fact. Let’s try to explain another way.

You﻿ can survive at 0C (32F) naked for any amount of time, just as long as you eat something like 5,000 calories a day and coil up in a ball in order to sleep, otherwise you could loose a finger or a toe.

You got 2 things wrong. At 0 C you can live longer than 20 minutes, for proof check out vsauce 2 where last episode where the guy is working out in a thong in the snow. Second, 500,000,000 people where infected but between 20-40 million world wide, which would make more since if 3% of the﻿ population died. Because estimated population was 1.6 billion, not 3.3 billion.

Plague isn't really a problem these days because most people have inherited natural resistance to it. All the susceptible people died back in the middle ages.
We're even seeing the rise of humans, mainly in Africa, who are resistant to malaria as well.﻿

I don't think the one about 0 degrees centigrade, no clothes and dying within 3 minutes is correct. We do P.E in﻿ winter in the snow in under 0 degrees temperatures wearing only thin T-shirts and shorts for an hour. Although running about will generate heat, I wouldn't think it would generate so much that if we didn't then we would die within, say 10 minutes. What do you think?

Speaking of skepticism, it is interesting that the reference to "half the deaths during history is from malaria" is a verbatim quote (supposedly from virologist Blumberg) that floats unreferenced on the web.
Let's use the video's own numbers. If we have a stable﻿ death rate of 10 per 1000 every year, i.e. people live on average 100 years, with the current population of 7 billion we would have 70 million deaths/year. But the estimate of malaria is 1-2 million/year dead, not 30-40.
So, no.

if no one on the planet had heard a piece of music, lets say mr brightside by the killers, then if you were to give the lyrics to everyone on the planet and ask them all to sing it. is there a chance that someone who hadnt heard the song to sing the lyrics in the same tone, pitch and tempo so it sounds the same... its an odd question i know but is it impossible for someone who has not heard a piece of music to sing it in the same﻿ way with only the words to the song. thanks :)

100 million is NOT 3% of the 1918 world population. That would mean the population would exceed﻿ 3.3 billion people.
64.8 million people, 3.6% of the 1918 world population, died from the Spanish Flu. The total world population was 1.8 billion people.

100 M people﻿ was not 3% of the world's population in 1920. It was about 12%, if you want to be more accurate. And 100 M is the most "optimistic" approximation.

Hey, I had an intriguing﻿ question pop up whilst I was having lunch with my family a few days ago. We were eating Cajun food, and I had pondered on the question of why we call Hot Sauce, Hot Sauce. It's not because of the temperature, but because of whats in it, and what it makes us do. Sweat, but not heat up physically. So, what causes those spices to make us feel "hot" without being in physically warmer temperatures? And why do we sweat from those spices?

An interesting question, the﻿ opposite also happens with menthol, it gives you a cold sensation but doesn't lower the temperature. I think i read somewhere that it was because the sense of taste missinterpretates those chemical reactions with the ones from heat and cold, or something like that

We say 'hot' because it 'feels' hot, but in reality its because of the molecular reaction enzymes have with your skin. Basically, its tenderizing your skin. Another way to say it,﻿ its eating you alive. hehe.. Eating (or ingesting) too much of these type of enzymes will weaken your stomach lining, causing all sorts of medical problems. The key is moderation.

There is a chemical called Capsaicin, which is an alkaline﻿ oil. It has a unique shape, I don't know if this is relevant to the "hotness" though. Anyway, ammals such as ourselves have a specific receptors in our tongues which causes us to feel pain from heat. The Capsaicin attaches to those receptors and causes calcium ions to flow in, making us feel like we are burning, even though we are not. If I remember correctly, what affects the hotness is the amount of Capsaicin or how concentrated it is.

Capsaicin is the culprit at play. It's a little molecule that﻿ binds to receptors that sense heat and abrasion. After combining to these receptors Capsaicin acts like a gate that channels calcium into the nerve causing it to think something hot is in your mouth.

Here's a question for you.... What is outside the universe? If the Universe is expanding, what is it expanding into? Or are we shrinking ._. Are there multiple universes?? Would the space outside the universe be so hostile that it would rip protons and neutrons apart and throw the sub-atomic particles in opposite directions? ﻿

Hey Michael, love your vids. Here's a question..what would happen if all your body's cells simultaneously became tumor cells...as in, they all would replicate infinitely (let's just say they were benign). Let's also say that they all would replicate at the average rate that they already do in the body (as some replicate faster than others). If you could continuously supply yourself with energy for upkeep, could you live forever? Thought this would be interesting!Cheers, and keep﻿ up the good work

A tumor cell does not do anything for the body. It only supports itself, without having any function, because it is not differentiated. So if all of your cells become tumor cells in one moment,﻿ practically you'll sieze to exist as an organism, and the cells will live a short amount of time until they exhaust all the resources (like oxygen, proteins, carbohydrates, etc) stored in your body.

No, because basic ageing is caused by anomalies in the duplication﻿ process, as cells divide they become less perfect, eventually resulting in so many flaws that the body dies, the same would be true of tumor cells, whilst they would be replicating, each copy would be slightly worse than the other....exactly the same as normal cells. Sorry, no eternal life just yet

They wouldn't be able to become better, only maintain their current state, which would mean perfectly copying the DNA. This is supposedly possible, but not for hundreds and hundreds of years. Our body is the most efficient method of checking DNA, since each time a cell replicates, there﻿ are thousands of safeguards in making sure the DNA is copied just right.

That's how they﻿ are, except the radiation from the sun, light, and well, pretty much everything, slowly destroys the cells, and eventually causes your death.

I think you have just become more aware of the car or song. So in the past when you just passed it off as seeing﻿ just come other care or listening to just some other song, it registers in your mind more significantly because you are more aware of that one in particular.

Alright, alright fair enough... Although I'm on a mobile so cannot﻿ see the description... Isn't that prejudice?? P.s you may have just made a spelling error on the word description so I would not criticise someone else's comment when you have indeed made a mistake yourself... Not everyone in this world is an idiot so I would not treat others with that lack of respect.

A small FACT he failed to mention about the plague in Europe back then:
It spread so quickly because priests and christian "healers" asked everyone to kiss the crosses they had... you know for cure﻿ AND prophylactic reasons. For the one true god to save them all... ye, they had no clue about anything smaller than insects.
So these men of god walked from house to house and let everyone kiss the same crosses.
I am amazed how many people rather overlook this FACT.

allso in some places in norway, they would cut off a peace of you skin that was black under the "black death". this worked, but what they did wrong with this﻿ was that they used the same knofe over end over agien, and they did not clean it. :/

To every 1 person alive there are 15 dead, does anyone else think that that doesn't sound like very many at all? Obviously the world Is way more populated now than it ever has but that still deosn't sound enough, I mean the human race has been around﻿ for some time right, and not everyone is fortunate enough to live their full expected lifespan...

50% of all people were killed by malaria? That's just pure bullshit. Did the researchers took current population as if there were always that many people in the world? Same as 93% of all people are dead - I highly doubt﻿ that. 80% would probably be more close to the true number, though it's not really possible to calculate with precision.

Can you make a video on the science of singing? For example, why can some﻿ people be great singers, and some people be almost tone deaf? What differentiates falcetto and normal singing, and why is there a range of notes just below someone's falcetto, that said person cannot sing?

I'm sorry if you don't care, you don't need to reply to me but me and my friend make some videos that in our opinion are really funny they take a long time to film and edit so it would mean a lot if you just stopped by to check﻿ out our newest video just to see if you'll like us and maybe watch more, or even subscribe
It would mean a ton to us if you did

{Here are some extra suggestions}
Is the universe infinite, if not what would happen if we went at the edge?
Is time infinite, how did it start (theories) ?
How cold can it get (freezing and liquefying gasses) ?
What futuristic items (hover-board, portal gun, flying car, teleporter, etc) can possibly be made?
Are there any other senses (vision, touch, etc) that exist in the universe ?
How many people are there (including the dead)?

as far as how cold it can get its absolute zero, which is -273.15 "c ish﻿ i think and its a point of which atoms cannot move, in thereo infinatly cold, when something is submitted to this (or close) temprature and is not yet sold (helium) you get a super liquid, they have ridiculassly low density and can pass through holes to small for normal gas helium aswell and the ability to go up the ridge of a glass aslong as theres a bigger down on the other side, just googe "super liquid helium"

For how cold can it get, the answer is absolute 0. In other words, 0K, -273 degrees C or −459.67 degrees fahrenheit. At this temperature, atoms do not move, nor do the electrons. Though we have never actually gotten there and this is "just" a theory, we have gotten 0.0007K away from absolute 0 and experienced a﻿ state of matter both Bose and Einstein predicted would happen called the Bose-Einstein Condensate.

Actually,it came from the fleas on the rats.The fleas had﻿ the bacteria in them and when the rats came near the human the fleas jumped on the and bit them.The rats were carriers though and could give it to the humans as well.It originated from the far east and when traders arrived in the areas in which the fleas and mice lived the mice boarded the ship and begun the pandemic known as the "Bubonic Plague". I'm not fully sure that the fleas bit the humans but I am pretty sure that's what happened.

I grew up in West Africa for 17 years, and got malaria at least 4 times while I was there. It's very common to hear of people getting the virus, but it's incredibly easy to prevent and cure, and the medication (and prevention drugs) are inexpensive compared to other drugs. The only reason so many people still die from malaria is because they don't have access (financially﻿ or physically) to the anti-malarial drugs.
Sometimes it's as simple as a mosquito netting and garlic.

Water is Hydrogen and Oxygen. Helium is nonflammable and so is oxygen. The reason H2O is not flammable is because the compound has a higher energy﻿ level than both hydrogen and oxygen because of the covalent bond (and shared electrons). Since there is no extra energy level, there is no potential energy for water to emit if it could burn.

Hello Michael,
If possible, it would be amazing if in one of your next videos you could talk about the supposed achievement of negative kelvin temperatures. I﻿ read about it @huffingtonpost .﻿ com in an article about "absolute zero record setting negative temperature" but I'm not as capable of understanding it without an active explanation as I'd like hehe.
Thank you for your time.

A scarier statistic...10 out of 10 people die. Soooooooo where are you going after you die? Heaven or Hell? Heres a test. Have you ever told a lie? How about stolen something like food off of someone else's plate? The Bible says if you have even done these then you﻿ will be guilty and end up in Hell. BUT Jesus who is God died for you and rose again, that if you REPENT of your sins and BELIEVE Jesus died for YOU, and you TRUST in Him, YOU WILL BE SAVED! apologize and believe, trust Him

Religion didn't make your friend kill himself, that was a choice. Religion is good. Christians feed﻿ the hungry when noone else will. We take in the poor when others push them away. Everyone that holds grudges against us is always blinded by their own thoughts. You need to grow up and look at the bigger picture.

How dare you, you don't know his struggle. Christian ideas forced him into the closet his entire life, never to speak of who he was inside and never to feel love with anybody like everyone else gets to, and when he finally did come out, his family turned on him, they forbid him round for Christmas day because it's a 'religious festival', he died on boxing day. The teachings promoted by Christianity killed him, and he had a life more miserable﻿ than you could imagine because of that.

The﻿ Church has stated that homosexual desires or attractions are not themselves sinful. They are said to be disordered in the sense that they tempt one to do something that is sinful, but temptations beyond one's control are not considered sinful in and of themselves. While the Church does oppose attempts to legitimize same-gender sexual acts, it also urges respect and love for those who do experience same-sex attractions. Thus the Church also opposes violence against people with gay relations.

The church promotes a belief﻿ that sexuality is a choice, which frankly is self-defeating and ridiculous, but one that in Christian eyes justifies the discrimination of gay people, it justifies a father beating his child because he's 'chosen' to be gay, it justifies his mother disowning him, it causes somebody to live a lie to the point where they can't take it anymore, it instils so much self-hate in them that they just want to die, you have no idea about the damage Christian beliefs can do.

(cont.) You're so blinded by religion and so convinced that you've found the one true set of teachings, out of the MILLIONS that are and have been gone before it, that you refuse to question anything﻿ about it. Sorry who's blind here? The guy who builds beliefs on logic, knowledge and evidence? Or the guy who believes everything he's told from one source, EVEN though much of it is factually incorrect? You are the blind one, no question about it.

(cont.) Christians aren't the only ones who do charity,I've probably done more than you have, get off your high horse you condescending fuck. If you think that being a Christian means you're kinder﻿ than anybody else just take a look at Westboro baptist church, THANKING god for natural disasters with no empathy instead of out helping those who are suffering them, picketing funerals with absolutely no care for the family, and these people believe THEY are the moral ones, just like you do.

(cont.) Uganda is currently proposing the death penalty for homosexuality, this is the slaughter of innocent people in the name of Christianity, and if only it was the first time, Christianity has caused more wars and genocide than ANY other cause.
What's﻿ morality today? We don't believe in slavery anymore, We believe in equality of women, being kind to animals, These things have NO basis in religious texts, we got here through logic and reason, NOT through religion.

Okay, that was deep. But that's not the point. I was fine with you, I really was. I simply pointed out your hypocrite comment. BTW, someone isn't homophobic when they think of gays below them. That's discrimination, not homophobia. When﻿ I said 1.5 billion people are homophobic, I meant that from your definition. And don't talk to me about friends dying. Two of my best friends just died when a drunk driver crashed into them. And religion does no harm. People make it do harm. (continued next)

Something interesting about the plague is that it didn't kill anyone in the town of Falun in Sweden. Why? Because the amounts of heavy metals, ex Cadmium & Lead, where so high in the vicinity of the Falunmine that the rats who carried the plague died in a short period of time. The peasants around﻿ the mine also had alot of cattle to provide material for the mine, in effect of which the area had alot of food. The average life expectancy for that area and time period was also the highest in Sweden.

I was talking about it being set on fire in the air because of﻿ the sheer speed, not two things sliding against each other.

noooo, the ozone layer and upper atmosphere does that because of the heat absorbed by the ozone layer.
that's why everything heats up to around 2500 centigrade when it﻿ advances into or outside the earth.

Well to get heat energy from movement it would require the energy change from kinetic energy to heat energy, which you can find by using the equation (1/2 mass x velocity) to find the kinetic energy and (specific heat capacity x mass x change in temperature) for heat energy. And presuming the energy isn't lost to other forms, and you﻿ knew the temperature for the material to come alight, you could find out the answer for yourself. Hope that helped :)

Sorry (1/2 mass﻿ x velocity squared) is the correct equation for kinetic energy.

That would happen because of air friction,﻿ but the speed required would depend on the size and flammability of the object.

@DynamicUnreal Your groin was covered. That is the easiest place to lose heat. Being naked means that not a single area of your body is covered, making it impossible to store heat, anywhere. What a﻿ difference a pair of boxers make!

Notice how not a single Rubik's cube﻿ was solved. XD But as I've learned, you don't need to be highly intelligent to solve a Rubik's cube, you just need a good memory. I have a fairly average level intelligence, but solving a Rubik's cube is child's play to me.

All those places are dangerous, sure enough, but none of them have a mortality rate of 100%. There are people who've gone to Mt Everest, the Mariana Trench and Chernobyl and lived to tell the tale. There's one place on earth that does have a 100% mortality rate. And it's in Yorkshire, England. The Bolton Strid is a river of a few feet wide but several meters deep (nobody's certain how much). The strong underwater currents pull down EVERYBODY who's﻿ ever gone in there, and they dissappear forever.

   A powerful explosion rocks the oil and gas company's headquarters  

T.W. | MEXICO CITY
http://www.economist.com


  AT LEAST 25 people have been killed and 100 injured by a large explosion at the Mexico City headquarters of Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil and gas company. The explosion happened at about 4pm on January 31st. So far there is no official word on what caused the blast, with media reports variously citing exploding machinery or gas leaks. There is not yet any suggestion of foul play.Gas explosions have been responsible for tragedies at Pemex facilities in the past. In September 30 people were killed by a blast at a plant in Reynosa, by the Texan border. Previous decades saw worse tragedies: about 200 were killed by gas explosions in Guadalajara in 1992, and an accident at a gas plant on the edge of Mexico City killed more than 300 in 1984.Thursday's disaster took place at the company's administrative headquarters, where there is no processing of combustible material. The 52-storey Pemex Executive Tower is located in the heart of Mexico City, close to the swanky neighbourhood of Polanco. With its severe facade and unusual two-storey "hat" it is one of the city's most distinctive structures. The explosion took place in the lower floors of a building adjoining the main tower. It is not yet clear to what extent the tower, which withstood the devastating 1985 earthquake, has been shaken by the blast.The grand but slightly shabby building reflects the fortunes of the company that occupies it. Commissioned following the oil rush of the 1970s, its vastness speaks of a time when it seemed that Mexico's oil would never run out. These days, with oil production much lower than during the glory years, the tower looks a bit the worse for wear.Later this year Enrique Peña Nieto, Mexico's new president, is expected to present a long-awaited energy reform, geared towards making Pemex more efficient. Last year's accident in Reynosa underlined the urgent need for better management at the company. Reports on the cause of Thursday's blast will be anxiously awaited.]]>

   The Cuban government grants a passport to a critical blogger  

The Economist online
http://www.economist.com


  WHEN Cuba announced last October that, after more than 50 years, it was removing the requirement of an exit permit for its citizens wishing to travel, one person it was widely assumed would not be granted that right was Yoani Sánchez. The blogger’s acerbic comments on some of the absurdities and hypocrisies of life in contemporary Cuba have made her the island’s best-known critical thinker abroad. Over the past decade, the authorities have repeatedly refused her requests to leave the country, often to attend award ceremonies or seminars connected with her blog. The change in the law specifically included a caveat that permission could be denied to anyone for “national security” reasons, a clause that seemed to have been written with Ms Sánchez in mind.Ms Sánchez held out little hope. On January 30th she wrote about the “long slumber” of bureaucracy in Cuba, after being told that there was no news about her passport request. But just a few hours later, she was amazed to be told the document was ready for collection. She has indicated she will travel very soon, though she has not specified a destination. The government has said that the new law gives anyone with a passport both the right to leave Cuba and to return, so it appears that she will be able to come back after she leaves.The decision is evidence that the government is changing its tactics towards its critics. Under Fidel Castro, vocal dissidents effectively found themselves with two options: imprisonment or permanent exile. For generations of Cubans, emigration became the only form of protest. The United States has made that easier by offering any Cuban who sets foot in the country near-automatic political asylum. Mr Castro, who used to describe those who left Cuba as “scum”, is probably proud of how the policy worked in his favour. His loudest, and most numerous, critics were safely off the island.Mr Castro’s younger brother and successor as president, Raúl Castro, seems to believe that the time has come to let Cubans come and go, whatever their political views. This is largely an economic decision. Most of the investment flowing into the small private businesses that he now permits, which relieve pressure on the hugely inefficient state sector, comes from Cubans living abroad. Barack Obama’s removal of all almost all restrictions on Cuban-Americans sending money or travelling to Cuba has helped that process. One of the more high-profile beneficiaries of the easier rules is José Contreras, a pitcher in America’s Major League Baseball. He defected from Cuba in 2002, but last month returned for the first time to see his family and take a jog on the beach.But letting Ms Sánchez travel is not without risk. It will raise her profile in Cuba, as she will presumably take the opportunity to appear on international television networks. Although they are not legally broadcast inside Cuba, they can be seen via black-market satellite systems and pen-drive recordings. For the first time, a small, but perhaps significant, number of Cubans will be able to watch another Cuban who still lives on the island criticise the system in a public forum.The government could of course rescind Ms Sánchez’s travel privileges, or those of anyone else it chooses. Some dissidents have already been told that they will not be given passports, including those that were imprisoned during a 2003 clampdown and are technically on parole after they were released in 2010-11. But Ms Sánchez has escaped their fate. Officials at the foreign ministry privately reserve their most contemptuous, and sexist, swearwords to describe her. Perhaps their boss does not afford her enough respect to consider her a potential threat.Correction: An earlier version of this post mistakenly said that Ms Sánchez is a single mother. She is currently living with her husband and son in Havana.]]>

   A former dictator is charged with genocide  

T.W. | MEXICO CITY
http://www.economist.com


  GUATEMALA’S civil war, which ran for 36 years until 1996, was one of the darkest episodes in Latin America’s recent history. A UN-sponsored truth commission estimated that 200,000 people were killed during the conflict, most of them Mayan villagers, who in many cases were killed by the state security forces. Some of the worst butchery took place in 1982 and 1983, during the dictatorship of Efraín Ríos Montt, an army general who led the country for 17 months.Mr Ríos Montt, now 86 years old, looked set to live out his life without having to answer for the crimes alleged to have taken place under his command. But on January 28th a Guatemalan court ruled that he should stand trial for genocide and crimes against humanity. It is the first time that a former president has been charged with genocide by a Latin American court. That it should have happened in Guatemala, a country where impunity has long been the norm, is stunning.Prosecutors are preparing charges against Mr Ríos Montt for the killing of 1,771 indigenous Ixil people, who are believed to have been killed in 15 massacres between 1982 and 1983. The Ixil were seen as supporters of left-wing guerrilla fighters who were at war with the state. The prosecution argues that Mr Ríos Montt wanted to wipe out the Ixil entirely, as part of a scorched-earth policy in which entire villages were destroyed, and their inhabitants murdered or simply “disappeared”.In spite of the atrocities committed during his time in power, Mr Ríos Montt enjoyed something of a political comeback, including an unsuccessful presidential run in 2003. Until last January he served as a member of Guatemala's National Assembly, which gave him immunity against prosecution. But when his term ran out last year he was placed under house arrest. His lawyers argue that he is protected by an amnesty law dating from the end of the conflict.The announcement of a trial, 30 years on from the alleged crimes, is another sign that Guatemala is tentatively improving its awful record for impunity. As we reported last week, the country’s justice system appears to be getting a firmer grip on crime, which is falling at last after several years of steep increases. The case against Mr Ríos Montt will be the biggest test yet of whether Guatemalan justice is up to the enormous challenges it faces.]]>

   Argentina and Iran agree to form a commission to investigate the 1994 AMIA attack  

H.C. | BUENOS AIRES
http://www.economist.com


    ARGENTINA’S foreign policy has grown increasingly combative in recent months. In addition to turning up the heat in its longstanding dispute with Britain over control of the Falkland Islands, the government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner also nationalised a Spanish-controlled oil company without providing a penny of compensation and sparred with Ghana over the impoundment of a naval frigate.This week Argentina added Israel to its list of burnt bridges. On January 27th its foreign ministry announced the country would collaborate with Iran to form a joint truth commission that will investigate the 1994 car bomb attack at AMIA, a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires. No one has been convicted for involvement in the bombing, which killed 85 and injured 300. But Argentine prosecutors, Interpol, Israel and Jewish advocacy groups have all publicly accused Iran of directing the attack and dispatching Hizbullah to execute it.The long investigation of the bombing has been marred by corruption, obfuscation and political intrigue. Despite the confidence of the Argentine courts, some important sources still question whether Iranian officials actually ordered the attack. James Bernazanni, a former head of the Hizbullah unit at America’s Federal Bureau of Investigation and assistant to Argentine investigators, has said that although he suspects Iran did participate in the attack, the Argentines have only offered tenuous proof.Iran denies all involvement, and hopes the new commission will establish its innocence. If approved by the legislatures in each country, as expected, it will consist of five members that cannot be native to either Argentina or Iran—two appointed by each country—plus a president agreed upon by both. The commissioners will review all of the information gathered by each side, allow Argentine authorities to interview suspects in Tehran and eventually make suggestions in line with each country’s laws.On January 27th Ms Fernández called the accord “historic” no fewer than 10 times on Twitter. “Historic,” she wrote, because “after almost 19 years since the AMIA bombing, we’ve achieved for the first time a legal instrument of international law between Argentina and Iran to advance knowledge of the truth about the attack.”Israel begs to differ. Its foreign ministry summoned the Argentine ambassador to explain the decision, and released a statement saying he had been made aware of the country’s “astonishment and disappointment”. The statement also said Argentina had displayed an “unacceptable attitude” towards Israel.Many prominent Argentine Jewish leaders agree. They argue that Iran will never allow the commission to reveal incriminating information. “How will it be possible to close the case by collaborating with those who have denied any part in the bombing?”, asks Sergio Widder, the Latin America director for the Simon Wiesenthal Center. “Furthermore, how can Argentina trust a totalitarian regime with absolutely no respect for human rights?” Both AMIA itself and DAIA, the country’s umbrella Jewish group, issued a statement criticising the agreement. The reaction abroad has also been harsh: David Harris, the executive director of the American Jewish Committee, likened the formation of the commission to “asking Nazi Germany to help establish the facts of the Kristallnacht”.The decision could cause further tension between the Argentine government and the country’s Jewish community, which is the world’s seventh-largest and by far the biggest in Latin America. Ms Fernández’s late husband and predecessor as president, Néstor Kirchner, was viewed fondly by many Argentine Jews. He was credited with reviving the AMIA case after many years of inefficient investigation, and frequently met Jewish leaders. During his presidency the Argentine courts formally charged eight Iranian officials, including a former president of the country, for involvement in the AMIA attack.After taking office, Ms Fernández bolstered her standing with la colectividad—as Argentine Jews often call themselves—by appointing numerous Jews to high cabinet positions. They include Axel Kiciloff, the deputy economy minister, and Héctor Timerman, the foreign minister. The selection of Mr Timerman was particularly notable because his father Jacobo was a well-known Jewish newspaper editor, who fled to Israel after being jailed and tortured during Argentina’s 1976-83 military dictatorship.In late 2011, however, Ms Fernández poured cold water on the relationship by softening her diplomatic stance towards Iran. That year, the Argentine delegation did not walk out of the speech at the annual UN general assembly meeting given by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran’s president, as it had done for years in the past. Earlier this year, Jewish leaders were alarmed to hear reports that Argentine officials were talking to their Iranian counterparts about finding a joint solution to close the case.Iran’s interest in the accord is easy to understand. Because of the harsh economic sanctions levied on the country over its nuclear programme, it is suffering from shortages of many essential goods, and is desperate for allies and trade partners. Argentina has not honoured the sanctions, and has become the seventh-biggest exporter to Iran, mainly supplying the country with corn, soyabeans and wheat. During Ms Fernández’s presidency, Argentine exports to Iran have soared from $319m to $1.08 billion.Argentina’s rationale is less obvious. According to Sergio Berenzstein, a political consultant, Ms Fernández may be cozying up to Iran as a gesture of support to its leftist allies in Latin America, such as Cuba and Venezuela, as well as seeking to promote a “multi-polar world” not dominated by the traditional Western powers. But she could have economic reasons for improving ties to Iran as well. Argentina’s interventionist policies have forced it to import ever-greater amounts of energy. And Iran is likely to offer generous terms to any country willing to thumb its nose at the West and buy Iranian oil.This post was updated on January 30th.]]>

   Chinese knockoffs flood Colombia's hat market  

S.B. | BOGOTÁ
http://www.economist.com


  THERE are few things quite so Colombian as the sombrero vueltiao. The black and white hats, woven from dried cane leaves, and whose name can be loosely translated as “turned hat”, are worn proudly on the Caribbean coast by cowhands, professors, merchants, cumbia dancers, politicians and visiting dignitaries. Pride in the elaborately made hats drove politicians to declare them a national cultural symbol.The price of a hat depends on how many pairs of tightly braided strands of dried cane leaf are used to make it. For tourists in the shady plazas of Cartagena or the busy pre-Carnaval streets of Barranquilla, they can range anywhere from $20 to $100. Members of the Zenú indigenous group hand-dye, weave and shape them in a process that can take up to a month.Unless, of course, they are mass-produced in China. Chinese manufacturers can turn out a machine-made vueltiao hat of synthetic fibres in just a few minutes. In Colombian wholesale markets, they now go for about $1.50 a piece; on the street they fetch around $5.50.Carlos Bellido, who sells the original vueltiao hats outside the posh Santa Clara hotel in Cartagena’s colonial centre, says the Chinese knockoffs were flooding the market, and many people, especially tourists, opted for the cheaper version of the hats. “I have nothing against the Chinese,” he says, “[but] their hats fall apart. They get floppy and unravel.”Faced with the competition from China, Zenú artisans complained to local authorities, who sided with the craftsmen. On January 16th the Zenú sent out members of their Indian guard, armed with ceremonial staffs, to check the hats being sold in coastal cities and confiscate the knockoffs. The following day, authorities banned imports of the Chinese version, arguing that the hat enjoys a protected designation of origin. “Free trade in the 21st century has rules, Sergio Díaz-Granados, the trade minister, told indigenous leaders at a meeting this month to coordinate the government’s response. “It’s not the law of the strongest against the weakest.”The resolution said that a product is illegal if in addition to “reproducing, imitating, creating a likeness or evoking a protected [product, it] also tries to substitute it in the market.” A fine of up to $330,000 is to be imposed on anyone caught selling the prohibited hats, and police in major Caribbean cities were ordered to round up the knockoffs. On January 26th alone, agents seized 800 hats worth about $6,700 in stores and street stalls in Barranquilla.On a visit to Beijing in May 2012, Juan Manuel Santos, Colombia’s president, began discussions aimed at reaching a free-trade deal with China—the country’s second-biggest trade partner, trailing only the United States. The two countries declared that the first step is to define sensitive sectors that may be harmed by a trade deal. The sombrero vueltiao has shown some of the vulnerabilities even before a deal is done.]]>

   A blaze in a Brazilian nightclub kills at least 232  

H.J. | SÃO PAULO
http://www.economist.com


  THE death toll from a fire that broke out in the early hours of January 27th in a Brazilian nightclub has already reached 232, with more than 100 injured, many severely. Almost all the victims were young; the nightclub, Kiss, in the university town of Santa Maria in the far southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, was popular with students. Most of the deaths were from smoke inhalation and asphyxiation.Some survivors were flown to neighbouring cities, including the state capital, Porto Alegre, for treatment. A sports centre in Santa Maria was hastily turned into a makeshift morgue. It is customary in Brazil for burials to be held within 24 hours of death; the high death toll may mean mass funerals too.Questions are being asked about the quality of the nightclub building and whether emergency procedures were followed. The blaze appears to have been started by a pyrotechnic flare lit on stage by a member of the band; sound-proofing material caught fire, producing toxic gases which quickly overpowered many in the crowd. Police said that at least one exit was blocked. Television stations broadcast images of firefighters, helped by bystanders, breaking through a wall to get in. Some of the victims were found in the bathrooms, possibly because they mistook them for emergency exits, and were then unable to come back out through the panicked crowds.It was reported that the club’s Fire Prevention and Control Plan expired last year. This may not be significant: renewing business licences of any sort can be slow in Brazil, and businesses can usually continue to operate legally while waiting, provided they have submitted their request in time. But firefighters and police said they would be investigating whether exits had been locked illegally, whether the venue was overcrowded and whether its safety equipment was working. A fire extinguisher used to try to put out the blaze when it started appears to have been out of order.Brazilian bars typically provide a numbered ticket on entry, which is used to place orders during the night, with payment upon leaving. Investigators will also want to know whether bouncers initially impeded escape, assuming that people were simply trying to leave without paying.The scale of the tragedy, and the youth of the victims, have shocked Brazil. Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's president, cut short a visit to Chile, where she was attending a summit between European and Latin American countries, and flew directly to Santa Maria. Rio Grande do Sul is a relatively prosperous state, with good hospitals and health-care infrastructure, but she promised that the federal government would give any help required in the continued search for bodies and the treatment of those injured. "I want to say to the people of our country and the people of Santa Maria that in this moment of sadness, we are together," she said through tears before boarding her plane.]]>

   The Supreme Court orders the release of a French woman jailed for belonging to a kidnapping gang  

T.W. | MEXICO CITY
http://www.economist.com


  NEARLY seven years after she was imprisoned in Mexico on kidnapping charges, Florence Cassez, a French citizen, is to be freed. Ms Cassez, 38, was sentenced to 96 years in jail in 2006 for her supposed role in a kidnapping gang called the Zodiacs. (The sentence was later reduced to 60 years.) On January 23rd Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled that she should be released immediately, on the basis that the authorities had violated her legal rights. She is expected to fly back to France immediately.On December 9th, 2005, gripped television viewers watched live footage of a raid on a ranch just outside Mexico City. Armed agents of the now-defunct AFI, then Mexico’s equivalent of America’s Federal Bureau of Investigation, were shown creeping into the ranch and arresting Ms Cassez and her Mexican boyfriend, Israel Vallarta. Reporters invited along to the operation recorded her saying in limited Spanish: “I didn’t know, I didn’t know.”The apparent involvement of a European citizen in a kidnapping gang was big enough news. But the case was about to get stranger still. Two months later Genaro García Luna, then head of the AFI, admitted that the televised “raid” had been a sham. The real arrests had taken place on December 8th, and the filmed events had been a piece of theatre, mocked up “at the request of you lot”, the media, Mr García Luna said.Not surprisingly, the case became a cause célèbre in France. In 2011 Nicolas Sarkozy, then France’s president, tried to dedicate a “Year of Mexico” cultural event in France to Ms Cassez. Mexico responded by cancelling its participation in the event. Last year Mexico’s Supreme Court decided against releasing Ms Cassez, although four of its five justices agreed that there were irregularities in the case. That paved the way for the latest appeal.The Supreme Court’s change of heart coincides with a change of government in Mexico. Ms Cassez’s arrest and trial took place during the government of the National Action Party (PAN), under which Mr García Luna was later appointed public-security secretary. Last year the PAN was voted out of office, and the presidency passed to the Institutional Revolutionary Party.France is jubilant at the release of someone widely seen as a victim of Mexico’s incompetent, corrupt justice system. Her mother, Charlotte, described feeling an “explosion of joy”. Francois Hollande, the president, said: “Today we can say that between France and Mexico we have the best relations that can be established.”Many Mexicans are not so sure about the ruling. Ezequiel Elizalde, one of Ms Cassez’s alleged victims, described her release as an “injustice”. Isabel Miranda de Wallace, an anti-kidnapping activist with links to the PAN, said the ruling could “open the doors to impunity”. There is certainly plenty of that around. Wherever they stand on Ms Cassez's release, Mexicans must hope that the case has helped to shine a spotlight on the shoddy state of the country’s justice system.]]>

   Crime is trending down in one of Latin America's most violent countries  

T.W. | GUATEMALA CITY
http://www.economist.com


    MURDER is an everyday tragedy in Guatemala, one of the world’s most violent countries. With around 15 killings a day, most violent deaths merit only a couple of paragraphs in the papers. But the slaying last week of two girls, aged six and 11, has shocked the country and been widely reported outside Latin America. Police are still not sure what lies behind the killing of the two children, whose bodies were found on the outskirts of Guatemala City, or whether they are linked to the murders of two women in the capital on the same day.The widespread coverage of the story has detailed Guatemala’s long history of violence, much of it rooted in a brutal 36-year civil war which came to an end in 1996. Amnesty International has demanded an end to the “national scandal” of unsolved murders of women and girls in the country.Amid the gloom, it is worth pointing out some important context: appalling crimes such as this are becoming less common. In 2009 Guatemala saw 46.3 murders per 100,000 people, according to the UN. In 2010 the rate fell to 41.4, and in 2011 it dropped again, to 38.5. And last year it declined for a third consecutive year, to 34.2. This adds up to a reduction of more than a quarter in three years.What of the murders of women? They have been falling at about the same rate. According to Amnesty there were 695 murders of women in 2010, 631 in 2011 and 560 last year. It would be premature to call this a trend. But it also seems odd to say, as Amnesty does, that there has been “no let-up” in killings of women and girls. In fact, the numbers have dropped by a fifth in the past two years.The media has always been much better at covering bad news than good, from Guatemala to Britain. This is no bad thing: cases such as the dreadful killings last week deserve every column-inch that they are getting, as without this kind of pressure, the government would have less reason to make things better. But unglamorous good news is worth reporting too, not least so that voters know which policies are working. Beyond the horror of Guatemala’s latest killings is a more important story: outrages such as this are quietly becoming less common.]]>  


A maple mishap

   The Bank of Canada depicts a Norwegian maple on its new bank notes  

M.D. | OTTAWA
http://www.economist.com


    IN ITS ultimately unsuccessful bid to avoid controversy with a new series of bank notes, Canada’s central bank consulted with a wide range of experts. Physicists, chemists and engineers helped with the security features; operators of vending machines and armoured carriers weighed in on their use and transport; the central banks of England, Australia and Mexico shared their experiences with the issuance of new bills; and representatives of the blind and general public provided input on the design. The bank did leave out one critical constituency, however: botanists.Botanists might not know much about bank notes, but they do know which leaves belong on which trees. And it turns out that the maple leaf depicted in a prominent security feature on the new notes most closely resembles a Norwegian maple, rather than one of the country’s ten native species. The offending image escaped notice when new C$100 ($100) and C$50 bills were issued last year. But closer scrutiny awaited following the release of the new C$20 notes, which account half of all bills in circulation.In any other country this would not be much of a faux pas. In Canada, however, the maple tree is the country’s arboreal emblem. A red leaf is the centerpiece of the national flag and part of the closely regulated national wordmark. Maple syrup is the closest thing there is to a national condiment (and a theft from the strategic maple syrup reserve of the province of Quebec last year provoked widespread outrage). The central bank insists that it did consult an unnamed dendrologist—a specialist in wooded plants such as trees, shrubs and lianas—and that the stylised leaf is meant to represent all maples. But botanists, including one who consults with the Royal Mint on coinage, have been coming forward to say that the leaf with five main lobes on the notes is definitely from the Norway maple, an invasive species brought to North America in the 18th century which turns yellow in the autumn, and definitely not the iconic sugar maple leaf, which has three main lobes and turns a brilliant scarlet.The Bank of Canada is somewhat unfairly carrying the can for the “Banknote Bungle”, as one headline described it. The design was produced by the Canadian Bank Note Company and approved by the Ministry of Finance, but representatives of both have been keeping their heads down. The central bank has already weathered several minor controversies over the same series, including its decision to replace the image of an Asian woman peering into a microscope with a white woman, following complaints from participants in a focus group (Asian groups objected). Comments from the focus groups make you wonder about the participants. Some thought a depiction of DNA was a sex toy; others perceived a skull and crossbones in the porthole of an icebreaker. The use of polymer-based paper instead of the traditional cotton for the notes also attracted criticism, either because the bills felt unfamiliar—more like Monopoly money, according to one focus-group participant—or because they were not accepted by some vending machines. So too did the purchase of the polymer from a company from Australia, which raised nationalist heckles.But the central bank is unlikely to abandon the use of polymer, because it allows printers to embed sophisticated security devices in the bills, rather than placing them on top of cotton-based paper. According to a member of the bank’s currency department, “The key objective in any new note series is to support confidence in bank notes by staying ahead of counterfeiters, and the new notes contain leading-edge security features that make them among the most advanced in the world.” The bank’s long-standing emphasis on security might explain why botanical correctness was overlooked. Polymer notes are also expected to last for 7.5 years, compared with just three for cotton-based bills.The C$10 and C$5 notes in the new polymer-based series are still to be released, giving the bank an opportunity to correct the error. It can do nothing, however, about the C$50 note issued last year, which is in the running for the 2012 Bank Note of the Year award given by the International Bank Note Society. Canada last won in 2004 with a C$20 bill. Banknotes must have artistic merit and/or innovative security features, according to the society’s website. Judging from past winners, security seems to triumph over good design. So the Canadian $50, which is loaded with security features, might still have a shot despite its questionable botany.]]>

   Argentina grounds its presidential plane to keep it from the holdouts' clutches  

H.C. | BUENOS AIRES
http://www.economist.com


  THE Argentine government was caught completely off-guard last October when authorities from the Ghanaian port of Tema seized the Libertad, a frigate used for training naval cadets. The country had already spent years sparring in the courts with investors who own bonds on which it defaulted in 2001. But its officials never anticipated that one New York-based hedge fund would manage to secure an order from a Ghanaian judge to hold the vessel in port because of Argentina’s failure to pay its debts.After months of legal wrangling, the country wriggled out of its creditors’ grasp when the UN’s Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ordered that the ship be released, on the grounds that military vessels are immune from impoundment. Cristina Fernández, the president, tried to save face by celebrating the Libertad’s return on January 9th as a national triumph. As propeller planes looped between the ship’s masts and flares lit up the sea, Ms Fernández welcomed the crew home with a 25-minute speech touting Argentina’s sovereignty and resilience.Now that the government has learned just how far its litigious creditors can reach, however, it is taking no chances. Ever since the Libertad was detained, the country’s presidential plane, Tango 01, has been conspicuously idle. Shortly after the seizure in Ghana, Argentina spent $2m of taxpayer money to hire a Dassault Falcon 900, a corporate jet, for three months. After that rental expired, Argentina shelled out another $880,000 to acquire the services of a Bombardier Global Express 7000 to ferry the president on her current trip to Cuba, the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam and Indonesia. Overall, Ms Fernández logged just 684 hours of flight time on her own Boeing 757 last year, a sharp drop from the 1,066 she flew on Tango 01 in 2011. (The government has not released data on how much of that gap accumulated during the last three months of 2012, when the Libertad was in Ghana.)The government insists that it has had to resort to additional aviation contracts only because of technical problems with the president’s fleet. However, a recent note written by Óscar Parrilli, Ms Fernández’s own general secretary, suggests otherwise. He said that the president’s legal counsel had warned him not to use Tango 01, because of the “aggressive posture of the vulture funds with Argentina.” Various creditors have tried to get American courts to order the seizure of the plane during its previous trips to the United States, though none have succeeded so far.Moreover, the government may have inadvertently created another legal headache for itself in its effort to dodge the “vultures” seeking payment on their bonds. The charter company from which Argentina chose to rent the Global Express 7000 was Chapman Freeborn, a British firm. Among the company’s other clients is Britain’s Ministry of Defence, which happens to use its planes for transport to the Falkland Islands—a British-controlled territory in the South Atlantic Ocean that Argentina tried to conquer by force in 1982 and still claims today. Chapman Freeborn also leases aircraft to three companies involved with oil exploration around the islands. Just last year Ms Fernández got a law passed preventing the Argentine public sector from buying services from people or firms “who in a direct or indirect way” participate in the Falklands’ nascent petroleum industry. Julio Martínez, an opposition congressman, says he is researching the issue in the hopes of greeting the president with a lawsuit when she returns home from her trip.]]>

   The Chilean government's long-simmering conflict with displaced indigenous groups heats up  

G.L. | SANTIAGO
http://www.economist.com


  JANUARY is often a fraught month in the Araucanía, the lush, green region of southern Chile which for centuries has been home to the Mapuches, the country’s largest indigenous minority. In the first month of 2008 a young Mapuche man, Matías Catrileo, was shot dead by police while trespassing on private land he claimed had historically belonged to his ancestors. He has become something of a martyr for indigenous rights activists. Four years later, seven firefighters died while trying to extinguish a forest fire. The government said the blaze was started deliberately, possibly by the Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco, a radical group dedicated to taking back what they regard as traditional Mapuche lands.This New Year has proved just as difficult. In the early hours of January 4th, a group of around 20 masked attackers surrounded the rural home of Werner Luchsinger, a well-known landowner and farmer, and set it alight. Mr Luchsinger, 74, and his wife were burned alive. It is highly likely that he was targeted for revenge. It was on Mr Luchsinger’s land that Catrileo was killed, and the Luchsingers, whose ancestors moved to the region from Switzerland in the 19th century, have a long history of troubled relations with their Mapuche neighbours.Sebastián Piñera, the president, responded to the latest outbreak of violence by clearing his diary to visit the Araucanía. He said his government would set up an anti-terrorism unit in the region and draft more police officers. Such incremental measures might help a bit. But they are unlikely to bring an end to the conflict, which dates from the late 19th century, when the Chilean state finally tamed the Araucanía—something Spanish colonists had failed to do in over 200 years—rounded up the Mapuches, and sold off their land to mostly European settlers.Successive Chilean governments have failed to devise a comprehensive policy to resolve the Araucanía’s problems. Over the past decade, they have focused on land redistribution. The state has bought land from forestry companies and farmers and returned it to Mapuche families.But the process is fraught with obstacles. The Mapuches often cannot prove the land in question once belonged to their ancestors. The programme has been only partially successful. Critics of the policy say it has tended to reward the most strident Mapuches, particularly those who advocate violence, at the expense of others with equally valid claims. At times land has been granted to groups who lack the wherewithal to farm it productively.Frustrated by what they perceive as a lack of progress, Mapuche activists have resorted to impromptu land seizures. They often stray onto disputed farmland and occupy it for hours, sometimes days, until the police drive them off. Some of these protests end peacefully, but others, like the one that claimed Catrileo’s life, turn violent.Meanwhile, the conflict has intensified of late. Libertad y Desarrollo, a think tank, estimates there were 177 violent incidents related to indigenous-rights claims in the Araucanía in 2012. That makes last year one of the most violent in the region in over a decade. The local economy is feeling the consequences. According to a recent study, the Araucanía is the poorest of Chile’s 15 regions, with an income per head of little over $5,000, less than a third of the national average. The poverty rate there is 23%, well above the national average of 14%. Foreign investment has largely dried up.The region’s problems seem all but intractable, and Mr Piñera, a conservative with a business background, has been neither more nor less successful in tackling it than his centre-left predecessors. Some Mapuches have called for political autonomy, citing the example of Spain’s regions. But unlike the Basques or Catalans, the Mapuches are a minority even within their own region. The majority of Araucanians regard themselves as Chilean.Violence in the Araucanía has a tendency to dissipate just as suddenly as it flares, and the region may well return to relative calm within a few weeks. But the underlying conflict between the Chilean state and the country’s original inhabitants will rumble on for far longer.Editor’s note: Because of a technical error, a different version of this blog post was posted on January 10th.]]>

   Come January 10th, will Venezuela know who its president is?  

P.G. | CARACAS
http://www.economist.com


    ON JANUARY 10th a host of foreign dignitaries will gather in Caracas, including the presidents of Bolivia and Uruguay. They had intended to witness Hugo Chávez being sworn in for his third term as Venezuela’s president. But Mr Chávez himself is conspicuously absent from the list of dignitaries expected to attend. Although he regularly reassured voters during his successful re-election campaign last year that he had been completely cured of cancer, he is currently in intensive care in Cuba, following his fourth surgery in 18 months. On January 8th the government announced that he is too ill to attend. Instead of an inauguration, a rally will be held outside the presidential palace in “solidarity” with the ailing leader.Mr Chávez’s no-show will put Venezuela in a constitutional quandary. In periods when the president is temporarily unable to perform his duties, an interim president is supposed to replace him; if he dies or is permanently incapacitated, the constitution requires a new presidential election to be held within 30 days. The opposition argues that Diosdado Cabello, the speaker of the legislature and the country’s highest-ranking elected official, is legally required to stand in for now. (Last month Mr Chávez named Nicolás Maduro, his vice-president, as his successor, but he is an appointed official, not an elected one, and his appointment expires with the presidential term in which he was named.) Mr Chávez’s opponents are also calling for the supreme court to appoint a medical board to travel to Havana and determine when—or if—he will be fit to take office again.However, Mr Cabello, Mr Maduro and the judges on the supreme court are all chavistas, and appearing to undermine Mr Chávez would be highly politically risky for them, as long as there is a chance he will return. On January 9th the constitutional branch of the supreme court ruled that his extended, indefinite stay in Cuba does not constitute a presidential absence, either temporary or permanent. The president of the court, Luisa Estella Morales, said that Mr Chávez himself would have to sign a decree announcing his absence in order to invoke the relevant constitutional clauses. (Mr Chávez did not even write the letter to parliament requesting that his inauguration be delayed, suggesting he is not fit enough to sign his name.) Ms Morales also dismissed the constitutional provision for a medical board as inapplicable.That will put Venezuelan politics in limbo until the president’s status is resolved. Mr Chávez’s officials and the courts say there is no pressing need for a re-elected president to be sworn in, since his incumbent status provides “administrative continuity”. On these grounds, the cabinet can remain in place as well, even though its members were appointed for the 2007-2013 term. Even so, without an interim president, it is unclear who will run the country in practice in the meantime, or under what authority. The opposition says that Mr Chávez’s underlings will be “usurping” executive power. The president’s adversaries have announced they will take their case to the Organisation of American States, but it is unlikely that foreign governments will want to get involved.No one knows how long it will be before there is news from Havana. The president has never released a medical bulletin since his cancer was first diagnosed in June 2011. Neither the type of cancer nor its precise location have been revealed, although the government has announced that he is now fighting a “severe” respiratory infection. Nothing has been heard from Mr Chávez himself since he left a month ago. The president who so successfully made the personal political in Venezuela has now left his country in a state of suspended animation.]]>

   Will Brazil's second try at a new drunk-driving law make a difference?  

H.J. and N.S. | SÃO PAULO
http://www.economist.com


    IN BRAZIL, locals say, some laws “stick” while others don’t. The first sort leads to real penalties for transgression, and hopefully changes behaviour. The second looks good on paper, but changes nothing. Each time an important new law passes, Brazilians ask themselves which sort this one will turn out to be.The latest guessing game concerns changes to a drunk-driving law passed in 2008. That set the maximum permissible blood-alcohol level at 60mg/100ml, and raised penalties too. At first it looked like a great success: road deaths fell by a fifth. But then canny drivers spotted a loophole. When stopped and asked for a breathalyzer test, they could simply refuse, stating their constitutional right not to incriminate themselves, and avoid criminal sanctions. The number of deaths on the roads rose again.The newly amended version, which came into force on December 21st, allows police to use evidence such as photographs, videos and witness statements to argue before a judge that a driver is suffering from “psychomotor function altered by the influence of alcohol or another addictive substance”. That means that blood-alcohol level is just one of the ways inebriation can be demonstrated, making refusing a breathalyzer test less worthwhile. Indeed, someone who was driving badly but had not been drinking might calculate that the best way to prove he was not under the influence would be to do the test.Federal traffic police are trumpeting victory in round two of the fight against drunk driving. Figures released on January 2nd showed that they had charged 700 motorists with drunk driving, either for failing a breathalyzer test or for refusing one and displaying some other sign of drunkenness. Deaths in transit over the new-year break fell by 12% in comparison with the previous year. But some worry that the new law requires police officers and courts to exercise enough subjective judgment that it will still allow too much wiggle room. “I'm waiting to see how this highly subjective way of defining proof of inebriation works out in practice,” says Ricardo Ferraço, a senator. In other words, whether the law “sticks”.]]>

   The problem with the claim that Britain orchestrated the War of the Triple Alliance  

D.R. | NEW YORK
http://www.economist.com


    AS THE author of our Christmas special on the War of the Triple Alliance, a conflict that raged from 1865-70 between Paraguay and a coalition of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, I’ve paid close attention to the burgeoning comment thread regarding the piece. One theme in particular leaps out: the criticism that the article misrepresented history by ignoring the role of Britain in the war. Of the 107 people who have waded into the forum so far, no fewer than 15 different participants have independently claimed, to greater or lesser degrees, that British interests (be it the government or companies based there) orchestrated the conflict to undermine Paraguay’s independent industrialisation and secure profits for its financiers and exporters. This interpretation—derived from the dependency theory school of foreign relations (which holds that the West became rich by exploiting underdeveloped countries) and advanced by leftist authors such as Uruguay’s Eduardo Galeano, Argentina’s León Pomer and Brazil’s Júlio José Chiavenato—has been widely taught in Latin America for decades.I neglected to mention this argument not because I hadn’t come across it, or because I was writing for a British publication eager to obscure the country’s rapacious imperialist past. Instead, I omitted it because unlike so many criticisms of the old colonial empires, this one happens to be completely ahistorical. During my reporting in the field and conversations with numerous leading academic experts on the war, I did not come across a shred of evidence that the British government or British businesses intervened in any way, at any point, to encourage or prolong the fighting.To be sure, the Brazilian government borrowed some money from British banks and bought some British guns (among other sources) in the late 1860s. However, countless other countries that had nothing do with the war did so as well, in far greater quantities. The Argentine military effort was largely financed domestically. Similarly, although Paraguay certainly maintained protectionist-mercantilist economic policies before the war, Mr Galeano’s assertion that those restrictions kept out British traders is fiction: British merchants were extremely active in prewar Paraguay, and one of their biggest clients was the government of Carlos Antonio and Francisco Solano López itself. In fact, Paraguay would probably have been vanquished far sooner than it was were it not for the yeoman work of George Thompson, a British engineer who enlisted in its army and organised the construction of its trenches and fortifications. Those structures were essential in the country’s ability to hold out for years despite inferior troops and equipment. Thompson later wrote a book about his experience that has become one of the leading primary sources about the conflict.It is, of course, entirely possible that contemporary researchers have overlooked something. If any of the commenters who allege that the British government or British companies somehow fomented the war can point me to any original documents from the time to support this thesis, I will be more than happy to revise my position. Barring that, however, I think it’s best if we leave history to the historians, not the dependency theorists.]]>

   The president sets her sights on judicial independence  

H.C. | BUENOS AIRES
http://www.economist.com


    The holidays seem to inspire belligerence instead of cheer in Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina’s president. She has spent most of the southern-hemisphere spring battling with her country’s foreign creditors, media companies and trade unions. Now, in a worrying sign for the health of Argentina’s democratic institutions, she has picked a fight with the judiciary as well.The independence of Argentina’s courts has always been precarious. During the 1990s Carlos Menem, then the president, expanded the Supreme Court from five members to nine and packed it with unqualified yes men, making a laughingstock out of the country’s highest tribunal.The damage to the institution’s credibility was largely repaired by Néstor Kirchner, who took office a year after Argentina’s 2001-02 economic collapse. He defied his Peronist party’s tradition of trampling on the judiciary by appointing a series of highly respected judges, and bringing the high court back down to its original size. Ms Fernández, his wife, was then a senator and pushed those reforms through the legislature.However, Kirchner’s handling of the lower courts was far less noble. In 2006 he changed the composition of the council that nominates judges in order to give the executive a veto. Overall, the Argentine courts are still in dire straits: a recent report published by the World Economic Forum ranked it 133rd of 144 countries in judicial independence, and below all other Latin American countries except Paraguay, Nicaragua and Venezuela.In 2007 Ms Fernández ran to succeed her husband, and won easily. He died in 2010, and the following year she was re-elected with 54% of the vote. In both campaigns, she promised to bolster Argentina’s fragile democratic institutions. However, her appreciation for judicial independence seems to have vanished now that the courts have begun ruling against her.The president’s primary beef with the judiciary involves the courts’ handling of her conflict with Grupo Clarín, Argentina’s biggest media conglomerate. In 2009 Congress passed a law that would force the company, whose reporters have been sharply critical of the government, to divest the vast majority of its television and radio stations within a year. Clarín immediately secured an injunction preventing the implementation of this provision for three years, to allow time for the company’s challenge to the law’s constitutionality to be heard.Ms Fernández did everything within her power to run out the clock on the injunction. That would allow the law to take effect and force Clarín to sell its assets before a judge could rule that the requirement was unconstitutional. In the two months before it was set to expire on December 7th, the government requested the recusal of nearly all the judges involved with the case, on the grounds that they had compromising ties to Clarín—ranging from attending conferences organized by the company’s subsidiaries to having previously ruled in favour of its affiliates. Meanwhile, in the court of public opinion, the president’s spokesmen regularly touted the deadline as a death knell for the country’s hegemonic media “monopoly”.The judiciary, however, would not be cowed. On December 4th, the court in charge of the case rejected the two of the recusal requests. Two days later, a group of judges’ associations published a harshly worded press release warning that the “excessive use of recusals” was a threat to the courts’ constitutionally guaranteed autonomy, and “as a consequence, to all citizens of the nation.” On the eve of the deadline, the tribunal issued another injunction, which extended the stay until a final decision on the constitutionality of the media law is taken.Once the new injunction had stymied the government’s strategy of delay, the president reversed direction overnight, and began pushing for a quick ruling on the constitutionality of othe law. Making use of a new power recently approved by Congress, the executive asked the Supreme Court to bypass the lower tribunals and rule on the law as soon as possible, owing to its “institutional gravity”. On December 10th, the high court rejected the request.This show of judicial independence has enraged Ms Fernández. She first dispatched Martín Sabbatella, whom she designated to oversee the implementation of the media law, to call the new injunction “shameful” and claim the judiciary was “not prepared to fight with the corporations, because a large part of it is colonized by those same corporations.” Later on, following a controversial ruling that freed 13 suspects in a high-profile case of human trafficking, the president lashed out at the courts herself, accusing the judges of corruption. “I don’t have proof,” she admitted, “but I have no doubt that when there is money involved, no matter what you do, they don’t care.” She also called for a nebulous “democratisation” of the judiciary. That could simply refer to the implementation of an already-approved jury system. But it could also be shorthand for choosing judges by popular vote—a reform that would require amending the constitution, which Ms Fernández would have to do anyway if she wants to run for a third term in 2015.Perhaps the most succinct summary of the government’s position was provided on December 17th by Juan Manuel Abal Medina, the cabinet chief, who called the tribunal handling the Clarín case a “shit chamber”. The risk is that such attacks on the prestige of the judiciary will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.]]>

   Hugo Chávez names his successor  

P.G. | CARACAS
http://www.economist.com


  IN HIS 14 years as Venezuela’s president, Hugo Chávez has always subscribed to the principle of après moi, le deluge. Wary of allowing any rival centre of power to emerge, he has systematically hollowed out the country’s institutions, and subtly encouraged factions within his movement to spar for his good graces. But on December 8th, Mr Chávez announced that his still-unspecified pelvic cancer has reappeared, and that he must undergo a fourth surgery. With no guarantee that he will be in suitable condition for his inauguration for a third term on January 10th, he at last anointed an heir apparent, choosing Nicolás Maduro (pictured), his foreign minister and vice-president.Under Venezuela’s 1999 constitution, if the president dies or leaves office during the final two years of a six-year term, the appointed vice-president serves out the remainder. But before that point, if a president has to abdicate, new elections must be held within 30 days. So if Mr Chávez cannot be sworn in, the country will hold a re-run of the vote held on October 7th, when the incumbent beat Henrique Capriles of the Democratic Unity (MUD) alliance by a surprisingly comfortable margin. Assuming that Mr Capriles, currently the governor of Miranda state, is re-elected to his post in regional elections on December 16th, he would almost certainly be the opposition candidate once again, and would face Mr Maduro in Mr Chávez’s stead.Mr Maduro, 50, has never held an elected executive post. A former student leader and member of the radical Socialist League, his only job outside politics was as a bus driver starting in the late 1980s. That gave him a toehold in organised labour, and he became president of the Caracas Metro union. His links with the president go back to the days when Mr Chávez was in jail after a failed coup attempt, and he joined the legislature in 1999, chairing the assembly in 2005-06.Like most of Mr Chávez’s inner circle, he has no significant political base of his own. But he has been more successful than anyone in convincing the president of his loyalty and ability to carry out orders. Mr Maduro has never been far from Mr Chávez’s side during the president’s frequent visits to Cuba for cancer treatment. He is widely considered to have the support of the Cuban regime, whose security and intelligence services play an important (though largely hidden) role in Venezuela.Mr Maduro would have to triumph over two rivals if he hopes to take over the chavista apparatus. The first is Mr Capriles, who won a respectable 46% of the vote in October, and showed impressive skills as a campaigner. Polls have consistently shown Mr Capriles beating all opponents save Mr Chávez himself, including Mr Maduro. However, the president’s whole-hearted endorsement of Mr Maduro would surely cause many of his supporters to back his preferred successor, especially if an incapacitated Mr Chávez remained alive to remind voters of his dying wish. “My firm opinion,” he said on December 9th, “clear as the full moon, irreversible, absolute, and total, is that in a scenario requiring the holding of new presidential elections, you should choose Nicolás Maduro as president.”Even if Mr Maduro did vanquish Mr Capriles, however, he would still have to exert control over Mr Chávez’s fractious movement. His main challenger would be Diosdado Cabello, a former army lieutenant who participated in Mr Chávez’s coup attempt, and is now the chairman of the legislature and the vice-president of the ruling United Socialist Party. Mr Cabello lacks Mr Maduro’s bona fides as an ideological leftist. However, he wields influence in the army and the highly opaque distribution of the country’s oil revenues, and despite the president’s wishes, he may not line up meekly behind Mr Maduro. Despite Mr Chávez’s belated effort to arrange for continuity, some degree of internecine warfare seems inevitable.]]>

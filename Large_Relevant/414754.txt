Kudos to the uploader for posting this video. It has tremendous value as a learning tool. I firmly believe that if more kids were required to see real photographs from a drunk driving or text-driving﻿ accident, countless lives could be saved. Instead of SEEING the actual consequences, we are given statistics and sanitized descriptions such as "seriously injured" or "fatality" and people continue under the delusion that "The Kardashians" or "Basketball Wives" represent reality.

Tell it to the people in charge of what we see on TV regarding war, plane crashes, etc. Until we see the real horrors, we'll never be prepared mentally for life's realities. And the Kardashians actually are a great example of what NOT to become, so they should be watched﻿ by parents and children alike.

What's craziest about watching this video is to realize just how FAST everything escalates. One minute you're having a blast, and literally the next minute flames﻿ are engulfing the room and everyone is in a mad panic.

The bouncer was not﻿ afraid for anyone. He was probably a sociopath, and a bully judging by his actions in the hospital, and when he was summoned to testify.

Considering that the pileup soon happened there was possibly a rapid deterioration inside though the investigations showed that this happened about 10-20 seconds later. Also there was flaming materials dropping on people inside at the﻿ time setting them on fire.

Again, I wonder if he was afraid that too many people trying to use that door would deny it to very important personages and also﻿ to himself particularly as the fire started nearby and there was a danger that the way would quickly become impassible and it did, though he surely knew of the secret kitchen exit also. At any rate, people died and others were horribly burned because of that bouncer's decision.

At 1:40 past ignition the entire place was instant death except﻿ for the front doorway and most of the bar to the left of the front entrance from where you see people coming out...

Based on the stories out there from people there, at least 17 people survived the doorway crush and 31 bodies were found there. That's an amazing job of rescuing when you consider that they had less﻿ than four minutes to do it. At 1 minute 40 seconds after ignition most of the building became a place where instant death happened if you were caught there. Considering that, they did a remarkable job.

One thing that strikes me about this is not just the obvious overwhelming horror of it all, but the amount of open﻿ heroism from ordinary people that went on. You watch those people trying to pull victims out the windows and out of the pile at the front door while getting their faces right in the smoke and no doubt seeing and hearing things straight out of hell, yet they kept trying to save people when I dare say most others would have understandibly fled. RIP, and my prayers for the survivors.

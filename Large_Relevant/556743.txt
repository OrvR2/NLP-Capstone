NFPA President Jim Shannon talks about the importance of sprinklers in the aftermath of Brazil nightclub fire


Reflecting on the tragic nightclub fire in Brazil earlier this week that claimed the lives of more than 230 individuals when a flare ignited soundproofing on the ceiling, NFPA President Jim Shannon talked about the need  to have sprinklers in all public assembly occupancies. Shannon called the Brazil scenario heartbreaking saying that what makes it heartbreaking is that it can be avoided with adherence to codes including the use of sprinklers.
 

Shannon also talked about the ways patrons can play a role in their own safety by being aware of their surroundings -- knowing where the exits are, checking for sprinklers and smoke alarms.

NFPA 13 now open for public input


NFPA 13, The Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems, along with the other sprinkler installation standards, NFPA 13R, NFPA 13 D, NFPA 24, and NFPA 291 are currently open for public input. Public input is the term now used at NFPA to address a code change proposal to a technical document.   
Submitting public input can be done in three easy steps. 
1)Log in to the document information page of the standar d you would like to submit public input too. (for NFPA 13 use www.nfpa.org/13).
2)Find the code section you would like to modify and enter your changes in the text editor.
3)Provide a substantiation for your proposed change to the standard and click submit. 
Once you have completed those three steps your proposed change will be sent to the  technical committee responsible for the section of the standard you would like to change. Your public input will be reviewed and acted upon at the First Draft meeting this summer.
It is important to remember that NFPA 13 and its associated  documents have a modified public input closing date of May 31. That means that all changes proposed changes to NFPA 13 and the other sprinkler design and installation standards must be submitted online through the new online submission process by that date. 
We look forward to reviewing your proposed changes and look forward to another exciting cycle for the NFPA 13 committees.

New York Times editorial examines Wal-Mart's new stance on fire safety

A recent story in NFPA Journal underscored a record-setting 
factory fire in Bangladesh that killed more than 100 workers. The 
November blaze has prompted Wal-Mart, which purchases more than $1 
billion in garments from this country annually, according to The New York Times, to adopt a "zero-tolerance" policy for sub-par safety standards at factories where the company purchases its clothes.
But does this new policy do enough to protect workers? In a recent editorial, the Times states that Wal-Mart will now implement periodic safety audits at factories and will "cut them off" if plants are not adhering to safety protocols, which include keeping exits unobstructed and conducting safety training. "Wal-Mart needs to do much more," states the editorial. "It should require fireproof exits and external fire escapes, which are the most effective way to get people out of a burning building safely. What's [also] needed is an independent and robust inspection system that is legally enforceable and run by safety professionals."
Read the rest of the editorial, and voice your own opinions in the comments section below. We'd love to hear them.

NFPA and ESPN’s Hannah Storm warn Super Bowl grillers to play it safe




The Super Bowl is inching nearer, and a lot of eager cooks
will start firing up their grills in preparation. However, there are dangers
involved with grilling that are often unaccounted for. The NFPA has
collaborated with ESPN SportsCenter anchor Hannah Storm to release a series of
PSAs on those risks.
This past December, Storm was cooking dinner for her kids
when the wind blew out the flame on her open grill. She turned to the gas and
prepared to re-light it. Unbeknownst to her, propane gas had been on top of the
grill, and it erupted into a fireball. She sustained first- and second-degree
burns, and only returned to television on January 1st after
extensive healing.
This PSA encourages responsible grilling practices, especially this weekend for the Super Bowl, and
reminds the public to turn off the gas and wait for at least 15 minutes before
attempting to re-ignite a grill that has gone out. A few moments of caution
could save cooks and their families from burns and trauma.
Please check out our grilling safety tips at www.nfpa.org/Hannah.

Fire protection engineer offers his take on Brazil nightclub fire



Jaime A. Moncada, director of International Fire Safety Consulting and the international fire safety training/NFPA joint venture director for Latin America, recently offered his opinions on the Brazil nightclub fire in an Associated Press (AP) article. 
After examining a blueprint of Kiss nightclub, where more than 230 people died from the fire on January 27, Moncada told the AP that the building's one and only exit was permissable under law. He also noted that the club, if operating in the U.S., would have also failed inspection due to failure to treat the toxic foam soundproofing with a fire retardent and a lack of sprinklers. 
Moncada told NFPA Journal in a recent feature story on a deadly prison fire in Honduras that increased adoption of NFPA's codes and standards in Latin America should be considered to prevent future tragedies from occurring. 
"Adoption of NFPA codes and standards...coupled with readily available training seminars and a local fire safety industry well-versed in NFPA requirements can provide the start to a solution that may be impossible for local authorities to ignore," he states in Journal. "The only way to address the root causes of this horrific trend, which includes fires in...nightclubs...is through clear, cost-effective fire codes, coupled with effective enforcement. Only then can we turn the corner."

Why do tragic nightclub fires keep occuring?


				News reports say at least 231 people are now confirmed dead in the tragic nightclub fire in Santa Maria, Brazil that occurred early Sunday morning. CNN reports that 83 more people are hospitalized suffering from severe burns and smoke inhalation. CNN reports that police have arrested four people: one of the members of the band that was playing at the nightclub, the show producer and the club's two owners. Police have also questioned others to gain deeper insight into how the fire began and why it killed so many, according to CNN.
NFPA's Robert Solomon, division manager of Building & Life Safety Codes, was asked if he was surprised that a fire of this magnitude - and one so eerily similar to The Station nightclub fire that occurred in Rhode Island ten years ago - can still happen in this day and age.

Learn more about fire safety at nightclub and other public assembly venues.

At GOP Debate, Rick Perry Can’t Remember Third Agency He Would End As President

Rick Perry has become famous for his poor debate performances, which contributed largely to his fall from the top of the GOP polls, but he has topped himself tonight. With a good head of steam going answering a question from Caterpillar CEO Douglas R. Oberhelman, Perry ground to a halt as he tried to explain the three government agencies he would eliminate. “Let me tell you, it’s three agencies that are gone when I get there. Commerce, Education, and the um, what’s the third one there?”
Mitt Romney tried to help, offering “EPA?”
That wasn’t it, according to Perry. Given another chance to list them by moderator John Harwood, Perry tried again.
“The third agency I would do away with…the…ahh…Education…ahh…Commerce, and, let’s see,” looking down at his podium, “I can’t, the third one. I can’t. Sorry. Oops.”
A few minutes later, Perry did recall the lucky third agency: The Department of Energy. Yeah, how’s the Governor of Texas supposed to remember that one?
It was painful to watch. Maybe Perry ought to consult with Sarah Palin before the next debate, if he’s still in the race after this.
Here’s the clip, from CNBC: (Update below video)


Update:  According to CNN Political Reporter Peter Hamby:

I’d be more interested in hearing him be asked what functions each agency actually performs. 
We already know he’s mostly an idiot who only recites prepared talking points. 
It’s now time to delve into the depths of that idiocy until it ends his (and Cain’s, and Bachmann’s) campaign.

LOL – I love this show.

It looks bad, but I’ve had specifics slip my mind before as well (though I was never running for President…). Still, I don’t think this is a substantial mistake. Perry should have just joked, “There are so many darn federal agencies I can’t even remember them all. I’ll review my notes and answer the question on my web page at niggerheadranch2012.com, er, I mean, er, barackobama.com. Er, damnit! What’s my www address? Why does the liberal media keep hitting me and my brother Herman with these gotcha questions? Just use the google and I’ll answer your question.”

Hey Perry, Department of Energy, you know the one.
The department that was created to lessen the reliance on foreign energy and we have only become more reliant on foreign sources.
You know the one, the one that gave CRONY LOANS to Obama’s buddies at Solyndra. You remember the company, the one that gave money for Obama’s re election campaign.
Yep, Perry has brain freeze I believe, he is not good at recalling data at a moments notice.
I am sure all the brainiacs here at Mediaite could not beat him in a debate on the their own jobs, if they had a job. But you need to be fast on your feet to debate.
By the way, Cain rocked and you lefties attacking him may have only made him better up on the stage.

Jacobjakeu



Not at all. I don’t care for Perry. But the fact that on stage something escapes his mind is barely worth a mention, let alone an entire article.
If there’s an astute, insightful analysis of some bigger issue pertaining to Perry that will make people think, then by all means, go for it.
The point is, this isn’t the type of article you’d see from other writers on this staff. There are plenty of slip-ups and mix-ups that happen on stage. Democrat or Republican, you can write plenty of these articles… and they’d be a waste of time. Adding insight, however, might not be.
With Tommy, you can say “here’s the subject” and “here’s Tommy writing it” and you needn’t say anything more. You can predict what he’d say. That’s not the characteristic of a good or insightful writer.






Crackidy



The headline was pretty straight forward towards a story that is crackling throughout media right now.  Defending Perry’s performance tonight is akin to defending Weiner’s weiner pics.
Christopher gets paid to write with a politically left slant doesn’t deny not having.  Getting paid to write your opinion sure sounds like “a life” to me.  If you don’t like what he writes, the best revenge is not to read it or comment on it.  Less clicks ultimately means less money.

I’ve been saying for more than a year here that Romney will be the Republican nominee.  You can take this to the bank, and smart folks saw this coming long ago — when Mediaite was still fantasizing about a Trump candidacy.  
So go ahead, my liberal friends, laugh at Rick Perry — and Herman Cain too — but the last laugh is on you.  Democrats are now faced with a head-to-head matchup against the one Republican who doesn’t commit gaffes and can out-debate Obama, a stiff fellow who looks very lackluster when doesn’t have a teleprompter feeding him canned lines.

Even ‘baggers can’t stomach Romney as their nominee, but they’ll suck it up (as the ‘baggers are sooooooo good at doing!

And it doesn’t take a genius to see that Romney would be the likely winner, given that his poll numbers have been consistently near the top for ages…but kudos to you for deciphering poll numbers.  Must have been absolutely EXHAUSTING for a nitwit like you.

I’ve been saying the same thing all along about Romney. Like it or not, the GOP is stuck with him as their nominee. But if you don’t think that the antics of Cain, Bachmann, Gingrich and Perry aren’t going to affect his general election campaign, you’re deluded. The teabillies are going to drag him to the far right and probably stick him with one of those goons as VP as the price of acceptance. 
Or — the nightmare scenario — one of them is going to launch a third party candidacy, which will REALLY destroy Mittens.

A third party?

That’s uncalled for. There’s no need to insult Stockdale by comparing him to Perry.

Yeah, I know. It’s easy to find an idiot there but when I moved to New England many years ago I was able to convince people of the most ridiculous things (for example, I rode a horse to town and had no electricity) about Texas because many assumed the entire state was full of bucktoothed morons. Austin, Denton, Houston and some other towns are great places to live though, and full of educated people. 
The guy from Texas who posts here is a real brainiac.

Go look back at the more than 100 articles Mediaite ran on Trump earlier in the year.  You will see that I posted countless comments dismissing Trump as not a serious candidate — and I got attacked again and again by liberals.  Always by liberals.  Every time by liberals.  Repeatedly by liberals.  This happened hundreds of times.  And it’s all a matter of record on this very web site.
If you want to make up stuff, try coming up with something that can’t be so easily disproved.

Not so sorry to see Perry implode. One of the few Obama could beat in a one on one debate.
It was interesting to see some polling the network did at some college. Romney went from 25% to 40% and Gingrich went from single digits to 25%. Out of the 250 students 49% were registered Republicans. This bodes well for a Republican candidate in 2012.

I disagree on Romney beating Obama, and before you get too excited remember that Romney is, pretty much, Obama lite, or perhaps Obama is Romney lite, it is hard to tell.
By the way, why has no one mentioned Ron Paul, I thought he had trolls on every possible news/blog site to ensure he never escaped unmentioned.

I notice that a lot of my fellow Conservatives are not responding to this post but I know why and that is probably because we are fed up and tired of Tommy Christopher spreading his prog lib propaganda all over this website and characterizing Republican nominees in such a fashion and second of all it is because we know that the demo-rat machine is doing everything it can to smear all of the Republican CAndidates just look what it did to Herman Cain and now they will blow Governor Perry’s honest mistake completely out of proportion and smear him all over the media so it is time for my fellow Conservatives to stand up and defend this great man on this thread in the face of all of these smug gloating prog lib demo-rats.  Thank you.

The problem with the Republican voters is they’re looking for the “WOW” factor and it’s not there.
Partly because they’re rebuilding the party after the drubbing of 2008.

Allow me right here a few minutes of room to go through with you all about the ways in where Governor Perry proved himself here tonight to the satisfaction and the American people why it is that he might or might not be absolutely the single most optimized choice as to be commander in charge and C.E.O. in chief of the whole entire United States of America and abroad.
I’m gonna start by listing all the ways so everyone of you here tonight and also people reading on their YouTubes tomorrow morning and seeing this again in their daily newspapers can keep track of them, and there’s on a few in this short list I have here in my, my jacket pocket … or my other side jacket pocket where I keep my shootin’ iron … shoot, must be my other suit; can’t figure where I put that suit; anyway … I’m gonna list them all out in the same order for when I get to Washington D. and C. because these are easy to remember as the things I’m gonna do right after the plane lands and the other plane with my suitcases I put on the wrong flight back in Austin arrives.
Okay now, Number … number … See, I had that starting number wrote down on that piece of paper I told you all about that I put in my suit, my other suit, not this one, the one with my shootin’ iron and that post card I like to use as a prop on all my stump speeches about how we should have to make things easier for folks when fillin’ out complicated forms like for  filing your federal income revenue taxes. 
Do any of you all here in stage know where I put that suit? I really mean the piece of paper, not the suit, cause I already got a suit on, I don’t need another suit out here.
Well, look, you all are just gonna have to take my word for it, there’s a piece of paper where all this got wrote down, numbers and everything, and if you give me a couple hours I can have my campaign team issue a statement summarizing the numbers anyway, and even the details if you want them too.
So, sorry; my oops. Pass.

He lied about not being able to remember 3 things, is that it? Look, he remembered all three of those numbers, and in pretty much the right order, too.
Anyway, I’m not sure we should be holding it against him that he can’t remember what he said from one day to the next. He has trouble enough keeping track of 2 things, let alone 3. Lying is pretty much the least of the problems we ought to have with this guy. I’m starting to think he’s got early Alzeimers, and I’m not kidding about that. If his handlers had let him do debates against Bill White in the last gubernatorial contest, then this would have come out already and he wouldn’t be wasting our time and tens of millions of dollars in his supporters’ donated money. 
This is no mere ‘not good at debates’ problem. This is a serious brain defect.

Obama wins another Republican debate? You would think as vulnerable as the President is in this upcoming election, the Republicans could find some better candidates. You got the idiot Rick Perry, Crazy Eyes Bachman, Herman Cain (hide your wives), The mormon, The mormon Jr., The guy with the Google problem, The weird uncle who always shows up at your family get together with a new wife and always trying to impress everyone (Newt), and the weirdo creep Ron Paul. 
If the Republicans could run someone who doesn’t appear totally crazy and or stupid. They could probably win the White House, Obama can definitely be beat with this economy, which probably won’t get much better by next November the way he is running things. Republicans will look back at the election of 2012 as a huge missed opportunity.

It wasn’t a good debate performance for Perry for sure; but the media pile on is just as bad.  Obama screws up all the time and you guys don’t bother to be offended by him.
Just think, the latest reveal of emails shows without a doubt quid pro quo between Obama and one of his major donors who got $$$$ for Solyndra and mediaite and the moderators last night were silent on that scandal.
How sad that today’s media is more interested in style rather than substance; good thing our guys went for the substance last night and put the moderators in their place on more than one occassion.
Come one mediaite, how about a story about the emails showing the quid pro quo….you cannot hide the facts from the people and it just makes you guys look a little(?) silly.

Some folks are irrationally critical of our President… In part because they consume media which plays to pre existing bias and tells them things that just aren’t so.  I’m one of the 75% who thinks the country is heading in the wrong direction yet in my opinion the President gets far less than a plurality of the blame.  Obama is far from perfect but the irrational critic and obstinant legislators turn public pain into private victory IMHO.

What Rick Perry should have done was what Reagan always did.  He had 3″x5″ index cards with any facts, lists, or jokes on them for quick, ready reference just in case the mind went blank.  A 3×5 card with the three agencies on them would be all the Perry would have needed to jog his memory.  A word to  the wise: All other candidates should also carry 3×5 cards with important facts on them just in case they are needed in the future.  Lay them out on the podium and know exactly what location on the podium the needed card is placed.  Nobody can remember all facts–even Gingrich.  Always be prepared for prime time.

I never jumped on Rick Perry’s train to begin with, and warned for others not to do so before vetting him, so there’s that…
There’s an obvious market for politicos to tap into tea party energy and co-opt them with rhetoric – and a whole lot of people selling – I’m just saying folks on the right should be much better consumers.

Did Reagan always use cue cards when he was an actor?






Bob Uda



No, he memorized his lines but sometimes used cue cards.  It is easier to remember things when you are younger.  However, as you get older, you need prompt cards.  Obama, however, is a lost cause.  He must have his teleprompter or he is sunk.  He has improved somewhat over the past four years, however.

I think that is against debate rules.
I don’t think it should be, but I believe it is and all participants agree to that.
It really isn’t convincing or comforting to see presidential candidates shifting through note cards to answer questions.
They are expected to know these things, especially if they are sincere about them.
Rick Perry’s inability to remember something so important to his campaign and especially to the voters he wants to attract is far more serious than simple mind freeze.

That is what Pale is saying. Perry does not intend to close any departments. if he did, he would remember them all because they would be important to him. His long “forget” was because he has no intention of following through on it/them.

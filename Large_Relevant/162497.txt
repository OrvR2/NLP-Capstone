Blog Posts by Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsCar bursts through wave of sea foam, nearly hits police (VIDEO)By Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Mon, Jan 28, 2013Tweet0

In this video filmed in Australia’s Sunshine Coast, an amateur filmmaker records a clip of sea foam that has risen up to cover a nearby road. Two friends are heard off-camera discussing a public transportation bus that is slowly making its way through the wall of foam while two traffic cops observe the situation.
About 10 seconds into the video, one of the observers says, “Oh, look, there’s a wave.”
Except, it’s not. What appeared to be a tide of sea foam is actually a previously unseen car plowing through the water. It suddenly bursts through the foam and nearly collides with the two police officers.
There is some mild adult language near the end of the clip, but thankfully no one is hurt in the unusual and entertaining video.

Japanese company builds the ultimate cathouseBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Fri, Jan 25, 2013Tweet0
After getting feedback from thousands of pet owners, a Japanese company has designed a house centered around the needs and desires of the average house cat.
Japanese construction company Asahi Kasei created a home that includes platforms, hidden tunnels and even a litter box situated next to the toilet.
The Japan Daily Press has several photos from inside the new kitty castle. You can also watch this video (which has unusually emotional piano music):

And as the Time article notes, the house itself is built from scratch-resistant materials that are reportedly easy to clean.
Cat culture is growing worldwide. But does a cathouse go too far? Would you buy or rent a home that’s designed to cater more to the needs of your pet than your own?

Cat born without leg bones getting operation thanks to Facebook donorsBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Thu, Jan 24, 2013Tweet0

Harvey, a 4-month-old kitten in Scotland born without bones in his front legs, is happy and healthy. But while his rare genetic condition could lead to spinal problems and other health issues later in life, the preventive surgery is expensive.
Doctors, however, will now be able to go ahead and insert metal pins into Harvey’s legs thanks to a successful fundraising effort from cat lovers on Facebook.
STV News reports that Harvey suffers from radial agenesis. His former owner put Harvey up for adoption on a pet website, stating that the kitten suffered from broken bones. When he was taken in by Scotland’s Cat Protection Glasgow branch, the staff quickly sussed out the real problem.
Cats Protection announced on its Facebook page that it was attempting to raise funds for an operation to help Harvey—and took in nearly $5,000 from hundreds of donors in less than two days.
It will take several months after the operation before Harvey is fully recovered. After that, Cats Protection will adopt

Florida squatter claims ownership of $2.5 million mansionBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Thu, Jan 24, 2013Tweet0
The $2.5 million Boca Raton mansion being inhabited by Andre "Loki" Barbosa (Google Street View)
Thomas Jefferson once said, “If you want something you’ve never had, you must be willing to do something you’ve never done.” But one Florida man says he’s the rightful owner of a $2.5 million mansion because he walked through the front door.
The Orlando Sentinel reports that 23-year-old Andre “Loki” Barbosa is a squatter trying to cash in on a Florida law that says an individual may claim ownership of a property if he can stay there for seven years. Sunrise real estate lawyer Gary Singer told the paper Barbosa is arguing that the obscure Florida law, known as “adverse possession,” applies to him.
The foreclosed, 7,522-square-foot property has reportedly been empty for about 18 months. Barbosa reportedly filed his "adverse possession" paperwork in July 2012.
That a random stranger has moved into the upscale Boca Raton neighborhood isn’t sitting well with its other residents.
"This is a very upsetting thing," Lyn Houston, a neighbor, told the Sentinel. "Last week, I went to the Bank of

News crew attacked by swarm of bees during live reportBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Tue, Jan 22, 2013Tweet0
A swarm of honey bees like the one that attacked a Florida news crew (Wikicommons)Every news reporter hopes his or her work will garner flocks of readers and stir a buzz. The key is to avoid getting stung by an unreliable source. But a Florida news crew experienced a more painful version of swarm journalism when bees attacked the reporters during a live broadcast.
CBS12’s Carl Pugliese says the attack came after he launched a drone camera into the air as part of the team’s report on the demolition of a local building.
Shortly after the drone took flight, the bees began attacking it. Pugliese, not realizing what was happening, then lowered the drone closer to the ground to inspect it.
That’s when the swarm moved in, attacking him and CBS12 cameraman Chad Ellison. Meanwhile, Jenna Caiazzo, embarking on her first assignment for the station, stayed safely ensconced inside the news van during the assault.
Pugliese was eventually forced to dive into his SUV and bring down the drone from inside. Unfortunately, some of the bees followed him into the vehicle.

Giant goat-cheese fire closes Norwegian roadway for six daysBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Tue, Jan 22, 2013Tweet0
Brunost, a highly flammable Norwegian delicacy (Wikicommons)This may be the cheesiest story you’ll read all day—literally. That’s because 27 metric tons of flaming goat cheese burned inside a Norwegian road tunnel, closing nearly two miles of the road for six days.
Brunost, a Norwegian cheese considered a delicacy, was being shipped in a truck that caught fire. No one was hurt in the incident, which firefighters were finally able to put out on Monday.
"This high concentration of fat and sugar is almost like petrol if it gets hot enough," Viggo Berg, a policeman, told Reuters.
As the website Nordic Nibbler explains, brunost is not technically a traditional cheese. It is made from the whey of goat’s milk and can contain up to 30 percent fat. It is described as having a “slightly salty and surprisingly sweet flavor with a hint of goat about it.”
The BBC reported that the truck’s driver noticed the cheese had caught fire and was forced to abandon the truck about 300 feet from the tunnel’s exit. Toxic fumes emanating from the smoldering brown cheese

No, Harvard geneticist is not trying to clone a Neanderthal babyBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Tue, Jan 22, 2013Tweet0
Harvard geneticist George M. Church (Harvard.edu)It turns out that a reported plan to clone a Neanderthal baby was lost in translation.
Harvard geneticist George M. Church was quoted in the Daily Mail as looking for an “adventurous woman” to serve as a surrogate for a “cloned cave baby.” The shocking headline spread quickly across the media with no small amount of help from major news aggregators like the Drudge Report.
But the Boston Herald dug a little deeper into the story, joining a long list of news outlets that contacted Church for an explanation.
Church told the Herald Monday night that the Daily Mail article was based on an interview he gave to the German-language magazine Der Spiegel and poorly translated comments he made about the possibility of one day cloning a Neanderthal.
“I’m certainly not advocating it,” Church told the Herald. “I’m saying, if it is technically possible someday, we need to start talking about it today.”
In 2010, scientists said that most humans carry trace elements of Neanderthal genes in their DNA,

Michelle Obama rolls eyes at John Boehner, sets Internet aflameBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Mon, Jan 21, 2013Tweet0

Monday’s post-inaugural luncheon was a case study in body language--and nearly all of the physical evidence centered on House Speaker John Boehner. One interaction in particular already became an Internet meme: Michelle Obama rolling her eyes after listening to a comment from the Ohio Republican congressman.
Tumblr blogger “Mattyrab” was the first to capture the eye roll in action, sharing video of the exchange in a display described as a “historical moment in shade throwing.” The video has already been shared thousands of times across social media sites with viewers speculating on what sparked the First Lady’s facial expression.
We don’t have audio of their exchange so, for now, it’s impossible to know exactly what Boehner had said. In fact, it’s entirely possible that Michelle Obama's eye roll was simply a reaction to an innocuous joke from Boehner.
That moment was only one of several interactions involving the House speaker. For example, after Boehner’s brief and gracious remarks

Rescued pit bull puppies get a new leash on life (VIDEO)By Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Thu, Jan 17, 2013Tweet0
Hope and her litter of six pit bull puppies (Pet Collective)It’s not easy being a pit bull in Southern California. In fact, it can be downright awful. Two hundred pit bulls are euthanized every day in Los Angeles County alone.
But one family of pit bulls is getting a new lease on life via a rescue operation known as New Leash on Life. The Newhall, California-based company is featured in the new Pet Collective series “The Litter,” narrated by Sharon Osbourne.
In the series, the six male puppies and their mother, Hope, are chronicled on their road to recovery, including through a live-feed webcam where viewers can track their progress.
"The Litter" is the Pet Collective’s second such series, following one last year that focused on kittens and was hosted by Khloe Kardashian. "The Litter," says the Pet Collective, “illuminates the needs of homeless animals—but also is enormously entertaining,” as we follow the dogs’ journey from the streets to their new home.
Watch the first episode of "The Litter":

Florida man killed after dog steps on gas pedalBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! NewsReporterPostsRSSBy Eric Pfeiffer, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Thu, Jan 17, 2013Tweet0
We’ve all seen tragic headlines about a man being killed by his best friend. But this sad story out of the Sunshine State is truly bizarre: James Campbell died after his dog jumped into his van and landed on the vehicle’s accelerator.
The Associated Press reports that Campbell, 68, has just returned home with Iris Fortner, 56, who had backed up to the driveway of their Florida Panhandle home. Campbell got out and stepped behind the vehicle to open the gate, and Fortner opened the driver’s side door to see where he was. That's when her boxer bulldog reportedly jumped in, landing on the vehicle’s accelerator.
The Florida Highway Patrol said Fortner tried to stop the van, but Campbell was already trapped underneath it. He was pronounced dead at the scene by officials.
In separate but related news, a New Zealand rescue dog trainer who has been teaching dogs to “drive” cars captivated millions of viewers last month. In that case, the dogs were strapped into modified car sets and were

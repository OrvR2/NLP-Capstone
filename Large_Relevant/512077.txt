Young Teens Kill Woman After She Refuses To Give Them A Cigarette, Tells Them To ‘Get A Job’

Three teenagers are charged with the shooting death of a young woman in Pennsylvania after she allegedly refused their request for a cigarette and told them to “get a job.” The teens became incensed when the woman tried to stop them from requesting a cigarette from her boyfriend, and at least one of the teenagers resorted to fatal violence to resolve the confrontation. 
Kayla Peterson, 22-years-old of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, was fatally shot on Saturday after she got into an altercation with three teen males, two 14-year-olds and one 13-year-old.
NBC News Philadelphia has the details of the fatal encounter:
Beaver Falls police have charged 14-year-olds Todavia Cleckley and Marcus Velasquez and Kyle Goosby Jr., 13, with criminal homicide and other charges in Saturday’s shooting of Kayla Peterson, 22. She was shot at about 3:30 p.m. that day and died in a Pittsburgh hospital two hours later.
Goosby is in custody and his attorney says he was just “in the wrong place at the wrong time” when Velasquez — identified as the gunman by police and Peterson’s boyfriend — opened fire.
The chief of Beaver Falls Police Department told NBC that the remaining two suspects are still at large.

The headline says that “teens killed” the woman, but the linked story says (based on an eyewitness) that only one of the teens fired the shot.  
Sloppy.

Unbelievable.






shadetree56



saying “get a job” to a libtard is a hate crime.

Horrible.  Some will argue entitlement gone wild…   Others will bring up gun control, both right in this case it appears.  The shooter’s family may have the gun legally but the parent should be responsible for the teen having access to it, whether he was supposed to or not.  That’s what gun safes and trigger locks are for.

Tragic… but what does this have to do with the media? Why is it on mediaite? Seems like it’s just click bait, exploiting a woman’s death.






    http://games-survival.com                            Justplaythegame



I wouldn’t think “liberal” and wait to see how it really turns out.. “kids” can get guns as easily as drugs… neither, legally.






Anonymous



A conservative is going to come on and say the teens could have just as easily beat the women to death and that its not guns that kill people( sigh). It never ends.

Yes, the victim was white and the animals were black or brown.  No idea why the media goes out of their way to confirm that.

How about every western country has its share of thugs. How about every western country has its share of stupid thugs but this one has the most lax gun laws and by far the highest murder rate and by far the highest murder rate with guns. How about you get out of your bubble.

IT’S THE NRA’s FAULT!!!!!!

Now thats a great idea.   Just pass a law making it illegal to own a firearm and all the people will just have to hand them in.  We can melt them all down and make playground equipment for the schools in Detroit.   Wait a second.  With over 200 million firearms in the US do you think maybe the criminals would ignore the law?  No..  I mean it would be a law after all.  How about we try fix the problem with our “youth” instead?






freedomrocks4



they invented planes you know






freedomrocks4



so you have no point…its just the gun fault

No your just to dumb to understand my point therefore for me to go into detail would be a useless exercise in futility.

And no western country is forced to celebrate “thugs” the way we are.  Our influence in that area through hollywood has spread,  but no where is that particular culture celebrated to the degree it is here.

What constitutional right did 13-14 year olds have to a GUN?
 What GUN right allowed them to use that gun because someone said NO to them?
 How is the republican ideology that more guns on the streets is a good thing turn out in this case?






Matt



That’s because you are immensely and intensely stupid.






hayford Osei



yes you are right, but the Gestapo are going to say since the others were there or were walking with him, they are equally guilty…  yep you see from the charges which have been filed so far.. i know more is coming.. Next they will upgrade these 14 year old to Adult Status.. Amazing aint it…
If someone has sex with 14 year old  they would never upgrade that 14 year old to Adult Status.. it is not convenient.

God I love obnoxious liberal effete boys..  You actually made me spit water on my laptop..  Nice.   Actually I lived in western Europe for about 12 years.  Traveled to some amazing places while I was there and never quite got used to the feeling of “Age” every where you went.  Went in the Military so I don’t count those years,  stayed as a civilian working in the Scottish Prison Service.  So I know thug..  I know what there thugs are like and I know our thugs.   Served in the prison service here for a number of years… Our thugs make their thugs look like choirboys.   You’d meet the occasional hard case that would make you a bit wary there.  But even the thugs there had a plan,  or a code or at least a standard they had to live up to.  Here?  It’s like dealing with animals.  Truly pathetic semi human piles of excrement.  So yes,  golly gosh,  I have explored a bit.  Now mind,I wasn’t making a lot of money in the UK so I actually had to live with the common people.






freedomrocks4



so you think the teen bought the gun legally?…..lol






Anonymous



And telling you to; ‘go fµck yourself’ should be seen as a societal service . . .






Gregory Williams



In a way it actually is … they support expanding the number of guns available on the street and they support having NO RULES on how a gun is obtained. They are already screaming DON’T blame the gun every time a gun is used to kill, you even have conservative crazys claiming the gun is a TOOL and that TOOLS don’t kill the TOOL user kills.
Guns dont kill, they are designed only to tighten the screws on a loose door knob…NOT.

Choir boys huh? Yea those IRA guys were choir boys. Along with the basque terrorist and general discontent muslim population who like to burn up thousands of cars in france every other year. Yea bunch of choirboys. You think that the american attitude is different then? You beleive that we are just a more violent people? That guns have no factor in the highest gun deaths in the western world? Ahhh so logical. Don’t lecture me im a police officer tough guy and have been for 14 years. I have seen more blood and guts than you have in your wildest dreams. Your so stupid. GIve great britain 60 million guns and lax gun laws wanna make a bet that gun violence goes up? Wanna make a bet?






Anonymous



I read the website’s description of the charges.  Maybe the authorities are going to try apply the felony murder rule (if PA has it), and claim that the teens were trying to rob the woman.
But the fact is that, according to the witness and the cops, only one of the three shot the woman.






Anonymous



There’s nothing in the article to suggest that the other two knew the shooter had the gun, or that he was going to use it.  The getaway driver is only guilty if he knows he’s a getaway driver.
Mediaite has no basis for claiming that all three killed the woman.

More to the point ─ could you be the product of an act of bestiality . . . ?

Love to take that wager.  And my ass you’ve ever worn a uniform of any kind.  And on the small chance you ever were a cop,  or maybe your mom was and told you stories.  Prison Officers deal with the scum every single day.  Morning until night.  You get to know the particular scum your babysitting after all that time.  Wait does baskin Robbins still make you wear that stupid hat?  Huh.  Reading comprehension not a strong suit eh?  IRA did some bad stuff,  but like a think I mentioned they a code.  A standard if you will.  All of the groups you mentioned did some horrible things, but at least they had some sort of semblance to what they wanted.  You could see some twisted even morality in some of it.  Wrong,  but at least not senseless.  Our culture has become senseless.  We celebrate senseless violence.  Even to the point we blame the violated for what’s been done to them.

Us army from 1988 to 1991. Cop from 1998 to now in one of the most violent cities per capita in the country in a state with very lax gun laws. Don’t  lecture me. Don’t sit on your high horse and claim Europeans are more logical and that gun laws over there have no affect on gun violence. Your talking about a continent that has seen more blood spilled than any other. They woke up. We haven’t. You continue to deny and deflect when reality is staring you in the face. Just as on every other social issue that this country faces. A code. The IRA had a code. Yea except that code got kids blown up every once in awhile.  The muslims in Paris had logic behind burning thousands of cars up two years ago? God what logic was that sunshine? You guys freak when an occupier craps on a cop car but now you say that europeans have some moral code that we lack? Your so naive its not even funny.






Anonymous



OK.  I can tell you what all of that violence was for.  They stated it.  Preached it in some cases.  All of it misguided,  wrong, but at least you could make a rational human argument for it.  Can you say the same for our thugs? There is rational thought involved in some way.  Some human element that you can relate to.  I’ve seen their thugs and the way they live.  No mistake,  they aren’t girl scouts.  But even in prison they live like human beings.  Ours do not.  locked away from the rest of civilization they behave like absolute animals.  And it happens almost immediately.  You can argue that if you’d like, but you’d be wrong.  Ive lived it.  Truth be told the single sickest human being ive ever met was in shotts prison, scotland.  He had beaten a girl to death,  then spent hours with her corpse doing the most heinous things you can imagine.  They do have sick individuals.  We have a sick culture.

how does that theory of your apply in this particular case?

I believe in the right to own guns, but dang if we don’t need to work on doing something about their proliferation in the wrong hands (like these kids or the guy that killed his seven-year-old the other day).
It’s not an either/or situation.






freedomrocks4



so lets hear it






freedomrocks4



so still nothing…..you sit here and whine, but offer nothing






    http://www.monster-island.net/                            kushibo



So the degree of thugness makes the gun culture, but the proliferation of guns in no way elevates the degree of thugness?






freedomrocks4



London cops are morons…wow






Anonymous



Yup thats his point. He thinks that as many americans would die if we had very strict gun laws. Of course he has no idea because we have never had very strict gun laws. So when you compare us to other countries he blames our culture.  So as usual like all conservatives they make up their own facts and assume that the murder rate would be just as high. Just like they assumed Romney would get elected.

Here in Arizona open and Concealed carry is allowed with no permit required.  Our murder rate is much, much, lower than your liberal wet dream states and cities where they restrict gun ownership to the max.

Ok, so, what happens to a country that give up their guns?

Nope.  We as americans have a gun culture.  Ive grown up with them and have a healthy respect for them.  They can be extremely dangerous even with proper training. But they do help us protect our individual liberty and property.  Give a box of guns to a group of thugs and bad things will happen.  Give a box of guns to otherwise well adjusted folks with good impulse control and it wouldn’t turn them into thugs.  Simple.

I remember reading a Japanese study which revealed if the black and hispanic population were excluded, America would have one of the lowest murder (not justifiable homocides) rates in the world.  65% of violent assaults are pepetrated by 13% (by race) of the US population.  I will let one guess as to which race?

Yes, that’s the point.  Mediaite is making the assumption, not me.  The article says there was one shooter, not three.  I am not saying that the other two were not complicit — I am saying that Mediaite is wrong for assuming complicty without any support for the statement. 
Perhaps the other two said, “We want you to shoot the b*tch, it’s a shame we only have one gun or we could all shoot her.”  But there’s nothing in the article that says that.

Your information is completely wrong, TANSTAAFL1. In fact, in 2011 Arizona had the eighth-highest murder rate in the nation. Most all of the more “liberal” states had far lower murder rates than Arizona. So, on this issue you are completely misinformed. On another note, the fact that you would have killed every one of those teenagers if they had asked you for a cigarette indicates to me that you are in serious need of a psychiatrist.

You’re gonna talk about my mother?  How about the line of welfare queens who raised you?, it’s a generational thing.  Think long and hard Truth, how long does the dysfunction go back in your own family?  How long does this racists, violent attitude go back?  How about the fact your own mother didn’t teach you right from wrong.  She taught you to covet and hate people who are successful.  That whites, all whites, are bad.  Take a long hard look at your own family lineage, and you’d see it started back about five generations, and it hasn’t gotten any better with you.

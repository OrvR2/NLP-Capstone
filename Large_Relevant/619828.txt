Coulter On Gun Violence: ‘If You Compare White Populations, We Have The Same Murder Rate As Belgium’

Ann Coulter visited Sean Hannity‘s show Monday night to discuss President Obama‘s recent cabinet picks as well as his possible actions on gun control. Coulter said she had just come back from England where they have “not bought into” the “diversity enthusiasm” of the States. “The liberals,” Coulter claimed, are “pushing and pushing and pushing” to have more mass murderers of color. 
“If you compare white populations, we have the same murder rate as Belgium,” Coulter said. “So perhaps it’s not a gun problem, it’s a demographic problem.”

Hannity asked the conservative commentator what she thought would be the result if the “imperial” Obama “shreds the constitution” by taking executive action on gun control and the debt ceiling. Coulter said she didn’t think he would do that but said if he did, Republicans should push back: “We won’t ban abortions, we will just ban abortionists and abortion clinics. How would that be?”
She claimed Obama and his administration were “not serious about doing anything about shooting in America” and went on to opine that banning high capacity magazines would be useless.
Coulter also quipped that her opposition to Obama’s appointments was that they were all “white men.” Hannity agreed and sarcastically said, “this is an outrage.”
“The lack of diversity shocks me,” Coulter added.

Problem is, when you look at the 60 some odd mass shootings we have had in recent years, all but a handful, white males.
White collar crime, including multi-billion dollar scams, are, as the name suggests, mostly white people crimes. Not even a small fraction of white collar crime is actually prosecuted. 
And imagine the crime rate if you eliminated men from the equation. Now you would really have a much safer country.

Instead of calling her a racist, why don’t you just look it up and see if she’s wrong. Serial killers are rare. Gangbanger murders over drugs, and “cred”, and territory are not.






John Barleycorn



And everyone would be living in lean-to’s. What have women ever manufactured?






Mr. Sinister



“Maybe it’s a demographic problem…” That is the most thinly veiled racist comment I have ever heard… Forget dog whistles, she used a freaking fog horn that blasts “white pow’r!”
And by the way, have you compared how many children die in gun accidents here compared to Belgium? You can cherry pick the data all you want, mr. Coulter. How many white children die is mass shootings here compared to Belgian children? How many white mothers and fathers get shot in domestic disputes in the US compared to Belgium? I’m willing to bet my last dollar that the numbers are VASTLY different…

Misrepresenting facts can be done by racists.  Any criminologist worthy of the title will explain that rates of crime are not racially determined.  Poverty is the #1 cause of crime, race isn’t a factor whatsoever.
Any person who claims or implies that people of a certain race are inherently more criminal is a racist by definition.

Interesting….Mr.Sean said ’19 Executive Orders’……hmmmm, and his point is :  2001~(54), 2002(31), 2003(41), 2004(45), 2005(26), 2006(27), 2007(32), 2008(30) All under POTUS BUSH~~~~2009(39), 2010(35), 2011(34), 2012(36) So far under Obama!!!!
Not a fan of Coulter….but, from 1976-2005 the homicide rate for Whites was about 10 per 100, 000 according to BJS!!

Good thing republiklans aren’t sexist either.

“…we will just ban abortionists and abortion clinics. How would that be?”
It would be an outrage.  Just ask the people of Mississippi, North Dakota and other Republican run states who have cut funding for Planned Parenthood and put onerous regulations on women’s health clinics.  Or states like Missouri and Wyoming, where there are no providers.

Yes because only shootings with multiple casualties matter right? Who gives a sh*t how many blacks kill other blacks in a week?  Right?






Esteban Rey



Correlation does not = Causation.  This is very basic stuff here, Cleetus.






Mr. Sinister



Look at drug convictions. Cocaine, a drug mostly abused by rich white people, carries a mandatory sentence 10x shorter then crack cocaine, a drug abused by mostly poor minorities. What, are coke dealers kinder and gentler then crack dealers, because thats ultimately what drug laws are supposed to suppress; the illicit drug trade.
Rich, mostly white people can go to their doctor and get a prescription for opioids (Vicodin, OxyContin etc.), but poor people on heroine get thrown in jail for getting the same high. Rich white ladies used to abuse Benzedrine (aka Bennies) for years consequence free, but once the poor started to use methamphetamine, a cheaper form of the drug, all of a sudden it’s illegal.
Maybe we have a double-standard problem in this country, instead of a demographic problem.

Exactly right. The question should be…why? You supplied the answer. This why FOX appeals to the uneducated.

In the words of Joe Wilson:  “YOU LIE!”
2010 Justice Department statistics show that 49% of murder/manslaughter convictions were white; 48% were black.  Assuming that there were at least some female killers, that would put the number of black males far below 50%.






Mr. Sinister



Correction, they are CONVICTED for 50% of murders… How many white folks do you think get their murder charges busted down to manslaughter per year? Hmmm? Care to make a guess champ? And that doesn’t include the dozens of black men who are falsely convicted every year.

Race-obsessed idiots will be race-obsessed idiots, it’s best not to correct their outrageous claims so they’ll keep making them.
I was hoping when I saw the headline that this site would try to back up Coulter or try to show her wrong. Instead, they did neither.
So, would anyone else care to fill in the gaps? Do the overall stats (not just some very high profile cases) support Coulter?






Mr. Sinister



This. When the big picture is shown, the racists like Barleycorn stutter and stammer. Thank you for sharing this.

I suppose she will get away with this, but Ms. Coulter made a verifiable claim which doesn’t verify.  The murder rate for white Americans is about 3.5 per 100,000.  The murder rate in Belgium (which is by the way by no means an all-white country) is 1.8 per 100,000.  She is off by a factor of 2.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but is she suggesting attempts at gun control should not be pursued because it is a demographic (black) problem?






NeoKong



His theory does not hold up under real world empirical evidence and crime statistics and you know it.
Young black males commit homicide at 4 times the rate of their white counterparts and there is no white enclave anywhere in any poor white community that has a murder rate even close to what is in the black community especially Chicago which is the most deadly city in America by far.

and the highest murder rate in America is CHICAGO (insanely strict gun laws) and vast majority black on black MURDER…






Mr. Sinister



I couldn’t tell you what she is saying, I don’t speak crazy.
It sounds to me that she is saying if there were only white people around, but the same amount of guns, there would me less murder… 
But that doesnt jive with relity. Japan has almost no white people there, but very few guns, and they have a much lower murder rate. And it’s not a cultural thing, because Hawaii has the lowest white population per capita (~23%) but it is ranked 38th in murder… Wouldn’t hawaii have more murder, since more white people=less murder in her eyes? Incidentally, there are very strict gun laws in Hawaii.

What I want to know is why we even keep these stats – and why is it broken down as just “black” and “white”? 
There is just soooo much wrong with the assumptions that can be made here (and are).
Does the one-drop rule apply?
Does anyone consider where the demographics of class, environment, or education comes into play – the fact that about 30% of “blacks” or Hispanics yet only only 10% of whites live in poverty – and that type of environment is much more likely to place one as either a victim or offender of violence.
Then there is the obvious problem of only comparing convictions – which has always plagued minorities in our justice system.

Incidentally, there are guns all over Africa and South America. Oh wait a minute, are you going to claim that this correlation is meaningless, but your correlation is correct? It’s so cute when idiots talk them-self into a corner… 
By the way, it doesn’t matter what race you are, crime rates are more or less the same. What differs is the type of crime committed, the poverty rate (which shifts crime rates upward) and… Most importantly… The conviction rate.

Mr. Sinister



Here is a quick guide to help you spot racism in your community. It’s easy enough that even a dimwit like you can follow along! Ready?
If a person tries to claim their own racial superiority, or another race’s inferiority, then, ding ding ding! You got a racist. If they attribute character traits to a person’s race or culture, even if its a good trait, then ahooooga! you got a racist. If someone exhibits a double standard, where the main or only difference between two situations are the races of the people involved, then boom shakalaka, you have a racist in your midst.
Now if someone is trying to correct racial inequality, be it in a system, or in perceptions, then you do not have a racist. If someone tries to call out racism that exists in others, then they aren’t racist, they can just recognize racism. 
Now you go get some sleep, it’s way past your bed time. You can practice this tomorrow, and maybe one day you will be less of an ignorant douche! :)

if white males are so genetically, and morally superior as a whole by virtue of their whiteness, then why is there a murder rate at all in white communities? Oh, thats because there are social forces that can affect an individual. Oh those social and economic forces tend to impact and direct itself against people of color. Oh, we have a justice system that punishes one race versus another….and then thats not even explaining the horrors inflicted upon poor black people for centuries by whites. But Im sure thats just manifest destiny. Blacks deserved, enslavement, jim crow, lynchings, rapes, murders. You make me sick

Coulter. It’s probably no accident that I see an advertisement for Bill Maher’s show at the top of this page. Ms. Coulter is not only the other side of the same coin, but buddies with Maher.
They both do the same thing, making crude jokes that are divisive but not funny. Perhaps occasionally they’ll come up with an angle that has an element of truth, but their arguments aren’t meant to accomplish anything (positive or constructive, anyway). I doubt they care at all about the politics they capitalize on. If you cheer either of them, or cite them to represent your supposed political opponents, you’re either being dishonest or you’re gullible.

She’s not saying that white people don’t murder. She is saying that blacks disproportionately commit crimes in this country including murder.  Nearly every negative statistic from STD rates to teen pregnancy to high school dropouts and crime are highest in the black community.  That is sad and embarrassing.  Are you seriously arguing with that? 
And Japan shouldn’t even be in this discussion because they have a homogeneous society where immigrants are constantly reminded that they are Gaijin.  Even Okinawans aren’t considered “real” Japanese.  It’s a lot easier to come together when everyone has a shared history and culture.

No one needs to subscribe to your advocacy of utter political apathy, accomplishing and achieving nothing.  A “moderate” is not an individual who ignores problems, hoping they go away.

Good. So, in the broader scheme of things when liberals rightfully call Republicans racist for doing/saying racist shyt conservatives can no longer retort by calling liberals themselves racist for daring to discuss matters of race. Because facts themselves can’t be racist.  So, no more calling the folks over at MSNBC racist for simply talking about matters related to race, because all they’re doing is reporting facts.

Very well said Sinister. Well said indeed!






Mr. Sinister



Let’s compare poor whites, poor Hispanics and poor blacks, because the numbers among that social strata aren’t very different. If you compare middle and upper class in each race, again, you will find that the numbers for crime, violence, std rates, teen pregnancy etc. are also similar. It’s just that more minorities are (kept) poor, so they are over represented.
And spare me about Japan. Consider the burakumin. They are similar to the untouchables in India. The burakumin are ethnically Japanese, but they have a much more difficult time finding work or getting into college. If your ancestors were involved with death industries (undertaker, embalmer, funeral pyre maker, grave digger) you are considered burakumin, and an employer will consult centuries old registries to discriminate against you. Consider the ethnically Koreans, who were only recently allowed to apply for citizenship, despite being in Japan for generations. Consider the brazilians, who are a large minority group in Japan, and face marginalization. We all know brazil is a violant place, yet in Japan, the crime rate remains low. Social programs, education and yes gun control are the biggest factors that contribute to Japan’s safety, not a perceived “shared history.”

22 dead in Obama’s and Rahm Emanual’s Chicago since the beginning of the year. Last year over 500 killed in Chicago. This is Obama and Emanaul’s own city that they have run for a decade and these guys are the ones that know what needs to be done to solve gun violence. Hysterical! And Chicago has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation. This entire gun control topic is just another political move by Dems to try an win points against Republicans/conservatives.

If you took drugs out of the equation, something that is mostly consumed by white people in the suburbs and on college campuses of those cities, then the drug wars and the violence in cities would definitely be much less. In fact the violence is not about race as much as it is about poverty, and in every culture in the world and throughout the centuries, crime is always greater in the ghettos regardless of which ethnic group is down there.






Anonymous



Wow you must be really dizzy after all that spinning. The fact is that Coulter is right and if you want to decrease death by guns you need to do something about the culture in these neighborhoods where 50 – 70% of kids are born out of wedlock and the rap gangsta gang culture is killing thousands of kids. Why doesnt Obama harp on that instead of promoting these rappers on his ipod and bringing them into the White House.

White people may plot a mass murder from time to time but that pales in comparison, obviously, to the nightly bloodbaths in some of the cities in America.  They are more a “way of life”.  The NUMBER of PEOPLE capable of doing harm to others is what’s disturbing & it’s most typical in areas with a higher black population.  It’s not racist to state facts.  There’s clearly an inherent problem.

The demographics are “poor” and “uneducated”. Statistically, killers are three times more likely to have an income below the poverty level, and their two times more likely to have not completed high school.
You’re looking specifically at race, not at the more likely, statistically strong indicators of cause of crime.

Good morning Michele:  This plays into just what I was talking about with you on another post.  Now I’m starting off by saying that I have no idea if what Coulter said is true or not.  But for argument sake lets say that it is (for now).  Is what she said off limits? Or is it something that’s a fact that we would rather not acknowledge?  In other words.  Is it racist if it’s true?  This is why I think that there are no “winners” in race discussions.  Each side (myself included) will just point to racist remarks said by the other side.  And it’s a shame that we’ve become, “sides” but the fact is that we have.  When I’ve suggested putting the race issue behind us I’ve been told that white people have no right to determine when race issues will be put behind us.

“There has been a lot of media attention recently focusing on Chicago’s 2013 murder rate, and for good reason. In the first six days of 2013, 12 people were murdered in the city. At a rate of two murders per day, this puts Chicago on a pace for 730 murders for the 2013 year. Compare that with 2012, where there were 506 murders in the city, or 18.7 murders for every 100,000 citizens. While these numbers are certainly alarming, the number of murders for every 100,000 citizens is significantly lower in Chicago when compared to a number of American cities. In fact, Chicago doesn’t even come close to making the cut for being one of America’s 10 deadliest cities in 2012.”

This post is directed at Madfoot. Facts can’t be racists, but a person misrepresenting facts can be. And you’re assuming Ms. Coulter has not misrepresented any facts. Unfortunately that not the case here. Just her line off the top that UK has “not bought into the diversity enthusiasm”. Well the FACTS are, the immigration is rising in the UK. Has been for several years. 1 in 8 Brits are now foreign-born and that percentage will increase in future years.
I’m feeling confident if I did an analysis of Ms. Coulter’s other “facts” I’d find significant flaws in the data as well.  But this is something that would take an afternoon to research and verify. Suffice to say, you should always question and check the “facts” against other sources who do not share the same motives as each other, preferably unbiased ones.

You just want to slander black people to avert attention from the abnormal number of white sociopaths who walk the streets every day with no chance of being arrested until they explode on innocents with semi-automatic killing machines with 50 shot magazines.
Bait and Switch. Crime is redefined every day in state houses and courtrooms. Crime includes shoplifting and failure to shut up when a cop tells you to. The topic is murder and you switch to crime and speak in generalities without facts. When did catching an STD become a crime? Black people will always have a higher crime rate because black people and black neighborhoods are  the targets of law and enforcement efforts.
Keep that in mind when you walk down the middle of a dark alley. You would probably veer away from Wayne Brady and rush into the arms of a Hells Angel biker with a ball peen hammer behind his back.

If you go to: http://www.bradycampaign.org/xshare/Facts/U.S._Firearm_Deaths_and_Death_Rates_by_Race-Ethnicity_Intent.pdf, you’ll find:
 “White Gun Deaths” were 18,861 vs 11,625 “Ethnic Gun Deaths”, or 62% of all US deaths. 
If you go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate, you’ll find a chart of gun deaths by Country. 
The US has a 10.2 rate and Belgium a 2.43 rate. If you reduce the US rate to “Whites Only”, then the US “White Only” rate is 6.1 versus Belgium’s 2.43. Sorry Coulter, we’re still almost 3 times the rate of Belgium.

You’re actually right. The issue of race and racism have become social and political minefields for individuals on each side. Conservatives have taken to calling liberals racist for simply talking about any issue concerning race. However, there are very few opinions that Conservatives can give regarding race without being called racist themselves by liberals. However, deep down I believe everyone wants to talk about the state of race relations. Think about it. The stories on Mediaite that get the most clicks and comments are always about race. Last spring those Trayvon Martin stories were getting as much as a 1000 comments. However, I’m on this site a lot and it’s a consistent finding I’ve observed. The issue of race ignites passions like no other and people on both sides of the aisle are eager to jump in. Why is that? I think its related to the way we talk about race in “the real world” I believe there’s a lot of repressed feeling surrounding race and the anonymity of the internet gives us an outlet to push the envelope and “tell it like it is”, but even on Mediaite we fall into the habit of calling each other racist  and throwing verbal bombs. It’s become nearly impossible to be civil in discussing race….or anything moderately political these days. =}

I’m a liberal and I did not Anne’s miss the point. She’s saying it’s not the amount of guns in America, it’s who owns the guns. And that if it was a vast majority of white people in the US (like in Belgium) the homicide rate would be much lower, without having to implement gun control. did I get that right? (feel free to apologize)
Problem is, Anne is cherry picking her facts. Like I said in a post below (and also feel free to respond to it) Canada has a similar ethnic makeup, but it has 1/3 less homicides. So that fact undermines her theory.  But she doesn’t want people to know these facts.

Belgium”, which is like saying, “if you remove all minorities, we’d be safer!”), then she has a right to do that. But let’s unwrap ourselves from the Fox-sewn flag and call her and Sean our for what they are.

So true. Moreover, Mexico, being “all Mexican” has a similar death rate to the US even with their massive drug wars, and South Africa, being “all Black” has a similar death rate to the US, with all their racial issues. Applauding whites for being less murderous is absolutely asinine when we think we live in the greatest, safest country in the world.

So you are saying, we have a problem with gun violence, but we can’t talk about the problem with gun violence.  
Makes about as much sense as anything else the left is pedaling these days.
It would appear that the guys who are worthless when it comes to national discussion are in fact the left who like the deny, deny, deny and if that doesn’t work, pull out the old race card.
How the hellll do you plan to solve a problem, when you deny the problem?

well let’s see here – most mass murderers have been white – why – who knows? I don’t know who owns more guns because I’m going out on a limb here but criminals don’t register guns and I would guess don’t get them legally at all. Have you heard of the city of Chicago? Guess how many hands & feet you think you’ll need to guess this years murder rate in say a 4 block area around where your imperial king lives? If last year is any indication my guess would be LOTS. What do you think a model of gun ownership in that area would be? My guess again would be none! I haven’t spent a lot of time researching who owns guns. I don’t but I don’t care if someone else does. If you put yourself in a bad situation bad things will happen with or without a gun. 
As far as Canada’s homicide rate – I have no clue – nor does it matter. Maybe because they allowed prayer in school? Maybe they have concealed carry laws?  Where do most people live in Canada? Cities? You know it gets cold there – not much going on the streets in Baniff most of the year. Their ethnic makeup is similar to whose?  What city? The entire country? And even if the ethnic make up is the “same” as you claim – where are the murders being committed?  As with voting if 99% of the 12% vote the same way – and they live in the same area – what does that say?

But is she right? Yes, she is right, and you can quite clearly see that in the crime statistics. You take blacks and hispanics out of America and it becomes an incredibly safe nation for its huge size almost overnight, it is not the white population responsible for the vast majority of homicides, gun crime, violent crime and racially motivated attacks, its mainly the black population.
So how is she a ‘racist’ for simply speaking the truth? Would you prefer she didnt?






tabb



Is it just me, or is this woman on something, seems like she’s got a habbit






James Flower



Which are a very, very small minority in all gun crime deaths and homicides. Well over 50% of all homicides in America are committed by 13% of the population, large numbers of those through illegally held handguns.
Why are liberals so damm afraid of the truth about anything to do with race?

James Flower



I live in the UK, and just because immigration has risen and we are being forced to be more ‘diverse’ doesn’t mean we are happy and ‘enthusiastic’ about it.
Native white British people were never asked if they wanted their nation transforming, and we are not ‘enthusiastic’ about it at all, so she is right.






Francis Arsenic



Nice mental gymnastics to support your worthless ego. I can tell. I’m a professional.

How is rape and sexual assault caused by poverty?
Because blacks are also hugely over-represented in those statistics, why is that?
And explain to me why poor broke-ass white people dont commit these types of crimes anywhere near the rates of blacks? The poorest white areas have crime rates nowhere near those of the poorest black areas.
You are so scared of the truth, aren’t you? The truth that we are not, never have been, and never will be ‘all the same’. Genetically it isn’t true, socially it isn’t true, and culturally it isn’t true.
Low intelligence levels are also a proven trait of those who commit crimes, and if you look at the large differences in average IQ’s between races, you will find that those with the lowest averages, commit the most crimes in the nations they are in.
Why could that not be the truth? Why is it racist to point it out?

I think your ignorance is showing. First Canada’s homicide rate does matter – well at least more so than Belgium’s – which is the crux of this whole article/video. Second, there are lessons to be learned from Canada and how they are far less violent. You can apply these lessons to improve things in your own country. (Or do you not want to lower your homicide rate?
And the fact that you know so little about the Canada, is worrisome. You’re asking all the wrong questions. You talk about weather, but don’t ask about gun control laws. You want a geographical breakdown of the ethnicity and population of the country (which is not a factor)- but don’t ask about the amount of gun ownership in Canada. Its like you are more interested in defending a position than finding solutions – so you avoid the more illuminating questions.

Google murder statistics by race. Either way you look at it- perps or victims- the racial disparity is astounding. If all Americans murdered at the rate of whites, the murder rate would be less than half of what it is. If all Americans murdered at the black rate it would be more than twice what it is. That’s why we don’t understand the harping on irrelevancies, when the elephant in the room is so obvious. We need Giuliani time on a national basis.

For the record, it’s very difficult to get a handgun in Canada.  They have strict gun ownership and gun storage laws.  No one can own an assault weapon.  If you’re convicted of an alcohol- or drug-related offense, or you are arrested on an assault charge, your gun is confiscated until you can re-prove your competence.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Canada

and it suggests you dont have a depth of intelligence in which to weigh up and consider this information.
the fbi do not suggest what you suggested at all – you just made a leap and ascribed racial underpinnings to a social problem






Anonymous



It could be the truth.  But it’s statistically irrelevant.  When you talk about violent crime, race far lower down the list on determinant factors.  More important:  economic situation, education, alcohol/drug abuse, family/community involvement, etc.  
Race is not a determinant in crime.  Rich black people are no more likely than rich white people to commit crimes.    (In fact, when it comes to things like domestic violence or white-collar crime, white people are far more likely to commit the crime as income rises.)  
To put this solely on race is, well, racism.

btw – as if to further prove you dont have the intellect to understand this issue – you went and proved coulter wrong anyways.
considering belgium’s murder rate is not half or even close to half of the united state’s, you simply disproved coulter’s theory when you said this “Blacks are 12% of the population and commit 48% of the murders. ”

And I do believe that a person who wants to kill someone will do so no matter what be it with a gun or without. Once again I don’t live in Canada. I do not think ethnicity is the reason for violence. I don’t know but I’m certain no one knows for sure. You can speculate until the cows come home but I would think people who murder people do so for their own individual reason.

Jack: you seem clever enough, so let me make this point to you. When you seek to end senseless murder by firearms, what you want to do first is to target the people committing the killings. Now, while it’s true that most of these multiple murders by mentally ill people are committed by whites, the vast, vast majority of gun murders are committed by urban gang members and the urban poor who have decided that the way out of poverty is by committing crime.
I don’t want to get into racial profiling here because I don’t have to. You know, I know, Barack Obama knows, and the rest of the world knows who commits the vast majority of these crimes, though you may not feel comfortable around your liberal friends actually identifying them, primarily because they’ll want to argue that “if whites hadn’t impoverished them they never would have turned to murder.”
What most people right now are doing is focusing on Newtown, Conn., because children are to mass killings sort of like white fuzzy little bunnies are to the PETA people. And we should do what we can about deranged people who murder, though it’s hard. Their behavior is unpredictable and they are, in a sense, anonymous, until they strike.
But, while we know where to find the killers in the urban areas, few outside of the police want to do enough about it, even though that is what represents the worst gun violence in the U.S. And Chicago is the worst — the home of Mr. Obama and his chief bootlicker, Rahm Emanuel, on whose watches murder in Chicago has risen to very, very disturbing heights.
Unfortunately, there are no fuzzy little bunnies in Chicago, so we’ll spend more time talking about mental health and less about taking back the cities from these thugs. If you want to have a real discussion about gun violence in America, you have to put away all your silly stereotypes of gun supporters and start thinking intellectually, not emotionally.

Prayer is optional in Catholic schools in Canada, it’s done in a chapel in the school. But you’d know that from the sounds of it.  Anyway, I was responding to a post asking if there was prayer in school, and I understood it to mean mandated by the government.  Catholic schools do not have mandated prayer in their schools either.  It’s why they are allowed to remain as public schools.  Even the religion you are forced to take has a non-denominational options when it comes to subject matter.  I know this because I just got off the phone with a friend of mine who grew up in the Catholic school system in Alberta.

Not sure where you live but if you’ve seen the news about Chicago’s south side you might get a different “impression” as to what the cause might be. It doesn’t make it correct but hard to fight. But more kids do die in swimming pools then by guns yet we want to get rid of guns “for the children” why aren’t we getting rid of pools? Like Fort Hood was work place violence? Like drug lords in Mexico aren’t using guns supplied by our Justice department? So it is OK for our government to give guns, automatic assault weapons but we have to take them away from US citizens.

From the RCMP website: 
Involvement Of The Criminal Element
The illicit firearms market is characterized by a wide range of criminal participants, particularly individual entrepreneurs to full-fledged members of criminal organizations. These participants drive the market, either as consumers or, occasionally, through random individual sales to other criminals.
Predominantly, single criminally-inclined individuals and independent organized crime groups play significant roles in the Canadian illicit firearms supply chain. Independent organized crime groups appear to be involved in providing specialized goods and services to a number of other criminal organizations — sub-contracting services that may facilitate importation/exportation and inter-provincial movement of drugs, precursors, firearms and cash. It is difficult to identify key individuals or crime groups involved in the firearms trade as this is often a secondary level criminal activity in support of their primary activity, which often involves the illicit drug market.
A large number of criminal organizations use firearms, thus the demand for this reusable commodity continues to fuel the illicit firearms market in Canada. Firearms can remain in circulation for many years and be used multiple times as they have an indefinite shelf life.
http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/10/25/bc-gun-seizure.html
The three types of gangs I alluded to basically encompass all gangs, or organized crime, so I was hardly breaking it down to three individual gangs.

P.S:Ironically Ann to illustrate her points of crime stats is also mistaken if you remove all the “Blacks” then the US rate to “Whites Only” is 6.1 versus Belgium’s 2.43.

Just to shoot down the premise of your missive:  
“vast majority of gun murders are committed by urban gang members and the urban poor who have decided that the way out of poverty is by committing crime.”
No.
According to FBI crime statistics, murders occur more for domestic arguments than gang activity.  You’re as likely to be shot by the family member or friend sitting next to you than by a Big Scary Black Gang Member. 13.8% of murders were committed by family members; 30% by someone the victim knew; and 12.4% by someone the victim didn’t know.
http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10shrtbl06.xls
Of the 12,000 murders in the US in 2010, only 900 have been attributed to gang activity.  Four times more people–3,600 victims–were killed as a result of domestic arguments between family members or friends.
Statistically, you’re as likely to be killed in suburbia (12/100K population) or in rural American (11/100K population) than in a large city (12/100K).  And you’re more likely to be killed in a small city (less than 100K in population, at a rate of 14/100K) than a large city.

that is not what Ann was saying – that is not what any person with grey matter is saying.  What they are saying is that you can control all the guns that lawful gun owners have -it won’t make any difference in the murder rate.  What will make a difference is if the Al Sharpton’s and Jesse Jackson’s of the World acted like the “reverends” they claim to be and start focusing on why black on black crime is so horrific.  Try solving that!  You can’t solve a problem you refuse to identify.  That’s complete insanity.  
Don’t preach to me – I’m sure the helll not killing anyone, nor am I armed, nor do I care if you take every legal gun away!  I won’t even kill a spider (carefully take it outside) so don’t freaking preach to me!

Guess what – you misunderstood your “friend” – perhaps it’s the language barrier eh?
If you are not Catholic, you are allowed to go to a Catholic school and you partake in religious class.  That is how non Catholic children can attend.  If you don’t like that “rule”, go to a public school.   Schools do not have “chapels” either – at least not in Alberta.  I’m sure in some districts in Toronto and probably in Quebec, but I don’t know that for sure.  Just assuming that that older districts might have had them.  
One of the “schools” I am familiar with, the Church met in the gym until the congregation raised enough to build the Church.  They put away the chairs, altar and everything else while the gym was a gym.

Incidentally, I live in Baltimore, which has one of the highest murder rates in the country, but it’s been declining in the past six years.  The reason?  When Republican Bob Erhlich became Governor of Maryland, he cut funding for city police and other city programs.  He loosened gun laws and handcuffed police who wanted to get guns off the streets.  He refused federal funding for the COPS program that the Clinton Administration offered, and refused to file required reports from the state government when the city applied. (Curiously, though, in the non-minority counties like Montgomery, Frederick and St. Mary’s, his administration had no problem submitting paperwork.)  He cancelled gun buy-back programs that were very successful, and he defunded community outreach programs.
Murder spiked 20% when he was governor between 2003 and 2007.  This when national trends for violent crime rates were falling.
Now, all violent crime in Baltimore is down.  We’ve got fewer police on the street, but they’ve gone back to Community Policing, with more cops on foot patrol, bikes and horses.  The state has more gun store inspections and buy back programs.  
And by the way, before you start talking about “my liberal friends”, you may want to know that I worked for a Republican governor in another state.  My brother worked for three Republican presidents (Reagan, Bush I and Bush II) and two Rep guvs. My father was appointed to the state cabinet of a Republican guv, but declined the position.  Another brother, my sister and my brother-in-law all held appointments by Republican governors, Senators or Justices.  I am not a knee-jerk liberal.  I am a business owner who should be in the “Republican sweet-spot” based on my beliefs but I’m sick of Republicans ignoring the true issues for political gain.  And I cannot stand self-described conservative who make up information to promote an idiotic talking point.

There are around 1 million burakumin in Japan, who are ethnically and culturally identical to other japanese down to their DNA.

They are mostly poor, suffer from marriage discrimination, face discrimination when applying for jobs and are not very economically mobile. Now, get this, the largest organized crime syndicate in Japan, the Yamaguchi-Gumi yakuza clan, is made up of 70% burakumin. Now, can you think of other comminities similar to this in the US?

Bull. You are logically challenged. Poverty and murder are not causal. Latinos are poorer than blacks and don’t murder or become murder victims as often. Poorest sections of Appalachia don’t match inner city rates. Blacks today are much more violent than their great granparents. It’s a problem with current culture in the community. Also. the country’s racism is proven by the fact that we don’t treat it like the emergency it is. Not that somebody points it out.

First rule of statistics: Don’t compare apples with oranges.  Coulter was discussing murders, the Brady stat includes suicides and accidents.  Delete.
Regarding the Wiki page:  Again you are citing total gun deaths which include suicides and accidents.  The correct page to cite is:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate
Here you will find that Belgium had a 1.7 per 100,000 murder rate and the US a 4.8 per 100,000 rate.  The list included the raw number of 14,748 murders.  However, additional analysis reveals that only 49% of murders are perpetrated by whites.  Thus, white committed 7,226 murders in the US.  According to the 2010 Census there were 231 million whites in our country, yielding a 3.1 murder rate.  Coulter exaggerated her claim a bit to make a point.  However, the black murder rate was 17.5, more than 5 times the white rate and approaching Kenyan numbers (20.1).  
Bottom line, despite her exaggeration, she has presented a valid point for the American public to digest.






    http://politicaljunkiehandbook.com/                            derekcrane



Actually the website you cited presented misleading stats.  They claimed that the “white offender rate” was 4.5 per 100,000 in 2008.  The correct number, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics is 3.3.  They are quoting, from the same source, a cumulative stat encompassing the period 1980 to 2008.  
But you miss Coulter’s main point, “So perhaps it’s not a gun problem, it’s a demographic problem.”  The Black offender rate in 2008 (the last year available) was 24.7 in 2008, about 7.5 times the white rate of the same year.  
She does, indeed, have a point.

And this is your perception, right? Facts, please?  Statistics?

Okay, let’s say those are true.  (I’m not going to waste my time researching your typically fictitious data.)
Your trying to make the point that black people kill more people, right?
If you’re doing a study, your next question is, why?
Your reason, from what you’ve posted, is this:  black people kill more people because they’re black.
White people are arrested for drunk driving at EIGHT times the rate of black people.  Obviously, all whites are drunks, right?  And you should assume that every white driver is drunk behind the wheel.  If that’s not the case, then why are whites arrested at such an incredibly higher rate?  It MUST be because of their race, right?
Let’s look at statistics for rape: rapists are three times more likely to be white men. 
According to your reasoning, this is because: white men rape because they’re white.  Whites–based on your reasoning–are pre-disposed to be rapists.
Your simplistic rationale does not hold up.  If you cannot make a parallel to other crimes and races, then race is not a primary determinant of any crime.

The “Stop and Frisk” program has NOTHING to do with the drop in violent crime rates in NY.

Have you or anyone else tested the race variable?  Yes, you can perform correlation analysis with many variables, but you will find that race and crime will score very high.  For example, whites with similar socio-economic backgrounds and education levels as the average black have a far lower crime rate, although the crime rate for these whites are higher than the average white crime rate.  This suggests you need more than education, poverty and other socio-economic factors to explain the difference. 
You want to compare countries with tough gun control with countries with lenient laws? Try Mexico (stringent gun laws and high murder rate) compared to Switzerland (lenient laws and very low murder rates).
BTW, what does “commitment to strong social governance” mean?  Sounds Orwellian.






Vaughan Starr



I’m a little confused here. If taking firearms away from people makes all of us safer, why does Great Britain have a far higher rate of violent crime than the Sates (2034 violent crimes per 100, 000 vs 446 per 100, 000 for the US)?
If it is just all about the culture or respective poverty/affluence, removing guns from the equation seems to do nothing whatsoever to address this. People still act violently, only now they are far less likely to suffer any resistance to their actions. For now, the law abiding are unarmed.

Because you are not comparing apples to apples due to differing definitions of violent crime in the US and the UK.  
The US definition of violent crime consists of five major crimes:  homicide, manslaughter, aggravated assault, rape and armed robbery.

Despite what the ACLU claims, the truth on the ground, is that it became too difficult to carry a gun in NYC. Your odds of getting caught went up under Giuliani and Bratton’s quality of life crackdown. Criminals don’t obey any laws. So jumping turnstiles, peeing in the street, smoking dope, tagging, petty theft, etc. were all correlated with firearms possession.
Do any of you comprehend the difference between causation and correlation?

Almost all of them were white. A lot of them were Jewish, so what? Your fixation on race blinds you. A Yalie stealing ten million didn’t do it because he was white, and a banger busting a cap in ol Hakim’s ass didn’t do it because he was black. That doesn’t change the fact, tht if you want to stop gun crime you don’t target Jeff Greenberg up at Goldman, and if you want to end securities fraud, there’s little point in auditing Jamal Jones over in Anacostia.

Of course race isn’t a behavior. But the behavior in question is unevenly distributed accross the races. So, if you want to stop murder by gun, your biggest bang for the buck isn’t at the suburban gun show, it’s in the urban communities where the killings are occuring. Stop the killings and everything else gets better. Again, NYC is the example. It’ s a very, very small proportion of those communities that’s causing the mayhem. In places like Richmond and Trenton, it’s a matter of just a few hundred feral males. By the way, every police official in the country knows exactly what I’m talking about to be true. If they deny it, they’re lieing to secure advancement. Do you know what Comsat is?






Vaughan Starr



So it’s all about definition? The idea that violent people become less violent without guns doesn’t really pass the smell test. I know that in the UK right now they are in the grip of knife hysteria with one respected body calling for the restriction of kitchen knives! 
If it is all about the class warfare stuff of respective poverty/affluence that the left trumpets, then you would expect to see similar crime stats across various ethnicity’s’  when the only criteria is relative poverty. But you do not. This fact alone shoots down the idea that violence is exclusively poverty driven. 
So, if violent people don’t become less violent when guns are removed. And if poverty is not THE factor in violence and other cultural influences contribute. And, if those who will commit violence will not be giving up their firearms, law abiding citizens should be denied the right to arm themselves by the Government why?

Yes, it IS about how you define “violent crime” when you’re compiling statistics.
Think of this:  two people are told to go to the same grocery store and count the servings of fruit.  One person counts only fresh fruit:  one apple, one bunch of bananas, one bunch of grapes, etc.  Person Two counts each individual banana, each individual grape, each apple… AND each can of fruit and each bag of frozen fruit and each serving of fruit juice.  You’ll have two very different totals, but each will reflect what the person counting considered a serving of fruit.
So it is with how each country defines “violent crime”:  the UK definition is much broader, while the American statistical definition has only five categories.  
Please note that I didn’t say violence is exclusively “poverty driven” as you put it.  I’ve noted a number of factors that are pertinent in the study of violent crime.  I have, however, said that race is not a primary determinant factor of violent crime, as many others on this post have claimed.
Some people are violent by nature, yes.  The gun argument comes down to the damage a person can do when enraged.  The kill radius of a gun is typically hundreds of feet, if not miles.  A weapon with a large-capacity clip can inflict damage on a great number of people in a large area.  The kill radius of a knife is arm’s length.
And before you spew about the Anti-Kitchen Knife movement in England, please post the study by the supposed “respected body.”  I’ve seen one report, by the British version of The Onion.

By your logic, Lady Gaga and Kim Kardashian are more relevant than Ann Coulter because they have more followers.  If the make a political statement, should their “wisdom” be considered seriously?
Her “truth” is irrelevant because it is not pertinent.  I turn my lights off every night when I go to bed, and the sun rises the next day.  Does the sun rise because I turn my lights off?  No, of course not.  Just because two things are facts does not mean they are related.






George_Gooney



Yes the “race variable” has been tested. Race is simply a social construct that determines hierarchy, treatment, and above else discrimination by political, legislative, and social apparatuses. Now here is where the rubber meets the road, because your only end game here is to advance debunked biological deterministic theories that certain “races” are inherently better, more moral, and more well behaved biologically, as determined by their racial classification, and has nothing to do with any environmental influences.  
BTW, to compare poverty levels between races still doesnt work, unless you are able to compare household environment, history of mental illness within family, density of neighborhood, and other variables which have a direct influence on personal outcomes.  You know, all the things we examine when white people do something crazy, so we can find out “why”, rather than explain actions by race, exclusively, which racists are prone to do when blacks commit crime.






George_Gooney



3.1 is almost double the rate of belgium. Thats far from exaggerating “a bit”. Thats not even close….so, what accounts for the difference there, smart guy? Are Belgium’s whites just genetically superior to American whites? Or could social environmental factors that differentiate, explain why there is such a wide difference?






Vaughan Starr



That an enraged individual with a gun can exact more damage than one with a knife is self-evident. The question though, is should law abiding citizens, the bulk of whom would be otherwise largely defenseless against a powerful aggressor, be denied the right to defend their own life by Government? 
Say you remove all guns, will gun deaths go down? Absolutely. Will a lot of people, women especially, be rendered helpless? Yes. That is the flip side of the coin. One which you quite dishonestly avoid. That is the cost to all the “Won’t someone think of the children?!” chest thumping that is currently taking place. A lot of gun advocates acknowledge the cost of the freedom to defend themselves. Those who would restrict this right never, at least in my experience to date, acknowledge that there is a pronounced cost to a Government forbidding free men and women the right to defend their own lives. There is always a bill to be paid for utopia. And all too often it is the individual’s rights given to him, not by a Gov that rules by force, but by the Creator of that individual.

I was just pointing out the fact that crime statistics are flawed because minorities are prosecuted more than whites for the same type of crime, say theft.

Gun murder rates are pretty straightforward. There’s a body. You can see the color of the vic.
You don’t want to get into the stats on interracial crime. That will really make your head explode. The biggest statistical mis-match is black on Asian vs Asian on black. White guys don’t rape black women. When you start doing more complex numbers- weighting for age, population percentages, locale, etc.. The patterns are very, very clear. As I mentioned above, in most places, you don’t really have to take too many people off the street to make a big difference.

When 70% of black children are born out of wedlock to single-parent, female headed households, it’s not at all racist to question why blacks are disproportionately involved in gun and other violent crimes.  
SENSIBLE Democrats, those like Daniel Patrick Moynihan, used to question those sad demographics.  But now that the Democrats have been taken over by looney-tune Leftist/Marxist/Communists, any  distinction in the demographics of the races is “racist”.
I guess the party of the Old Copperheads and racists like Robert Byrd and George Wallace are too embarrassed by their horrendous racist past to discuss race intelligently; they constantly over-compensate.  (Most extremely, in nominating a hack Chicago pol with barely a year of active duty in the Senate as their nominee for president.)






one question



What are the murder  rates in Russia, Germany and any number of predominantly caucasian municipalities around the world?  For that matter historically how many crime syndicates and organized crime families have been black or of African American descent? How many mass murderers have been black? How many serial killers and other such Psychopaths have been black?  Back when the west was being ‘won’ how many black gunslinging killers were blacks?  How many white officers have been ‘accidentally’ shot, during undercover and plainclothed details, by other white or even black officers? How many white youngsters have been shot while walking home from the store because the ‘so called’ neighborhood watch mistook them for criminals? How many caucasians have been shot 47 time by black or white officers for reaching for their ID? How many of the illegal guns mentioned were procurred ‘illegally’ by any number of the same supposed upstanding white citizens desiring to keep guns available – for all? There are very few poor honest people – in the hood – with guns and permits for them, so where are these illegal guns coming from? Several times it’s been said that these so called murder rate statistics for the predominantly minority neighborhoods are high and committed with illegal guns, well they’re getting them from somewhere.  Someone has said address the problem well if illegal guns in these neighborhoods are the problem then why not address the problem at its root? Where are the guns coming from?  We could spend years sifting through statistics and making them say anything we wanted with the right formula but if we’re to address the facts then it’s simple – Crime comes in all races, creeds, religions, colors, financial statuses, and locations.  We cannot address everything with one sweeping blow, so we attack what we can and correct the obvious.  Only severely limited thinking keeps people arguing such intangibles as race in causality. We would then have to also include half and mixed races as well as the exact composition of the mix. If you seriously want to remove guns from those who are using them illegally, regardless of where and how, then start by limiting how many are available in the first place – a thief can’t steal what’s not there.  My apologies for such a long post and the misleading handle – One  Question.






Anonymous



You don’t seem to be able to use reason or logic. You make assertions (typically fictitious- blacks kill because they’re black, etc.) that have no basis outside of your projections. Do you know the difference between causation and correlation? The point is that neither the stats on b on b murder, nor the current furor for banning weapons have anything to do with the assumptions you present and imagine to be based on logic. You, and the Prez share fallacious assumptions based on erroneous assertions of fact.






Anonymous



You need help with reading comprehension.  The assertion–”blacks kill because they’re black”–was my summary of your position, not my position.
My point is–and has been–that race is not causal when it comes to crime.  One does not commit a crime because of his/her race.  Nor is race directly correlate to crime:  high minority population does not definitively equate to high crime rates.  
You were the one positing that blacks have higher crime rates because of their race.
This last post of yours is a complete repudiation of everything you’ve argued, and you’re attempting to assume my position.






Anonymous



Seriously. You are engaged in projection. And, the whole point is, seemingly, beyond your comprehension.
I bet that when there’s a racial component to a problem- not enough Firemen are black- too many Hispanics get diabetes- cops give speeding tickets to a disproportionate number of Cambodians- whatever race based statistical “problem” is identified, you’re all for government/court interventions to redress the “imbalance.”
But, you are basically wrong, high “minority” population is a correlation for high crime rates. At least in the USA it is. The question remains, why all this blather about assault weapons, when you can see high gun crime areas from the WHite House porch, and none of those crimes is committed with an AR-15.
You need to admit you have a problem before you can fix it.
Here’s your big clue, and I’ll leave off: fatherlessness.

So you’re saying that there’s a correlation between race and crime.  Agree or disagree:  if black people make up the majority of people living in a neighborhood, there will, without exception, be higher crime in that neighborhood?






Anonymous



In the US, on average, yes. Again, your thinking is muddled. You are looking for something that isn’t there. That’s what I mean by projection. Inside your head, you have a little voice that is insisting that the only possible reason to discuss this is racism. That noticing any statistical correlation between race and negative behavior can only be motivated by racism. That’s why, instead of a serious and honest discussion of crime prevention, you are engaged in a trying to prove your preconception to be fact. Hence, the “without exception” formulation. Meanwhile, since we began this discussion, at least 6 young black men have been shot dead. Not by whites, not by NRA members, not by the mafia, not by cops, not by the Klan, but by other young black and brown men. But, if we would just outlaw “assault weapons.” everythign will be fine. If you’re really from Baltimore how can you not get this?






Anonymous



Or in prison. California murder rates are increasing as the jails are emptied. It is really a very small percentage of the population that commits most of the crimes. It’s just that they commit a lot of crimes, and they don’t stop unless incarcerated, killed or they age out after 40 or so.






Anonymous



No, a serious and honest discussion about crime starts with the economy, wealth inequity, job creation, drug/alcohol abuse reduction, family & community involvement and education.  I’ve said that before; I’ll say it again.  If you have a neighborhood impacted by those factors, you will have crime.  Doesn’t matter if it’s Baltimore, Phoenix, Portland, or Bangor:  the highest crime areas are also the ones with the highest drug use, domestic problems, gang activity, joblessness and poor schools.
The question I asked was a gauge to identify how far you’re creeping back from your statement that you can pinpoint crime by race.  
My point is that race is not a determinant factor or causal link leading to crime, and you cannot say that uneqivocally say that because a neighborhood is predominantly black that it is high crime.






one question



And of course any thinking man also knows dead is dead, and if done by firearm in an urban or rural community it’s still death by firearm.






Anonymous



You seem to have missed out on the entire Great Society thing. Poverty, education, drug problems, etc., etc., have been on the agenda and the targets of massive federal, state and local efforts for fifty years. Our poor people are “richer” than they were, but we still have as many poor people as ever. FYI the number one correlation is between marital status and poverty. If you are married to your children’s father/mother, have a high school diploma and are over 21 when you have your firstborn, your odds of living in poverty are about 3%. If you don’t do those things its around 75%. SO, back to the point of the discussion.
If you want to reduce gun crime. You. like any good marketer, will analyze the data and determine who your most likely firearm wielding criminals are. Then you will address that population with vigor. That, as has been proven, will reduce murders more quickly than any other possible scenario.
I’m not walking back anything. About half our murders are committed by a cohort of our population that constitutes about 3 percent of Americans. That cohort is conveniently concentrated in a relative handful of counties and a relative handful of census tracts within those counties.
That target audience is young black males between 15 and 35 years of age.
If you flooded no more than a couple of hundred census tracts with police resources, prosecuted gun crime with vigor and incarcerated for substantial periods any and all found with illegal firearms, you would, in a very short period of time, see a major reduction in felony murder and other serious crime.
If your obsession with race prevents you from acting, in accordance with reality, in the best interests of the community, then, you are a racist!

Wow… “About half our murders are committed by a cohort of our population that constitutes about 3 percent of Americans.”
100% of our murders annually are committed by about 0.004% of the population.  We should call that cohort…oh… let’s go with “murderers.”
Let’s talk about “firearm wielding criminals” for a second, and the marketing efforts for them.  Let’s start with the “firearm wielding” people BEFORE they commit the crime.  Of course, I’m talking about the gun owners who somehow or other “lose” an estimated 500,000 weapons each year, which fall into criminals’ hands.  Like the gun dealer in Virginia who had dozens of sales to non-existant customers.  Or the 62% of online gun dealers who don’t do required background checks.  Or the private owners who don’t keep their weapons securely in a safe.
(If guns in a household are there to protect the homeowner, doesn’t it make sense that the guns should be locked up if the homeowner isn’t home?)
Let’s start with marketing to them:  “Unless your gun is in your not-yet-cold-dead-hand, keep it secure in a safe.”
Let’s increase the auditing of gun dealers’ inventory, which the law allows, but which has been limited to ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS because of budget cuts lobbied for by the NRA.
Let’s mandate background checks on employees of gun dealers, similar to the way we do pharmacy employees.
Let’s mandate that if a gun owner or gun dealer “loses” a specified number of weapons over a given time, they forfeit their right to possess more weapons.  And let’s make gun owners responsible for abetting the crimes their guns commit because of their recklessness.
Get the guns off the streets by ensuring they stay in the hands of their legal owners.

Again, he is saying that of the President’s proposals, those are the one’s likely to have an effect. However, his article is mainly about the outstanding reductions in crime he engineered in New York by using modern targeting technologies to concentrate his resources on those most likely to commit crimes. Hence, the contention surrounding “stop and frisk,” which is now working its way through the courts. 80% of NYC shooting are committed by young black men. They are 60% of the victims. Blacks are 23% of the population. Young black men between 15 and 35 are about a tenth of that population. So, if a little over two percent of your population are involved in 80% of your gun crime, why is it wrong to target them for aggressive interventions?

How about:  IT’S UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  
Note as well that Bratton makes it clear he is not supporting random “Stop and Frisk” laws.  He makes it clear that before the subject is frisked, the subject is questioned and that there’s probable cause for the search.  
If an individual is targeted simply because of their race, it’s unconstitutional.  If an individual is searched by police without cause, it’s unconstitutional.  If a person is detained without cause, it’s unconstitutional.

That’s one of the amazing elements of this problem. It’s not just a relative handful of people who are creating the mayhem, it’s also true that their “range” is relatively restricted. If you start researching this, you’ll find that the neighborhoods affected- and this is true all over the country- are quite definable. There’s plenty of research down to the census tract level. That’s what made Bratton/Giuliani’s program work. They defined their targets. and didn’t waste effort trying to be strong everywhere.
L.A.- if you look at the numbers, has enjoyed a good drop in serious crime. I’ve worked with young people, and the truth is, most of them are good kids (better than I was!).Some of their folkways- the music, the clothes, the language- can be offputting, but most of them have good hearts and want to do well. Society owes the right to personal safety to everyone. The good kids in the “bad” neighborhoods deserve protection as much as the fat cats. This whole discussion is about effective anti-crime strategy. I reccomend you look ate S. Pinker’s book about violence. We are lucky to live when we do.

You can’t block out the words you dislike, use the ones that support your preconceptions, and claim to be honest. Bratton, very clearly states the court’s position: you may stop those who you suspect have committed, are committing or are about to commit a crime. 90% plus of those stops in NYC are black or brown men. Bratton’s police are the exemplar of the common sense gun crime reduction policy called for in Coulter’s article that has lead to this whole discussion. Go back to Bratton’s piece and read the recipe for gun crime reduction: target criminal activity. Don’t wait for the call that a crime has been committed, instead, find the criminals and harass them. Again, people were being killed to the tune of 2200 per year. After a couple of years it was cut by 2/3rd and NYC became the #1 tourist destination in the world. People cannot tolerate a lack of public safety. Broken Windows- prof Wilson showed the way.






Anonymous



Conversation over.  If you can’t read the article you yourself have cited, there’s no point.  Bratton very clearly points out the “Stop & Frisk” actually means “Stop, Question & Frisk”.  It’s not a random search; you don’t just go up to a black kid and say, “I’m searching you.”  There must be probable cause, and the officer must justify the search later.
When Bratton took over the NY Transit Police, he recognized that stopping small crime led to stopping large crime.  He didn’t randomly prevent people from riding the subway or the buses.  He arrested people for turnstile jumping, for graffiti, for harassing passengers.  He did not–I repeat, DID NOT–support random searches or expelling people unless they did something to warrant it.
Your concept of “about to commit a crime” sounds more like the “Precrime Unit” of minority report.  Probably cause is key to the legality of it; it’s not simply, “Hey, that black kid has a 70% probability of committing a crime later.  Let’s stop him because he’s black.”
I have a relative who spent 25 years as a police officer.  He was very active in community policing, and taught the officers he trained that that most effective thing a cop could do was simply ask every, “Hey, how’re you doing?”
And research is important:  NYC is the 13th most popular tourism destination in the world, after London, Paris, Bangkok, and many others.
Done.

Bratton said “about to commit a crime” as per the courts. “Expel”??? NYC #1 in world 2012. Article clearly states frisks only followed after questioning. One weapon per 25 frisks. 43000 guns of the street. Community Policing was the failed and discredited theory the Comsat approach replaced. You just want to make a race issue. If it was blue-eyed Poles creating the problem, you’d want them in camps today.

There are approx 200 million whites, and 40 million blacks, and yet the same number of blacks were arrested for murder as whites. So that means the murder rate for blacks is about 5 times the rate for whites.

…all the factors you mentioned can be tested.  There is no assumption by a good researcher  that one of these factors, like race, is better than another.  All they do is measure the strength of the relationship, taking other factors into consideration —  Strictly numbers and statistical testing.  The fact is that blacks do commit crimes at a far greater rate than their population, poverty level, education level should indicate.  Not a social construct, just a plain old fact.

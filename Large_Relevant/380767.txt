Baby Boomers Plan Their Retirement CareersBy Dave Bernard | U.S.News & World Report LP – Fri, Jan 27, 2012

Retirement for the baby boomers is likely to be far different from what their parents experienced. Work will probably be an integral part of everyday life, both to meet financial requirements and to keep busy during an increasing lifespan. Workers approaching retirement should plan now for their pending retirement career.
[See 10 Places to Launch a Second Career in Retirement.]
Most baby boomers (72 percent) say they plan to keep working in some capacity after retirement, according to a 2010 Del Webb survey. The top reason for working in retirement is to ward off boredom and keep busy, while financial necessity came in second. Other reasons for delaying retirement include self-satisfaction and enjoying the job. Some employees are planning to continue working well into the traditional retirement years. A recent Wells Fargo survey found that 25 percent of middle class Americans say they will need to work until at least 80 to live comfortably in retirement.
If seniors will need to work during their retirement years, the nature of the job becomes increasingly important. During our first career we discovered what we are good at, what we like to do, and what we dread doing every day. This knowledge can help us prepare for our second act. Here's how to select a satisfying retirement career:
Aim for a job you enjoy. In a down economy you may be forced to take any available job. But if you are lucky enough to be able to consider a job you might actually enjoy, decide what it would look like. What could you do each day that would make you eager to get out of bed each morning, with great expectations of exciting things to be? It is far better to start the day with an optimistic smile versus an anxious moment.

Avoid toxic situations. Decide what you would find personally satisfying in a second career and also the tasks you would dread doing. A typical job includes a mix of each, but ideally you want to tip the scale toward what you love.
Test drive your dream job. When you were younger, what did you dream of becoming? Although a ballerina or an astronaut might not be realistic now, think back on what it was you always wanted to do. If a certain career field still intrigues you, try to explore opportunities for a retirement career trying it out.
Play to your strengths. After several decades in the workforce, you probably already know whether you prefer flexibility or routine, independence or supervision, creativity or clearly defined activity, and risk or assurance. Look for a second career that has the characteristics you find most important in a satisfying job.
[See 7 Misconceptions About Retired Life.]
Try something new. Try to incorporate something you feel passionate about into your retirement job. Take steps to impact the direction of your retirement career, rather than just letting it happen.
Dave Bernard is not yet retired but has begun his due diligence to plan for a satisfying retirement. With a focus on the non-financial aspects of retiring, he shares his discoveries and insights on his blog Retirement-Only the Beginning.

Definitely propaganda to keep us off the social security rolls.  We can find plenty to keep us busy without the added stress of work and resentment of younger workers who need the jobs!

.........STOP THE ANTI-RETIREMENT PROPAGANDA!!!..............

I worked 44 years & now I'm enjoying the fruits of my labor. I don't want to work again..I 

have plenty of hobbies...the CEO's want people to work until they die. The worst day of 

retirement is better than the best day of being in the cut-throat environment of the rat race.

Also..the propaganda of us living longer..we are not..the WWII generation is..we are living 

less due to stress, diet, lack of exercise, greed, etc. Retire as soon as you can...what's 

the point of retiring into a wheelchair or rest home. ENJOY LIFE..you earned it.

Relaxing with no guilt....

Dues payer of life - Mike

RE-ELECT NO ONE *** RE-ELECT NO ONE *** RE-ELECT NO ONE *** RE-ELECT NO ONE! 
Serving in Congress is an honor, not a career.  
Our Founding Fathers envisioned citizen legislators, so ours should serve their term(s), then go home and back to work.
Before you support or vote for a candidate:
TELL ALL THE CANDIDATES TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING CONTRACT WITH AMERICA!

CONGRESSIONAL REFORM ACT

1.  TERM LIMITS:
    6 years maximum for any individual serving as a legislator with the following two options:
        A. One six-year Senate terms
        B. Three two-year House terms

2.  NO TENURE AND NO PENSION:
     A representative or senator collects only a salary while in office and receives no 
     compensation once he or she is out of office.

3. CONGRESS MUST PARTICIPATE IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEMS:
    All funds in the congressional retirement plans must be transferred to the 
    Social Security system, immediately.  All future retirement funds will flow into the 
    Social Security system; thus, allowing all legislators to participate with the American
    People.
    Members of Congress can purchase their own retirement plan, just as many Americans do.

4. COMPENSATION:
    Members of Congress will no longer be permitted to vote themselves pay raises.  
    Congressional pay will adjust each term based on the lower of the following two
    Options:  3% increase OR Consumer Price Index (CPI)

5. HEALTHCARE:
    Members of Congress will participate in Medicare and the same health care system as the 
    American public. The current congressional health care system will be abolished. 

6. LAWS:
    Congress must equally abide by all laws they impose on the American people.

These crooked corupt tyranous politicians have stold 15 % of my wages for s.s and medicare to fund their own pet projects. I should have enough in my accounts to live off of just the interest alone on the accounts. They are no diferent than bernie madoff or enron and deserve jail time.

No matter what you do. No matter how hard you work and save. The immoral capitalist will exploit the sick, the weary, and the gullible people. Pay attention people!

I retired last year at age 59. I spend about 1/3 to 1/2 less than when I was working - not because I have to, just because it worked out that way. I love not having to be somewhere at 8:30 a.m. Monday through Friday. One of my biggest joys is doing nothing, simply breathing in the gift of life.

Perhaps the most upsetting moment of the Islamic terrorist attacks of 911 were those agonizing images of the desperate men and women who jumped or fell from the top of the WTC Towers. On the broken window ledges, 1300 feet up, for how long did these poor people contemplate that unimaginable fall? All of the 9-11 victims and their families deserve our eternal sympathy and understanding. God bless America and her friends.http://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2002-09-02-jumper_x.htmhttp://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2002/09/langewiesche-excerpts.htm     ______________________________________________________From a Sept. 8, 2009 Esquire article by Tom Junod titled "The Falling Man"They began jumping not long after the first plane hit the North Tower, not long after the fire started. They kept jumping until the tower fell. They jumped through windows already broken and then, later, through windows they broke themselves. They jumped to escape the smoke and the fire; they jumped when the ceilings fell and the floors collapsed; they jumped just to breathe once more before they died. They jumped continually, from all four sides of the building, and from all floors above and around the building's fatal wound. They jumped from the offices of Marsh & McLennan, the insurance company; from the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, the bond-trading company; from Windows on the World, the restaurant on the 106th and 107th floors -- the top. For more than an hour and a half, they streamed from the building, one after another, consecutively rather than en masse, as if each individual required the sight of another individual jumping before mustering the courage to jump him or her self. One photograph, taken at a distance, shows people jumping in perfect sequence, like parachutists, forming an arc composed of three plummeting people, evenly spaced. Indeed, there were reports that some tried parachuting, before the force generated by their fall ripped the drapes, the tablecloths, the desperately gathered fabric, from their hands. They were all, obviously, very much alive on their way down, and their way down lasted an approximate count of ten seconds. They were all, obviously, not just killed when they landed but destroyed, in body though not, one prays, in soul. From a Sept 11 2001 Truthquake. com article 9/11 Victims ForgottenThe only research that comes close to being an official account is buried deep in an appendix of the huge report into why the towers collapsed, conducted by the National Institute for Standards and Technology.As part of its research into where the fire was at its most intense, NIST analyzed camera footage and still photographs, and counted 104 jumpers, often recording the floor and exact window from which they left. All but three leapt from the first building to be hit -- the North Tower. The second plane struck the South Tower 16 minutes later but it collapsed first, giving people less time to react. The first jumper is recorded plunging from the North Tower's 149th window of the 93rd floor on the north face of the building at 8.51 am, just over four minutes after it was hit by the first hijacked Boeing 757 between the 93rd and 99th floors.Sometimes the people falling were separated by an interval of just a second. At one point nine people fell in six seconds from five adjacent windows; at another, 13 people fell in two minutes. Twenty minutes after the building was struck, two people fell simultaneously from the same window on the 95th floor. At least four jumpers tried to climb to other windows for safety, but then lost their grips. One person climbed from the 93rd floor to the 92nd, clinging to the window's edge before falling just one second after someone else fell from the same window -- number 215 on the east face of the tower. The early jumpers came from the crash zone where the plane entered the building -- the offices of the insurance brokers Marsh & McLennan.The last jumper fell just as the North Tower collapsed 102 minutes after the building had been hit. ______________________________________________to answer all the enquiries about the soundtrackit's  Child of the Troubles by  Roy Toddhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/album/tomorrow-begins-today/id348572523______________________________________________9-11 did they escape from the impact zone 9/11

This is just so boring, unfortunate but overdone, a﻿ tragedy but fabricated to the brink of being just an outtake from a Michael Bay movie.

To all the morons who are﻿ saying "inside job"- The reality is- you're a bunch of insecure idiots who have the need to prove that you're "smarter" than the rest of us and you can see what everyone else doesn't see. You're pathetic! If you really think that your leaders would do this to their people- WHY ARE YOU STILL LIVING HERE? Go live in another country and spread your shit. You'll probably get your tongue cut out.

Bravo - these little 911 trolls who piss on the stars and stripes have no intention of living anywhere else- they know they already live in the best country in the world but﻿ unfortunately for their fellow Americans they enjoy disrespecting the dead too much. It's likely their parents are asses too so it's to be expected i suppose

I thought I should watch, let the dead know they didn't go un-noticed. I sit here looking at my screen and I so badly want to reach up there and catch them. I want to save them. But I wasn't even there. Then I saw the young fireman watch a man fall - as helpless as I am today to help them. He most likely died trying to help. I just want﻿ to catch them... please god, I just want to catch them... So much sadness and pain. Why do we humans have to be this way. We would all want to be saved

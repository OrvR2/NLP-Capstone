Pop star Lady Gaga expressed her sadness and sent her condolences to those who lost loved ones in the Brazilian nightclub fire which claimed 232 lives on Saturday.The singer shared a picture of herself praying, writing:‘I’m thinking of you today during this tragedy.’The big-hearted star will no doubt feel particularly moved by the events after discovering that one of her 'Little Monsters' lost their life in the blaze which occurred in Santa Maria. Scroll down for video 

Upset: Lady Gaga shared a picture of herself praying following the nightclub fire in Brazil 
 Taking to Twitter following the events of Saturday morning, she retweeted a message from a follower which reveals the tragic news about her fan.

It read: ‘A Little Monster died in a tragedy here in Brazil! His name is Luiz Felipe! Mother Monster Pray for him! @ladygaga #PrayForSantaMaria +181.’The message prompted her to write: ‘My heart is with you Brazil,‘Sending my prayers to the families and friends who lost loved one in the fire in Brazil. Im thinking of you today during this tragedy.’ 

All about the fans: Lady Gaga greeted fans as she promoted her Born Brave Bus Foundation on Saturday - she later discovered one of her Little Monsters lost their life in Brazil 

 She completed the message writing ‘#prayforSantaMaria’ and by sharing a picture of herself doing just that. In the image the Born This Way star appears to be make-up free and still lying in bed.While her hair looks a little matted, it also looks as if she not wearing a top as her hands are clasped together. In the early hours of Saturday morning a fire ravaged through the nightclub in Brazil, killing 232 people.  

Performance: Lady Gaga always finds time for her fans in between her busy schedule like performing with Tony Bennett recently 
 It was claimed that bouncers stopped people escaping because they could not prove they had paid their drinks bills.Up to 2,000 people - mostly students - were in the Kiss nightclub om Santa Maria, southern Brazil, when the fire started.While the official cause of the blaze has not been stated, local reports claim it was sparked by a firework set off during a band's performance.Most of the victims died of suffocation or were trampled in a stampede for the venue's only emergency exit, police said.The nightclub was operating illegally, the fire extinguishers were not working, and many victims confused the sign for the exit with that for the toilets, where 50 were later found dead.VIDEO Brazil in mourning as it comes to terms with nightclub fire

I think this umpteenth publicity stunt of this desperate fading star, who is struggling to sell tickets and has to sell albums at cut price has backfired. Does she think we are all stupid? Praying is a contact with one's God, not the media... Ooops, I forgot her god is publicity, so maybe she did the only thing that suited her. Infortunately, Gaga is an extreme child of the 80s: all image and no substance. Strip her of her ridiculous clothes and stubts and what is one left with? A medicre singer who can't dance, write songs that could as well have been written in the 1980s, a boring tour, fake accounts ob twitter, fake hots on youtube, basically, her name should be Lady Fake...

And to all those complaining about it being a publicity photo; Terry Richardson walks around with his cameras wherever Gaga goes and takes pictures, documenting her, her friends/creative team and Taylor Kinney's life.

I have no problem with her documenting photographer taking a photo while she is praying, the tacky part is POSTING it!

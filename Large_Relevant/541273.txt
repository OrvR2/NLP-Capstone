Blog Posts by Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsAnonymous donor gives $1 million to needy Las Vegas familiesBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Mon, Jun 25, 2012Tweet0
The house always wins. Anybody who's been to Vegas knows that. But sometimes the house is kind enough to give back some of its winnings. An anonymous casino owner in Sin City donated $1 million to United Way, which in turn passed on the funds to struggling Las Vegas residents.

The million dollars was split between 2,000 families and given in the form of gift cards. Each family got $500. Might not sound like a lot, but when the money is badly needed and totally unexpected, you end up with some very happy recipients.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal explains that this is the second time the same anonymous donor forked over a million bucks to residents of southern Nevada. The first was in December. The paper writes, "The only thing that changed this time was the donor's nickname, Summer Santa instead of Secret Santa." The recipients were asked to

Matt Sandusky says he was abused by father, Jerry SanduskyBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Thu, Jun 21, 2012Tweet0

Just hours after the sex abuse trial of former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky wrapped up on Thursday, his adopted son revealed that he had been "a victim of Jerry Sandusky's abuse" and had offered to testify against his father.
It is unclear whether prosecutors were prepared to put Matt Sandusky on the stand. But NBC News reports that Jerry Sandusky's defense team decided against having the former coach testify on his own behalf after they learned that prosecutors planned to call a new witness -- believed to be Matt Sandusky.
Earlier Thursday, the jury of seven women and five men began their deliberations on the 48 charges levied against Sundusky. They are sequestered and there have been no indication when they might deliver a verdict. Those jurors heard both Jerry Sandusky's defense attorney and the lead prosecutor in the case deliver pointed closing arguments. Defense attorney Joe Amendola painted the former coach as a man victimized by overagressive cops, social works and

Cable worker helps save woman from fireBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Fri, Jun 15, 2012Tweet0

Not everybody hates the cable company. In fact, we're pretty sure that Dawn Donjay is a huge fan. Donjay had fallen asleep in her Boston apartment when she heard screaming from somewhere outside. "Fire, fire," the voice yelled.
[Related: Police rescue mother, child from fire]
The voice belonged to Henry Gallagher, a TriWire employee for Comcast Cable. Gallagher spotted the smoke and called 911. While he waited for the firefighters to show up, he went inside to see if anyone was there. The fire department arrived in a matter of seconds, but things could have been a lot worse were it not for Gallagher.

"I love him to death," Donjay said. "If I could get him right now I'd give him a big hug and kiss, take him out to dinner. He was awesome."
The fire's cause is still under investigation.

Coast Guard: Reports of yacht explosion may be hoaxBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Mon, Jun 11, 2012Tweet0
UPDATE: Coast Guard officials now say that the report of an explosion on a yacht off the coast of New Jersey may have been a hoax.  Searchers have been unable to find any debris, a sign that there may not have been an explosion at all, a Coast Guard spokesman said.
...........
An explosion aboard a yacht reportedly caused all 21 passengers to abandon ship, safety officials say. The yacht was reported to be 17.5 miles off the New Jersey coast, east of Sandy Hook. The Coast Guard has deployed helicopters and rescue boats to the scene, but has yet to find any signs of the explosion.
Little is known about the cause of the explosion, but according to early reports, as many as nine people were injured in the blast. All passengers have been accounted for. WABC reports that the Coast Guard was alerted to explosion aboard the yacht, named Blind Date, at 4:20 p.m. A nearby vessel, named Erica, was reportedly helping with the rescue while Coast Guard personnel were on route.
As of 6:15 p.m., the

Jeb Bush speaks about aging father, George H.W. BushBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Thu, Jun 7, 2012Tweet0
Jeb Bush 
In an interview with Charlie Rose on "CBS This Morning," former Florida governor Jeb Bush revealed that his father, George H.W. Bush can no longer walk unassisted.
Jeb Bush said his father, 87, is still good mentally, but "he can't walk... He has to, you know, he's help by a stroller... That's hard for a guy that's been so vital and vigorous in life."
[Related: George W. Bush's favorable ratings lowest of any living president]
Indeed, there are few senior citizens as vital as George H. W. Bush. For many years, on his birthday, the 41st president made it his habit to skydive from an airplane. He did it for his 75th and 80th birthdays, as well as number 85 back in 2009.
In 2009, after landing, he joked, ""It's a great, exhilarating feeling... I don't feel a day over 84."

Is Congress getting dumber?By Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Mon, May 21, 2012Tweet0
The Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.
Think members of Congress act like a bunch of high school students? You might be on to something. A recent study from the Sunlight Foundation found that members of Congress tend to speak at about a 10th-grade level.
The Sunlight Foundation analyzed every word spoken by every member of Congress on the floor of the House or Senate. Sunlight imported the words into a searchable database and then "ran them through an algorithm to determine the grade level of congressional discourse," according to a buzzy story from NPR.
The finding: Congress is speaking at a lower academic level. Back in 2005, members of Congress spoke at a level equal to a high school junior. Now, the numbers have dropped off. Congress talks like a bunch of sophomores. Sunlight used something called the "Flesch-Kinkaid" scale to determine speech level. Longer sentences and words with more syllables equal higher grade levels.
Some interesting factoids from the Sunlight Foundation's study:

New footage from Joplin tornadoBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Fri, May 18, 2012Tweet0

Almost a year after a tornado leveled large portions of Joplin, Missouri, new footage from a hospital security camera shows the devastation as it occurred.
St. John's Medical Center was among the most heavily damaged buildings in Joplin. Winds of 200 miles per hour ravaged the interior. The footage shows chairs and tables swept up and tossed against the ceiling and walls. No people appear in the 36 seconds of video.
[Photos: Joplin's tornado one year later]
The tornado and its aftermath killed more than 160 people. On Monday, President Obama will deliver the commencement speech to the graduating class at Joplin High School. A White House press release reads, "The Joplin community's resilience and selflessness in the face of tragedy continues to inspire our nation."
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon will also attend.

Kentucky man buys Kmart inventory, gives it all awayBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Thu, May 17, 2012Tweet0
A Kentucky man purchased every last bit of inventory from a Kmart store that was two days away from shutting its doors. But he didn't keep the stuff for himself. Rankin Paynter gave it all way to a local charity.
Paynter spent a total of $200,000 to buy the goods, which ranged from clothes to office supplies. According to a video from WHDH Boston, Paynter was buying supplies for his business when the idea hit. Paynter asked the cashier what they planned to do with the store's inventory when it closed down. The cashier responded that it would go to "Kmart power buyers."
Paynter became a power buyer, bought up everything, and then gave it away. "To be honest with you, I could have made $30,000-$40,000 on it," he said. Paynter has seen a lot of economic suffering at his jewelry exchange. "What I see is people coming in my store, needy people sell their stuff," Paynter said. "It's bad nowadays. I just told (the clerk) let's just give it away to charity."
Paynter is a successful

Space shuttle Enterprise time-lapse shows painstaking processBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Mon, May 14, 2012Tweet0
Last month, the space shuttle Enterprise arrived at New York City's JFK International Airport on the back of a 747 jumbo jet. Its ultimate destination: The Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in Manhattan.
[Photos: Last journey continues for Enterprise]
NASA recently posted a time-lapse video of the shuttle being removed from the back of the jet. As you might expect, it's a rather painstaking process involving a lot of workers and some impressive machinery. It begins at dusk, lasts all through the night, and finally ends as the sun begins to rise the next morning.

Now that the shuttle is no longer tied to the 747, it will be (gently) placed on a barge and then pulled via tugboat up the Hudson River to the museum. Visitors will be able to check it out starting this summer.

Obama shoots hoops with Clooney and MaguireBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Fri, May 11, 2012Tweet0
President Obama shot some hoops with a couple of superheroes on Friday.
After a Hollywood fundraiser during which the president brought in around $15 million, Obama shot the roundball with George Clooney and Tobey Maguire at a recreation center in Los Angeles.
George Clooney and President Obama
Clooney, for those of you who have scrubbed the memory from your brain, played Batman in 1997's cinematic disaster "Batman and Robin." Maguire played web slinger Spider-Man in three films.
Obama took a good-natured swipe at Clooney. "I want to thank Clooney for letting us use his basketball court. This guy has been talking smack about his basketball game ever since I've known him." No word on who won.

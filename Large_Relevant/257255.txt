Why such drama over an escalator that starting going in reverse? I used to go up escalators for fun. Granted, it will take you a few more seconds to reach the top, but﻿ it's not the end of the world.

I do not understand this...
The people﻿ were all trying to go up, right?
Then at 0:27 you can see that the escalator has been stopped, so why did half the people on it decide to walk all the way to the bottom???
You were almost to the top!!!!! What the fuck are you doing!!!!????!!!

There are a lot of stupid people on here making fun of the individuals on the escalator. They should NOT turn around and walk down the escalator, because there's a mass of people who have no idea it is running backwards, who are trying to get ON it. If you have two crowds of people being forced into the same small area, they will get crushed﻿ and injured. That's what happened. Good thing none of you retards were on there, more people would have been hurt.

This is just﻿ terrible. I mean. An escalator went backwards. It was suppose to go forward. Do they not realize how dangerous it is to go backwards when you're trying to walk forward. It's not like you can turn around and walk back. That's nonsense!!! Impossible!!! Unthinkable!!! Madness!!! Not.

Man, you're an idiot. What happens when you and all the other "smart"﻿ people walk down the escalator straight into a rush-hour crowd of people who are getting on? Everyone at the bottom will get crushed. People will fall down and get trampled. You are a moron and certainly can't criticize people for being irrational.

Yea because the rush hour crowd is dumb enough to not move out the way when they notice the people at the bottom of the escalator are not﻿ able to go up. If you notice.. the people at the bottom of escalator were smart and just stood there instead of trying to walk up while the dumb people at the top were being dumb or trying to get their quick minute exercise.

They could've just gotten off one by one. It's likely one or two people endangered the rest by not just﻿ getting off out of fear. Escalators won't hurt you, stupidity will though.

There's a video entitled "D.C. Escalator Malfunctions Spilling Crowd Into Lobby " on youtube ; should be on this page right top corner. Now in this video, the escalator was going in the right direction but it malfunctioned and causing a﻿ human pile-up. I rest my case.

Ok at first I was as annoyed as most of the people﻿ here thinking "GET OVER IT!!!"....but then I watched again...notice how fast the escalator was heading backwards in essence. With a bustling crowd all herding in the direction of the escalator then having all the folks speed back towards the crowd, someone could have been seriously injured. The person filming was heading down at regular speed so look how MUCH faster the next row shot down! I'm just saying I had to watch again.

The few people at the foot of the escalator could have been thrown off their feet as the escalator suddenly moved backwards. Imagine a few people now on the floor and others are coming towards them. That's the reason the people at the top did not﻿ just stand still but rather continued to climb because they did not want to contribute to a pile-up. Have you ever been at the bottom of a human pile-up ? Where you couldn't breathe ? It's sad that you couldn't see why this was a dangerous situation.

I don't think it's so easy to just turn around and walk other way. Remember that each stair had people on it. So unless everyone did it simultaneously, people would end up pushing people down escalator. Much﻿ more dangerous and idiotic I would think.

You don't understand, we aren't dependent on automated machines, don't be ignorant. The change of direction unto its complementary angle increases pressure and hence, causes spacial incapacity that is what we know as a couple of injuries which cause people money,﻿ time and security. It isn't irrational, but a safer and healthier technology should be in place to replace this one! Good luck, engineers! I really wish to see the city of the future.

Which is the word you don't understand? If you fail to recognize one of﻿ the words in my previous comments, I can only assume you are still in grade school. My native language is not English and I have not taken any English-quiz in years, and I am not trying to "sound smart"..

I know it's called trolling, it's not pissing me off but I am bewildered as to why someone would spend so much﻿ energy on trying to piss other people off? Some mental problem perhaps? Maybe you should see a psychologist rather than pester people online, just saying... My native language is Swedish.

This video absolutely﻿ disgusts me. These people should have all been able to run up the escalator and continue on with their day. The gene pool has become stagnant.

Obviously this is a set up. Someone engineered a genius way to hack an escalator and "injure" themselves. Her comes the lawsuit. Thanks to the camera man no doubt there's money to be had and evidence to award﻿ it with. Maybe the cameraman was in on it too.

To you and all the other people who say something similar:
Are you fucking retarded? Do you not see how fast that escalator is traveling in reverse? That thing was going faster than the actual down escalator.
@Hollywood420123: stop moving their feet﻿ and hit the bottom at nearly 5 MPH. Great idea for a fucking crowd, dipshit.

Problem with most of your logic is that if it were sudden, the people just getting on got crushed by the﻿ ones already going up. So not much time to react when people are coming back down on you quite quickly. And the yelling of stop was likely to get someone to hit the emergency stop button... just saying.

You can tell its America because
1. Almost all the people aren't in good enough shape to actually make it up the escalator when its in reverse
2. No one is smart enough to just do a﻿ 180 and step off at the bottom. Several people injured? Really?

For those who are making fun of these people. I guess it seems funny at first blush, but when you think about the throng of people shoving against them to go up the escalator, it is﻿ easy to see how someone might be trampled/injured. Sort of like in a fire when a door that opens inward traps a bunch of people because of people crowding behind trying to push forward. Ha ha, they can't work a door, stupid people. . . but not really.

People saying just walk up the stairs﻿ are clearly not familiar with the Exchange place PATH and how steep and high of a climb that is. See I used to run up the stairs as a workout in the mornings but god damn my knees would be shaky when I got to the top. I'm young so it's no problem but there's no way those older folks and the out of shape office workers can ever climb up those stairs

I understand that there was people injured and I hope they get well, but WTF is everybody's malfunction.﻿ The escalator starts going down so you don't move and when you get to the bottom you leave. How people got so seriously injured is beyond me.

If the elevator all of a sudden starts going the wrong way and you can't back up when you get to the bottom I because other ppl were trying to get on , it doesn't make the﻿ escalator stop from piling up everybody at the bottom !

What's up with all the comments saying this is no big deal or﻿ just take the stairs? If an escalator changes directions while you're on it, you can easily lose your balance and fall, especially if you're carrying a child on your arms. This resulted in several injuries.

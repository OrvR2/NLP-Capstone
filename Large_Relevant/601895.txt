WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House says a court ruling that President Barack Obama violated the Constitution by making recess appointments to a labor panel won't affect the president's other personnel actions.
White House press secretary Jay Carney says the administration strongly disagrees with the decision. He's calling it novel and unprecedented, but also disputing that it could impede Obama's pick for head of a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
The White House isn't saying whether it will appeal Friday's ruling by a three-judge federal appeals court panel. Carney says the Justice Department will have to answer that question.
The panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said earlier Friday that Obama didn't have the power to fill vacancies on the National Labor Relations Board because the Senate was still in session. Presidents have used recess appointments to bypass Senate opposition.

I would love to have been there and watched Obama's face turn a bright RED when he heard that the Judge and ruled against him.

The Democrats and Obama are playing with fire ala letting illegals have citizenship, pandering to the LGBT special interests, ignoring the nations indignation on killing babies in the womb, and last but not least trying to undermine the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution !!! I bet they will get a wake-up call in the '14 interim elections and in the '16 general election as the pendulum swings back toward the center from their left-leaning-liberal progressive agenda...

And his boy Rahm Emanuel just attempted to pressure bank of America and td bank to suspend the credit lines of smith and wesson and ruger for no reason except that emanuel disagree's with them politically. Really? Is this the hope and change you people envisioned? Chicago gangsta's every one of them.

Candidate Obama, March 30, 2007:
"I was a constitutional law professor, which means unlike the current president I actually respect the Constitution." 

The truth is that his title was "Lecturer", but none-the-less, he violated his oath of office.

You are much smarter than the president and you enunciate so clearly. 

You want lawyers for terrorists…I'm sorry, insurgents, oh yeah, freedom fighters. Tokyo Rosie said "Don't fear the terrorists, they are mothers and fathers too." You want to shut down Guantanamo Bay. After all we are torturing the poor defenseless terrorists. Bring them here. Give them an ACLU lawyer. 

The Democratic Party is the new home of anti-Semitism in our time (impossible, you are still liberals). But the appeasement policies of the Democratic Party and the activism of the New Left, which your party is now beholden to, (Michael Moore, George Soros, Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon, Cindy Sheehan, MoveOn.org, Daily Kos, Code Pink, World Can't Wait) enable our enemy both here and abroad -- radical Islam. International A.N.S.W.E.R. and Code Pink openly hate Israel. But you attend all of the peace demonstrations sponsored by these groups. Did you know that the International Socialist Workers Party funds International A.N.S.W.E.R.? Nice company you're keeping. 

Your carbon footprint is small…unless you are John Travolta and Arianna Huffington flying around on private jets, or Al Gore and John Edwards who own mansions big enough to land planes in. You are walking to all of those peace demonstrations in canvas shoes, aren't you? Have you swapped out all of your incandescent light bulbs yet? 

You want higher taxes. You want all of my money. Because you care. You just want to help the disadvantaged…forever. A hand up, not a handout, right? However, if you're rich enough you can hide your money in Belize like Ted Kennedy and still call for higher taxes. 

You are, in short, a bunch of useful idiots. You've bought into the liberal lie -- hook, line and sinker. 

The ultimate leftist/communist and social fascist Lenin described the "useful idiot" as those people living in liberal democracies who, by giving moral and material support to a totalitarian ideology, were "braiding the rope that would hang them

Why people who enjoy freedom and prosperity would work passionately to destroy both is a fascinating question, one still with us today. Today's useful idiots can be found in the unending chorus of appeasement in the 'guilt-ridden hate America first' crowd, and in the naive idealism that prevents our necessary responses to the latest and most fashionable flavor of freedom-hating ideology, Islamic fascism. The list is a long one...too long to mention here. One only needs to look at Round One and Two of the Neville Awards to see the useful idiots of our own era. But there are many others, going back to the 1920's and 1930's who paved the way for our current crop of leftist political and social "geniuses." 

For liberals to win national office the United States must fail economically and politically. When the going gets tough you are ready to cut and run. You are invested in defeat and you own surrender because you hate yourself and this country. Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid declares "The war is lost". And reminiscent of Chamberlain's infamous Munich meeting with Hitler, "Damascus" Nanci Pelosi returned from Syria for "talks" with Assad. In an eerie "peace for our time" Neville Chamberlain moment she declared "the road to Damascus is a road to peace". She is a useful idiot. The Muslim enemy smiles to your face and laughs at your back. 

Newly elected Democrats are voting for meaningless anti-war resolutions and surrender timetables knowing they will be vetoed because they don't have the guts for an up or down vote to cut off war funding. That would be political suicide no matter who was president. But you support the troops…gotta love those brave boys (and girls) in uniform…so long as you don't actually use them. As a liberal you might have to commit to something painfulReply

Yes! It was 'novel and unprecedented'! As was, Obama's action of making the appointments, in the 1st place. THAT, is why it was ruled 'unConstitutional'(By the by, Yahoo'News' 'editors', WHY does your SpellCheck claim that that word is misspelled, when it is not? To discourage people from using, you 'press' hacks?). And, surprise, surprise, Obama is 'going to ignore it, and go right on doing what HE wants to do, the wishes of the people', and 'the legality of it', bedammed. Really? ARE you surprised?

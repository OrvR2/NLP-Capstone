What is that on top of what looks like the bible that he has his hand on at 0.25? AND
What does he stutter at "United States"? He doesn't say "states" but it looks like his lips said something else. People will say he stuttered, but look at his lips when he "stutters".﻿ Very strange.

First, Youtube was free of any ads whatsoever. Next, we started to notice small ads in corners and shuffled into videos but never did they intrude on us. Next, the ads began to play when we selected a video but they allowed us to "skip" ad in 5 or 7 seconds. Now, we click a video and are FORCED to watch a 30﻿ second commercial without being able to skip! Next will be ads on EVERY VIDEO we want to watch. Somebody always has to milk that stinking cash cow. Nothing is free in this filthy world.

What is states reveals the truth. The tables have turned since the times of segregation. It's like African-Americans can literally use any racist reference, slur, action against us but if we portray any type of way in defending ourselves we get the black card thrown at us. African-Americans are now the recipients of every ammendment given in the Constitution whereas us﻿ whites are gradually losing one right after another until we're the ones who will be considered "minorities" or "crackers".

Percentage of Blacks is way higher on Government Hand-out than percentage of﻿ Whites.

White countries are being flooded by non-whites. Whites are told to be TOLERANT. Whites are forced to integrate.

With assimilation we see the extinction of one race only, the White race. It's﻿ not funny, not comedy, it's white genocide.
When White people bring light to this though, we are called racist.

somehow this could be prevented because a guy in Kentucky, name Skeeter, has a﻿ 22. His friends, who are buying guns to protect the other guns, are sitting on the porch, chewing tobacco drooling all over themselves, while waiting for Obama's Negro army to confiscate their weapons and get all Django unchained on your ass

Violating the constitution? These right idiots couldn't be more wrong. The NRA types actually believe that what protects their rights isn't laws or courts. It's that they have a gun and that alone, will keep the government from going too far and without﻿ guns, Obama would become emperor & force everyone to gay marry.

RemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock User




dkyelak



That is interesting- 30 bucks for a firearm. Goes to show how takers of that offer value their self defense weapons. It is their choice to take up the offer though- I wouldn't. Maybe it's good that those individuals do so since they don't seem serious about gun ownership or self protection in the first place- they might be the ones to have their weapons taken and used against them in a tense situation. Again- they﻿ chose to give up their weapons.




RemoveReport profile imageFlag for spamBlock UserUnblock User

They don't choose to give up their weapons, they are just﻿ "afraid". After all, Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to Hate. Hate leads to Suffering.

We can start simple. Try any widely-circulated newspaper. If you bothered reading one, the Wall Street Journal for example, you'd know Obama took the Oath on the MLK Jr. Bible (which both he and conservative Chief Justice Roberts inscribed) and the Lincoln bible - not the Qur'an.
Instead you choose to remain stupid and ignorant and make up wild conspiracies (like﻿ Obama being a secret Muslim) to scare the hell out of yourself. It's backwood idiots like you who hurt the Republican Party.

Ex-foster child testifies in Mass. class actionBy DENISE LAVOIE | Associated Press – Tue, Jan 22, 2013

BOSTON (AP) — Beginning at age 8, Lauren James bounced among at least 14 different foster homes, along the way being forced to scrub floors, clean up after dogs, miss meals and take up to five psychiatric mediations at a time.
Now 24, she was the opening witness Tuesday in a case aimed at putting the Massachusetts foster care system on trial.
The federal class-action lawsuit was filed in 2010 by Children's Rights, a New York-based child advocacy group that alleges that thousands of children in state foster care are being abused and neglected. The group claims the state Department of Children and Families has violated the constitutional rights of children by placing them in unstable and sometimes dangerous situations.
James described a turbulent childhood marked by the death of her father just before her 6th birthday and her mother's suicide when she was 12. She said she was shuttled between foster homes and sent to live with her mother between ages 8 and 11. Then, after her mother died, she hopped from foster home to foster home.
In most of the homes, she wasn't given enough to eat, and her weight dropped from 100 pounds to 73 pounds, she said.
In one home, she was forced by the foster parents to do a lot of housecleaning, including scrubbing floors on her hands and knees and cleaning up after six Chihuahuas, she said.
In another home, her foster parents made fun of her biological mother, James said. At one point, while she was grieving her mother's death, her foster parents told her that her father had "killed himself because he didn't want you," she said.
James said she often felt depressed but didn't express her feelings to her case workers very often. She said she was always told there were not enough foster homes.
"Really, it doesn't matter because they can't do anything about it," she said.
James said she was given lithium beginning at age 6.
"I remember them saying that because my father had bipolar, I was predisposed to it," she said.
After that, she said, she was put on various psychiatric medications, up to five at once. She said the medications made her feel "absolutely dreadful" and caused her to develop sleep problems. At one point, after she was given a new drug to take, she gained 45 pounds in three or four weeks, she said.
Under cross-examination from Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Collins, James acknowledged she first began taking psychiatric medication before she was ever placed in foster care. She acknowledged that both her biological mother and father had spent time in psychiatric hospitals. She also said a boyfriend her mother had after her father's death was sometimes violent and abusive.
She said she herself spent time in a psychiatric hospital as a child and was diagnosed over the years with various mental illnesses, including oppositional defiant disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and reactive-attachment disorder.
She acknowledged that the state had provided services intended to stabilize her family and allow her to remain at home with her mother, but that the services did not work, she said.
Collins asked James whether she blamed DCF, at least in part, for her mother's suicide.
"I don't blame anyone for my mother's death except my mother," she said.
She also said her mother had spent 4½ years of her childhood in foster care.
"With that cycle, I have inherited things that I despise and that the Department of Children and Families has not truly helped to fix, to help mend," she said.
The lawsuit seeks reforms on behalf of approximately 7,500 children in foster care in Massachusetts. The non-jury trial is being heard by U.S. District Judge William Young.
A lawyer for DCF told Young that the department has increased the number of children being safely cared for at home, with about 2,000 fewer children in foster care than just a few years ago.

It's not that the foster care/welfare system in this country is 'too big to fail'. It's that it is too big and damaged to fix as it is. We need to scrap the whole system and start over. Generations of families on welfare, drugs, participating in crimes and having children who are unwillingly thrust into a system that cares nothing for their general welfare is only one of the largest embarassments to this country.

How hard could it be to check up on foster homes and stop these things from happening???? It would make more sense to go back to large orphanages that cared for and schooled these kids. They need shelter from people that are only after the money. Isn't safety more important than a 'homey' feeling?!

I think it was about more than that "homey" feeling:  orphanages weren't know for handling the children under their care all that well, either.

The System could work except for the lazy#$%$ regulators/administrators and politicians. Everything happening in the 21st Century America is currently covered by an abundance of Law. But governmental agencies rarely follow through when it comes to the destitute and most vulnerable.

I worked as a licensing agent for foster homes, then a foster care worker, and finally, a protective services worker before I got so sickened by what I saw that I now work in law enforcement.  There are SO MANY facets to this particular area that it would be impossible to hang my hat on one sole cause for the problems with foster care. First: the parents are damaged by their own destuctive childhoods, which lead to (name it: drug abuse /seeking abusive people to emotionally latch onto/poverty -pick one, or, all), which leads to neglect and/or abuse, which leads to removal. The kids are damaged because they have (fill in the blank), and no matter HOW horrid their childhoods were, they seek out the biological parents at around 16, thus starting the whole cycle over again. The foster parents are overwhelmed beyond belief and there are NOT ENOUGH of them. Not by a long shot. No matter how you look at it, the kids are screwed. There is NO ANSWER, and as sensational as it is to see former foster kids suing the State, the ONLY one to blame is the PARENTS who were responsible for their offspring to begin with.

There are horrible foster care homes all over the country. Children being diagnosed and medicated for normal emotions that are not being treated properly. These children are not allowed to grieve they are simply doped up. I had talked to a family member once about being part of the foster care system and housing children in my home. I was shocked by their reaction, they thought about doing it also but not to care for them but to get free help on their farm. If she thinks like that then I'm sure there are many more like her that want workers and not children.

I know an older man who lived in an orphanage first and them was transferred to a foster home.  He said that at leas int heorphanage you knew where you were going to sleep at night and that you would have the same people taking care of you.

After Newtown: Video games, the US military, and America's culture of violenceGabrielle Giffords made a compelling plea at the Senate hearings on gun control today, but the National Rifle Association's Wayne LaPierre is also partly right: Banning guns won’t address a pervasive culture of violence that doesn't distinguish between real and virtual violence.By John Sanbonmatsu | Christian Science Monitor – Wed, Jan 30, 2013

Whatever else is said about the murder of 20 elementary school children in Newtown, Conn. last year, let no one say – especially at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on gun control today – that those killings were “unimaginable.” Every day, mass killings are imagined, rehearsed, and enacted – virtually – by millions of children and young adults, mostly boys and men, in video games like Bioshock 2. That game invites players to murder defenseless, cowering girls at point-blank range or lure them into a trap to mow them down with a machine gun.
Adam Lanza didn’t have to imagine the Sandy Hook massacre on his own. Others had already imagined it for him.
When Wayne LaPierre, head of the National Rifle Association, pointed a finger at video games and media violence during a news conference after the shootings, it was a calculated effort to distract attention from the gun industry and its powerful lobby. As former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly wrote in their USA Today op-ed announcing the launch of their gun-control superPAC, "We saw from the NRA leadership's defiant and unsympathetic response to the Newtown, Conn., massacre that winning even the most common-sense reforms will require a fight."
But Mr. LaPierre was also half right. Glock and Bushmaster give troubled teens and young adults like Lanza the means to kill. But antisocial video games and a wider culture of militarism give them the script.
OPINION: 6 reasons why President Obama will defeat the NRA and win universal background checks 
What LaPierre neglected to say is that the arms industry, the video game industry, and the military are deeply entwined with one another and even, one could argue, allied in values. In many ways, their work together is eroding the distinction between virtual and real killing.
During the Iraq War, Marines relaxed after conducting search and destroy missions by playing Call of Duty 4 and CounterStrike, fielding the same weapons and tactics. CIA agents and Air Force personnel today kill real people in distant countries using remotely piloted drones, on interfaces modeled on video games, while US soldiers hone tactical combat skills on video game simulators and use Xbox joysticks to control real machines in the battlefield.
Meanwhile, the video game industry works closely with the military and gun manufacturers to ensure that their virtual weaponry, from the PM-63 submachine gun to the C-130 gunship, behaves just like the real thing. Some game companies have direct contracts with the Department of Defense, manufacturing hardware and software for military applications.
It’s easy to see why the US Army runs recruitment ads in gamer magazines and maintains a popular online game called America’s Army.
While the industry denies any link between violent interactive media and real-world beliefs and behaviors, studies have shown that playing violent video games is associated with higher rates of hostility, more pro-violence attitudes, and a decrease in players’ ability to empathize with others, particularly those who are suffering.
Computer video games are in fact the most powerful medium ever devised for altering perception and behavior. That’s why psychologists use them to help patients overcome post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) why pilots are trained on flight simulators, and why the military uses them to train soldiers.
So what does it mean that millions of boys and young men are spending their free time “training” to kill?
Whether knifing or setting fire to prostitutes in Grand Theft Auto, or mowing down scores of racially stereotyped Arabs in some fictional Middle Eastern country, male video-game players are being taught to associate representations of mass slaughter, torture, and other antisocial acts with play and pleasure. They are being told that to be a “real” man is to come to others heavily armed.
OPINION: The moral cost of video games
The very idea of moving from room to room with an assault weapon, “clearing” the room by shooting victims in the head, as Lanza did in Newtown, is a convention of the First Person Shooter video game genre. The first such game, Doom, proved so successful at teaching soldiers how to kill that the Marines quickly adapted it for their training program. Prior to their massacre, the Columbine killers spent countless hours playing and even designing levels on a modified version of the same game.
At his trial last year, Anders Breivik, the Norwegian extremist who murdered 69 people, most of them teenagers, on the island of Utoya, boasted that he had done his weapons training on the military-style First Person Shooter game, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which he had played for up to 16 hours a day as “part of my training-simulation.” The special gun sight Breivik installed on his rifle was the real version of the virtual one he had used in the game.
The Breivik case reveals how narrow the US debate over gun violence really is. Norway has stringent gun control laws, and Breivik did his killing with a hunting rifle, not a semi-automatic assault rifle. So tightening restrictions on guns, in a nation that already has hundreds of millions of them in private hands, is both admirable and arguably beside the point. Banning guns alone won’t address a pervasive culture of militarism and violence – one that has diminished the ability of children and young adults to distinguish between real and virtual violence, or to care about the difference.
Despite a landmark Supreme Court decision in 2011, which protected commercial video games as free speech, the Newtown massacre has renewed debate in the Congress and White House over what, if anything, should – or can – be done to regulate the $60 billion video game industry, the largest media business in the world.
To his credit, President Obama recently ordered more federal research on possible links between violent video games and real-life violence, and asked Congress to fund it. But he declined to take stronger action.
Two weeks ago, Vice President Joe Biden, who had earlier expressed concern about violent video games, suddenly backed down, after intense lobbying pressure from the industry. He and others seem to have accepted the industry's position that the research linking violent video games to real violence is too "inconclusive" to justify new legislative action.  
The industry is fond of saying that no one has yet been able to prove that a specific act of violence was "caused" by someone playing a video game.  However, that's like my claiming that cars don't contribute to global warming, because no one has proved that my own SUV has caused the glaciers on Kilimanjaro to melt. The sources of climate change, and of violence, are in fact multiple. Video games may not cause violence on their own, but they contribute to a culture of violence by modeling antisocial acts and diminishing players' empathic response to others.
They also promote a virulent militarism that subordinates democratic and civic values to a culture of war-making. And here, perhaps, lies the rub. A cynic might ask whether a deliberative body that routinely authorizes billions of dollars for real-world weapons, real-life wars that in just the last decade have left more than 100,000 real people, not virtual ones, dead, is terribly likely to go after an industry that spreads only make-believe violence.
Let us give our elected representatives the benefit of the doubt, and assume that they would. Even so, it is not far-fetched to ask whether our representatives' reluctance to rein in the industry might not stem, at least in part, from their tacit appreciation of how deeply entwined cultures of symbolic violence now are with our national identity and self-understanding as a great military power.
EDITOR'S BLOG: After Aurora: the role of media violence
Yet a nation that lives by the sword dies by it, and it matters less and less whether that sword is virtual or real. So long as America continues socializing its young people in a culture of violence and war, whether in video games or in military campaigns abroad, we are unlikely to see an end to tragedies like Newtown or Aurora.

Ok, I find this highly offensive and very misleading.  I am a soldier and I served in Iraq, Peru and Afghanistan (currently). I have been shot in the abdomen twice (my vest catching both rounds) and awarded the Bronze star and Purple heart. I grew up playing video games of all forms, violent and non. I joined the military not because I was violent, but because I came from a middle class family with a long military history. Video games, hunting, riflery, were some of the pieces that defined who I am.  I have served now for ten years and I have not once thought about going into some school or mall and randomly killing innocent people. Most healthy people dont, and those that ever think that have some form of mental illness, impulse control issues, or just plain neglected/bullied as children. Most of my gaming friends and soldiers in the 75th would also find this offensive and misleading.  I was close friends in basic training with Nidal Hasan who shot the troops in texas. He was an exception and he had emotional issues even back when we met.  He never touched a video game but once and said they were a waste of time.  So from that personal experience, you can pull out facts anywhere to support your claims. Obama just funneled money to the CDC to research a link between gaming and violence, now why would he do that? UCLA medical, Yale, Harvard, and Duke have already pursued the numbers on this indepth. But the answer would have to overwhelmingly be, the data does not support his agenda.  Video games have proven to lower aggression by providing stress relief to healthy individuals, increase hand eye coordination, and has been proven to even help relief PHYSICAL PAIN in burn wards across the country and in pediatrics.  I find that prescription medicines written by DOCTORS are far more dangerous to the public than a game could ever hope to be.  It is a failure of the yuppie mom and dad (if there is one) to spend time with their kid and guide them, to teach them life skills, like how to cope and deal with emotional issues and real world problems.  If you wish to lay blame, lay it on the shoulders of things that dumb down our culture like the constant stupidity of Mtv shows like Jersey Shore, the shallowness and misbehavior of some youtube stars, and the parents that think money equals happiness and that you can buy your kids love with stuff.

Really? Did the author even play Bioshock 2? At no point do you lure little sisters into traps and mow them down with machine guns...at least try to keep it in the realm of truth.

If you suddenly feel the insatiable urge to go out and murder people after playing some CoD, perhaps the CoD isn't really the problem.  Call me crazy, but I think there are far deeper underlying factors than video games.

1. The Little Sisters in BioShock have been genetically engineered to harvest life-force from corpses; they're not ordinary children.
2. The player doesn't have to kill them, he/she can save them. 
Good grief, I'm 62 years old and female, hardly a "typical gamer", and even I know that much. Did these people even look at the game?

No laws are going to stop the deranged and the evil that walk amongst us, the current laws were enough to stop the Lanza and Spengler, to name a few. The proposed laws would still not have stopped them.  All the proposed and recent NY legislation does is punish the law abiding. We did not do Newtown, or Webster, and yet we are being treated as such.

In Dead Space, you are invited to eviscerate babies.  Sure, they are evil, genetically modified mutants trying to kill you, but they look like babies..... I thought we were through with this retarded argument in the 80s and 90s.  Oh my, Mortal Kombat has simulated blood fly when you punch, boo hoo.  Boo hoo.

Culture of violence: Breivik is a perfect example of why this is a retarded argument: he used a hunting rifle, but that's okay because Norway has very tight gun control policies.  No, that's not okay.  The point is that if you're going to commit a crime, you use what you get.  In Britain, they've got tight gun control as well, but they also have a ridiculous number of stabbings.  Why?  Tough to get guns, but knives are everywhere.  Then let's argue for knife control.

When you argue this badly, you're just setting your side up to lose.

Attention psychopaths!  Do not do anything crazy around the time of the GTA V release!  I don't want them screwing with what is going to be the most epic game ever released on Earth the planet.  I'm serious.  I will tell the voices in your heads to harass you day and night if you are even thinking about messing this game up for us.

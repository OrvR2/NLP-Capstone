Blog Posts by Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Cop taunts teen suspect after wrestling him to ground (VIDEO)By Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Mon, Nov 26, 2012Tweet0

[Updated at 1:10 p.m. ET]
It's the kind of taunt worthy of a flag for excessive celebration.
But the man confronting the camera is no NFL star; he's a suburban Dallas police officer.
After allegedly kneeing, then cursing and cuffing a teenage suspect, Officer Disraeli Arnold boasts to the video being recorded by the arrested teen's friend.
"You got it on tape?" the officer shouts, before giving his name and badge number. "Arnold ... Six fifty-four!"
The Hurst Police Department announced Monday that Arnold has been put on leave pending an ongoing internal affairs investigation.
"Obviously, this is not behavior that the City of Hurst and the Hurst Police Department promotes or condones in any way," the department wrote on its Facebook page. "We strive to build a stronger, safer community through our work around the city and will continue to do so through appropriate action.  We appreciate everyone's thoughts and continued civil discourse as the investigation is conducted."

The germiest place on an airplane? It’s right in front of youBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Tue, Nov 20, 2012Tweet0

Thought the weirdo in the window seat was your biggest worry? Think again.
The CBS news station in Dallas checked the cleanliness of airplanes on two recent flights. The CBS 11 investigation revealed all sorts of ick. Serratia, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter were just a few of the bacteria strands stowed away around passengers.
"Nasty stuff," one traveler told the TV station.
Reporter Ginger Allen randomly swabbed several areas on the planes and found filth on lavatory door handles and table trays.
"But the grossest of all came from right here ... in the seat pocket," Allen showed in her report. (Note to self on where not to put mints or mobile phones, huh?)
Fortunately, Dallas doctor Cedric Spak told CBS 11 that the bacteria it found on the airplanes are fairly normal and not harmful to a healthy person. To avoid airplane germs, Spak and other doctors advise travelers to wash their hands, use hand sanitizer and allow the air vents to blow above their seat.

Fresno workplace shooting leaves three dead, two injuredBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Tue, Nov 6, 2012Tweet0

[Updated at 5 p.m. ET]
The death toll now stands at three from this morning's workplace shooting at a Fresno, Calif., meat processing plant.
Police say Lawrence Jones, 42, a discharged parolee shot four coworkers before shooting himself about 8:30 a.m. at Valley Protein, which makes poultry products.
Two victims and the gunman have died. Two others remain hospitalized.
"We're still trying to determine what provoked these actions," Police Chief Jerry Dyer told reporters at a news conference.
The Fresno Bee said the shooter had worked at the plant for 14 months. Employees told investigators that Jones, "did not appear to be himself when he came to work." Chief Dyer said the man was more than three hours into his shift when he pulled a handgun and began shooting. An estimated 60 people were at the business at the time of the shooting.
The Fresno Bee spoke to witnesses who saw factory workers running from the plant. Roger Medina told the newspaper that he was in a nearby McDonald's when a

Retired Boy Scouts executive defends his work as keeper of secret sex filesBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Mon, Nov 5, 2012Tweet0

Paul Ernst appears to be your average mild-mannered accountant type, but look past the glasses and the tie, and you'll find a man once tasked with the job of playing morals cop for the Boy Scouts of America.
For more than two decades, if a troop suspected that a child molester was among them, Ernst was the guy to tell. From 1971 to 1993, when he retired, Ernst was officially the BSA's national director of registration, subscriptions and statistical services—maintaining membership rosters, producing stats for annual reports and keeping the books on Boys' Life magazine subscriptions. But he also had the unpleasant task of being point man for the Boy Scouts' "perversion files," a secret system started around 1920 to try and keep unfit leaders out of the institution's ranks.
Ernst regularly received letters from across the country. They detailed despicable acts by adult staffers and volunteers, and requested the men be banished from the BSA's rolls:
"indecent liberties with a child."

Live-blog replay: Superstorm Sandy pummels New York City, northeast U.S.By Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Tue, Oct 30, 2012Tweet0
[Updated at 5:10 p.m. ET]
At least a 40 people are reportedly dead and millions of homes and businesses are without power after the former Hurricane Sandy barreled into the northeast Atlantic coast. Heavy rains and a record storm surge flooded streets and subways in Lower Manhattan and caused scores of people to have to be rescued in multiple states. The now-weakened storm, estimated to be nearly 1,000 miles wide, is forecast to move to the Great Lakes before swinging north into Canada over the next few days.

[Updated @ 11:50 p.m. CT]
DALLAS - Firefighters rescued two dozen people who were stranded in midair late Friday on the Stratosphere swing ride at the State Fair of Texas.
No injuries were reported, but witnesses told Dallas media outlets that the riders dangled in their chairs for two hours.
"Loud applause as Stratosphere makes its way down to the ground," KXAS-TV reporter Ellen Goldberg wrote in a tweet at 11:22 p.m.
"All 24 riders are safely on the ground," Dallas police posted on Facebook at 11:30 p.m. "Riders have been reunited with their families and friends."
The spinning ride reaches as high as 200 feet above the ground, according to DallasNews.com.
Dallas news station CBS 11 said the ordeal began about 9 p.m. CT when the ride lost power.
It's been an eventful day at the nation's largest state fair. Friday morning, Big Tex, the fair's 52-foot iconic cowboy statue went up in flames.

Iconic Big Tex catches fire in DallasBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Fri, Oct 19, 2012Tweet0

"Big Tex is burning to the ground because of an electrical short! (sad face)"
Do what?!?! I blurted out in my native Texas tongue. My wife's alarming text message caught me off guard, but she attached a picture to prove the tragedy.
There he was, the towering 60-year-old icon of the State Fair of Texas, lit up like a bonfire.
Early word from authorities is that the 52-foot-tall cowboy who welcomed fair-goers with a booming "Howdy, folks" likely suffered an electrical short in his motorized parts.
No one on the ground was reportedly injured, but dozens of Texans stood in awe, snapping photos of the symbolic structure going down in flames. It must have been a gut-wrenching sight.
The State Fair of Texas is the largest in the U.S., and the notorious home of such delicacies as fried butter and fried bacon cinnamon rolls.
He only visits once a year during the fair, but the big fella is as famous as Willie Nelson, Nolan Ryan and other notable Texans.
A mourner quickly posted a touching

Boy Scouts secret file resurrects past abuse for victimBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Thu, Oct 18, 2012Tweet0
From the BSA's ineligble volunteer file on Curtis Knarich. Click image to view the full report.
[Updated at 4:20 p.m. ET]
PORTLAND, ORE. — Time and trauma have robbed John Buckland of many childhood memories, but he still vividly remembers the night police appeared at his family's home in the summer of 1984.
"They knocked while we were having dinner," recalls Buckland, who was 14 at the time.
The detectives at the front door were armed with lewd photos of boys they had confiscated from Curtis Knarich, Buckland's Boy Scouts troop leader.
"My picture was in those folders," he said. "He had taken pictures of me and tons of other victims."
The crimes occurred at Travis Air Force Base in California where the Buckland family was stationed. Knarich, then 24, was a sergeant and a volunteer assistant scoutmaster.
Months after police came to Buckland's door, Knarich pled guilty to sexually molesting him and 12 other boys. He was shipped off to Fort Leavenworth federal prison.
The Scouts quietly added Knarich to its secret list of ineligible volunteers, but apparently never contacted the

Boy Scouts’ confidential abuse files go online next weekBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Fri, Oct 12, 2012Tweet0
Boy Scouts of America national headquarters in Irving, Texas (Jason Sickles/Yahoo!)
The public will get an unprecedented look inside the Boy Scouts of America next week when more than 14,500 pages of previously confidential documents concerning alleged child sexual abuse within the organization are released.
Against the Scouts' wishes, the Oregon Supreme Court ordered the so-called perversion files to be disclosed four months ago. Since then, attorneys have been redacting the names and contact information for child abuse victims and those who reported the abuse, per the court's order.
The law firm of O'Donnell, Clark & Crew and attorney Paul Mones will put the files online after a press conference in Portland, Ore., on Thursday.
The confidential files are from 1965 to 1985 and represent reports of boys allegedly abused by more than 1,200 different scoutmasters and other adult volunteers.
They were introduced as evidence by the BSA in a 2010 court case involving an Oregon man who was abused as a boy by a scoutmaster. He was awarded nearly $20 million.

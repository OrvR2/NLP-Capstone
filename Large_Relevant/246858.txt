Opinion - Ann Coulter
RUBIO'S AMNESTY: A PATH TO OBLIVION FOR THE GOPAnn Coulter - Wed, Jan 30, 2013Apart from finding out that Barack Obama did far worse in his re-election than nearly any other incumbent who won re-election, the only thing that perked me up after Nov. 6 was coming across a Time magazine published after the 2004 election, when George W. Bush won a second term.In the mirror image of all the 2012 post-election analyses, the Democrats were said to be finished, out of ideas, hopelessly unpopular. It's like watching MSNBC, with the word "Democrats" replaced with "Republicans. ...

The bad news is that they also have no intention of passing any legislation about the mentally ill, which would actually do something to reduce these mass shootings.Instead, the Democrats will jawbone about "assault weapons" and other meaningless gun laws for the sole purpose of scaring soccer moms into hating the National Rifle Association. Expect to hear a lot about Republicans preferring "the gun lobby" to "children. ...

He stalked three women and, at one point, went totally silent, refusing to speak even to his roommates. ...

She based this on evidence that would never be permitted in any other context at the Times: (1) anecdotal observations; and (2) bald assertions of an activist, blandly repeated with absolutely no independent fact-checking by the Times. ...

And let's face it, Kwanzaa's gotten way too commercialized.A few years ago, I suspended my annual Kwanzaa column because my triumph over this fake holiday seemed complete. The only people still celebrating Kwanzaa were presidential-statement writers and white female public school teachers.But it seems to be creeping back. A few weeks ago, House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ...

More »WE KNOW HOW TO STOP SCHOOL SHOOTINGSTAX RICH LIBERALSAnn Coulter - Wed, Dec 12, 2012Republicans have been forced into a Hobson's choice of either letting the Bush tax cuts expire for everyone or agreeing to a tax hike on the top 2 percent of income earners (not to be confused with "the rich," who have already made, inherited or married their money).If Republicans object to the Democrats' hitting job creators with a tax hike, three things will happen: Taxes will go up for everyone; Republicans will be seen as the "party of the rich"; and the inevitable economic collapse will be blamed on Republicans. ... More »TAX RICH LIBERALSAMERICA NEARS EL TIPPING POINTOAnn Coulter - Wed, Dec 5, 2012I apologize to America's young people, whose dashed dreams and dim employment prospects I had laughed at, believing these to be a direct result of their voting for Obama.On closer examination, it turns out that young voters, aged 18-29, overwhelmingly supported Romney. But only the white ones.According to Pew Research, 54 percent of white voters under 30 voted for Romney and only 41 percent for Obama. That's the same percentage Reagan got from the entire white population in 1980. Even the Lena Dunham demographic -- white women under 30 -- slightly favored Romney. ... More »AMERICA NEARS EL TIPPING POINTOMAKE THE DEMOCRATS OWN THE OBAMA ECONOMYAnn Coulter - Wed, Nov 28, 2012One bright spot of Barack Obama's re-election was knowing that unemployment rates were about to soar for the precise groups that voted for him -- young people, unskilled workers and single women with degrees in gender studies. But now the Democrats are sullying my silver lining by forcing Republicans to block an utterly pointless tax-raising scheme in order to blame the coming economic Armageddon on them.Democrats are proposing to reinstate the Bush tax cuts for everyone ... except "the rich. ... More »MAKE THE DEMOCRATS OWN THE OBAMA ECONOMYROMNEY WAS NOT THE PROBLEMAnn Coulter - Wed, Nov 21, 2012Small minds always leap to the answers given the last time around, which is probably why Maxine Waters keeps getting re-elected. But the last time is not necessarily the same as this time. A terrorist attack is not the same as the Cold War, a war in Afghanistan is not the same as a war in Iraq, and Mitt Romney is not the same as John McCain or Bob Dole. ... More »ROMNEY WAS NOT THE PROBLEMDEMOGRAPHY IS DESTINYAnn Coulter - Wed, Nov 14, 2012Liberals brag about having won the hearts and minds of America, as if, through logic and argument, they've persuaded people to accept their bankrupt European socialist ideas.Democrats haven't changed anyone's mind. They changed the people.More white people voted for Mitt Romney this year than voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980. Barack Obama lost white voters by 20 points -- the widest margin since 1984.But in 1980, whites were 88 percent of the electorate. In 2012, they were 72 percent of the electorate. Not only that, but the non-white electorate is far more Democratic than it was in 1980. ... More »DEMOGRAPHY IS DESTINYDON'T BLAME ROMNEYAnn Coulter - Wed, Nov 7, 2012We spent billions of dollars and billions of words on an election to switch from President Obama, a Democratic Senate and a Republican House to President Obama, a Democratic Senate and a Republican House.Every election predictor was wrong, except one: Incumbents usually win.Republicans have taken out a sitting president only once in the last century, and that was in 1980 when Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter. Sadly, Reagan's record remains secure.The Democrats ran up against the incumbency problem in 2004. ... More »DON'T BLAME ROMNEYROMNEY IS WHAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS NOWAnn Coulter - Thu, Nov 1, 2012The single most important issue in this election is ending the national nightmare of Obamacare.If Obamacare if not stopped, it will permanently change the political culture of this country. There will be no going back. America will become a less productive, less wealthy nation. What wealth remains will have to be plowed into Obamacare -- to the delight only of the tens of thousands of government bureaucrats administering it.There won't be one moment marking the end of America. ...

My only date on this rainy Tuesday night is Chris Matthews -- the last liberal left who will still talk to me about race.The rest of the Non-Fox Media are lying in wait, hoping I'll disappear so they can revive the old chestnuts about racist Republicans again.Among many such myths, there's Reagan's Philadelphia speech, George W. Bush's speech at Bob Jones University, someone yelling "Kill him" at the mention of Barack Obama's name at a Sarah Palin rally, tea partiers calling Rep. ... More »OBAMA: HALF-BLACK BUT ALL DEMOCRATGOT RACISM?Ann Coulter - Wed, Oct 10, 2012Liberal racism sightings have become like a lunatic's version of "Where's Waldo?" Kevin Baker of Harper's magazine says Romney's referring to his "five boys" in last week's debate was how he "slyly found a way" to call Obama a "boy." Says Baker: "How the right's hard-core racists must have howled at that!"MSNBC's Chris Matthews says the word "apartment" is racist because black people live in apartments. He also says the word "Chicago" is racist because -- despite its well-known reputation as the home of Al Capone and the Daley machine -- a lot of black people live there, too. ... More »GOT RACISM?MSNBC'S MOTTO: 'LEAN RACIST'Ann Coulter - Wed, Oct 3, 2012If one were trying to prove in court that MSNBC is crazily biased, you could do worse than submitting Rachel Maddow's Tuesday night show.She was discussing the recently released June 2007 tape of Barack Obama using Hillary Clinton's black accent to tell an audience of black preachers that the U.S. government doesn't care about black people, Maddow explained with her typical leaden sarcastic wit that the tape reveals Obama's "secret plan to be way more black than he seems to you now. ...

Journalists couldn't risk having Obama's campaign slogan "Osama is dead" being amended with "and so is our ambassador. ...

During this first round, The New York Times, The Atlantic and the TV networks each put in a splendid showing.I'd need a book to cover it all! HOLD ON! I HAVE ONE -- "Mugged: Racial Demagoguery From the Seventies to Obama," available in fine bookstores near you Sept. 25, 2012.Today, we will focus on the outstanding individual performance of the man who, since the departure of Contessa Brewer, is widely regarded by his colleagues as the stupidest on-air personality at MSNBC. ...

Within hours of his idiotic comments about "legitimate rape," Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS pulled out millions of dollars in funding for the Missouri Senate race. Akin didn't get the hint.Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, withdrew all funding from the Missouri race. Akin still refused to quit.Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a major Christian and tea party favorite, immediately called for Akin to withdraw from the race -- nothing. ... More »MISSOURI: THE 'SHOW ME ANOTHER G.O.P. CANDIDATE' STATEWHY LIBERALS BEHAVE THE WAY THEY DOAnn Coulter - Wed, Aug 15, 2012My smash best-seller "Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America" has just come out in paperback -- and not a moment too soon! Democrats always become especially mob-like during presidential election campaigns.The "root cause" of the Democrats' wild allegations against Republicans, their fear of change, their slogans and insane metaphors, are all explained by mass psychology, diagnosed more than a century ago by the French psychologist Gustave Le Bon, on whose work much of my own book is based. ...

That's why the media are so hot to get their hands on Romney's tax records for the past 25 years. They need something to "pick through, distort and lie about" -- as the Republican candidate says.Obama's usual campaign method, used in 100 percent of his races, has been to pry into the private records of his opponents. ...

Just as society can become inured to violence, it can also become inured to sentiment. There is nothing so hackneyed in the world of photojournalism as pictures of the hugging and the shrines with candles and teddy bears after a tragedy, with a piano softly trilling in the background.This accomplishes nothing. If you want to do something, please write a check to a good charity, a family financially harmed by the shooting, or send flowers to a specific person. ...

LAW FIRMAnn Coulter - Wed, Jul 11, 2012Most Americans don't care about whether Attorney General Eric Holder is hiding Fast and Furious documents because they don't understand the story.Until someone can tell us otherwise, there is only one explanation for why President Obama's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives gave thousands of guns to Mexican drug dealers: It put guns in their hands to strengthen liberals' argument for gun control.Precisely because this is such a jaw-dropping accusation -- criminality at the highest level of government to score a political point -- Republicans refuse to make it. ...

LAW FIRMON JULY 4, REMEMBER: WE ARE NOT FRENCHAnn Coulter - Wed, Jul 4, 2012(Editors: This column is adapted from "Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America.")It has become fashionable to equate the French and American revolutions, but they share absolutely nothing in common beyond the word "revolution." The American Revolution was a movement based on ideas, painstakingly argued by serious men in the process of creating what would become the freest, most prosperous nation in world history.The French Revolution was a revolt of the mob. ...

More »THE BIGGEST SCANDAL IN U.S. HISTORYVULGARIANS ON THE LOOSE!Ann Coulter - Wed, Jun 20, 2012A Michigan legislator, Lisa Brown, gave a speech in the statehouse last week that would have made her right at home in a women's studies course at a local community college, but a wacko in a group of actual legislators.She commented on a pending abortion bill by first announcing that she was Jewish, kept kosher, described her various sets of plates, and then saying that Jewish law makes abortion mandatory to save the life of the mother.This had absolutely nothing to do with the bill being considered, but it may explain why there are no Jewish Tim Tebows. ...

This was not reassuring to those of us who suspect the Democrats haven't the first idea what "private sector" means.He did not help matters by becoming lachrymose over the suffering of public sector employees: "Where we're seeing weaknesses in our economy have to do with state and local government. ...

As we go to press it's still too close to call.President Obama wanted to go to Wisconsin, but he just didn't have time. He's been doing so many campaign fundraisers lately he barely has time to play golf.The left's "outspent" argument is ridiculous. ...

(Gov. Tim Pawlenty: "Minnesota has a reputation for clean and fair and good elections. We've got 4,100 precincts run by volunteers. They do a good job, and we thank them.")The public sector unions are trying to oust Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker from office for impinging on their princely, taxpayer-supported lifestyles. ...

It's clear that Obama has been the most fiscally moderate president we've had in 60 years." There's even a chart!I'll pause here to give you a moment to mop up the coffee on your keyboard. Good?

The earnest, reform-minded liberal running for Senate against Scott Brown, R-Mass., lied about being part-Cherokee to get a job at Harvard.Harvard took full advantage of Warren's lie, bragging to The Harvard Crimson about her minority status during one of the near-constant student protests over insufficient "diversity" in the faculty. Warren also listed herself as an Indian in law school faculty directories and, just last month, said, "I am very proud of my Native American heritage. ...

For decades, a majority of Americans have wanted to decrease immigration. Not just illegal immigration -- all immigration.Nearly three times as many Americans support reducing immigration as want it to stay the same, according to Gallup polls. A grand total of 5 percent of the population want to increase legal immigration -- 10 times less than want to decrease it. I myself would like to deport the people responsible for our current immigration policies. ...

He is the rare Republican who recognizes that in-state tuition, driver's licenses and amnesty are magnets for more illegal immigration.  ...

(MSNBC'S Karen Finney blamed "the same people who stymied gun regulation at every point.") This would be like demanding more funding for the General Services Administration after seeing how its employees blew taxpayer money on a party weekend in Las Vegas. ...

Some Republicans seem to support all military deployments just out of habit.For years after the 9/11 terrorist attack on America, Democrats hysterically bemoaned any military action, especially in Iraq. ...

The Non-Fox Media's take-away is that Romney suffered a major setback Tuesday night.No matter what happens, Barack Obama's boosters in the NFM portray it as a debilitating blow to Romney.

To comprehend why the political class reacted as if Romney had just praised Hitler, you must understand that his critics live in a world in which no one can ever be fired -- a world known as "the government."(And a tip for you Washington types: Just because a person became rich without working for government doesn't mean he is "Wall Street."

It was his "answers."No fancy wordsmithery is going to get Perry out of supporting in-state tuition for illegal aliens.

Instead, those women say, Sam Walton's empire employed a crude form of Marxism.Men were often paid more than women in the same jobs, according to legal documents, and women who complained were told that the men needed more money because they were expected to support their families.

Given the barrage of missiles, it's no surprise that the total cost for Tomahawks after the first week was nearly $269 million, according to the Pentagon.When you add bombers, destroyers and assorted other war machinery, Operation Odyssey Dawn cost taxpayers nearly $600 million in the first week; a scaled-down engagement will continue to cost as much as $100 million a week, experts say.

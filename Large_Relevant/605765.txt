Hey YouTubers and house music lovers!
Most people skip these comments, and I can see why, but at the moment there’s nothing else I can do to get myself heard.
My aim is to produce fresh new tunes to satisfy as many people as I can.
I’ve just released two﻿ new tracks, ‘Do The Robot’ and ‘Hard Wired’. Give them a quick listen, let me know what you think, and if you like me, get right back here to thumbs up this comment.
Thanks a lot, I appreciate it,
T. Vandenberk

Hey guys, this IS spam, I know it sucks but keep reading, it could﻿ change my life!
I’m Ezra and I’m a young music producer, I make mainly electronic music but I try not to let my genre fall into a category. Im trying to reach 50’000 views and 3000 subs by the end of the year, but its tough going.
So come and check out 1 of my songs, you can’t be THAT busy, you’re on YouTube!
Thanks for reading and probably leaving horrible hate messages, which is fair enough spam sucks, but its free advertising!

Hey YouTubers and house music﻿ lovers!
Most people skip these comments, and I can see why, but at the moment there’s nothing else I can do to get myself heard.
My aim is to produce fresh new tunes to satisfy as many people as I can.
I’ve just released two new tracks, ‘Do The Robot’ and ‘Hard Wired’. Give them a quick listen, let me know what you think, and if you like me, get right back here to thumbs up this comment.
Thanks a lot, I appreciate it,

Hey guys i'm a 17 year old EDM promoter that is trying to give undiscovered producers
a chance to get NOTICED!!!
I know this is annoying to see, but there are some awesome producers out there that
are getting frustrated because their music never gets heard.
so on my channel i promote﻿ them and recommend them to bigger promoter and record
labels!!!
If you would, please visit my channel to support the new and undiscovered producers
and if you are a producer just inbox me

Hey YouTubers and house music lovers!
Most people skip these comments, and I can see why, but at the moment there’s nothing else I can do﻿ to get myself heard.
My aim is to produce fresh new tunes to satisfy as many people as I can.
I’ve just released two new tracks, ‘Do The Robot’ and ‘Hard Wired’. Give them a quick listen, let me know what you think, and if you like me, get right back here to thumbs up this comment.
Thanks a lot, I appreciate it,
T. Vandenberk

Hey guys, this IS spam, I know it sucks but﻿ keep reading, it could change my life!
I’m Ezra and I’m a young music producer, I make mainly electronic music but I try not to let my genre fall into a category. Im trying to reach 50’000 views and 3000 subs by the end of the year, but its tough going.
So come and check out 1 of my songs, you can’t be THAT busy, you’re on YouTube!
Thanks for reading and probably leaving horrible hate messages, which is fair enough spam sucks, but its free advertising!

Hey guys, this IS spam, I know it sucks but keep reading, it could change my life!
I’m Ezra and I’m a young music producer, I make mainly electronic music but I try not to let my genre fall into a category. Im trying to reach 50’000 views and 3000 subs by the end of the year, but its tough going.
So come and check out﻿ 1 of my songs, you can’t be that busy, you’re on YouTube!
Thanks for reading and probably leaving horrible hate messages, which is fair enough spam sucks, but its free advertising!

Hey YouTubers and house music lovers!
Most people skip these comments, and I can see why, but at the moment there’s nothing else I can do to﻿ get myself heard.
My aim is to produce fresh new tunes to satisfy as many people as I can.
I’ve just released two new tracks, ‘Do The Robot’ and ‘Hard Wired’. Give them a quick listen, let me know what you think, and if you like me, get right back here to thumbs up this comment.
Thanks a lot, I appreciate it,

Hey YouTubers and house music lovers!
Most people skip these comments, and I can see why, but at the moment there’s nothing else I can do to get myself heard.
My aim is to produce fresh new tunes to satisfy as many people as I can.
I’ve just released two new tracks, ‘Do The﻿ Robot’ and ‘Hard Wired’. Give them a quick listen, let me know what you think, and if you like me, get right back here to thumbs up this comment.
Thanks a lot, I appreciate it,
T. Vandenberk

Hey guys, this IS spam, I know it sucks but keep reading, it could change my life!
I’m Ezra and I’m a young music producer, I make mainly electronic music but I try not to let my genre fall into a category. Im trying to reach 50’000 views and 3000 subs by the end of the year, but its tough going.
So come and check out 1 of my songs, you can’t be that busy, you’re on YouTube!
Thanks for reading and probably leaving horrible hate messages, which is fair enough spam sucks, but its free﻿ advertising!

Hey guys, this IS spam, I know it sucks but keep reading, it can change my life!
I’m Ezra and I’m a music producer, I make mainly electronic music but I try not to let my genre fall into a category. I’m trying to reach 50’000 views and 3000 subs by the end of the year, but its tough going.
So come and check out 1﻿ of my songs, you can’t be that busy, you’re on YouTube!
Thanks for reading and probably leaving horrible hate messages, which is fair enough spam sucks, but it’s free advertising!

She's so pretty, smart, and fun to watch. it would mean a lot to her if you all go check out her channel and subscribe. I bet she would be so happy! thumbs up so everyone can see. I know it may sound pushy but when i was watching her video(s) she mentioned her mom pasted a way when she was﻿ 9. i think she would be happy to know YOUTUBE loves her.

Hey YouTubers and house music lovers!
Most people skip these comments, and I can see why, but at the moment there’s nothing else I can do to get myself heard.
My aim is to produce fresh new tunes to satisfy as many people as I can.
I’ve just released two new tracks, ‘Do The Robot’ and ‘Hard Wired’. Give them a quick listen, let me know what you think, and if you like me, get right back here to thumbs up this comment.
Thanks a lot, I appreciate﻿ it,
T. Vandenberk

Hey YouTubers and house music lovers!
Most people skip these comments, and I can see why, but at the moment there’s nothing else I can do to get myself heard.
My aim is to produce fresh new tunes to satisfy as many people as I can.
I’ve just released two new tracks, ‘Do The Robot’ and ‘Hard Wired’. Give them a quick listen, let me know what you think, and if you like﻿ me, get right back here to thumbs up this comment.
Thanks a lot, I appreciate it,
T. Vandenberk

Hey YouTubers and house music lovers!
Most people skip these comments, and I can see why, but at the moment there’s nothing else I can do to get myself heard.
My aim is to produce fresh new tunes to satisfy as many people as I can.
I’ve just released two new tracks, ‘Do The Robot’ and ‘Hard Wired’. Give them a quick listen, let me know what you think, and if you like me, get right back here to thumbs﻿ up this comment.
Thanks a lot, I appreciate it,
T. Vandenberk

Yeah, a non Bolshevik, member of the Social Democratic Party after the split in 1903. You claim to be on the left and yet you defend the those of high socioeconomic status. You are against class warfare. You believe that the rich the are willing to aid those less privileged. You say it as though you believe﻿ change can only come from above. You're a reactionist.

...the support of those who have power already. Only then can those who are on the bottom succeed. I'm neither defending nor insulting the rich. There are rich people like the Buffetts, who aid society, and there are those like the Romneys, who fit your image of the evil rich person.
Making enemies is pointless and childish. Saying your a Bolshevik is retarded. Claiming that you're spearheading any sort of revolution is idiotic. Declaring that true, Marxist Communism﻿ is the only way is wrong.

Hi guys, Im Mogey and probably the billionth comment you’ve read like this! Unfortunately, the people who do this get the most views, so inevitably, here I am.
I'm far from a﻿ beginner, Ive had a release on a label and Im releasing an official remix for Locnville! Everyone famous once started out small,﻿ and Im small-ish now!
Im sure you have at least one minute to spare to give me listen, but even if not, it takes less than a second to give a thumbs up, and it would mean the world to me!
Thanks

PLEASE don't' be sorry, I didn't intent to make you sorry.. I'm not a fan of this song but I like the new EP from Skrillex, the songs 'Reason' and 'Leaving' sounds a lot like 'Summit' but somehow I like them a lot more than summit. Besides that I think Pikachu is﻿ amazing :D

Hey guys, Sorry but this IS spam, I know it sucks..
I’m Ezra, a man﻿ on a mission, I make my own genre of music. I’m trying to reach 50’000 views and 3000 subs by the end of the year, but it’s tough when my way to get views is asking random people for help.
So I’m asking you to check out 1 of my songs, I’m not asking much I mean you can’t be that busy, you’re on YouTube
Thanks for reading and probably leaving horrible hate messages, which is fair enough spam sucks and I’m sorry for that.

For future reference, using smiley faces to get under people's skin isn't always effective. :)
The point I'm making is that one class hating another gets us nowhere.﻿ I despise the concept of trickedown economics and find it utterly nonsensical. I do, however, support the idea of using one's own influence to change their leadership to better suit them. Instead of doing that, however, people just bitch about "The System" and now evil it is.

Hagel contradicts himself here and McCain missed it. He refused to assess his judgement call on the surge, and tries to cover it up by saying that his criticism of the surge was really about the overall war of choice.﻿ Yet, he voted for this war of choice! I don't know how anyone could see this testimonial contradiction as anything less than disingenuous. His integrity is clearly in question.

Maybe u didn't watch the hearing, but it was quite obvious there was an agenda to make Hagel go on record that he pledges support to Israel. Which is odd cuz sec of defense has no jurisdiction over foreign policy. Why do us politicians have to support a﻿ Zionist regime anyways ?

Don't worry about Chuck. He's handled McCain's tantrum with ease. The ultra right wing can ask﻿ their questions .... it's their right but Hagel has been through the grinder before. He knows what comes next. This is nothing.

John McCain, did you or did you not pick Sara Palin as your running mate during your failed attempt at sanity during the presidential election. Please give me a yes or no answer. Only a yes or no answer. No grunting glaring or﻿ hate filled rhetoric for anything to do with President Obama. No disassembling or shoving it off on your inept staff. Just you. Yes or no.

Seeing McCain today was embarrassing.
He went after a friend (Hagel) with pure maliciousness.
Bear in mind that McCain became buddies with Dubya, the guy whose campaign started rumors about McCain fathering a baby with a black woman.
So McCain becomes loyal to a guy who played him dirty back in 2000, and betrays a guy who was loyal to him today.
Bottom of the barrel, Johnny, bottom of the﻿ barrel.

At Hagel hearing, 136 mentions of Israel and 135 of Iran. Only 27 refs to Afghanistan. 2 for Al Qaida. 1 for Mali.

Say that in Washington, DC and now you're anti-semtic! People need to realize that many Jews in Israel don't even agree with﻿ the actions of their own government. Hagel should have come out swinging against Swiftboat McCain and asked him why he wanted the US to stay in Iraq for 100 years. Like that stupid surge really won anything. We left the place a mess and its still a mess.

If it was left up to McCain and people like him, America would be﻿ at war against the entire world for the next 1000 years... they will not stop until it gets to the point where no one is even ALLOWED to say anything bad about Israel. It's rather sickening. What a total waste of money, resources and good men and women.

Zionist? Hardly... you just can't stand the fact that a tiny little country of jews completely surrounded by incompetent and corrupt Muslim nations won't play by your pathetic set of rules. ﻿ The jews went quietly into the night in 1939 and were almost exterminated; they won't make the same mistake twice. As far as being a neo-con, I don't even pretend to understand what that implies. If that means that I believe in personal liberty, to smoke pot, and keep the gov't out of my bedroom, then yes

Why do they need our money, then? Surely Israel can protect itself at this point, can it not? I mean we give them $4352897238952789 every single year along with an endless amount of airplanes, weapons and moral support... what else do they want? Any country which cannot survive by itself does not deserve to exist... they've had since 1948 to stand on﻿ their own, and yet they still refuse to do so. You believe in personal liberty? Do you agree then we should cut funding to Israel?

I believe we should﻿ cut off all foreign money, ALL OF IT, unless we are actually "getting something" in return, i.e. economic rights, trade deals, use of straits or waterways, energy, etc. We just gave the Muslim brotherhood dozens of the most modern F16s and M1 tanks, as well as most of the other countries in the middle east, Morocco, Saudi, Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan, and Turkey all get US Aid and arms. Israel is not exclusive. Cut it off, cut it all off.

I'll never understand the anti-Hagel crowd. He's one﻿ of the only good Republicans out there. Why should I, as a tax paying citizen, support occupations of foreign countries while my own country is in an economic mess? Neo-con logic is truly self-destructive.

The GOP hate him because Defense is their cash-cow. The GOP don't want anything to happen to pork-barrel Defense spending. That's what their whole fiscal﻿ responsibility push is about, keeping their interests funded now that we're broke. And they're even willing to rob Soc. Sec.& Medicare to do it.

Look, Obama's stinking ass has approved so much drilling Liberals are already bashing him﻿ for it. Those oil cronies are even trying to drill in deep-water Alaska right now. Most of the smaller drillers pulled out to see if it could be done by Shell. And they won't do it. You're talking storms out the ass with 40 foot swells. Sub-zero temperatures. You can't clean up a spill. They shouldn't even be up there.

Most conservatives would disagree. If you cut defense spending, it results in job loss within the defense industry while making our﻿﻿ nation weaker. However, a majority of conservatives would agree with reasonable defense spending cuts if they correspond to equivalent cuts in entitlement spending. We spend much more on defense today than we did during the height of the Iraq war. So there should be room for compromise if viewed from that perspective.

I am saying this not as a democrat orrepublican but a constitutionalists libertarian and as a pro-life christian. What threat did the sovereign nation of Iraq present to﻿ Americans rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We elected Bush and he pushed us into a war and united right-wingers; he left office with a corporate bail out for one company, that our current dictator turned into a multi-billion dollar corporate bail out package for wealthy executives who made bad investments.

then our current dictator fails to have a budget and a tax code for four years which means﻿ that a lot of companies that would like to expand and create more jobs are holding their breath to see how they have to plan their business. Not to mention a health care bill that was pushed through while everyone else was busy celebrating christmas 2010, no one really knows what is in this bill but it sounds a lot like hitlers t-4 program.

I disagree a lot with Obama on the economy and his spending but the one thing that I agree with him is on his appointment of Hagel. After reading about Hagel's background no one is more qualified. They pick one person who has reservations﻿ about war and thinks about the costs of war and they give him this bullshit.

Same here! I'm not an Obama supporter at all, but it's absolutely hilarious how the neo-cons are attacking Hagel, a REPUBLICAN just because he dared to stand up against the wars and﻿ speaks out against funding countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia. I can guarantee if Obama had picked a Democrat who was pro-interventionist, this would never go down.

Really McCain is a mentally sick man the way he acts. Most ppl go into war and learn the lesson that it is hell but with McCain he wanted to keep Iraq going for "100 years"﻿ if necessary. Thats an actual quote. Most vets get into politics to continue to serve the nation but McCain and Lieberman have rumored ties to organized crime and setting up Foxwoods in Connecticut with the mafia. McCain has made millions off his war hero story he is not to be trusted.

Writing in caps doesn't prove anything except that you're having difficulty seeing things clearly! This douche is the best Obama thinks our Military deserves. He was fucking owned by Dems and Republicans because he's so out of touch with﻿ our current situation in the middle east. Spew all the crap you want, but get yourself some damn glasses and see this trainwreck decision for what it really is!

It is possible Obama is wising up since after this he is out﻿ of politics he seems to be distancing himself from the mega banks and old guard cabinet positions are being switched. Its possible Obama may shift US foreign policy away from interventionist before the end of his term its obvious he was never for it but the money masters had him tied down with SuperPAC contributions to keep the war machine roaring. Now he is bringing in actual former military vets this is quite interesting

War-mongering scum they are. But if they voted﻿ against those 2 Bush tax cuts, they must of had a lick of sense at the time. Those friggin tax cuts went mainly to the top, and they were paid for by robbing Social Security & Medicare. And what did we get for it? I'll tell ya, all of our jobs sent to China. Then the Bush gang gave all of their corporate friends another tax free-ride and let them bring tonnes of cash back to the U.S. on the cheap to create jobs & they pocketed the money.

And in case yur dumb-ass didn't know it, GE threw Obama's ass under the bus & cut off his campaign cash. So did Goldman & the other banker fucks. You can look it up by Googling - > Goldman Sachs Leads Split With Obama, as GE Jilts Him Too.. I guess Obama didn't have his nose up their ass as far as﻿ you thought. Now, piss off

And another thing fuck-stain, you got balls giving the GOP a pass on corporate cash. Those GOP﻿ fuck-stains won't even tell the American people where their cash comes from. And it was the GOP who bashed Obama for 3 years to pass those crooked trade deals with Panama, Columbia & South Korea. And when Obama finally agreed to pass them (after reworking them) the GOP refused to allow Obama cash for U.S. job training, which was part of the deal .So Obama told the GOP to piss off & held them up again

And it was Obama who got those robber-baron drug companies to take an 80 billion hit on th costs of seniors drugs. It would've been more, but everything in Washington﻿ is a crooked deal. And Obamacare is the same as we already have. Those exchanges will be full of private HC providers. Look at the GOP's health care plan, we already pay double the world for HC and they wanna rob Medicare and make us pay more. Maybe you should look at who's fucking you the most, instead bashing Obama all the time

Hagel keeps bringing up the﻿ judgement of history because he knows McCain is on the losing side thats all. The whole world looks at the Iraq war and sees what really happened. 1 million casualties against a country with no army. We had a lush president for 8 years and an idiot running named John McCain thats what history records.

Both your parties are fucked up. The GOP and the Dems have the same foreign policy and big government Fascist attitudes. Obama's foreign policy is George Bush's on steroids. NDAA anyone? Oh, and can't leave the Repubs hangin, the whole Iraq bullshit invasion was for control over oil and geo-political control over that land. Both parties are fucked up and till you realize that, YOU, are the one who needs﻿ s a fucking wakeup call.

Well McCain is a neocon that thinks if it wasn't for all those tree hugging liberals (99% of the country right﻿ before the end of Vietnam), we would have won the war there. There was nothing to be won by the time we had scorch earthed Vietnam. Meanwhile McCain was supposedly tortured there, but he still thinks it was a great idea to get in somebody elses war for 20 years. The same neocon types brought down JFK and started Vietnam he was removing the advisers.

You useful idiot was Bill "Bombs Over Bagdad" Clinton﻿ a "Neo-Con" for bombing Iraq in 1999 due to Saddam Hussein's refusal to allow UN Weapon Inspectors in ... Or is someone just a "NEO-CON" when they defend AMERICA'S BEST INTERESTS as opposed to DEMOCRATS who serve our enemies best interest?

I would say Clinton was a center-right president he was most certainly not a liberal. We have not had anything close to a liberal since Carter and before that John Kennedy... I'm not sure Obama is even a true liberal. He endorses many hawkish policies but following the coup in 1963 in Dallas I don't know many of them are neocons including Clinton who regularly fishes and plays golf with Elder Bush. They are all in﻿ on it together. Hagel seems like a distinguished veteran McCain should respect it

JFK had a great monetary policy and its possibly why they took him out of the equation. As for Ron Paul I would agree with you. Now we are talking about classical liberalism and conservatism vs. modern ideologies. Even TDR was﻿ for preserving our national lands and environment before it was popular and he was a Republican. Far too often we are stuck inside the box. They won't let Hagel in because he has war experience the money masters don't want a cabinet full of veterans it ruins their plans.

The bottom line is that Hagel would be an anti-war Secretary of Defense. That means he would obey the Commander-in-Chief and Congress, but he would not be SECRETARY OF OFFENSE like the last 30 years. Not one has served except this guy and theyre﻿ going right after him cause he knows the true horror of war and won't accept big money in his pocket to go into yet another stupid war. This guy looks like he would be good for the job maybe teach even Obama about foreign policy.

CAIR doesn't control our foreign policy or our Congress. Last time I checked Iran wasn't getting billions of dollars a year from us and unchecked support. You're rather retarded, aren't you? I'm not a democrat nor a socialist, however you, with your internationalist views, are much more a "socialist' than I will ever be. After all, Israel was founded on national﻿ socialism, the country which you love more than your own. Once again, I ask you: why not move to Israel if you love it so much?

And Obama's even letting those gas-fracking-fucking-idiots dump millions of gallons of radioactive toxic chemical waste into the very rivers and streams across the country that provide our drinking water. They﻿ also dump it in the Gulf, too. You can thank Dick Cheney & his back-room energy policy that scrapped the safe water act for gas-fracking-idiots. Drink up!

McCain is part of the big problem in Washington. He cannot admit the war in Vietnam or the war in Iraq were disasters because he﻿ supported both. He does not have the brains or the courage to admit he and the government were wrong. Good for Hagel to tell the truth. Thanks to Hagel also for not being a Zionist ass kisser like the rest of the pathetic Liberals and Conservatives congressfreaks in DC.

Why he doesn't let him reply. OMG﻿ this Mc cain is getting on my nerves. If I were Chuck Hagel, God knows what I could have done to him to shut his mug.

He's asking for a simple response. Was Hagel's assessment of the surge correct or incorrect? That's a very focused and precise question and merits a focused and precise answer not a bloated, bullshit politician's answer. McCain pressed and﻿ Hagel couldn't squirm out of it.

Hagel had to put things in their context. Mc Caim was ordering him to say what his ears want to hear, that's it. This is in no way a manner to ask someone. The closed﻿ questions where you can only answer by "yes" or" no" are not adapted to this kind of situation.

You gain no points with ad hominem attacks. John McCain is one of the most honorable senators in Washington. He spent years undergoing torture in a POW camp and refused an offer by the North Vietnamese for early release until other American POWs who were captured before him were released. So﻿ stop being a keyboard, virtual warrior and STFU.

Only reason I'm bothering responding is to do you the favour of drawing it to your attention that you have become a 'sheep' of the GoP.﻿ No need to respond. Just doing you a favour. Please reflect.

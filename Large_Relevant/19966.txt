Can't wait until Apple sues the government for using self healing synthetic materials infringing on their patent for a technology that may or may not come apart and may or may not come back together﻿ at some point.

Cloaking will always be better because you can rob banks and stuff. The skin would be great if it was instant and could help protect against bullets >.> but the police could still track you﻿ because you AREN'T INVISIBLE!

The self-healing synthetic skin since the cloaking tech has actually been around for some time now. I remember back in 2010 I watched a video on cloaking tech that﻿ operated where if you were caught on video and had this cloak on it would not see you (The camera).

The self healing, conductive "skin" is freaking amazing! I think that is one of the most useful discoveries in the past 20 years, and will revolutionize the way we design. As an engineer, I'm excited to find applications for﻿ the stuff!

Will they find a way to make it possible for the self-healing skin to be used for burn victims? Skin graphing on burn victims is a long and painful process and a synthetic skin could be used to drastically reduce﻿ risk of infection and healing time, that would be a truly great advance, especially if they could find a way to fuse it back to the actual undamaged skin of the body. Maybe using stem cells...?

Please, being one myself, the correct term for someone who has been burned and survived and is in the process of recovery should be called "Burn Survivor"﻿ . We who have been burned, once we leave the hospital from the initial injury We are no longer victims. I know you are probably not one of us, so it is an easy mistake to make, but we are Survivors on many levels. Just so you know for future reference. We who are Burn Survivors thank you for your thoughts . Be Well . TSS ;-) .

Cloaks, then my Halloween ninja costume would be complete. I could walk up behind my friends and appear silently and stab one with in the neck! Wait, no no no. I could sneak into the﻿ counselors office and change my physics mark from 16.5% to 83.2%.
Speaking of physics and Joe's love for science, drop an object, time how long it takes to hit the ground, square the time and multiply by 5 and that's almost spot on how tall the object is in meters. Fuck yeah, something useful in school!

Both are so experimental... The cloak is 1﻿ sided and the self-healing skin could merge with everything around it, not with what is intented to merge to. Still, self-healing is a winner here.

the cloaking is cool, although seemingly impossible to actually achieve from any﻿ angle. theres no way to reflect whats behind an object from every angle...

Skin is a better idea than the cloak. Invisibility makes people ass holes. Really though think about it, name one good thing you can do with invisibility. You can spy on people, rob people, or scare people, that is it, and the worst﻿ part is invisibility motivates you to try it.

Personally , I was one of many American kids who, back in the late70's--early 80's Pres. Jimmy Carter started having teachers teach us both the Metric﻿ & Imperial systems of weight & measures. I'm thankful that he did this because both systems have stuck with my for my life. I still remember that 2.54 cm=1" inch and that 3.78L=1 gallon. So, when I think gas prices are bad, I remember that those buying by the Liter are paying almost 4 times that. So we get off lucky. Wish they still taught metric

Being a Disabled Veteran& Full Body Burn Survivor , I have to say Self Healing Synthetic skin is a huge deal for us who have had the horrible incident called "Being Burned Alive" happen to us. Having skin like that grafted on to me could make possible that my﻿ new skin could actually help my body regenerate over the damaged areas& make it so I have to have less surgeries. And less surgeries (30 in 14 years) is always a good thing. Cloaking is cool (just ask a Romulan), but Synth Skin wins here.

30 Skin Graft&Reconstructive surgeries since; Member- The Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors.; Thankful for everyday I'm still above ground. This new skin may help future surgeries go better because the current synth skin is very fragile & does not heal well at all. I pray this kind of break through will help all of us Burn survivors. :-)

No, I do not. Being U.S. Air Force I was not on the "Front Lines" as it﻿ was. My injury was Non-Service connected , so the V.A. has nothing to do with my care. I was awarded The Outstanding Unit Award & The Good Conduct Medal. I now seek care at The National Burn Reconstruction Center at Good Samaritan Hospital in Baltimore, MD. My Surgeon, Dr.Robert Spence is an awesome Plastic Surgeon who specializes in Burn Reconstruction. He has saved my life & my skin on numerous occasions. I love his work

Skin...self healing skin is waaaaay more awesome than cloaking devices.

If you're into murdering people on the other side of the earth, the cloaking is better, if you like the idea of one day gaining immortality, the skin is better. :-D

Cloacking sounds super cool, and self-heal artifical skin is also cool... Although I believe cloacking is cooler, I've to go with the selfhealskin to be better becasue other﻿ than military cloacking has not much of a real world application that I can think of at the moment.

No no no! On cloaking, in 2006 scientists developed a cloaking device. The Americans developed a light bending technology made of various high tech metals forming what they call metamaterial. Japan madea similar discovery but it didn't cloak as well. Who knows what improvements have been obedience Japan since. This info. was released in 2008 on the discovery although here had been people that had realized the testing of it﻿ adore hand. look up metamaterial

Self healing skin will eventually marry some sort of bio bullet/weapon resistive element, maybe spider webbing, and become the ultimate bullet proof vest which will eventually become the ultimate soldier skin and it will be worn by the brave stormtroopers of our great American empire someday in the near future and that's my﻿ thoughts all wrapped up into one giant run-on sentence!

Cloaking technology isn't all that new and as said in this video there haven't been any break throughs in it's development and the whole experiment in this video isn't the best attempt at invisibility. Also﻿ self regenerating skin tissue (or rather something resembling it) also isn't all that new and the discovery mentioned in this video, while interesting isn't that big a of deal. So meh... Still doesn't change the fact that SCIENCE IS COOL!

Honestly, I think as far as cloaking, projecting the image from the rear of an object in front of that said object, while modifying it so that it seems as﻿ though it IS further away than it really is (as it is in front not behind) is the Cloaking technology that we will really see developed for military applications etc. With advances in nano technology this sort of cloaking will not only be possible, but quite honestly, simple.

They have been working on that﻿ cloaking technology for many years... It's not getting very far. The synthetics are booming and getting really good real fast. I'd say the skin, therefore.

As for actual application: skin, it has a lot more benefits for common tech and (huge) benefits in the medical field. Now don't get me wrong, cloaking is bad ass, but how many times will you ever need to save a life using cloaking? The cloaking﻿ would only be used/developed for militaristic use and cause more gruesome combat and warfare.

Self healing skin, lol. What happens if you get into an﻿ accident with another person, both you and that person gets knocked out for half and hour and your wound just so happens to be touching the other person's wound? You'll heal and become a part of the other person. Conjoined twins. :D

the cloak is more impressive but is a while away from becoming completely useful. the skin on the other hand is probably easier to implement more quickly so i have to go with the skin. plus i actually understand how it﻿ works thanks to my physics and chemistry classes

I think the self﻿ healing skin is more awesome, because it has a lot of real world, and consumer applications. As for the cloak its really awesome but doesn't really provide any good consumer applications. And its also incomplete. But still awesome.

They are standing﻿ in the same room but they aren't actually that close together, so they get edited to look side-by-side. Sometimes the editing team makes a mistake.

Hmm, that actually happens a lot. They separate screens, for some reasons.
So﻿ one can actually deliver the line while the other would not have to pay 100% attention, it takes the risk factor of someone messing up of scene down, they can just edit it out.

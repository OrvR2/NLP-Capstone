the profits that've come from this factory far exceed any insurance payments, because it's .63 cents for every 50 bangladeshi taka. to the corporate-world citizens of the﻿ 3rd world frankly are worthless. the families of the deceased would get dizzy if even handed a mere 1,000US. pathetic sign of the times.

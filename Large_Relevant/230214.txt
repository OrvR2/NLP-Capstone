Are Children Just Supposed To Shut Up And Die?
by Tommy Christopher | 3:23 pm, January 18th, 2013

» 106 comments




 
















  

During the same week in which the National Rifle Association launched an attack ad directed at the protection of President Obama‘s daughters, and a false one, at that, courageous voices have emerged to denounce the “stomach-churning” use of children for political purposes. Unfortunately, these conservative voices aren’t referring to the NRA’s outrageous attack, but to the children who wrote to President Obama asking him to do something about gun violence. If the NRA deserves a voice, then surely, the children whose lives are at stake deserve one, too.
To be clear, I don’t think it’s always appropriate to involve children in politics, nor do I think it’s always inappropriate to reference a politician’s kids in a political ad; as with most things, it depends on how you do it. Those videos in which parents shove their children at a Michele Bachmann type, and gruffly coach them on how to shame her, are the wrong way, as is releasing a false ad that calls the security of the First Daughters into question. Both instances say more about the adult messengers than they do about the children involved.
It’s also not entirely dependent on the kids’ desire to speak, or the parents’ consent for them to do so. News outlets should have shown restraint, and not rushed to interview kids when their parents’ judgment was compromised in the hours after the shooting.
Children also aren’t necessarily relevant to every political issue, at least not directly. Liberals and conservatives, at various times, have invoked the “children and grandchildren” who will have to pay for whatever it is they don’t want to pay for, but you’re not likely to hear those actual children weigh in on fiscal policy.
However, children are uniquely relevant to the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, yet it seems as though we’re ready to give a voice to anyone and everyone except the group of people who were the targets of that attack. The kids who sat onstage as President Obama unveiled his plans were not coerced, or compromised by fresh trauma, they wrote thoughtful letters to the President, they were invited to attend, and that’s what they did. Instead of wanting to silence these kids, we should be wanting to hear more from them. Those fainting and fanning themselves over this are so busy being outraged that these kids spoke out that they don’t seem to have listened to what they had to say.
Some of it was insightful, and contrary to what you might think, not all that politically helpful to the President. Third-grader Hinna asked the President, “Can we stop using guns?”
Julia, the 11 year-old whom the President addressed on stage, suggested that guns “only be used in the most horrible event, where others will get hurt if they are not.”
The measures that the President proposed don’t go anywhere near what these kids are asking for, and arguably demonstrate just how far his proposals are from where they could have gone.
Eight year-old Grant said “It’s a free country but I recommend there needs (to) be a limit with guns. Please don’t let people own machine guns or other powerful guns like that.”
Grant’s letter reads like a perfect pitch for the assault weapons ban, because he references machine guns, which have already been regulated to the point where they are no longer a significant problem, and suggests treating other weapons the same way. If the President ends up passing some watered-down version of the assault weapons ban, he’s going to have to look Grant in the eye.
That’s really what all of this is about, though. It’s not concern over propriety, or for the well-being of those kids, it’s about making policy arguments without having to look these kids in the eye. To some extent, we adults all deserve the country we get, we voted for these people, we stood by silently for years, or just didn’t care enough about it.
But when we make a mistake about gun policy, it is children who are punished for it, in many different ways. Whether or not we want to do what they tell us to do, we owe it to at least listen to what they think of how we’ve handled it.
I don’t want to hear less from these kids, I want to hear more. Were there any kids who wrote in to the President asking for their teachers to have guns? Were there kids who wrote in asking that they be allowed to carry guns? One thing that’s clear is that these shootings have frightened kids as much, if not more than, they’ve frightened us, but unlike the adults, these kids can’t do anything about it. Except write letters to the President.
The main argument against this is that it’s an appeal to “emotionality,” unlike, say, every other thing about politics, ever. In this case, though, the thoughts and feelings of these kids should be an appeal to conscience. Whether we enact all of the President’s proposals, or none of them, these kids are going to have to live in the world we create for them, and all of us, President Obama included, will have to look them in the eye and tell them we did the right thing, and we did our best. Looking away from them? Now, that’s stomach-churning.

The issue is that the children are most likely just regurgitating what adults are telling them to say. They are not old or mature enough to truly analyze the problem.
How about some right-wingers bringing kids out to say, “Please let us keep these guns so we can blow away bad guys. Please don’t let us die because we don’t have a semi-automatic weapons to ensure we get 30 bullets into an intruder and therefore far more likely prevent him from hurting us.”
Obviously… there’s two sides to all issues… a good debate… but not one for kids to have unless it’s truly coming from them… and at their age, they are not going to have meaningful input for leaders beyond what their parents or teachers have told them to say.
So to use them… from either side… is downright manipulative and disingenuous.






Anonymous



The problem is that children don’t need to “analyze” the deaths of other children.  They’re aware that they’ve been shot and killed.  The right doesn’t want them to speak out on guns becasue it exposes their side for the zelots that they are.  While a majority of NRA members agree with some of the proposed legislation and a ban on assault weapons, and by that I mean any gun that shoots more than 7 bullets at a time, these same people aren’t as loud as the gun nuts are.  Their quiet objections aren’t serving them well.  Just remember that people with guns in their homes are the most likely to be killed with those same guns even when they’re legally obtained.  Nancy Lanza is a perfect example of this.  It makes that recent story of Paul Ryan buying his daughter a rifle down right creepy.  As for the paranoid lunatics who fear the government coming for your guns, dont’ worry about that.  If they wanted to do that they could just use the GPS on a drone and blow your house right out from under you!  Your gun won’t prevent that.  You’ll need a more effective argument than this false choice!






freedomrocks4



Another false premise, nobody said silence the children, they said dont use them as political props……. “as with most things, it depends on if you are liberal or not”  fixed it






Anonymous



By the way, there aren’t always 2 sides to every story.  One plus one will always be 2.  Stick your hand in the fire and it will always burn and firing a gun with more than 7 bullets will always kill more than 7 people and that includes children. Those children who wrote those letters are a symbol of those who were killed.  You know those tv commercials that feature abused animals, shivering with broken limbs or so skinny, their bones are showing?  Do you know why they use actual animals and not just some actor talking about abused animals?  Because the animals are the actual victims of the abuse and it’s effective.






freedomrocks4



So you would approve of a pro-life ad that had children thanking their moms for not killing them?

Somebody want to gently explain to Tommy that kids can’t have opinions on guns because…..they are freaking kids! Kids can’t form intelligent opinions on complicated and complex issues. Pretending they can and that their opinions matter is absurd. All these kids are doing is repeating what the adults in their lives have told them.

so its ok for NRA to use the children death to sell the military style gun? The children were killed so the other fellow children didn’t want this to happen again. CHILDREN DIED in SANDY HOOK, other children have the right to speak up and president allowed it.

Some one made a comment and I’m responding to that comment. What are you dyslexic?

“One thing that’s clear is that these shootings have frightened kids as much, if not more than, they’ve frightened us,”
Only those kids who’s parents have failed to explain to them that they have a better chance of being harmed in a car accident or a bike accident or any number of ways other than by a madman at school.  The left is using this tragedy to push their agenda.  The left is pretending that they suddenly care about kids after continually applauding the murder of them through abortion.
None of these laws/bans/proposals would have changed a single thing that happened at Sandy Hook.  But, our corrupt media won’t tell you that.  They’re more interested in jumping on the left-wing bandwagon.  
Stop pretending like you care about children, Tommy.  You don’t.  To you, like to the President, they are merely props to use to advance your agenda.  If you cared about them, you’d have a single adult conversation without the Alan Grayson hysterics.

really? where is the NRA ad of children selling guns?

rox – if you donate even 1 cent to the “abused animals” site that advertises with those gut wrenching photos of abused and neglected animals, you are throwing your money away.  Before you laud them, check out how much good they actually do – that would be NIL!  
You want to donate to helping abused animals.  Check out your local humane society or other groups who take in animals in a no kill shelter and donate as much as you can.
Yes, there are always 2 sides to every story – somewhere, in between lies the truth usually.  Parading children by Obama was tasteless.  The killings at Newtown were carried out by an insane person.  There is a horrific problem with gun deaths in this Country.  Solutions need to be found.  Before you find solutions, you have to acknowledge the problem.  Focusing on Newtown is not identifying the problem.  That was a horrible, awful crime but does not identify what is happening in Chicago and other high crime areas.  Basically the left is saying “It’s all about Newtown” (which is false), the right is saying “Don’t touch our legal guns” (and tightening the registration of legally obtaining a gun should be part of the solution) and nobody is saying – “Hey, we want children in poor neighborhoods to be able to safely play in their parks, in front of their houses and address the true problem.

Kids and liberals are similar.  Everything revolves around emotion.  Kids aren’t versed in facts and liberals don’t care about them.

Somebody gently explain to gbearc that children were  murdered with the gun and their young friends have the right to speak up because they don’t want this to happen again.

That is always the last leg anyone has from the right when they can’t come up with a real arugement against president Obama or the Dems’. Abortion has nothing to do with gun control because that is a personal medical decision made by a woman. For the one millionth time it is none of our business what any woman decides to do with her body. I know the right wing thinks they have the right to control every womans life and what she does with her body, but once again I am here to tell you “No You Don’t.” Leave us alone when it comes our bodies. I think the president did a good thing by letting those children know he received their letters and what they had to say did make a difference to him. You are wrong.

More children die each year independently than in mass murders. Why anyone questions protecting children is beyond me. They cannot speak for themselves and yet gun nuts get freaked out when responsible parents point out the reality that kids have no voice in this discussion? Something is radically wrong with people’s thinking when this becomes an issue. Pretty sad. Grow up.

No, it’s just that I really don’t care, because….they’re kids. Presumably they’re nice, normal little kids who want everybody to stop fighting. That’s fine, but that doesn’t mean I want to hear their thoughts on nuclear proliferation, and there really isn’t place for it in the conversation about what to do with gun laws moving forward.

That’s a topic for another time.  Address the issue.
In fact, I have proposed that the Newtown crime scene photos be released, all of them, and be used in any and every way possible in the debate.
I am guessing you do not have an objection to that.

Thoughtful article, TC.  Aside from pointing out right-wing hypocrisy, you explore when it is appropriate or not to being kids into the debate, and whether they should have a say.
Guess what the next NRA ad will be, TC.
Showing someone under 18—in fact, someone who is even pre-adolescent—dressed with a Glock, a deer rifle, and maybe a modified-to-legal Uzi standing next to some adult with a mullet—dad—and saying, I am the NRA!.  Might even be a young girl rather than a snot-nosed boy.
Ask yourself, TC, if parents teaching their kids that they should truly and really learn how to break down and re-assemble weapons of all kinds in 45 seconds flat; if they should spend more time learning about the situations of what guns and ammo to use; commit to rote memory the characteristics of muzzle velocity of a gun, and the energy (in kilojoules or pounds-feet) dissipated into the target by a bullet, as opposed to learning the integral of a trigonometric function; can you ask yourself if this kind of psychological damage does not really constitute child abuse or neglect?  Should we not question this parent’s ability to be a parent?
Yes, the kids will and should be in the debate.

In 2011 728 people were murdered by being beaten or kicked to death.  No weapon was used – just hands, fists, feet, etc.  In 2011 496 people were killed by blunt objects – that would include hammers.  In 2011 1694 people were killed by knife. In 2011 323 people were killed by rifles – you know the very same rifles that MUST be banned because they are weapons of such mass destruction.  Since it’s so vitally important to get those bad, evil rifles off the street because people are just running around shooting everyone with them, we better ban knives, blunt objects, and body parts because they killed more people than those scary, dangerous rifles, right?  Cause if just one life is saved it’s worth it.

And I think they still have to be confronted.”http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/18/mark-shields/pbs-commentator-mark-shields-says-more-killed-guns/
Facts are stubborn things.

Your argument is flawed and absurd.  Gun owners and those who support
 the 2nd Amendment are not zealots. They are just like you – parents,
teachers, bankers, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, your neighbors,
your co-workers, church members, shop keepers, judges.  They are
everyone. Here’s a little surprise for you, they are democrats,
liberals, and independents too.  People who own guns, believe in the 2nd
 Amendment, and the Constitution are not limited to just one political
party.  They are Americans!
When gun control advocates – the ones who want to restrict or strip away the public’s right to own guns – feel threatened or are threatened, the first thing many of them do is hire someone WITH A GUN to protect them.
Guns are inanimate objects, they are not bad or evil.  They are tools, tools that are used by police, soldiers, government agents, body guards, private security professionals to protect and save people.  Guns are used for sport/target shooting, hunting, and individual self-defense.  People also collect guns, old guns, antique guns.  Collectors appreciate the beauty, simplicity, craftsmanship, elegance of different firearms.
People who believe a gun is designed to kill, that it’s only purpose is to injure
or kill someone, are very mistaken.  The only purpose, it’s only design
is to expel a loaded projectile out the barrel.  The person holding the
gun decides where to aim and what he hopes to hit.  A knife is designed
to cut, the person holding the knife decides what is going to be cut.
Just as some people use a knife to hurt or kill, some people use a gun
to shoot others.  In neither instance is the tool at fault or responsible – the person wielding the weapon is to blame. 
Gun owners are responsible, reasonable people, they want to keep guns out of
 the hands of criminals and those who aren’t competent just as much as
everyone else does.  Treating lawful citizens, who have committed no
crimes, like criminals and punishing them for the actions of others is
not how the government of a free country behaves towards its citizens.
Let’s all say a thankful prayer we aren’t at that point and that our 2nd Amendment right is still intact.

Sheez Tommy guess you never looked into the research done regarding children under 12 years old when they comment on subjects that are beyond their understanding.
90% of childlren under 12 were found to just mimic their parents viewpoint on subjects that were beyond their age.






lbmiel



Great comment!  Facts, statistics, civil, no hyperbole.  I love the last sentence – facts ARE stubborn things.  I like facts, though.  I like reason and logic also.  Arguments based on extreme emotion are subjective and rarely produce good solutions.  Actions based on extreme emotion often go very wrong.  The total gunfire deaths did include suicides and accidental deaths.  Did that number include deaths by police, justifiable homicide, or self-defense?  Gun violence is a problem, but some people need to stop wearing blinders about what needs to be done.  The anti-gun people have tunnel vision regarding what ideas to try to reduce shootings.  Many people actually believe the police, military, and government are the only ones who should have guns.  All the while more and more people are being injured and killed.

Why bring up the topic of showing images of aborted remains???  There was nothing in this article that would have inspired such a thought, unless that thought was not already in you?
Since the anti-choice clinic criminals have no problem showing images of aborted remains—as well as flinging them on clinic walls and doors and walkways—I see no reason that we should not fight fire with fire against gun-fondling savage filth.

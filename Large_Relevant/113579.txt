NEWS ABOUT IRAQ IS LOST IN THE FOG OF CHATTER AND GOSSIPBy Georgie Anne Geyer | Georgie Anne Geyer – Thu, Nov 3, 2011

WASHINGTON -- It might have been just a good dream, but I'm sure I heard that the president got (what is for him) "mad" and told the charitably described Iraqi "government" something about having all American troops leave Iraq by the end of the year! The story also seemed to involve "status of forces" agreements, which means that American troops can never be submitted to judgment under foreign judges or claimants.

But I'm not certain, because just as I thought I heard this dramatic bit of news on TV, it was past, and Herman Cain and his problems came on. And on. The next day's papers were barren of news on Iraq, but filled with Cain and his alleged sexual harassment. (Abel was nowhere to be seen, either.)

Now, any normal country, having dived so precipitously into a strange place such as Iraq, without any knowledge or appreciation of the land or its odd and cruel habits, would  surely lead off the next day's news -- and days thereafter, if only in honor of the 4,500 or so Americans and 100,000 Iraqis who have died there -- with a follow-up to the troops-coming-home story. But, no, we had more important things to focus on -- we had Herman Cain.

Any other country, having gone through the fighting hell of the last 10 years in Iraq and Afghanistan, would have had their best minds focusing on the why and the how (we know the where) of President Obama's sudden and unexpected announcement. Leaving a country we waged war against, with so little ceremony, deserves hard analysis.

There was some talk about leaving a few American military in Iraq -- it seems to me the number was about 150, but the truth is I never really heard it repeated after that first report about Obama getting mad. Supposedly their job would be to train the Iraqi military. Since so many of "our" Iraqi and Afghan fighters have turned against us, even to the point of killing our men, this idea can only be described as a double-edged sword.

But we will soon know all, for the calendar never stops for any man. December will come, the men and women will leave; January will come, almost all will be home; and then we will need to worry about the 32,000 severely injured Americans from the Iraq war, most of whom will be in the care of the state.

Interesting, how the idiot savants in charge of our economics never seem to figure this amount into the fiscal budget, much less the moral and human budget. Joseph Stiglitz, the brilliant Nobel laureate economist, stated in the very beginning of the war that it, plus the care for injured veterans, would cost America in the trillions of dollars and would mean taking care of veterans with severe wounds all their lives.

Meanwhile, the stupid neocons, whose war it so proudly was, consistently said that the war would pay for itself out of Iraqi oil revenues. The human part of the war equation never seemed to enter their minds.

It occurs to me at this point to compare Vietnam with Iraq. And when I do, most of what I see are differences.

Our soldiers in Vietnam were conscripted; they uniformly hated the war, as I found out when I traveled there as a correspondent. When they came home, they were jeered, not cheered, and had to live with a sense of angry shame. Endless scores of writers and analysts jumped into their memories of the war and analyzed it to death.

Our soldiers in Iraq were all volunteers; from what we can tell so far, they are proud of their service and have, at least to date, bought into the Bush administration's general narrative on the war. They have come home with honor, cheered as "America's warriors"; their biggest problem at home, if they are able-bodied, is a lack of jobs; and to date, few writers and analysts have studied the war and its designers with any depth.

But what will come next for the U.S. military is hard to say. There is a strange growl of anger and discontent that one occasionally hears about the war behind the curtains, and one wonders if it will ever burst forth. One sees the lack of press coverage of virtually anything serious, like the war, and wonders how we will ever emerge from our present national funk without a more intellectual and moral discussion of where we've been.

Fotunately, the Obama administration has begun to show us the way the future could be. The Libyan story is one example, showing how the United States can "lead from behind," or in effect lay out the pattern for success by using the French-led NATO effort to clear the skies above the cities and towns of Libya. This is similar to the equally successful NATO bombing attacks on Serbia in the late 1990s in order to free Kosovo from Serbian oppression.

And if I am not mistaken, this kind of thinking is behind the recent Pentagon decision to send American advisers to aid Uganda in the fight to defeat Joseph Kony, the mad, perverted mass murderer, and his euphemistically named "Lord's Resistance Army," which kidnaps children from villages and forces them to kill their parents.

The future will not be kind to us if we do not absorb the past. At the moment, we know more about Herman Cain than about the realities of Iraq.

It's sad, but a good political scandal outranks historical achievement.  Pray that our brave young men and women all come home and that those who need our nation's appreciation and support will not be let down.

Thomas Jefferson said  "A nations best defense is an educated citizenry." If we EVER had an educated citizenry that time is long past. And we now follow our leaders like sheep to the slaughter. Only an imbecile would believe the ill-considered opinions of the Bush administration that led us into the Iraqi quagmire. But in we went and in we stayed for ten long years. I don't care about parsing the reasons why we are leaving or about who is responsible for it. Trust me! Our troops know about it and, say it aloud or not, the sane ones are thanking God its almost over. I am a closet Nam Vet who did my job and was glad when it was over. Declare Victory if you need to. I didn't care how it ended...with a bang or a whimper. And neither do most Iraqi  War vets. Just let them come home to their families!

Ms. Geyer laments the fact that there is more media coverage of Herman Cain's latest fiasco than of our upcoming withdrawal from Iraq. Yes, that's disturbing, but it doesn't even come close to the disparity between coverage of really important national news and ridiculous fluff like the Kim Kardashian divorce. I once saw a poster for a journalism course that asked, "When did the fake news become more important than the real news?" It should have read, "Why did the fake news become more important than the real news?"

The media is engaged in a "wag the dog" scenario with Cain-hoping everybody will focus on his shortcomings so he loses credibility.  Then they will hit Perry and Romney with everything they got, so Obama's disastrous economy and slipshod, hamhanded foreign policies is virtually ignored, leading to an easy re-election.

If you think our withdrawal from Iraq is overshadowed by the Cain coverage, consider that there have only been FIVE comments on this article, while there are over SIX THOUSAND about some ditzy woman who spent eight days wandering around an airport trying to drum up thirty bucks for her extra bag fee. Only in America could either event happen. What ever happened to IMPORTANT NEWS and INFORMED READERS?

Without Iraq, Libya would not have happened.  Geyer takes too much for granted and too easily throws around words like "idiot" and "stupid".  Her way is to never do anything even if the Chinese horde is knocking her own door down.  Surveillance, drones, intel, better weapons and techniques all came from our experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Geyer thinks these things would have arisen out of the ether.   She is cynical too.

Best thing about his article is that she's mad.  "The stupid neocons."

The author sensed correctly that the media is "owned" and they are throwing dust in our eyes, all at the same time. While hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost, other people are crippled for life, millions of people and whole countries are impoverished and wrecked because of these wars, all they find to talk about is Cain patting/not patting some crazy bimbo.

All these overt or covert wars the US and NATO are waging in Africa, the ME and Europe, are aimed at imposing Sharia-based Islamic regimes by force.

Proof of the media cover-up is that even the author is being ignorant about the Kosovo conflict. "Freeing Kosovo from the Serbian oppressors" ?! Nothing could be more a lie than that. The Kosovo conflict is about Albanian colonists came up hundreds of years ago with the Muslim invasions in Europe and the Serbs let them stay there after Kosovo has been liberated. Just like Israel let the Arab colonists stay in Israel after Israel has been liberated from the Egyptian and the Jordanian occupation. Now the Muslim Albanians left in Kosovo, want Kosovo for themselves and they want all the Christian Serbs evicted from their own land, and Kosovo a Sharia-based Islamic Republic. NATO and the US bombed and killed the Christian Serbs, in order for the Albanian Muslims to become an Islamic State and evict the Serbs ! How come is that ?

Islam has nothing, nothing to do with Democracy. It is a Religious Dictatorship. Why would the "Democratic" countries kill people in order to sustain the propagation of the Islamic States ?

Why nobody realizes that Islam is against any Democratic Constitution ? Even violently against. The Koran is used by the Saudi Arabia as a Constitution. Check that out if you don't believe ! You cannot swear on two Constitutions at the same time ! Islam is a religious State !

The US is fighting on behalf of Islamism ! How is that possible and the media is only throwing dust in our eyes !

Try references: article "Islam 101" on the Jihadwatch site.

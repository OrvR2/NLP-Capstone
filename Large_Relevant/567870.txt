Hi. I’m a 16 year old DJ/Producer with 1 years experience. I know there’s a lot of comments like these and this can frustrate some people. We only have one shot at﻿ life and this is what I would like to do with it. It means the world to me if you check out my channel and music. I have only been producing for 1 year so I’m not at a professional﻿ level.
Please like this comment so people can see. Just one click can change my life.
Thanks so much for your time :)

Nobody can make that shot in one try, so obviously it took multiple﻿ takes. Even if did take him 297 tries that is still an impressive shot, I would like to see how many tries it would take you to make that shot because I bet it would be a hell of a lot more than 297.

It took less than 10 tries! In an interview with TexAgs, the guys from Dude perfect did not want to try it because they thought it was﻿ too difficult and would take too long.

the videos are awesome, but they just show the ONE time out of HUNDREDS of shots that make it. If they made﻿ a video showing how many times they had to throw the balls, it wouldn't be all that impressive...

"The 'even longer shot' from the top of Kyle Field took less than 10 tries. They started by throwing Nerf footballs, but then Manziel decided he wanted to put the football through the net. They didn't think that there was anyway﻿ a shot would be made from the top of Kyle Field. However, after climbing to the top, Manziel threw the ball as hard as he could and missed the goal by 10 feet. At that point, they knew hitting the shot would be possible..." From a TexAgs story.

The reason why he "supermans" is because Cam Newton is his favorite player. that is one of the reasons why wears 2. the other is bc of derek jeter. i think is was overused in this video but it is﻿ a great celebration and i really doubt cam newton has a problem with the best player in college using his celebration.

You're right, because a bunch of Christian guys would rip off hundreds of dollars from their sponsors, then give that to charity. Not to mention the fact that Johnny Freaking Football, The first and only ever Freshman Heisman would go out of his way to lie to everyone who watched this﻿ video to make a couple hundred bucks which might also go to a charity... Please do some research before you comment saying that something is fake.
I am George Washington and I approve this message.

The "even longer shot" took less than 10 tries fyi...started out w nerf footballs until Manziel wanted to go for goal w real football.﻿ First throw was off by about 10 feet, so they knew it was possible but thought was still a waste of time to try. Until Johnny did it.

Exactly! And to think the media hype for Manti was to over the top it wasn't funny. The Heisman is for the best player. Not the﻿ best sob story. Lots of people have played through bad times and deserve kudos for doing so, but they don't deserve the award for being the best player.

Johnny Manziel makes me wish I were an Aggie fan. I am a fan of one of the﻿ teams he lost to this year. I'm glad we got him when we could (his first game). Still though - he is Johnny Football and you expect him to be incredible - but who is this "Dude Perfect"? This is my first stumble onto your videos. This stuff is awesome!

I love the Gators, but I also love college football. I know our rivalries and to me, I can hate a helmet with﻿ the best of them. But I still respect (and often like) the opposing players. TAMU belongs in the SEC and they are an exciting add out West. We don't have to play you guys next year. I'm not sorry about that at all. Have fun next season!

No one told me that January is the wrong time to visit Normandy (until afterwards, that is). Most of the places we went to visit were closed. It was cold and wet and rainy. It took more than three hours each way. But I haven't been to France in fifteen years, and who knows (especially after this trip) when I will go again.
Our driver was an older gentleman, a retired executive who kept himself busy as a tour guide. As we left Paris, he enthusiastically pointed out the sights. This palace and that. This chalet and that. Napoleons' and Louis' and the rest. I finally told him, nicely, that as Americans, we had a somewhat different attitude toward kings. When that didn't work, I told him we'd be closing our eyes.
But as we got closer and found one place after another closed down, I started asking questions. He was old enough to remember World War II, or at least to have learned about it, as I did, from my parents and relatives who fought in the war. His father was a doctor, from right there.
I guess I should have known.
France had stayed out of the war, wisely he thought. After all, look at how many French soldiers died in World War I. Marshall Petain, soldier, appeaser, chief of state of Vichy France, was right to make his peace with Hitler in 1940. Look how many lives he saved. It hardly seemed right that he was prosecuted for treason after the war.
What about the Jews? I asked him. Really, he didn't know. Didn't know?
There were many righteous men and women in France who tried to save their Jewish countrymen and -women. Clearly, that did not include my driver's family. Nor the Vichy government. All told, 76,000 Jews were sent to concentration camps in France. Refugees were among the first to be rounded up. Pity those who thought they would find refuge from Hitler in France. They were as much in the dark as I was. They paid with their lives. All but 2,500 of those sent to the camps in France died.
The only place open was the American cemetery and the small museum adjacent to it. Our driver apologized. It hardly seemed worth the trip, he said. Wrong again.
You might remember the cemetery from the opening scenes in "Saving Private Ryan."
But seeing it is different.
I stood there with my 18-year-old son. The rain poured down. We stared at row after row of crosses, interspersed with stars of David. The museum, simple, powerful, told the story of these brave Americans, many of them no older than my son.
Omaha Beach is quiet. Even on a rainy day, it is beautiful. But it was not beautiful on D-Day. The ocean was dyed red with the blood of brave Americans who waded from their boats into enemy fire — kids who gave their lives to save each other, to liberate the French, to defeat evil.
On that day, as the tape in the museum says, they carried the fate of the free world — "the entire free world" — on their young shoulders.
They saved the world.
My friend Annie was the one who told me to go to Normandy. She is the child of survivors, born in Munich after the war. She said that standing in that cemetery, she was overcome with pride to be an immigrant to this country.
For all our problems, we are still the luckiest people on the face of the globe. And one of the reasons for that is because of those young soldiers who gave their lives for our freedom — and for the freedom of people like my driver and his family. He may not know enough to appreciate that. But I do. God bless America.

It should be remembered that this gigantic effort was done by young men and women that weren't in a well-paid professional Army. It was done by volunteers and draftees that recognized Evil when they saw it, and for love of country and each other, decided it needed to be stamped out. I'd like to think that the young people of today still have that same grit.... But  in this world of leisure and high tech toys; sometimes I wonder.... Nice piece Ms. Estrich!

I am reminded of an old joke of the WWII US Army vet visiting France many years after the war.  After landing, while going through Customs, he was asked if he had ever been to France before.  And the old vet said yes.  The French Customs officer asked him why his passport was not stamped indicating the prior visit and the old vet retorted that the last time he had been in France, there were no Frenchmen anywhere to be found.  The Customs officer cannot believe such a thing.  It must be a lie.  Surely there was some French person about.  The old vet said no, he was part of a group that came ashore June 6, 1944 and there were definitely no French to be found.

i often wondered why the success of d day hinged on omaha beach when the other beach landings were successful ?

the drive does not represent the all the people in France. I was part of the 50th Anniversary celebrations in 1994. The people of France opened their homes to us and took in WWII vets.  They still do.
Now where you clowns come off with "liberals" and crap I have no idea. I guess it is because you slept through your US history classes or watch too much Fox News.
  As for the writer it is very telling that she wasn't interested in the history of the man's country.  How rude of her. But what do you expect of a spoiled brat.  Like most of you would ever go fight for the US unless you were drafted and then you would work your rear off trying to find a way out.
  A lot of Allied troops hit those beaches on the morning of June 6th.  And a lot of them died.  There are other cemetaries in the area. For all allied and Axis troops.  They are just as somber and just as sad.  
  I have personaly interviewed allied vets and German WWII vets.  All of them agree that war is a waste.
  But I seriously doubt any of you, including the writer would ever actually try and sit down and talk to a WWII vet.....you have your "reality" shows to watch and your computer games to play and your iphones to bury your faces in..

Well written Susan- for a change-she what you can accomplish when you get off your liberal talking points. As for the ones who criticized you for not mentioning the English etc. troops- you were writing about American soldiers, not the united troops in general-they need to realize that. My father's unit wasn't sent in on D-Day, Patton's 3rd Army went ashore days later but when he returned to France and Germany in his 60s, and 70s, he honored the sacrifice of those who were first in the field and was grateful that he didn't have to be among them because the horror they experienced was so terrible. It was bad enough for him when everyone in his platoon except himself and one other trooper died or was wounded and he went from private to sargeant by war's end. So keep honoring those valiant who faced the hell for the liberation of Europe  even if people forget the facts.

It's a lot more fun to travel if you take an interest in the history of the region even if "as Americans, we had a somewhat different attitude toward kings".  You will also find that the locals are more interested in being friendly and helpful if you take an interest.

A couple of years ago, I got to tour Normandy with a man whom served in the 101st for most of that unit's campaigns in Europe. (yes, we verified his story before going.).  There was no great introspective moment, just a number of little ones that showed that despite what was accomplished, those that fought were just glad to see the next day, were not worried about the greater issues, and for many, only wanted to come home.

I was in France in 1970.  Even then the younger generation in France felt that DeGaulle had walked ashore at Normandy and the Germans ran for home.  It was only in talking with the older generation in France who had actually lived through the war, was there any appreaciation for the blood and money spent to free France.  Those people would be of the age of our WW II veterans and are dying off at a high rate due to their ages.  The tour guides attitudes and beliefs do not surprise me.  It was common enough in 1970 and has only gotten worse in the ensuing 40 years.

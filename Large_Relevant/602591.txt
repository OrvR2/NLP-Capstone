HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) — The first woman scheduled to be executed in the U.S. since 2010 won a reprieve Tuesday, mere hours before she was scheduled to be taken to the Texas death chamber.
State District Judge Larry Mitchell, in Dallas, rescheduled Kimberly McCarthy's punishment for April 3 so lawyers for the former nursing home therapist could have more time to pursue an appeal focused on whether her predominantly white jury was improperly selected on the basis of race. McCarthy is black.
Dallas County prosecutors, who initially contested the motion to reschedule, chose to not appeal the ruling.
District Attorney Craig Watkins said the 60-day delay was "appropriate." If no irregularities are discovered, he said he'd move forward with the execution.
"We want to make sure everything is done correctly," he said.
The 51-year-old McCarthy was convicted and sent to death row for the 1997 stabbing, beating and robbery of a 71-year-old neighbor. She learned of the reprieve less than five hours before she was scheduled for lethal injection, already in a small holding cell a few feet from the death chamber at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Huntsville Unit.
"I'm happy right now over that," she told prison agency spokesman John Hurt. "There's still work to be done on my case."
Hurt said McCarthy was in good spirits and "didn't seem tense or nervous" even before she learned she would live.
A Dallas County jury convicted her of killing neighbor Dorothy Booth at the retired college psychology professor's home in Lancaster, about 15 miles south of Dallas.
"We are very pleased that we will now have an opportunity to present evidence of discrimination in the selection of the jury that sentenced Kimberly McCarthy to death," said Maurie Levin, a University of Texas law professor and McCarthy's lawyer.
"Of the twelve jurors seated at trial, all were white, except one, and eligible non-white jurors were excluded from serving by the state. ... These facts must be understood in the context of the troubling and long-standing history of racial discrimination in jury selection in Dallas County, including at the time of Ms. McCarthy's trial," Levin said.
Investigators said Booth had agreed to give McCarthy a cup of sugar before she was attacked with a butcher knife and candelabra. Booth's finger also was severed so McCarthy could take her wedding ring. It was among three slayings linked to McCarthy, who'd been addicted to crack cocaine.
McCarthy would have been the 13th woman executed in the U.S. and the fourth in Texas, the nation's busiest death penalty state, since the Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976. In that same time period, more than 1,300 male inmates have been executed nationwide.
Federal Bureau of Justice Statistics compiled from 1980 through 2008 show women make up about 10 percent of homicide offenders nationwide. According to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, 3,146 people were on the nation's death rows as of Oct. 1, and only 63 — 2 percent — were women.

She cut off the woman's finger to get her ring. No, I don't think that the race of the jurors had anything to do with it. And this wasn't the first old lady she killed. She just keeps getting off on technicalities.

At 68, I can barely imagine the terror her victim must have felt at just 3 years younger, I feel a major shift of knowing I couldn't fight my way out of a paper bag any more.  Of course as a woman, it's not a new feeling, just worse...  I couldn't run too far either, because I'd run out of oxygen line, (same reason I can't play hide and seek, actually) My Mom is still alive we talked about this.  She couldn't even afford to fall down just once.  She feels so frail and helpless, crime and its cruelty frightens her so much.  It's amazing really, how much safer she felt with my 90+ bed ridden father still alive...:) habit I guess.   I may be physically of little use, but I have a very huge dog (124 lbs) and I can chamber my gun in my sleep.  This beast of a woman was such a coward to take that seniors remaining life from her.  And the lowest part of all of it was that she destroyed this woman by using her own kindness and naiveté against her.  Dorothy Booth opened the door to share some of her sugar with Kimberly Mcarthy because she was kind. She might have lived to be 90, who knows what she missed in that time.  Kimberly should be executed at soon as legally possible.  She lived a long time after she murdered a helpless old woman...too long.

Newsflash: this woman didn't get convicted because she was black. She got convicted because she was guilty if unthinkable and heinous crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.

wait what?  If you put me on  jury, and present me with a white woman who did this and a black woman, my answer would be exactly the same - fry the witch.  What does her being black have to do with her being a murderer?  I AM a white woman - I'll happily convict one of my own, I don't care *what* color they are under the blood!

Committed the crime in 1997 and we are still paying her medical bills, dental plan, room and board and probably a retirement plan.  This is what is wrong with this country.  We are so politically correct, we are being bankrupted by murderers and rapists.  As long as there is no justice, their will be no freedom for the law abiding people.

Wow.....after reading some of the comments here, there's nothing left to say except she should have been executed a long time ago. I'm tired of society paying for murderers upkeep, food, medical and yes...education. It's a double slap in the face to the victims families and to society.

That was someone's mother. This gross individual should have been executed regardless if she were black or white. She took the life of another for which there was no excuse. She was tried and convicted. Why 15 years later do they think the possibility of discrimination? She has had 15 years to appeal and didn't. Now she gets a stay for 90 days, imagine that.

Are they not denying she is guilty, just saying that if the jurors were black, they would somehow condone murder ?

Race had nothing to do with it, it was a brutal murder, they also execute whites as well, so that excuse won't work

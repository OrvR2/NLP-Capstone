Boeing 787 investigation making progress: NTSBBy Andrea Shalal-Esa | Reuters – 9 hrs ago

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials on Friday said they are making progress in their investigation of a battery fire on a Boeing Co 787 Dreamliner in Boston this month, as the grounding of Boeing's entire fleet Of 787s stretched into a third week.
              All 50 Boeing 787s remain grounded as authorities in the United States, Japan and France investigate the Boston battery fire on January 7 and a separate battery failure that forced a second 787 to make an emergency landing in Japan a week later.
              The U.S. safety board said it continued to look at flight data recorded aboard the 787 aircraft involved in the January 7 event at Boston airport for any information about the performance of the lithium-ion battery that caught fire, and its charging system, which was built by Securaplane, a unit of Britain's Meggitt Plc .
              "Our investigators are moving swiftly and we are making progress," Kelly Nantel, a spokeswoman for the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, said after the U.S. safety board issued a seventh update on the investigation. She did not elaborate.
              Boeing welcomed the news and said it continued to work closely with authorities in the United States and Japan.
              The NTSB said an expert from the Department of Energy had joined the investigation, and an NTSB investigator would travel to France on Sunday or Monday with a "battery contactor", which connects the battery to the planes' electrical systems, for further tests at the equipment's manufacturer, Thales SA .
              The NTSB experts at the U.S. Naval Surface Warfare Center laboratories were continuing to look at a second, undamaged lithium-ion battery pulled from the same Japan Airlines  plane. Both batteries were built by GS Yuasa , a Japanese company.
              Initial tests, including infrared thermal imaging of each cell in the undamaged battery, found no anomalies, according to the NTSB update. It said the battery's eight cells were undergoing another scan to examine their internal condition.
              U.S., Japanese and French safety inspectors - aided by industry officials - have been trying to determine what caused the battery fire on the 787 in Boston and a separate battery failure in Japan that involved smoke the following week.
              The failure of investigators to identify the root cause of the incidents has sparked concerns that the 787 grounding will last longer, and hit Boeing and the airlines that operate the 787 harder than expected.
              But Boeing's chief executive, Jim McNerney, told investors this week that the company planned to speed up production of the jet as planned, and had not seen any reason to question its use of lithium ion batteries on the 787.
              Boeing's shares closed 1.35 percent higher at $74.87 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
              Neither the NTSB, nor the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which is looking at a broader range of problems with the 787, have set timetables for completing their work.
              Investigations are also continuing in Seattle, where Boeing builds the planes, and in Japan.

Most of the comments seem to be from non-engineers who have never gone thru a failure investigation. First you gather all the evidence you can (letting the press spokesman handle the press). Then you evaluate the findings (usually in a group) and develop conclusions. After ascertaining the probable cause you try to recreate the failure so you can come up with a fix.
Then and only then do you announce your findings.

The important thing is to let the engineers work without undue pressure to speculate on the possible cause and solution which only wastes their time and dilutes their effort.

"Our investigators are moving swiftly and we are making progress," but we have no idea what the problem might be.

This problem reminds me of a quote from the BBC television show Top Gear, to paraphrase, batteries are rubbish just waiting to fail.

Anyone who relies on BBC for information or entertainment is not too bright.

Why take a chance? Fly Airbus and be safe and worry free.

A lot of airplanes have had problems in the past, solved the problems and gone on to be good ones. The Lockheed Electra, the Being 727, the DC-10 and others all had teething troubles. I have no doubt this battery problem will be solved as well and than the 787 will be safe and sell great.

Not good for Boeing, however all are doing the right thing in the interest of safety.  They will likely find that it was a manufacturing defect or a connector issue.

Do YOU want to fly in a 787...  I would prefer NOT to be a guinea pig.

An earlier article quoted Yuasa as implying the fault lies in the Meggitt control circuit, while quoting Meggitt as implying Yuasa changed the battery specs without informing them. 
Although the undamaged battery showed no fault in tests, that doesn't rule out the possibility the one that burned had a flaw. Not sure about the application of the second battery within the aircraft, but if it was connected to a separate charging system, then this would direct suspicion back on the charging circuit for the damaged battery.
Only time will tell for sure, as it takes a long time to properly investigate problems like these.

This is how Willie the bean counter measures progress.  Moving swiftly, making progress, and still do not know what the root cause is.  It looks so familiar.

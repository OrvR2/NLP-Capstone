Hayley Williams (of Paramore) is one of 22 contestants in my contest. I am running a contest on YouTube right now and asking the users of YouTube who is the greatest female singer of all-time. Round 6 is commencing right now and the contest is already half﻿ way through with Hayley﻿ still competing in it. If you wish for Hayley to do well in my contest,﻿ start by voting for her in Round 6 and see if Williams can win it all. My contest has gathered up over 100,000+ hits so far. Please support it.

Love it! This is great!! I was brought to this video through a suggestion while watching Brittany Kwasnik Across The Ocean (who reminds me so much of the older Paramore) anyway this song is awesome and I'm﻿ glad I ended up here!! If you love Paramore as much as I do you should take a listen to Across The Ocean... I'm sure you'll love it too

Paramore has saved my life. They've been there from the beginning, they give﻿ me a reason to carry on. When I listen to any of their songs and I immediately get lost in the music, I forget all of the pain and worries. I love you with all of my heart, it beats for only you <3

Maybe I'm just a dreamer, but I'm not the only one Please, just give me 1 chance to prove myself to you
I love music and I had fun doing it.
I make acoustic covers and I’d like that you stop by my channel and check it out
You don't have to like me, just give me a chance to prove my talent
Thank you!

Some of us use it as a term of empowerment. We laugh in the faces of idiots who think we will be hurt by a word.
You have no idea what you are﻿ talking about. Unless you're gay yourself, why do you pretend to know anything about us? I'm not the idiot here.

Well, since you're actually trying to make him look stupid because of his typos, then you should check yours first. There should be a comma between "spell" and "faggot", but﻿ I am pretty sure he knows how to spell "faggot", and clearly so do you. But if you mean that he is a faggot, then there should be a comma in there. Don't try to fix on people when you can't fix it yourself - it's just making you look silly. This song does NOT suck though, but every thought - every snowflake.

This﻿ song Rocks*. Its completely understandable for you to make such a grammar mistake, the letters are so close together and you were probably typing too fast :) but not to worry, I fixed that mispelled word of yours. ^-^

Hello People
Before you ignore me please just give me a chance
I love singing since I was a little girl and it became my biggest passion
Some people are trying to put me down but I keep my head up and keep doing what I love to do
Singing I can be who really I am and I have fun doing it.
I recorded some acoustic covers and I’d like that you stop by my channel and check it out
You don't have to like me, just give me a chance to prove my talent
Thank﻿ you!

Some people aren't die-hard fans, they just like 1 or 2 songs. I'm like that.﻿ No need to sound mean, but I have no need to know their names, I just like the music they make.

I’m learning everyday and working really hard at what I do, I know I’m not perfect, but I really want to do things I love. It’s my dream.

Correcto. Did you read﻿ what the Farro bros said about the rest of the band after they left? It's hilarious. Judging by this super-mediocre song, I'd say the band's pretty much lost it once they lost them.

If you are using gay in a derogatory sense, of course it's an insult. Plus it makes﻿ you sounds like a ten year old.

What's the problem with the way he/she uses the word gay. It means happy. And for half﻿ a century, it's been used like the word sucks. He/she is obviously saying that JB appears to him/her as a homosexual.

Actually you may want to be﻿ happy, everyone listens to the song in the credits, but the songs in the movie were simply just white noise during the action and violence.

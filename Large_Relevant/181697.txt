Discovered: The predictable race and political affiliation of "reverse racism" victims; car crashes are more deadly for the morbidly obese; ADHD on the rise in high-income minority communities; plain labeling could cut smoking rates.

'Reverse racism' mostly targets white Republicans. It's really hard being a white Republican, according to all the white Republicans claiming to be victims of "reverse racism." Stanford University researchers studied how people perceive this problem, in which people historically responsible for perpetrating racism supposedly get the tables turned on themselves, finding that the groups most likely to believe they're victims of such discrimination are conservative Caucasians and southern Evangelicals. "We talk about whites who claim reverse discrimination a lot, but we don't often study them systematically," says Stanford sociology professor Aliya Saperstein. "The issue of reporting racial discrimination is such a loaded one. So, we were curious about who the white people were who would say out loud to a survey interviewer that they had been treated unfairly because of their race." [Stanford University]

Car crashes are more dangerous for obese people. You might think that thin people lacking in adipose cushioning would be more vulnerable to getting seriously hurt in a car crash than heftier drivers—but you'd be wrong. According to a new study published in Emergency Medical Journal, morbidly obese people were were 80 percent more likely to die in a car crash compared with those of normal weight. Those with a BMI in the "obese range" were still 20 percent more likely to perish in an automobile collision. The researchers pointed to cardiac problems as a mitigating factor in this phenomenon. Underweight people were also more likely to die in a collision than those of normal weight—but only if they were men. [Scientific American]

ADHD is a growing problem for high-income minority children. Many people have considered ADHD to be a problem that disproportionately affects low-income kids, but new findings published in JAMA Pediatrics finds that the attention disorder also affects high-income children. But it's much more pronounced in high-income minority groups than it is for whites, according to Kaiser Permanente researchers. ADHD diagnoses in African American children went up 70 percent between 2001 and 2010. It increased by 60 percent among Latino children in the same period. The problem could be attributed to better diagnosis rather than higher incidence, the researchers note. The trend, "likely represent[s] an effort by these highly educated parents to seek help for their children who may not be fulfilling their expectations for schoolwork," they write. [Los Angeles Times]

Make cigarette packaging less colorful, and people might stop smoking. If cigarette packs were stripped of their bright colors and bold logos, would people be less interested in buying tobacco products? A new study led by the University of Cambridge's Theresa Marteau finds evidence that it very well might. After two years of requiring generic packaging for cigarettes, the number of smokers would drop by one percentage point, and the number of children who start smoking would decline by three points, according to Marteau's model. "Currently, approximately 10 million adults in Britain smoke," Marteau notes. "A one percentage point decline—from 21 percent of the population to 20 percent—would equate to 500,000 people who will not suffer the health effects of smoking." [University of Cambridge]

I''m starting a club titled "The society for the preservation of the white male." How much do you want to bet that members of the black caucus in congress will be some of the first ones to call my club racist?

If you don't think black people are just as racist as white people, then you are an idiot.

Blacks will take the same written test as Whites, say for like a police or fire department, for say a promotions list. And then complain about low test scores, then turn around and file complaints against the departments, then no one gets promoted with the departments.

The author is only a LITTLE biased, right?  At least make an attempt not to show bias and contempt.  Of course, I'm NOT a republican (but I am "white" although my grandparents were all immigrants at the bottom of the economic ladder).  I will say that I have definitely seen reverse discrimination due to being a straight white male working in a firm that has MAJOR internal affirmative action programs for women, ethnic minorities, LGBT, etc.  Once we have "enough" promotions for the "special" groups then the white males get to compete for the leftovers.

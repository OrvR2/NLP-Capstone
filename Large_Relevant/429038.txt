Mike Tyson to launch children’s charityBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Nov 20, 2012Tweet0

Mike Tyson, who once threatened to eat an opponent's children, is launching a charity foundation for kids.
The former world heavyweight champion and star of a recent one-man show is set to launch the foundation—Mike Tyson Cares—next month in Las Vegas.
According to Tyson, the charity's mission is to "give kids a fighting chance" and will focus on at-risk children "from broken homes" in the Las Vegas area.
The foundation will kick off with a gala party on Dec. 7 at the MGM Grand. As part of the launch, Tyson is also auctioning off ringside seats next to his for the Dec. 8 fight between Manny Pacquiao and Juan Manuel Marquez.

"I want my legacy to be about charity and helping children," Tyson said in a press release announcing the launch event. "This is my start."
In April, the rapist turned pigeon handler launched a one-man stage show—"The Undisputed Truth"—that chronicled tales of Tyson's drug use as well as his numerous sexcapades. (The show later made a limited run on Broadway.)

Hospital worker swam to work after SandyBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Nov 20, 2012Tweet0

After the destruction of superstorm Sandy, many on the East Coast had no choice but to skip work.  But emergency room technician Marsha Hedgepeth of Toms River, N.J., wasn't about to miss her shift. The roads were flooded, so Hedgepeth swam part of the way to work.
In an interview with Asbury Park Press, Hedgepeth said, "I dove into water, and I couldn't see the steps I was walking down because they were covered in water. So I said the easiest way to get there is just swim until I reach the ground."

Fortunately, Hedgepeth didn't have to swim the entire way. The experienced surfer swam about 200 yards through murk and debris. After reaching a nearby highway, she hitched a ride with utility workers. She arrived about six hours before her shift was set to begin.
Hedgepeth tried to call the hospital to see if she was needed, but she (along with millions of others) had no telephone service. The 43-year-old said, "You know you just have to be there. You're

Anderson Cooper’s Twitter feudBy Claudine Zap | The Sideshow – Tue, Nov 20, 2012Tweet0

(Anderson Cooper reporting from Gaza while dodging explosions.)
Forget about the conflict in the Middle East. It's a Twitter war that has Anderson Cooper riled up.
While reporting and dodging explosions in Gaza—ground zero of renewed hostilities between Israel and Hamas—the host of "AC360" took an in-coming tweet from one Pamela Weiss, a self-described "social media junkie" and "foodie."
As surfaced by Tumblr, Weiss criticized his report of an Israeli airstrike on a  media center, twice in one day.  She posted, "Report a fair story. Report facts."
Amazingly, the TV anchor noticed the tweet (he has more than 3.3 million followers) and replied, "ummmm.... I just did that and have been doing that repeatedly on twitter and on tv. Do you actually think before you tweet?"
But there was more cattiness to come. Cooper added, "perhaps spend less time tweeting about coconut flan and more time actually following the news."
Followers of the Twitter spat weighed in. Caleb ‏@cpenny20 posted,  "damn

Newark Mayor Cory Booker preparing to live a week on food stampsBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Nov 20, 2012Tweet0

Cory Booker, America's favorite mayor and occasional superhero, is preparing to live for a week or more on food stamps—if his challenge to a Twitter user is accepted.
The challenge came when the Newark mayor got into a tête-à-tête on Twitter about the role of government in funding food programs for schoolchildren.
"We have a shared responsibility that kids go to school nutritionally ready," Booker wrote on Sunday after a follower tweeted nutrition "is not a responsibility of the government."
Booker—who said last week that superstorm Sandy prompted him to postpone his  decision to run for New Jersey governor against Chris Christie—then responded to a tweet from another follower who doubted there are families "'too poor' to afford breakfast."
"[Let's] you and I try to live on food stamps in New Jersey (high cost of living) and feed a family for a week or month," the mayor wrote. "U game?"
The user, "TwitWit," replied, "Sure, Mayor, I'm game."
"Great. Let's do this," Booker wrote. "I hope you live in New Jersey. Let's film it and see how we do."
Booker added that they would have to get a referee.

Paula Broadwell reportedly vowed in an email to make Jill Kelley "go away" the New York Daily News reported Tuesday in a story offering new details about how the mistress of former CIA Director David Petraeus threatened Kelley.
Kelley, a Florida socialite who sparked the Petraeus scandal, reportedly viewed the then-anonymous messages as "death threats" from someone "clearly unhinged," according to an unnamed friend who spoke to the newspaper. Broadwell wrote she would "make [Kelley] go away" in one message.
"In other emails, Broadwell, a West Point graduate, touted her military background in a threatening manner and boasted of having 'powerful' friends," the Daily News reported. Kelley was "scared for her life," the friend claimed.

Store gives away free groceries after registers stop workingBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Sideshow – Tue, Nov 20, 2012Tweet0
With Thanksgiving fast approaching, grocery stores are doing a brisk business. It's not a good time for a computer glitch that keeps customers in line with time to wonder if they really need 12 cans of cranberry sauce. But snafus do happen.
This past weekend, at a Harris Teeter grocery store in Charlotte, N.C., the registers went on strike. Each and every one stopped working at once. Cashiers couldn't sell people their groceries, and as the lines grew longer, the store manager made a very popular decision: free groceries for all 60-70 customers waiting in line.
The Charlotte Observer reported the grocery store closed while repairs were made. Customer David Coburn told the Observer, "Harris Teeter handled it really well. They showed how much they cared about their customers and even the customers were—for the most part—taking it in stride."
"Terminator 2" was eerily prescient. The machines are taking over. And they want you to have free groceries.

Mitt Romney seen pumping gas in La JollaBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! NewsSenior Media ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Dylan Stableford, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Nov 20, 2012Tweet0

Aside from a controversial conference call with donors, Mitt Romney has kept a low profile since losing the 2012 presidential election to Barack Obama.
The former Republican nominee was spotted with his wife, Ann, at a screening of the new "Twilight" movie, "Breaking Dawn — Part 2," in Del Mar, Calif., on Saturday. According to TMZ, the pair later "hit up a pizza place across the street."
On Monday, a photograph of Romney filling up at a gas station in La Jolla, Calif., was posted to Reddit.com.
"Mitt Romney at my local gas station," Reddit user mkb95 wrote. "He looks tired and washed up."
Romney's hair appears to be slightly frazzled, unlike the slicked-back coif he sported on the trail—though it's nothing like Al Gore's post-2000-election-loss beard. Other Reddit users countered that the former Massachusetts governor merely looked annoyed at having his photo taken at the pump.
"I talked to him for a good  three minutes while he was filling his tank," the photographer added. "I guess he's moving to one of his houses in the town I live in, La Jolla."

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla.—Florida Republican Rep. Allen West conceded to Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy on Tuesday, two weeks after the Nov. 6 election.
West challenged the results that showed him about 2,000 votes short of Murphy in Florida's 18th Congressional District but was unable to persuade local officials to grant him a full recount. He released a statement on Tuesday saying he plans to take "no further action to contest the outcome of  this election."
"For two weeks since Election Day, we have been working to ensure every  vote is counted accurately and fairly. We have made progress towards  that goal, thanks to the dedication of our supporters and their  unrelenting efforts to protect the integrity of the democratic process,"  West said in a statement. "While many questions remain unanswered, today I am  announcing that I will take no further action to contest the outcome of  this election."
West was first elected in 2010 with a groundswell of support from local tea

Tuesday in politics: Obama at Asia summit, Clinton heads to Middle East, and moreBy Phil Pruitt | The Ticket – Tue, Nov 20, 2012Tweet0

Foreign policy is the main topic on the politics scene again on Tuesday.
President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended the Association of Southeast Asian Nations East Asia Summit in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Obama also planned sideline meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda and outgoing Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. Obama urged Asian leaders to rein in tensions in the South China Sea.
Clinton, meanwhile, left the summit early to travel to the Middle East in an effort to stop the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. She is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, Palestinian officials in Ramallah and Egyptian leaders in Cairo.

Bidens host wounded warriors for Thanksgiving dinnerBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! NewsWhite House CorrespondentPostsBy Olivier Knox, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Mon, Nov 19, 2012Tweet0
Joe Biden talks with Marine Lance Cpl. Nathan Jakubisin. (AP/Cliff Owen)The mouth-watering smells of stuffing and turkey, a crackling fire, guests with bowed heads giving thanks for "second chances"—Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden hosted their fourth Early Thanksgiving for Wounded Warriors on Monday, welcoming servicemen and -women and loved ones to the Naval Observatory.
"Jill and I want to welcome you to the vice president's home. This is your home," Biden said in brief remarks as the 26 guests sat at two large tables in the residence's dining room. He spoke from behind a lectern with the VP's seal on it, Jill Biden at his side. Candles fluttered over their shoulders on the mantelpiece of the fireplace, in which a robust blaze was already crackling. A Navy harpist played before his remarks.
The vice president said he and his wife were "honored and, quite frankly, flattered" to host the dinner. "It's one of the highlights and honors of this job."
"We're just so incredibly proud of you," Biden said. "We can never—and I mean this sincerely—never, ever repay you and your families for the sacrifices you've made."

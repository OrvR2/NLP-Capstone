NEWTOWN, Conn.--The families and friends of two little boys killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings poured into funeral homes Monday as the first of the massacre's victims were laid to rest.
Jack Pinto and Noah Pozner, both age 6, were remembered at separate services. Both boys were killed in a mass shooting Friday at the school, one of the worst in U.S. history. 26 people died, including 20 children.
On Main Street in Newtown, mourners strolled somberly in a cold drizzle to Honan Funeral Home to remember Jack. An obituary published over the weekend called him "an incredibly loving and vivacious young boy."
Classmates and sports teammates were among those who came to pay their respects. Members of his wresting team wore their club T-shirts and letter jackets.
On a sidewalk, a father knelt down to comfort his son who was wiping tears with his shirt sleeve before entering the service.
A group of teens from a local choir quietly sang church hymns for those waiting to get inside the historic two-story funeral home.
A police car was parked in the street out front to help maintain order and the family's wishes for a private service. Plain-clothed detectives in trench coats also combed the area for extra security.
A grieving woman arrived in the building's driveway to hand funeral directors a small black and red dress for another victim, a grim nod to the services yet to come. Funerals for some of the 12 little girls killed in the attack are scheduled later this week.

In Fairfield, close to 100 relatives and family friends of 6-year-old Noah began arriving at 10 a.m. at Abraham L. Green & Son Funeral Home for a 1 p.m. service. They waited in damp, cold temperatures outside the building for a bomb sweep before Gov. Dan Molloy arrived. Connecticut Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal were also in attendance.
At one point, a Fairfield Police officer was dispatched by a state trooper to fetch the rabbi, who was stuck in traffic nearby.
A half dozen satellite trucks were parked across the street, with dozens of TV cameras on tripods focused on the funeral home.
Noah was remembered in an obituary as "smart as a whip" and devoted to his twin sister, Arielle, who was in another classroom and survived the shooting.
At approximately 2:20 p.m., a motorcade led by a dozen police motorcycles exited the funeral home heading for Monroe, where Pozner will be buried. A woman wearing nurse scrubs watching the scene was overcome with grief at the sight of the hearse carrying the 6-year-old's casket, collapsing in tears on sidewalk as it drove away.
She was consoled by her co-workers, lifted up and led away before television crews could reach her.
Audrey Petschek, from Newtown, did not know the Pozner family but made the 45-minute drive to his funeral because she felt she had to.
"I would go to all of them if I could," Petschek said.
"It was heartbreaking to hear his mother talk about him," she said, "about his video games and his ninja moves."
Dylan Stableford in Fairfield, Conn., contributed reporting.

Death is a part of life but no parent should have to bury their child, especially from a sensless killing. It's not right!

If my words cannot describe the devastation in my heart to these victims I don't even know, I cannot begin to imagine what horror and shock the surviving families must be going through.  Please know the world is with you as your shoulder to cry on, now and always.  This tragic event will not be forgotten, ever.  Knowing heaven gained the purest of angels on 12/14/12 will hopefully help you grieve.  Thoughts and prayers with all those effected.

I hope the media has the decency to stay away from the funerals of those who lost their lives in this tragedy.  The last thing these families need are TV reporters and cameras outside of the churches and funeral homes as they bury their children and loved ones.  Please have some respect!

I really wish the media would leave the mourners alone for just a brief period so they can grieve privately.  I'm glad the local authorities were there to keep them away, even if only for a short time.  RIP little ones. :-(

This is so devastating, I can't begin to fathom how the parents can heal from this loss, or how the surviving children will manage this trauma. My heart goes out to everyone touched by atrocity.

I think everyone has had their share of the Newtown, CT. tragedy. The media now needs to give families privacy to mourn the loss of their loved ones and STOP reporting a blow by blow of every facet of the aftermath.

Rest in Peace you innocent little Angels, perhaps God will make a special Christmas for you in Heaven. God help the parents and relatives of the teachers. God Bless Them All.

I pray that the media will leave these families alone. Enough move on to different news and leave these people in peace.

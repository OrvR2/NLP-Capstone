MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine Congress has approved a bill awarding compensation to thousands of victims of human rights abuses under late President Ferdinand Marcos's 20-year iron rule.
              Under the final version of the bill approved by a bicameral committee late on Wednesday, payments amounting to more than 10 billion pesos ($246 million) to the victims will come from funds recovered by the government from Marcos's ill-gotten wealth.
              The abuses occurred during the period of martial law from September 21, 1972 up to Marcos's downfall on February 25, 1986.
              Victims who can claim compensation include about 10,000 people, subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, torture and execution during the Marcos regime, and their relatives who filed and won a class-action suit against Marcos in 1995 in Hawaii.
 Marcos, who was overthrown in a popular revolt in 1986, fled the country and died in exile in Hawaii.
              The bill needs to be ratified by a plenary session of Congress on Monday before it is signed into law by President Benigno Aquino, whose late father, a former senator critical of Marcos, was assassinated in 1983 at a Manila tarmac upon his return from exile in the United States.
              "We urge Congress to immediately ratify the compensation bill and for President Aquino to sign the bill into law so that the reparation process can start," Neri Colmenares, a party-list representative and one of the proponents of the bill, told reporters.
 Marcos's family has since returned to the Philippines and retains power and influence in the country. His wife Imelda, infamous for her collection of jewelry and shoes, is currently a member of the lower chamber of Congress while his son is a senator.
              In 1997, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court awarded over $600 million in funds, considered to be illegally acquired by Marcos, to the Philippine government.
              The bill provides for the creation of an independent body that will evaluate and process payments to the victims, with compensation to be based on the gravity of abuse they endured.
              ($1 = 40.6300 Philippine pesos)

Freedom is great accept for one problem it leaves the rich with an unbearable monopoly to put their foot on the back of the poor so that they can never get up.They know if they ever get off the ground financialy,the poor man becomes the rich mans worst nightmare.A Real Financial Competitor with a Profit Sharing Crew.

Job creation worldwide is the key but the petroleum industry has to look for ways like China is taking like Going All Electric.The media says vary little about their hydro electric and electric transit.
Philippines could actually generate electricity by moving farm goods down to their coastal exports.Any foreign investors Cut And Run with the profits of most all job creation there.

Johnny its media promoted.Watch the movie inception.We just watched half of America get convinced that their taxes went up when they were actually cut more.Tell someone nothing happened during pole shift then evade subjects like near mis meteors,samontra,Japan,China quake,its not normal.But the nothing continues.Solar flairs.The earth gets warmer it makes cooling steam.All normal cycles.
The real concern I have is"Can an ice age earth produce as much breathable air as we burn in fossil fuel.
 The answer is No.Not even close to enough.In time people will see that.

If America owes blacks reparations for slavery, then the blacks owe whites reparations for the hundreds of thousands that died in our Civil war for their freedom.

The Philippines is setting a great example in gradually trying to make up for a great injustice. There's still a lot of work to do in that country, but at least something is being done.

Sadly, America still owes reparations to a lot of its own people. Some may never be repaid.

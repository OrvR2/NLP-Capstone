Kudos to the old guy, i'd like to know his secret. But lay of Phil! I'm sure he's not the one pressing the ads here. Try to get that through your brute skulls.
While i dont like the way the ads are pushed either, Truthloader is nonetheless an awesome channel. Anyway, it would be worse if the ad was at the beginning of an ITN video. Instead it's at the end. So why dont you just go to Youtube home﻿ page or close the window? Or search another video if you dont like it?

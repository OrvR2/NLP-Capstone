My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims, their families and loved ones. Unfortunately we, society as a whole, learn the hard way. It wasn't enough to hear about other nightclub fires like The Station Nightclub (The Great White-tragedy) in Rhode Island in 2002/2003? Or at Lame Horse nightclub in Russia/2009. Or in China and Argentina. It doesn't matter what part of the world. It happened and it can happen again. I hope we'll learn it this time around and honor all the lives lost.

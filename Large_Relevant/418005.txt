when will people learn that setting off fireworks indoors is a bad idea? the 2 other major nightclub fires(in US+RU) that also killed 100+ people each were also caused by fireworks.... is anyone seeing a pattern here? i mean it even has the name FIRE in it, FIRE-WORKS..... who would let it off in a nightclub full of people? you might as well throw a grenade in﻿ there

Luke 13:6-9
Jesus said: “A man planted a fig tree in his garden & came again & again to see if there was any fruit on it, but he was always disappointed. Finally, he said to his gardener, I’ve waited three years & there hasn’t been a single fig! Cut it down. It’s just taking up space in the garden. The﻿ gardener answered, Sir, give it one more chance. Leave it another year & I’ll give it special attention & plenty of fertilizer. If we get figs next year, fine. If not, then you can cut it down”

They were breaking the wall to release some of﻿ the smoke, because the fire fighters couldn't see a thing inside and couldn't breath well, even with gas masks

Absolutely futile; It was all over long before they ever took a sledgehammer to the first block. Look﻿ at the video for The Station Nightclub fire. From the point of ignition, the first deaths occurred in about two minutes. Within 6 minutes, anybody who wasn't outside was dead from smoke inhalation or burns. Most frightening video I've ever seen. It happens with amazing speed....

This happened 9 years ago in Argentina (December, 2004). Almost 200 people killed due to fireworks in﻿ a night club called Cromañon.

Lady Gaga prays for Brazil club fire victims after Little Monster loses life




Grief ... Lady Gaga prays for the victims of Brazil club fire






By TIM NIXON	



Published: 
28th
January 2013





 





















LADY Gaga has shown her grief for the victims of a nightclub fire in Brazil by 
posting a photo of herself praying. 


The pop star was so moved by the tragedy that claimed at least 231 lives that 
she shared this image of herself with her followers. 


The move came after the Born This Way singer learned one of her fans died in 
the blaze in Santa Maria. 


The 26-year-old also reached out to the families and loved ones of the 
victims, writing: “My heart is with you Brazil. 


“Sending my prayers to the families and friends who lost loved ones in the 
fire in Brazil. I’m thinking of you today during this tragedy.”


The chart titan – who affectionately refers to her followers as Little 
Monsters – also retweeted the message that alerted her to her fan’s demise. 


It read: “A Little Monster died in a tragedy here in Brazil! His name is Luiz 
Felipe! Mother Monster Pray for him! @ladygaga #PrayForSantaMaria +181.”


She encouraged her fans across the globe to “pray for Santa Maria”. 


Gaga appears to have posed for the snap shortly after waking up. 


She’s pictured perched on the side of her bed, minus make-up, and sporting 
un-brushed hair. 


The fire tore through the Kiss club in the early hours of Sunday morning. It 
is thought most victims were killed by suffocation or during the stampede 
when clubbers tried to escape.

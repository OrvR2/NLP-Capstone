Bangladesh factory that burned had locked exit, worker allegesCBC – Sun, Jan 27, 2013

Seven women are dead after fire swept through a garment factory in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, and investigators are looking into allegations that the building's emergency exit was locked.
The fire at the Smart Export Garment Ltd. factory broke out Saturday, two months after 112 workers were killed by a fire at another garment factory near Dhaka. The gates of that factory were locked.
Government official Jahangir Kabir Nanak said an investigation has been ordered into the cause of the fire.
Altaf Hossain, father of a garment worker killed in the latest fire, has filed a police case against three directors of the factory, accusing them of negligence involving the fire, Dhaka Metropolitan Police Sub-inspector Shamsul Hoque told The Associated Press on Sunday.
He said police had begun an investigation.
Doctors said most of the victims died from asphyxiation.
"When I tried to escape through the emergency exit I found the gate locked," Raushan Ara, a worker at the factory, was quoted as saying by Dhaka's Prothom Alo newspaper.
The newspaper said at least 50 people were injured in a stampede triggered by the fire. Six were hospitalized, while others received first aid treatment on their own.
Some of the injured jumped out of the windows of the two-storey factory, survivors said.
Dhaka Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Monzurul Kabir said the bodies of seven women were recovered from the top floor of the factoryt. He said the factory was making pants and shirts, but could not provide further details.
Fire official Abdul Halim said it took firefighters about two hours to bring the blaze under control.
Volunteers joined firefighters in battling the fire as a large crowd gathered outside the factory awaiting word on the fate of relatives. Family members were seen crying near the body of a female worker named Josna, who was 16.
About 250 workers were working at the time of the fire, newspapers said.
It was not immediately known if the factory produced garments for any international companies. The owner was not available for comment, and the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association said the factory was not a member so it had no details.
Earlier this month, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. alerted its global suppliers that it will immediately drop them if they subcontract their work to factories that haven't been authorized by the discounter.
The stricter contracting rule, along with other changes to its policy, come amid increasing calls for better safety oversight after the deadly fire in late November at a factory owned by Tazreen Fashions Ltd. that supplied clothing to Wal-Mart and other retailers. Wal-Mart has said the factory wasn't authorized to make its clothes.
Wal-Mart ranks second behind Swedish fast fashion retailer H&M in the number of clothing orders it places in Bangladesh.
Fires have led to more than 600 deaths of garment workers in Bangladesh since 2005, according to research by the advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.

The Bangladesh government will never do anything about this terrible type of tragedy; heck, there's money to be made. And right there in the very Capital City, there's no inspections, fines or imprisonments. They'll just bring in another hundred young girls from villages and continue to 'work them to death', ghastly places; actually its the government people not the places that are bad..

locking exits is a common practice in sweat shops.  first clue that these women were pretty much slaves.  is the owner going to get punished by the full force of the law??...only if he CAN'T pay off the right people.

Wally-Mart believes in slave labour. That is how they do business. They enjoy making the people in third world countries even feel lower then they already are. That is why I never shop at Wally-Mart. Nothing but junk there and the food they sell is even worse then what you find in a dumpster.

As long as human lives are considered cheaper than building improvements, there will continue to be more deaths...
The only reason to lock emergency exits is to control people's movements...
They 'could' put alarmed emergency doors in place to control that but sadly, that would cut into their profits.

Women's lives don't count in Bangladesh. That these factories have locked doors, and no safety measures is business as usual. Therefore...no-one should go to work in these death traps until safety matters are dealt with. Boycott these factories until they get it right.

what really hurts is there is seven families with no mothers, daughters, wives now and nobody gives a dam as long as their producing cheap goods for the west to consume.
Lock the owners of the factory set it on fire and forget about them in just the same way they will forget about these families.

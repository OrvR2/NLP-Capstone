Its funny because for 10 years Liberals have been blaming violence on violent movies and video games but as soon as their own excuses are used against them it becomes a crazy nutty idea.ďťż Well Libtards.....that's the plan. Use your stupidity against you so you can experience the stupidity that you extrude without you knowing.

Guns can't doďťż anything on their own, except sit and collect dust. They have to be forced to do just about anything beyond that.

the only way they're taking away my video games is from my cold dead fingers... which shouldn't be much of a problem since they have gunsďťż and what not. It actually offends me that video games have been brought up so much in this gun debate. What a bunch of god damn fools.

Of course this trash is on MSNBC.ďťż He said nothing wrong. I believe their is no connection between video games and violence unless the person has a mental condition, even then its debatable.He said both are protected by the 1st and 2nd amendment. He didn't flat out say let's ban video games or change something about them. This title is implying way to much. Fuck you.

It's not what was said. It's the principle. You can say anything is a problem. The issue is they are using video games as a focus. Why not look at the economy, congress, poverty, walmart, political injustice,ďťż the drinking water, meds, literature , entertainment all alike?

Yeah, that happens. But how often? I mean there will always be someone that has some mental problems and do harm the society, that's inevitable, but guns, in fact, helped these guys to do what wanted. The senator, or the society cannot simply push the responsibility to the the video games.ďťż Guns do harm.

Their logical train is so completely off the tracks. People killed each other long before any of these existed: Guns, video games, rap music, violent movies, etc. People want to put the blame everywhere but where it belongs.
On People. Mental health is the most ignored and underreported issue in America, and people who admit toďťż it are ostracized and vilified, so why would anyone admit to it and seek help? It MUST change, and it is the ONLY thing that will make a difference.

Wanna do away with evil video games? Doďťż away with the ACLU. This organization does more evil than good. All it does is cater to atheist, homos and evil in every form. It claims to stand for freedom of speech and expression.. But god forbid some christian wants to excercise his freedom, anything that prevents the societal decay.. And all hell breaks loose with the ACLU. It needs to be shut down. We dont have a gun problem in this country.

Blame the video games not the real actual thing. How can gun people think banning video games is good.

Secondly, this is ain't gonna stop anything, people will do what they want to do and government with their false moral superiority is not gonna fucking stop anyone from exercising their freedom.

He's not a communist. Listen to what he actually said! FORGET THE DAMN FALSE TITLE TO THE VIDEO! The uploader is trying to manipulate you with that deceptive title, Nischal!
The senator said we have to follow the US Constitution, so we can't do much about guns OR video games.
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A COMMUNIST?!!!!
THINK FREELY and LOGICALLY! It's goodďťż for you (and the rest of us)!

You may be eighteen but you obviously didn't pass highschool, so you are no smarter than the people you sayďťż are so malleable, oh sorry you probably don't know what that means. A better word to use around people like you would be easily manipulated, by these video games, in fact, the eight year olds you are saying are so easily manipulated by media re probably smarter than YOU are.

I've played video games for as long as I canďťż remember, and I can safely say that the majority of them were violent in some way, but you don't see my name on any criminal record, I had no discipline problems in high school, and I have A's and B's in college. So I don't think that vid games are really an issue here.

You're retarded. 9/11 happened because of Terrorists, who, yes, armedďťż with box-cutters (though no one gave a shit about a cut from a box-cutter) claiming the Plane was SET WITH EXPLOSIVES *DING DING DING*...yep, that's what the people on the plane were afraid of and thinking they were hostages for ransom instead of cargo for the terrorists' death ride, that's why most failed to act before the end.

He never said video games kill people. You've been manipulated by the power of leftist suggestion, fed to you by the liberal uploader via the video's false title. Iďťż guess you're susceptible to that kind of thing.

He didn't say dangerous. He said video games are a bigger problem than guns. He didn't really elaborate any further and then the video ends a few seconds after that.
You're hallucinating about 20 additional words of speculation based on a single sentence combined with theďťż misleading power of suggestion introduced by the misleading video title.

Alright, your words carry some truth, but you're oversimplifying the matter. He is comparing video games to guns, and claiming that they are a bigger problem. In what ways, given the context of theďťż situation, which I'm sure you know if you watch the news, would guns be comparable to video games? Please, reply with as many alternative comparisons that would contradict our "speculation" as you can think of/fit in the text box.

His saying video games are a bigger problem than guns doesn't necessarily mean he believes video games are comparable to guns(which is also more speculation on what did he mean?) He might mean that more people are impacted negatively in the US by video games than real guns(now I'm speculating)
I think it's unhealthy for kids to waste many hours playing & focusing on video games every day(even just a few hours every day). Moderation would be key, but kids aren'tďťż always good with that.TextBoxFull

The main point is this Republican Senator is not a threat to the right to own aďťż gun or a video game, because the US Constitution doesn't permit it, according to the Republican Senator himself.
But what does President Obama think of the 1st and 2nd Amendments? My opinion? Not much.

When public figures speak publicly with little explanation as to what the he /she may mean, the public must speculate until further clarification is given. How else would you form an opinion about these events? Opinion is whatďťż the US government is all about. And since we must speculate, and since he brought up video games while speaking about guns, there is not many other alternative meanings to what he was saying. The relation between playing vid games and health is somewhat irrelevant.

So much stupid in one sentence, quick little history lesson inďťż Germany 1933 some people were convinced of the same thing....then the Holocaust happened.
It is the same every time

Full Hitler quote ""Secular schools can never be tolerated because such schools have no religious instruction, and a general moral instruction without a religious foundation is built on air; consequently, all character training and religion must be derived from faith ...we need believing people.

On a more serious note however the only people that play video games and do something of that nature were mentally and emotionally compromised already and and they would more than just likely do what they're doing even if they don't play videogames.ďťż

No. Butďťż Obama supports a strict ban on ordinary hand guns. He's hostile to the Bill of Rights, including a woman's right toďťż choose a handgun for protection from male stalkers & weirdos. Obama believes women shouldn't be allowed to own hand guns.

Saying guns kill people is also foolish, that's likeďťż saying pencils misspell words, not people. If the Koreans didn't have semi auto rifles during the LA riots, they would have easily been killed and pillaged far more than what actually happened.
And yes, the UK is talking about banning sharp kitchen knives because violent crime rose far higher after guns were banned.

Religion is just another tool. I'll repeat.
Don't blame the tool, blame the person using the tool. Or perhaps misusing would be aďťż better word.

George bush should be trialled and put in prison or even get the death penalty for his killing of thousands of innocent civilians. Our leaders should be held accountable for there war crimes. Just because they were president doesn't give them privileges to kill innocent civilians. Congressmen and presidents have killed much more people than those in prisonďťż who are doing life for the killing of an innocent individual along with those who were present while the murder took place and didn't try to

Just so you know Naruto, Obama has killed 3 times as many innocent civilians as Bush. Obama uses drones to kill while Bush used people because of theďťż lack of accuracy of drones. Obama doesnt care about the middle east and the Muslims who will end up hating us because he can shift responsibility on Bush for 'starting' the war. Obama has started more wars than Bush and Obama has troops still in Iraq despite the medias obvious butt kissing and denial that we are still there. All of this in ONE term

Actually, it's the damage to the human body caused by those bullets that kills people. In war, it's often infections that deliver the final blows toďťż those who have been shot, so bacteria also kills people.

Hammers and steak knives help kill moreďťż people in America than guns in America. Bare FISTS/HANDS also kill more people in America.

tell me, if you could avoid the death of some people by doing something, would you do it? or would you just give theďťż excuse that other things cause more deaths... but those things that cause more deaths can't be really avoided, but gun deaths, you could.

Are you psycho?!!!
The Republican Senator said you can't do much about about video games because of the 1st Amendment and you can't do much about guns becauseďťż of the 2nd Amendment...
Where in the HELL do you see this Senator supporting a totalitarian state after that statement? HUH?!!!! pSychoSight fails fabulously.
Unfortunately, Obama doesn't share this Republican senator's respect for the Constitution.
Obama's the statist to worry about.

We need guns for protection against:
rapists, terrorists, tyrants, murderers, kidnappers, gay-bashers, lynch mob/kkk-types, robbers, stalkers, mass-shooters, violent flash mobs, rioters, extreme protestors, drug cartels and gang members...
The reason there are 300ďťż million guns here (actually, more than 300 million) is because guns have been legal and available in America for over 240 years and our population is about 300 million.
Are we supposed to share a few thousand guns amongst ourselves?

Amend 2nd Amendment? Very unlikely.
Extreme protestors throw objects at police, light mom & pop grocery stores on fire, smash windows, flip innocent civilians' cars & light them on fire. Extreme protestors were common in the EARLY 2000s. They trashed Seattle, way back in early 2000.
You challenged 2 of my examples. That leaves rapists, racists, terrorists, murderers, kidnappers,ďťż gay-bashers, robbers, stalkers, mass-shooters, violent flash mobs, rioters, extreme protestors, drug cartels & gangs

I totally agree with your position, Im just playing devil's advocate right now. There is a difference between guns killing someone and cars killing someone. Mostďťż of the time death by cars are from accidents and in addition cars were created to improve transportation. Death by a gun is usually intented and guns were invented mostly for killing/hunting. Your statement isn't a very good example.

He's said "the 1st Amendment limits what we can do about video games, the 2nd Amendment limits what we can do about guns". Why?

Govts registered guns, confiscated them and then murdered 250 Million stupid, helpless citizens in just the last 100ďťż years. THAT is why guns are second only to speech!

Guy has probably never played a video gameďťż in his life, just looking for something to blame. How about we blame the parents of these idiot kids shooting schools up, they are the ones to blame, not a game.

Since guns don'tďťż people and people kill people, we need to thus remove guns from people so people are not killed more rapidly.
The gun love crowd is irrational. Gun control is the answer. Always has been. But, the NRA has massive funding to prevent control.

Let's get rid of all types of vehicles, rocks, shovels, axes, knives, wood, water (drowning),any combustible fuels bio or non, electricity, no more surgeries (over 197,000 surgery related deathsďťż a year as opposed to 12,000 gun related deaths a year),pens, pencils, fists, feet, cloth, ban and control everything because it all kills people whether rapid or not. More people died at the Battle of Cannae in 1 day (est. 80,000 Romans and Carthaginians), without guns. You're irrational and illogical.

There are flaws with your argument. Guns were invented for killing people. Apart from hunting, guns have literally no other use. All the things you listed have other uses. Whilstďťż your surgery numbers may be true (I'm not going to check), it is a definite fact that they save more lives than they end and no surgeon has ever gone into a hospital with the intent to kill their patient (other than about 5 ever)

Iďťż have a question. As someone who doesn't live in the US, I have never understood why the 2nd amendment (or any of your constitution etc.) is considered infallible. Also, of course I care about the people killed, or I wouldn't be saying that the access to the tools used to kill those people needs to be at least reconsidered.

There are many examples how guns have saved livesďťż Home invasions etc.The largest ever school killing took place in Michigan in the 1940's with TNT.What flaws are there?Guns are made out of different materials combined. Should we ban these materials? Your argument is flawed (with respect).If America got rid of its Nuclear weapons,would the rest of the world?No.That's why we have them as well. Its fear of retaliation.When people shoot up places people with guns are called.I suggest everyone carry.

I suppose that since the US already has so many guns, it would be impossible to restrict them in any meaningful way at this point, but don't you agree that it would be better if there were literallyďťż no guns instead of everybody only kept peaceable by each others constant fear of one another? Or to use your nuclear weapons analogy, which is better, peace through diplomacy or peace through M.A.D.?

It's not really a need. We need food and water. We don't need weapons. Kitchen knives are weapons. What are they going to do? Ban kitchen knives? Cars are weapons too. Maybe they'll ban cars? The second amendment is there not so that we can have guns to hunt. It isďťż there so that when a government becomes tyrannical, we, the people have a mean to defend against the corrupted regime. Now, if our government is not corrupted, they should have no fear. It's a right, not a need.

Guns or video games don't kill people. People kill people. How many of us play shooters and aren't murderers? 85 to 100 million gun owners in this country aren't murdering people everyday. It comes down to personal responsibility.ďťż Taking away video games or guns of any type won't stop murder. And last time I checked murder was against the law. Yet people still do it. There is no earthly Utopia and there never will be. Leave us alone and stop interfering in our lives.

This guy is just looking for a scapegoat, guns and games dont kill peopl because one guns and games are objects, two gamesďťż only provide an entertainment or waste of time, and 3 people kill people by using guns. maybe we should look at the fact that these people that have been killing others in the recent events have had a mental break down, or major problems with social life and dont know how to handle it properly and no one is helping them.

Funfact: Most murderers and school shooters are not inspired by games at all! The majority of murderers who were inspired to kill are inspired by writing, especiallyďťż THEIR OWN. Followed by TV, followed by music, followed by comics, and near the end, video games.
Most murderers aren't inspired by video games. Video games do not promote people to kill people, or force people not to kill people. It's all personal choice. Blame the people, not the form of media they were inspired from.

I've been playing video games since I was young, haven't gone berserk and killed a bunch of people yet. I also have no urge to own a gun. And if that were to happen, I wouldn't be able to kill as many people if I didn't have access to an assault rifle. I'd also be more limited if I didn'tďťż have access to any firearms!
Video games entertain, stimulate, and help with hand/eye coordination. Guns have one function only, to kill. Why do we defend instruments who's only function is to end life?

He correctly reasons that guns never add security, they remove security.
Think: Someone living under a weapon ban wants you harm. You two exchange punches, police arrestďťż him.
Someone living in the US wants you harm. You go for your gun because you're scared. Wait, he's already drawn his gun and he kills you.
How's the self-defense think working then?

I can't even wrap my mind around the bullshit coming out of his mouth. "Games are moreďťż dangerous than guns"? I'm sure he says that because millions of kids are getting in their hover tanks and gunning down people in the street.

Shooting games help me relieveďťż stress. I just imagine all my problems are the people I'm shooting in the game. This way, I'll never even think about doing it in real life.

Blog Posts by Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsAuthorities crack down on copycat threats after NewtownBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Wed, Dec 19, 2012Tweet0

Authorities are cracking down on a spate of threats against schools following Friday's attack at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults before killing himself.
In Indiana, police have responded to threats against three separate schools, making arrests in each case. They included a Bloomington South High School student who allegedly threatened a "copycat" school shooting; police removed six guns from his home, The AP reported. Two other teens, one in California, the other in Tennessee, who posted online that they would like to commit similar shootings were promptly arrested,  CNN reported. Another teen in Tennessee was arrested after making phone calls to a local elementary school with a bomb threat.
Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance said last week than anyone making threats would be investigated and prosecuted.
It's common for threats against schools to spike after a much-publicized shooting, and research has suggested there may be a link between how much attention an incident gets in the media and how many copycat threats follow.
In the 50 days after the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, more than 350 threats were reported at Pennsylvania schools, skyrocketing from the one or two threats reported in the same period a year earlier. A study, published in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine in 1999, determined that the publicity Columbine received led to a spike in bomb and other threats on schools. A similar shooting a year earlier in Jonesboro, Ark., received a fraction of the media attention that Columbine did, and attracted many fewer copycat threats in the days following.

Gun deaths set to outstrip car fatalities for first time in 2015By Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Wed, Dec 19, 2012Tweet0

Deaths from firearms are set to outstrip car fatalities for the first time, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and reported by Bloomberg News.
The CDC estimates that auto-related deaths--long on the decline as more motorists wear seat-belts and face harsher penalties for drunk driving--will fall to 32,000 in 2015. Deaths from firearms, which include suicides and accidents, are estimated to rise to 33,000 over the same period.
Every day, 85 Americans are shot dead, about 53 of them in suicides. This figure is still lower than 1993's peak in gun deaths (37,666), but has risen significantly since firearm deaths reached a low  in 2000 (28,393). The data goes back to 1979.
Meanwhile, USA Today, which looked at FBI figures, reports that 774 people were killed between 2006 and 2010 by a mass killer, defined as a person who kills four or more people in one incident. The figures show that mass killers strike on average once every two weeks. A third of the 156 mass killings

6th-grader brings gun to school to protect against ‘Connecticut-style’ attackBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Dec 18, 2012Tweet0
A sixth-grader at West Kearns Elementary School near Salt Lake City, Utah, brought a gun to school on Monday, saying he wanted to protect himself and his friends after Friday's shooting in Newtown, Conn.
He "continues to assert that he brought the weapon to protect himself and his friends from a 'Connecticut-style [shooting],'" Granite School District spokesman Ben Horsley said.
Two of the 11-year-old's classmates told their teacher on Monday afternoon that the student had a gun. The teacher immediately "apprehended" the student and contacted the authorities, Horsley said. The boy is being charged with one count of possession of a firearm on school property and three counts of aggravated assault, for allegedly threatening some of his classmates.
He will be charged in the juvenile system and eventually will be transferred to another school.
Survivalists worry ‘preppers’ will be scapegoated for Newtown shootingBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Dec 18, 2012Tweet0
Sunday's New York Post coverEver since a relative of Newtown, Conn., shooter Adam Lanza suggested that his mother, Nancy Lanza, was a "survivalist" who stockpiled food and weapons, "preppers" have gone online to express concern that they may become targets of unwelcome attention.
"She prepared for the worst," Nancy Lanza's sister-in-law, Marsha Lanza, told reporters last weekend. "Last time we visited her in person, we talked about prepping—are you ready for what could happen down the line, when the economy collapses?"
Preppers, also known as survivalists, have been popularized by the National Geographic reality show "Doomsday Preppers." They range from people who believe the world will end soon to those who want to be better prepared in case a natural disaster hits.
Some preppers pursue "shelter in place" strategies, turning their homes into fortresses and stockpiling food, while others plan to flee their homes when the time comes and survive in the wilderness. Many swap tips and stories on online message boards, where discussions about Nancy Lanza and the possible blowback on preppers from her apparent connection to the community sparked debate over the weekend.
Adam Lanza, 20, is believed to have shot his mother while she slept before driving to a nearby elementary school and killing six adults and 20 children. People who knew Nancy Lanza, 52, and her son have told reporters that she took Adam to shooting ranges and legally owned five guns. It's suspected that three of the guns recovered at the scene of the crime belonged to his mother. On Sunday, the New York Post ran a cover story that seemed to lay blame for the shooting at her feet, titled "Gun-obsessed mom taught murderer son to shoot: Trained to Kill."
One leading prepper, Daisy Luther, was outraged by the cover, and wrote on her blog the Organic Prepper that the media is using the shootings to "demonize" preppers and that the tactic may be a form of "psychological warfare."
"I don’t know why Adam Lanza went on a rampage and killed 26 people last week. But I do know that it wasn’t because his mother was a homeschooling prepper who stored up food and taught him to fire a gun at a paper target," she wrote.

Gun sales spike: Virginia, Colorado record highest background check volume in yearsBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Dec 18, 2012Tweet0

The talk of new gun control measures that has followed Friday's mass shooting in a Newtown, Conn., elementary school has gun buyers rushing to the nearest store and picking up new weapons, according to gun store owners and state police background check information.
On Saturday, Virginia state police fielded 4,166 requests for background checks, a 42 percent increase from the same Saturday last year and the highest number of transactions received in a single day since the program was implemented in 1989. Sunday's 1,828 background checks in Virginia represented a 43 percent increase from a year ago. Colorado also set a one-day record for background checks on Saturday with 4,200, the highest number since the program began in 1999.
Paul Decker, the owner of Hunters' Heaven in Hayes, Va., said he saw a big spike in sales over the weekend, with many customers buying the AR type of rifle allegedly used in the Newtown shooting. Gun control advocates want AR and other semi-automatic rifles banned, returning to the Bill Clinton-era policy that was the law of the land from 1994 to 2004. Also flying off the shelves were high-capacity magazines and ammunition, over fears Congress could vote to limit them.
"The people that would normally buy a box [of ammo] are buying four or five boxes," Decker said.

Will Obama use executive action on guns?By Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Dec 18, 2012Tweet0
Two AR-15 rifles in a gun store in Colorado (Getty Images)Proponents of stricter gun control measures are pressuring President Barack Obama to sidestep Congress and act now to tighten the nation's controls on firearms.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the nation's leading proponents of stricter gun control, held a press conference on Monday, flanked by victims of gun violence and their families, to urge Obama to act.
"There are steps that the president can take on his own, right now, to address gun violence," Bloomberg said on Monday.
It's true that Obama, no longer worried about re-election, could take some action on guns without Congress, including pushing for more oversight of sellers and more thorough background checks for buyers. Obama hinted in a Sunday night prayer vigil with mourners in Newtown, Conn., that inaction will not be an option.
"I'll use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this, because what choice do we have?" he said.
In fact, after the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson in 2011, Obama ordered the Justice Department to examine how the FBI's background check system, which is used in most gun sales to ensure felons or mentally ill people are not buying weapons, has more up-to-date information. Since then, the Justice Department has slightly beefed up the database by automatically adding federal crime information instead of waiting for prosecutors to manually input it.
But there are still huge holes in the database, including crucial information from other federal and state agencies about whether someone is mentally ill. After the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, Congress called on these other agencies, including the Social Security Administration, to share this information. (The Virginia Tech shooter had been declared mentally ill by a state judge, but that information wasn't in the FBI database.) So far that hasn't happened, according to a New York Times report. (In the Newtown case, it's unclear whether a better FBI database would have helped, because the weapons used were reportedly registered to the shooter's mother.)
Bloomberg said Monday that with a "stroke of his pen," Obama could compel other agencies to share this information, bolstering the background checks that most gun buyers go through before obtaining weapons.

Sandy Hook survivors struggle to pick up the piecesBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Sat, Dec 15, 2012Tweet0

NEWTOWN, Conn.--As residents here learned the names Saturday of the 20 children and six adults killed at Sandy Hook School in one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history, kids and their parents began a long mourning process.
Roxanne Mader, the mother of 7-year old Bianca, a student at Sandy Hook, said two of her daughter's friends are among the dead, as well as her principal, Dawn Hochsprung, whom Bianca loved.
"I cried a lot," Bianca said quietly, after visiting a small memorial of flowers and candles set up across the street from the school. "I miss my principal. She said, keep on working, don't give up."
Hochsprung reportedly tried to stop the shooting, heroically lunging at the gunman before he shot her and continued on his rampage.
Mader said her daughter has not been shielded from Friday's events.
"They told them to keep their eyes closed (when evacuating the building) and she did, but some of the kids didn't and then as they walked they already shared the information with each other, unfortunately," Mader said.
Steven Reps, a parent of a first grader at Sandy Hook who was volunteering in the classroom when the shooting began, said he is still struggling to explain what happened to his daughter. Reps told the class on Friday morning that a wild animal was in the school, after the children began to ask why they had to hide in the classroom for so long, listening to gunfire. "One said, 'Maybe it's a wild animal,' and I said, 'Yeah, I think it's a fox,'" Reps said. On Saturday, he explained to his daughter that a person, not an animal, was responsible for the shooting, and that he was now dead and could no longer hurt anyone. They're still waiting to tell her about her schoolmates who have died. "We're going to let this sink in for a while," he said.
Kathy Murdy, a Pre-K teacher in Newtown, traveled to the media-inundated Treadwell Park on top of a hill in town because she heard officials would be releasing the names of the dead. A reporter showed her the list, and she spotted the name of one of her former students, six-year-old Catherine Hubbard. "These are our babies," Murdy said.

Newtown residents hold prayer vigil after horrific mass shootingBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Fri, Dec 14, 2012Tweet0

NEWTOWN, Conn.--"Oh God," one man said as he stared at a row of 26 glowing candles in front of St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church at a Friday night prayer vigil. "Twenty kids."
That unbelievable, devastating fact is still ripping through this small, affluent Connecticut town, where a gunman entered a local elementary school on Friday morning and shot and killed 26 people, most of them children under the age of 10, before turning the gun on himself. According to the Hartford Courant, an entire kindergarten class at Sandy Hook School is unaccounted for, but the police have not yet confirmed that fact, nor are they yet releasing the names of the victims. The shooting is the second worst in U.S. history, after the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007.
At a Friday night prayer vigil, hundreds of residents poured outside the doors of St. Rose's Catholic Church, unable to fit into the packed building full of people mourning the young victims. The scene was eerily quiet, except for the flash of news cameras. Some people hugged each other, weeping, while others quietly recited the rosary in unison.

Many residents of the town, where well-maintained clapboard homes with white picket fences dot the hilly landscape, are still struggling to come to grips with how such a horrific mass shooting could happen anywhere, much less in their sleepy town.
"If it happened here it could happen anywhere," said Danielle Collins, who attended the vigil. "It's shocking."

At least three are  injured and multiple people dead after a shooting in a Connecticut elementary school on Friday morning, according to local news reports. At least one child is dead, according to the Hartford Courant. ABC News reported, without naming a source, that as many as a dozen people, including children, have died in the attack. Connecticut state police wouldn't confirm that number to Yahoo News, saying they won't comment until a 1 p.m. ET press conference.
State police entered the elementary school after a shooting was reported there, spokesman Lt. Paul Vance told Yahoo News. Vance said the scene is still "active" and that "every available on- and off-duty officer in the vicinity" is responding to the scene.
President Barack Obama was informed of the shooting at 10:30 am by Homeland Security adviser John Brennan, White House press secretary Jay Carney said. The FBI is supporting state and local response to the shooting and Obama will get regular updates, Carney said.

Bobby Jindal: Birth control should be over the counterBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Dec 14, 2012Tweet0

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican and a potential 2016 presidential candidate, has a solution for the GOP's birth control problem: Make it over the counter.
"The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists announced its support last month for selling oral contraceptives over the counter without a prescription in the United States," Jindal writes in Friday's Wall Street Journal opinion section. "I agree with this opinion, which if embraced by the federal government would take contraception out of the political arena." Jindal also writes that prescription birth control drives up costs with unnecessary doctors' visits.
"Democrats have wrongly accused Republicans of being against birth control and against allowing people to use it. That's hogwash," Jindal wrote. "But Republicans do want to protect those who have religious beliefs that are opposed to contraception."
Democrats used Republicans' objections to the mandatory birth control coverage portion of Obama's health care

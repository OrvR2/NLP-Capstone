5daysagoPolice: Brazil nightclub fire kills at least 233A fire broke out early Sunday morning at a night club in Santa Maria, in southern Brazil, killing revelers — many of them students. NBC's Mike Taibbi reports. By Jeff Black, Staff Writer, NBC NewsUpdated at 1:23 a.m. ET: At least 233 people were killed after a band’s fireworks show sparked a rapidly moving fire in a packed nightclub in southern Brazil and fleeing patrons were unable to find their way out, local police said.Follow @NBCNewsWorld
 The bodies removed from the Kiss nightclub in the southern city of Santa Maria were taken to the Municipal Sports Center gymnasium for identification, police said.Major Gerson da Rosa Ferreira, who led rescue efforts at the scene for the military police, told Reuters that the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled. Police Maj. Cleberson Braida Bastianello told the Associated Press by telephone that the toll had risen to 233 with the death of a hospitalized victim.

Officials earlier counted 232 bodies that had been brought to the gymnasium in Santa Maria.In addition to the number of deaths, more  than 100 people were injured, police said, and most remain hospitalized. Police officials had reported earlier in the day that 245 people were  killed. The  death toll could still rise, police said later, from the  people who are  injured.Fire brigade colonel Guido Pedroso de Melo told O Globo newspaper that rescuers had difficulty entering the premises because of "a barrier of bodies" at  the entrance to the club.Television footage monitored by Reuters overnight showed people crying outside the club as shirtless firefighters used sledge hammers and axes to knock down an exterior wall to open up an exit. Agencia RBS via APPeople help a man injured in a nightclub fire in Santa Maria city, Brazil, on Sunday.Rodrigo Moura, who the newspaper Diario de Santa Maria identified as a security guard at the club, said it was at its capacity of between 1,000 and 2,000 people and patrons were pushing and shoving to escape, the AP reported. Police estimated the crowd at some 900 revelers.Fire officials said at least one exit was locked and that club bouncers, who at  first thought those fleeing were trying to skip out on bar tabs, initially  blocked patrons from leaving, Reuters reported.The club's management said in a statement it would help authorities with their investigation, Reuters reported.One of the club's owners has surrendered to police for questioning, GloboNews TV reported. "It was really fast. There was a lot of smoke, really dark smoke," survivor Aline Santos Silva, 29, told Globonews TV. "We were only able to get out quickly because we were in a VIP area close to the door." President Dilma Rousseff cut short a visit to Chile and visited families of the victims at the Municipal Sports Center, where relatives were gathering to identify the bodies. She met with relatives of the injured at Hospital de Caridade de Santa Maria.Rousseff declared a national three-day mourning period for victims of the fire. “Sad Sunday!” Tarso Genro, the governor of Rio Grande do Sul state where the club is located, tweeted. “We are taking all of the possible and appropriate actions,” the tweet read, according to a rough translation by NBC News. “I will be in Santa Maria later this morning.”The precise cause of the fire was still under investigation, authorities said. But Luiza Sousa, a civil police official in Santa Maria, told Reuters that the blaze started when someone with the band ignited what was described as a flare, which then set fire to the ceiling. The fire spread "in seconds," Sousa said. The tragedy in Brazil recalled other nightclub disaster. A fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in 2003 killed 100 people after pyrotechnics used on stage by the rock band Great White set ablaze foam used for soundproofing on the walls. A Buenos Aires nightclub blaze in 2004 killed nearly 200 people. Reuters noted that Brazil's safety standards and emergency response capabilities are under particular scrutiny as the country prepares to host the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Brazilian state’s Health secretary, Ciro Simoni, told the news service that emergency medical supplies from all over the state were being sent to the scene. Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore related topics: brazil, fire, nightclub, featured

unwashed brainBrazil has come a long way. They have cities that are super high tech & then cities that are,...well...left behind. I'm sure they will make the nessecary safety adjustments. Right now we need to let them morn. I remember similar incident in a long Island club in the 90's. You just got to always observe when you go to a Public place.

Just like Think Wise, I am also an American living inBrazil.  My first impression of Brazilwas the lack of any perceivable regulation.  What little regulation exists are eitherignored or circumvented by corruption.   I built a house without any requirement for abuilding permit.  No one inspected myhouse and occupancy permits are not required.
I am an engineer; my world view is from an engineering perspective.  I am often saddened when I see Brazilians losetheir lives needlessly.  Many of them areelectrocuted because the electrical installations does not follow establishstandards for grounding.  The greenground wire is simply ignored.  Musiciansget electrocuted on stage; housewives are killed by simply touching the fridge.   
Official corruption is endemic.  You can buy your way without any fear oflegal prosecution.  Doctors buy theirdegrees, the wealthy buy their way into school then pay to have exam answersprovided.
This brings me to this tragedy.  A sprinkler system would have prevented this unperceivableloss of life.  But in Brazil, even if thelaw required a sprinkler system, you could operate your club simply by payingoff the city mayor.
The fire extinguisher did not work because it was usedpreviously and never recharged.  This wasnot an oversight, even if an inspection regime was in place, corruption, officialinattention and bureaucratic incompetence would have resulted in the sameshocking loss of life.
Brazil is a beautiful country with great potential, howeverwithout serious leadership; their potential for world class development willnever be realized.
Some of you are getting bent out of shape over the spelling of the country.  The official Portuguese name is REPUBLICA FEDERATIVA DO BRASIL.  Brazil is the English spelling which althoug sometimes used is not official.      2 votes#256 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 7:48 PM ESTCatzenjammerGee, it sounds like you are describing Detroit, or maybe Chicago.#256.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 8:23 PM ESTCharles Slavis"Safe" indoors fireworks simply are not safe......they continue to burn down buildings and kill people when in fact no indoors fireworks are safe.....sue the manufactures for making an unsafe product and selling it as safe.#257 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 7:48 PM ESTM.T.BarI just watched this on Law and Order, season 14 #5 called 'Blaze".

I hope they can clear this up, it appears, however, that the exits were blocked for some reason. Not to mention, the setting off of any fire or flammable materials was prohibited after the last big death scene, yes or no?#260 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 8:06 PM ESTrocketero2011the article talks about shirtless firefighters with sledgehammers, how about a bulldozer that could have broken some walls and even that had killed one in the process then could have saved many lives. while a sledgehammer would take hours to take a wall down. Just a thought, so many lives were lost in this incident that is overwhelming thinking about it.#261 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 8:07 PM ESTLaurie-2068076Sound like poor business like nightclub refused to get fire alarms without inspector.

newsgirl24So sad.
A family friend lost both her parents in the Coconut Grove club fire in Boston in 1942.
Prayers for the families.1 vote#263 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 8:12 PM ESTMoreJusticeSincere condolences to the families of the victims.
Hopefully this brings on some safety changes to the building codes. These fires happen, because the materials burn quickly and intensely. These clubs should be build with fire resistant materials, by law. It's the only way to prevent this kind of tragedy from occuring again. Locking exits should be illegal.#264 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 8:17 PM ESTAna Cristina Camargo@Think Wise - On the other hand I am a brazilian from Rio Grande do Sul living in NJ-USA and can tell that yes there are many things wrong with my country, and you are correct in many of your points. Now let me ask you this... If this was here, how many of those who survived would have a decent care at a hospital here without a private health insurance? You talk about 3rd world and corruption like USA was a completely clean and 100% safe. I can tell you something that I heard a lot around here... You don't like it there, go back to your country and deal with the BS where you belong to.2 votes#265 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 8:18 PM ESTAna Cristina CamargoI can't believe how much crap comes out of certain mouths... Talking crap about Brazil?! Yes there are too many things wrong going on there. This was a freak accident like happened here in the US too, by the way here USA is a "first world country". Now just so you people know, in Brazil you don't see crazy people walking into schools, movie theaters or, colleges with guns and killing people just for the heck of it.  Accidents happens no matter if you the country is rich or poor... This a time to pray for and support the families of the victims of the accident, not giving your stupid opinion, which for us Brazilian people, doesn't really matter.#266 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 8:29 PM ESTBarakahSuch a terrible tragedy.

brasilbIm brazilian this time the Brazil show that big and strong and that moment finally has competent people was an accident and accidents can happen anywhere in the world that God comfort the family of these dear people we are very sad!!!!#274 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 8:55 PM ESTLilarose in Bandon, ORThis was NOT an accident, it was mass murder!

Anything for $$$$$$$$$$$$4#274.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 8:58 PM ESTAna Cristina CamargoThe promoters have no idea of what the band will do on stage, this was a freak accident.#274.2 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:01 PM ESTLilarose in Bandon, ORSooooo similar to the Rhode Island 2003 nightclub fire, almost to the detail.  Pyrotechnics, most doors blocked (including doors deliberately blocked by the band itself--didn't want patrons to use the "stars" door, SMOKE OR NOT!), too many people in the building.  If I went into a nightclub, I would instantly know the pyrotechnics were no-no's safety-wise and would leave.  Whenever I go into any public building (theater, for example) I always look for the exits.  Surely someone in this city had heard of the Rhote Island fire and would have known the pytotechnics could be deadly.1 vote#275 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 8:57 PM ESTMichael-1033656If only someone would have had an AR-15, things would have turned out differently.#276 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:01 PM ESTJump to discussion page: 1 ...  8 9 10 11 12 ...  14Leave a Comment:Name: Email Address (will be verified, but never shown): You're in Easy Mode.

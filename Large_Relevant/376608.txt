Unregulated safety regulations and idiocy killed these youths. This﻿ was a terrifying incident indeed. The world mourns for the tragic incident. Let's try not to let this happen again. Playing with fire is very dangerous.

Is it odd that the club sign looks like it says "Kill" and not "Kiss"?
My﻿ heart goes out to the families and friends of the lost ones.

This happened in the U.S. when fioreworks were used indoors. Now again in Brazil. NO MORE FUCKING FIREWORKS. Fire exits, fire extinguishers and fire alarms. Kill the owner, the guards and the band member who started the panic. All perfectly﻿ played a role for a nightmare massacre. The owner, should be hung by the balls then shot. The band member, deserves the worst. The guards, remove their arms.

@Smaug84 Exactly, but even if the fire﻿ had not reached their view a cross of people running and screaming would have been enough for me to realize something was seriously wrong. I can't believe they haven't arrested the security guards! That really pisses me off!

My heart goes out to that country. Such a tragic loss. I really hope that the security guards that closed them in pays for it.﻿ If you see that many people running and screaming toward the door, your first thought is not going to be that you thought they were trying to leave without paying. That sounds like BS to me!

You're wrongly assuming that the﻿ only thing that happens at a concert is "whoring". You haven't been to many concerts have you? The majority of people go there to hang out with friends, see a show, and listen to music.

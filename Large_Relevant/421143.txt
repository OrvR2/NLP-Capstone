In the opening cinematic when theyre going down the elevator the weird voice says "accept your fate, begin anew" and then once the elevator door opens Richthofen says the same, "accept your fate, begin anew". Why would both voices say this? Like if you want spider to see﻿ this.

I am doing Richtofen EE and I think that you have to kill the zombies by the four zombie soldier symbols. Could be wrong but I know where all of them are. Another idea was to get down with all four people having who's who and come back up from it. Richtofen said something about needed to create a lot of blood shed after the liquidrator﻿ lion statue step.

maybe you have to let someone die under the dragon after they get whoswho and maybe the easter egg shows you russman dying by﻿ the new crawler because the sacrifice must be made to one of them? blood sacrifice is a pretty specific phrase tho. maybe you need to knife all the crawlers under the dragon or knife each other . like so dude can see this

There are two of﻿ the gold symbols on the dragon building that show the lions without the orbs. maybe have the two people who grabbed﻿ the orbs stand on these symbols. Also there is a symbol outside the opening room that has a zombie on it.

My﻿ theory is that since the TranZit card worked on Die Rise, then the Die Rise card should work on the next map, and the final released map's navcard will work on TranZit. Possibly if you have them all imputted, you will get something. They just keep track of your Navigation through the maps, like a passport

looks like there may be quite a bit left to this too, on Richtofin's dragon there are five sparklers going, one for each step leading up to this point
turn﻿ on power, stand on elevator symbols, stand on the symbols on the floor, shoot the orbs out of the mouth, Sliquify the orbs. There are five of them going and its not even halfway down the dragon lol

You can build a obelisk table next to the richtofen dragon. I found 2 different types of NAVcards near the PDW next to the tables. I put my tranzit one in obelisk and it accepted it. But it doesn,t do anything. At first i got a black navcard and now i have a white one. Probably try to put﻿ it in the Tranzit obelisk reader and see if it accepts?

Guys I have a Theory that Samuel was actually a Zombie and then turned Human or he is turning into a﻿ Zombie. If you listen to the new voice in the cut-scene cinematic, it says "you saw" Maybe he saw what it was like to be a Zombie?
Video on my channel of me explaining it better if your interested. Would like to hear what you guys have to say about the Theory, no pressure in checking out the video.

Hey guys, just a possible theory. When Maxis says that reincarnation is key, it might have to do with the Buddha statutes. Buddhism believes in samsara or an endless life cycle, where reincarnation is a huge part of its basic belief, unless I'm confusing it with something. It seems like you see things differently with the Who's Who perk, so maybe the Maxis side requires using the orbs and Who's Who around the Buddha statues! Thumbs up﻿ if you think it makes sense!

No, I'm not really sure where you got that or if you are﻿ just being a smartass - I am just saying that as opposed to on Tranzit where if the power is on you are doing Richtofen and if it is off you are helping Maxis. This video shows that you can potentially complete both at the same time!

What the characters do not know if there being played with, when they die or fail to do Richetofen's orders they taken back in time to try again. Samuel and Marlton both quote on this saying things like, "Wait...weren't we here﻿ before?" and "Let's go for another round".

I'm an achievement hunter as well,and I noticed something interesting that can be related to the easter egg... There is one achievement wich you need to use all perks machine and the pack-a-punch in order to get it.... But HOW ? Once we can only buy 4 perks and there are 6 acessible perks machine and 1 hidden﻿ ?

OMG I have an amazing theory: ok so if the navcard from tranzit works on die rise then the die rise will work on the next DLC and the next one will work in the next one, but the FINAL DLC pack will work with TRANZIT and remember how Richthofen was saying your precious little world will be saved soon, and he's says he's trying to help, I think that's what's gonna﻿ happen and there will be a teleported or something .. I really hope treyarch puts lots of effort into the final conclusive Easter egg :

Since Maxis is dead and Richthofen says man the rift (rift is a crack through a dimension like a portal for﻿ the dead), I think Maxis is going to put his soul into one of the characters . Also, ghosts produce electromagnetic fields, so i think that's why Richthofen says neutralize the energy fields in order to prevent Maxis' plan because Maxis is a ghost.

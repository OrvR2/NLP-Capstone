Blog Posts by Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsTwo final tracking polls split between Obama and RomneyBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Mon, Nov 5, 2012Tweet0
Two final tracking polls from Gallup and the Washington Post/ABC News were released Monday, with the former showing Mitt Romney up 1 point among likely voters and the latter favoring President Obama by 3 points.
Gallup says Romney leads Obama by 1 point among likely voters, 49 to 48 percent. The poll's margin of error is 2 percentage points, meaning the race is a statistical tie. (Three percent of likely voters told Gallup they were undecided.)
The Washington Post/ABC News tracking poll has Obama at 50 percent and Romney at 47 percent among likely voters. The poll has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points, which means a small portion of the president's lead is statistically significant. The poll also found that 55 percent of likely voters believe Obama will win the election.

Forget the war on women: The men’s vote could decide who wins in 2012By Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Sun, Nov 4, 2012Tweet0

A barrage of attention from the presidential candidates and the news media has been paid to "waitress moms," "Walmart women" and other exhibits of the female species this election, with pundits wondering whether the female gender gap, which works in the president's favor, will carry him over the top on Election Day.
But the focus might be better spent on men.
"The issue is not the women's vote, but the men's vote," Frank Newport, Gallup's editor-in-chief, told Yahoo News. The reason: Polls show male voters look much more likely to break from their 2008 voting patterns. If that happens, the men's vote could decide whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney becomes the next president.
Four years ago, Obama won 49 percent of the male vote, buoyed by historic gains with white men, who chose the Democratic candidate in the highest proportions seen since Jimmy Carter. Even so, most white men—57 percent of them—still voted for John McCain, and a majority of such voters have not backed a Democratic

New Yorkers prepared for fourth night of darknessBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Fri, Nov 2, 2012Tweet0

On Thursday, 250,000 Manhattanites living below 39th Street braced themselves for a fourth consecutive night without electricity.
Some walked miles to find open grocery stores to replenish dwindling food supplies; others ventured outside for the first time since the storm hit to reluctantly report to work without a functioning transportation system. Most store fronts were still shuttered, and if you peered into the windows of shops close to the waterfront, you could see that the storm surge had  moved around the merchandise, as if the stores had gone through a car wash.
Remarkably, no one seemed that cranky.
Ruven Gottlieb and Dulce Moche, a married couple in their 60s who live on the fourth floor of a public housing building in the Lower East Side, had been eating gefilte fish stew--the only thing in their fridge when the storm hit Monday night--for days. They'd also been living without electricity or hot water.
Both were looking forward to a hot bath when the power finally comes back on Friday or Saturday, the utility company's latest estimate. (Many New Yorkers in other boroughs have to wait even longer for electricity to be restored.)
"For me, the scariness is the halls are dark, the stairways are dark," Moche said. "I have a cane and that's scary. I don't go out unless my husband takes me down the stairs." Gottlieb had attached a small pen flashlight to his glasses to light up the dark stairwell for them both.
But there had also been some bright spots. Neighbors have helped each other out, checking in on the more elderly residents of the building. And the unexpected and unusual quiet and darkness in a city that never sleeps gave the couple time for reflection.

NYC elections board still assessing damage to polling sitesBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Nov 1, 2012Tweet0

The government agency in charge of elections in New York City has closed two of its five offices due to Monday night's storm, and its administrators do not yet know whether any polling stations are too damaged to use on Election Day.
Board of Elections Commissioner Maria Guastella said in a statement that the agency's Manhattan and Staten Island offices have been unusable since Monday, when the storm first knocked out power and flooded many areas of the city. The BOE has opened a temporary midtown Manhattan office at 33rd Street, but the Staten Island office is closed indefinitely.
The agency is assessing damage to its more than 1,000 voting stations, many of them at schools, where New Yorkers are supposed to vote on Tuesday. By law, voters may cast ballots only at the polling stations in the neighborhoods where they are registered.
Valerie Vazquez, a BOE spokeswoman, did not answer a question Yahoo News sent by email asking whether people  evacuated from destroyed homes in Staten

NYT called out city’s flood-protection problems in SeptemberBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Wed, Oct 31, 2012Tweet0

In a prescient New York Times article in September, scientists warned that New York City could become paralyzed for a month or more if a storm—or rising sea levels caused by climate change—caused significant flooding.
This passage, flagged by Reuters' Felix Salmon, stands out in particular:
Consolidated Edison, the utility that supplies electricity to most of the city, estimates that adaptations like installing submersible switches and moving high-voltage transformers above ground level would cost at least $250 million. Lacking the means, it is making gradual adjustments, with about $24 million spent in flood zones since 2007.
Scientists have been saying for years that the city is at risk due to rising sea levels.
Currently, 250,000 ConEd customers in lower Manhattan are without power, and city officials say it could take several more days for it to be restored. The utility company's transformers at a facility on 14th Street exploded during the storm surge Monday night, raising the

New Yorkers beat hasty retreat from power-less lower ManhattanBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Oct 30, 2012Tweet0

New Yorkers are used to walking farther--and faster--than denizens of other cities, but the extraordinary circumstances of Monday night's massive storm have forced people to make much longer and more arduous treks than normal.
Everywhere on Manhattan's Lower East Side on Tuesday, people--some en route to the homes of family or friends--were emerging with duffel bags and suitcases from electricity-free walk-up apartment buildings, and then shooting their arms out into the air in hopeful attempts to hail taxis.
These New Yorkers for the most part escaped the storm's wrath, which led to the death of 12 in the city, but now face lingering power outages that have plunged this part of Manhattan into darkness.
Many were unable to find cabs. The subway--expected to be closed for days--is not an option.
Becca Endryck, a senior at New York University, decided to walk over the Williamsburg Bridge to Brooklyn, laden with two duffel bags and a backpack. Her Broome Street apartment in the neighborhood of SoHo lost both power and water early Monday night, so she decided to stay with friends who live in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. Endryck looked for a cab for nearly half an hour before deciding to make the nearly five-mile trek with her things.
"I don't want to be in Manhattan," she said.
It's not hard to understand why. The electricity company ConEd said Tuesday that 230,000 of its customers in lower Manhattan could be without power for four days as the company attempts to repair damage to its equipment from the storm surge. Though a few stores were open--including a Chinese restaurant called The Happy Wok on Houston Street, where employees passed out Styrofoam takeout containers of food through a cracked-open door in exchange for cash--the usually bustling Lower East Side seemed abandoned. Streetlights, many at usually busy intersections, weren't working, but few cars were on the road.

Stuck Staten Island residents ask local leaders for rescueBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Oct 30, 2012Tweet0

The storm caused by Hurricane Sandy has downed trees, flooded homes and damaged streets in the New York City borough of Staten Island. On the island's south shore, trapped residents, some of whom ignored evacuation orders, pleaded with local officials on Facebook to send help to their flooded homes.
Many families were stuck in their attics as they retreated from the rising flood waters, while some even less fortunate were forced to seek help from their rooftops. "Family of 5 trapped on 2nd fl since yesterday included fireman and baby," one Facebook poster wrote on Staten Island City Councilman James Oddo's Facebook page, adding the specific address. "2 adults 2 dogs trapped since yesterday in the attic please help," another person wrote. Oddo wrote that he would pass on the many addresses posted on his page to Council Speaker Christine Quinn and the city's emergency management services. Many people could not get through to 911 last night because the system was so overloaded with calls--about 20,0000 per hour--and were thus trying Facebook and Twitter as a last resort.
Mio Delgado, a former New York City EMT who now lives in North Carolina, tells Yahoo News she has yet to hear if her family members who are trapped in a two-story home on Midland Beach have been rescued. The water had risen to the second floor of the house Monday night, and Delgado's grandmother, father, sister, and the sister's two young children gathered in the attic to escape the flood. Delgado's sister heard her neighbors yelling, "I don't want to die, somebody please help us" as the hours wore on. When Delgado's sister finally got through to 911 on her cell phone, a dispatcher told her first responders were only able to rescue people stuck on their roofs, and would return for them later. As of Tuesday morning, when Delgado lost contact with her sister, the family was still trapped inside their home.

‘Superstorm’ blaze: At least 50 homes destroyed in massive fire in Queens, N.Y.By Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Oct 30, 2012Tweet0

Hurricane Sandy may have left the region, but New Yorkers woke up today to flooding, fires and destruction.
A six-alarm fire in Breezy Point, Queens—a coastal area under mandatory evacuation order ahead of the storm—has destroyed about 50 to 100 buildings. Nearly 200 firefighters have responded to the massive blaze, a challenge to battle because first responders had to wade through chest-high water to reach the homes.
Firefighters told ABC News they rescued 25 people gathered in one apartment there. So far, no casualties from the fire have been reported.
[Updated photos: Massive fire in flooded Queens]
The New York Fire Department kept New Yorkers informed on Twitter as Sandy tore through the city Monday night, causing several small fires as well as the total collapse of the facade of an apartment building in the tony Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea.
At one point, the fire department implored people on Twitter not to use the social media site in place of 911, as some were asking for

Boston Globe: Romney rejected birth certificate changes for gay parentsBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Oct 26, 2012Tweet0
Mitt Romney in Iowa. (Getty)Mitt Romney rejected a plan while governor of Massachusetts that would have allowed same-sex married couples to both be listed as the parents of children born to them, the Boston Globe reports from state records it obtained this month.
After the state's highest court legalized gay marriage in 2003, the Registry of Vital Records presented a plan to change the "father" box on Massachusetts birth certificates to say "father or second parent." Romney rejected the plan, the paper writes, and said same-sex parents would have to personally request that the governor's office change their children's birth certificates. Parents and clerks complained the special procedure caused delays.
Romney explained his opposition to the change to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2004, according to the Globe. "The children of America have the right to have a father and a mother,'' Romney said. "What should be the ideal for raising a child? Not a village, not 'parent A' and 'parent B,' but a mother and a

CNN takes down ‘Do hormones drive women’s votes?’ story after Twitter backlashBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Oct 25, 2012Tweet0
(Thinkstock.com)A CNN.com story headlined "Do hormones drive women's votes?" sparked a social media backlash that lasted for seven hours Wednesday before the network removed the post late that night.
The story, posted in the website's medical and health section Wednesday afternoon, began, "There's something that may raise the chances for both presidential candidates that's totally out of their control: women's ovulation cycles."
The story cited a new study to be published in Psychological Science by Kristina Durante, an assistant professor in the marketing department at the University of Texas at San Antonio and the study's main author. Durante's online surveys of several hundred women led her to conclude that when they are ovulating, single women espouse more liberal beliefs, while married or committed women gravitate toward more conservative views.
(The same journal published a study in October concluding that the more muscular a man is, the more likely he is to support government policies that serve his self-interest, such as low taxes for the rich if he is wealthy.)
CNN said Durante hypothesized that single women "feel sexier" when ovulating and thus "lean more toward liberal attitudes on abortion and marriage equality." Married women, trying to resist their "sexy" feelings, do the opposite.
Durante wrote in an email to Yahoo News that there were some "misunderstandings" of her research in the CNN piece, but did not elaborate. "While we recognize that studies of gender and behavior are often controversial, we stand behind the integrity of this study and the journal," a spokeswoman for The Association for Psychological Science said in a statement. The spokeswoman added that Durante's comments about the research "are hers alone."

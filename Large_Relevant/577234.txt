Mexico blast kills at least 33, flagging Pemex safety woes 
Feb 2, 2013   

 MEXICO CITY (Reuters) – Rescue workers pulled out more bodies from debris at the headquarters of Mexican state oil giant Pemex on Friday after a powerful explosion killed at least 33 people and threw a spotlight onto the state-run company’s poor safety record. Scenes of confusion and chaos outside the downtown tower block in Mexico City have dealt another blow to Pemex’s image, just as Mexico’s new president is seeking to court outside investment for the 75-year-old monopoly. Thursday’s blast occurred at a Pemex building next to the 50-story skyscraper, and senior officials said 33 people had so far been confirmed dead.

No charges over UK royal nurse hoax call 
Feb 1, 2013   

  LONDON (Reuters) – British prosecutors said on Friday two Australian radio hosts who made a prank call to the hospital treating Prince William’s pregnant wife Kate would face no criminal charges over the death of the nurse who answered the phone and later killed herself. Indian-born Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was found hanged last December in her hospital lodgings in London, days after she answered the hoax call from DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian at Australian radio station 2Day FM. As part of the ruse, the pair had pretended to be Queen Elizabeth and William’s father, heir to the throne Prince Charles.

Hardly. There has been bushfires and flooding in summer in Australia long before it was inhabited by people.﻿ Natural weather conditions for us.

We are almost through to﻿ the end of Summer (our usual time of floods and bushfires) so we Aussies get to look forward to Winter.

              1 day ago
            



Because its our Cyclone season and the monsoons come﻿ down into the Northern parts of Australia between December and March / April. What they didn't explain was the foam and the floods were both caused by ex tropical cyclone that traveled south south-east and inland down the QLD coast and fed by a 'very' hot sea. It had destructive winds up to 120-130km.

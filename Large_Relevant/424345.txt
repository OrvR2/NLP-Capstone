If you did not know the name Amor "Lilman" Arteaga, you will now. Arteaga is a pintsize 9-year-old rapper from Brooklyn. His first music video, "Pull Ya Pants Up," featured Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, and it went viral over the summer. The video addressed the trend of guys wearing their pants sagging and has amassed more than 107,000 views to date.
Lilman spent the fall working on a new video for his song called "Stop da Violence." The song addresses issues like bullying, gun violence, and domestic violence. As Lilman raps, there's even a crowd of  schoolchildren singing "Put the guns down" throughout the video.
After the horrific shooting that took place December 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Lilman decided to include a tribute at the end of his video to the 20 students and six teachers who were killed.
Lilman stresses how important it is for young people to be aware of what's happening around them and how effective it can be to have an open dialogue with one another. Lilman has hopes of meeting President Barack Obama and discussing how he can help the country. "Obama should listen to me. If we work together, we can make a difference. I am young. I can reach an audience that politicians and other grownups try to relate to, but they really don't know what to say."
Arteaga joined "Trending Now" in the studio to talk about his inspiration for the song and what he hopes will happen because of it.

You will notice that most multiple-victim shootings occur in “gun-free zones” – even within states that have concealed-carry laws: public schools, churches, Sikh temples, post offices, the movie theater where James Holmes committed mass murder, and the Portland, Ore., mall where a nut starting gunning down shoppers a few weeks ago.

Guns were banned in all these places. Mass killers may be crazy, but they’re not stupid.

If the deterrent effect of concealed-carry laws seems surprising to you, that’s because the media hide stories of armed citizens stopping mass shooters. At the Portland shooting, for example, no explanation was given for the amazing fact that the assailant managed to kill only two people in the mall during the busy Christmas season.

It turns out, concealed-carry-holder Nick Meli hadn’t noticed that the mall was a gun-free zone. He pointed his (otherwise legal) gun at the shooter as he paused to reload, and the next shot was the attempted mass murderer killing himself. (Meli aimed, but didn’t shoot, because there were bystanders behind the shooter.)

In a nonsense “study” going around the Internet right now, Mother Jones magazine claims to have produced its own study of all public shootings in the last 30 years and concludes: “In not a single case was the killing stopped by a civilian using a gun.”

This will come as a shock to people who know something about the subject.

The magazine reaches its conclusion by simply excluding all cases where an armed civilian stopped the shooter: They looked only at public shootings where four or more people were killed, i.e., the ones where the shooter wasn’t stopped.

If we care about reducing the number of people killed in mass shootings, shouldn’t we pay particular attention to the cases where the aspiring mass murderer was prevented from getting off more than a couple rounds?

It would be like testing the effectiveness of weed killers, but refusing to consider any cases where the weeds died.

In addition to the Portland mall case, here are a few more examples excluded by the Mother Jones methodology:

    Mayan Palace Theater, San Antonio, Texas, this week: Jesus Manuel Garcia shoots at a movie theater, a police car and bystanders from the nearby China Garden restaurant; as he enters the movie theater, guns blazing, an armed off-duty cop shoots Garcia four times, stopping the attack. Total dead: Zero.

    Winnemucca, Nev., 2008: Ernesto Villagomez opens fire in a crowded restaurant; concealed-carry permit-holder shoots him dead. Total dead: Two. (I’m excluding the shooters’ deaths in these examples.)
    Appalachian School of Law, 2002: Crazed immigrant shoots the dean and a professor, then begins shooting students; as he goes for more ammunition, two armed students point their guns at him, allowing a third to tackle him. Total dead: Three.
    Santee, Calif., 2001: Student begins shooting his classmates – as well as the “trained campus supervisor”; an off-duty cop who happened to be bringing his daughter to school that day points his gun at the shooter, holding him until more police arrive. Total dead: Two.
    Pearl High School, Mississippi, 1997: After shooting several people at his high school, student heads for the junior high school; assistant principal Joel Myrick retrieves a .45 pistol from his car and points it at the gunman’s head, ending the murder spree. Total dead: Two.
    Edinboro, Pa., 1998: A student shoots up a junior high school dance being held at a restaurant; restaurant owner pulls out his shotgun and stops the gunman. Total dead: One.

    By contrast, the shootings in gun-free zones invariably result in far higher casualty figures – Sikh temple, Oak Creek, Wis. (six dead); Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Va. (32 dead); Columbine High School, Columbine, Colo. (12 dead); Amish school, Lancaster County, Pa. (five little girls killed); public school, Craighead County, Ark. (five killed, including four little girls).

    All these took place in gun-free

Ummm......this does not seem appropriate to me. 
Can the media and everyone else just let these people bury their children and family members in peace? How did this country allow it to become a media circus of sorts? How very sad. What have we become?

use a 9 year old kid as a pawn to promote the raping and taking away of our guns when in reality it keeps people away from the real reason as to why there is violence: psychiatric drugs.

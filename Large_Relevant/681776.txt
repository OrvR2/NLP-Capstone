A maintenance worker was wounded in the crossfire during a shooting at a Texas community college on Tuesday, school and police officials say.
The shooting on Lone Star College's North Harris campus began when an altercation involving two individuals escalated shortly before 1 p.m. local time, according to police. The maintenance worker suffered multiple gunshot wounds and is listed in serious condition. A second victim, thought to be a student, suffered an apparent heart attack during the incident. Both victims were conscious when they arrived at the hospital, officials said.
One of the suspects was taken into custody at the scene, while a second fled the campus on foot. According to a Harris County Sheriff's Maj. Armando Tello, five law enforcement agencies searched a wooded area near the school, where the second suspect was taken into custody. Both suspects, whose names were not released, were also wounded. Charges have yet to be filed.
"We do know a handgun was involved," Tello said, adding that at least one of the suspects was carrying a student ID.
According to Lone Star College chancellor Richard Carpenter, the shooting occurred between an academic building and the library on the campus, located 20 miles north of downtown Houston.
An alert posted on the school's website shortly before 1 p.m. warned students to take shelter. "LSC-North Harris is locked down," the alert read. "Students, faculty and staff are advised to take immediate shelter where you are. Do not enter the campus until notified further." Four nearby schools were placed on precautionary lockdown.

Aerial footage showed SWAT team members evacuating students from several buildings on the campus as ATF, FBI and local police searched the wooded area.
In interviews with local media outlets, students described a chaotic scene. A female student told KTRK-TV she heard five shots fired in an area between the library and the cafeteria. Other students said they heard gunshots when they were in cafeteria.
"I was just sitting in my room academic building, room 163 when I heard gun shots," Twitter user @Amandaplease223 wrote. "Rapid shots. In the hallway."
The Lone Star College system has a total enrollment of more than 90,000 students across six campuses, according to its website. About 10,000 people attend classes at Lone Star College-North Harris.
The shooting comes a little more than five weeks after 26 people—including 20 children—were killed when a gunman opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., sparking a national debate on gun control.
Guns are not allowed to be carried on college campuses in Texas. But earlier this week, Texas Sen. Brian Birdwell introduced legislation that would allow students to carry concealed weapons "on university property for personal protection."
According to the school's website, Lone Star College prohibits "knowingly, intentionally or recklessly" setting foot on school property with a firearm.
The website also includes an extensive section on what to do in an active shooter situation. It reads in part:

If they do start shooting people, you need to make a choice: stay still and hope they do not shoot you, run for an exit while zigzagging, or attack the shooter.
If you chose to run, a zigzagging moving target is much harder to hit than a straight runner.
Playing dead may also be a consideration.
It is not a recommendation to attack the shooter, but remember that you have a choice to fight when there are no other options.
The last thing that the shooter will expect is to be attacked by you.

When you fear your mom more than the cops then you're being raised correctly!

Ryan,
My children aren't afraid of me. My 22 year-old son could whip me in an instant, if he wanted to. But, he respects me, and has a firm understanding that there are consequences for breaking rules... which he learned from a few spankings before he was 10. And, as a teen & young adult; he has made significantly better choices than his classmates who never knew a hand across their backside. 
You act as though spankings are given in the absence of an explanation, or a lesson. Your impression seems to be that we don't love our kids or show affection. 
You're wrong.
But love in the absence of strict discipline, is incomplete and ineffectual parenting. 
I love my kids unconditionally; and they love me back... not despite the spankings, but because of them.

My kids never beat up on each-other, or their classmates. They were well behaved and respectful of all adults (even those who didn't deserve it). They have neither been perpetrators - nor victims - of spousal or partner abuse. 

Instances of parricide are not limited to situations where the killer was a victim of abuse. And in the instances where abuse was a cause; there was always a pattern of mental abuse... but only sometimes included physical abuse. And plenty of instances of parricide are perpetrated by spoiled children with severe entitlement issues (like the Menendez brothers). Children whose bad behavior is ignored by the parents, or never addressed in a manner which gives those kids pause... THAT is what leads to parricide.

Check the local affiliate story.  They are reporting that it was a drug/gang related shooting.

How about instead of night after night of reality shows the networks try some educational programming that helps people see the warning signs of mental illness in their friends and family members? How about educational programming that helps people learn some basic communication skills so we can have a less violent society, hopefully, someday? How about something, anything!!!!!! Parents, stop parking your kids with video games and talk to them, help them, parent them! How about more time off for people so they can spend time with their families instead of working themselves to death? The whole society has to change!

Time for parents to realize there kids arent the little angels they thought. 
If you see your kid is having problems dont just assume it will blow over.  
Talk to them, get them help if they have access to a gun take it away.
Be a responsible parent, dont wait for something to happen then try to 
blame it on everyone else.

It is absolutely amazing, in the past 30 years I have seen the blame for such things go from the movies kids watch to the video games they play. Blaming it on peer pressure, hyperactivity, depression, so on and so forth.

The real problem in todays society is the fact that kids now days are not held responsible for what they do growing up.  There is no consequence to their actions.  Example # 1:  Little Bobby at 5 years old bites holes in Susies arm. Punishment:  No,no,no, Bobby and sit him in a chair for 15 minutes.  #2  Bobby at 10 years old smashes the neighbors window out with a rock. Punishment:  No, no, no Bobby and make him go to his room to play on his computer and watch tv.  #3  Bobby at 17 gets drunk and robs a 7-11.  Punishment:  Parents bail him out and tell him "We understand, it's just because you're misunderstood".  #4  Bobby at 20 goes to college and shoots people.  End result:  Parents claim, "I dont understand,  Bobby has always been a good boy"

Stop letting your children run wild, be a parent not a babysitter, punish your children for doing wrong and stop letting then tell you what they can and cannot do.

If the government cannot keep drugs out of prison and cannot stop illegal immigrants from crossing the border... how can the government prevent guns from ending up in criminal hands???

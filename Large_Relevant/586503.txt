Did you hear how he said: "I watch Star Trek TNG", now considering the fact that there is a finite amounts of episode you can conclude that he has watched all of them and yet is continuing to re watch themďťż several times over. That's a real nerd.

If you don't still have a character sheet and a 20 sided die from your 1995 AD&D group you aren't a nerd. If you never dressed up to go to a ren fest, you aren't a nerd. Ifďťż you own a fixed gear bike, that doesn't make you a nerd.

Wow. This video REALLY pisses me off. He's just so... wrong. Everything he said. The only thing you need to be a "real nerd" is a passion for something. Generally something that most people don't care much about(games, comics, anime, etc.), but it doesn't need to be something like that. You can be a nerd about cars. You can be a nerd about football. "A real nerd isďťż ashamed to be called a nerd"? God dammit. I'm legitimately upset by this thing.

I don't why all of sudden everyone wants to be a "nerd" or "geek".
So now the definition has been changed to "Well if you're very obsessed and into shit you're a nerd guys!"
How about this, be into what the fuck you're into. Shut the hellďťż up, you don't need a word for it. No one needs "nerd pride" like it's an oppressed group or some shit.

To anyone who thinks like this guy: stop being afraid of women. Live your lifeďťż like you belong where you are, and stop worrying about what other people are doing. If an attractive woman is in the same room with you, she either wants to be your friend or has no interest in you; she's not there to ridicule you. Not everything is about you. You don't get to tell others what to call themselves; get over yourself.

Can't tell if it's supposed to be sarcastic or not (I'm guessing it is), but I disagree with the "real nerds are ashamed to be called nerds"ďťż and "if you know you're a nerd, you're not a nerd" things. For some of us, it's our identity. If I'm not a nerd, what am I? If I were told to say what I was without saying "nerd" or "geek", I honestly would have no clue what to say I was.

In my school being a nerd is a badge of honor, the deeper your involved in the internet the better. We fans of doctor who, my little pony, anime, skyrim, and many other things make up the majority of our school, theďťż other half of ours schools is generally carried out in handcuffs but still, we're the majority. We don't call ourselves nerds but we call the drunks, stoners, and partiers retarded and laugh as they're kicked out.

Who cares?ďťż It's not like we're talking about gay rights or the rights of POC. It's not like we're talking about some asshole doing blackface. Who cares if someone fakes being a nerd? I'd say it is a victim-less crime, but it isn't even close to being a crime. Sometimes I pretend to be a cat. I know I'm not really a cat, but thankfully my cat doesn't freak out on me because I'm participating in catplay, acting like I'm invading his culture. Be more like a cat. Lay about, don't worry, have fun.

Try to focus on the fact that we make friends through shared interests. Maybe it'll beďťż a chance to meet new people and work through some of the social awkwardness. You won't have to be self-conscious about what you like.
Maybe I'm being ignorant, though. I grew up on Star Trek Voyager and Magic: The Gathering, but I've also had other outlets that are less nerdy, so I was able to dip my toes into both worlds a bit. Everything in moderation....

If Skyrim makes you a nerd, then watching the Discovery Channel makesďťż you a scientist. It's like one of the most popular video games out right now, you aren't a special snowflake for playing it, and it certainly doesn't make you a nerd.

For a lot of people, being called "Nerd" usually was followed by being beaten up by other kids or being put down for their choice of hobby. Hence the whole uproar over "Fake nerd/geeks"ďťż and such.

I get the frustration, I wasn't exactly bullied when I was a kid but I've had my fair share of people just not getting where I come from. The dishonesty of attaching yourself toďťż a certain niche for the sole reason that "It's in" is really transparent. Still, just because a group of people puts you down doesn't mean that you should be ashamed of what you like.

You have good taste. No one can really define whatďťż a nerd is. You KNOW it when you SEE it. However, nerds are shut-ins with poor confidence/NEET/intelligent/un­attractive/eclectic/poor health. Subscribing to 'nerd culture' has nothing to do with being a nerd. These works of fiction were created to be good shows/books/animations/games for general audiences in the first place. A lack of a social life, gives nerds more time to digest them. And that satirical PSA perfectly describes the wardrobe.

Okay, first: all identitiesďťż contain a minimum of discrimination because that's the nature of identity, that you have a certain kind of quality or qualities or don't. No one here is saying that nerds are better or superior to others, they ARE saying nerds have certain defining characteristics. Not controversial. Second: They aren't saying attractive people cannot be nerds, they are saying that a passing interest in a popular movie or book does not a nerd make. Again, not controversial. Gah.

I enjoy science, scifi, fantasy, board and computer games, rpgs, comics, and crafting. I watch movies that are terrible because I enjoy watching terrible movies. (Manos anyone?) I am an introvert and often don't understand people's political games so I say what Iďťż mean and try to avoid getting involved which makes me less than popular. I am an equalist ( I am not sure that's a word, but if feminist can be so should equalist). But I am an attractive girl so I am not allowed to say I am a nerd?

You calledďťż yourself an attractive girl.
You're automatically a bitch that's just pretending to be a nerd.

You're a nerd because of the first two sentences. That's the point. They aren't saying attractive people cannot be nerds,ďťż they are saying that a passing interest in a popular movie or book does not a nerd make.

In the English language, context is everything and the context to which he states "a sexy woman seeing Avengers on the second weekend - not a nerd" implies a context that attractive people are not real nerds. Which is completeďťż bullshit, and you know it. This video opened its mouth and inserted its foot.
Btw, I'm a nerd and I'm proud to be a nerd. My friends are proud to be nerds too. I'm not ashamed of my interests, hobbies, or choice of entertainment. Why should I be ashamed?

A nerd (adjective: nerdy) is a person, typically described as being overly intellectual, obsessive, or sociallyďťż impaired. "Nerd" is a derogatory, stereotypical term, but as with other pejoratives, it has been reclaimed and redefined by some as a term of pride and group identity. The point is the term hurts people, but for some reason is socially acceptable to use. There would be outrage if people who like dressing nice started calling themselves "fags".

I agree that, if your interpretation was right, it would be bullshit. I just don't think the context implies that at all.ďťż Rather, if he had said, "a sexy woman who sees the opening midnight screening of Avengers is not a nerd," I would agree completely with you. The problem isn't that she's sexy or not sexy, but that her cursory interest in a movie that is also enjoyed by nerds is not itself nerd cred.

I don't want to get into a big debate about it, so I will say that even thoughďťż I disagree with what you affirm, I completely agree with what you reject (that is, the idea that a nerd can't be attractive). To that idea I can only agree with you 100% and the rest of your points are well taken.

I agree with you to some extent. I find the show pretty entertaining, but not as much as most people claim it to be. The reason people say this show is super hilarious is because it's "cool" to like Portlandia. Plain and simple. I'm prepared to take the hate. Similar to how being a nerd is "cool". Some people overdo it.ďťż Just like how it's "cool" to like Doctor Who. In all honesty, that show isn't all that good. I just like funny one-liners.

Fact there were real girls who are nerds I know b/c they were right next to me crying along with me when we'd get brutalized at school for just following our own drummers. A nerd was an insult and the people who experienced as an insult will never forget it. And yes it is now a trend but actual people who were nerds never have been confused by this. Trends are purely aimed at the commodity value of its use. 'pop-nerd' culture is aďťż commodity at least for the time being.

Furthermore, Nerds never actually labled themselves we were ridiculed with the name. And trying to define what is legit 'nerd' and isnt, is futile, a game of one uppers. Doing that which calls to you is following a joy. Its been my experience that the dif between me and those who mocked me were I found what I like by curiosity, and they found what they liked by popular trend. Even then I was following my own version ofďťż a trend, as I had to discover it from something.

Finally, all nerd has amounted to in its contemporary use is trying to designate oneself as an outsider amongst their surroundings.
That is the true difference of the formal nerd and pop-nerd. People like me were intentionally segregated from the masses or norm whether we cared or not we were isolated.
Those declaring themselves now are attempting to accentuate themselves from their self chosen circles but theyďťż are not unwillingly excluded from a group.

When did being a nerd or nerdy, or for that matter being very smart became a trend and popular? Is it now? Are you talking about Geek Chick stuff where someone puts on glasses and a plaid shirt and they think they makes them nerdy looking/smart? Because that is just a simple fashion statement IMO. So can you please enlighten me? whatďťż am I missing, a show like Glee? (I should add that I don't watch TV) Can you Name 5 current popular nerds/intellectuals to help me figure out what I am missing?

I kind of take offense to this video. Why do people have to be ashamed to be a nerd? As a proud nerdfighter I know that being a nerd isn't a bad thing. Why is it bad to be excited about things? Ps: nerdsďťż do come in all shapes and sizes. Just because someone is a girl who occasionally likes to wear top buns does not mean they cannot be a nerd.

I've worked for Hoffman international modeling & talent for about 3 years and now serve in the military in intelligence - and I respect you my friend (: I would rather be an official nerd, than let my ego get the better of me!

Labels don't actually matter.
That isn't exactly true. Labels don't matter to YOU. You should not care whatďťż label you are, because what people have decided labels should be has no bearing on who you want to be. However, other people WILL use labels to stereotype you. If you want to be a nerd, you dress like one, act like one, talk like one. If you want to be "popular", same thing.

Why must being a NERD involve social awkwardness? I have a moderately healthy sex life, and have no trouble talking to women. I have a few major friends, and a bunch of minor ones. I don't dress like a blind person. I'm not as healthy as I should be, but I'm active, and loveďťż to play sports. Above all else, I love video games (so excited for GTA V I could fuckin scream), comics and manga, movies, and gadgets. Fake nerds, kill yourselves. Real nerds, get over yourselves.

I'm an actual nerd but I am not offended by it at all.......in fact I am veryďťż proud of my love for Stargate, Farscape, Startrek, over 5000 hours of halo, dead space, the conventions I go to, my autograph posters, my graphic novels, current 300 hours of skyrim, all sci-fi movies that exist, and my versions cosplay gear. (that's just the tip of my passions)
Just because you are a nerd does not mean you need to be social awkward. I am a full time college student, with a girl friend, with friend

i spelled the word differently to deter from the derogatory meaning it is usually associated with, and place a different interpretation on the word. What's theďťż matter?

it sucks that i get glasses that are hipster glasses and people tell me tey like them.

The biker, who's whole personna screams Harley Davidson. The sports fan who buys his car in the team color and a Nike logo on everything he owns. The gangsta who carries a Glock and knows every line of dialog in Scarface. The amateur fisherman with matching camo truck and boat sportingďťż gear sponsor decals. And yes, the nerd, who now also allows pop culture to determine his identity.

I wouldn't label you as a nerd...I thinkďťż that it's just that people now days are into all these "fads" and you just aren't into them. You like other things that are completely different and that isn't wrong. You shouldn't be ashamed of liking something or being different. What gives people the right to judge you? Nothing. Being a nerd isn't a bad thing...and all the things you listed on your opinion on what characteristics make up a nerd...I don't agree with that. Everybody looks different so d

Meh... thisďťż is only one type of nerd. A nerd (for me at least) is someone who has math formulas postered to his/her wall and a shelf full of computer programming books. Someone who spends everyday studying and was in 10th grade math in 8th grade. In my opinion being a nerd isnt a bad thing.

Being a nerd means being passionate about something whether it be a book or a game or a movie, whatever. The only difference between a real fake and a real nerd is that the fake doesn't have any passion towards the thing that they claim to be a nerd for. The real nerds will think deeply about their favorite book and devote hours to their hobbies. You don't have to devote hours to become a nerd but you just have to haveďťż a great love for the past time. If you don't care at all, you aren't a nerd

I'm strange looking, awkward around girls, have a strange sense of humor, and was at least at the head of my weirdo group in high school. Nerd is too simplistic to justify my status. Inďťż fact a lot of nerds rejected me in high school. No, I'm on the fringe of society, but it's ok. I made my own way in life. I don't find that worrying about other's perceptions even enters my mind. Instead my happiness is a biproduct of my outlook and not my goal. Fuck hipsters and fuck nerds! Hazaa!!!

I call myself a nerd because I stutter when i talk, i used to be deeply addicted to video gaming, my only friends were other people who didn't "fit in", and I get 100's on all of my math tests. I choose not to constantly be around people not because i fear talking to them, but because i don't want to become like them. I want to be my own person and make all of the right decisions by myself. I don't fit in because hardly anyone can understand why I do what I do. I prefer a nerdďťż over anyone.

Youďťż guys are the hipster here, you claim to be a nerd because you want that title really badly; don't tell me that I can't tell through a comment because if you were a nerd you wouldn't have to constantly remind yourselves of the 'fact' by posting comments about it on Youtube. Stop reaching for a meaningless title because ultimately it just slows your progress in doing the cool things that might make you smart or interesting.

You know he can choose toďťż change some of his appearance. He doesn't have to dress like that more does he have to wear those specific glasses. He could shave. A lot of things. Of course he'll still like needy things, but he will look better.

That's a pretty shitty definition.
A) Most have some sortďťż of social anxiety, but they usually have no problems talking to people like them (other nerds)
B) Video/computer games aren't the only hobbies nerds have. In fact, most nerds have several "nerdy" hobbies which the main factor of being a nerd.
C) Usually true, but I've known plenty of dumb people who I'd still consider nerds.
D) Very few nerds are completely distant when it come to a social life. They just hang out with other nerds.

Well those people are idiots if they consider themselves nerdsďťż for considering themselves even relatively smart, nerd has many defenitions, hell yours might be completely wrong to others since a nerd can be anything nowadays really.
But then again, who gives a fuck if you or I m a nerd or not, we like what we want, in fact, what was truly the point of this video other than to piss the mainstream off.

Yes I still would because I am a sad sack of shit according to 5 people and I should die in a fire for having an opinion that nobody agrees with. I am a troll according to 5 others who disagree with me and an atheist according to one random person. And I really don't care about the Conneticut shooting, mostly because I rather not remember it since aďťż family member of mine actually lost someone there. Thanks for bringing it up by the way, didn't bring up bad memories at all.

While nerd may no longer mean social outcast, it hints strongly at social anxiety. Take 30 pirates out of a rennaissance faire (without booze and costumes), and put them in a wedding reception, and they'll all be awkward again. Even if they're together! Nerds need safe spaces and ridiculously obvious common interests. This is why so many nerds are also kinky, pagan, or polyamorous. I don'tďťż believe popular people (read: non-nerds) made the term okay. I think nerds gained vocabulary to speak out.

Alright guys, so I've seen a lot of comments of people getting offended, angry and upset because they're not a nerd, but no one seems to know what a nerd actually is.
So, in short a nerd is: Someone who's hobbies come before theirďťż social lives.
Alright?
Cool.

Be proud anytime; if Nerdfighteria has taught us anything, it's that Nerd is not and should not be seen as a pejorative term.

I see a lot of people in the comments getting offended, and it makes me laugh a little.
The overall point, atďťż least as I see it, is not really the appearance of a nerd, but rather the insane annoyance of young teens running around screaming OH MAN I'M SUCH A NERD OLOLOLOL. That's attention whoring, not a love for technology, or gaming, or sci-fi.
It's not a generalization, it's just the fact that there are a lot of people using it to attention whore instead of having an honest enjoyment.

I think the complaint isn't so much that people are insincere about loving "nerdy" things. Video games areďťż fun. The Avengers is a good movie. The complaint, I think, is that people conflate liking the same things nerds like with being a nerd. It's not wrong to like video games, but it is disrespectful to shallowly self-identify as a nerd when that word means so much pain for people who are lambasted for being nerds.

I think some people have grown protective of the term "Nerd" because they identify it with the social pains theyďťż endured at some point in their life. "You can't be a nerd because you weren't ridiculed by your peers like I was." Someone with that sort of attitude sees someone (they believe is) pretty and/or popular throwing around "I'm such a nerd," and the resulting anger is not surprising. The terminology has changed with age though, and to be a Nerd is considered good if anything. Nerd=/=Shy

I think the term "nerd" as you describe it has been redefine as "neckbeard." Being a "nerd" is nothing to be ashamed of. Being a self-righteous "unique" neckbeard in a fedora, however... My favorite video games are BioShock, Skyrim, Silent Hill 3, and Dead Space. But I'm also a 19 year old girl who puts high priority on hygieneďťż and looking attractive, not just for others, but for myself, as well. There is more to life than having a pissing contest on who's a nerd and who isn't. This is silly.

I used to be really concerned about either making myself fit the label "Punk" or making the label "Punk" fit me. That was middle school and high school. Now I dress howeverďťż I happen to feel like dressing and listen to whatever I want and don't even think about whether or not what I'm doing is 'punk rock' or 'nerdy' or 'counter-culture'. I'm much happier because of it. I'm not label-less, but I've dropped these labels that have been redefined so many times that they are meaningless.

For some reason I love this debate. I don't think it's about saying "You're not cool enough to be a nerd" - it's about "You're not uncool enough to be a nerd." Times have changed - skinny pants are cool, as are weird mustaches and big glasses. Ranting aboutďťż "Game of Thrones" is cool. But none of it makes you a nerd. Someone earlier said it best - pain and social ostracism because of your social differences makes you a nerd. Jesus people, watch "Revenge of the Nerds." It's all there.

Theďťż people who get bent out of shape over defining who is and who is not an actual nerd are the same people who were ostracized in high school and alienated, and oddly enough, they tend to be more eager than most to use those same isolating belittling you're-not-good-enough-for-us tactics on others.

I think people are missing the point. This person is saying it hurts that when people call him a nerd, it's an insult because it means he's socially inept and unattractive, but when other people call themselves nerds, it's cool because it means they like video games. That's pretty harsh. The point is that you shouldn't call yourself a nerd without having a sense of what that word means to theďťż people it's used against.

That is a disgracefully bent definition of "nerd." The fact is that every single person is enthusiastic aboutďťż something, and so that word ceases to mean anything. That's the point of the PSA.
"A nerd (adjective: nerdy) is a person, typically described as being overly intellectual, obsessive, or socially impaired. " -Wikipedia

No, it fucking doesn't. A nerd is somebody who is passionate about their hobby, who is socially scorned and looked down upon. Somebody who literally has no life due to their hobby. It's notďťż some hip and cool "oh so edgy" crap. Being a nerd is a title earned through pain and frustration, not something that some hipster can claim by just liking something that isn't mainstream, you fucking cunt. I'd explain more if I could, but my character limit is rapidly decreasing.

"And nope, you cannot tell by someone's response if they areďťż a nerd or not."
Yes I can, it's because you're obviously offended by this video for some reason.
Quick definition of a nerd for you: some one who's hobbies are more important than their social lives.

You, my friend, are categorically Wrong. Many nerds' hobbies are what Create their social networks, not hamper them. We play D&D, various video- and tabletop games, go LARPing, and connect through social media as a means to connect to other nerds who share our same interests. Being introverted doesn't mean you are a hermit, just that you have a smaller, moreďťż intimate group of friends; on that subject, not all nerds are introverts.
Nerdiness is Who You Are, not What You Do.

But if a nerd had friends outside of their LARPing groups, that said they didn't want to be friends unless said nerd stopped LARPing, thay nerd would continue to LARP, becauseďťż that habby is more important to his/her social life.

If you have a friend or friends who would have you either quit a hobby or activity (that is not detrimental to your health) or no longer be your friend, then they weren't a friend worth having to begin with.
If a friend of mine said I had to quit playing D&D or they'd no longer associate with me, then I'd happily slam the door in their face,ďťż because they want me to be someone other than myself. I could make other friends who appreciate who I am and how my hobbies make me happy.

You seem to be missing the point; my D&Dďťż hobby IS PART of my social life, they are not mutually exclusive. My group of players Are my friends, both at and away from the gaming table. If a separate group of friends (Because Yes, you can have separate circles of friends, just ask Google+) essentially tells me I have to stop hanging out with the first group or they will ostracize me, then they weren't real "friends" in the first place.

Yes, but you're saying the group of friends that are involved in your hobby are more important than the ones that aren't.
Thusly your hobby is more important to you than your social life.
If all your D&D friends decided to stop playing, you would find a new group. You may still hang out with your old group but youďťż wouldn't stop just because your old group did.

Yes, that's what I'm saying. If said group of people would want me to quit a hobby that I enjoy, that makes me happy when playing, with the punishment for continued enjoyment being their extrication from my life, then they can leave. They're not real friends, because they're Telling me to do something that will make me unhappy.
If my fellowďťż players chose not to play anymore, I wouldn't stop being friends with them, that just means we wouldn't play D&D anymore.

It seems you're attaching an hyper-importanceďťż to the friends who are anti-gaming in this scenario. Lets flip the table: You enjoy video games. It's not harmful to others or yourself, you don't ignore your friends due to playing at all hours of day or night, in essence it has no negative ramifications on your overall quality of life. Lets say a "friend", for whatever arbitrary reason, says you have to quit gaming or they'll no longer associate with you. No particular reason. What then?

I think I see where our cognitive dissonance arises from - You're considering the person who is making demands of you as a 'friend'. In my scenario, this would be a 'friend' telling me I can't partake inďťż an activity with other friends who aren't making such a demand on me.
What I'm saying is I prioritize my Friends, real true friends, over my 'friends', whose friendship is conditional, meaning they weren't friends to begin with.

What I'm saying is that if there is someone in your life who would have you reduce the number of things that you enjoy due to their own sensibilities, with the consequence of their departure being punishment, then they aren't truly your friend. Let them go on about their business, becauseďťż if they Were your friend they would embrace you for who you are, even if your hobbies don't always align.

I don't see where I'm offended. I'm simply just not buying it. Me notďťż thinking the same way as you do and daring to say it doesn't mean I'm offended. And I still am not.
If that is the definition of a nerd I am definitely a nerd.

I apologize for misinterpreting your comment then, though the way you were wording your comment, calling what I was saying "crap" made me think you were getting offended by what I was saying.
Anyway, if you do fit what I statedďťż as being a nerd, then that's nice.
Going by your original comment, I think you were upset by this video because you thought it was excluding woman. Which is not what it's doing at all, it's excluding hipster that think they're nerds when they're not.

a good thing to remember is that hipsters claim everything and sometimes it's better to ignore it than try to fight them because you are more likely to hurt "your own" than to teach them anything. Hipstersďťż are people who believe they are unique and everything is theirs. There is no reasoning with them. They're shits. It's better to ignore it and wait for them to grow up and understand it.

He didn't say you can't be a nerd, he was essentially saying it's really annoying that "popular" people now wear fake glasses and pretend to be interested in games and stuff and say "OMFG, I'm, liek, totally a nerd orďťż whatever!", just so they can look interesting and unique, when not 10 years ago everyone was making fun of people for those same traits.
Also, you know what's really annoying? You turning this into some kind of anti-female thing, which it is clearly not. Idiot.

Just because someone is popular doesn'tďťż mean they cannot be a nerd. Nerd doesn't mean "social outcast".

Actually, up until 3 years ago when popular people started using it to be cute andďťż interesting, the word "nerd" did, in fact, mean "social outcast", and everyone who was labeled as a nerd was socially outcast.

wait... do you want to keep it as a derogatory term, or do you want to be accepted for being a nerd? You can't have it both ways. You can help the word evolve intoďťż something positive, and just let go of what those "omgz I'm totally x" because those "omg'ers" take everything and make it into theirs. Just ignore them. But this video made A LOT of people feel invalidated and shut out.

No, I want people to stop acting like dipshits and labelingďťż themselves as something just to seem cool.
And why would I want to be accepted for being a nerd if I'm not one?
And no, this video only made YOU feel invalidated. Everyone else thought this video was hilarious, except for you because you're either A) extremely insecure, or B) taking a lot of pleasure in being a whiny, immature child.
Don't falsely apply your feelings to everybody else when everybody else quite obviously enjoyed this.

No, this did not make ME feel invalidated. I was led here by several posts who talked about this particular video and how it made them feel. Thought I'd leave one comment and voĂ­la, people who don't know the art of STFU. What I am amused about is your need to belittle me simply becauseďťż I do not share your beliefs that this is a super funny show!
I am a confident person who is mature, I do however speak my mind and buddy, that doesn't make me either whiny or immature.

Sorry, I wasn't aware that sticking a "comedy" label on things made it all okay. I don't care about the label, it's this show that does. Are they aware of how many people they alienate by doing this? Even if it is comedy people stillďťż have a right to take an offense, and I was linked here BECAUSE people did.

Sounds like you're spending a little too muchďťż time imagining scenarios and subtexts to be offended by. This is a comedy skit. It's also a story about a person who was harshly criticized for being a nerd, and now feels offended that cool people are turning the same word to mean a good thing when it's applied to themselves. The fact that it's directed at a woman specifically is superficial.

I'm sorry stupid dude-bros in the comments will attack you, you were right. But hey, it comes with the internet, unfortunately. If you dare mention anythingďťż feminist related you get shit, it's stupid. It's also quite stupid when you get offended over it and people are like "it's just a joke!" But it's good you are actually saying what you believe, and what is right.

thank you :) I'm a person who calls everything as I see it, and I don't believe anything gets a pass just because it's "humor", especially when it's offended people and made them feel excluded and invalidated simply for their gender or how they chose to "exercise their nerdiness", lol. People don't like it when they get reminded of their bullshit in places where they feel that they should be able to be "free ofďťż it" haha, nice to have a choice to be free of it, y'know ;) anyway, thanks!! :)

Yeah, I can understand people not wanting nerd to be positive for one person and negative for another, but just because someone is really extroverted doesn't mean they're not nerds. I was friends with quite a few genuine nerds in high school (people who ruined their thumbs from playing so much video games, and skipping school for days bc ofďťż a new release) who still had time to socialize and have fun. So Idk. I think it's up to you how you wear it and stop being playing a victim.

Perhaps they just want to play the victim? Oh trust me, I know what you mean. My best friend is the biggest nerd I've ever met, he runs several RPG(asďťż in D&D kinda) groups, plays WoW, proposed to his girlfriend by having us all run out and attack him with swords so he could "slay" us and "loot" the ring to propose. He's also extremely social. My fiance, who is also a giant nerd, was popular in HS, played football, doesn't look "nerdy" in the slightest.. he's just exactly the opposite.

Oh yes, have you met the "I'm not a feminist, I'm an equalist" or something? I distance myself a lot from the feminist movement due to it's lackďťż of intersectionality, but I doubt these "equalists" mean that. Or MRA's? hehe. I do get what that person meant though, as in acceptance in society, however I wouldn't compare on to the other, because that's just not at all helpful to anyone.

I have definitely met people like that. MRA's make me very, very sad. I saw one MRA compare feminist's "war on men" to the holocaust!! It was horrifying. I remember him saying something about misandry being worse than misogyny, too. He was honestly not a troll and linked to a video about the friendzone and "nice guys." It was pretty stereotypical but oh-so-pathetic. I getďťż that, and I agree, but they shouldn't be compared. It's not only counter-productive but insensitive.

Sorry for replying twice in a row, but I got cut off there: I, however, have social anxiety disorder, am very shy and quiet, far more stereotypical. Out of this giant group of nerdy friends, there are.. I'd say three that are likeďťż that. There are probably.. 20+ of us. Really none of the rest are stereotypical at all. This seems to be more normal than what is shown in this video. Oh well, though. If people want to be stupid, that's all up to them.

I'm sorry. :( That's tough. Brave of you to admit that, too, actually. People with mental illnesses generally aren'tďťż treated all that great. I've noticed a lot of people call people with depression spoiled brats and the like for not being happy. The world has a really screwed up view for the most part.

yeah, some people are awful. I know one girl who just went "cheer up, you choose your happines!" like oh yeah, I totally chose to be unable to get out of bed and being forced to drop out of school because of it! ugh. Luckily I'veďťż surrounded myself with people who understand, my best friend has had depression problems so she's a lot of help (I think these guys would really dislike her tho, she's a social butterfly nerd xD)

Oh my mom has always said that to me. It's so sad. My personal favorite was seeing a guy tell a girl who BEAT anorexia "Congratulations. Too bad youďťż gave it up though, I bet you were hot." Someone he had never seen! People are awful.

Mhm, she doesn't understand mental illnesses despite having a pretty severe case of OCD. My dadďťż was far worse, he honestly threatened to have me institutionalized for OCD. One of my really good friend's parents whine about her depression medicine costing so much and talk about how her therapy only costs them money and never does anything. They have even yelled at her for self harm instead of getting her help.

Please stop trying to make nerd culture a boys' club, and stop trying to rate people's "nerd cred" based on your interests, and stop perpetuating the myth that conventionally attractive women cannot also be nerds. I understand what you were attempting to do here, but all it's doing is coming across as misogynisticďťż and makes me roll my eyes.

The whole circle-jerk fest of being a nerd has been exhausted.
I read plenty of anime, read fantasbooks,ďťż play how many hours of old rpg's, and whatever else, and I'm not for washing each other's balls about nerd-ism and how cool it is. I respect the real nerds, the ones that do what they do because they're losers otherwise. There's a deep pain and their hobbies are what comfort them. I feel for them.
Saying nerd is ambiguous today means many things. It's a little tantamount to "I do sutff".

It helps that John Green isn't ugly. He may be authentic about his nerd-ish joys and at one point a loser, but the shift of context defeats the underdog sense of the word, the purpose of it. It's all socially acceptableďťż now, for one. Nerd is cool, defeating the purpose of championing it.
Attractive and socially skilled people can do whatever and it's cool; drinking jars of one's own piss would be cool if enough hot people started emerging from teenage acne.

So, I'm a mid-20's white guy, but now I want called myself an old, black woman. Never mind that I haven't earned the experience to call myself "old", or that I'm identifying with black culture without having any struggle or collective cultural history.
You know what? I'm classifying a new sub-culture for the group of white people who can't stop self-identifying as anyoneďťż but themselves: Hypocritically Indignant, Personality-Switching, Trendy, Entitled Refugees. I wish it was shorter, somehow...

Nerd isn't something I see as self-ascribed anymore.
It's like saying, "I'm really cool!" Well, that's for me to personally asses; something you show, notďťż tell.
I think nerd needs other tags to it. It's become ambiguous, hardly meaning anything, at least to me. And what's the point of saying nerd aloud if not something you're trying to communicate to a separate, sentinel being.
Some nerds are losers, and to see others use it as social status is a bit abusive to the term

I'm a Nerd and I'm proud to be one, and I too hate these fake nerds that are coming out of the wood work. A real nerd doesn't keep up with the latest trends or buy "hip" clothing that cost an arm and a leg. We nerds do what we want and dress how ever we want regardlessďťż of society's dictation on what is "cool".

"We nerds do what we want and dress how ever we want regardless of society's dictation on what is "cool"." - Well wouldn't thatďťż include someone wanting to keep up with the latest trends or buying "hip" clothing? Or are these real nerds expected to adhere to your personal tastes?

Thank you! I am covered by both of these definitions though, but I agree with John a little more. They both contain truth, but maybe notďťż all of it.

Most people that are called nerds, don't like to be called that. His point that hot girls and good looking guys have gravitated to that moniker as a defense mechanism towards criticism.ďťż it's a way of knocking yourself down before anyone else. To fend off criticism. Like Fat Amy in pitch perfect though she was justified but all the same a defense, the character was geniune about it. others that are not, I prefer to call those people what they are. Idiots.

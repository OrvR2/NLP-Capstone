It was﻿ way too similar to Code Geass and Vandread. In fact, it has the same "future" theme as Vandread. It was a good anime though.

I have to say this was a﻿ great animee. This is my second time watching it, and it was even more Epic than I remembered..haha For those who are looking for another good anime to watch, check out Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. It is not space bound, but has loving characters; kick-but action; amazing epic adventures; and that same pure romance this Heroic Age series has. It also has two seasons and two movies to add to it's story!

I hate that they didn't have a season two to legendary heroes. You have to﻿ read the manga to know what happens next.﻿ I kind of prefer to watch complete animes, but legendary heroes was still a good anime.

hahaha yeah it's a shame. its such a great show! thanks for the heads up,﻿ i didn't know the manga went farther than the anime. i know that legend of legendary heroes is actually a series of short stories, so i kind of gave up on it after the end of the anime because there are like 12 volumes and 2 parts to the mains story + side stories as far as light novels go. bottom line is we will most likely never get to learn how everything ends :(

So in the end, Princess Dhianeila was able to commuicate to all the other tribes, expand everyone's consciousness and understanding to end the wars,﻿ and prepare the human race for the true real journey to come. Setsuna F. Sesei(Gundam 00) would be proud of her accomplishments.

@Teldara dude cmon even if their love is pure a kiss scene woulda been perfect ... i think this anime is awesome but lacks emotion
also it woulda made the﻿ ending godlike :)

The ending is already good enough, no need to improve it. Besides there are so many animes like this that have a kiss scene I started to think each show was just a repeat of another in a way. And this﻿ anime does not lack emotion in any way!

Ending would have been best I think, if they had just stopped at 16:29. No damned '4 years' later. It's implied that the planet was restored.﻿ And they lived happily ever after.

Wait so did Deianera cross the gate??......no i don't think so right, I think they just sent Age back.
But anyway this anime was so ePiC, but wish there was a little more romance like some kissing/hugging, but ohh well. Storyline was very meaningful and detailed, LOVED ITT, wish they made a season 2!!!!! also songs in﻿ intro and ending were AwESOME!!!

 You know what? I have been thinking﻿ about this alot when I first seen it. I couldn't figure out whether Age came there to get her or came there to stay, since they cut off at the end.

i think he is back to stay bcuz if he was back to take her , the door would have had stay open and anyways she does to move to the new universe now but i think that was bcuz she wanted to fulfill her promise to Age which she did and that is why Age is back hinting that maybe they will move to the other﻿ universe and he is there to guide them...

 I'm thinking that Age just came back to do all the Age-ish things he used to do. I﻿ know Dhianeila is smart enough to not let her dumbass brothers take control of the Iron Tribe because she left for the Golden Tribe universe.
If Age did become "king" I honestly think he'd be pretty good at it, if for no other reason than Dhianeila is the queen.

I'm trendings towards thinking that Age stayed. For one, Yuty said that they would send Age back to Dhianiela. Second, I doubt Dhianiela would﻿ depart when the rest of humanity wasn't ready to. There's also all the friends she'd be leaving behind. I also doubt Age would make Dhianiela choose between between being with him or leaving everyone/everything behind.
Oh, and if she left her idiot brothers would take over. Dhianiela is much smarter than that. Whatcha think?

So what are you guys making of the ending? It's not officially established if Dhianiela leaves with Age﻿ for the Golden Tribe universe, or if Age stays in this universe with Dhianiela. I dunno.

Rubberduckey111 - that's a very cynical view of things, if you are trying to be a realist about it, thats fine. The most powerful thing we have is imagination....if someone wrote this story and people share in the sentiment then odds are it is in a lot of us.....the ability to create and not be afraid of our emotions is the lesson. It shows we all make mistakes and make hard﻿ choices, they all lead us somewhere. The fact that this is a happy ending doesn't make it unrealistic.

The nerve of youtube to put commercials on﻿ the last episode of such an epic anime. It is the last episode we had enough commercials in the last 25 eps so why the f**k do they have to on this one. I get the point of having to pay FUNimation for the rights to air this but give us a break.
P.S. The owner of FUNimation is going to burn in Hell for his tyrannical way of licensing epic anime in America. At least translate it properly and put more money into the dubs for real voice actors.

amazing anime. the lesson everyone should take from this is to not fear the future. no﻿ matter what decisions we make, good or bad, right or wrong, we should use all of it to build our own path that can lead us to a better brighter future.

you are both right and wrong. the lesson is something someone made up to hook the veiwer and make them say "EPIC SHOW" but no, as i have repeated many times in other anime endings, no one but the﻿ people willing to fully watch the show COULD care about this in real life.
to be honest most people probably prefer a shit hole of a world. look at the movie seven and you will kinda see what I'm talking about.
btw there is also the path of war to peace but this show shows that through the royal idiots.

There're a lot of horrible literature on anime comments, most likely because most people on﻿ the internet doesn't give a crap about grammar.
Also, people tend to type their comment using a talking tone.

Agreed this is one of the best anime out there. However you are mistaken, Funimation didn't make this anime they just licensed it for the﻿ US. The anime studio Xebec made this, the same studio that made Love Hina, Zoids, and Fafner of the Azure just to name a few.

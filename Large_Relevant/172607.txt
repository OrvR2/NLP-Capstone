Why do people love to cry racist at﻿ every turn? This commercial is funny and it's telling you to be happy. If anything it's a compliment to Jamaicans. Why is this even an issue?

LOL! This is funny! I agree BAD ACCENTS ARE WHAT'S OFFENSIVE :) Why not hire REAL Jamaican actors for these roles? I know that there are White Jamaicans, Bob Marley''s father was white. Gabourey Sidibe was a Jamaican in Tower﻿ Heist (Eddie Murphy,﻿ Ben Stiller) Good actress but it didn't work. Even people from other Islands can't trick me when they try to speak Jamaican.Here's a clip but you can't hear enough of her part to understand what I mean. IMDb. com /video/ IMDb/ vi226663961/

The most common technique used by anti-Whites to demoralize White people is to promote a racially brown future, BUT ONLY IN WHITE COUNTRIES.
They﻿ haven't told the Black people in Africa that they have to be blended out of existence.
They haven't told the Asian people that they have to be blended out of existence.
It is ONLY White people that are targeted with this tactic and this agenda - It's genocide - White Genocide.
That's why anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.

Jamaica is a name brand country, so many hype around this country name, its because of﻿ our culture, our patios that we inherit from the British.. like the British accent, patios has its own flava and Jamaica is really tropical and beautiful in real life. with that said jamaica for a island has done things on national lvls ppl are forced to pay attention, from being a favorite destination, to our reggae music the most powerful music with a lot of substance, to our athlete plus many more

Nobody who's black, white, or Jamaican even said this commercial was racist!!! Name one. People really need to stop putting words in black peoples mouths. I didn't even know this commercial existed until today and have no prob with﻿ it. I feel like Volkswagen put out that rumor to get publicity because race always gets people talking. Trust and believe black people and Jamaicans aren't tripping off of this little commercial. Puh-lease!!!

LOL! This is funny! I agree it's not racist. BAD ACCENTS ARE WHAT'S OFFENSIVE :) Why not hire REAL Jamaican actors? I know﻿ that there are White Jamaicans,﻿ Bob Marley''s father was white. Gabourey Sidibe played a Jamaican in Tower Heist (Eddie Murphy,﻿ Ben Stiller.) Good actress but it didn't work. Even people from other Islands can't trick me when they try to speak Jamaican.Here's a clip but you can't hear enough of her part to understand what I mean. IMDb.

Not everyone in America has an issue with it; I lOVE IT!! And I love what it stands for. We all need to chill out a bit and find the joy in life, and Jamaicans do that well. I also liked your point that there are white Jamaicans. We need to stop categorizing people into certain groups and just appreciate each other.﻿

Being a Jamaican, I am proud to see Jimmy Cliff hitting it big with the worldwide audience once again. Americans are very strange. How can they manage to be offended when not one Jamaican is?
The Jamaica Tourist Board markets Jamaica in a similar way, why would people then not want to associate being happy with being Jamaican? With all our problems we still manage to enjoy our selves quite a bit. This ad﻿ is ok, not super innovative or anything but certainly not racist. Not at all. yes im black.

I went to high school in Jamaica ( Womers Boys School ) There are many White Jamaicans ( Chinese too) who speak exactly the way this guy does , it has nothing to do with race. Jamaica is a non-racial society ....maybe﻿ just maybe that is why they are always so damn happy !!!

As a Jamaican living abroad, I smiled the minute I heard the accent, I'm not sure why some people see﻿ this commercial as being racist because Jamaicans aren't all black, we are Asian, White, Black, Brown. Our motto is "Out of many, one people". We may come from different parts of the world, but we are all one people.

Why do they make such a big fuzz about﻿ it? When Mathisyahu sang "One Day" with a Jamaican accent no one complained because it's a good song (and people probably did not realize he is not from Jamaica) I gues now the problem is that it is a good car - not made by Chevrolet - So lalalalonglongdilonglonglong!

Is this racist? It all comes down to whether you trust Volkswagen is joking respectfully and with good will. In this case, I say yes--hilarious, fun, respectful commercial. And great to﻿ see my old classmate Hahn Cho playing the "cloud on a sunny day" guy. Of course, it does perpetuate the stereotype of Jamaicans not sweating the small stuff, but hey--there are worse stereotypes.

Did I say anything about this commercial being offensive? I simply said not all Jamaicans have that positive island vibe.

I thought that, from what you said, you﻿ were inferring that it was offensive. (Some people think it is; I don't know why. :P)

I'm from the Caribbean and I LOVE this ad. It's not racist because Jamaica is a country not a race(note that although I'm from the caribbean and I'm not black), it's funny and it makes people smile. One of the best things about Jamaicans and most caribbean people is we don't take ourselves too seriously anyway. So Chill﻿ all you Winstons

Racism requires a belief that a race is inferior to others. Unfortunately, people cry racism for even the most benign factual statements and portrayals. It is now taboo to speak truthfully about culttural differences (which are not necessarily racial differences) if there is any negative fact or implciation associated﻿ with your observation. And only stand-up comedians are allowed to tell race-based jokes. I am soooo tired of it.

I am giving social criticism! I never said I expected a commercial to be more than dumb shit to make people buy more stuff, like cars in﻿ this case. Like I said, learn to read!

Offensive??﻿ They should have stuck to the standard PC form of ad. In a PC ad it's OK to make fun of men in general,rednecks,and hilbillies. Men might get PO'd but in some people's minds they deserve it. Rednecks and Hillbillies will just laugh about it. Only a very few of them will be offended by the stereotype and those are the older ones who had good manners beat into them by their parents. Shocking fact; not all Hillbillies and Rednecks act like what you see on TV.

Totally agree, man. Even the Jamaican minister of tourism said there's nothing wrong with it. Typically the PC people are never even members of so-called victimized groups.
Should've just avoided all the hassle and "controversy" by putting a white guy in a chicken outfit as a woman﻿ kicks him in the balls and a black guy calls him a honkey-ass racist.
Although, you'd still risk the possibility of stirring the pro-chicken community's outrage at an ad degrading a chicken as a white guy.

God forbid we make Jamaicans look happy, relaxed, and in perspective. You knee-jerk hyper-sensitive types better go protest Red Stripe beer commercials too.
The whole﻿ point was how somebody in a typical uptight office setting was channeling the happy, relaxed culture of Jamaica (through his VW). Stop looking at everything through racial-colored glasses.

To those of you who would make a fuss over﻿ this commercial... really? Come on, get happy- it's not racist- it's not nationalist, there's nothing to throw a tantrum over.

Similarly, it makes zero sense to say something is "just and ad." It's on TV. It portrays a culture. Sticky bun, bad grammar, dreadlocks, weed. Those are Rasta expressions he is using not just a Jamaican accent like a Chinese guy in Jamaica has. The fact that you don't mind, as Jamaicans, having your culture appropriated to sell German cars is fine. Kind of makes sense Volkswagon made the train cars that went﻿ to the death camps. So a big LOL to ya Mon.

You have no idea what you're talking about. You must be African American lol. There are white Jamaicans though blacks are the majority and there are German expat communities in Jamaica. I am Jamaican American, lived in London and one of my closest friends is German and married to a Jamaican. The commercial is a bit of fun. It made me laugh. And, my mother a Phd in Cultural Anthropology who is a member of the Jamaican American Association, was not offended either.﻿ You're being overly sensitive.

I usually dont repsond or comment on Utube, But ur and idiot. There are no Rasta specific expressions in this commerical, I doubt u even know what those are. How many Chinese Jamaicans do you know? I know many!! They speak like any other Jamaican! ﻿ The way a jamaican speaks has far less to do with race and more to do with socio-economic status.

Don't blame the media for the ignorance of these race baiters. If, in 2013, they don't know that someone's ethnicity has nothing to with how they talk, then they need to get out more - or read a book. Or they can start with not projecting their American internal race issues on the﻿ rest of the world...

The clip has a story. The story could be offensive to white people. A white guy buys a VW and it turns him happy. So happy he takes on the personality of a POSITIVE stereotype which shows stuffy white folks, all dour and sad, how smile although its Monday at a boring, failing company. And he wants to spread the good vibes the car has extended to him. The car has transformed him into a positive person. And Jamaicans are among the most positive people. And "THAT IS THE﻿ POWER OF GERMAN ENGINEERING"

I smile every time I see one of those Beetle... Smile because I find funny the idiot that bought that. It's better looking than the last one I give it that, but that's not a Beetle at all. And don't come saying "oh all new models of iconic cars﻿ don't have anything to do with the original" because they're not all like that.

Actually young jamaicans are helping to change the country as far as how our gay﻿ members of society are treated. the prime minister Portia Simpson Miller stated while she was running that the buggery laws do need to be looked at and gay and lesbian jamaicans need better protection by the law. this is the first time a jamaican prime minister has stated support for our LGBT community and many are more willing to go out to protests to fight for their basic human rights.

Yes, ur right...any idiot can have an opinion. And being a Jamaican gives me knowledge that YOU clearly lack.
Let me break it down 4 u (God knows someone﻿ has to): U associate that accent with being black - YOU, sir,﻿ ARE the RACIST. Every German, English, Scottish, Indian, Jewish, Pakistani, Black, Dutch, Irish, Chinese, & Japanese Jamaican (I'm sure I'm forgetting someone) HAS THAT ACCENT. In other words it's not a "black accent" -- IT'S A JAMAICAN ACCENT

The fact that you think there is no such thing as a ghetto black but you don't mind a WASP doing a black accent, actually says more about you. Don't﻿ stress nigga. Put that in a commercial.

patwah is not a black accent or language. my cousins are half chinese half british﻿ half hispanic, some of them have parents born elsewhere and raised in jamaica sadly when they leave to visit the america ppl think they are faking but when they are in the uk it is common knowledge that jamaica has a diverse background and black isn't more jamaican than white. as far as the ad LOVE IT. if this ad shouldn't be on tv neither should cool runnings as it contains americans faking jamaican accents.

I totally agree with about cool running. mighty quinn too. I was more offended by those films than this commercial. Your cousin is a 3CK kid like me and my friends - multinational and cultural. In London most kids speak a little patwah no matter the race. Its kind of the slang there.﻿

1. Jamaican culture is shared and celebrated in this commercial.
2. Point of emphasis was cultural characteristics "Laid back" vs."uptight".﻿
3. why?
4. Yes to focus on the cultural characteristics and not on RACE. Same point would have been made using all ASIANS.
5. Yes go to 4.
6. VW should never joke about cultural differences in a positive light because of ties to Nazi Germany? Maybe Southerners should never talk about black people? Watch the commercial again and follow its advice.

I think you need to lighten up.... It's a commercial. And of all the stereotypical things they could have said about Jamaicans (Perpetual pot heads and poverty come to mind) they chose to go with a brighter side and make it fun and whimsical. They made Jamaicans look like a happy carefree culture. If i were to be portrayed in a stereotypical manner, i'd﻿ want it to be positive, happy, and enjoyable.

In regard to the statement about the sticky﻿ bun. He was advising the guy beating on the machine because his sticky bun was stuck and not coming out that he should relax and be patient. Gravity will soon rectify the problem. So the sticky bun soon fall by itself.
Bredren, mi ah get weh you come from, but seriously its just a tv ad. Nuh tek it so serious. It nah paint Jamaicans in a bad light. It nah call wi lazy. Just sey tek life a likkle easier and stay positive in a stressful situations.

I see nothing offensive in this ad. People are so touchy these days. There so many accents in this world that I love to hear and would love to be able to speak. To say I'm offending the people of that culture by imitating their accent because I find it beautiful IS overstepping your bounds and ignorant of you.﻿

The white guy in the commercial could very well be a JAMAICAN actor because some Jamaicans are white. Get a clue. This ad is﻿ not about RACE. And that is why no black actors are in it. If they had been what would they do? Look at whitey like he is crazy? Talk with an american accent? Then it would have been about race! You just want to see a black face because they are using a Jamaican accent? Thats dumb

How about an ad where a white guy says his L's like R's and vice﻿ versa in an ad for a Chinese restaurant? Hilarious?

Huh??? You have no idea what you're talking about. I'll say it again, you non-Jamaican, Jamaica﻿ is a COUNTRY, not a race.
And by the way, you're analogy is hilarious AND weak, and it shows your ignorance.
We Jamaicans don't need you to feel "offended" on hour behalf. Thanks, but no thanks.

If you mock or celebrate an accent associated﻿ with a culture that is not yours, you are overstepping your bounds. If the guy spoke like a coon from the 1940s, with that accent, people would be outraged. No brains.

He does that accent pretty well, and I liked the part at the end when they have the boss and other guy in the car.
But still, if he was doing that all day and he came up to me and told me to﻿ turn my frown around when I was stressed, I would have punched him in the face or threw something.

It touches on a stereotype of people from a certain region thats lazy and is used over an over again. If we all﻿ had a well rounded view of Jamaicans no one would notice this. But, unfortunately we seem them as childish, apathetic, blunt smokers. Would love to see an example of a Jamaican not shown this way. It's not "racist" as Jamaicans are not a "race", but it's patronizing and ignorant.

I couldn't have said it better myself. People love to press that 'racist' button just a little too quickly nowadays. They should first get a clue first... Lol.
How ironic tho...these misguided people try to 'out' so-called "racism" in this VW commercial and by so doing, they end up revealing their own 'sorta kinda soft bigotry/ignorance'. That is almost as hillarious as﻿ the ad!
Thank you, MPs, for being offended on our (read: Jamaican's) behalf (lol), but it's not necessary or wanted...

listen you idiot.... they didnt just slap on some fake jamaican accent alright. if idiots like you took the time to do research and look up this stuff. When volkwagen got the idea of this and so what they did is﻿ they brought people, whom of which are from jamaica watch this video and they thought it was hilarious also when they brought in a person from jamaica who taught them and made sure they got the accent right.. Lastly there are also white jamaicans so in the end you are wrong...

so if they had used a black NIGERIAN to do this advert with the jamaican accent would you feel as you do now? because as far as i am concerned there would have been no difference. there are white jamaicans so no1 should be having a problem with﻿ the actors skin colour

he actually sounds a lot like my swiss friend who comes to jamaica quite often, because he's a swiss reggae musician and hell bent on﻿ knowing the mother language of his craft by heart.so a German trying out jamaica patois really does sound exactly like this guy (in the ad).it's funny the way his accent gets mangled with pronounciations.still if the intention was to stereotype or to cause mockery. i'd be unhappy.

Hey y'all, this commercial is just friendly.﻿ The Jamaican accent is the most lovely, friendly and sexy accent of all languages in the world. When I heard a Jamaican talks, I just wish I could have that accent. It's stupid to think this is racist. Why be racist about a single country? no reason, man.

i am jamaican and i'm not bother by it,correct me maybe i'm dumb,one part about﻿ being three minutes late actually says we're a nation of late buggers but its true in some part.we're in general a laid back kinda group,that's why polititions screw us over for they see simple mindedness but we refuse to be stressed out all the time so we we go light hearted.plus we don't have snow,being cold for months sucks.what's better than sunshine and a well chilled jelly.

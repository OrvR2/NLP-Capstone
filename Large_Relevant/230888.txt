James Carville Slams Critics Who Question Hillary Clinton’s Illness: ‘Inhumane, Idiotic’ Behavior

Democratic strategist James Carville blasted critics who questioned whether Hillary Clinton was legitimately ill, saying Friday, “I have no idea what it is about the secretary of state that drives them to this kind of inhumane idiotic behaving state.”
Appearing on CNN, Carville told host Wolf Blitzer he simply didn’t “understand” the critics: “What kind of human being is going to think like that with everything going on with concussions, head injuries?”

He said those who questioned the illness were “duly noted” in “Clinton-land.” Most people close to the family, Carville added, “were very, very concerned about the Secretary of State.” Noting that Clinton did testify about Benghazi, which was many critics’ primary concern, Carville said the criticism “doesn’t even make any sense.” 
“It’s just a cheap sound bite if you ask me,” Carville stated.
Clinton was hospitalized for a blood clot following a concussion last month. The illness began with a fall she sustained after a stomach virus zapped her strength. She was released from a New York City hospital earlier this week.

The naked mole rat is right. Hell, his words were too soft. I would have gone a step further and called all those who question her illness ‘stupid ass sons of bitches’. Listening to too much Infowars will rot your brain, folks.

Couldn’t he have just said “GOP behavior”? It’s more succinct and accurate.

Grifter Hillary is a longtime known liar and you would be plumb loco not to question everything that comes out of her mouth.
Serpenthead and the rest of the libs can howl all they want.
They know it’s true.

Dont lecture us on anything. Many of you right wing dopes accused Hillary Clinton of having Vince Foster murdered and I never heard any outrage over those baseless accusations. Carville is completely correct when describing the right wing dopes and their airhead conspiracies

Dead Americans only matter when the president is a Republican.

That’s what Carville said too.






    http://truth-and-opinion.dyndns-blog.com/                            The Peripatetic Apostate



When that Republican president made them dead Americans in countless numbers in the first place, then your statement would be justly true.

How’s the Obama impeachment going on that, considering that the next step is you saying he conspired with the terrorists at Benghazi—certainly an impeachable offense, nicht wahr, Obersturmfuehrer?






wildwood



“Most people close to the family, Carville added, “were very, very concerned about the Secretary of State.” 
Did he say “most people”?  Most?  Not all?  Hum…  Might there be skeptics among their own?
“What kind of human being is going to think like that with everything going on with concussions, head injuries?”
What kind of human beings support, or otherwise feel no empathy or compassion for the unborn child(ren) whose entire head(s) is/are crushed in the process of purposefully killing it/him/her/them?  
The injuries inflicted upon the unborn are much, much, more severe than Clinton’s bump on the noggin, but Dems pay no mind to their terminal sufferings.






wildwood



Umm, you haven’t looked at the numbers of troops killed in Obama’s war in Afghanistan have you?  You’ve also not taken into consideration the FACT that the war with IRAQ was lead by the DEMOCRATS and goes all the way back to the CLINTON administration.  Nice how you Libbies pick and choose among your facts and then twist and turn them to suit your agenda.






wildwood



How do you KNOW there’s no truth behind such speculation?  You don’t.






wildwood



Can you PROVE there was a fall that oh so conveniently happened at just the right time.

Dead Americans don’t count when Obama is president.

Now you’re actually bragging about the double standard.

You have a bad case of historical hysterical revisionism there, right winger, also known as delusional lying.  Next you’ll be blaming Jimmy Carter for the Crucifixion of Christ, the Black Death, the Holocaust, and the existence of the television broadcast called American Idol.

At least Boehner doesn’t have to poke himself in the eye to bring them on, y’know?






wildwood



You have a problem with that statement?






Anonymous



As mentioned above, we were a country of “innocent until proven guilty” before Fox pundits
invented the excuse that, “I don’t have statistics or evidence,
something just seems fishy to me (e.g. unemployment labor statistics.)” Of course you may share the pundits First Principle,
“Where there’s smoke, there’s arson,” unless proven otherwise.

The real problem is to tar and feather somebody we don’t like before verifying a suspicion. Kind of mass hysteria. We are a country of “innocent until proven guilty.” Until now, of course, that Fox pundits have invented the excuse that, “I don’t have statistics or evidence, something just seems fishy to me (e.g. unemployment labor statistics.)” Of course you may share the pundits First Principle:
“Where there’s smoke, there’s arson, unless proven otherwise.”






wildwood



That doesn’t work for me.  I’m not a Fox fan and I’ve worked the streets long enough to know that we have never been a nation of “innocent until proven guilty.”  If that were so, there’d be no arrests prior to adjudication or trial.  But of course, one has only to be suspect to be placed under arrest.  Our prisons are full of souls who hadn’t the means to prove their innocence.
Where there’s smoke, there isn’t always arson.
But what I find fishy is the fact that Hillary can hardly breathe without the MSM publicizing it, so it just seems to me that had there been such a horrific fall the MSM would have been all over it like white on rice long before it was.
Lights, cameras, mics, reporters with their live – on the spot reports – and all that, aside from the lights and the sirens and the housekeepers eye witness account….  You get my drift.

FOUR AMERICANS WERE MURDERED AND NOBODY WANT TO KNOW WHY, IF I WERE SEC. OF STATE I WOULD HAVE COME OUT OF MY GRAVE TO TESTIFY.






Mari Johnson



If you had added “insanely jealous” I could whole totally agree with you.  Ever notice the RW nut jobs give out hate speech against the person they are most jealous of.  Their concerted to wreck Hillary’s career is just insane.  I am a moderate Republican but I have never seen such as deranged syndrome in our Party before.  She must be supper efficient and successful.  These dolts completely forget we are the party of Lincoln.






Mari Johnson



Actually, her blood clot pretty much proves she fall.  But I never expect rational thought out of Hillary naysayers!






wildwood



Naysayers, or realists?  How about you?  Gullible, much?   Do you believe everything this administration tells you, in spite of the countless lies and misrepresentations?  If so, silly you.  
As for the blood clot proving the fall – not really.






Anonymous



Yes, my worries are more about public opinion drift than Hillary. Now that PC has detoured actual intent to mean whatever offends someone, I worry about other casual acceptances of unsubstantiated opinion. Even when things don’t always work in practice, such as bias in arresting (and that only means “stop” not “convict”) suspects, we have a common understanding of things like “innocent until proven guilty.” After Jack Welch tweeted “Can’t debate so change the numbers,” he was interviewed saying he had no statistics, but it felt fishy. Then Allen West agreed with him. These are people who influence others, and any additional media-supported instances are worrisome. But, now let me comment on your response as one of the best examples of “civil discourse” in a long time. Keep it up and other posters will be acting rational.

If we want to know why in order to prevent death in the future, that is a positive use of tax-payer money into investigation. If we are looking for a person to blame or score political points, when there are a million other hotspots all over the globe, then that is a negative use of taxpayer money.






Mari Johnson



Oh yes, our guy invaded a country that did not send the perps and put off invading the country that did.  He did finally get around to getting to the correct country but he still kept his war going in Iraq,  Tried to outdo his daddy but failed miserably,  Plus US debt for as far as the eye could see.  This hate speech seems mighty suspiciously partisan and/or racist to me.

Criticizing the president is hate speech except when he’s a Republican. Oh, and it’s racist except when it’s not.

CENTENNIAL, Colo.--Flags outside the Arapahoe County Detention Facility flew at half-staff Saturday for the victims killed and wounded in the Aurora movie theater massacre.
Beyond the jail's walls sits the man police say is responsible for the rampage, one of the worst mass shootings in United States history.
"The inmates know he's in there, but nobody's saying anything," said a woman leaving from visiting a jailed relative. "I wonder if he's on suicide watch. He should be."
Late Saturday, authorities confirmed suspect James Holmes is being held in solitary confinement.
"We typically do this in high-profile cases," Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson told Reuters. "It has nothing to do with any specific threat."

Victims, families struggle with emotions toward Colorado theater gunmanBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Sat, Jul 21, 2012Tweet0

AURORA, Colo.--Denver shooting victim Marcus Weaver wants to show mercy to the man who put two shotgun pellets in his right shoulder, but admits it's a struggle.
"I'm a man of faith, but it gets tried in times like this," Weaver told Yahoo News. "I'm not saying I'm forgiving him today, I'm not saying I'm not mad, but at some point I'm going to have to let it go."
Weaver, 41, was one of 70 people killed or injured by alleged gunman James Holmes in a suburban Denver movie theater. Twelve of the victims died. Two remained in critical condition Saturday morning.
"It was just senseless," said Weaver, still clutching the bloody T-shirt he was wearing when shot.
Weaver was with friends in the fifth row of the dark theater. They were about 15 minutes into the action-packed Batman "The Dark Knight Rises" when Holmes came in a side exit door carrying three guns, including a military-style rifle capable of shooting 50 to 60 rounds per minute.

The gunman was clad head-to-toe in black riot gear, the kind used to protect SWAT officers. Weaver said he never saw the assailant's face, just his dark silhouette lit up by the flashes of gunfire.
"You could hear little kids screaming, people crying," Weaver said, recalling the wide spray of bullets. "He would shoot all the way across. He would shoot people trying to exit."
Weaver said his heart breaks recalling the chaos outside the cinema.
"There was a girl from my old church who was giving CPR to another 13-year-old girl," he said.

AURORA, Colo.--The gunman who blasted his way through a packed movie house early on Friday, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others, had apparently been planning his attack for weeks.
"In the last 60 days, he purchased four guns at local metro gun shops and through the Internet he purchased over 6,000 rounds of ammunition," Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates said Friday night.
The suspect, 24-year-old former medical student James Holmes, had also been stockpiling magazines to carry the gun ammunition. One clip recovered at the scene could hold 100 rounds for his military-style rifle.

"As far as we know, it was a pretty rapid pace of fire in that theater," said Chief Oates, noting that all the weapons purchases were legal.
Police are trying to learn more about the man's motives but have thus far been unable to access his booby-trapped apartment near the Colorado medical school where he recently withdrew from classes.
Investigators have described the apartment as being filled with chemicals, trip wires, jars of ammunition and possible mortar rounds.

Generosity greatly changes fortunes of bullied bus monitorBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Fri, Jul 20, 2012Tweet0

Life hasn't always been kind to Karen Klein.

She was a widow at 51.
She lost her son, Rusty, to suicide 10 years ago.
She had to take out a loan against her paid-off home to make ends meet.
Health problems have limited her hearing and, sometimes, her ability to walk.

Then, last month, a video of the school bus monitor being badgered by four seventh-graders went viral.  For 10 minutes, the foul-mouthed boys peppered her with insults about her weight, hearing aids, economic status and worse.
"You don't have a family because they all killed themselves because they didn't want to be near you," one of the bullies said.
It's no wonder the 68-year-old still has a tough time accepting that thousands of good Samaritans are about to change her life forever.
"I didn't realize there were so many nice people out there in the world," Klein, who lives in upstate New York, told Yahoo News this week.
That's because a stranger's online campaign to fund a vacation for Klein also went viral. Instead of

Witnesses: Chaos and confusion inside the Colorado movie theater shootingBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Fri, Jul 20, 2012Tweet0


[Updated at 1:30 p.m. EDT]
Moviegoer Jennifer Seeger was watching the new Batman movie from the second row when the gunman, wearing what appeared to be a gas mask and body armor, burst into theater 9.
"He came in and he threw in the gas can and then I knew it was real," Seeger told NBC News. "Then he shot the ceiling. Right after he shot the ceiling he pointed the gun right at me. At that point I drove into the aisle and I got lucky because he didn't shoot me.

"Then he started to shoot people behind me and the bullets were falling on my head. It was burning my head it was so fresh. I could smell gunpowder. At that point he went up the stairs.
"He started at the very corner of the screen. And then he worked his way all the way through the back and back down. Like all the way to the top of the stairs and back down."

Trayvon Martin’s parents reject George Zimmerman’s apologyBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Thu, Jul 19, 2012Tweet0

The parents of Trayvon Martin say they have a hard time accepting George Zimmerman's nationally televised apology.
Last night, in his first interview since killing the unarmed 17-year-old, the former neighborhood watch volunteer said the shooting death must have been part of "God's plan" and that he prays for the Martin family daily.
"I simply really don't know what God George Zimmerman is worshipping because there's no way that the God that I serve had in his plans for George Zimmerman to murder my son," Tracy Martin, the teen's dad told CBS News.
Zimmerman, a licensed gun carrier in Florida, shot and killed Martin in February during a confrontation in the gated neighborhood where Zimmerman lived and Martin was visiting a family friend. Zimmerman said he thought Martin looked suspicious and was following him so he could give police his whereabouts.

Ousted Boy Scouts leader won’t give up gay rights fightBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Wed, Jul 18, 2012Tweet0

IRVING, Texas—Booted from being a den leader three months ago, a lesbian mother on Wednesday brought her fight to the Boy Scouts of America's backyard.
Flanked by her partner and two young sons, Jennifer Tyrrell of Ohio delivered a massive petition to the youth organization's national headquarters. More than 300,000 signatures she collected call for the group to reinstate her and end its controversial policy prohibiting gay Scouts and troop leaders.
"It's insane and needs to change," said Tyrrell, who at times became tearful. "It's sad."
The Boy Scouts welcomed Tyrrell into their Texas offices but gave her no answers as to why a secret committee recently decided to reaffirm the organization's long-standing rule of excluding gays.
"I don't know how this 11-member committee can decide that 300,000 Americans don't matter, that their opinions don't matter," Tyrrell said after her 15-minute meeting with a Scouts spokesman and another unidentified official.
While it wasn't forthcoming, the

FBI interviews, other evidence released in George Zimmerman murder caseBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Thu, Jul 12, 2012Tweet0
&lt;br /&gt; 
[Updated at 4 p.m. EST]
The FBI interviewed dozens of people after George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin, but none mentioned thinking the killing was racially motivated, according to evidence released on Thursday.
Hundreds of pages of documents, including FBI interviews with Zimmerman's friends, co-workers and neighbors, were made public Thursday in the Florida murder case against the now-infamous neighborhood watch volunteer.

Zimmerman fatally shot Martin, an unarmed black 17-year-old, in late February. Zimmerman, 28, maintains he feared for his life and shot Martin in self-defense under Florida's "stand your ground law." Sanford, Fla. police did not immediately charge Zimmerman, prompting protests and demands for a federal civil rights investigation.
In addition to those close to Zimmerman, the FBI also questioned Sanford detectives working the case, including lead

Manhunt for Georgia money manager accused of embezzling millionsBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Mon, Jul 9, 2012Tweet0

Did Georgia money manager Aubrey Lee Price commit suicide in shame or skip town with $17 million?
According to the FBI, the 46-year-old disappeared in mid-June "after telling acquaintances that he had lost a large amount of money through trading activities and that he planned to kill himself."
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that Price told some people he planned to jump to his death off a ferry. The FBI says he was last seen boarding a ferry boat in Key West bound for Fort Myers on June 16. A Coast Guard search has not turned up a body.
Last week, the Department of Justice charged Price with embezzling millions from a small southern Georgia bank he took over in December 2010.
"The complaint alleges that, instead of investing the money as promised, Price fraudulently wired the bank's funds to accounts that he personally controlled at other financial institutions and provided bank management with altered documents to make it appear as if he had invested the bank's money in

Heat wave prompts concerns about Freon shortage, home cooling costsBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo!Staff WriterPostsEmailBy Jason Sickles, Yahoo! | The Lookout – Fri, Jun 29, 2012Tweet0

Mother Nature is showing Atlanta no mercy. Friday's forecast high?  105. Followed by 105, then 104.
Atlanta homeowner Lee Becknell's air conditioner was kaput until a technician arrived a few days ago.
"AC just needed new Freon and does not need to be replaced. Phew." Becknell wrote in a tweet.
Well worth the $250 repair cost, she said.
"Yeah, it would have been awful if it wasn't working this weekend," Becknell told Yahoo News.
She likely got lucky on the service tab too. Across the country, air conditioner repair companies are sounding the alarm about skyrocketing maintenance costs.
"There are some big changes going on in the world of air conditioning," warns Davis Air Conditioning in Lawton, Okla.
[Related: Heat wave sweeps across U.S.]
"Air conditioning Freon prices have more than tripled since last year," Alexander Heating and Air Conditioning near Raleigh, N.C., writes on its website.
Not good news given that temperatures in the South, Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic could reach or

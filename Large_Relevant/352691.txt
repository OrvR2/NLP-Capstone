5daysagoEgyptian president imposes state of emergency in 3 cities after deadly clashesA day after 37 people were killed in protests, chaos erupted among the thousands who walked to mourn them. Meanwhile, President Morsi declared a state of emergency. NBC's Ayman Moyeldin reports. Follow @NBCNewsWorld

By Edmund Blair and Yasmine Saleh, ReutersCAIRO - Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi declared a month-long state  of emergency on Sunday in three cities along the Suez Canal which have been the  focus of anti-government violence that has killed dozens of people over the past  four days.
 Seven people were shot dead and hundreds were injured in Port  Said on Sunday during the funerals of 33 protesters killed at the weekend. A  total of 49 people have been killed in demonstrations around the country since  Thursday and Morsi's opponents have called for more protests on Monday. 
"Down, down Morsi, down down the regime that killed and tortured us!" people  in Port Said chanted as the coffins of those killed on Saturday were carried  through the streets.

 In a televised address, Morsi said a nightly curfew  would be introduced in Port Said, Ismailia and Suez, starting Monday evening. He  also called for dialogue with top politicians. About 200 people protested in  Ismailia after the announcement."The protection of the nation is the  responsibility of everyone. We will confront any threat to its security with  force and firmness within the remit of the law," the president said, adding that  he offered condolences to families of the victims of those who died in the  cities.In Cairo the newly appointed interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim  was ejected from the funeral of one of the police officers who died during  Saturday's clashes in Port Said, according to witnesses and police sources.

A police officer at the funeral said many of his colleagues blame the interior  minister on the deaths of at least two policemen during Saturday's clashes as he  did not allow the police there to carry weapons and were only given teargas  bombs.
 State television said seven people died from gunshot wounds on  Sunday. Port Said's head of hospitals, Abdel Rahman Farag, told Reuters more  than 400 people had suffered from teargas inhalation, while 38 were wounded by  gunshots.Gunshots had killed many of the 33 who died on Saturday when  residents went on the rampage after a court sentenced 21 people, mostly from the  Mediterranean port, to death for their role in deadly soccer violence at a  stadium there last year.A military source said many people in Port  Said, which lies next to the increasingly lawless Sinai Peninsula, possess guns  because they do not trust the authorities to protect them. However it was not  clear who was behind the deaths and injuries.In Cairo, police fired  teargas at dozens at protesters throwing stones and petrol bombs in a fourth day  of clashes over what demonstrators there and in other cities say is a power grab  by Islamists two years after Hosni Mubarak was overthrown.In Ismaila  city, which lies on the Suez Canal between the cities of Suez and Port Said,  police also fired teargas at protesters attacking a police station with petrol  bombs and stones, according to witnesses and a security source there.The protesters accuse Morsi, elected in June with the support of his  Muslim Brotherhood group, of betraying the democratic goals of the revolution.  Most of the deaths since Thursday were in Port Said and Suez, both cities where  the army has now been deployed.The violence adds to the daunting task  facing Morsi as he tries to fix a beleaguered economy and cool tempers before a  parliamentary election expected in the next few months which is supposed to  cement Egypt's transition to democracy.Deep riftIt has exposed a deep rift in  the nation. Liberals and other opponents accuse Morsi of failing to deliver on  economic promises and say he has not lived up to pledges to represent all  Egyptians. His backers say the opposition is seeking to topple Egypt's first  freely elected leader by undemocratic means.

Heba Morayef of Human  Rights Watch in Cairo said a state of emergency reintroduced laws that gave  police sweeping powers of arrest "purely because (people) look suspicious"."It is a classic knee jerk reaction to think the emergency law will help  bring security," she said. "It gives so much discretion to the Ministry of  Interior that it ends up causing more abuse which in turn causes more anger."The opposition Popular Current and other groups have called for more  protests on Monday to mark what was one of the bloodiest days of the 2011  uprising.On a bridge close to Tahrir  Square, youths hurled stones at police in riot gear who fired teargas to push  them back towards the square, the cauldron of the uprising that erupted on  January 25, 2011 and toppled Mubarak 18 days later. "None of the  revolution's goals have been realized," said Mohamed Sami, a protester in  Cairo's Tahrir Square on Sunday."Prices are going up. The blood of  Egyptians is being spilt in the streets because of neglect and corruption and  because the Muslim Brotherhood is ruling Egypt for their own interests."Clashes also erupted in other streets near the square. The U.S. and  British embassies, both close to Tahrir, said they were closed for public  business on Sunday, normally a working day.The army, Egypt's interim  ruler until Morsi's election, was sent back onto the streets to restore order in  Port Said and Suez, which both lie on the Suez canal. In Suez, at least eight  people were killed in clashes with police.Many ordinary Egyptians are  frustrated by the violence that have hurt the economy and their livelihoods."They are not revolutionaries protesting," said taxi driver Kamal  Hassan, 30, referring to those gathered in Tahrir. "They are thugs destroying  the country."Call for dialogueThe National Defence Council,  headed by Morsi, called on Saturday for national dialogue to discuss political  differences.That offer has been cautiously welcomed by the opposition  National Salvation Front. But the coalition has demanded a clear agenda and  guarantees that any agreements will be implemented.The Front, formed  late last year when Morsi provoked protests and violence by expanding his powers  and driving through an Islamist-tinged constitution, has threatened to boycott  the parliamentary poll and call for more protests if its demands are not met,  including for an early presidential vote.Egypt's transition has been  blighted from the outset by political rows and turbulence on the streets that  have driven investors out and kept many tourists away. Its currency, the pound,  has steadily weakened against the dollar.

We represent hope for them. Your wife would be AMAZED at how respectful the people are of women. Please tell your wife not to listen to the news. I live here!! Egypt is safe. I know this might sound unbelievable to many people but I actually feel safer here than I do in the U.S. (I am from the San Diego area) It would be my pleasure and honor to show you and your wife this beautiful country, some of her archeological sites that are only open to scholars, and maybe cruise the Nile. There are many, MANY of us (Professors, teachers, Archeologists, etc) who are here, working, and enjoying our lives. It is a magical time here, for direct democracy is in play. and, as with any place a person just needs to avoid certain areas. Cairo is 8 times the size of L.A. Even though my flat is in Cairo (Heliopolis is a suburb of Cairo) I am well over 2 hours away from Tahrir Square.
Do not be afraid. Come and enjoy the Pyramids, Saqqara, Valley of the Kings, and a very special Valley of the Artisans. You will go back to the U.S. a much different and better person.  In kind regards.#35.2 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:25 PM ESTJ.A-522495Sorry, no, I will not be visiting Egypt. Americans have been chased from there and it is not the same place that it was a few yrs ago. People from many parts of the world lived and worked there...but the radicals no longer want that...It is not safe and probably will not be safe for many years.#35.3 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:35 PM ESTdrjillI can understand how you would not want to come here. However, your statement about Americans being chased away is incorrect. And we can agree to disagree for I am here and feel safe. I know people think this is an insane comment and feeling, but I actually feel safer here than I do in many parts of the U.S. The Copts, Liberal, and Secularists outnumber the Extremists, they are just trying to get organized. H. H. pope Tadros and the liberal Sheik of the Grand Mosque are working together to help matters. Unfortunately they do not get the press/media coverage. The Egyptian people miss the friendliness of the Americans and our open-mindedness. There are many of us here, doing what we do and continuing the work we have all been doing. It is my hope that people will view Egypt the way we do here in the country and choose to help the Egyptian people. We have much more in common that the people here in these pages realize. It is sad that they do not connect to their history.   In kind regards.#35.4 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 6:55 PM ESTJ.A-522495I just did a computer search using the words Egypt foreign workers and up popped info upon info about how the new gov of Egypt were expelling foreign workers and arresting and putting on trial many others. Apparently NGO workers (Non government organizations) were the target of the new radicals. .....Sorry, you dont want us....then we will not be tourists...nor will we risk your country being safe with all the radical elements that are now there.  Egypt with its history would have been one of the areas that I would liked to have visited....but, I know better.#35.5 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 7:20 PM ESTdrjillThe NGO's had been being investigated for a few years. Some of them are fine and some of them were bringing in younger people (interns they called them) under visas that were incorrect. During former Pres. Mubarak's term they were beginning the investigations. Most of them were expelled last year. Some of the younger people have come back or the organizations who are still here have cleaned up their visas. Some of the hotels and marketing or translation businesses have been doing that too, bringing in people under incorrect visas. But, in all fairness to them, the visa process is (at best) confusing, and at worst expensive. For example, a tourist visas is only about 25.00 USD whereas an educational visa can run upwards of 100.00 or more USD depending on the school and status of the professors. From what I understand the NGO's would bring in the younger people on an educational visa which is cheaper than a media or other educational visas. It is a complicated process and one I have to confess I hate to deal with. There is a large American staff at the AUC (American University of Cairo) and Chicago University. There are other schools, too, who have their ducks in a row (so to speak). St. Fatima and the Language schools are really good at the visa process. I suppose nothing is ever perfect....nor I would not want to twist someone's arm to come. but, the people here in tourism are mostly the Copts and liberals. They are of course concerned with the political situation, but then they are being harmed by Americans not coming over. The British come as tourists and even the Canadians come, but the Americans stay away. We saw a rather large tour group who were French the other day. So the Copts, other Christians, liberals, and secularists are getting hit from both ends. Hopefully you will feel more comfortable one day to come and then you will be able to see for yourself. I had friends come and stay with me over a break. They loved it because there were very few lines, the people were gracious, and they could stay and pray in many of the areas where the crowds usually are. Further, even though the Egyptian Museum is off of Tahrir Square as long as a person does not go there Thursday, Friday, or Saturday things are pretty settled and quiet. This last week the protestors began to come to the square about Tuesday or so, so traffic was a pain. But I had a friend (Copt Christian female) who was down at the square on Thursday and said she had no problems.
Again, I guess time will tell. Some new sites have even been opened such as the Serapium out at Saqqara. It is an AWESOME tomb where the ancient Egyptians mummified the bulls and put them in Sarcophagi. It is an amazing place. My area of expertise is in the Valley of the Artisans. This is the small valley (wadi) between the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens. It is the village of the workers/artisans who did the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. There are only two real tombs, here but they are simply gorgeous and the colors are pristine. Anyway, I apologize for could ramble on about them. It is peaceful there and quiet. I hope you get to see it and the other special places that make Egypt such a wonderful and magical place.  Take it from someone who lives and works here, you are missed.
Take care.  In kind regards.#35.6 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 7:55 PM EST

DaveyJonesDetroitWell, so much for the Arab Spring, and our support of it.  At least our U.S. Air Force got some planning, targeting, and bombing practice in Libya out of it.  Another foreign policy victory for the Administration, and for George Soros' Open Society Institute, whose tax-exempt 501 (c) (3) "grass roots" organizations very likely coordinated and twitter-initiated the well-covered, well-coordinated, well-propagandized uprisings.  Anyone remember the burka-clad woman speaking directly into the camera in near-perfect English saying how excited she was?  I'm sure she spoke for the bulk of women who look forward to a life of chattel slavery, only to pass it along to their daughters, under Sharia Law.  Wait, maybe that would work for American women as well...

Amendment I

Gotta love the Jewish people. 
Do you think they care two @!$%#s about Swedish/German Americans? Maybe this could be a new "block" in Congress.1 vote#42.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 5:57 PM ESTDaveyJonesDetroitJohnny, as a fellow Goyim, I can't speak for the Jewish people, but I think that they, like the rest of us, are trying to sort out who they are as Americans and as citizens of the world.
Peter Beinart, in his book "The Crisis of Zionism" [New York:  Times Books, 2012] lamented the identity crisis of American Jewry as well as that of Israel, especially for young people.  He states the ethics and politics of recovering from the horrors of the Holocaust are very different from the position of power they hold in American society today.
Norman Podhoretz, in his book "Why are Jews Liberals?" [New York: Vintage Books, 2010] noted that Karl Marx was briefly a Jewish convert to Christianity before he fell under the influence of Hegel and the Frankfurt School where he became an atheist.  His new political philosphy became the rage (?opiate?) of the Intellectual Class 150 years ago, and the 20th Century documented the horrors which followed.  The White House communications director who called Mao her "favorite political philosopher" either overlooked, buried, or rationalized Mao's butchering of 60-85 MILLION of his own people under his variant Marx's philosophy.
So, do the Jews care about the rest us?  I can only believe they do.  Ones I have met and worked with have been some of the most patriotic, giving and altruistic people I've had the privilege to know.  American Jewry, along with the rest of American society, needs to sort out which Jewish Messiah it desires to follow--Karl Marx or Y'shua (Jesus Christ).  I do hope their final choice was not reflected in the most recent election.  I sincerely hope America returns to Jesus, rather than stumbling the rest of they way down the slippery and treacherous slope to Marx, Mao, Stalin, Che, Pol Pot, and the other Butchers of the 20th Century, including Hitler whose party was called National Socialist German Workers' Party (German:  Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, abbreviated NSDAP) [Wikipedia].
Our children and their children will live with the result of our choice...1 vote#42.2 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 6:51 PM EST

In such a system, checks are put on the powers of govenment, especially the executive, and the rights of individuals and minorities (such as religious minorities) are guaranteed.

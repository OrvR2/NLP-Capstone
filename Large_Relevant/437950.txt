I want to clarify something here. This ad was not meant to offend anybody. If so they are sorry. This ad is meant to show movies from the past. So please calm down. I can see how you might think this﻿ as racist but it is not. Sincerely, an calm American.

Just wanted to clarify something that seems to be causing confusion. Coca-Cola is not the﻿ United States. It is a company that operates within the US. People seem to be grouping them as the same thing for some strange reason.

That is very racist ad and offensive﻿ for millions of Arab who will not like cola any more
coca cola saying that there is another ending where the Arabic man drink the coke but that is not what the 100 millions american will see
also why the Arabic man not included in the vote?
it is very stupid ad

Oh I'm sorry, Arabs don't live in the Middle East deserts and camels are definitely not from that part of the world either. There's definitely no such thing as desert nomads travelling around in the desert either. Coke must be making all this up, sue Coke for spreading these falsifications. Damn them for spreading these﻿ lies!

I feel like you are not Arab American and just trying to talk Arab Americans down. First off, this video doesn't show in any way that the Arab is being incompetent, only that camels are stubborn. Second, you say that the owner is a Jew, but there really isn't an owner as it is a publicly traded company and the CEO is Muslim. Third, this video is just another take on some of those random scenes you see at baseball games where﻿ you trying to get which version of coke is going to win the race.

Seriously guys come on... it's not Coca-Cola's fault that the dudes camel wasn't thirsty and didn't feel like moving. Everyone needs to stop being so emotional and sensitive about things. It's a commercial! And think about it, what good would come﻿ for coca-cola to have a racist commercial? It would do nothing but hurt their earnings so no, this commercial isn't racist, just advertises a good drink and a stubborn camel hahaha

Did I say that I said the guy was Muslim or Arab??? NO, pay attention for once. I just don't﻿ understand why people are getting angry. Is that too much to comprehend?

Lame argument. Not saying your story is fabricated. It's just a really really weak argument. The man on here is wearing traditional Arab clothing. He's in a desert, with his camel. Even has Middle Eastern﻿ features. It perfectly fits the stereotype. Its pretty safe to assume their projecting an Arab.

Ridiculous to feel offended by this. To call this racist. Bunch of clowns. You know, I am Dutch.What do Dutch people wear according to people who know nothing about Holland? We wear wooden shoes/clogs. If there was a group of clog wearing farmers in this video,NOBODY would﻿ feel like saying it is racist. Many dessert people use camels, so why not show it? And in that pink bus were also some 'none white' people, do you hear them complain being portrait as an erotic dancer? STOP PLAYING DAMN VICTIM

The most common technique used by anti-Whites to demoralize White people is to promote a﻿ racially brown future, BUT ONLY IN WHITE COUNTRIES.
They haven't told the Black people in Africa that they have to be blended out of existence.
They haven't told the Asian people that they have to be blended out of existence.
It is ONLY White people that are targeted with this tactic and this agenda - It's genocide - White Genocide.
That's why anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.

For your information people, Allah is the general name for God in Arabic.
It is used by 20 million Christian Arabs﻿ to describe God, in the name Allah.
Allah is not a specific name in Arabic, it is used for naming any Gods.
So stop cursing and being racist!

The Coca-Cola Company is not trying to offend anyone. The company is merely trying to catch the viewers' eyes and put emphasis on the fact that Coca-Cola is a thirst quencher, or at least is being marketed as such. The target market has a tendency to associate deserts, camels, Cowboys, Badlanders, and the Middle﻿ East with dryness and thirst. Such associations are vital to advertising and are not meant as offensive.

It would﻿ not shock me if it was only 3/4 of a mile the way the crow flies and 50 miles the way the road goes, and the Arab knows that since it's the desert he knows and keeps on trucking. The others arrive and he say can I buy the world a coke? What ever. The Arab is not in the running to win but who knows.

For the people wondering where the music from...
The initial violin solo is﻿ the main theme of a piece called "Scheherazade" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.
After that, the fast-tempo piece is called "Danse Bacchanale" from an opera called "Samson and Delilah" by Camille Saint-Saens.

The Arab man wins of course! Except he ditches the camel & get's an Arabian horse. Rides it with his captivating sexy body, wiping the sweat off his strong manly face. He wins & still has time to smoke some sisha while he writes me a post card to tell me﻿ about his adventures & how he misses making passionate love to me. He than bathes his magestic body, has dinner & sets up shop to wait for all the other biatches when the arrive... ha ha ha ... I'm a Hispanic woman who Loves Arabs YUMMY...

It's racist because not all white people in the desert look like they're from Mad Max, the sheriff is black (worked in Blazing Saddles) and why is Katy Perry is driving the﻿ bus? Other than that, fully commercial.

I'm Arab. HOWEVER, I don't think this Ad is﻿ racist. I mean, the Arab guy was clearly not included in the race. Even if he was, how the hell is he gonna win with that Camel. It's obvious that the camel is too slow. I mean it's all logic people. Say he's in the race, how the hell is he gonna win? By walking, he'll lose. Riding the camel, he'll lose. This ad is definitely not racist. Just because he wasn't in the race, doesn't make it racist.
Thumbs up so everyone can see and enjoy the ad!!

Okay, so i am kinda just throwing my opinion into a storm of opinions, but seriously? racism? hardly. The 3 included in the voting were racing for the coke. the Arab man﻿ just happen to be there. Therefore, he is not included in the voting. As far as i am concerned it is simple as that.

I am arab and I see no racism here. Just because their is an arab guy here, doesn't mean its racism!.
As for UAE,Qatar,Kuwit,Saudi,Bahrin are rich countries.
Only Egypt,Syria and Jordon and Libya and Iraq are poor countries.
And being poor does not mean its actually shame,
Its a problem because you can't feed your children.
Which make us petty on them and not say shame on you.
Their is a lot of rich arab countries and their are poor﻿ ones as well.
And defiantly no one is living at the sand.

First off UAE is NOT all Arabia, most people make this mistake. As a matter of fact their are about 300 hundred million Arabs in the world give or take a few. 7 million of those Arabs live in the UAE
Out of those 300 something million Arabs about 1/2 live below the poverty﻿ level and about 1/4 are illiterate.
So don't be confused by a few shinny buildings.

I don't know what they are whining about, the horses are likely to give out, and the camels﻿ are likely to make it the extra 50 miles. Give it a rest already! It is not racist to lose a race. Get real. Arabs use both horses and camels, and camels move slowly. Camels are what you take out in the desert because they have more endurance there than horses. No all Arabs are cry babies but the ones crying about this are!

I think you are right and the real complaint should be that they used two parodies from Australia, a nation that does not make many movies. Very bias if you ask me. But no some people just think everything is about them.﻿ It's anti Arab because they picked a camel to use with an Arab the very same thing an Arab would take out in the desert, and something many are proud of. CRY BABIES WILL WHINE NO MATER WHAT!

This isn't racist its stupid, they all end up breaking down and being stopped, if the arabs the first because his camel doesn't want to go, how does that make it racist, its in a desert so﻿ I guess theres a chance of it being in a middle eastern country/Africa which they usually have main transportation through the desert (which are camels)

Americans defending this ad based on "there is﻿ no racism" are idiots. This ad is playing on stereotypes (that's the problem).
Stop it with the strawman fallacy. Most critics are not claiming it's racist. The problem is stereotypes.
Americans are not smart enough to handle stereotypes. Their stupidity will lead to racism.

thats a fair point. the reason the arab american groups are mad is because they believed coke was basically calling them camel jockeys. i don't view it as﻿ racist (except for not letting people vote for the arab guy). i must admit though i do sympathize with those groups. im an arab american and muslim and i have been called some very racist things, one day it was extremely hot and i was wearing a keffiyeh and someone called me a towel head, so i could understand if they were alittle sensitive

I still can't figure out why most Arabs think they can force the complete Muslim world to submit to their will myself. No kidding. As far as we goes, you can never speak for all Arabs or Muslims any more than I can speak for a complete group of humans. The really funny thing is the Arab I dated likes Diet Coke. Most﻿ Arabs are good people and I know that, but you simply can't speak for all of them. You are still very young my friend.

Well in my America you have that choice. I myself have a problem with them not having the Arab on the list of possible winners of the race. The horses could pass out do to lack of water, the MadMax lot could do stupid things and get killed off, and the dizzy queens could overheat the bus just like in the movie Pricilla Queen Of The Desert. The Arab could win because he picked the right mode﻿ of transport to go across the desert road or no road.

 i don't know y they don't let people vote for him either. it would be funny if all three end up finding out its just a mirage and the arab just goes to a town and﻿ buys a coke from a machine. ive always wanted to go to texas. it looks like a nice city. for some reason i always liked texan sports teams. except for the houston rockets who stole omar asik from the bulls (stacy king had like 6 nicknames for him).

Houston has a large Muslim population incase you did not know. Like every place else we have both good and bad. We have the 2nd highest population in the USA too. I can't think Coke did not have a way to save face after putting the Arabs in the video and not allowing people﻿ to vote for them. You sound like a good young man, and I wish you all the luck in the world.

its racist because if you try to vote on who's winning , there wont be that arabian guy , all of the cowboys, showgirls and badlanders are there except the arabian. i dont expect you americans to understand that cus even if its﻿ a small thing like this, it still proves the discrimination that arabs go through throughout the world everyday. i dont think its that much of a deal but its these small things that make the difference after all.

the music opens with main theme of Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherazade" and then transitions quickly into bits from the Bacchanale in Camille Saint-Saens' "Samson﻿ and Delilah". great job with the music choices, coke! :-)

As a post-apocalyptic motorcycle riding warrior nomad, this add disturbs me. We warrior nomads do a lot of good for the world, but we are so busy raiding settlements looking for gasoline and﻿ breeding stock we would never have time to go around chasing after a giant bottle of soda.

There's no doubt in my mind that Coca Cola will show the Arab winning the race. None of the others have any experience or the equipment to go down 50 miles in the desert. The horses will die,﻿ the cycles and the bus will run out of gas, etc. Coca Cola is not so dumb so as to make a commercial which might be interpreted as racist or xenophobic.

Bit of an oversight to﻿ not include the camel rider but it's a stretch to call it racist.

The Arabs are mad because they are portrayed as having lesser technology and are struggling to keep up while the other Western people seem to have better technology and are further ahead in the race.
I wouldn't call it racist as it doesn't seem too far fetched from the truth to me. Maybe if the﻿ "good" arabs stood up for themselves against the Jihad crazies, they wouldn't be living in the stone age anymore.

Lesser technology ? Race?
You're an absolute moron. There is no race, End of the world 2012 is a myth.
It's funny when morons like you use the term stone age when they have no idea what that means. Living in caves is the stone age. Living in cities with latest technology isn't.
Look at Dubai and think twice before you get﻿ corrected like you just did.

Um, no I didn't you inept moron. If I removed my own comment, there would be something that says: "Comment removed, author withheld." If the comment simply disappears, it's either﻿ the original poster (cocacola) that removed it, or a glitch. Keep looking stupid, buddy. You're doing good!

"there would be something that says"
And that's why Neanderthals like you are inferior.
I didn't reply to your "removed comment". That's the point moron. Someone else did and when you click "show", it gives that exact message you just mentioned.
Don't try to hid it. You removed your own after 2 neurons made a connection for the first time ! Congrats for finally having a 2 digit IQ. How does﻿ that feel ? :)

Amazing how desperate you are to try to find some type of evidence to validate your incorrect assumption. But hey, don't let FACTS get in the way. If that's what makes you feel better, then think what you want. I never removed any comment you fucking idiot. I did notice it disappeared though﻿ and I have no idea why. Like I said (and you seem to ignore this), if I removed my own comment, there'd be a message that says "AUTHOR WITHHELD". Do you see that message? Didn't think so. But stay in denial!

Self-superior, childish, insulting, stupid BS of someone elevating﻿ himself to a condition of commentator of things he knows nothing about -- in other words, typical American. Horses aren't technology, idiot, and that's what the American cowboy was using. And I think people use buses in the MENA as well. Nothing on the vid portrays top-notch technology exclusive to any one part of the world.

Some self-righteous snob from Brazil apparently jumped on the "let's hate America" bandwagon. Shocking.
I love how you people are in such denial. You choose to micro-analyse instead of looking at the big picture. Besides the obvious cities/countries, the middle east is generally less tech advanced then the west. That's not my opinion, that's simply﻿ a fact.

What "let's hate America" bandwagon? Only "bandwagon" here is the "let's hype tired tropes about Jihadis in order to spit in the face of Arabs in general and still come out as righteous".
And what does technology have to do with this? Do you suppose people in the ME don't have access to﻿ cars and buses? Be sure not to sound like a know-nothing American in your next answer.

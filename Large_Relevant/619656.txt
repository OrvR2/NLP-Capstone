WATCH: Hannity Guest Literally Covers His Ears In Protest Of Hannity’s Questioning

Sean Hannity continued the national debate over gun rights tonight with a particular focus on the New York newspaper that published the names and addresses of every gun owner in multiple counties. Guest Leo Terrell was particularly fired up on the issue, and when it looked like he was about to really rage at Hannity, he simply covered his ears with his hands to avoid listening.
RELATED: Hannity Panel Explodes Over Gun Control Debate: ‘Just Please Shut Up!’
Hannity asked Terrell if he believes in a gunowner’s right to privacy. Terrell raised his voice and brought up the Sandy Hook shooting to argue that such information helps “alert the neighborhood of people who are mentally ill.” When Hannity dismissively asked if people should just be reporting their neighbors to the authorities, Terrell fired back, “it would have saved twenty-six lives!”
Jay Sekulow pointed out that background checks, including a person’s mental health, are required in all fifty states before they can get a gun, telling Terrell that all he’s doing is just jeopardizing the gun rights of law-abiding citizens. Hannity brought up O.J. Simpson, and instead of responding to Hannity’s point, Terrell simply put his hands over his ears and brought an end to the debate.
Watch the exchange below, courtesy of Fox News:

Ahhh, typical Liberal. Can’t process more than he’s been brainwashed with. Obviously an Obama voter. An even better headline is the sale of Current TV to al Jazeera, otherwise known as the mouthpiece for al Qaeda. Great move Mr Gore. Can’t wait for more anti American drivel. Don’t we get enough of that from Democrats?

Terrell fired back, “it would have saved twenty-six lives!” No, it would not have. Emotional, yet false. The firearms involved were legally obtained by the suspect’s mother, who complied with all of the very restrictive laws in her home state. But facts don’t matter to people who lie, and then cover their ears because they don’t want to hear the truth, even if it is being yelled at them.

Hannity is slime. He wraps himself in the flag as he passes judgement on who is “American” enough. He’s the king of sophistry and stealth bigotry. I’ll take Shep Smith and Bill O’Reilly any day and twice on Sunday then dirty myself by listening to Hannity.

Mr. Cozy is quite correct and, he might have added, IF assault rifles had been banned at the time of the murders, Adam Lanza no doubt would have used the Glock 20 handgun that also was in his possession, along with multiple clips for this semi-automatic handgun. This boy’s mother was, by all reports, a solid citizen with no criminal record. It is highly doubtful that no matter how restrictive one could have made registration of guns, she would have qualified.

I have to wonder why anyone would go on the Hannity Hour of Insanity who does not qualify under the following:  (i) possesses considerable intelligence but is paid a great deal to sit in that guest chair;  (ii) an extravert looking for that 15 minutes and is willing to stand naked on Time Square all through evening rush hour; (iii) is dumber than a bag of hammers and proves it with each appearance.
Seriously, no one volunteers to be waterboarded, and no one wants to do something worse than be waterboarded, which is to be a guest on Hannity.  You are disqualified to own a gun–are insane—if you actually want to sit in the Hannity guest chair and without having a substantial fee waiting at the end of that appearance.

Why is owning a gun a secret? They are dangerous, possibly fatal. And since guns are often used by those who are not qualified to have them (e.g. the CT shooter, or the fireman shooter) who get them from people who ARE qualified to have them, why should a person not be allowed to know that their neighbor has guns? Perhaps a parent would not want, for example, their child to hang out over at the house of someone who has many guns since frequently guns kept in homes are not properly secured in a gun safe.

(A) The number of gun owners in the U.S.
is
80,000,000.
(Yes, that’s 80 million)
(B) The number of accidental gun deaths

Remember, Guns don’t kill people, doctors do!!!

FACT: NOT EVERYONE HAS A GUN,
BUT
Almost everyone has at least one doctor. This means you are over 9,000 times more likely to be killed by a doctor than as by a gun owner!!!Now if you have more than one doctor, You’re just out of luck!!!

You really need to brush up on your history.
The Reichstag Fire in 1933 was likely a false flag whose sole purpose was to create a problem for the final solution, which was to ban Jewish firearm ownership via the German Weapons Act of 1938 and then exterminate the Jews as a scapegoat for the economic woes of early 20th century Germany.

Its not a secret, and its also nobody’s business…..There are many possibly fatal object in everyone’s house. Do we need the government to tell everyone that there is a butcher’s knife, a container of bleach, or an automobile at your house? Why would this make any difference other than to let possible criminals know which houses to invade?

See, here’s the difference: I’ve read Donald Kaul for years so I know that his ‘recommendations’ are totally rooted in hyperbole and intentionally so. Though somewhat atypical of his writings I would have to say that the circumstances surrounding the writing of his column are what led him to make his point that we need to finally listen to reason in the debate on gun control in this country. Many of the posts that I’ve read on this issue from the other side don’t have the sound of hyperbole but seem to be actual beliefs. And anyone who has a history of reading Kaul’s writings knows that he is not always as liberal or progressive as you might think but many times moderate and almost always a common sense person of the older generation. Plus he has a great dry humor.

You really need to learn some history, as is the case with most progressives and gun control advocates.

So whether your neighbor where your kids hang out has a collection of guns (which may or may not be secure in a gun safe or with trigger locks, since such safety procedures are voluntary for gun owners) is something you apparently feel you have a right to know, or at least have the right to ask, but when a newspaper publishes the names of those who have permits for guns, which is a public record, and which gives a partial heads up as to which of your neighbors has weapons in their homes, you consider that an invasion of privacy? Why?

Because guns are not anything like bleach or butcher knives. They are much much more dangerous than those, having killed over 300,000 people in the last ten years, including thousands of accidental deaths.

Obviously if a neighbor is keeping a collection of hand grenades in his home you most certainly have the right to know that. Indeed, it is illegal to have such weapons in a home, which is a significant limitation on the right to bear arms. Why? Way too dangerous. We have collectively decided that even the 2nd Amendment, which grants the right to “bear arms”, does not permit the maintenance of hand grenades in residential neighborhoods. So what about a person who is gathering a small arsenal of semi-auto assault weapons in his home? That is legal, but still potentially quite dangerous. And you say you have no right to know if your neighbor is doing that? Under what theory?

Terrell is an idiot.  Hannity only has him on because he’s unhinged.  It’s Fox News’ strategy to have on only those on the left who make Democrats and liberals look bad.
Hannity would never dare to actually have a competent, smart liberal on his little show, as he’s too scared to debate one.  So, all you see on Fox are clowns and caricatures, which you, as a pitiful, easily-duped rube of the highest order, eat up with aplomb since it reinforces your biases.

There is no law against being armed in your own home or answering the door while armed. If police in such a case opened fire, they would probably get off Scott free. Not because they were acting in a just manner, but because civilians are second class citizens compared to LEOs.

You mean besides the fact that gun permits are (or at least in Westchester county New York where the names were published by a local newspaper) a public record? Or perhaps you argue that having gun permits “should” be private? That really requires you to explain first why we should change existing law to keep gun ownership private. My argument is simply that because guns are so dangerous, being used in the killing of over 30K people a year, and given that they are often used by non-registered users who beg, borrow or steal them from registered users, like the fireman shooting and the CT shooting, we all have the right to know where the guns that may end up in illegal hands, or in the hands of a minor, like the CT shooter, may come from.

Chicago gun violence is also a result of our loose gun laws, thing is the MSMedia really doesn’t care until some suburbanites are victims, that’s simply the reality, but kid not, we need decent gun control on a Federal level, most guns in the inner city started out in Red  states, and are shipped up to Chicago and NYC, better background checks, stop straw sales and gun show sales, investigate if some clown is buying inordinate amounts of guns, Gun laws in Chicago don’t help if you can schlep across the state border for a weapon.






Promeat Locker



“The Jews made up about 1% of the population , forcible disarmament wasn’t needed.”
It made it a lot easier to herd the Jews onto trains bound for the death camps. If 6,000,000 Jews had possessed rifles, we wouldn’t know who Adolph Hitler was.
“if you are correct why are stinger missiles outlawed or 50 caliber machine guns??”
For the same reason our government is attempting to outlaw auto-loading center-fire rifles. Bullies don’t want a fight, but rather they want a defenseless victim.

The simple answer is bullet control. The right to ammo is not in the Second Amendment. Own all the guns you want. But if you want bullets you’ll have to get them from the local police department or armory and have a darn good reason for needing them.

12 armed rebels in the Warsaw Ghetto held off Nazi forces for over 3 months.
Are you suggesting that an armed citizenry cannot resist our central government’s standing army in a meaningful fashion, and thus the citizenry should relinquish any means of armed resistance? 
If one is faced with a bully which he is incapable of beating, should the victim simply cuff his own hands behind his back?
That’s what you are suggesting.

The gunman’s mom had hundreds, if not thousands, of rounds of ammo. NO civilian should be allowed to own so many bullets and store them in their homes.

So if it’s not the gun why not ban assaults like crappy Bushmasters, anyway the NVA had alot more than Kalashnikov’s and the K’s  were fully auto, in the Middle East most of the mayhem to our soldiers is from IUD’s and mortars, rifles don’t cut it cept in surprise, not to say they aren’t lethal but as a defense against a real army they won’t last. you and no gun fancier ever answers the question if you want to defend against this future impending tyranny, why not 50 calibers, or RPG’s or Stingers?






Soothsayer123



In Switzerland, which encourages gun ownership, only about 2,000 people are allowed to keep bullets on their homes. They have high-security jobs, such as guards at airports.  Everyone else keeps their bullets in local armories, separate from their guns.

God bless the Warsaw Ghetto warriors, but it was more than twelve, and if by held off you mean the poor guys and girls had to hide in cellars and pop out , and did it stop the Nazi’s,  how come for 50-60 years Europe has functioning democracies without having citizens going around with Bushmasters, and where are our impending tyrannies? They are requiring papers in Arizona, lotta good their loose carry laws are doing, when Sheriff Joe’s thugs say pull over papers please Jose. cept they don’t say please.

what makes you think .50 calibers and rpgs are not available to private citizens? if you have enough “money” and do all th “paperwork” you can own about anything. 
What part of your warped mind cannot understand it is people that break laws that are at fault..not the law abiding citizen. What part of your warped mind do you not see that no matter how many law abiding citizens own these things.. only those breaking laws will be guilty? seriously..have you ever actually “thought” about it or just keep pushing some anti-gun agenda to feel some “false security” from evil that will never stand? 
All these “bans” etc does nothing more than produce higher cost and limiting means to richer people. While adding yet another TAX base for government. Nothing is going to ensure your safety any more than is available today. it’s all a ‘false security” to pacify..are you truly that blind or want a cut in the taxbase? 
BTW, bushmasters are really not crap.. The orginal owners now sell windham arms.. nice guns from what I read in reviews. go getcha some and enjoy a day at the range.

No, it’s the case with most right wingers.  I talk to very few of them who have gone beyond high school.  Many are only functionally literate.  I grew up with these people in rural southern Illinois.  Probably your educated righties know something but most righties are not educated and that is, unfortunately, a fact.  Studies have also shown that righties are less intelligent than lefties–due mostly they think to a lack of curiosity.  They don’t want to learn new facts.

Traditionally, “permits” issued by public offices are a public record. Are there examples you can name where public permits are not a public record? As for the newspaper publishing them, to rattle gun owners’ cages probably but for other legitimate reasons too, they certainly have the right to do that. Its unsavory, yes. But surely you do not think they did anything legally wrong. 
I certainly do not believe that any criminals or potential criminals are going to rely on anything published to finger houses that supposedly do not have “handguns” since rifles are very common and a “permit” is not necessary to own those. Not to mention a host of extremely effective legal and safer self defense weapons that may be on hand, besides a quick 911 call, including several that might be more effective against an intruder who may be wearing bullet proof armor, and some that would simply not allow an intruder into the house in the first place and that cost much less than an AR-15.
As for the notion that the addresses of woman with protected orders who were named might cause them problems with their potentially violent ex, (it is also true that some woman may have been given a heads up that their listed gun owning ex has a weapon). And knowing that someone has a weapon certainly sounds more like a deterrent than anything. Isn’t that one of the arguments for owning a gun? Its not like any ex who wants to find his former other half can’t go down and check the records for himself if he wants to track down an address which was voluntarily put into the public domain by his ex.

I may not have graduated from college….oh wait a minute, that’s right, I did! (U of Minnesota, class of ’90)…but I learned way back in ELEMENTARY SCHOOL that blanket statements such as yours above: “Many (right wingers) are functionally literate,” only more fully support my Italian family’s mantra that “’tis better to be silent and be thought a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.”
Do me another favor too…please cite the studies/evidence to support your ridiculous claim that “righties are less intelligent than lefties.”  The amazing thing — to me — is that I actually think you believe your own bilge.  Sad.
Also, nice job with your “survey of 1″ brother with the Ph.D.  Beautiful.  As a “right winger,” I’ve never met anybody with a Ph.D — oh, wait, that’s right, I have…and, given the odds or probability, they are just as likely to be conservative as they are liberal.

Guns are fun I’ve shot them including the late lamented M-15[ precuser to the M-16 with a wooden stock way heavie],  that was in the old Army just had gone  over to black boots. but I know they give little real security to the average civilian [except maybe in a late night store] and are rarely needed, meanwhile they  increase the danger to the public geometrically. All it takes is some anger, or alcohol, road rage, jealousy or any combo of the above to turn your law abiding citizen into a killer when he has a gun.

If you lived near a chemical factory that was legally operating within existing law but hid the nature and danger of its operation, would you appreciate it if someone told you? And if a local newspaper announced that would you object? You have a right to know such things because even though such operations do not violate law, and the proprietor is within his rights doing what he does, and of course he has a right to privacy and all that, there is a more than usual danger that something may happen at the factory which is harmful to a neighbor, even though that probably will not happen. Likewise, the gun owner next door may use a lock on that glock by his bedside, or even lock up his selection of AR-15s that he keeps for self defense in a safe, but he may not. Indeed, he is not required to do that. And gun owners consider it an insult or even an assault on their sacred rights if you ask them about such things.
People who obtain public permits render themselves to public scrutiny so there really is no argument to condemn the newspaper for simply publishing that public information.

Hey, newspapers rattle. That is considered one of their jobs. You have no argument that what they did was illegal, or even a violation of anyone’s privacy (since they merely published a public record). You argue that what they did was nasty and in bad taste.

I agree that any person that passes background scrutiny and is otherwise qualified by age and mental disposition to own a gun should be able to own one or two. I would strongly argue against a full ban on guns. Rather, like Ruppert, I argue for us to adopt an Australia-like gun law which bans semi-auto rifles, extended clips and the like (essentially swat team gear) and tightly regulates semi-auto handgun ownership. (Because those are the guns used in most mass shootings due to their ability to fire very rapidly and reload quick.) But our discussion is not about depriving people from owning guns, that is a strawman that you just brought up for fun, rather we are talking about the public’s right to know when someone is stockpiling multiple AR-15s and ammo in their house. Yes I want to know, and I have a right to know because that is a dangerous situation in a neighborhood.

This is where you lose the argument.
Amendment Two: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed.”
The first segment of the amendment is a statement of fact.
A free state, in order to be secure in its sovereign borders, must have a standing army.  What is now known as the United States has had a standing army since 1775.  
–
The second segment of the amendment is a contingent response to the previously stated fact.  
Since the central government will have a standing army, the people ought to have adequate means of defying it should the need arise. Note than the right to bear arms refers explicitly to the people in general, not the militia. It is utterly absurd to assume that the government would ever deprive its own army of armaments.
Federalists 28, 29 and 46 support my position more eloquently Ethan I ever could.

“The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear
 arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in
government.. Laws that forbid the carrying of arms…disarm only those who are
neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes… Such laws make
things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve
 rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may
be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man…. The beauty of the Second Amendment is that it will not be needed until they try to take it.” – THOMAS JEFFERSON

I won’t challenge you on the “he won the states with more Ph.D’s” because it sounds reasonable to me — the larger population centers/cities typically have a bevy of higher educational institutions located there, too, which — common sense would tell me —  have a bevy of Ph.D graduates.
That being said, there were plenty of hard-working, non-Ph.D types (but may indeed be college graduates still) that voted for Romney — and likely know their history, too.
I do tire of the “progressive” label for everybody who’s a liberal Democrat these days.  Anybody with a firm understanding of history can acknowledge that two of the biggest progressives in American political history were Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.

In the current leftist über culture, they are smart:  both gamed the system by lying about being red Indians in order to get ahead. 
In totally unrelated news, I’m now an orphan lesbian Vietnamese boat person. 
And everything you say is now irrelevant because you’re a racist sexist homophobe and I have a D after my name.

A racist sexist homophone?  How on earth did you come up with that?  You really have quite an imagination?  Does someone pay you to do this?  Especially the racist part.  Kind of impossible in my family which consists of just about everything in the book–we are like the freaking, UN, dude.  The most frequent question asked being, ‘Are you guys are related?’, in a dubious tone.  I even have one cousin who’s gay and another who’s a transvestite.  The only ethnicity we’re lacking is Hindu.  Literally.  
As for E. Warren I read that she’s like my family, part Native American.  Don’t know what kind she is, but we’re part Kickopoo, just had it confirmed by DNA analysis.  That’s very easy to do these days.  You don’t have to LOOK Native American to be part.  Many of the people in the tribes these days barely look the part.
I sincerely doubt that you’re an orphan lesbian Vietnamese boat person.  I DO think that you’re an idiot who likes to run his mouth.

My accusations against you make as much sense as your accusations against me.
And about as much sense as calling those names at Repubs. 
Also, looks like I forgot my /snark tag. 
I was attempting to point out how “smart” it is to be like Ward Churchill and Elizabeth Warren. You know, by claiming minority status i don’t have. 
Anyway, good luck tou to, M. Your politics drive me up a wall but I don’t have any animosity toward you personally.

One of the things I like best about Mediaite is that it pisses everybody off, whether your politics are  leftist  or correct.

Governments do not make laws to overthrow  themselves…

Well, it has been a long time since I went to school, but I was taught that when a sentence is interrupted by a comma, the segment that follows refers back  to the preceding statement, so the word people refers back to Militia…these  are not two separate statements, but one complete sentence….now perhaps things  have changed and there may be some English scholars out there who can explain  the change to me…if, so, I will listen, learn, and be corrected…have at  it…

1 honest govt did, right after it threw it’s tyrannical govt off its back. Tyrannical govts wouldn’t, and if the people are armed and a tyrannical govt comes into power, their first order of business is to disarm the populace, ex Russia, China, and Germany, just to name a few. Read the declaration of independence. They wrote the 2nd amendment to preserve the free states, and made sure the people always had a right to bear arms to defend themselves from tyranny which means “to keep them free.” Here is a historical presentation of why the US guaranteed the right to bear arms. goes back 500 years. The description of the video is “In Search of the Second Amendment is a documentary film on the
American right to arms, produced by legal scholar David T. Hardy. It
tells the story via twelve professors of constitutional law, historians,
 and original documents, many never before filmed. It also tells the
story of how gun ownership figured in the civil rights movement of the
1960s, featuring two civil rights workers who armed to defend themselves
 and their friends, and how armed resistance staved off the KKK. The
documentary has been nominated for the
American Bar Association’s Silver Gavel Award for legal education. Its
creation won its producer the Second Amendment Foundation’s Bill of
Rights Award.”

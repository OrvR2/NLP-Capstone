There were so many dead people because at first, they were refused access to the exits by the staff because the staff members thought nobody﻿ would pay for their drinks, just run away. They don't say it here but I've read it elsewhere.

I've seen reports that say there was only one exit for the 2000 people to get out. 1.﻿ Fireworks aren't an indoor type of display. 2. A 2000 person crowd should have a bare minimum of 10 exits so that no more than 200 need exit the same spot thereby reducing trampling risks.
Sounds like their fire codes need seriously changing and quickly.

Right, because the average person will enter the club and the first thing﻿ they will do is ask for the safety layout... give me a break. It's the local government that must enforce safety regulations. But yes, people must be a little smarter themselves.

you're completely missing the point. All I am saying is that it's the responsibility of the local government to ensure all public venues are keeping up with safety﻿ standards. That is all. But you obviously have gone off to a completely different level which is no longer relevant to my initial point.

This happened in Brazil before too. I can't be precise as to when that happened, but I recall that this isn't the first﻿ time that fireworks have caused fire in a nightclub, resulting in a high death toll. There's no excuse for people to still be using this stuff in closed buildings!

1961, Rio de Janeiro, a fire in a circus which housed 2500 people,﻿ 'only' 323 people died, hundreds were injured. A circus- thus many, many children...
An arson case, from anger for not getting free tickets to the show. Unbelievably the perpetrators got no more than 16 years in jail.

Um, I see there is conflicting info on the circus disaster. Others﻿ do not mention arson, but suggest that sparks from a passing train close by had set the top of the tent on fire. Another item speaks of 'inferior electrical wiring' as a possible cause.

where is the call to ban or limit fire, i mean 245 killed in a night, thats﻿ a serious problem. people die by fire at a very high rate compared to some other types of death. i think there should at least be restrictions, maybe take away matches and lighters, go back to flint and steel or rubbing sticks together.

No no no, it's simple: improve evacuation procedures and not use pyrotechnics in such a small place. And why do conspiracy theories have to tap into everything that﻿ goes wrong in life? It is a bloody tragedy because of shoddy fire safety measures!

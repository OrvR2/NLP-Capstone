TREE OF LIFE | The olives attached to this miniature tree at El Celler de Can Roca, the award-winning Catalan restaurant, are both delectable and unforgettable.
Imagine a tree, a living, miniature olive tree, whose branches bear heavy, golden fruit shining like poisoned apples in the late-afternoon sun. The tree is a bonsai of sorts, gnarled and thick-trunked, rooted in a vessel that appears to have been fashioned from the earth itself. Not without difficulty, a man in a dark suit heaves it onto your table. You understand without being told that you are to pluck one of the glittery orbs and pop it into your mouth. Its skin, crisp and brittle, shatters under your teeth, releasing a complex brine, all ocean, sugar and decay, which fades to a subtly penetrating bittersweetness that lingers until it is washed away with a sip of cold wine. Does the substance of the fruit matter? The moment is sublime.
This olive, wrapped with a bit of anchovy into a microscopically thin membrane of caramel, is the first thing you taste at El Celler de Can Roca, a Catalan restaurant  that ranked second in the world on the San Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants list this year. It is a perfect representation of the possibilities of Molecular Gastronomy, or Techno-Emotional cooking, or Modernist Cuisine, where advanced cooking techniques and exotic ingredients are valued as much for their narrative possibilities as for what they might bring to a plate.

EL BULLI | The castle of the once and future king, Ferran Adrià.
Homer would have appreciated Can Roca's olive tree. Cranach would have painted it. Nietzsche would have understood it. Golden fruit set into motion the Trojan War, Götterdämmerung and, of course, expulsion from Eden. But more to the point, Can Roca's tree can be seen as a challenge to the "spherified olive," the famous explosion of olive essence contained only by a thin membrane of its own jellied juices, that was among the gastronomic miracles at Spain's El Bulli, which in its last days this summer became less a restaurant than a shrine.
El Bulli's chef, Ferran Adrià, has achieved a level of fame usually reserved for heads of state. He is celebrated as an artist, an inventor, a poet. Ambitious diners mourned the restaurant's demise—it will reopen in 2014 as a kind of culinary think tank—when they realized that they were never going to have a chance to visit the smallish seaside dining room, which had already been denying more than 2 million requests each season. The world agreed: Adrià was not just a great chef but perhaps the greatest. The king is dead. Long live the king.

MY GIRONA | Can Roca is located in the medieval town of Girona.
Even if your face may be known in every three-star in Paris, and Osaka kaiseki chefs tremble at the sound of your name, there is nothing quite like your first taste of high-church Modernist Cuisine, which is to say that branch of Adrià-inspired restaurant cooking whose first concern is presenting things as they are not. If you have been served a foam, a gel, a powder, a snow or an egg of strangely perfect consistency, you have experienced Modernist Cuisine.
If your last piece of  lamb or salmon felt rare but was obviously cooked through, that was Modernist too. Modernist tools, including the dehydrator, the liquidizer, the immersion circulator, the low-temperature steam oven, the rotovap, the smoke gun and the flask of liquid nitrogen, are now fixtures of restaurant kitchens everywhere in the world. 
Still, even if you have dined at the most important Modernist restaurants in the United States, including Alinea, WD-50, Moto and Bazaar, whose chefs can all concoct spherifications and invert-sugar resins with one eyedropper tied behind their backs, you really haven't experienced Culinary Modernism until you've tasted it in Spain, where even  journeyman chefs know how to convert foie gras into hoarfrost and mango into bouncy caviar.

Culinary Modernism may extend to every world kitchen equipped with a vacuum sealer and a jar of xanthan gum, but it is best understood as a subset of Spanish cuisine, and in Spain it is everywhere. A hotel coffee shop in Bilbao may offer dishes like ostrich loin confit or raw duck with lychee ice cream and chocolate vinaigrette. A pintxos bar in San Sebastián may feature sous-vide pigeon breast with beet-juice "blood" and edible buckshot. 
Ever since the first championship season a decade ago, when foodies realized the omnipresent foams, the repurposed breakfast cereal and concoctions of eel and apple had to come from somewhere, and serious cookbook shelves seemed as naked without fantastically expensive volumes from Adrià and Oriol Balaguer as they had without Alain Ducasse and Michel Bras just the year before, it has been taken for granted that Spain has the most inventive restaurant culture in the world. 
The cream of the G450 crowd subtly began to nudge their yachts away from Monaco's Le Louis XV toward Roses and El Bulli, and San Sebastián more or less replaced Lyon as the destination of choice for young travelers who use $50 hotel rooms as a base for exploring $500 meals. And more important, Spain began to draw the very best stagiaires, the itinerant, highly skilled apprentice chefs without whose largely unpaid labor Europe's finest restaurants would cease to function.

MODERNIST MUSEUM | The main dining room at El Celler de Can Roca.
The Spanishness of Modernist cooking owes a lot to the dominance of Adrià, who codified its tropes as surely as Escoffier cataloged the grand world of 19th-century cream sauces, but also because it is from Spanish soil that its flavors erupted: exceptionally fragrant olive oil, bitter almonds and pigs nourished on the acorns from cork oaks; small, oily fishes; snails fed on rosemary; saffron and dark chocolate; squid ink and roses; tomatoes and olives. The two centers of the movement, Catalonia and San Sebastián, may be the parts of the country closest to the evolved restaurant culture of France, but the essence of the cuisine could not be less French. Many of the best-known Modernists, including Roca, Adrià and Mugaritz's Andoni Luis Aduriz, have literally introduced Spanish soil as an ingredient, distilling its essence to perfume an oyster or sprinkling it onto a dish of steamed hake. 
I had been sent to Spain to explain why it might be the best restaurant country in the world. I was to do this on the basis of Modernist restaurants alone, restaurants on the San Pellegrino top 50 list, without reference to tapas bars or seafood dens, century-old suckling-pig specialists or rural taverns that fired their paella over fruitwood. This required a next-to-impossible reservation at El Bulli. Suddenly I was just one more supplicant trying to get a seat at Adrià's restaurant before it closed. I put in calls, faxes and emails to Luis Garcia, the charming yet elusive gatekeeper at El Bulli, but compared to him, Rao's infamous Frankie No may as well be a yes-man.

HARD ROCA | The three Roca brothers: Joan, Jordi and Josep

El Celler De Can RocaThis is how I wound up starting my Modernist Cuisine tour: not at El Bulli but at nearby rival El Celler de Can Roca, up the Costa Brava, through the olive-green hills and into the handsome cathedral town of Girona. If you neglect to spring the extra couple of euros for a GPS, you will be seeing quite a bit of Girona before you realize that the restaurant is not in the middle of town but on its industrial outskirts, half a dozen roundabouts past anything you'll recognize on a map.
Can Roca, a severe wooden fortress hovering over its small street, is reachable only through a deserted courtyard. On display in the long entranceway, as is usual in Modernist restaurants, are enough restaurant-associated volumes to stock a small bookshop. The dining room is arranged in a triangle around a glassed-in grove of birches, a space just waiting to star in a bit of eco-architecture porn from Dwell. 
Joan Roca—his brothers Jordi and Josep serve as pastry chef and sommelier—is credited as the first chef to use an immersion circulator, a tool that is now in almost every kitchen in Europe. He wrote what was for years the only manual on sous vide cooking. He invented cigar-smoke ice cream. He was an early adopter of deconstruction, which in Modernist Culinary terms means isolating the sensations of a dish and then recombining them in unexpected ways—his version of the traditional escalivada, for example, a kind of Catalan ratatouille grilled very slowly over a smoky fire, is presented here as soft globes of zucchini, pepper and eggplant served under a smoke-filled dome.

When you are served sole, it is not just a fillet, but a section of fish taken apart, deboned and put back together with meat glue, then served with five different sauces, fennel, olive, orange peel and pine nut among them, daubed on the plate in abstract-expressionist brushstrokes—five sauces, flat and undistinguished by themselves, that in combination express the Catalan Mediterranean. 
There is a certain grammar to meals at Modernist Spanish restaurants, which as a customer you are expected to understand. You will probably be led into the kitchen to shake hands with the chef or his designate, and you will admire its sterile modernity. You will be asked if you have any allergies or dislikes (often this comes months before the dinner, when you make your reservation). You will be told that a menu has been composed especially for you, which is technically true, although what you are served will be essentially what everybody else in the restaurant is eating, and you will be handed a copy of this menu as a parting gift. You will begin your dinner with a series of tiny dishes, universally called "snacks"—at Can Roca, these include chicken-skin crackers and fried anchovy skeletons fried in something like a Thai shrimp chip. (It can be difficult to determine when the snacks end and the meal proper begins.)

One of Martín Berasategui's signature dishes, Gorrotxategi, is egg resting on a liquid salad of red tubers and dewlap carpaccio.
You will never see a price until after you have finished eating, but it will usually run up to $250 apiece before wine. You can usually get a complex wine pairing if you want one, but sommeliers realize the difficulty of matching dozens of almost abstract tastes, and may suggest a modest, food-friendly wine from the region that will cost less than you expect. Every dish will be preceded by exhaustive instructions in the language of your choice, and the waiter is never happier than when he is able to tell you in which inlet today's prawn was trapped. 
Jordi Roca may be best known for a dessert that attempted to evoke the experience of Lionel Messi scoring a goal in Barcelona's Camp Nou stadium, complete with a soundtrack, synthesized grass and a simulated ball. Nothing quite so ambitious was on the menu the afternoon I visited, although there was an example of Roca's Colourology series—following a Modernist chef is a bit like following an artist like Frank Stella; you are kind of expected to keep track of each season's shows— which explored the gradations from shiso to eucalyptus to lime.

ALTA COCINA | The chef of the eponymous restaurant, Martín Berasategui, and his wife, Oneka Arregui
You know: green things. He is known to construct desserts around the components of famous perfumes, and his white lemon sorbet was accompanied by a scent strip, which conjured images of eating Italian ice next to the fat lady in an elevator. Another composition juxtaposed black olive, licorice and caramel in a way that was supposed to (and actually kind of did) transform the collective flavors into a rich, complex vanilla when you tasted them all together. 
It is reasonable to ask whether the Rocas are making an art statement or a gesture of cuisine, whether the deconstructed escalivada, as an escalivada, adds anything to the version that Grandpa whipped up on a hibachi. It may be overreaching, but the presentation of the sole seemed to refer less to a culinary precedent than to Roy Lichtenstein's famous "Five Brushstrokes," making it a sauce-based homage to a sculpture of a painting of a comic-book rendition of a wash of paint—it was as clever and intellectually coherent as at least half the entries in last year's Whitney Biennial. 
Food or art? It was a lot to chew on. I fired off another letter to Luis at El Bulli—"I have been dreaming that a table, or even a place at someone else's table, might open up"—and started on the long, lonely drive to San Sebastián on the Atlantic coast, Spain's other center of Modernist Cuisine.

CULINARY PILGRIMAGE | The property of Martín Berasategui in Basque Country, close to the ancient pilgrimage route of Compostela.

Martín BerasateguiWhat kind of eating town is San Sebastián? It's a city where the concentration of tapas bars—called pintxos bars—makes Madrid look like Columbus, Ohio. It's where businessmen cook for each other in private dining clubs instead of playing golf. It's where you can consult that list of the 50 best restaurants in the world as casually as a traveler to Arizona might look at the crumpled page on Scottsdale steakhouses ripped out of an airline magazine—four of the 50 are in the metropolitan area, which isn't bad for a city of 400,000. It's where Michelin stars are nice to have, but aren't quite enough. Basques know how to cook, they know how to eat and they have the money to pay for it.
What I'm trying to say, I think, is that the standards are pretty high.

SPANISH ARMADA | Berasategui meets with his staff before the evening service.
But I was still a little surprised to walk onto the terrace of Martín Berasategui, a restaurant I had been dying to visit for years, and find a scene not far removed from what you would have found at a Michelin three-star restaurant in late-'80s France. The tables were comfortable, the waiters white-gloved, the customers French-speaking, the rustic view almost choreographed, although we were in the middle of the residential suburb Lasarte.
The flatware and the service pieces were signed; Berasategui is an enthusiastic cross-marketer. The wine list was largely French, which makes a certain amount of sense—Bordeaux is within an easy morning's drive. Luxury is clearly the lingua franca, here at the 29th-best restaurant in the world.

A kitchen with a view
Berasategui's ascendance slightly precedes that of Modernist Cuisine, and although I have no doubt that his kitchen bristles with the latest machinery, what comes out of it seems closer to 1980s nouvelle cuisine than it does to the chem-lab cooking of the Roca brothers, when drama came from the elevation of ingredients rather than from their physical transformation. So that mille-feuille of eel with foie gras and apple, a dish that blasted its way through New York at the end of 1999? 
Still a classic at the restaurant where it was born, a layered composition of sweetnesses and richnesses that have no reason to work together, but are snapped into cohesiveness by the crisp tartness of thinly shaved green apple. There was the mandatory Modernist Explosion—in this case a plump raviolo in a light squid broth that burst into a nuanced gush of warm, buttery squid ink when you popped it with your tongue. A fennel "risotto," with tiny, sautéed dice of the bulb, foamed fennel juice and slivered raw fennel, explored the nuances of that vegetable with an obsessiveness straight out of primo Ducasse.

NEEDLE IN THE HAY | A dish Andoni Luis Adruiz calls Shhh...Cat Got Your Tongue, a haystack of cooked beef-tongue fibers
And in probably the only dish that might qualify as High Modernist, there was a fillet of rouget garnished with a mosaic of its own crunchy fried scales—fried scales!—with seaweed and a savory white-chocolate foam. Still, by 2012, fried scales may be nearly as antique as a well-mounted sauce béarnaise. I could swear that I saw one of the women in the restaurant spoon-feeding the rouget to her infant. Clearly, Martín Berasategui was not Modernist enough.
It had been a long day. I drove to my hotel, perched above a crumbling theme park, atop a mountain overlooking San Sebastián's bay. I typed another letter to Luis: "A single tweet about my missed reservation drew 200 tweets in response," I wrote. "They suggested everything from vengeance to suicide."

AzurmendiThe next day dawned warm and clear, and by the time I drew back the blinds, the beach far below was already crowded with sunbathers taking advantage of an unexpectedly sunny day in June. Would I join them? I would not. There was lunch to attend to, although not at Arzak, the eighth-best restaurant in the world, which had unaccountably closed for the month, but at Azurmendi, a Michelin two-star whose chef, Berasategui protégé Eneko Atxa, had become a star at gastronomic conferences.

Mugaritz's master chef, Andoni Luis Adruiz
Azurmendi is about an hour down the coast from San Sebastián, in a green, agricultural valley not far from Bilbao. It shares its address with a winery specializing in txakoli, the thin, high-acid wine of the Basque coast, and it is massive in the way that $10 million Aspen ski chalets are massive—you could probably stage a Knicks game in the soaring entrance hall. Azurmendi seems to be a favorite of Bilbao businessmen with three hours for lunch. Unlike many of the Modernist chefs in Spain, Atxa seems devoted to pleasure. 
There is a warmed egg yolk on a spoon, injected with a dense broth, that explodes with the flavor of black truffles; braised oxtail contained in a cube constructed from paper-thin wafers of grilled bread; and a garden of tiny vegetables—Atxa's version of the Modernist classic gargouillou—planted in a raised bed of dark-black beetroot soil. A bit of dewlap, a Shakespearean word that here refers to the wobbly double-chin of an Iberico pig, is cooked for many hours at low temperature, then seared off and laid over a spoonful of mushroom duxelles: It is an ultimate expression of the flavor of well-raised pig.

The restaurant's kitchen
A globe of fried blood sausage, surrounded by a fairy ring of tiny wildflowers and chopped fried cabbage, is slowly immersed in a smooth puree of red beans poured from a pitcher, whose impossibly concentrated flavor makes the table for a moment smell like an entire tapas bar. Red beans with fried cabbage is a traditional Basque family dish, humble as Sunday supper. Here, it transformed into haute cuisine.
A twitchingly fresh oyster, garnished with bits of mushroom cooked to resemble seaweed, balances on pebbles at the bottom of a glass bowl. The waiter pours a little pitcher of liquid into the bowl, which is immediately enveloped in a thick, fragrant fog. The liquid is seawater, taken from a local inlet and enhanced; the cold sea mist brings you to the shore in a way no mere taste could. Atxa is renowned in gastronerd circles for his use of ultrasound in extracting scents, and this particular dish is supposed to have engaged the talents of half a university physics department, but the effect comes off less as a technical feat than as a triumph of naturalism. 
Even the silliest inventions here, like the dessert that consisted mostly of shiny apple-flavored bubbles clinging to a vertical slab of slate, are meant to make you smile. Gold-plated corn nuts? Why not!

SEASIDE DELIGHTS San Sebastián's spectacular La Concha bay

MugaritzIt must be said that no chef in the world divides people quite the way Andoni Luis Aduriz does at Mugaritz, whose presentations range from the awkward to the aggressive. His side projects include a film musical about food in Ethiopia and Peru, handsome editions of Michael Pollan books translated into Spanish and a multimedia banquet attached to a production of "Titus Andronicus," whose most famous culinary moment involves slaughtered princelings baked into a pie. In interviews, he praises the beauty of insipidness, herbs that whisper, quiet flavors. He likes local plants, especially the unglamorous ones, and loathes salt, cheerful splashes of acidity and wisps of crunch. If cooking has a real avant-garde, a style that frightens away the squares, it is to be found not among the splashy gross-out artists but at Mugaritz, amid the herb garden, on this green, rural hillside only 20 minutes outside San Sebastián but seemingly light-years away. Aduriz's is a melancholic cuisine. 
When you sit down at Mugaritz, you are presented with two small envelopes. One is marked "150 minutes…submit!"; the other, "150 minutes…rebel!" You are asked to choose between them. You choose "rebel"—why wouldn't you?—and slide a printed card out of the appropriate envelope. It reads: "150 minutes to feel embarrassed, flustered, fed up. 150 minutes of suffering." You are beginning to get an idea of this place, even beyond the severe lines of the dining room and the broken-plate sculptures that appear on each table in place of fresh flowers.
His signature presentation is called Edible Stones, and when it comes to the table, there it is—edible stones, which is to say potatoes encased in a thin coating of kaolin clay and then fired until the clay is glossy and the potatoes are more or less cooked. They are colored with squid ink and a Japanese tooth powder made from charred eggplant. They do, in fact, resemble rocks, the smooth, rounded ones you find in stream beds.

A detail from a Mugaritz dish of broken walnuts, cool milk cream and Armagnac jelly
Have you ever wondered what it might be like to eat a stone? Because it's probably less wonderful than you might have imagined as a preschooler. The clay cracks under your teeth—the coating is no thicker than a shrimp shell—leaving behind only a clean, powdery residue and a lingering taste of unwashed potato. Kaolin clay is the preferred nosh of pregnant women afflicted with pica; the famous dirt-eaters of Georgia. It was also at one time the main ingredient in Kaopectate. In parts of Turkey, cookbook author Paula Wolfert says, you can buy little jars of the stuff to season your food. (Aduriz sprinkles a little of the powder on a pale dish of hake and cabbage sprouts.) It is clear that you can eat clay. The question is why you would want to.
And what, for example, could explain the shiny olives that turn out to be beans coated in an emulsified tapenade, which are less good than either beans or olives, or a foamy "beer" made from clarified vegetable broth, or a sheet of tasteless edible plastic smeared with a bit of lobster coral? Why is the delicious ragout of artichoke and bone marrow spooned into a gummy, hollowed-out puff of bread made from ground kudzu, a substance that the Japanese transform into bouncy, transparent noodles? It is fun to be handed a tumbler of Armagnac that reveals itself as clarified quail broth, although you might wish the broth to have the same weight and intensity as the brandy, also maybe—I am weak!—to have seen a touch of salt. I enjoyed the haystack of what tasted like crisped Chinese beef floss—it looked very much like the actual haystack outside the window—although I am not sure the effect is worth the kitchen hours necessary to tease apart cooked beef tongues into individual fibers with toothpicks. Bits of local rockfish stacked so that your teeth understood the difference in textures between each of them; gooey cod throats juxtaposed with a kind of pine nut porridge; a sugar cone made out of actual sugar, filled with ice milk punctuated with blossoms and cast-chocolate nails—I got the point, I guess, although it was a lot like watching a sad movie without subtitles. 
Perhaps Mugaritz is the restaurant equivalent of a $200 California Cabernet: It makes a statement odd enough and bold enough that it stands out among dozens of examples of its type, and it still resonates on the palate weeks later; a meal meant to stun you in retrospect as much as it is to satisfy you at the time you eat it. Or perhaps, it too is just art. 
I peek at the contents of the envelope labeled "Submit": "150 minutes to feel, imagine, reminisce, discover. 150 minutes to contemplate." If this meal was a test, I had failed before I tasted a single bite of food.
I drive back to my mountaintop lair. There is just enough time to send off an email before I walk downstairs to wander through the fun park's mirrored labyrinth.
"Dear Luis: I have written you this week far more faithfully than I have ever corresponded with either of my brothers. I feel as if we are practically family by now."

El BulliWhen I wake up in the morning, the day before I am to leave Spain, I find an email with news. A table had been found for me at El Bulli that evening, at 6:30 sharp. Did I mention that I was in San Sebastián, 400 miles distant from El Bulli, which is on a secluded inlet just south of the French border? No matter: Many hours later, I limped into Roses, hopped into a taxi to take me the last twisting miles to the restaurant, and arrived panting on the restaurant's doorstep only 90 minutes past the reservation time. The taxi driver insisted on snapping a picture of me in front of the restaurant's famous sign. "For memory," he said.
Luis stepped through the door and greeted me like a brother. Adrià stood awkwardly just inside the entrance to his kitchen. He shook my hand with the enthusiasm of Kobe Bryant cornered by a season-ticket holder. It didn't matter. I was in.
If you have read anything about gastronomy in the last decade, you have probably seen your share of what Slate called the I Ate at El Bulli piece, describing the experience with a level of detail usually reserved for high-class erotica. There are also the inevitable meta-articles, describing the experience in the process of acknowledging that even the idea of these descriptions are clichéd. Sam Sifton, the New York Times restaurant critic, wrote a parody description of Adam Platt's nearly parodic description in New York magazine, then tweeted it in a doubly parodic way. The tweets about the blogs about the tweet about the parody of the review about the review set into motion tsunamis of meta that threatened to engulf the earth. Plus, the restaurant is closed now. If you want to taste this food, you'll have to visit the El Bulli satellite in a hotel outside Sevilla when it reopens in March or wait to be invited as a guest of the academy in 2014. 
Do you care that I was served 41 courses, unless it was 39 or 43; that the rhythm of the meal involved intersecting series of improvisations on the themes of ravioli, Parmesan cheese, shellfish and nuts; or that the hare organs were served with a smeary wineglass of Type-O that turned out to be reduced beet juice? 
I sat on a lovely patio, like the terrace of a nice, old beach house, with worn brick, bushy Mediterranean plants and precise but pleasant lighting. Outside, waves lapped the black shore, and tinny music blared from a party way down the beach. There were distant shouts; the music of women's laughter. Lights from a boat bobbed in the cove.
As Clarke's Third Law states, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." But the reason I suspect Adrià is stepping back in the prime of his career, is that by now we've seen all his tricks—the hot foam on cold drinks, the olive oil chips, the fine mists of cheese, even the friable wafers that collapse into dust like the creature in the Mummy's Tomb. We see the hat; we expect a rabbit. 
And although his air bread really melts into air, and the delicate punch of his reverse-encapsulated olives reminds you why so many chefs try to duplicate them, it has gotten to the point where his methods have so thoroughly saturated the food culture that the dudes with the pig's blood crusts and the shavings of retired dairy cow revere him more than they look to him as the future. Grant Achatz is already preparing to serve a menu of El Bulli cover versions at his Next in Chicago, and as much as you want to say it's too early, that Adrià is still a creative chef, you've got to admit it makes sense, the way that Neil Diamond songs are sounding pretty good on the radio right now, and the oldies stations are playing a lot of Dr. Dre.
When you leaf through one of the El Bulli books, either the fantastically complicated manuals that come slipcased with DVDs, or the more user-friendly "A Day at El Bulli," you will notice that they read more like shop manuals, with precise instructions, quantities measured to the gram, and logical schematics than they do like cookbooks—there is scarcely a sensual description, a whiff of aroma or an indication of texture to be seen.
Does El Bulli–style cooking hew a little close to the 1960s minimalist conceptualism of Lawrence Weiner or Yoko Ono? Perhaps. Is there also a bit of the infomercial in the cuisine? Definitely. If you go to albertyferranadria.com, you'll find a pretty sizable line of branded products developed in Adrià's Barcelona studio, chemicals and devices that make it not just possible but easy to turn out your own melon caviar, lemon air, peach paper and black-olive Oreos. 
As much as I loved the restaurant, what came to mind was those scenes that pop up a few minutes into James Bond movies, where M leads the spy downstairs to see what the boys in the lab coats have whipped up. And you get the feeling that Adrià is no more concerned as to why anybody might feel the need to nibble at a frozen Gorgonzola volleyball or crunch a gold-plated dowel of raw soy sauce than Q, the master technician, needs to contemplate why anybody might need a key chain capable of taking down a helicopter. It is cool, and it can be done. In the end, that is enough.

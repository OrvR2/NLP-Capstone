WTF is the matter﻿ - Japanese or Russian car design? 2 idiots (parents, having a baby-seat onboard) prefer to place their child to sleep cozy, on the make-shift cot made by throwing a blanket on to the rear windshield luggage rack... Damn great protection, car safety, blah-blah...

What is the issue of "What make of a vehicle was﻿ it"? WTF? It does not matter if two idiots (parents, who had baby seat on-board) prefer to have their infant placed "to sleep cozy" as they thought, by making a make-shift cot with a blanket placed on the plastic rear luggage rack, where rear windshield was the only protection?

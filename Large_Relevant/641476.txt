When the April figures on unemployment were released May 4, they were more than disappointing. They were deeply disturbing. 
While the unemployment rate had fallen from 8.2 percent to 8.1 percent, 342,000 workers had stopped looking for work. They had just dropped out of the labor market. 
Only 63.6 percent of the U.S. working age population is now in the labor force, the lowest level since December 1981. 
During the Reagan, Bush I and Clinton years, participation in the labor force rose steadily to a record 67 percent. The plunge since has been almost uninterrupted. 
Here is a major cause of the economic malaise of the 21st century, a condition over which a president has little control. A shrinking share of our population is carrying an ever-expanding army of dependents. 
If this were a result of American women going home to have kids, that would be, as it was after World War II, a manifestation of national vigor and health. 
But that is not the case here. 
The number of Americans of working age not in the labor force grew in April from 87,897,000 to 88,419,000 — by an astonishing 522,000. This is an immense army for the rest of society to carry. 
Why are Americans dropping out? 
Some have given up looking for jobs in towns they grew up in, because the jobs are gone and not coming back, and they don't want to leave. Some are rejecting the low-wage unskilled work being offered, because the alternative — unemployment checks and federal and state welfare — is not all that torturous. 
With some, the work incentive was never implanted. With others, the option of moving back in with the parents is not all that terrible. 
America, it seems, is becoming less like the country we grew up in, in its attitudes about work and idleness, and more like Europe. 
Whatever its causes, this social and economic torpor that seems beyond the capacity of presidents to correct or cure is a dark cloud over the hopes of Barack Obama for a second term.
And yet another ominous cloud, no longer on the far horizon, is now directly above: the impending departure from the labor force of 70 million baby boomers in the next two decades. 
According to the Statistical Abstract of the United States, from Jan. 1, 1930, to Dec. 31, 1935, there were 13 million births in the U.S. From January 1940 through December 1945, there were 16 million. 
This was the Silent Generation, born in Depression and war. It never produced a president, and never will, unless Ron Paul catches fire pretty quickly. The Greatest Generation gave us six presidents, starting with JFK and ending with Bush I. Our three most recent presidents — Bill Clinton, Bush II, Barack Obama — are all baby boomers 
And here we come to the heart of our next economic crisis. 
If one adds up all the children born between Jan. 1, 1946 and Jan. 1, 1965, the era of the great American baby boom, the total comes to 77 million babies born in the United States. 
Why is this so significant now? 
Because this year, 2012, the first wave of baby boomers, all those born in 1946, like Clinton and George W. Bush, will reach 66, and eligibility for full Social Security and Medicare benefits. The boomers, en masse, will start moving off payrolls onto pension rolls. 
Let us assume the 77 million boomers are down to 72 million. This means that over the next 20 years, boomers will be retiring and reaching eligibility for Social Security and Medicare at a rate of 3.6 million a year, or 300,000 a month, or 10,000 every day. 
Three hundred thousand a month leaving the labor force may help to explain its shrinkage. And as the boomers are the best-paid, best-educated generation we produced, the loss of their collective skills, abilities and tax contributions will be as heavy a blow to the nation as the funding of their Medicare and Social Security will be a burden to the taxpayers they leave behind in the labor force. 
Since Roe v. Wade, abortions have carried off 53 million of the generations that were to replace the boomers. While those 53 million lost have been partially replaced by 40 million immigrants, legal and illegal, our recent immigrants have not exhibited the same income- or tax-producing capacity as boomers. 
In 1965, LBJ announced his plan to convert our ordinary society into a Great Society. Since then, trillions have been spent. 
The fruits of that immense investment? The illegitimacy rate, dropout rate, crime rate and incarceration rate have set new records, as the test scores of high school students have plummeted to new lows.
Our labor force is shrinking, the number of dependent U.S. adults is growing, our social programs are failing, and our best educated and most productive generation is retiring.

So, the dawn is breaking in the darkness of Pat's mind: America, he finally realizes, "is becoming less like the country we grew up in...." But this isn't full daylight. America is NOT the country we "boomers" grew up in! We had parents who believed in and reached out for the American Dream. And they passed on to us a perceived certainty that we too, could and would achieve even greater prosperity and security than they had achieved. That certainty of success has become an acceptance, by many, of a future of mediocrity. This generation is looking for the easy path to a marginal existence. Failure wasn't an option for our parents or ourselves. It's now fully embraced by parents as a probability for their children. And today's parents, unlike those of boomers, have bought into the futility of any attempt to surpass their parents' accomplishments. They transmit this sense of futility to their offspring. We see 2nd and 3rd generation welfare and unemployment dependent Americans. I don't believe in abandoning those who are in genuine need. I believe we all are entitled to a helping hand when we are down. But I firmly believe that we MUST instill in all those in the "safety net" a sense of personal responsibility and a clear understanding that these are temporary measures. We are our brother's helpers, not their keepers. Tough love for our fellow men benefits them more than a 
free ride for life. We need to put these people to work as a condition of their support payments, and require them to gain new skills. Gainful employment and ongoing self improvement are the keys to restoring beliefs in personal worth, and in achieving dreams!

Pat continues on to mention the loss of their tax contributions.

What I am curious about,and have not seen any studies on is:
How will the retiring generation's 401K plans effect the country's tax collection over that time.Many have been investing in their plans for years,taking advantage of the tax deferrment on contributions.When they begin to cash in their plans they will have to pay taxes on them and I'd just don't have any idea of what kind of numbers it will add up to and I'd really like to know.

Not an arguement for or against anything in the article just a curiosity.

Meanwhile, elsewhere on Yahoo!, we hear that "The number of long-term unemployed workers aged 55 and older has more than doubled since the recession began in late 2007".

But wait, aren't those Baby Boomers?  They of the stalwart work ethic?  The most educated, best-paid generation we've ever produced?  Whose skills and abilities we will be hard-pressed to replace?  THOSE baby boomers?

Or could it be that there is no shortage of younger, skilled, well-educated workers, and the problem is a lack of jobs?

Jobs are gone because corporations don't want American labor, they want to pay third world wages. Low wages are what is hurting America, oh! except for CEO's

The world has changed.  That's an inescapable fact that is only now coming home.  Automation, computers, loss of labor intensive manufacturing jobs and worldwide competition are all combining to create a brave new world.

There is no single factor that can be singled out for the changes and certainly not the factors Buchanan writes about.   We are the victims of success.  America is the most successful country in history and we've exported our ideas if not only our ideals to the rest of the world and they are catching up,  India, China, South America and even Africa are starting to come into their own while Americans look at what was and not what is.

Where once 5% unemployment was seen as the norm economists now are looking at and hoping to reach 6% and will count that as full employment.  Companies aren't hiring not because of taxes or regulations but because they don't have to.  Where armies of accountants were once required to keep the books balanced software does it with a handful of data punchers.  Where skilled hands once fabricated precision parts computer controlled lathes now do the job.  Program once and forget about it.

Where labor is needed companies will go to where it's cheapest.  It's pure capitalist economics and multinational companies have no vested or patriotic interests in the countries in which they headquarter.  America won't get those jobs back unless we accept the wage and working conditions of China or Vietnam but even the most rabid conservatives would have a hard time swallowing that.

So where are the failure points in our society?  Education, healthcare, government, big business, social institutions all share a piece of the blame and must work together to find a solution but at a time when we're facing the most urgent need to redefine what is America since the Civil War we are also the most polarized since the Civil War with one side wanting to return to a past that never was and the other side that only has a vague grasp of the problems and an equally vague and limited vision of the future with options limited to reacting to crisis rather than planning.

It's way past time for the right to stop talking about American exceptionalism and start dealing with the realities of today's world.  And it's time for the left to stop fighting the battles of the past and reacting to the issue of the day rather than laying out a vision for a future dealing with an aging population, failing schools, diversity, economic entrenchment and a global economy that two oceans no longer protect us from.  In short it's time for America to grow up.

Mr Buchanan, you should deal with the fact that American families are HEAVILY PUNISHED for being economically constructive and having children. The only ones rewarded are parasites and special interests (two names for the same thing, actually).

In February 2009, Pat penned a column titled "The Metrics of National Decline" and would make a good companion reading to this particular column.

The taxpayers are suckers.  These are the replacements.  Good luck with that.

"The report documented illegal aliens filing the IRS Additional Child Tax Credit form for children -- often nieces and nephews -- who have never lived in the United States. To legally qualify, a child must be present in the filer's U.S. residence for over half the year.
"We've seen sometimes 10 or 12 dependents, most times nieces and nephews, on these tax forms," a tax preparer-turned-whistleblower told WTHR News. "The more you put on there, the more you get back."
"Here's a return right here: we've got a $10,300 refund for nine nieces and nephews."

We are a mirror image of Japan. Deeply in debt, hiding bank losses and a rapidly aging population. In 1981 the Japanese market was 34k now it is less than 10k. No need for stores,restaurants and such as retired folks will be cash strapped and if not they will not need to consume nearly as much stuff.

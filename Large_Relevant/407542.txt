5daysagoPolice: Brazil nightclub fire kills at least 233A fire broke out early Sunday morning at a night club in Santa Maria, in southern Brazil, killing revelers — many of them students. NBC's Mike Taibbi reports. By Jeff Black, Staff Writer, NBC NewsUpdated at 1:23 a.m. ET: At least 233 people were killed after a band’s fireworks show sparked a rapidly moving fire in a packed nightclub in southern Brazil and fleeing patrons were unable to find their way out, local police said.Follow @NBCNewsWorld
 The bodies removed from the Kiss nightclub in the southern city of Santa Maria were taken to the Municipal Sports Center gymnasium for identification, police said.Major Gerson da Rosa Ferreira, who led rescue efforts at the scene for the military police, told Reuters that the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled. Police Maj. Cleberson Braida Bastianello told the Associated Press by telephone that the toll had risen to 233 with the death of a hospitalized victim.

Officials earlier counted 232 bodies that had been brought to the gymnasium in Santa Maria.In addition to the number of deaths, more  than 100 people were injured, police said, and most remain hospitalized. Police officials had reported earlier in the day that 245 people were  killed. The  death toll could still rise, police said later, from the  people who are  injured.Fire brigade colonel Guido Pedroso de Melo told O Globo newspaper that rescuers had difficulty entering the premises because of "a barrier of bodies" at  the entrance to the club.Television footage monitored by Reuters overnight showed people crying outside the club as shirtless firefighters used sledge hammers and axes to knock down an exterior wall to open up an exit. Agencia RBS via APPeople help a man injured in a nightclub fire in Santa Maria city, Brazil, on Sunday.Rodrigo Moura, who the newspaper Diario de Santa Maria identified as a security guard at the club, said it was at its capacity of between 1,000 and 2,000 people and patrons were pushing and shoving to escape, the AP reported. Police estimated the crowd at some 900 revelers.Fire officials said at least one exit was locked and that club bouncers, who at  first thought those fleeing were trying to skip out on bar tabs, initially  blocked patrons from leaving, Reuters reported.The club's management said in a statement it would help authorities with their investigation, Reuters reported.One of the club's owners has surrendered to police for questioning, GloboNews TV reported. "It was really fast. There was a lot of smoke, really dark smoke," survivor Aline Santos Silva, 29, told Globonews TV. "We were only able to get out quickly because we were in a VIP area close to the door." President Dilma Rousseff cut short a visit to Chile and visited families of the victims at the Municipal Sports Center, where relatives were gathering to identify the bodies. She met with relatives of the injured at Hospital de Caridade de Santa Maria.Rousseff declared a national three-day mourning period for victims of the fire. “Sad Sunday!” Tarso Genro, the governor of Rio Grande do Sul state where the club is located, tweeted. “We are taking all of the possible and appropriate actions,” the tweet read, according to a rough translation by NBC News. “I will be in Santa Maria later this morning.”The precise cause of the fire was still under investigation, authorities said. But Luiza Sousa, a civil police official in Santa Maria, told Reuters that the blaze started when someone with the band ignited what was described as a flare, which then set fire to the ceiling. The fire spread "in seconds," Sousa said. The tragedy in Brazil recalled other nightclub disaster. A fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in 2003 killed 100 people after pyrotechnics used on stage by the rock band Great White set ablaze foam used for soundproofing on the walls. A Buenos Aires nightclub blaze in 2004 killed nearly 200 people. Reuters noted that Brazil's safety standards and emergency response capabilities are under particular scrutiny as the country prepares to host the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Brazilian state’s Health secretary, Ciro Simoni, told the news service that emergency medical supplies from all over the state were being sent to the scene. Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore related topics: brazil, fire, nightclub, featured

Everyone knew someone that died or was injured in that fire. I knew several people and even had an employee who was there that night. She spent 2 months in the hospital. How fireworks could be allowed inside a building after 100 people died that night is beyond insane.1 vote#281 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:14 PM ESTDenis JoyalTom----where was Obama in southern RI that was devastated by Sandy? In fact Bush did a better job after Katrina than Obama has done RI. The place is still a mess and there are no FIMA trailors like Bush sent to LA.2 votes#282 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:19 PM ESTcheryl-1989378I was up late and remember watching on television the RI. Station fire.  That incident was so horrible and kept thinking to myself later on why would anyone use pyrotechnics in an enclosed space.  Unfortunately it usually takes a tragedy before change takes place and even then sometimes nothing changes.  Not to offend anyone, but I've heard bribery is common south of the border.  My heart goes out to those poor families that have to deal with this.1 vote#283 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:31 PM ESTthe-ChiefNo different than the coconut grove fire in the US. The biggest and deadliest fire in US history involving a nightclub. It can happen anywhere as many have stated in this thread. What matters is what politicians do after this occurs. In the U.S., eight different national fire laws were enacted at a national level. No more duplicate disasters like coconut grove. What will Brazil do. It's great that their leader comes home to do the politically correct thing, but traveling to Rio four times, I can say that Rio and most big cities in Brazil are just one big party. This has happened before, just not with the high number of deaths. Will their president do different than the other leaders in the past. They better get their act together because the Olympics will be there very soon and international travelers will expect more than another tragedy where their president tells them how sorry she is. Lots of critics in this post ( yes I read the last five pages), ....read up on coconut grove and do your homework to see what Brazil should do. This story deserves a lot more than opinions and lip service. We'll see what happens in the next year. Like I said the Olympics will be there soon and Brazilians are very proud people who, like many in other countries, refuse to admit their short comings when it comes to life safety.1 vote#284 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:32 PM ESTRon-918710Chief - actually a bit different from the Coconut Grove Fire.
Coconut Grove was more a result of the lack of fire resistant decorations ... no record of "firework-like devices" that I'm aware of.
But regarding the loss of life, very similar .... lack of building codes played a major role resulting in the unfortunate loss of so many lives.#284.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:21 PM ESTthe-ChiefRon, thanks for the correction, I sometimes get the fires mixed up. I was actually thinking of the Station nightclub fire. The nightclub band used pyrotechnics and the rear door exits were locked when the fire started. The video is horrible and I'm sure no less horrific than what the scene was in Brazil. Go to firefighternation and type in station nightclub fire, for anyone to get an idea of what it may have been like on the inside.#284.2 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 9:59 AM ESTDenis JoyalThe bands should practice more, play better and then they wouldn't need the fireworks to put on a show.#285 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:33 PM ESTcheryl-1989378Lilarose-I agree, I'd be heading for the door as soon as I saw pyrotechnics were going to be used.  I do the same-hotels, planes, know where you can exit.#286 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:35 PM ESTFred-2606845Strict fire codes work.  One can have safe night clubs anywhere on the planet, if strict fire codes are in place and enforced.  This tragedy happened because the band lit off fireworks inside an over crowded building and the only egress point was blocked.  It boils down to greed.  This greedy business owner was more interested in profits than customer safety.  I work in this industry and I'm always telling my kids when they enter a building to locate and know where the exits are located.  Sadly, in this case, it probably wouldn't have mattered.  Maybe now, Brazil will legislate new fire codes.  They really need it.      #287 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:35 PM ESTthe-ChiefCompletely agree Fred, however, being to Rio three times, I can tell you that fire codes are not followed and greed is the rule of the night. Some of Brazil's biggest nightclubs do this very often,...now what will be interesting is to see if they start enforcing the codes they tell everyone they have.#287.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 10:04 AM EST

maz-537846My sympathies to the victims and their families. I am wondering why they could no get out? Since the Rhode Island incident and many others, where the exits where blocked because owners were too cheap to pay for guards at the doors...so they blocked them. I hope for the club owners own sake he had a cintract which was signed, forbidding pyrotechnics. he will be out of the legal suits to follow. If not...he is really, really...stupid..the band is TOTALLY stupid. I wish them nothing but financial annihilation. They needed to check on the fire protection provided in the structure. But, then again, if they are from South America...they got no brains at all for common sense. Fry them all. MY opinion ONLY for mass murderers.#288 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:46 PM ESTNick1970-3617005Nightclubs always are known for something bad happening. It can be a shooting, a fight, a fire, or something else. Not to mention the drugs, alcohol, and young people who can't control their hormones. There is a reason why nightclubs have a negative reputation. There were 900 people in a building with only one way out. I'm not surprised something like this happened.#289 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:59 PM ESTchris-2252558But yet our politicians want to ban guns!#289.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:16 PM ESTluckyboy-2090407
Our  Condolences to the families From THE USA...................
Time to get New Building Codes - ONE EXIT Come On People !
1 vote#290 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:02 PM ESTGandi5000brazil  needs to seriously consider banning fire. banning fire of any kind  needs to be seriously considered. how many more senseless deaths have to  occur at the hands of evil people starting fires? if it wasnt for fire,  these 180 or more people would still be alive. if brazil bans fire from  everyone, then there will be no deaths at the hands of fire ever again.
this is really the only smart thing to do. wont someone think of the children?
 
 
Right on!#291 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:03 PM ESTshade101AMEN! AMEN!#291.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:25 PM ESTRichochet12trajedy trajedy!!! but sorry to say that these revelers are all going to hell where they will continue to burn because i doubt they have time to repent,,half of them were drunk already!!1 vote#292 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:05 PM ESTchris-2252558How do you know that the victims weren't praying during the fire or while being burned?  #292.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:15 PM ESTRichochet12tragedy tragedy!!! but  sorry to say that all those dead revelers will continue to burn in hell when judgement come because i doubt any of them had time to repent...i bet most were drunk or high on some other drug!!#293 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:09 PM ESTRon-918710As one involved with Code enforcement in the US - it seems quite odd that a security guard would not know the "capacity" of the nightclub ... "1,000 - 2,000"  ...  that's a 100% increase.#294 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:12 PM ESTchris-2252558Now wait a second, I remember something like this happening here in the US a few times,  Why didn't all these politicians call for closing of the nightclubs.  I mean Come on. more people died through parting at nightclubs then they did with these school shootings we have but they want to ban guns?  #295 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:13 PM ESTAngels91This is such a tragedy and the owners of the club should be arrested for allowing so many people in a building up to 2,000 people with fireworks going on inside was a death trap the same thing happened a few years ago in another club, how an anyone get out in a situation that people are trapped there is no room to move and did the building have sprinklers that would of at least help put some of the fire out, I hope others learn from this tragedy that they need to make sure they put their safety first before some concert that was over crowded so the owners could make a lot of money and did not care about the safety of the people there.#296 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:14 PM ESTAvarage GuyThis is what right wing conservatism is all about:
It's always the same story: locked fire exits so greedy rich owners  can make a few extra bucks, bouncers who are ignorant and untrained, so  greedy rich owners can save money, and clubs filled over capacity , so  rich greedy owners can make more money, this is what conservatives are  all about: fighting to help the rich get richer and throwing poor people  under the bus to do it.
If Romney had got elected nothing would be regulated anymore in America, cause all the people who died are part of the poor 47% conservatives don't care about.2 votes#296.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:23 PM EST

shade101I don't get it! Not at all! What part of going to concerts with fireworks and no exits don't people understand? There ain't NO band on this earth I want to see that bad!#297 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:23 PM ESTAvarage GuyYou have to force rich people to not put the lives of poor people in danger to make money, because they are not responsible enough to do it on their own, it's always been like that, only conservatives think things like more guns on the street will save people or less regulation is best. This keeps happening because of greed, and the people who let the rich take advantage of the poor.1 vote#297.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:26 PM ESTMissy-814760My condolences to the families of the victims.  
May those whose lives were lost rest in peace.  And may God pour forth a spirit of comfort upon their families.#298 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:28 PM ESTInQueenMedb'sTerritoryShould property rights trump human rights? The night club seemed to have a mentality to exercise total control of their patrons probably due to the private property concept which led to the patrons losing control over their own lives when they were inside the property. It is like the patrons are illegal aliens in somebody else's country. Losing life in a night club due to the conceptions of its property owner could be like TV and computer content becoming less interesting due to copyright, trademark, intellectual property protection, political correctness, and supposed viruses taking control away from the users of TVs and computers. Is this the way that it has to be? Do our lives have to be in the balance, and can't the Internet be free of viruses and commercialization of content without spying and loss of user control? Dreams....#299 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:29 PM ESTHobbyChefOur Father, who art in heaven,hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come;thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.Give us this day our daily bread;and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us;and lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil. Amen4 votes#300 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:42 PM ESTOhhhPinnnYunnnMay the souls lost to this world rest in peace.
May the mourning of family, friends, and loved ones be shortened. 
May government officials see to it that this be the last of such travesties.
Dear Brazil, you are in our prayers.5 votes#301 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:50 PM ESTAngus FoxAnyone setting off pyrotechnics in a night club should be held criminally liable for any deaths. Any patrons who stuck around to see a pyrotechnics show must be real dimwits.  This is not the first time a pyrotechnics display in a nightclub has resulted in carnage.  Some people are absolutely unteachable.  Darwinian evolution does work.#302 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:52 PM ESTThere's a slow train comin'.."The Station" night club fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island was similar. Pyrotechnics that caught the walls around the stage in fire. A year later the club owners were only given a slap on the wrist and those that survived with no insurance got little in compensation having to pay off their medical bills themselves from for ICU and burn treatments.1 vote#303 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:54 PM ESTAl KydaWhen survival is at stake, it's always a free-for-all.  Any semblance of cooperation or human decency goes right out the window, even if it's to the detriment of everyone.  It's similar to the situation with Repugnicans in Congress after last November.1 vote#304 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:57 PM ESTJump to discussion page: 1 ...  9 10 11 12 13 14Leave a Comment:Name: Email Address (will be verified, but never shown): You're in Easy Mode.

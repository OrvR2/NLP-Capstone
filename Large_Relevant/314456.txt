LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — A gunman firing into a vehicle killed two people and wounded a juvenile Tuesday as they sat in the parking lot of an eastern Kentucky community college.
The campus was locked down for more than an hour while police searched the two buildings of Hazard Community and Technical College in Hazard, Ky., to ensure there was no further danger before allowing students to leave, police told a news conference broadcast live on WYMT-TV's website.
College President Stephen Greiner said that at the time of the shooting, there were probably about 30 students on campus, which is based 90 miles southeast of Lexington, Ky.
Police recovered the weapon, a semiautomatic pistol, at the scene, Hazard Police Chief Minor Allen said. He said a man who walked into an office of the Kentucky State Police in Hazard and said he knew something about the shooting was being questioned as a suspect.  The man had not been charged with a crime and no other suspects had been identified at the time of the news conference, which was held about three hours after the shooting.
A male and female were already dead when police arrived about 6 p.m., Allen said. The wounded juvenile, a female, was taken to University of Kentucky Hospital, he said.
A hospital spokeswoman said she could not provide any information about the juvenile's condition without a name, which police did not release.
Police believe the shooting may have been the result of a domestic dispute, Allen said. He didn't know the relationship between the victims and the shooter.
In a statement released late Tuesday, college officials said they did not think the school was specifically targeted or that any of the people involved in the shooting were either students or employees of the college.
Conor Duff, the college's evening coordinator, said the outbreak of violence was startling.
"Everybody here's been pretty shook up," he said. "This is definitely something people around here are not used to. We have our fair share of problems, but normally this isn't one of them."
Classes had resumed Monday at the campus after the holiday break, according to the college's website, which also posted that there had been an incident and asked students to stay away from the main campus. The school called off classes for Wednesday.
The college's academic programs range from associate's degrees in arts and sciences to career-focused training in mining technology and heavy-equipment operation.

We have become so tolerant as a nation to let people do whatever they want by using excuses of mental, marital or domestic problems. It's time to stop it. You do the crime, you pay for it.

@TGarrett - Once again, well put. If I lived near you, I'd buy you a beer. You are correct: The law-abiding obey the law, the criminals don't, and the criminals always find ways to get what they want. Thus it has ever been, no matter who sits in the Oval Office, and thus shall it ever be.

"Police believe the shooting may have been the result of a domestic dispute"

That and drugs are the reason for most violent acts.

It's not about guns or the NRA, or left- or right-wingnuts that I think is our problem in the U.S. I think the problem is that we have ALLOWED extremism to become part of our accepted rhetoric. It is commonplace now to hear people in the media being disrespectful to the president and members of Congress. It's somehow OK to mimic vile, insulting and degrading references to people. We've lost our BASIC values of self-respect and respect for others. Until we regain that value, we are a country at war with ourselves.

I don't think this was a random act like Newtown. He was going to kill those people whereever he found them.

I said it before and I will say it again .... (I know its been a long time since I was in high school, 1970, or college) ..... but, when I had a disagreement with another student, we met met at recess (or lunch, or break), we fought .... we got over it, and that was usually the end of it, unless we fought again after school!   

AND, yes, I almost always had a rifle or shotgun in my car (as did most all my friends, which was parked at school behind the gym because we ALL were hunters), but NEVER, NEVER did we think of getting our gun and coming back to shoot who we fought with or others ..... 

I even had an altercation once with someone at recess, and when school was over, we left together and went hunting with high power rifles until dark...... never a thought crossing our minds about shooting each other!

Its a different mind set today.   Anyone have any comments on what I have stated? ... thanks!

This isn't a "gun shooting at a school".  This is a "domestic shooting" that just happened at a school.  Media stop putting your own twist on the news.

And this killer just had to wait until their appointed victims were at school.

Overruns are caused by runways that are too short. Simple as that. A factor of 3 must be considered to be a safe. Everything below that is a constant menace. 
But economy rules. Death of passengers isn't part of the calculation. Only technical parameters are taken into account. Those parameters are as well a result of economical issues by their very nature. Mobility is the no.1 cause of fatalities.

This is a strange argument that defines that we are not apes despite the fact that we are apes. We are primates and will forever be part of them. The fact that we are using notebooks and cell phones doesn't change our genom and our self-importance doesnt change our inheritance. Everyone who is doing research on the matter will agree on that.

The flaws of the Austrian economy theory is the reason why we Austrians are living in a social society. All economy theories are false because they're dealingwith abstract and reality-disconnected values. The value of a forest seen by economy is the price of paper and furniture. The real values of a forest are oxygen and water retension. Two things that have more value than all products made from wood.

Thats why animals are developed and man kind is retarded. The art of not thinking is truly a treasure that only a few people are practicing, like the Hopi indians and soome people from Aisa. The folks in our culture are constantly rushing from one task to the next. At the end of the day they can't even tell what they did exactly. They need technical asisstence to remember it. Their lives just pass by without them noticing it. Poor people.

Seems that people are taking theoretical physics for real, lol! If I can proove by equations, that reality doesn't exist then your equations do not exist as well. This is a good example how deluded and often insane people can become if they get stuck in their tiny theoretical bubble-world. We can be lucky that their opinon about reality is not relevant to reality at all.

The trouble with theoretical physics is that is has absolutely nothing it can rely on except fancy mathematical models. They're trying hard to make their models come true. And with enough effort its possible because math is not nature. Math is a man made symbol handling language. Math completely fails to explain anything in nature (Einstein). You have to pull constants out of thin air to make it work. Math might describe itself, but it doesn't explain anything.

I think that the discussion about probability is useless. Probability is not happening and things that happen arent probable, they happen. 
With 99.99% of the "emptyness" of matter we're still left with 0.01% which is obviously enough. The contradiction is the false assumption that matter is "solid". This is a trouble that I dont have. Matter appears to me in the right way so I can interact with it. Other appearances are not a predicate for increasing chances to survive and are therefore waste.

Its not possession or some sort of supernatural crap. If your synapses begin to fire constantly you become paranoid up to the point when you feel that everything around you is against you. After a while even your own body is a threat. This also happens to people with a pathological malfunction of the nerve system in absence of drugs. Nerves are all there is. Daemons are not neccessary. Daemons are the spawn of an ill brain anyway.

Please dont use the word marijuana and bath salt in one sentence. This is ridiculous. Nobody on weed would behave in any way abnormal. The drug problem of the west is prohibition. Synthetic drugs wouldn't be out there if you just dont prohibit the harmless natural drugs people are consuming since 300,000 years.

You should consider legalizing weed and other natural forms of drugs instead of fighting them and creating a measure/counter-measure spiral that you don't understand leave alone controlling it. Drugs are not unnatural. All animals are taking drugs once in a while. And people are animals as well.

Somehow I have the impression, that people can't stop pounding on advantages while ignoring disadvantages all along. If a police drone can watch a burgler, a burgler can as well watch the police. It's nothing but a stupid spiral that should help this shitty market to gain profits. Up to the point where people will be hit by drones falling out of the sky or colliding with aircrafts on purpose or accidentally. You people are stone cold fuck nuts. Thats what you are.

If you're in an overcrowded restaurant and you try to shoot a robber with a machine-gun, this will be as precise as launching a hellfire into a house. Obama is simply not informed about what a rocket with a warhead is. He is willing to sacrifice a dozen people to kill one person.

The belief that one can be "supreme" on the long run is an illusion. Drone technology isn't some kind of secret hi-tech. People everywhere can build those drones easily. The capacity of the rest of the world in building drones exceeds USAs capacity by a factor of 100. For each drone build in the USA 20 can be build in China or Russia. The next the USA will be facing is that drones from the enemies will roam their skies. Autarkic drones. Terminator will become a documentary.

It would be not only cheaper but also better for all, if the USA would step back from insulting the world by their self-importance and self-appointed world-police status. Threatening the world with self-declared "technological supremacy" doesn't work either. There are 1000s more geniuses outside of the USA than in the USA. Soon the USA will see foreign autarkic drones roaming their own skies and "Terminator" will become a documentary. Is this the world they want?

The Danish people are simply not afraid to change their way of living. It's interesting how conservative others are in this respect. It's very boring to see that peope are driving to their offices in a time of telecommunication. They are still living in the 19th century when "being at work" meant to be sitting on a desk visible to your boss. 70% of the people could simply work from home. This would greatly reduce the cost for assets and energy on the companies side. Why are they not doing this?

State Senate Republican Leader John McKinney politely asked the audience to hold its applause at a Wednesday hearing in Newtown, Conn., on gun-violence protection and children's safety.


Then, he introduced Newtown Police Chief Michael Kehoe. 
"I've already made my first mistake," McKinney said as the crowd erupted in applause.


Connecticut legislators had come to Newtown, the place that has ignited the nation's debate on guns.


Newtown Families March on Nation's Capital 


Almost everyone in Newtown has been directly affected by the Sandy Hook shooting. Dave Wheeler's 6-year-old son Ben was among the 20 children killed Dec. 14.


"As elected representatives, it is your job to pass the legislation that will keep your constituents safe,"  Wheeler said, calling for a database linking gun owners and those suffering from mental illness.


"The liberty of any person to own a military-style assault weapon and a high-capacity magazine and keep them in their home is second to the right of my son to his life."


Gabrielle Giffords' Emotional Plea for Senate 'Courage' on Gun Control 


Wheeler's statement was followed by applause, as well as every other statement delivered in the Newtown High School Auditorium. Although the cameras have left Newtown, this town isn't hiding from the tragedy.


Bill Sherlach, the husband of school psychologist Mary Sherlach, who died in the shooting, said he has a deep respect for the Constitution and the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms. But he called for a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines.


"Armor-piercing bullets," Sherlach said. "They're meant for one thing and one thing only. Brutally kill by penetrating even a Kevlar vest. For law enforcement and military, fine. For anyone else, one has to ask, 'Why?'"


Sherlach said school and mental health providers need to spend more time helping children and their families.


"The number of professionals have been cut while the amount of regulation has dramatically increased," he said. "This means more time doing paperwork and less helping people."


Wednesday's hearing lasted six hours and was the fourth and final meeting of a bipartisan legislative task force.


At a hearing Monday in Hartford, Conn, a parent of one of the young victims was heckled when he asked whether anyone in the room could give him a reason why they needed an assault weapon or high-capacity clip.


"The 2nd Amendment shall not be infringed," a man yelled back to Neil Heslin.


Heslin, whose son Jesse Lewis was one of the first-graders killed, spoke at Wednesday's hearing and received a standing ovation.


A few gun owners took to the podium and told their legislators that they should not be punished for the actions of one person. But they agreed with the calls for stronger gun education and better mental health testing.


The residents of Newtown have a different perspective on this tragedy than the rest of their state. They're community is forever changed regardless of what lawmakers decide to do.

Attacking to the tool instead of the person does not bring any justice or remove the crime. It's a tragedy that our media and politicians are using this horrible events to target tools instead of criminals and mentally unstable. Blaming the tool for act of violence may be the easy route, but it is not the answer. Changing constitutional rights based this theory is just wrong.

Please take the time to call, write, or email your state and federal representatives. Ruger and many others have setup nice sites simplifying this process. Let the right people hear your thoughts. Thank you.

These actions were in place when the Columbine attack happened, they will not make anyone safer, knee jerk reactions do nobody any good.

the current debate makes no sense.  just search and look up "hi-point carbine" and compare the hi-point handgun to the carbine.  EXACT same gun exact SAME magazine 10 rounds, but they are trying to say a rifle with the exact same configuration is an assault weapon because the rifle has a pistol grip when all they have done is add a longer barrel to the pistol making it much more difficult to conceal (and therefore logically SAFER).  

Add to this the fact that handguns cause over 97% of all gun murders and assault rifles cause less than 1% and the whole assault weapon ban is easy to see why they simply let the 1994 ban expire.  It's just stupid and pointless and does almost NOTHING to reduce the gun murders.

assault weapon myth

The proposal would ban the manufacture, sale or transfer of 158 specific makes and models of guns, along with any semiautomatic firearm (rifle, shotgun or handgun) that has a detachable magazine and one cosmetic feature such as a pistol grip or folding stock. The bill also prohibits a magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds.

No item falling into a banned category could be imported, and if a gun owner wanted to sell or transfer one of these, he would have to undergo a government background check. “We have done our best to craft a responsible bill to ban these ‘assault weapons’ — guns designed for military use, bought all over this country and often used for mass murder,” said Mrs. Feinstein of her ambitious proposal.

President Obama and his allies, such as Mrs. Feinstein, deliberately misuse the term “assault weapon” to confuse the public. Assault weapons are machine guns, automatic rifles that continue to fire until the trigger is released. These guns have been highly regulated since 1934 and are never used in crimes. The guns that this congressional bill targets are simply the standard semi-automatic weapons that fire one bullet with each trigger pull.

The best illustration of this deception is Mrs. Feinstein’s placing of the “Armalite M15 22LR Carbine” on her list of items that she claims have the sole purpose “to hold at the hip if possible, to spray fire to be able to kill large numbers.” This particular weapon fires a .22 long rifle cartridge, which has one-tenth the power of the standard military round and is generally suited for plinking tin cans or hunting small varmints. It simply looks like a military rifle, which fits Mrs. Feinstein’s effort to eliminate items that look scary to her.
During the marathon news conference, politicians played on emotions rather than facts. We know the new “assault weapons” ban would be useless because crime didn’t decrease during the 10 years that the 1994 ban was in effect. In the eight years Americans have been free to buy any semi-automatic rifles, gun ownership has gone up while crime has steadily declined.

According to a survey conducted in 2010 for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, 90 percent of the owners of modern sporting rifles use them for target shooting, 80 percent for home defense and 60 percent for hunting.

About 44 percent of owners are former military or law enforcement, who enjoy using a familiar rifle. The typical owner is over 35 years old, married and has some college education. These good Americans are the ones who will be affected by a ban, not the criminals who will continue to use whatever they want.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid should bring this measure to a floor vote soon so it can quickly be shot down.

None of the children was killed with an assault rifle.  Why are they banning something that was not even used?

Some cannot stop blaming a tool for an action that was taken by the individual welding that tool. Reality is the individual is responsible for his or her actions.

It's kind of funny when people solution for guns violence is do ” NOTHING " or enforce the present laws.. When Republicans have passed legislations making the ATF completely useless, in the name of freedom and personal choice, the very choice they are not willing to give gays and lesbian.

There is no such thing as gun control. The government only wants gun ownership for an elite few."

It's time for sensible gun control like banning large clips, assault weapons, hand guns & background checks.  If the NRA refuses to be part of the solution then they'll continue to be part of the problem.

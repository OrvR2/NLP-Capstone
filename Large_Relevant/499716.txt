see there is a couple of decent laws in RBE approach but the enforcement is unmentioned besides common good/ collectivist survival. but today's system is all raped cause there's a lot of lazy,stupid and/or evil ppl.there's also many who see corruption on top and just want to trash the whole thing and put a new one in place,ofc they won't do it cause they're lazy,they want it put in place by others, that's why they do not think about fixing stuff but replacing stuff. like a brain dead consumer. ﻿

sigh. "laws" go from physics, to the bible, thru most associations of people, to government, and up to your RBE. it depends on the set of laws and﻿ it's enforcement to create a balance, not many people we know of break the laws of physics cause the enforcer is basicly the universe. many people break the laws of humans because the enforcers are lazy or brainwashed and can write laws too. but i individually free do not obey corrupt laws, but i keep laws my heart tell me are good for all justice

Redneck? Jesus christ, listen to this guy! If I started talking about physics without any actual knowledge of it, would you point me in the right direction for where to start? You're one angry guy, and I'm very happy you lost everything twice because you are mistaking gambling with capitalism! :D Good luck have fun dude! Read some Mises, you might not lose all your money again!﻿

You don't care. You don't care what my background is or what my experience is. So shut the fuck up you pissy little redneck. My guess is I was using my capital when your﻿ mother was still wiping your butt. Don't pretend to be doing me or anyone here any favors. Your a self centered prick like the rest of us who wants to promote his own self importance. Shut UP!

Agreed, in a perfect world only certified experts would open their mouth. ﻿ Sigh. As I told another, I have no alternative so I'm a willing capitalist - when I don't loose it all playing capitalist (twice now, thank you). No, I have no experience, or reason to comment intelligently. Thank you for reminding me to consult with higher authorities such as yourself before I shoot my fat fucking mouth off.

On that I﻿ would shake UR hand sir. I don't have a better way so I must agree with U completely. Rigging of supplies or demand is not freedom. My hurt is when I pull back, I see we R paying 4 what was already ours, or used to be. Land was for claiming, not supporting banks. Water U got & drank, B4 there was no good water to be had without a price, & so on. To me Free NOW simply means the stronger can take from the weaker & that's "just how it is". Sigh. Pay for our sight or hearing next?

Ростите Бороды, экономте на пене, воде и шарфах.) Вкладывайте в﻿ технлогии и инструменты. Russia might change only by 2030-40/ due to Communist Slavery and Biblical reference to Deuteronomy.

Okay, point taken, it hasn't provided anything useful, and you don't need to go on expounding your credentials to me,I'm sure they are legit. What ticks me off though is when people advocate﻿ more statist regulations in their mistaken understanding that corporate or crony capitalism is the same thing as free-market capitalism, the former is what is draining the life out of this economy at the moment, the latter is what has allowed us to get to the level of prosperity when often take for granted.

indeed all the leaders of the bid industries are CCP members.﻿ and whats the point? this model works. unlike the "free market" (what is an chimera because there is no and never was and never will be a complete "free" market) i dont know why you always compare china with 40th years Italy.

Back to the topic, Deripaska is a very savvy individual - he nailed it about central banks, just look at the CV's, all academics,﻿ no experience in private banking.

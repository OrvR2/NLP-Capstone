LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister David Cameron is leading Britain into a minefield in seeking to renegotiate its terms of membership of the European Union. His gamble could easily end in a bust.
              Cameron postponed a landmark speech on Europe, due to have been delivered in Amsterdam last Friday, because of a hostage crisis in Algeria, but he had already disclosed the thrust of his plan to try to change London's relationship with the EU.
              Extracts from the undelivered speech released by his office show he planned to say Britain would "drift towards the exit" unless the EU reformed itself. That sounded reminiscent of a 1930s British newspaper headline: "Fog in the Channel, the continent cut off".
              The excerpts did not mention a referendum, which Cameron has indicated he would hold later in the decade after negotiating a "new settlement" with Europe.
              His strategy is bound to open a prolonged period of uncertainty in which events could put his preferred option -- a looser version of full British membership -- out of reach.
              First, all Britain's 26 partners must be willing to negotiate on Cameron's agenda, which despite some expressions of goodwill is by no means a given. Euro zone states may prefer to press ahead with closer integration without reopening the EU treaties, or refuse to unravel past agreements.
              Second, they would have to be confident in the prime minister's ability to win a national vote and make an agreement stick over the long term to justify significant concessions. But many EU officials are not convinced Cameron's Conservatives will win a 2015 general election. There is no incentive to give him more than polite sympathy until then.
              Third, EU partners would have to be able to win the consent of their own voters or parliaments for any special deal with Britain that could involve watering down European social and employment rights and giving London a lock on EU financial services legislation.
              Many are worried that an a-la-carte Europe would lead other countries to demand opt-outs.
              Finally, the whole process must proceed free from the kind of unpredictable clashes, political accidents or media scares that have dogged London's ties with the EU for decades.
              No rational gambler would bet on all those stars staying aligned. Despite Cameron's declared intention of keeping Britain in Europe, you don't have to be an astrologer to see how this could end in divorce.
              Britain has renegotiated its terms twice since it joined the European Economic Community in 1973, yet it remains a reluctant, semi-detached and often obstructive member.
              Prime Minister Harold Wilson won some cosmetic trade concessions that were endorsed in a 1975 referendum on staying in. Margaret Thatcher secured a large, permanent annual rebate on London's EU budget contribution in 1984, which remains a source of resentment for many partners to this day.
              Despite obtaining opt-outs from Europe's single currency and the Schengen zone of passport-free travel, the British public and Conservative politicians have turned ever more hostile to the EU, depicted in much of the British media as a malevolent, meddling foreign bureaucracy.
              With the exception of a couple of short-lived honeymoons during the construction of the European single market in the mid-1980s and the launch of a European security and defence policy in the late 1990s, relations have always been fraught.
              It is hard to recall that 15 years ago, Prime Minister Tony Blair was publicly proclaiming his intention to lead Britain into the euro as soon as economic conditions were right.
              For most of the time, successive British governments have fought tooth-and-nail to thwart or slow moves towards "ever closer union", the goal enshrined in EU treaties since 1957.
              No wonder that despite their leaders' public pledges of support for keeping Britain in, many European officials and diplomats privately wonder if the EU would not be more united and freer to advance if the British could be managed out.
              "There's a feeling that it might be best to use the next inter-governmental conference (on EU treaty reform) to organise the UK's exit," a French official said, speaking anonymously because he was expressing a personal view.
              Former European Commission President Jacques Delors, who clashed frequently with Thatcher, has suggested publicly Britain should leave the Union and be offered "a different form of partnership" based on the European Economic Area.
              Officially, no EU government takes that line. But imagine some of the events that could intervene to change the game.
              What if the UK Independence Party, which advocates complete withdrawal, were to win next year's European Parliament elections in Britain or outpoll Cameron's Conservatives despite his renegotiation and referendum pledge?
              That could force the prime minister to ratchet up demands to repatriate powers from Brussels to lure back anti-EU protest voters in the 2015 general election. It could also undermine EU partners' belief that any concessions would be sufficient to secure a "yes" vote in Britain.
              If, confounding opinion polls, Scotland votes to leave the United Kingdom in a referendum next year, where would that leave the more Eurosceptical English?
              Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has said Scotland would want to stay in the EU, but Brussels lawyers say a seceding Edinburgh would likely have to apply from scratch, negotiate membership terms and win unanimous acceptance to join.
              Other factors could intervene to complicate negotiations.
              A dispute over mad cow disease in Britain in 1996 caused a crisis between London and its partners, with the British boycotting EU business for months in anger at a ban on beef exports to the continent.
              Now, Britain may clash with Brussels over tighter financial regulation sought by the euro zone countries.
              Another serious risk is that public expectations of change in Britain's EU membership terms grow unrealistically high and the deal that Cameron is able to negotiate is dismissed by Eurosceptical politicians and media as a sham or a joke.
              Even if none of these landmines is detonated, there remains the strong possibility that voters given the first choice in a generation to vote "no" to the European Union choose to do so.
              Experience with referendums in France, the Netherlands and Ireland shows voters may cast a protest vote against an unpopular government, or simply express a general dislike of Europe, regardless of the question they are asked.

Isn't this typical of the EU's apologists.  We're bankrupt and stale and we may drag you down too, but you must stay with us because change is unthinkable.  

This kind of idiotic "preserve the beast at any cost" thinking is what has grown the EU from a simple concept of reduced trade barriers to a behemoth that would regulate every second of your day - from the size of chicken claws to how many peas are optimal in a toddler's diet.  

All of this occurs courtesy of an unaccountable bureaucracy - the mysterious "Brussels" - from which all knowledge and good originates, brought to you by bureaucrats who will never have to answer to a single voter.  

The EU needs extreme reformation.  It cannot be a nation-state.  It can only ever be a free-trade zone.  The further it strays from its origin, the worse it will be.  

But not of course for the author of this article, for whom rejecting a bureaucracy must be the ultimate unspeakable act.  

Give me a break.  Spare us all from bloated, unaccountable government.  It's "We the People," not "You the Bureaucrat."

Amputations without anaesthetic would be unthinkable now but they were accepted as the norm once. Would we go back to those days? Of course not. There may never be a better time to think the unthinkable as they put it and get out of the EU whilst we still have a country left.

Renegotiation is very unlikely to work. Several treaties will need renegotiation and they are of course treaties with all other 26 EU members any one of which can refuse. What would be much more likely to work is an EU exit by Britain but with a deal such as Norway has. Norway is not an EU member but has special privileges with the EU as a fellow European country.

David Cameron either does not understand the anti EU mood of the British people ; or he is trying to do a balancing act between the people and financial and corporate Britain .  Repatriation of laws , changing Britain's relationship with the EU , may give the impression of wanting to stay within the EU .
It is not going to satisfy the Eurosceptic majority of British voters who want OUT .
There is little doubt that negotiations with Brussels and other member states would be difficult , drawn out and ultimately likely to fail .  Cameron may be playing for time , but the 2015 general election is his deadline . My guess and that of others in Europe , is that without an IN/OUT referendum , or sure promise of one , Cameron will not win the general election , making all his promises hot air .  The British people vote quite differently in the EU parliamentary elections , so there is quite a possibility of the UKIP taking first place , beating the conservatives .
Delors is right Britain should leave the EU and negotiate a simple trading agreement .  Politicians and mainland residents talk of the British press creating the Euroscepticism , the people ARE the Eurosceptics , the press merely fanning the flames to sell newspapers .

He is  just looking out for Britain and its people , The EU cost way too much money to maintain and Britain is paying more than its fair share. Return on investment is almost non existent, frankly, he does not have faith in those money wasting do nothing politicians there in Brussels

The Brits live up to their reputation as independent, if somewhat quirky, individuals. God bless 'em!

The European Union has gone into deep ideologically inclined economic policies that could bring the Union down or at least prolong the recession, Mr. Cameron is doing the best for Britain and the British people by disassociating with falling policies. The trickle-down economics of the Europen Union "causa finita est" it must be a change that would not be going to happen by austerity measures and budget restrictions, nor by installing more institutional control only, the problems are structural for the economies...,

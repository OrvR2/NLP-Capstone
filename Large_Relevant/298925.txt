JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel is advancing a plan to invest in places it considers part of its national heritage, including nine West Bank sites, the government said Monday in an announcement that could appeal to hard-line voters a week ahead of elections. It triggered an angry Palestinian response.
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Tzvi Hauser said Israel is adding handicapped access to the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a sensitive site in the West Bank city of Hebron sacred to both Jews and Muslims.
The U.S. objected to Israel's initial 2010 announcement that it would label the shrine an Israeli heritage site, charging it impeded peace efforts. Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli troops in Hebron then, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas warned the move could spark a religious war.
Nour Odeh, a spokeswoman for the Palestinian Authority, called on the international community to condemn the latest Israeli announcement.
"The Tomb of the Patriarchs is a Palestinian site, and the Palestinian Authority is the only one in charge of making any changes to it," Odeh said Monday.
With elections set for next week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears likely to win another term, but his party has been losing seats to a hard-line religious-nationalist faction. The timing of the announcement hinted that he was trying to win back his traditional hawkish voters.
Hauser said Israel has an obligation to renovate the sites, and it is not related to politics.
"You can't change history. Many sites of the Bible took place in Judea and Samaria," said Hauser, using the biblical term for the West Bank. "As long as we're in the territory, it's our national and human moral obligation to take care of and preserve these sites."
Other plans include renovating the West Bank site of Tel Shilo, where Jewish tradition holds the Israelite tabernacle once stood, and possibly building a replica of the tomb of King Herod at the Herodion, a hilltop site near the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Archeologists believe it was the burial site of the Jewish proxy ruler who controlled the Holy Land under imperial Roman occupation two millennia ago.
Under the program, Israel has budgeted about $107 million to invest in about 300 cultural sites and other ventures, including renovating Israeli archaeological sites, digitizing archives and building a museum dedicated to famed physicist Albert Einstein.
Later Monday, a Palestinian farmer in northern Gaza was shot dead by Israeli troops, according to Palestinian medical official Ashraf al-Kidra. He said the 22-year-old farmer was working in the field when he was shot.
The Israeli military said in initial investigation disclosed it was not behind the shooting.

Funny how the "hard line" religious party members are always in favor of armed conflict, but they do not have to serve in the militairy that wages those conflicts.

Usurpation means that a person unjustly seizes the property or right of another person. This is one of the major sins and one who commits it will be subjected to severe chastisement on the Day of Judgement. It has been reported from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) "that whoever usurps one span of another's land, seven layers of that land will be put round his neck like a yoke on the Day of Judgement". 

The Arabs came into Eretz Israel in 638, took Jewish land, Jewish holy sites, and claimed the Jewish Biblical matriarchs and patriarchs for themselves. Islam is nothing but a usurping religion!

" If I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. It is true God promised it to us, but how could that interest them? Our God is not theirs. There has been Anti-Semitism, the N@zis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country. Why would they accept that?"
[First Israeli Prime Minister DAVID BEN GURION. Quoted by Nahum Goldmann in Le Paraddoxe Juif (The Ju-ish Paradox), pp. 121-122.]

"Ju-ish villages were built in the place of Arab villages. You do not even know the names of these Arab villages, and I don't blame you because geography books no longer exist, not only do the books not exist, .The Arab villages are not there either. Nahal arose in the place of Mahlul; Kibbutz Gvat in the place of Jibat; Kibbutz Sarid in the place of Huneifis; and Kfar Yehushu'a in the place of Tal al Shuman. There is not one single place that did not have a former Arab population."
[GENERAL MOSHE DAYAN'S address to the Technion, Haifa (as Quoted in Ha'aretz, April 4, 1969]

"A voluntary reconciliation with the Arabs is out of the question either now or in the future. If you wish to colonize a land in which people are already living, you must provide a garrison for the land, or find some rich man or benefactor who will provide a garrison on your behalf. Or else-or else, give up your colonization, for without an armed force which will render physically impossible any attempt to destroy or prevent this colonization, colonization is impossible, not difficult, not dangerous, but IMPOSSIBLE!... Zionism is a colonization adventure and therefore it stands or falls by the question of armed force. It is important... to speak Hebrew, but, unfortunately, it is even more important to be able to shoot - or else I am through with playing at colonizing."
[VLADIMIR JABOTINSKY, founder of Revisionist Zionism (precursor of Likud), The Iron Wall, 1923.]

Who said this?

"Terrorism is a way of fighting that is acceptable under certain conditions and by certain movements." 
Former PM Yitzhak Shamir quoted by Ju-ish author, Robert Friedman, in the introduction to his book, Zealots for Zion, page xxxii.

The rest of the statement, Shamir added that while terrorism was appropriate for Jews fighting for their homeland, it is not for Palestinians who 'are fighting for land that is not theirs. This is the land of the people of Israel'."

Some Ju-ish historians have put at 40 as the number of Jus the Irgun and Stern Gang murdered to settle personal accounts. Apparently, this too was within Shamir's rights as a "freedom fighter" and does not constitute terrorism or murder.

I suspect that the victims' families might feel differently.

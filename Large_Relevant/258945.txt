As an act of pure evil it was difficult to match.
After dragging the 8-year-old by her hair across a schoolyard, the killer put a 9 mm pistol to the girl's head and pulled the trigger.
The gun jammed. So he took out a Colt .45 and finished her.
She was one of four victims. The others — a 30-year-old rabbi and his two boys.
As the gunman had targeted a Jewish school and the bullets were identical to those used in the murders of two North African soldiers and one black soldier, suspicion fell on some neo-Nazi racist.
And in France's tight presidential campaign, left and center moved swiftly to exploit the atrocities by charging the French right with creating an atmosphere in which such racist horrors can occur.
"Killings Could Stall Election's Nationalist Turn," ran the New York Times headline. The debate over whether the murders were "inspired by anti-immigrant political talk is likely to continue," wrote the Times' Steve Erlanger, "both as a weapon in the presidential campaign and as a more general soul-searching about the nature of France."
French President Nicolas Sarkozy was thrown on the defensive.
These murders, said centrist candidate Francois Bayrou, "because of their origin, of the religion of their family," are linked "to a growing climate of intolerance."
Politicians "have the duty to make sure that tensions, passions, hatred should not be kept alive at every moment. To point the finger at one or another according to their origins is to inflame passions, and we do it because in that flame there are votes to get."
The massacre at the Jewish school and the murders of Muslim and black soldiers, said the head of France's Council of Muslim Democrats, "are a strong signal sent to politicians and, more particularly, to those who, for several months, have played with fire."
And who had "played with fire"?
Sarkozy and Marine Le Pen, candidate of the rightist National Front.
Sarkozy has been toughening his stance on immigration and national identity. In a March 7 debate, he said that there are "too many foreigners" in France and that assimilation is "working worse and worse."
He pledged to cut immigration in half.
Last summer, Sarkozy sought to deport Gypsies who had overstayed their visas. In echo of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he has called multiculturalism a failure.
He has spoken of revising the Schengen agreement, which lets residents of the European Union travel freely across borders. He has denounced burqas and facial veils worn by Muslim women. Boys and girls, he says, should swim together, a practice intolerable to devout Muslims.
With his rightward move to siphon votes from Le Pen, Sarkozy had surged into a tie with Socialist Francois Hollande.
So it was that the left leapt with alacrity upon the massacre to charge that Sarkozy's new populism had created the climate in which such horrors against Jews and Muslims can occur.
So it was that the Times concluded that the nationalist turn in French politics might be halted, as it had in Norway after berserker Anders Breivik slaughtered scores of children last year.
What was happening should be readily recognizable to Americans.
When John F. Kennedy was assassinated by a Marxist in Dallas, the Goldwater right was charged with creating an atmosphere of hate that had made it likelier to happen there. When Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot by a crazed gunman who wounded a dozen others and slaughtered six, moral responsibility was laid at the feet of Sarah Palin.
Unfortunately for the French left, however, by Wednesday, the mass murderer had been identified as a homegrown Salafist jihadi and self-styled member of al-Qaida who had spent time in Afghanistan and Pakistan and been under surveillance for years by French intelligence.
Mohamed Merah was seeking revenge against Jews for the deaths of Palestinian children and against French soldiers for fighting in Afghanistan.
Le Pen seized on the news to blast the left, which had sought to blame the atrocities on her, and charged the French government with underestimating the Islamist threat and being lax on national security.
"It is time to wage war on these fundamentalist political religious groups who are killing our children," she said.
"The threat of Islamic fundamentalism has been underestimated. ... (I) have been talking about this for months and months, and the political class has rejected (me). Some are going to have difficulty explaining themselves, but I have a clear conscience."
With the killer precisely the type of individual the French right has said bears watching, Bayrou was hastily backtracking:
Politicians must "tackle the risk of importing into French society conflicts that are foreign to us or should be foreign to us."
As Europe's native citizens age and die and immigration goes on and on — with 5 million Muslims already in France — issues of national identity will bedevil Europe, even as they will bedevil us, forever.
In Toulouse we see clearly now not only the dark side of diversity but perhaps the future of the West.

I'm waiting for the other shoe store to drop on the heads of those "fearless" radical muslims currently fortunate enough to live in Western societies.  Like it or not, if weak governments cannot protect their citizens, then don't be surprised when private citizens start handing out "private justice."

Chapter 17 of Machiavelli's "The Prince" states it is "much safer to be feared than loved."

I'm sure they're was someone praising  diversity at the tower of Babel, when what you really had was chaos.Pat has been right about this for years , diversity of culture and race brings only division and conflict, thats  not my opinion or Pats, but the judgement of history.

Pat raises an interesting question, but this piece is badly written. I rambling around without any clear direction. It was so pedantic that I couldn't read it all and just skimmed the last paragraphs.

If Pat doesn't do better, his readership is going to dwindle.

I both agree and disagree with Pat's argument here.  I agree that, without fail, politicians and the national media jump to conclusions that line up with their biases or political goals.  They end up being wrong more often than not.

But I reject the idea that these particular killings can be laid at the feet of "inflammatory rhetoric","multiculturalism", or a "climate of hate".  The only thing that all of these tragedies have in common is the mental instability of the one who did the killing.  

A rational human does not systematically murder children- or express their political views by opening fire on a crowd.  These killers are not rational actors, and the responsibility for their actions lies wholly with them.

I don't think a political speaker can be held responsible for what a deranged person does with their message.  I don't believe multiculturalism, in and of itself, leads otherwise sane men down this path.

A diversity of beliefs leads to chaos. As we turn away from God, the CHRISTIAN God, and only true God, Jesus Christ, this country will see hell. Look at what we have as a prtesident. If that doesn't concern you, you need to wake up.

The bad thing, the other bad thing that is, is that we too often do not rid ourselves of those that perform violent acts like this. Take for instance the guy in Norway that murdered so many folks. He is still alive after all this time. To what purpose" The kid that shot Reagan is nearly free to walk the streets. To what purpose? We slap those that perform these dirty deeds lightly on the back of their hand and allow them to live, thus showing the world that violent and murderous individuals have nothing to fear really. If they can make it past the crime without being killed by police authorities, they have it made. Free meals, room, medical care, sex, drugs. Nearly anything they could wish for, except having to atone to society for their violent behavior. As for Pat's original premise. I too believe that racial diversity is a terrible curse.

Looks like Pat just 'phoned in' this one, as he has nothing really to say until the last couple lines, and what do we get?  The same old 'diversity is scary' nonsense, as if diversity issues in EUROPE (where they actually HAVE ethnic nationalities to try to protect and worry about) has anything to do with the US (which nothing BUT a big collection of different ethnic nationalities, and pretty much has always BEEN that way).  Here's ANOTHER tip; while there may be 'five million Muslims' in France, France has an OVERALL population of over 65 million, so frankly, the 'threat' of either ethnic or religious 'takeover' is more than a bit ludicrous.  And here's ANOTHER tip; France has been a immigration destination for oppressed people from all over the world for the best part of a hundred years, to include (surprise, surprise!) BLACK people from the US, escaping from the bigotry and racism of people like Pat Buchanan since WW1!  Go look up 'Demographics of France' and LEARN something!

The whacko who shot Giffords was a Marxist, just like the IRS plane crasher, Oswald, and most terrorists in the world.

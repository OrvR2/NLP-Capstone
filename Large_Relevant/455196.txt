Seeing this on RT proves to me it was made up﻿ and not true, however when i turn to real media like Fox news and Al-Jazeera i see the same news segment and it is true because no way Fox and Al-Jazeera would like to me.

The same naive men who today believe that they have found in Stalin the genius who will pull their chestnuts out of the fire for them,will live to see,perhaps sooner than they anticipate,﻿ how the spirits summoned from the underworld will strangle them, and that in their own countries.

It is due above﻿ all to bourgeois politicians not having the foggiest idea about things, when in so many countries people act as though they believed that the Jewish-plutocratic west would defeat the Jewish-Bolshevik east. On the contrary, the Jewish-Bolshevik east will one day relieve Jewry in the west of necessity of continuing to be hypocritical. With complete candor, it can then announce its actual objectives. The Jewish democracy of the west will eventually lead to Bolshevism.

The lead singer of﻿ the band playing at that moment lit a flare in the scenario that opened a lot of fireworks. The explosions hit the roof and quickly igniting soundproofing material. From that moment, the flames began to spread and highly toxic smoke caused widespread panic on the premises. Security prevented the departure of the people thinking they were going to leave without paying and it turns out that disco was not licensed to operate.
It's the fault of these victims? You're sick!

Yeah, and you'd think there'd be more than one exit door. But in Brazil, a lot of things that on paper are supposed to happen, in reality don't. 100 bucks to the safety inspector and you're good for another year. Bring Kevlar if you plan on visiting, and﻿ never assume anything/place is "up to code".

there was only one door to escape, breathing hot air and smoke leads to a fast faint, in﻿ less than a minute for most people. With the rush and adrenaline, the effects could have been even worse.

Fire started around 2 am when one of the members of the band that was playing on stage fired a firework into the ceiling, igniting the soundproofing. The club had no sprinkler system, the fire spread﻿ quickly. There was only one exit door, which was initially kept locked by security as they had instructions to do so whenever a "commotion" (i.e. fight) starts. By the time they realized it was a fire, panic had set into the crowd.1 in 5 people in the nightclub died, 90% from smoke inhalation.

Well, the club owner's last name is "Spohr", which is of German origin, not surprising since Southern Brazil was the focus of German immigration in that country, hopefully that will extinguish any more zionist comments, but who﻿ knows with those peopole.

Could have sworn the Egyptian rioting was﻿ comprised of regular Egyptians who are upset with their corrupt government, as well as the shitty economic outlook for the country's foreseeable future.

Why? I can put it on a circle, square still means nothing. Again can you not count, it is 11 points vs 6 point. Tell me you are not that stupid that you cannot figure out the difference between the two. I have faith that you are smarter then that. Trying to﻿ compare the two again and saying they are the same just shows everyone your intelligence level. Either you admit they are different and you are smart or they are the same and you are not smart, balls in your court.

No, it was greedy banksters who knew full well the people they were making loans to couldn't ever pay them back, but that was what﻿ the banksters wanted because they make much more money overall on foreclosures, than on mortgages that get paid off.

I wasn't that line "then I wouldn't have any﻿ debt" pissed me off as stupid people making loans they can't pay back caused our economic crisis. Those in debt are parasites that need﻿ to be sent to prison labor camps until they can pay off their debt.

Oh I can when it's obviously the typical mindset in America.
I don't see hoards of Americans mobbing through Washington D.C. to demand this evil empire stop being an evil empire.
That﻿ means the vast majority of the 320 million Americans condone their evil government's activities by default.

Oh my god, now there is more dead from this one fire than all of the US shootings combined. We need to all get together and BAN FIRE worldwide! It is used by﻿ madmen, and is clearly unsafe in the hands of civilians. There is no possible way we will be able to maintain a society if people have fire.﻿

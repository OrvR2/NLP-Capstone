I had recently taught my daughter the meaning of "haberdasher" and "apiary" (along with words like apothecary). We were both excited to hear you use both in theďťż same sentence.

Eeeeexcept when Obama is a total fucknugget who now wants the entire US budget be given to him, somethingďťż that is explicitly stated as unconstitutional. I don't know about you, but this shows his intentions rather clearly.

After months of research on this topic, I came to the conclusion than the Federal Reserve essentially creates money out of thin air and then lends in to the government on interest, thusďťż creating perpetual debt. Here's an animated video explaining it better:

1. Didn't you watch the video, or stay awake in your high school Civics class? There is literally no decision Obama can make that has the slightest impact on the debt without putting itďťż through Congress. The closest he can manage is drafting legislation and having someone propose it.
2. Just letting you know, using 'Hussein' without his first name suggests that you might be a bit racist.

No. This explanation is flawed. It is indeed about lending more to be able to pay bills. Whether that money is used to pay the dude that is paving or has paved the road, or whether you want to feed cockroaches withďťż it does not change a thing: there is no more money needed to pay a bill. So you say: raise the credit limit on my credit card. I don't care what the fuck you think you can get away with by manipulating terms. Bottom line is: USA is broke. Bankrupt. ZZZ rating.

I understand what you mean. However, that logic is flawed. If anything, because a "buffer" indicates a "spare". Which cannot be. You cannot have a useful spare "nothing". Let alone the fact that any moron (except politicians, since we'll be paying for them and their mistakes while the banksters line their pockets because of that) understandsďťż that more lending will always bring about more problems if you aren't able to pay off the first debt in the first place. Now... what the financial and govt.

sectors are doing is fcking with your mind by presenting bullshit, done by people with a big salary, in a nice suit, lotsďťż of social status (unjust) so you will open wide and swallow instead of protest and refuse like you should as a people. Debt is not a given. If that would be (is) an accepted norm, that would prove how rotten the system actually is. Only an all out war will be able to solve the problem, by throwing the world back into the stone ages.

I agree that our country's ability to print money is being exploited by many in Wall Street, by policy makers, and lobbyists alike. But this buffer is absolutely necessary. Without it our budget will be locked into EXACTLY how much tax comes in, and we will not be able to make futureďťż planning. Planning for growth also stimulates growth, so its good for the economy for us to make a budget ahead of time that is slightly larger than the current year. There are many problems that need fixing but..>

to say that having a debt IN OF ITSELF is the cause is not true. So if we work on our ability as citizens to change and affect economy policy is practiced (mostly through our votes but alsoďťż by pro-active involvement in local politics) to reduce how much influence "wall street" has on our politicians that would be much more worthwhile thing to do than to just hate that we have debt.

They didnt widdle it down, they simply proposed Obama's budget as an amendment AS IS. Theďťż Hill News- "The White House sought to provide cover for Democrats to vote against the Obama budget resolution before the vote, arguing the resolution offered by Sen. Jeff Sessions was different from Obamaâs budget because it did not include policy report language. But the bill was virtually the same". Either way, this youtube video is very misleading at best.

They didn't "widdle" it down? Jeff Sessions deleted practically all of the policy text from the president's budget and just left the numbers. That's as whittled down as he could have made it!
You can look up the resolution: S.Con.Res. 41 (112th) If you are reading news that said that was the president's plan you should do your brainďťż a favor and never get news from there again. The policy language is the difference between spending the Energy budget on solar research or fart power.

If anyone pays attention at all to anything that happens these days. Obama actually tried to push things through. Congress has rejected a lot of Obama's bills, that were request to spend MORE. The the Democrats and their supporters blame the Republicans for the "lack of cooperation". Forcing the Republicans to let Obama have his way. Yeah, Obama is the exception to some of these facts. I have notďťż seen congress pass much of anything spending without a fight in the last 4 years.

True, but you made this video in 2013 because this is a hot topic issue between congress and Obama. It feels as though you favor Obama from your tone or you are trying to explain it is not Obama's fault as most ppl think. Obama might not be 100% to blame but he is involved. I do not think that congress has been the only party stalling until the very last moment. Obama seems to have spent more time campaigning and doing other things than working onďťż this. Congress is also not free from fault. Thx

Biased people don't want to hear that Obama isn't perfect. I allow your opinion so why are you so mad that I believe this post is pro-obama? Shouldn't make any difference to you if you are unbiased and respect my opinion. I stated that both parties are to blame . I believe both congress, Obama, Dems, and Rep are all toďťż blame by doing this last minute. The "President" is not a faultless party in Congressional politics and decision making. But I appreciate your opinion.

I'm "mad" (though I'm not, you sure love projecting emotions onto me and putting things in my mouth) because I'm tired of people abusing the term "bias" to mean things they disagree with. The video never says Obama isn't to blame. CGP Grey is very consistent in his videos and blogs, blaming the system for the ridiculousness that goes on in the U.S. government. By the way some peopleďťż throw around the word "bias", you'd have to be a comatose vegetable to qualify as unbiased.

The PRC (No such country as "China") bought 6% of US national debt, and since the US has a net-worth of 75 trillion dollars, and a gross worth of well over 300 trillion with an annual GDP of 16.2 trillion, it will take a lot more than 390 billion annual private investments and PRC banks holding 1.52 trillion to "own" a country our size.

Well, I do respect that you watched the video if not the detail. The np/mag example was ONLYďťż judging the price of newspapers and magazines. It was aďťż way of proof reading the accuracy of individual products. He wasn't determining prices of EVERYTHING. Only paper media. You must admit that should at least call question as to the accuracy of the CPI. noone does
He picked 20 items at random (Listeners randomly select items). They weren't cherry picked. which is why he compared those items to 1970s

I realize what he was trying to do with the magazine example. He chose 10 that were popular today and compared them to their price 10 years ago and said this showed that the magazine/newspaper price used in CPI wasďťż wrong. In other words he failed to show that it was wrong.
20 items is not a significant enough sample size, and what you described is nowhere near random. Refer to the Billion Price Project which shows that the CPI is very accurate. And yeah, I would trust the BPP more than CPI.

China does not own us.ďťż Yes, we have massive debt to China, but the US is als the number one consumer of Chinese goods. China could demand payment from the US, which would destroy our economy, but in response we could just as easily boycott their products, effectively destroying their economy as well.

No, they can't "demand payment" from us. Our debt is paid in installments just like every other debt, Have a mortgage? Student debt? They can't just askďťż you to pay all that at once because you both signed a contract that you'd pay it in sections. What we are required to do is pay the service on our debt, which we reliably do every year and is a relatively small part of the budget that we'll likely be able to pay for quite some time.

I thinkďťż he means they can "call in" the bonds, especially if they are short term t bills.

Yeah, I was sort of simplifying it. I know that China couldn't demand payment, but the US does still have to pay off those debts in orderďťż to retain international trust.

Most debt has acceleration clauses, whereby the entirety of the debt becomes payable immediately in case of certain events. One such even is anďťż event of default, such as if you miss a payment, but most contracts also allow for the lender to call in the loan if it believes that payment of the complete debt may be hindered or unlikely to happen, due to something as simple as the financial behavior/situation of the borrower. I deal with such agreements every day, so yeah, you're wrong.

Guess what? Country-wide debt is significantly different than personal debt, so please drop the condescension. In the modern world, accelerations clauses are rarely, if ever, invoked,ďťż and never for large countries, like the USA.

We wouldn't even need to boycott Chinese products. Remember that bit about how so much of the global economy relies on the dollar being reliable? That includes the Chinese economy, so if it looks like the US is in the slightest danger of defaulting on the debt, China is going to cooperate withďťż pretty much everyone else to make sure we don't. It's not so much a stalemate as both sides playing against the gameboard.

Sadly, its because of the inefficiency of our government (plus the lack of direct representation and calling for action that we require) that makes people give up on the system. The only real people who do participate, are people like you who still feel they can make a difference through a slip of paper, and those who benefit from it (i.e. the Obamadrones that love his food stamp, welfare, and Obamacare help, but choose to not serve the nationďťż or at least provide equal help).

The state, as any other institution, needs to pay it back its loans eventually, with interest. The state has to borrow from the market, and the market will soon realize that there isn't a chance in the world they'll get their money back, the US (and any other western country) is bankrupt. Then governmentsďťż won't be able to borrow anymore, and things will become quite interesting as the world realizes Greece isn't one-of-a-kind.

In âOccupying Chairliftsâ a simple rule tweak on inheritance ends up changing the direction andďťż purpose of modern human life! Hereâs a fair way to transition forward to where weâre rewarded for cooperating and creating instead of competing and conquering.
It's something specific we can demand. If this isnt the best answer, at least weâre thinking about what might be. Are we really just this close to having it work right?

First, inflation will always be an estimate, and we make that estimate by monitoring the prices of a commodity basket. Second, I'm sure there are a huge number of different baskets to choose and that some of those will be higher than CPI.
That doesn'tďťż matter. The important figure is increases and decreases in inflation, AND ALMOST EVERY BASKET YOU CHOOSE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CPI in that measure. Try the MIT Billion Price Project which uses the largest basket I know of. (cont)

Governmentsďťż collapse before their currency, meaning, the Weimar Republic lost a major war and agreed to pay huge sums in reparations in hard currency. The government was done at that point and only made it worse when they started buying foreign currency with their fiat currency - essentially creating their own hyperinflation machine. When the US does all of that, I'll be worried with you.
While Schiff isn't incorrect, he is being extremely dishonest with his numbers (cont).

whoops. Spending. But tying it to the debt celing is stupid. The majority of the budget is continuing expenditures. It's money already allocated or spent. Really just.look at what happened last time. Is spending billions extra in interest fiscally conservative? You have.to cut spending before it'sďťż spent.

He said "from their point of view the debt limit is awesome". He never said he thinks it's awesome or thinks not having it would be awesome, Grey just explains how it works and why it serves congresses interests. This isn't a video on "explaining what to do about the debt limit", it'sďťż a video on explaining what it is.
You get an F for listening.

bandroidx, you have touched on one of the most blatant bits of conservative propaganda to ever be run through the media. I have read countless misleading headlines like "President to Use Executive Orders and Push For Assault Weapons Ban." First, the president's memos on gun control were "actions" not "orders." He has the authority to set policy for departments in the executive branch.
None of his actions had anything toďťż do with the AWB.

You need to re-read what I wrote. I did not mention any past actions including his "actions". I said that people think that if the AWB fails congress, he has theďťż ability to ban them with an Executive Order, which to my understanding is incorrect. A video on Executive Orders would be very intriguing to many, guns or not.

I said that I think thatďťż people incorrectly believe the president can create an AWB with an executive order because of media fear mongering implying that he has or is trying to. I wasn't putting any words in your mouth or misreading what you wrote. I also wasn't saying there shouldn't be a video about executive orders.

whatďťż the video doesn't mention is where the money is coming from, and why we are in debt. I don't mean to bash on the video, but the United States CAN'T NOT be in debt. Even if Congress was able to balance the budget. The amount of money the United States has borrowed from the Federal Reserve to maintain the economy, which the Fed charges interest on, is the reason why the US will ALWAYS be in a circle of debt. Some say, for this reason, we should switch to backing our money with gold.

Why dont you explain why the Federal reserve is privately owned and loans us money on interest... and that we are so far in debt to them that they own us... how about making a videoďťż about that instead of this transparent Obama worship video?

And by that reasoning, you should never have to pay taxes. Those IOU's issued by the government can be produced infinitely with nothing to back it up.Oh, wait, you say they ARE backed up, by your labor and capacity to pay taxes? Then tell me, do you haveďťż an infinite capacity to labor? Can you pay infinite taxes? It can only be one, not both: either money is limitless, so no need for taxes, or you are a SLAVE who backs that debt, and YOU are the limit. Have you reached your limit yet?

Money is metaphysical in the sense that value needs to beďťż attached to it. That value comes from people wanting it. When the value of money goes down there is too much inflation. Collecting taxes keep value of money up because that money is being parted by people who really dont want to. That is more effective at giving that money value than if we just printed IOU's.

As I see it, your argument against current debt follows two fallacies: the straw man andďťż the slippery slope fallacy. First, thereâs the assumption that we want to keep debt high or that it will always be high (the straw man), or (the slippery slope fallacy) that weâre just totally approaching our red line on debt! Itâs not true, weâve had higher levels of debt to GDP in America, so the idea isnât played out in facts.

Where was Austrian economics before 2009? You love trying to take the high ground now, but when times were great nobody was willing to question the excesses of the credit boom. But that's the point: no-one cares about the debt when times are good, all we need is growth and soon people will again forget about this austerity nonsense. Not only will severeďťż cuts choke growth, but people forget that it was the austerity of the '80s which gave us this huge social welfare bill in the first place.

Well duh, the problem is what to spend moneyďťż on how much to spend and how much tax to collect and how to collect it. Everyone wants the government to be balanced but nobody can agree on what to cut.

Ifďťż congress allowed that, the president would seem like the good guy, the want the president to be the bad guy so people spend more time trying to find a new, good president, and less time finding new, good congressmen

the thing is a nations debt (especially the US) isn't like household debt.ďťż A number of reasons mean that it doesn't matter hugely if they spend more than they take in (no-ones going to let them default anytime soon), obviously its not desirable but perhaps the welfare programs, health, aid, education etc which they money goes towards are more important in the opinion of whatever president is sitting at the time

This is the laughable. It has a few elements of truth, like all good lies, but overall it is government propaganda. First, congress hasn't passed a budget in over 4 years, so thereďťż are no "orders" from congress on where to spend money. You would think this would tie the hands of the president, but not if you have Obama, he just spends what he wants and calls all opposition racists. Oh, and all government leaders have to have borrowing approved. If you believe this guy, I have a bridge 4 sale.

How about we leave the debt limit where it is and then they have to live within their means. This video is government propaganda and your tax dollars are paying for this nonsense. No one with a brain believes aďťż word of it. Obama even voted against raising it when he was a Senator. Probably the only good thing he ever did. Now he is destroying us from the inside on purpose. This video is a diversionary tactic, and not a very good one, unless you are in grade school.

That is called a veto my friend. It was first abused in the way that you mention by Andrew Jackson, by vetoing legislation because he considered it wrong, not because it was unconstitutional. However, Congress can override a veto with a two-thirds majority. If Congress always benefits,ďťż just about all of them will vote on vetoing anything the president does (That means more than two-thirds). I'm sorry, I didn't realize you knew more about the working of my country. Vetoing only delays progress.

Let us not forgetďťż to mention by raising the debt ceiling you also make the value of the dollar less which in turn causes inflation of every thing you buy.

We need debt. Otherwise the expenditure of the government will be locked into EXACTLY how much revenue we have,ďťż and on top of that we won't be able to make a budget until we know how much money we got. This is extremely inconvenient. The FED provides people to lend money, but its real money that people get a interest rate back on. The FED provides this purpose.

Its basic economics. I just explained it. It acts as aďťż buffer. Kind of like an overhead to a company. I agree that buffer is being exploited and overused, however national debt is necessary. Its not an oxymoron like "war is peace". You are thinking too much in terms of personal debt, as if you are imagining yourself doing what we as a country does. Its not the same thing. Every nation has some king of buffer like this.

If we had no national debt, that means that we have to wait till all the taxes are in, and only then can we plan what we want to spend this on. It is impossible, when you are dealing with the figures on a national scale. We need to go on and make plans based on an estimate, or projected growth if we will, and start planning the expenditure on thatďťż basis. To deal with the unavoidable error we have debt.

I think if every president went on trial after his 4 years was up nďťż faced prison time, we would have alot less bushes and obamas and alot more JFK's or even Clinton wasnt tooo bad, he got head and alowed dieing people to smoke weed so he did a few good things :P but I strongly believe if all presidents faced trial, there be alot less bribes stupid wars all these problems we have would vanish after the 1st shitty president got life in prison no perole or the death penelty, Bush should be tried!

This video is wrong in so many levels I don't even know where to begin. It is based on the premise that you never, ever, have to pay for anything, you just print more money. Think about it. It promotesďťż endless spending, for anything the government wants (new wars included), without ever having to pay the old expenditures. Your taxes become irrelevant in such a scheme. Maybe we should just abolish taxes then, why take money from the people at all if you can just raise the debt limit to infinity?

No. There's a clear political bias inďťż his "explanation", so he is doing more than that.

By "explain", you mean spin a purposeful deception to justify more deficit spending.
Got it.
Contrary to his Democrat blather, it is the crushing debt burden, and its growth, that's the "weapon of financial mass destruction"; NOT the limit placed on it, which the government keeps violating.ďťż

When you add up all the US households who take more from the public money stream than they contribute in taxes and such, they grew to be the majority under Obama.
Habituated dependents want their fix. Until they're bitch-slapped back to reality, arithmetic will remain irrelevant to them.
The horror is this next Fannie Meltdown will include the Federal Reserve Bank itself. There isn't enough moneyďťż on Earth to bail us out. ETA is 2016 or so. Look to Japanese YEN for the precursor.

Obama is on his way to Vegas soon to see Elvis and talk "authoritatively" about "Immigration Reform".His mafia bosses tell him what to say. In the end they will push amnesty for "undocumented workers" (read illegal aliens-cheaper replacements) and don't worry about "enough money" they'll just print more until they decide to pull the plug, which without serious outrage to stop their gun control scheme (read planned mass slaughter of citizens) we will be very soon too late to saveďťż what remains..

I'm not sure I understand your criticism.
Refusing to raise the debt ceiling would create more financial harm thanďťż the current debt.
For example, when the whole debate over the debt ceiling happened last time, our credit rating dropped. That's never happened before.
On the other hand, we've had the debt for a longer time.
I'm not saying the debt is ok - but the refusing to raise the debt ceiling isn't the answer because that's just political manipulation. Congress playing games as always.

So what is the answer? Just continuing to let them borrow and borrow and borrow?
You doďťż realize that it's YOUR money they're borrowing... right? And your kids' money. And your grandchildren's money.
Congress is NOT playing games... they are trying to protect the people from the insane spending of the current administration. You should be thankful that someone is actually standing up for you and your hard-earned cash.

Refusing to borrow more money causes neither "financial harm" nor credit downgrade. What does causes both is SPENDING more than you make, especially so when you continue to spend at that UNSUSTAINABLE rate even after slamming into your credit limit.
I'd say "do the math", but it's merely arithmetic.
The spending bit is never mentioned because the careers of political hustlers are built on obligatingďťż others to the debts generated by promising evermore free stuff to their dependent voting blocs.

But it DOES cause financial harm. Because its borrowingďťż money to pay back to, for example, employees of the government. How isn't it financially harmful to basically default on your employees?
I'm NOT advocating increasing government debt.
But refusing to raise the debt ceiling is not "making a stand" against spending. Like the video points out, you're borrowing to pay for the things you've already done, not for FUTURE payments.
Either way the debate can't cause any good?

"pay âŚ [gov't] employees" --if payroll is larger than revenues, then payroll must be cut. (That's NOT a "default".)
"the things you've already done" --that amounts to service payments on debt; a (growing) FRACTION of spending. Thus, no default can occur unless it's by purposeful refusal to pay, which can't occur, and is illegal.
Instead of smoke & mirrors to peddle mythologies, try arithmetic. The same kind used to balance a check book, if you have one. Else, askďťż your parents about that.

I was using payrolls as anďťż example. With regards to the US budget, the largest expenditures would be military and social security.
If you want to "eliminate deficit spending", you would probably have to cut down on either (if not both) of those. Whether you should or not is definitely more complicated then a "check book".
But either way, that's NOT the issue here. A debate over the debt ceiling is Washington politics. It can't solve the "debt crisis". That was the point of this video, no?

Your "facts" are wrong. Defense is less than 18% of the budget, and doesn't make the top 2 list.
Beyond that, I can't explain the simple concept ofďťż debt limits and their arithmetic any simpler than I already have, so I can't help you here.

First, those percentages are misleading. You want to compare that to how much taxes we get right? Well for the 2011 year, Defense was close to half of how much revenue the government got. So....yeah it's pretty important.
It sounds like you're advocating spending less...and yes that would lower the amount of times you would have to raise the debt ceiling. I think that's a terrific idea.
But when you have to raise the debt ceiling...you have to. Literally the government is mandatedďťż by law.

Speaking of "misleading", your facts are wrong again. In 2011, as in 2012, DOD spending as a percent of tax revenues was less than a third; less than that of HHS entitlement spending; less than that of SS entitlement spending.
What I'm "advocating" is a basic grasp of economics & politics. It is NOT "mandated by law" that spending exceed revenues. So, the gov't does NOT "have to" obligate usďťż to more of their debts. That is, the gov't does NOT "have to" VIOLATE their last debt ceiling.

I'm not sure what figures you have but even ifďťż you are right - when DoD, HHS, and SS all spend almost a third each, there isn't anything left over in the budget.
I know its not mandated to have spending exceed revenues. But if we had the decision to either:
1. raise the debt ceiling or
2. not pay on our financial obligations
the first option is best. Even if we're in the process of reducing the deficit/spending/etc.
Whether deficit spending is good or bad is not the purpose of this video.

That isďťż actually too late at that step. If we need to raise the debt ceiling, that means Congress already passed a budget that has a deficit.
So even if you want to do that, you have to raise it first, then balance the next years budget.
And the whole balance the budget thing is a really touchy issue and not the focus of this video.

This video acts like the debt ceiling doesn't matter, which is completely wrong. Ratings agencies and investors are worried about our growing debt. Raising the ceiling time after time doesn't give the market confidence we have the will to ever balance the budget. If Congress refuses to pass a reasonable budget then the free money they want won't be there. Big fucking deal. ďťż Just means the government will have to make cuts and live within its means. Markets would love it. Don't buy the hype

Well to be fair two things:
1. the rating agencies and market confidence was only shaken up after the debt ceiling debates. But that didn't affect the interest rates on our debt in aďťż negative way.
2. But technically raising the debt ceiling (now) doesn't prevent them from passing a balanced budget (later). But they DO have to pass it now.
Again, the whole budget thing really isn't a part of this video. It barely even mentions if it is good or bad - why does it have to?

But if that was true then you might as well make the video about the whole debt crisis - which this isn't. O.o?
If by the whole picture you mean the US economy.
But yeah things should turn out fine. Most countries aren't afraid of US defaulting and maybe this time around the ceiling debates won'tďťż breakdown as much.

It should mention the budget because the debt ceiling was put in place to prevent congress from out of control spending vis a vis The Budget. The video brushes the entire topic to the side as though it is irrelevant and claims the only reason we have a debt ceiling is "because politics". That's Bullshitďťż and the author only points to the partisan bickering to make his case without addressing the real reasons for having a limit to our national debt. This is what pisses me off. Empty rhetoric.

He does mentionďťż the budget - he mentions how the government has to borrow when it spends more than it gets. He just doesn't criticize deficit spending like you want him to. He does not advocate removing the debt ceiling. The only thing he has a stance on is the debates (and the time it takes) to raise the debt ceiling.
That's good - a stance on all those other issues would be distracting from learning about the debt ceiling itself. When he wants, he can have a separate video for those issues.

By the way, there areďťż many other videos that describe in detail the deficit and the effects of deficit spending. Wouldn't this discussion be better on those types of videos?
Throughout our talk, I've really been stressing only one point: this video isn't meant to discuss whether deficit spending is good or bad.
Merely Congress normally spends more than it gets, but doesn't want to raise the debt ceiling without using political games.

Now you're wrong about your own posts.
Your first reply was a rewording of the video's false claim; its perfect inversion of reality; the claim that limiting debt is "financial harm", asďťż you put it. You were responding to my post that points to the idiocy of such false claims:
"
Contrary to his Democrat blather, it is the crushing debt burden, and its growth, that's the "weapon of financial mass destruction"; NOT the limit placed on it, which the government keeps violating.

No limiting debt isn't the financial harm.ďťż The idea is that the Debt Limit aka Debt Ceiling HAS to be raised when we have borrowed too much money.
To NOT raise it in that case WOULD be financial harm.
Whether anything else is a financial harm (or not) shouldn't be covered in this 4 min video.
This video isn't advocating that we should spend more than we get or debt is a non-issue. It explains the Debt Limit/Ceiling and what the debates actually ARE: politicians being politicians.

"Has to be raised when we have borrowed too much"
That statement is nonsensical. It also nullifies your claim regarding the debt limit.
There is no word play in the world that can mask the lunacy of claiming that a debt limit is a "weapon of financial mass destruction". Yet that lunacy is the explicit claim of this video. Worse, it proselytizes the notion, as do you, that our unsustainable spending is some kind of good. Such is the result ofďťż either abject ignorance or depravity.

O.o?
Let's de-couple the "spending is bad" from "the debt limit".
Congress spends too much? President borrows money to make up for it. Eventually, the debt ceiling is hit from repeated borrowing, and in that case, the debt limit SHOULD be raised.
Now, the idea is thatďťż only Congress can do that - therefore when they spent months debating about it like LAST time, that's using it as a weapon.
Yes this whole thing can be stopped if we didn't spend as much...but that's not the point here.

"President borrows money to makeďťż up for it"
I don't mean to sound mean, but you keep communicating your economic and political illiteracy, and even your inability to grasp the financial meanings of your own posts in this thread.
Whatever has made you so impervious to reality, neither it nor anything else will protect you from the toxic effects of this Hopey-Changey Spending-Borrowing Show. So, even if you are a net taker from the tax stream, this will end badly for you too.

Okay I'm approaching this issue completely devoid of politics and merely assessing the framework.
Does the President, and this particular President, have no say over the budget? That would probably be false.
But in a purely academic discussion of the debt ceiling, the only reason why there are debt ceiling debates is Politics.
You seem to be arguing something...else.
Again I thinkďťż it would be more profitable for both of us if we could talk...through email?
Either way, please enlighten me.

Wait is there another way we can have this really interesting discussion?
YouTube commentary is a little sparse with 500 word character limits.
Anyway, I still believe that arguments about the validity/viability of spending SHOULD be posted on a more appropriate video. Do you really feel that a 4 min video ABSOLUTELY has to coverďťż spending?
You seem to be accusing that this video is trying to mask the problem of spending by deflecting blame onto the debt ceiling. I don't think that's true.

So your argument is that the debt ceiling has nothing to do with the ethics of debt? Whyďťż the hell do you think the limit on national debt was created in the first place? Oh, right - "because politics". What a load of crap.

Yes, but withoutďťż discussing the ethics of debt, his quick summary of the debt crisis as "leverage" is hollow; it can only lead most viewers to believe that Congress is merely interested in political hostage-taking, not fiscal responsibility. He conveniently left that out. Omitting aspects of truth is the same as telling lies, without telling lies.

There's not reason to collect taxes then, since they've become irrelevant. If debt can be increased to infinity, why take the people's money? When learning contract law we were taught this about I.O.U's: you need to establish a timetable for repayment, and a penalty for missing it, otherwise the person who owes can simply forever pushďťż the payment date into the future. This video makes it sound like having unpaid IOUs is great, but eventually nobody wants do to business with people like that.

what kind of bullshit this ? are you kidding me?ďťż yes, at this point in time it is necessary to raise the debt ceiling, but you completely neglect to mention the fact that continuing to pile up debt is a bad thing... instead you suggest that the only reason for opposition to raising a debt ceiling is politics, and trying to make the president look bad.... not the fact that we need a budget overhaul and to cut spending drastically......

Did you even listen? Congress sets the budget... Which means they knew they would need to raise the ceiling, but still they hold off toďťż the last moment.

the only reason he gives for possible opposition to the debt ceiling, isďťż trying to make the president look bad and politics, currently the gop is holding out on the debt ceiling because they want some SERIOUS cuts made, it has nothing to do with politics or making the president look bad, thats my point

So,ďťż you are saying that because they need serious cuts made it isn't politics? That makes no sense. It's still furthering an agenda via leverage and manipulation, which is, as they say, "politics as usual."

The debt limit just adds a final round for congress to rehash battles that theyďťż already settled. If they want serious cuts they can introduce bills that do it or stop introducing pork into federal bills.
That would be more akin to a representative democracy than a minority party stopping the whole show until they get concessions.

If we cut government spending, or at least went back to true federalism, we wouldn't be having these problems.ďťż It's not the people in Congress, it the perverted system, signed off by the courts.

After 30 seconds, I can tell you this video is a product right-wing coordinator. Really? The President is in charge of federal spending? Congress collects and uses our taxes on issues they deem fit. The Executive position merely passes/vetoes said action. Oh yeah,ďťż and before I forget, the Federal budget is comprised of every Dept of Congress. Whether or not its in coordination with the President, its the Depts decision.

This is an oversimplified one sided version of the story. The other side is that Congress is responsible for the budget and tries to maintain balance.ďťż However, the President and his self appointed finance cabinet likes to bully Congress and spend recklessly on his personal favorite projects. The Constitution does not give him this authority directly. It does give this authority to Congress, though.

The US dollar is not legal. It's a fiat currency. The US constitution says only gold andďťż silver are money. Around 1790 the Spanish milled dollar was widely used in America. It was 371 1/4 grains of silver. That was the basis of the US dollar. That has all changed and now our dollar is worth whatever the banks say it's worth by expanding or contracting the supply. It's a fraud. To learn more watch Edwin Vieira on YouTube. He's an expert on money.

That is the reason your country borrows money. Because it's full of dumb-arses who can't utilise their own language in the correct manner. 3rd world migrants have a better grasp of the english language than a high proportion of Amerca's youth.
I'll do you a favour though and will explain it to you, in the hopes that you stop being a sheep.

Generally speaking, if you are doing 'good', you do not need to borrow money right? America is a broke ass motherfucker.
Once upon a time Americans made stuff. They sold this overseas and within the USA. Real products were made, and money was coming in from selling them.
Thenďťż Americans stopped making stuff, and bought it from poor countries instead, which meant that they paid less at the store.

Now Americans aren't making much at all. And they'reďťż having to buy everything from other countries, because they no longer make it at home. But they don't have the money to buy it either. So they borrow.
Meanwhile, Americans also want to be dictators of the world. 156 countries hold US troops. 63 have US military bases. Donald Rumsfeld 'lost' 2.3 trillion on 9/10/01 before all the evidence was wiped off the map on 9/11/01. Being a giant bully costs a shitload of money you see.

America's economy is based on skewed figures, banking schemes (derivatives, hedge funds, etc), and other bullshit in general. The US government borrows from the Federal Reserve (a private bank, not part of the government) and these loans have interest on them. How doďťż you pay the interest? Borrow more money.
The entire system is flawed and depends on constant growth. When your economy is not growing, it is doing bad. But how can it 'grow' forever? It can't.

What they are doing now is delaying the problem. If they admit the problem, the entire system will collapse. If they mint trillion dollar coins in an act of desperation, they only delay the problem forďťż shorter and shorter amounts of time, and make it way bigger down the road. I can't wait till the US implodes myself.

Today's economiesďťż are based on fiat currencies and the shifting of goods & said currencies, regardless of what real world impact this has. As long as there is 'activity' at an increasing rate, it's all good.
The capitalist way needs to stop. Profit-driven businesses need to end. People need to hold their government accountable. Americans need to stop trying to control the world, both militarily and economically.
This can't happen unless the American people unite in a revolution.

It seems to me that a large part of the capitalist way is okay. China for instance seems to be improving the living standard of its subjects as a result of doing moreďťż capitalism, and having profit driven businesses.
I agree that fiat currencies (a rather new invention?) are being abused big-time.
I agree that Americans need to stop trying to control the world.
I am not sure what sort of revolution the American people might unite in.
Communist? Nah. Been there done that. It does not work.

The Americans dont need a reason to spontaneously grab a gun and shoot people. So why would they need a reason to revolt? Its the same thing, in the end.
/crap joke.
In honesty, a... "Revolution" wouldnt do jack shit. Revolutions generaly (Read: Allways) have been about changing the seats of power. Holding a revolution to fix a economy is just... impossible. Its like trying to fix a poppedďťż balloon with a screwdriver. Its a completely pointless solution to a problem you cant fix.

I'd be inclined to agree.
I am not sure what Americans might aim for via revolution. Big statist communism is not going to roll. So, libertarian Ron Paulism? Iike RP but itďťż sounds like where they (US Americans) came from. They tried that and it did not work(?)
Wild wild West? Every MAAAN for himself and his gun? Yeah, sounds cool but...as I say, wasn't that where Americans started out?
A conservative revolution. "We need to get back to the Wild West, man?"

I think that the family is the root of our society. If one wants to have a revolution then it, the family, might be disbanded. The commies attempted it with big government but we know that does not work (in the US at least)
All marriages could be made non-legal, no tax breaks, nothing marital under the law.
Further a new system of free market sexuality might be provided so that women that sold their bodies be given badges, chips, tokens that enable themďťż to pay for education and babysitters.

I have been dreaming that the family might be replaced by radical Ron Paulist (more so than he) "kickstarter" radically free market system, whereby all women become prostitutes equipped with a kickstarter type page/account for their potential babies. All sexual relations would be encouraged to be accompanied by funding for future offspring so that there would be no sexual monopolies or cartles (marriage) at all.ďťż

Imagine each dollar is worth 100 'points', and there are 100ďťż dollars in the economy. 1000 points total. Then all of a sudden the government triples the amount of money available in only 8 years. Is everyone richer? No, this means that each dollar is now really worth around 33 'points'. Because there are more dollars, each is worth less individually. Compared to other currencies, the dollar is worth less points which means you have to spend more dollars to import the products i mentioned earlier

This video neglects to mention that Congress hasn't passed a budget in nearly four years. So the statement that Congress (which was majority Democrat when Obama first took office) is unfairlyďťż blaming POTUS for reneging on required budgetary expenditures is absurd. Considering there is no budget, it is disingenuous to claim that more debt is needed to cover spending, when Congress has not provided the amount that needs to be spent.

I don't know about you, but I never get lost when I look for a place to go. Why is that? My phone. No one plans to be homeless. With a phone the homeless can call to find a homeless shelter, be able to contact family,ďťż be contacted for employment by employers that specialize in hiring homeless individuals. Are you still willing to deprive them of this capacity?

A cell phone isn't necessary to do any of those things. It can make them a littleďťż bit easier, but that's just it, cell phones are a luxury, not a necessity. The way I see it government aid should keep you alive, not comfortable. If you want to have luxury items then you're going to need to work for them. I mean hell, I can't even afford some of these phones the government is giving out, why should my tax money go to provide someone else with something I can't even afford myself?

I certainly am. Before phones people were able to do this and it cost the country nothing. There's also videos on here of a womanďťż standing outside a distribution center with 30 phones in her purse. All of them were free to her. I'm also opposed to the amount of foreign aid we give out. We borrow 46 cents of every dollar we spend. It has to stop. Useless programs HAVE TO GO!

Wow, you really don't know your stuff. Foreign Aid accounts to approx. 1% of the entire USAďťż Budget. That money is used to protect investments and interests abroad. And less of that 1% is used for humanitarian aid that literally saves millions of lives across the planet. Either you are a douchbag or completely clueless of how the US conducts its foreign policies and the reasons behind each action.

I don't buy what this is implying, that the president somehow is never to blame for reckless or unnecessary spending, and we know this just isn't true. This issue isn't the 'debt ceiling', it all the waste fraud and abuse committed against the taxpayers by a bloated and spend happy government. Lest we forget the ongoing pointless war on 'terror', and the bailouts, both automaker and banks(too big to fail, oy verh!), the multiple 'stimulus's which were a band aids at best, andďťż cash for clunjkers

"The debt limit is a kind of financial weapon of mass destruction"
So, we'll go broke unless they obligate us to more debt? Thank the teachers' labor union for the economic illiteracy needed believe this load of crap.
It's the crushing debt burden, which the governing class keep growing and obligating us to, that is the "financial weapon of mass destruction".
NOT the limit that was placedďťż on it, a law which they keep violating.

we need to stop spending, whether that be in the executive or legeslative branch, it has to stop. ďťż if you think for one second that it's totally fine to raise the debt cieling, you lack a basic understanding of economics. thats like saying "we don't have anymore money, we've spent it on food,shelter,drugs,guns,flashy clothes, and cars, so i could either sell some things, OR get ANOTHER credit card. is it ok to get another credit card? it's simple economics it works on our level and gov't. level

thats a definite no. the pres. proposes certain TAX hikes that cannot be refused. and he does that by not calling it a tax. the new obamacare mandate is paid for by robbing medicare, and fudging it into other expanded forms of revenue so that they didn't have to call it a tax. ďťż therefore it didn't have to be approved by congress. thats the kind of bullshit that the obama admin. is feeding us. OH and gov't. officials are exempt from the individual mandate, cuz they know it sux

Obama blames congress for spending money people keep forgetting it's him that pushes the over spending. This liberal climate is going to turn this country into old Russia before it's over with or even China. There is a socialist agenda on this administration. People are calling with common senseďťż crazy but its liberalism that will be the down fall of this country. Continue to ne brainwashed if you want but I will stick to being an American and not a socialist.

[1] he claims "the debt limit has nothing to do with additional debt". Wrong. The 14th amendment is clear as to what is considered "EXISTING DEBT"...the house and senate are INCLUDING automaticďťż contract renewals + FY roll overs as "existing" debt...and NOT INCLUDING interest incurred for "debt financing" (which accounts for nearly HALF...43%....of the overage).
[2] the "appearance" here is that we need to just "slightly" move up the limit. $1.0 TRILLION is NOT SLIGHTLY. That is a train wreck.

Especially when you fail at it.

Then perhaps you don't know why the Constitution is designed the way it is. This guy is basically saying the Congress should have no say on it and that once the president approves, they should just trust him. I like the fact that none of your reply actually contained any academic value, just brainless attempts to insultďťż me. I should go back to school? Perhaps you should heed your own advice.

this guy isnt basically saying anything. he is saying exactly what he said and you are just making your own guessesďťż between the lines that dont exist. he is just saying how the system works. the way i understood the video was that congress makes decisions and if they are bad, they can blame the president, because it seems like a lot of amercans think the president is the reason why the economy is in the shit...

Yeah sure, I would be guessing between the lines if I wasn't preparing to take an exam about the constitution and the American government right before watching this video.
Academically speaking, if you don't want to be criticized do not make biased sentences. Fromďťż what he said so far, he has already demonized the congress, and painted the president as the victim in the scenario. There is no victim in he legislative process, they are all trying to pass their own agendas.

I don't understand what you mean. He's clearly describing the present situation which would make the President, yes, a Democrat.
For the record, I didn't like the near-identical policies of the Bush Administration, either, so Iďťż don't have the luxury of only having been through eight years of bad leadership by the end of Mr. Obama's second term--I get sixteen.

Supposing RAISING TAXES and CUTTING SPENDING are more or less equally effective at generating revenue, why would you not give precedent to the latter? Raising taxes takes money away from the individual citizen, who knows far better how to improve his/her own well-being than the government through its programs. The choice seems clear.ďťż Something's fishy about your polemics here, Grey.

Keep in mind we are still paying for WW2 today. Look it up. They need to dissolve the credit unions for the people, do away with the income tax as a direct tax on income is unconstitutionalďťż and actually against the law. Taxes on other items and services is what pays for essential services and is more than enough there are thousands of other taxes to pay for it. Their gambling with money that isn't theres and no one cares.

if we went back to the gold standard, did away with the income tax, as it's unconstitutional and only spendďťż on essential services. It's common sense, you only spend what you take in. People will scream that we NEED the income tax. We don't. That's what all the other taxes are for. Taxes on goods and services pay for essential services, not your income tax. The government should only be obligated to spend on such essential services, police, fire, defense. That's it.

The gold standard will not solve the problem, it's the unwillingness of Congress to control spending, andďťż in NO case will they vote to keep say, one ounce of gold at a constant amount of dollars....they will simply let the number float. Also, yes, essential services, police, fire should be at the STATE and LOCAL level.

okay, to understand the macro, I like to use the micro, if I spend more than what I take in I go broke, if I invest in the market I'm gambling..with my own money. No other people's money. They need to spend only the money they take in and not invest in a market that could go down with other people's money. It isn't their money, it's ours. I don'tďťż get to spend more than I take in, I spend only on what I need and maybe want I do invest but only with my surplus. As the .gov should do.

They do that partially, through stateďťż parks, federally insuring oil rigs, causing moral hazard, and capital gains and "corporate income" taxes. Taxation of capital, as well as labor, distorts investing and consumption.

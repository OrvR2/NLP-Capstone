Spot on. And for those of you who think the Romney approach is better just look at my country (UK). Our Tory government has taken the right wing Romney approach and I’m telling ya, its not working. It’s led us into a double dip recession – and it’s been the poor/vulnerable and working class who have been made to bear the brunt (whilst income tax cuts for the highest earners have left those earning over a million a year £43000 better off).

There’s no doubting the rigidity of Smarts passenger compartment – it’s a very strong structure. The problem here is deceleration. Look at how violently the car was driven back from the direction it was travelling & the head contacting the wheel through the airbag. Survival space sure - but massive G forces on occupants. In short a Smarts cabin behaves like a ridged tin can being dropped on a hard floor with an egg inside. The tin can will survive intact - but the egg inside will break.

As a child of the early 70’s looking back at this today you really get the sence that it was such a long time ago – far more so than it seemed just a decade back. Looking back in 2012  you see more than ever it as a completely different era, a different way of life and the sad realisation that so many of those who shaped the era that was our childhood are now gone or approaching old age.

A completely different sound of course but I see similarities with Paolo Nutini from 5 years back in the sense that both these artists came along with a sound that’s different to the norm and both have powerful voices and a song writing ability that belies their young age. 

Also Like Nutini,  Bugg is a refreshing ray of light in a music industry that for too long has been dominated by Xfactor and other bland ‘manufactured’ trash,

The reason he has paid more in taxes than the average person is because he is a multi millionaire enjoying a life style beyond what the average person can dream of.
Even if he paid his CORRECT share of taxes he would still enjoy a life style that others can only dream about with his millions. Don’t defend him. Its not need - It’s greed.
Interesting how so many defend somone like this yet start foaming at the mouth as soon as they hear of some pauper fiddling tax on a 3 hr a week cleaning job.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. safety regulators are nowhere near finishing an investigation into a battery fire on the Boeing Co 787 Dreamliner, a top official said on Thursday, raising the prospect of a prolonged grounding for the plane.
       Airlines have canceled hundreds of flights in the eight days since the plane was grounded, and Boeing has stopped deliveries of newly built jets.
       The full financial impact on the planemaker is still not clear. Still, Boeing shares are actually up 1.3 percent since regulators said the plane - full of high-tech innovations that are supposed to be a model for future aviation - could not fly.
       Deborah Hersman, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, made clear that investigators have found a series of "symptoms" in the battery damaged in a January 7 fire in Boston, but not the underlying cause of the problem.
       "We are early in our investigation, we have a lot of activities to undertake," Hersman told a news conference.
       "This is an unprecedented event. We are very concerned. We do not expect to see fire events on board aircraft. This is a very serious air safety concern."
       She rebuffed multiple questions on how long the investigation would take, making clear it could be weeks or more. She also would not say when the 787 would fly again, which is in the hands of the Federal Aviation Administration.
       Former NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said the briefing made it clear that the investigators had come up short in their hunt for the cause of the battery fire.
       "It's going to take them longer," he said in an interview. "Weeks, not days."
       Boeing and its regulators have said they do not know when the 787 will fly again. It has been grounded worldwide since a plane by All Nippon Airways made an emergency landing in Japan on January 16 after a battery incident, which Hersman said may or may not have been a fire.
       That emergency landing came after a fire occurred on a Japan Airlines Co Ltd 787 on the tarmac in Boston.
       Boeing was not immediately available to comment on the latest NTSB statement. France's Thales, which makes the 787 battery system, declined to comment.
       Other new planes had problems when they were introduced, but not fires, which makes this situation stand out, Rosenker said.
       "Fire is something you don't fool with," he said. "You've got to understand that, particularly given the short period of time the aircraft has been flying."
       DELAYS PERSIST
       The NTSB and its Japanese equivalent are working together on their probes, though Hersman again insisted the work was still in the early stages.
       "It is really very hard to tell at this point how long this investigation will take. We have all hands on deck," she said. "We're working as hard as we can to identify what the failure mode is here and what corrective actions need to be taken."
       The 787 program was already years behind schedule before last week's grounding, which means Boeing cannot deliver newly manufactured planes to customers.
       That means customers like United Continental Holdings Inc may have to wait even longer for planes on order. The company's United Airlines already flies six Dreamliners.
       "History teaches us that all new aircraft types have issues and the 787 is no different," United Continental Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Smisek said during the carrier's earnings conference call. "We continue to have confidence in the aircraft and in Boeing's ability to fix the issues, just as they have done on every other new aircraft model they've produced."
       Smisek said Thursday the carrier still expects to take delivery of two more 787s in the second half of the year.
       Boeing has already delivered 50 of the 787s. Around half have been in operation in Japan, but airlines in India, South America, Poland, Qatar and Ethiopia are also flying the planes, as is U.S. carrier United.
       The grounding of the Dreamliner, an advanced carbon-composite plane with a list price of $207 million, has already forced hundreds of flight cancellations worldwide.
       AIRBUS IMPACTS
       The head of Boeing's European rival Airbus said it would study the 787 Dreamliner design review and make any changes to its future A350 jetliner that may be needed as a result of the U.S. findings.
       "We believe so far we have a robust design, however we will draw the lessons from the 787," Airbus Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier told Reuters Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
       "We will look at the recommendations and guidelines of the FAA and if by chance we need to change it we have plenty of time because this aircraft, the 350, will be delivered to our first customers not before the second half of 2014 … so it is not a challenge and it is not a burden for us."
       Billed as Europe's response to the Dreamliner, the A350 is due to enter service next year using lithium-ion batteries but without the same reliance on electrical systems as the 787, something Airbus says will put less burden on the batteries.
       However, Airbus has so far declined to comment on how it would tackle a battery fire if one did break out on board.
       One industry veteran said airline customers need absolute certainty that Boeing and regulators have solved the problem.
       "You don't need details here to understand why people are terrified about the possibility of these batteries catching fire," Virginia-based consultant Loren Thompson said.

Remember the Lockheed Electra early turbo-prop? It was a new design too. Engineers failed to properly calculate the amount of wing flex needed to compensate for the twisting motion of the spinning turbine in the engines.  Result was the airliners wings began to twist and break off in flight.  The Dreamliner is a complex new concept.  I'll wait until they are sure the bugs are all out of it before I try it out.

I'm always amused by the speculations of armchair aviation/aircraft experts with such little information on which to base their speculations. Yes--I've said this before--but it still amuses me.

Airbus had tons of problems and groundings too and very little new technology.
The Dreamliner has new, cutting-edge technology. Boeing did not manufacture the batteries nor did they write the safety specifications (that's government). Boeing is losing a fortune because one product supplier sold them inferior products.

Everything about this new plane will be closely scrutinized.  All plans, records, tests, manufacturing processes, parts, etc.  It will be, by far, the safest plane for air travel on the planet after its all said and done.

First, there was no battery fire! The Battery overheated and shutdown, why would you blow it out of praportion? Second, the FAA works in a straight line and take years to decided what color shoe laces should be.But, they are required by law to move fwd with the MFG to find a safe fix to the issue. Don't believe this reporters idea that it will be a longtime coming, the fix will take only weeks.

The senate will spend the next 5 years in hearings over this. John McCain will be nominated for a daytime Emmy award for his rant which is perpetually played on every news network.

The irony is the Japanese were the first victims of their own defective  batteries.

Is the 787 the only thing that uses this exact same battery?

I hate it when engines get on fire or  quit or fires start when flying.  Yes that has happened.   I hate it when the copilot comes out and sits looking anxiously at the engine and admits things are not going well.   I never used to be afraid to fly.  But if the FCC is under-funded and not enough inspectors.....again folks.  We need government, we need to pay federal taxes and if we don't want to have the middle class crash (close call now), then we are actually going to have to push Congress to raise taxes on the very rich.   NOT those living barely in broken houses with broken cars on fixed incomes but ....the rich.

This plane has had problems all through its development and delivery schedules were delayed several times.  Maybe it's just a bad idea.  Give me a 747 any day.

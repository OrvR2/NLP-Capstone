Mohammed, born in 1965, stands accused of a slew of horrific crimes, including terrorism and murder. A statement from the U.S. Defense Department claims that Mohammed and four co-defendants are "responsible for the planning and execution of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York, Washington, D.C., and Shanksville, Pa., resulting in the killing of 2,976 people."
The specific charges include terrorism, hijacking aircraft, conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, and destruction of property in violation of the law of war.
A photograph taken of Mohammed after he was captured in 2003 was widely distributed on the Web. In the picture, Mohammed looks disheveled with messy hair and a loose-fitting T-shirt.

The Hindenburg Disaster: 75 years laterBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Fri, May 4, 2012Tweet0

On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg airship burst into flames over a New Jersey field.  75 years later, the disaster remains a source of mystery and fascination.

The Hindenburg was one of the first disasters caught on film, thanks to newsreel coverage. It had an unmistakable effect on the masses (it doomed travel by airship) and remains one of the most iconic moments of the 20th century. Reporter Herbert Morrison's reaction, "Oh, the humanity," quickly became the stuff of legend.
While the explosion was tragic and many people died, there were more survivors than you might think. Of the 97 people onboard, 36 people died (including one member of the ground crew). Despite all the attention that went into the determining the cause of the explosion, much remains a mystery.
One theory states that the Hindenburg's fabric was highly flammable. However, according to Airships.net, "scientific studies show that the Hindenburg's covering might not have been flammable at

Meghan McCain calls out Greta Van SusterenBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Fri, Apr 27, 2012Tweet0
Meghan McCain (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)
Meghan McCain isn't afraid to mix it up with fellow members of the media. The MSNBC contributor and daughter of Arizona Sen. and 2008 presidential candidate John McCain called out Fox News' Greta Van Susteren for inviting Lindsay Lohan to the White House Correspondents' Dinner.
McCain took to Twitter to convey her dismay. "Let me get this straight," she wrote. "Greta Van Susteren is bringing Lindsay Lohan to the WHC Dinner but has a moral offense to Louie C.K?"
Indeed, Van Susteren is no fan of comedian Louis C.K. Earlier this year, she wanted to boycott the Radio and Television Correspondents Association Dinner, an event that was being headlined by the comic.
On her blog, she wrote: "Another pig....and a media association has hired the pig, Louis C.K., to be their headliner for the big media dinner? Really? I am not going. I refuse to go. Everyone in the media should join me in this boycott." Louis C.K. later pulled out of the event and was replaced by Wayne Brady.

John Goodman, polo tycoon, ordered to pay $46 million to parents of manslaughter victimBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Fri, Apr 20, 2012Tweet0
John Goodman, polo tycoon
John Goodman (not the actor) has been ordered to pay $46 million to the parents of a 23-year-old man, Scott Wilson, whom Goodman killed while driving under the influence.
The case made headlines because Goodman, the founder of the International Polo Club Palm Beach, attempted to avoid paying the settlement by legally adopting his 42-year-old girlfriend, Heather Hutchins, as his daughter. Prosecuting lawyers argued that Goodman, the heir of an air conditioning fortune, was attempting to shield his substantial assets. The adoption entitled Hutchins to a third of his children's $300 million trust. Lawyers for Goodman's two biological children filed a lawsuit in response to their father's actions.
Of course, there is also a criminal case. Goodman faces up to 30 years in prison for manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident. He was found guilty last month, but Goodman's legal team is currently seeking a new trial for its client. The team alleges jury misconduct and claims that an

George Zimmerman is cooling his heels in jail, where he recently purchased a collection of items from the Seminole County jail store to help pass the time.
The Miami Herald recently tweeted a photo of a receipt from Zimmerman's $79.84 purchases that included playing cards, puzzle books, and Jolly Rancher candy.
Zimmerman also bought socks, a debit card for phone calls, Ivory soap, underwear, beef sticks, t-shirts, deodorant,  chocolate cookies, and one orange. The purchase left $41.36 on Zimmerman's account.
Zimmerman, 28, has been charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.

Gay BYU students contribute to “It Gets Better”By Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Fri, Apr 6, 2012Tweet0
The "It Gets Better" campaign continues to gain support. The latest contribution to the video series comes from gay, lesbian, and bisexual students at Brigham Young University.
The clip, which runs about nine minutes, features gay and lesbian BYU students, many of whom are members of the Mormon church. The students talk about when they knew they were gay, some of their most difficult moments, and how their lives have improved.
The goal of the project is, of course, to convince young gay people that their lives will get better. The project began as a way to help children and teens who were being bullied for their sexual orientation. Yahoo! employees have contributed a video of their own.
You can check out the BYU video below.

Charges filed against five who removed teen’s kidneyBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Fri, Apr 6, 2012Tweet0
Apple's new iPadLast year, a Chinese teen sold his kidney to raise money to buy an Apple iPad and iPhone. Now, five people, including the surgeon who conducted the operation, are being charged with "intentional injury."
According to prosecutors, the boy, who was 17 at the time of the operation, has suffered from renal deficiency, a serious medical condition in which the kidney fails to filter toxins and waste from the blood stream.

The story is steeped in both tragedy and intrigue. The boy, who has not been publicly identified, hails from one of China's poorest provinces. When his mother saw her son with a new iPad and iPhone, both highly sought in China, the son admitted that he sold his kidney to pay for them.
News of the illegal surgery first broke last year. The boy spoke to a Chinese TV station. "I wanted to buy an iPad 2, but I didn't have the money," the boy said. "When I surfed the internet I found an advert posted

Keith Olbermann sues Current TV for millionsBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Thu, Apr 5, 2012Tweet0
TMZ is reporting that fired broadcaster Keith Olbermann is suing his former employer Current TV for tens of millions of dollars. The Associated Press and CNN have also reported the suit.

Current TV has dismissed Keith Olbermann from its talk-show lineup after less than a year, Friday, March 30, 2012. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File)Olbermann, who came to Current from MSNBC less than a year ago, was fired late last week via a rather humiliating open letter from company honchos Al Gore and Joel Hyatt.  Olbermann's replacement: Eliot Spitzer.
Olbermann fired back via Twitter, and one quickly saw that this was one spat that wasn't going to go away anytime soon. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Olbermann and his attorneys contend that Current TV committed "breach of contract, sabotage and disparagement."
But the hits don't stop there.
Business Insider reports that the language in the lawsuit is "heavy on the dramatics."  One choice bit:
"After being enticed to leave MSNBC and come to Current with promises of editorial control, freedom from corporate influence, and the professional support to produce high-caliber political

Keith Olbermann fired from Current TV, replaced by Eliot SpitzerBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! NewsMike KrumboltzPostsEmailBy Mike Krumboltz, Yahoo! News | The Upshot – Fri, Mar 30, 2012Tweet0
Keith Olbermann has been fired by Current TV and has been replaced by Eliot Spitzer, previously of CNN.
Olbermann's tenure at Current lasted less than a year. Previously he had been employed at MSNBC, where his "Countdown" program ran for eight years.
In 2011, Olbermann left MSNBC for Current, but apparently things weren't going so smoothly. Current founders Al Gore and Joel Hyatt released a statement that reads:
We created Current to give voice to those Americans who refuse to rely on corporate-controlled media and are seeking an authentic progressive outlet.  We are more committed to those goals today than ever before.
Current was also founded on the values of respect, openness, collegiality, and loyalty to our viewers. Unfortunately these values are no longer reflected in our relationship with Keith Olbermann and we have ended it.
We are moving ahead by honoring Current's values.  Current has a fundamental obligation to deliver news programming with a progressive perspective that

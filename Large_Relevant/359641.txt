Black people are killing each other because 70% of them grow up in a home without a father, and mom is on the pip and or working 3 jobs to support 5 kids from 3 different men. These kids than grow up with other children in the same situation. The areas they grow up in become riddled with drugs, prostitution , and violence.

Let's stop people from shitting out kids they can't take care of instead of trying to take my gun away so I can defend myself.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of smokers could be priced out of health insurance because of tobacco penalties in President Barack Obama's health care law, according to experts who are just now teasing out the potential impact of a little-noted provision in the massive legislation.
                  
The Affordable Care Act — "Obamacare" to its detractors — allows health insurers to charge smokers buying individual policies up to 50 percent higher premiums starting next Jan. 1.
                  
For a 55-year-old smoker, the penalty could reach nearly $4,250 a year. A 60-year-old could wind up paying nearly $5,100 on top of premiums.
                  
Younger smokers could be charged lower penalties under rules proposed last fall by the Obama administration. But older smokers could face a heavy hit on their household budgets at a time in life when smoking-related illnesses tend to emerge.
                  
Workers covered on the job would be able to avoid tobacco penalties by joining smoking cessation programs, because employer plans operate under different rules. But experts say that option is not guaranteed to smokers trying to purchase coverage individually.
                  
Nearly one of every five U.S. adults smokes. That share is higher among lower-income people, who also are more likely to work in jobs that don't come with health insurance and would therefore depend on the new federal health care law. Smoking increases the risk of developing heart disease, lung problems and cancer, contributing to nearly 450,000 deaths a year.
                  
Insurers won't be allowed to charge more under the overhaul for people who are overweight, or have a health condition like a bad back or a heart that skips beats — but they can charge more if a person smokes.
                  
Starting next Jan. 1, the federal health care law will make it possible for people who can't get coverage now to buy private policies, providing tax credits to keep the premiums affordable. Although the law prohibits insurance companies from turning away the sick, the penalties for smokers could have the same effect in many cases, keeping out potentially costly patients.
                  
"We don't want to create barriers for people to get health care coverage," said California state Assemblyman Richard Pan, who is working on a law in his state that would limit insurers' ability to charge smokers more. The federal law allows states to limit or change the smoking penalty.
                  
"We want people who are smoking to get smoking cessation treatment," added Pan, a pediatrician who represents the Sacramento area.
                  
Obama administration officials declined to be interviewed for this article, but a former consumer protection regulator for the government is raising questions.
                  
"If you are an insurer and there is a group of smokers you don't want in your pool, the ones you really don't want are the ones who have been smoking for 20 or 30 years," said Karen Pollitz, an expert on individual health insurance markets with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. "You would have the flexibility to discourage them."
                  
Several provisions in the federal health care law work together to leave older smokers with a bleak set of financial options, said Pollitz, formerly deputy director of the Office of Consumer Support in the federal Health and Human Services Department.
                  
First, the law allows insurers to charge older adults up to three times as much as their youngest customers.
                  
Second, the law allows insurers to levy the full 50 percent penalty on older smokers while charging less to younger ones.
                  
And finally, government tax credits that will be available to help pay premiums cannot be used to offset the cost of penalties for smokers.
                  
Here's how the math would work:
                  
Take a hypothetical 60-year-old smoker making $35,000 a year. Estimated premiums for coverage in the new private health insurance markets under Obama's law would total $10,172. That person would be eligible for a tax credit that brings the cost down to $3,325.
                  
But the smoking penalty could add $5,086 to the cost. And since federal tax credits can't be used to offset the penalty, the smoker's total cost for health insurance would be $8,411, or 24 percent of income. That's considered unaffordable under the federal law. The numbers were estimated using the online Kaiser Health Reform Subsidy Calculator.
                  
"The effect of the smoking (penalty) allowed under the law would be that lower-income smokers could not afford health insurance," said Richard Curtis, president of the Institute for Health Policy Solutions, a nonpartisan research group that called attention to the issue with a study about the potential impact in California.
                  
In today's world, insurers can simply turn down a smoker. Under Obama's overhaul, would they actually charge the full 50 percent? After all, workplace anti-smoking programs that use penalties usually charge far less, maybe $75 or $100 a month.
                  
Robert Laszewski, a consultant who previously worked in the insurance industry, says there's a good reason to charge the maximum.
                  
"If you don't charge the 50 percent, your competitor is going to do it, and you are going to get a disproportionate share of the less-healthy older smokers," said Laszewski. "They are going to have to play defense."

Governors who reject health insurance for the poor under the federal health care overhaul could wind up in a politically awkward position on immigration: A quirk in the law means some U.S. citizens would be forced to go without coverage, while legal immigrants residing in the same state could still get it. Arizona officials called attention to the problem last week, when Brewer announced she would accept the expansion of Medicaid offered under Obama’s law. Brewer had been a leading opponent of the overhaul, and her decision got widespread attention. Budget documents cited the immigration glitch as one of her reasons.   (AP Photo/Matt York, File) AP

You mean "the Affordable Health Care Act" won't provide affordable health care?

This is ridiculous. They want to charge you more for healthcare if you smoke, but they subsidize tobacco farmers and make a killing on the taxes for purchasing tobacco. It's a bunch of #$%$, makes no sense to me. Please explain.

Let's see, we pay 2x what other countries pay for healthcare. We take 2x as many medications at a huge price premium compared to other countries. Congress forbids negotiating drug prices for medicare. No competition for insurance companies across state lines. Hospital costs are not posted so we cannot make them competitive. We do 3/4 of a trillion dollars of unneeded tests to drive profits and keep the attorneys away. Did we need Obamacare or did we just need our congress to stop selling out to the healthcare industry? By the way an ex United Health Care executive wrote a lot of this so you know they are taken care of. How about some true costs of service in places like the emergency and not the approach of the last 100 illegals did not pay so your price is inflated 10,000%. I think a couple simple laws could have prevented this disaster. Did I mention that our congress sucks?

Let's assume the hypothetical 60 year old in the article decides to quit smoking. How long does he have to be an ex-smoker before the 50% penalty goes away?

Ok, so here are his options:

1. Keep on smoking, get the government subsidies, and pay $8411 for health insurance.

2. Quit smoking, get the government subsidies, and pay $3325 for health insurance.

3. Tell Obama to shove it, and pay the tax penalty for not having health insurance. The tax penalty maxes out at 2.5%, or $875 for the old man in the article. He can go back to paying $8411 for health insurance if he gets lung cancer since the insurance companies won't be able to deny him coverage for a preexisting condition.

Obama's bean counters are ignoring option #3 when they run their numbers, but you can bet that the insurance company bean counters aren't. This is, in fact, what most people will do if they have to make a choice (i.e., they don't get employer provided health insurance coverage). They'll pay the tax when they don't need health insurance, and pay for the insurance when they get sick. This will mean the end of private health insurance in America. There is virtually no other possible outcome.

19% of Americans are smokers, more than one-third of U.S. adults (35.7%) are obese., 22 million use illegal drugs, 18 million are Alcoholics, lets punish them all so we can give healthcare to illegals.

I have ONE medical condition for which there are ONLY 2 prescription drugs available.
NEITHER is covered by Medicare; and BOTH have side effects that make them unsuitable for use due to my other medical problems.
HOWEVER, the prescription from my doctor, more than 50 years ago, does NOT have these same side effects, BUT NO DOCTOR today would give such a prescription.  it was "GO BACK TO SMOKING, IT IS LESS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH AND CHEAPER THAN THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR PROBLEM."
My problem for which smoking was prescribed you ask.  LOW blood pressure!

This is proof that when the gov starts running health care, they will get the power to enforce "health habits" on people. Smoking, soda, pizza, burgers...you get "priced out of coverage" even to a greater extent than if the health insurance was private. Slippery Slope!!!

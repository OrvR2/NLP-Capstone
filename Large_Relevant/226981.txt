EgyptAir reviews in-flight movies after Islamist complaintReuters – Thu, Jan 24, 2013

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's national airline said on Thursday it will analyze its onboard movies to make sure they respect "Egyptian values and customs", following a complaint by a Muslim Brotherhood member who took offence at a film screened during one of its flights.
 EgyptAir said the film had been turned off at the request of Ahmed Fahmy, the speaker of Egypt's upper house of parliament and a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. In a statement, EgyptAir said he had "expressed reservations about one of the scenes" in the movie.
              The statement did not name the film, but local media identified it as "Arees Mama", or "Mother's Suitor", a decades-old movie starring the Egyptian actress Nelly. Al-Masry Al-Youm, a newspaper, said Fahmy had taken offence at scenes of intimacy.
 Fahmy could not immediately be reached for comment.
              The case is likely to fuel concerns about the extent to which the Muslim Brotherhood, which propelled President Mohamed Mursi to power in an election last year, could use its new position of power to curb freedom of expression.
              Critics of a new, Islamist-tinged constitution approved by a popular referendum in December worry it gives wide scope for conservatives to limit forms of expression deemed harmful to public morals.
              Responding to media reports of a confrontation between Fahmy and the EgyptAir crew aboard Wednesday's flight from Khartoum to Cairo, the EgyptAir statement said Fahmy had asked for the film to be switched off "politely and without a row".
              "The film screening was halted in business class and there was no annoyance or objection from the passengers," it said.
              In a separate statement, EgyptAir said it would form a committee to review all films shown on its flights.
              Roshdy Zakaria, chief executive of the state-run company, said the committee would pull films it deemed "depart from Egyptian values and customs".

After complaining, the passenger went back to watching porn on his laptop.

Since when does "Muslim Brotherhood values" suddenly equate with "Egyptian values"?  There are several faiths in Egypt, not all of whom take offense at decades old movie kisses just to stir up trouble.  It irritates me when single religions and sects demand that entire nations identify with ONLY them, and then attempt to write into secular law.

Let the Islamists start their own airline.

On second thought, maybe that isn't such a good idea...

It will be happening here soon. They will cause censorship and ban many things using our own freedoms to destroy them.

As a Christian I find LOTS of movies offensive. Do you think I could get away with complaining about it and expecting anything to be done? ""The film screening was halted in business class..." I would have been told "If you don't like the movie, then don't watch the it". But because of this 1 muslin, the airline is actually forming a committee to review all films shown on its flights.
 Why are muslims treated with such kid gloves?

Egypt is quickly sinking back down into the seventh century quicksand known as Islam. It won't be long until women have lost the right to vote, own property and a host of other topics they now enjoy. That's progress for you in a Muslim nation. Let me know how that works out for all you Egyptians who voted these dominating clowns into power over your lives.

The problem with an Islamic airline is that they really don't care if the plane crashes and they all die.....In fact, they will smile the whole time regardless of what happens. You know, that crazy psychotic smile that tells you that something is very wrong.

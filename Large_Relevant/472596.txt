President Obama Slams House GOP Over Unfinished Business

President Obama is blasting lawmakers for leaving Washington for a six-week recess ahead of the November election without acting on his proposals to boost job creation and jump-start the economy.
“Without much fanfare, members of the House of Representatives banged a gavel, turned out the lights and rushed home, declaring their work finished for now,” Obama said in his weekly address. “If that frustrates you, it should – because their work isn’t finished.”
“Apparently, some members of Congress are more worried about their jobs and their paychecks this campaign season than they are about yours,” he added.
If Congress had “gotten its act together,” the president said, lawmakers would have extended tax cuts for the middle class and passed a farm bill to aid ranchers and farmers hit by natural disasters.
If Congress had “done the right thing,” Obama added, lawmakers would have created a veterans’ jobs corps to help returning troops find work and acted to help homeowners refinance at lower rates.
Instead, he said, “Republicans in Congress have dragged their feet. And now they’re gone.”
Obama urged lawmakers to listen to the needs of their constituents during the break and “come back in November and do this work.”
The president concluded by asking the public for its help.
“If you see them campaigning back home, tell them in person, because there’s been enough talk: It’s time for action,” he said.

What about “no money in the treasure chest” does he not understand.  He obviously doesn’t read the memos regarding security issues and is obviously not reading the US bank statement that is at a negative trillions.  Printing more money is not the answer and only makes ALL of this worse.  Get your head out of the sand trap Mr. President and do YOUR job for a CHANGE.

He is guilty too.  Compromise Mr. President.  They are at fault too Compromise elected officials.  There is none in Washington and it seems they don’t want to be in a hurry to do anything but blame each other.  After 4 years of do nothing they still haven’t learned the definition of this word.

May it be their last recess before being defeated in the next election.

Reids pocket veto stops any action, it won’t be there next year!  But atleast the house has bills to present, the demes just keep saying no.

Coming from a guy that’s never in Washington or on the job!!!

Obama is a pathological liar and propagandist. Except for Obama’s brain-dead Kool Aid drinkers, everyone knows that Reid is responsible for obstructing dozens of bills already passed by the House. Reid hasn’t passed a budget in 3.5 years, which is Constitutionally mandated. He’s corrupt and an enemy to taxpayers. Why isn’t he in prison?

Ironic that B.O. is finally realizing that its the economy- not clean energy, healthcare, or getting along with Muslim countries-that the country really cares about. Too little, too late, not that he cares about anything than being re elected

There’s no point in trying to improve the economy or the job market before the election.
Now if only we could obstruct Ben Bernanke…..

Does anyone actually know the facts…  Result of latest poll:  A majority of people who do not have a high school diploma vote Republican – because they don’t know what is really going-on and just watch the tv and believe all of the ridiculous ad’s…  Makes me nauseaus…




			Posted by: cu | September 22, 2012, 8:23 am 8:23 am		



It’s proof-positive the GOP is not worried about creating jobs. We need to judge Politicians by what they DO, not what they say they WILL DO.

Right now Obama will say anything he thinks people waqnt to hear to get re-elected…..instead of when you lie your nose growing……..look at those ears……….get him out of our white house and send him to the house.

Leaving town just like they did on the debt crisis. Worthless free loaders who see themselves as victims.

Don’t tell me he just submitted his proposals to boost job creation and jump-start the economy.

Obama brags for months about killing Bin Laden and allows hollywood movie producers access to classified information to make a movie praising Barack Obama. Then he fails to increase security at foreign embassays on September 11, then when news that our ambassador was missing, he continued to campaign without saying a word. When BO learns that our ambassador and three others were brutally murdered he flys to California for a fund raising event without saying a word. Next, when violent anti U. S. protests in 20 countries occurs for several days he goes on the David Letterman show to campaign without saying a word about foreign protests. Now this community organizer who has no idea what leadership is about wants to criticize congress for not doing their job. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

This guy is shameless.   All the lies and back-door dealings and he is name calling?  The latest lies about the “video” and now we (taxpayers) paid $70,000 to run ads in Pakistan to whine that we, the U.S., are innocent.  Somebody give this guy a backbone!  He is a disaster–but you liberals went for his good looks and charm over experience and wisdom.




			Posted by: jonnie | September 22, 2012, 8:37 am 8:37 am		



What was the Republican job plan?
-block the Jobs Bill and the creation of over a million jobs.  That’s getting things done Republican-style




			Posted by: plenty of time for golf in the house | September 22, 2012, 8:38 am 8:38 am		



Just more lies and propaganda from Obama. The reason Obama is bad mouthing the House is he knows that 23 democratically-held seats in the Senate are up for grabs in the November election. Thats why he is bad mouthing the House not the Senate. Our Senate hasnt passed a budget in 3 years! Astonishing. Meanwhile the Senate majority leader Harry Reid has gained a new reputation of liar because he lied about Mitt Romney and criminal who became a millionaire on a public servants salary.




			Posted by: Guess Who | September 22, 2012, 8:39 am 8:39 am		



From a president who has provided zeor leadership and a senate that is not interested in comprimise. They president can’t even get the senate to agree to pass his own budget, but continues to blame others for his lack of leadership and his failed policies of big government.




			Posted by: RICK WYNN | September 22, 2012, 8:39 am 8:39 am		



Oblamer isn’t fooling anyone anymore…The only thing that he cares about is getting re-elected so he can continue to destroy America with his twisted destructive socialistic policies and endless spending and debt.

If I win the election I’m going to get right to work giving myself another big tax cut.

President NoBo, Mr. Vote Present who hardly did anything in his short stint in the Senate is going to criticize the House which has 20+ bills sitting on Hairy Reid’s desk?
Get real!

Sorry, OB, you need to read Bob Woodward’s book. Pay particular attention to the pages which describe you as not having enough stamina to pursue your own agenda. Other pages will describe your inability to connect. So, stop brushing off your own inabilities. Try staying around the office a little more…get caught up on things. JFK learned that hard lesson after the Bay of Pigs fiasco.

What’s wrong with you commenters blaming the president?  They could’ve voted “no” if its due to lack of money.  But they didn’t!  They tucked tail and ran.  Instead of helping Americans, this strategic inactivity is inexcusable!

Ahhhh, but they work so hard.  They need more vacations and less work.  SOBs should all be thrown out on the street.

Everybody is well aware of my abilities…..running companies into debt and shipping jobs overseas while I rake in the big bucks.  But paying that huge 14% is just killing me….working Americans should understand that they should do with less so I can get that rate down.




			Posted by: mitt phoney | September 22, 2012, 8:53 am 8:53 am		



I get it now, all the right-wing nutjobs are trying to shift the blame off the Tea-Party Congress.  You’re embarrassed but we’re not that stupid.  The PEOPLE liked BO’s ideas and wanted them passed.




			Posted by: KCfatcatcool | September 22, 2012, 8:54 am 8:54 am		



THIS GUY CAN’T BE SERIOUS!  House has passed more than four dozen job-creation bills, AND a budget.  Yet his own party’s Senate hasn’t even passed a budget since he’s been in office.  And he accuses the House of “dragging its feet???”  Is this guy delusional?

This post has to deal with unfinished business in the Middle East. These concepts may help stabilize that region.
1) I believe hate is like a cancer; it can metastasize even distant cells. You have no idea where it will show up. This may explain how this cancer of hate spreads without any given pattern. In order to prevent this cancer from spreading even more, you must have healthy cells. You must reach people way before this cancer “infects” even more.
We now use precise radiation treatment to destroy the cancer cells. That may be similar to using drones. However if we create new cancer cells by our not so precise drones strikes; we may be causing more cancer of hate to spread even more.
Can our understanding of how the DNA gets an on switch that causes cancer to happen as the DNA unravels in time. Can we utilize this knowledge of how extreme hate occurs after a few generations later? In other words, it is going to take turning that on switch to an off switch to prevent future extreme hate a few generations later. These may include new economic, political and social programs to do this.
You cannot light a dark room with more darkness. You must have light to do so. Hate darkens any room; however our country should represent that shining city on a hill. That light should be that of HOPE. Now don’t get me wrong this cancer has to be eliminated; however we must find ways to keep it from spreading so fast.
From time to time your oncologist will perform tests, like P.E.T. scans, to see the progress of your cancer treatments. To weigh what should be done next. Perhaps the US could air drop thousands of smart phones, even within Iran, to see what people are saying; to see if this cancer of hate is spreading even more.
2) Should a new Middle Eastern Marshall Plan be developed to enhance peace? You have a 25 percent youth unemployment rate in the Middle East. Plus today’s forecast high is 90 degrees. If you combine the heat with high unemployment; these may be contributing to these demonstrations.
Could there be some kind of bond issue voted by the people of the Middle East to rebuild their cities; to where these bonds could be paid for by oil revenues or minerals income, as examples. This could reduce the high unemployment rate (25%) among the youth rebuilding their neighborhoods. This will keep this Cancer of Hate to spread even more. As part of rebuilding major Middle Eastern cities; they could buy new materials from the ports of the US if they so wish. Thus help lower our unemployment rate, as well. A new bold redesign of their cities could include things like new layers of walls and certain roads closures surrounding our embassies. These would make our embassies safer.
We could speak of a new Marshall Plan to give a new dawn of HOPE across the Middle East. This new light of HOPE in seemingly dark times; could be what is required to prevent this darkness of HATE to spread even more.
3) Redraw the borders between nations of the Middle East that make more sense. It was the West after WW2 that drew the borders to that of what is today. Did these borders place warring sects into the same nation? Whereas, placing new borders that separate these groups of people make more sense. The world community could design the new borders to be voted on. Perhaps some parts of Iran could be divided as well.
Create new voting opportunities that ask people; would you support a new region to become a separate nation? They could vote either yea or nay on this proposal. Then people of this region would become empowered to have a say in redrawing these borders. Some different regions of nations could merge to become 1 nation.
Just like all nations, walls with checkpoints would separate these new counties. These could help bring new security between warring sects of people.
Ask for input for how they would like to redesign their new flag to unite under. There is something magical to solute to your own flag. Perhaps leaders of these new regions of nations could design 4 flags. Then the people of a new region could vote for 1 out of 4 new flags designs to adopt.
Create new voting opportunities to ask people for a constitution and the naming of their country to unite people of a certain region. Again leaders of a region could develop 4 different constitutions and names of their countries. Then people would vote for 1 out of these 4 concepts to form their new nation.
As they say desperate times require desperate measures. Now don’t get me wrong the Cancer of Hate needs to be eliminated; however we must reach out to people before this cancer has occurred. It takes healthy cells to remain healthy to prevent this cancer to metastasize so fast. These ideas just may help to do this.  This is just an opinion.

KCFATCATCOOL:  You are reading the wrong web sites.  We the People are NOT happy with BO’s ideas, and he is an embarrassment both nationally and internationally.  Doesn’t know the debt he inherited, yet he blames the previous administration for everything; lies about the attack on the Ambassador and 3 other brave Americans being in response to a video; takes credit for the good things that happen, but never takes responsibility for the errors he’s made (and they have been plenty); unemployment over 8% for 43 straight months with a shrinking work force; and protests worldwide about him and his BRAGGING over, and over, and over about killing Osama (spike the football much?) – those are his policies that you agree with?

This two face empty suit didn’t slam anything when he had control of both houses. He was only concerned with slamming his entitlements through by any means possible. Buying votes is more important than actually being the President.

Interesting. So who does obama expect to believe him? Does he think we don’t know that the dems had control for the first part of his presidency? Does he think we are not aware that the dems hold the senate and have done zero work? Does oabam really all americans are that stupid?

@JWINATLVeterans wanted the bill…homeowners wanted the bill…MIddle class folks wanted the tax cuts…farmers and ranchers hit by drought wanted the bill…. So how is Congress representing us?  BO created twice the number of jobs as Bush.  And that’s in half the time, during the econ disaster.  PEOPLE like that.  I’m not a nut addicted to Fox news so I don’t agree with your fantasy land assessment (ie GOP propaganda) of the situation.  Most of the things you listed are untrue, and if I hear one more embarrassed republican complaining that he supposedly bragged “over and over” about Osama I just have to remind myself that their feelings are hurt because Bush gave the country a Depression while destroying a foreign country and leader for no good reason…. meanwhile the one who perpetrated the greatest attack on domestic soil went free until a Dem, BO, was in office.

Really Obama…you sound ignorant when you have been absent for 4 years and was too busy with Letterman and Jay Z guzzling $800 a bottle of champaign to even meet with Netanyhau as the middle east continues to collapse. You are a clown




			Posted by: Rafael | September 22, 2012, 9:19 am 9:19 am		



Hey Obama, if you had any leadership skills whatsoever, you should have been complaining BEFORE CONGRESS LEFT and informing the public of this.  After the fact makes it look like a cheesy campaign ploy and gives you zero credibility.  The last thing Reid did when he left was guarantee we give Pakistan more aid.  He seems to worry more about Pakistan getting money over our farmers.  Do your friggin job and lead or get out of the way.  Your campaign is crumbling about as fast as your foreign policy.

This also just in — 
The President announced today that he is strongly considering attending a Jobs Council meeting or two in the “very near” future.
He went on to state that if that seemed to go well that he would give “serious consideration” to attending intelligence briefings as well…

Why isn’t the news media holding this failed President accountable for his failed policies and leadership?  60% now have no confidence  in  the news media and the news media  is in the tank for Obama! 
President Obama lied to the American people or just completely incompetent with what went on in Libya and the Middle East.   Now your hiding that too!
Everyone should watch the new video “Voices without a Vote” on YouTube, these are kids from California…this needs to go around the country.

To me,  Obama is, with Carter, the worst president of the USA. THE America proves weak and does not proves to be the most powerful and authoritative as the world would like. Obama does not understand absolutely nothing to do with international politics and is for this  that the voters Americans must change president,voting Romney, otherwise i don’t know what will happen in the world with his re-election

If only Obama had been doing his job instead of campaigning maybe the crisis in the Middle East wouldn’t have happened!! Is only Obama has bothered to attend his daily intelligence briefings maybe we could have been more prepared since the White House had  TWO DAYS notice that something was going to happen overseas on 9/11.

they had to play golf, or go on The View, or hang out with Jay Z or go on Letterman.  Wait that’s Obama.  Man that guy has no shame to complain about Congress.  Look what HE’s promised and not delivered.  That’s the real story but we know ABC has no interest in that story.

Many times, while fishing, he would give detail after detail of how he felt Obama was destroying America.  I’ve been down a few days, have not really followed politics the last week due to being at the hospital each night, watching him lose his battle to cancer.  However, I’m back….mad as hell….lots of emotion…and I can’t BELIEVE the lies this idiot, Obama, is spewing about Mitt Romney and the liberal media is just eating it up.  As my brother-in-law always said, “America is to GREAT a nation to allow a man like Barack Obama, to destroy her!”.  In your memory, Robert, I will continue to FIGHT for America’s freedom! FIREUP, PATRIOTS, FIREUP!

heres a thought.the falling of our economy occured because the democratic policies in washington was to give home loans to high risk individuals,in other words they gave home loans to very bad credit rated citizens,these were DEMOCRATIC policies,this is the sole reason why the housing market crashed.Also you obummer supporters say obummer created more jobs than bush,hmm well lets see if your party policies are what resulted in the loss of millions of jobs wouldnt it stand to reason that jobs are easier tocreate after you made millions dissapear.Obummer suppoters claim romney didnt pay enough in taxes,well lets analize this,his money was made on capital investments which means he invested it and took a chance at losing everything unlike you whiney azzz lefties who go to work and get yoour paycheck never even caring if the company you work for is doing well or not,also he gave 30% of his income to charities ,thats a total of 43% of his money ,and remember obummer supporters this is money he could have totally lost on his investments.If you want to take the lazy way through life  then quit whining about your status(but oh wait lefties believe we should all make the same whether we do nothing to get ahead , or work our azzes off to provide a nice living and something for their next generationl more than the other person.And notice i said their next generation meaning dont expect your neighbors to have to provide a future for their own kids and yours.As far as obummer on congress calling the gop leaders the ones that dont care,his party is no different,the latest bill submitted from the house was to cut aid to the middle east countries (this was attatched to the funding of the government bill till like january),and the democrats wanted a attatchment to it that would help a democratic senator in wyoming or wherever some hunting regulation thingy with his quest for reelection.Now unless your a complete moron you could see this for what it is the house wanted to punish the middle east countries and pass the bill but the democrats werent willing to do so unless they got some attatchment to it that would help one of their own to be reelected to the senate,hmmm.Well lets see what happened,harry reid  voted for more aid to the middle east instead of the pasage of the funding of our government because they could get an attachment to help their senator in need to regain his seat,solely because they want to keep the power in the senate.As far as obummer bashing the GOP for non action,that is what obamma wants to run on is against the party of No,reid has no intention of passing anything from the house and the current administration  just steps up to the mic and blames the GOp because thats their plan,they have nothing posative to run on.And you obummer supporters actually have the odassity to say the GOP is whats holding everything back.For the love of  what ever god you believe in or not believe in,wake up and smell the roses,our country in in a nose dive,and we stop it before its to late and no matter what we do we cant stop from hitting the ground.

Obama has a net loss of 1 million jobs – specifically if we check the non-farm payrolls statistic from the Jan 2009 to present:
Jan 2009 -> 134.38 million
present -> 133.30 million
That’s 1.08 million fewer net non-farm payrolls for the entire Obama presidency.

			Posted by: Alice | September 22, 2012, 10:26 am 10:26 am		



Marc, no way can you count jobs lost in the first 3 months of his presidency as not belonging to Bush’s policies. I’d say the fair count would actually be starting 6 months into President Obama’s 4 years.
No presidents policies can take effect that quickly. He’s not running a company, but a huge country.

Just askin, your question on whether Romney is a Christian is an interesting one.
While the Mormon faith does recognize Jesus and God, they have a number of ‘original’, i.e. made up, stories about Them in their holy book. Mormons practice a form of Christian primitivism, and while they recognize the Bible, they have their own book that their founder,Joseph Smith wrote. Some of their beliefs about God and Jesus are so different from mainstream Christian religions that most Christians do not consider Mormons Christians.
Some examples: God used to be a man on another planet.
After you become a good Mormon, you have the potential of becoming a god.
There are lots more of these non-Christian beliefs.
Most experts consider their religion largely a cult, as they have many of the same aspects of one. As an example, it is difficult to leave, and then the Mormon community shuns you.

What a hypocrite but what is new for Obama!  The GOP House has passed 42 jobs bills and other legislation that the Democrat held Senate won’t vote on.  Sounds like the pot calling the kettle black.  Maybe instead of only attending only 32% of his intelligence briefs, he would have known of the threats in Libya.  This man knows no boundaries on his rhetoric and ABC refuses to call him on it.  He stated that Fast and Furious started under Bush and ABC great investigative reporting is silent; What’s up Brian Ross, cat got your tongue.  He stated that the Libya terrorist attack wasn’t terrorism for over a week, never called on it.  This President is the most divisive I have ever seen in all my years.  The way you know President Obama is lying is that is mouth is moving.  I don’t have much faith in the GOP either but ABC does a great job of trying to discount them even when they need fact checking for their own fact checks.




			Posted by: John in VA | September 22, 2012, 11:05 am 11:05 am		



Quit lying about the Republicans trying to compromise and pass things people.  They have done nothing but drag their feet, obstruct, and block anything that would move the country forward.  There hasn’t been a budget passed in years, and the jobs bill has been sitting in limbo for a year.  The republican minority blocks every bill rather than compromise.  President Obama brought congressional leaders to the White House several times to negotiate, and he was the only one willing to compromise.  Republicans would rather block, kicking and screaming like Children.  Mitch McConnel said his #1 goal is defeating Obama.  As a leader in the Senate, shouldn’t it be his #1 goal be to do his job? Shouldn’t he negotiate, compromise, and work on good laws and initiatives that help people, rather than actively work to undermine the President? This must be why congress has a 10% approval rating.

Over 200 coal plants are due to close the first of the year due to Obama, yes, your electricity bills “will necessarily skyrocket”, Obama had a Democratic controlled congress the first two years of his office and is now whinning. gas is over $4/gallon and rising, QE3 by Bernanke to make Obama look good is deicimating the dollar and the buying power of the average family is down and has increased  costs to the average family  by $13,000/year. Why would anyone experiencing the Obama economy want more of the same? Why would Christians vote for a man who is antiBible through his support of infantacide and redefining marriage? Why would anyone be snookered by the hypocrisy of his class warfare when he wines and dines with the rich and famous like Beyonnce, Jaycee, Anna Wintour, vacations in Martha’s Vinyard, Hawaii,etc.,  plays hundreds of rounds of golf all of which are mostly on the taxpayers dime through Air Force One and Secret Service coverage? Mr Stingy Obama and Mr Confused Biden are cheapo when it comes to charity, they don’t spread their own wealth the way Romney has to charities and we are to follow this false messiah? Are Americans really that dumb? Obama endorsed the Arab Spring which ushered in the Muslim Brotherhood and created chaos in the Mid East, and we are to believe that he is expert in foreign affairs? We have a dead ambassador, a dead border agent, both  as a result of Obama’s abysmal handling of foreign affairs.

Can a new phase of our space program be developed to create new products solving problems here on Earth. The say certain crystals can only be made in space. They say these crystals can lead to new drugs to cure certain diseases. Can new cancer drugs be made in space? Can other products be made in space as well?
Perhaps it could be new filters that are made using nano technology? Could these filters be used to create clean water for drinking and for farming out of polluted water or even seawater? This product could be used in developing countries where there is a severe shortage of clean water.
Can better filters be made to greatly reduce pollution from coal power plants? Coal is still the cheapest energy source around the world. If we can produce these new coal power filters, we can reduce our global warming causing pollutants from this energy source. Can certain genetic engineered crop seeds be created in space; that are better adapted to droughts and pests?
Imagine all the jobs could be created in flying materials to and from space factories, in producing products that cannot be made here on Earth. We have drones technologies and robotics engineering that are advancing daily. I even read about a student who invented a type of rocket to fly into space for just a few hundred dollars. Can we create new contests for students to invent new space factories; as well as invent new rockets to fly materials to and from these space factories.
Imagine by looking upward towards the heavens, we can find our answers to big problems here on Earth. These include not only discovering better cancer drugs; they include better filters and seeds, as well.  By the world looking upwards the heavens; we may reduce our political infighting by starting a new space program such as this.

I don’t believe anything he says any more.  He blames Congress for not passing anything,  but he doesn’t even care enough to attend his intelligence briefings,   or address the American public in the aftermath of a terrorist attack.  He blames everyone else for what is going wrong in  the USA.  He has not backbone or integrity!

It’s interesting that facts never seem to get in the way of the President’s claims. In order for Congress to adjourn (which, traditionally happens in October of an election year), both the House and the Senate must agree to that stoppage. Now, in the 112th Congress, we have 51 Democrats and 47 Republicans with a clear Democrat majority. Since January of 2011, the House holds 193 Democrats and 242 Republicans…a Republican majority. (By the way, in the 11th Congress, the Democrats held a majority in both the House and the Senate.) So, by law , adjournment had to be a bi-partisan decision and blaming the adjournment on one party, or the other, is nothing more than blatant deception.

Under a culture of dependency, poverty becomes a trap, and recipients get stuck. Long-term welfare recipients lose work habits and job skills and miss out on the marketplace contacts that lead to job opportunities. That’s a key reason the government should require welfare recipients to work as much as they can. What could be called “workfare” thus tends to increase long-term earnings among potential recipients.

OHIO4ROMNEY,  Sorry to hear about your family loss.  Your BIL sounded like a proud man.   Unfortunately his opinion of our current President seems somewhat tainted.  Not sure if his dislike for Mr. Obama is driven by bigotry or objections to his strongly progressive policies.  The GOP/TEA congressional leadership has torpedoed the economic recovery in a vain attempt to regain executive power over the Nation.  We the people understand fully what the GOP policies “accomplished” the last time they had the reigns of power in Washington.  ($6T in addl debt, financial system catastrophy, 2 unfinished & un-paid-for wars.)  The current economic conditions are a direct result of these previous GOP policies, and their recent stonewalling (DEBT first, foremost, & forever) only prolonged the economic pain to maintain unemployment over 8%.  You may try to blame our present woes on President Obama, however it is truly failed congressional leadership & process that has harmed the American people (increased poverty & destitution).  Let me start with my dear congressman, Joe Walsh, a TEA Party fanatic who somehow thinks his exactly50%/50% win in my district (won by several hundred votes & took weeks to finalize election results) has the insulting fantasy that his extreme partisan antics are representing my district in any positive way.  I am working strongly with both my time & contributions to support Democratic congressional races in various swing districts.  Only by regaining legislative & executive control in Washington can progress be made to heal the deep wounds inflicted by 30 years of GOP mis-management of our country’s affairs.

FACTS? Highest sustained gas prices (which Obama can fix temporarily by opening up the SPR and longer term by allowing drilling in areas of known deposits and not deep water). Record sustained unemployment (which he could have eased with more drilling, authorizing the pipeline and trading more with Canada instead of OPEC). Record food prices (which he can ease regulations on corn growers and ethanol to help out). Record debt (which he could have begun work on with his own debt commission, but decided not to). Serious housing problem (which is the main drain on our economy and HARP 2 is a BS program that serves the interests of the banks we’ve already bailed out and Obama admitted itonly helped 23% of those it intended). So yes, let’s see Obama run on facts, not on your emotions with a BS story of how hard his life was. Must have been so difficult being born in Hawaii and somehow coming into thousands to go to Harvard. I don’t believe a word they say, but you can believe facts, not emotions. And, it has nothing to do with the party, color or race, it has everything to do with outcomes.

Yeah that Arab Spring thing has worked out well alright!   Maybe if Obama and Hillary just apologize a few more times,  our Muslim friend will finally stop hating us!  
The GM bail out cost the tax payers about $50 billion that GM will never pay back and GM is still selling new cars at a loss!  In fact they are losing about $40,000 on every Chevy Volt sold!  Alive but on Life Support is closer to the truth!
Oh and lets not forget the billions of dollars wasted on those,  not so alive Green Energy companies Obama was betting your money on!  Most all of them are now Dead or Near Death!

Quit lying about the Republicans trying to compromise and pass things people. They have done nothing but drag their feet, obstruct, and block anything that would move the country forward. There hasn’t been a budget passed in years, and the jobs bill has been sitting in limbo for a year. The republican minority blocks every bill rather than compromise. President Obama brought congressional leaders to the White House several times to negotiate, and he was the only one willing to compromise. Republicans would rather block, kicking and screaming like Children. Mitch McConnel said his #1 goal is defeating Obama. As a leader in the Senate, shouldn’t it be his #1 goal be to do his job? Shouldn’t he negotiate, compromise, and work on good laws and initiatives that help people, rather than actively work to undermine the President? This must be why congress has a 10% approval rating.

The only real job Obama had where he actually showed up (unlike his lecture job at Harvard) was as lead attorney for a class action suit to sue Citi bank to force them to make shaky loans to 186 people. More than half of those 186 loans ended in foreclosure with the minority homeowners angry that they were accepted for loans they couldn’t afford using deregulation passed by Barney Frank. Duh!!  Formula for failure that we all inherited. And, yet Obama has the gall to blame Republicans (especially Bush who was constantly attacked by Dems) for the “mess”.

“Many of the changes in the Affordable Care Act are starting this year, and in succeeding years,” DeParle told ABC News, “and by 2019 we estimate that the average family will save around $2,000.”

Our dirty little secret is our government destroying (mostly by sending to horse slaughter) our national icons, the wild horses & burros on our western federal lands.  Lands that are now being given to WELFARE cattle/sheep ranchers and oil & fracking interests.

Blame, blame, and more blame.
Here’s an idead Mr. President, why don’t you put a budget on the table?  Talk about unfinished business, your Administration hasn’t finished one thing it started, or delivered on one promise since you arrived in Washington, except for Obamacare, which is a joke.

“The CBO and financial firms agree that the stimulus saved millions of jobs.”
LOL – The new stat touted for the economically-challenged President – Jobs “Saved”.
Unfortunately Dems, we haven’t forgotten about:  Keeping unemployment below 8%, “250000 to 500000 jobs created per month”,  “shovel-ready not shovel-ready enough”, and jobs created at $185000 (at least) per job…

The GOP has done nothing but obstruct, filibuster, and block from their minority position.  Had the Democrats done that to the failed Bush regime, Fox News would be up in arms about it calling for Treason.  For some reason the GOP feels they have the right to whine and stomp their feet like babies, rather than do their jobs.  Their job is to pass a budget and get good legislation through, not undermine the President.  4 more years for Obama, put the Tea Party to bed.  Enough said.

Every bill they pass sits on Reid’s desk since he refuses to bring them to the floor.  This way they can continue to blame Republicans for bills not being passed.
Hey Hussein – You will be voted out!  You have not done this country any favors dividing our Congress and our country.  How about telling your country that after finding out 3 hours after the attack in Libya, you went to bed.  Or how about you not skipping Intelligence briefings since February?  You decided in the last 5 days to attend since someone called you out on it.  Why thank you for your concern!  You couldn’t even show up the day after the attack – no, you went to Vegas.  I guess what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas?
I could go on, but you are not worth my breath!  ABO/2012




			Posted by: cmm | September 22, 2012, 3:28 pm 3:28 pm		



Hey Nick….  They passed a budget at least in the House.  Maybe not Husseins since not 1 person in the House (including democrats) voted for it.  But, they passed a budget!  Problem is Harry stopped it in the Senate.  Tell me who the problem is?  Maybe you should stop watching the lame stream media and actually go to credible sources to find out who is really obstructing.
The key is to obstruct, blame the GOP and try to win support from the people who only listen to the liars in the media.  They all lie because their agenda is only to elect Democrats.  
My position – I don’t care who gets elected, as long as they have the people and not their own agenda as their point of interest.  There are not many left that do unfortunately!  Please take your head out of the sand.  Read unbiased reports if you can find them.

Obama can blame the GOP all he wants, but his party had control to do whatever they wanted in the House, but they lost control of the House because they refused to represent the majority of the nation, so the democrats were fired.  That’s their fault for screwing up the best opportunity they’ve ever had.  The democrats screwed themselves and don’t even have the intestinal fortitude to admit it.  The nation simply isn’t as Marxist as their party is and yet they are incapable of understanding that.  If their policies and agenda were as good as they claimed, the GOP should have been buried in 2010 as the democrats promised they would for standing against the Obamacare scam.

econ101, They didn’t turn out to vote.  Correct.  Turns out, once the Marxism was beginning to be exposed, it wasn’t even attractive to that many democrats, except the socialist democrats.  It’s going to be a second round of that this time.  If the current polls used the last election as a polling model, Obama wouldn’t be ahead in any poll and even though the media is skewing the polls towards Obama now has is no reflection of reality, but rather reflects the hope for a repeat of the 2008 election before anyone saw what a disaster Obama’s socialism was to bring to the nation.  Truth be told, that won’t be repeated this time and not even by a “close” margin.  Remember, Scott Walker was supposed to lose his politically charges recall election and he was not only re-elected to his first term, he was re-elected by a larger margin even and it was because he was NOT a socialist.  Obama will not be re-elected for the same reason the people threw out as many democrats as they possible could in 2010.  The socialists promised the GOP would be removed from office for fighting the Obamacare scam that was pulled over on the nation against its will.  I will never forget that message being made constantly, but I knew then as well as now, we are not a Marxist nation and the nation will not accept it.

 •A 0.9% surtax on Medicare taxes for those making $200,000 or more ($250,000 joint).
 •Flexible Spending Account contributions will be capped at $2,500.
 •The itemized-deduction hurdle for medical expenses is going up to $10,000.
 •A tax of 10% on indoor tanning services.
 •A 40% tax on “Cadillac Health Care Plans” starting in 2018.
 •A”Medicine Cabinet Tax” that eliminates the ability to pay for over-the-counter medicines from a pre-tax Flexible Spending Account.
 •A “penalty” tax for those who don’t buy health insurance.
 •A tax on medical devices costing more than $100.

Health care is a community based service , our local Doctors and neighbors are far more qualified and passionate to care for you and I than Washington DC can ever be.

President Barack Obama promised his health-care law would cost approximately $900 billion over ten years when he first proposed it. Since then, the price tag has continued to climb. Total spending under the Affordable Care Act will reach $2.6 trillion over its first full decade, according to a Senate Budget Committee analysis, which was based on Congressional Budget Office estimates and growth rates. I think it’s time to drop the pretentious name.

“The CBO still firmly maintains that eliminating Obamacare will cost taxpayers more than keeping it, and would increase the deficit.”—How is that possible. They jsut came out that it will increase to 1.9trillion , somehow more than the 900 billion sworn to and promised by the loony dems.

People need to be careful in the desire for freebies, the USDA is now considering biometric identification for all individuals who will  want FoodStamps. The RFID chip may  be a must for everyone who does not want to starve
“And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” (Revelation 13:16-17)

Once again it must be stated that Obamacare expands coverage more for less cost than ANY Republican alternative.

You folks are still repeating a thoroughly discredited analysis of the CBO report originally disseminated by Fox News.  It was false of course.




			Posted by: econ101 | September 22, 2012, 7:50 pm 7:50 pm		



“Actually these are the numbers”
No, they’re not.  Check Politifact, read the CBO report yourselves…the only way you can get that disparity is by comparing different time frames.

Obama has to govern dragging the Teapublican heavy load. In ’09 they vowed to ruin the economy and blame Obama. Repubs should stop bozoing in Congress and work with Dems cutting expense across to the bone and hiking the rich tax to Clinton levels. Republican gridlock and showdowns, not Obama, are slowing the Recovery.

Politifact rated the claim that the CBO said the estimated cost of Obamacare had doubled as outright false.  Anybody who doubts it can go see for themselves.

ECON101: “The economy will only take off like a jet plane if we enact a big stimulus program with lots of spending.
Otherwise it will continue to come back only quite slowly.
This is what many economists predicted from the very beginning.”——–That’s, by far, the stupidest thing I’ve heard yet!  What do you think?  That this is just make-believe money?  That someone somewhere in magic land just twinkles their fingers and billions of dollars appear out of THIN AIR!   We’re talking about REAL money!  Money that must either be pulled out of someone else’s paycheck or retirement fund…..or money that has to be BORROWED and repaid with interest!  You’re either extremely young and have never had to run a household with a REAL budget and trying to hold a conversation from data you nit picked out of your high school economics book——–OR you’re a Boomer who just hopes the country blindly keeps digging its grave for another 20 or 30 years until you’re gone and no longer have to worry about paying the bill!

“Obama has to govern dragging the Teapublican heavy load.”
Sure, it’s ALWAYS someone else’s fault —  Bush, Reagan, the GOP, the Tea Party, Big Oil, Wall Street, Corporations, CEOs, Doctors, Americans, the Tsunami, Europe, Talk Radio, Limbaugh, Fox News, ATM’s….. 
Otherwise, Obama’s leadership and genius would be legendary I’m sure…

“or money that has to be BORROWED and repaid with interest!”
You obviously aren’t following the markets.  interest rates are zero, actually negative in some cases now….that’s right, investors are willing to PAY US to borrow their money.
The Republicans want to turn down free borrowing while the economy continues to struggle.  it’s ridiculous.




			Posted by: econ101 | September 22, 2012, 8:13 pm 8:13 pm		



the Congressional Budget Office — specifically rebutted the charge that the costs had doubled, and they issued that rebuttal months ago. The CBO said that its latest estimates “are quite similar to the estimates we released when the legislation was being considered in March 2010.”
–Politifact
I mean…it doesn’t get more plain than that.  The CBO rebutted it themselves!  They have a link to the entire statement.

He’s talking about a Republican dominated congress that has a approval rating that hasn’t been over 20% in over a year and fell at one point to 10%.  The only thing they seem inclined to do is block everything Obama tries to get done, but I guess they even need a break from that.  If they put as much effort as they do into blocking everything, and instead started thinking about what’s best for the country we would all be better off.

Whatever – You’ll have better luck talking to a wall.
Econ claims  his insurance premiums dropped because of Obamacare.   Just can’t get into any messy details, such as which company he’s insured thru…

“He’s talking about a Republican dominated congress.”
Who?  Obama?  He’s never been part of one or President during one.

OBJUANRULES what a naive comment, you do realize these find doctors and hospitals want to be paid and a good part of the people in this country cannot afford to.  Every other industrialised country in the West has a form of Health Care, except the US, it is mind boggling that people are against this,  All these other countries like Britain, Germany, Canada, Sweden, etc… must all have it wrong.

LOGICSGOOD – the current 112th Congress has 242 Republicans and 193 Democrats, that makes it a Republican dominated Congress,.

“the current 112th Congress has 242 Republicans and 193 Democrats, that makes it a Republican dominated Congress,.”
No, that would be the makeup of the House of Representatives.  The Senate is controlled by the Democrats, for now.
Congress is currentlty split.

I’ll tell you what insurance company I have if you can convince me it’s important.  otherwise I’ll just tell you I got a nice fat check back from them because of Obamacare.

Then theres the 4 years of tax receipts before the benefets are even paid from obamacare. It is a simple trick to make anything look likes it cost less! But the dimwits still believe it!

The GOP hasn’t done anything in 2 years..why start now?  Of course they’ve barred every single bill that might help the economy so that we could be sure and get over 400 bills on abortion.  Remember the ‘jobs, jobs, jobs’ they screamed to get elected?  And haven’t murmured the word since.  The GOP needs to go PERIOD.  Last thing we need is more Bush doctrine, which is exactly what they are promoting.  If it is such a good policy, and good for America then why don’t they have W endorsing Romney and making apperances?  Wall St. in the White House is the last thing we need.

Hey, Barry!! Did you ever get the idea that your lips were a’flappin’, but no one was listening? I guess not… ‘cuz you keep on flappin’ them anyway! In order to be heard, you have to first have their respect… in order to garner their respect, you have to know how to LEAD… and you’re a ABSOLUTE FAILURE at leading anything beyond a like-minded “community,” and therefore you garner ABSOLUTELY NO FROM ANYONE!!
And now you’re criticizing them for going home to campaign for the next 6 weeks, despite the fact that all you’ve been doing for the last 3.5 years is to CAMPAIGN for yourself!
Once again, leading from behind, and blaming others for YOUR failures!!

If you on the right weren’t so busy taken in Hannity’s daily diet of slanted rhetoric and out-right lies, you could earn the right to comment on serious issues. Everything you hold against Obama comes straight from Hannity’s scripts which you know aren’t objective. Obviously, that rhetoric is designed to disguise your true reason for hating Obama so much, because there’s very little truth or logic to support the things you post. Could it be the color of Obama’s skin? That’s the only thing that could justify such silly comments. I think Hannity has taught you how to convince yourself that you’re not bigots. It’s not fooling anybody else.

And do what Obama asked: when you see a politician that should be in DC out campaigning, tell him or her to get back there and do their job. Oh, excuse me, I guess that would apply to him and Joe as well, right?

“Wall St. in the White House is the last thing we need.” – D

Wall St. in the White House is what we have right now.
Biggest economic collapse since the great depression according to the Demos and yet not one indictment of anyone on Wall Street.
What?  Those people are saints?
Obama is in bed with Wall Street, he got them QE3 didn’t he?
Pffftttt!

How excellent to see the people of Libya rise up to throw the extremist radicals out of their bases after the attack on the U.S. consulate! Congratulations President Obama! Real, positive change is taking place. And to hear Egypt say that after decades of the U.S. supporting dictators, real advancement and friendship is now possible.

“Wall St. in the White House is what we have right now.”
You right wingers are the most confusing bunch,  and you folks wonder why Romney has to reset, you folks claim the president is a socialist, geesh, then you cry and whine that 47% don’t pay taxes, the republican administration with bilateral republican house created that, then you complain about yearly deficits, but last administration didn’t put two wars on budget and couldn’t balance a single budget.   And then you have posters on here posting deficits, but don’t post yearly government spending and the revenues that came in those same year and expect us to believe that deficits are the same as government spending?

You got 10 seconds to talk. The only thing you criticize on is a fucking video game? You know: It's not the games that makes gamers violent,lag does. Think 'bout that for a second.
Just explain to me this: Because of video games people buy a gun and shoot someone. You thinkďťż a video game can do such things? Then go make a video game. Go play a video game.
10 Seconds to talk. And my whole day has gone to shit. Fuck you, asshole. Fuck. You.

Yes, becuase when I play Halo or CoD I have the sudden urge to go on a mass shooting spree.
Ifďťż the person is actually having those thoughts playing those games, they ALREADY have a problem. Mentally stable people wouldn't because that's what they are: stable.
Firing a weapon in a game is NOTHING like firing a weapon in real life.

Have any of you seen the interview with the mother who was at school before the police got there? She said the black car in front of the school had all four doors open and black sweatshirts were strewnďťż on the ground by the car. If so, who tampered with the evidence. And why hasn't mainstream news run with that story. That's key evidence that somebody tampered with. Him. The question why all four doors open and black sweatshirts on the ground?

Well when you have typical armchair parents who take no interest in their kids life and let violent video games raise them and the parents themselves instill no morals or give any guidance to their kids, where areďťż these kids gonna learn social skills? Call of duty?The whole gun argument is bullshit, Switzerland arms their citizens and they have next to no gun crime because they are more family oriented and better educated people. We need to start addressing the root issues here and not guns.

i am not an expert and never will claim to be, but i look at the facts.
Columbine- shooters manic depressive.
Aurora- shooter saw three mental health professionals who all referred him for treatment. he obviously had some sort off delusional split personality disorder.
Sandy Hook- theďťż shooter was autistic...
this is the real issue, not gun control, not violent games, but people with obvious issues not getting the help they need before something like this can happen

Exactly, but society would rather find a quick scapegoat thanďťż actually face their personal problems head on and solve anything long term. The field of psychology is more geared towards medicating people (which exacerbates illnesses and makes considerable money) rather than finding the source of the problem and actually using their expertise to help people. Psychiatrists= glorified drug dealers.

See I live in the U.K. I am manic depressive and have had treatment, never once have i ever been put on medication. over here it is only used in the most serious of cases, most cities have free counselling normally six sessions, they use cognitive therapy that works on changing the outlook a person has... it dosent work in all cases, and these things will always still happen but to not do anything is to activallyďťż encourage things to never change

yeah because there is no correlation between tellingďťż people to fuck off and being mentally disturbed. just because you say the words 'fuck off' to someone, doesn't mean you are mentally disturbed.

Second comment. And then all these idiots " nobody needs a gun". Well say that afterďťż criminals with guns breaks into your home and rapes and murders your family then maybe you will see the need for MY second amendment. I'm sure your golf club, baseball bat, kitchen knife, pair of scissors, or your wife's high heel will be a better deterrent than the sound if me racking my shotgun good luck with that!!!

Most o the comments I have read below are completely uneducated statements from morons. What the man is saying is that by playing violent video games,ďťż it conditions some young adults to glorify killing. They live in this fantasy world. I play COD myself so don't think I am bashing the game industry. However these games do have an age rating to all the asshole parents out there that bitch about the issue then buy them for their 12 year old. I support the 2nd amendment completely.

We never had COD when we were 10. So we'd take the Sheridan Blue streak down to the local corn crib, make a pit in the grain, lay there silent and shoot rats for a couple hours. It was awesome fun. I imaginedďťż myself everything from a sniper to a soldier to a holed up criminal. But it was just harmless imagination. I see little difference.

Who invented the video games? The pentagon that's who. They figured out that troops had a hard time shooting another human so video games will help them get acclimated to it. You get pissed when someone hurts a animal right? Your not acclimated to it. You see killing and dead people on tv and video games thenďťż you don't care because your used to it.

The problem I have with this video is not him saying that video games are bad, and, yes in some ways videoďťż games are bad. But the real crap barrel about this is that he is literally so stupid to think that video games are WORSE than guns..... (WUT)! Like, what! Didn't 28 children just die recently due to guns. What's that? What's the death rate caused by video games? Oh that's right... 0

Here you go. Violence in the media has gone up in recent years, there is no denying it.ďťż Game are more violent, movies are more gruesome, you see more violence in the news. Here is the kicker though - violence in america has gone down in the last 10-20 years. The media is just hyper sensitive about what happens, so that's all you hear about. It doesn't mean that it's worse than it used to be. It doesn't mean that violent video games and movies are causing violence. This man is also from TN... js

with the question to how ones life should be run, the clear answer is that big brother can not interfere with how one chooses to run there life, if they want to continue to be free.
I know the difference between real life and video games, were everything resets itself.
Why would that be though?
It is because, I have theďťż counter balance of other experiences and people around me to give me the intuition that what works in games won't work in real life.

Games do to and not sims smart ass.How do you think all teens are being educated on differentďťż kinds of weapons. Shooting people in the head on the video games. The Become so excited about it they want to practice it in real life. A six year child killed his father over seas with a pistol, shot him in the head, cause he play COD and role played it out in real life not completely knowing the reality of killing someone. You probably don't even have kids. Go back to masturbating and smoking weed,

Video games themselves aren't the problem. DUMBASS PARENTS usingďťż violent M-rated video games to raise their 5 year old are. When your child grows up practically desensitized through violent video games like cod with no restrictions on playing time, don't be surprised when they grow up to be one of those punk ass 14 year old assholes that find fun in killing small animals! WAKE THE FUCK UP and stop letting the liberals convince you that it's big brother's job to raise your kid.

I honestly believe the games are harmless, maybe even as valuable a release as crushing a baseball or smashing some bowlingďťż pins. But if folks allow media to raise their kids, spend their entire adolescence abandoned in front of media, it will gladly influence, even determine their identity. Real life understanding, especially at an early age, is key in a world where even the 6 o'clock news has a psychological spin.

Finaly somebody speak the truth. People take this as a joke but video games cause serious mental problems.

Allďťż he's saying is that video games have a greater effect on people than guns. Video games depict things while a gun just sits in the corner and does nothing. The ban or regulation of either would solve anything though.

I love the part when supports his opinion of "Video ganes effect people" with actual facts and evidence of this! Oh, he wait no he didn't. I'm sure most people linked to video games and gun crimes are nit commiting those crimes because of games.ďťż People like that usually are involved in a bad groups of people, like gangs, or they have had something in their life effect them or they are mentally ill. Video games is the easy way out.

@mnnyfrsh98 "auto guns" were not used in any of the shootings. Why do you people keep bringing up automatic weapons as a form of discussion? They are talking about "military style weapons"...well, military members use hunting rifles, revolvers, shotguns, bolt action rifles, semi-automatic (one shotďťż per trigger pull) rifles and semi-auto pistols. They are talking about banning some 200 different guns and outlawing them. Get your information right before you spew your ignorance.

How about instead of making excuses for the actions of individuals, why not actually hold these people accountable. Don't sensationalize the stories to portrayďťż the criminals as victims and then blame their lack of civilized manners on society or culture? These things happen all over the world with different weapons but god forbid people in the US protect themselves from crazy assholes that the gov't seems to continually protect.

I love video games, just as much as the next person...but everyone who has ever gotten on xbox live knows most of the people on these war games are under 10 years ofďťż age.. I know this is due to bad parenting, but our society is starting to raise children completely desensitized to war. They see in on television, in video games interactively and what not. No, the average child will not commit horrible crimes because of this, but it is still not a positive direction.

you guys aren't listening to what he's saying. he's saying he personally believes violent video games (and probably other violent media) are a large cause for crime. i don't think he's right in that respect, but he's saying that no matter what the government can't touch video games and they can't touch guns because of the first and second amendments. whatever though, i'm on youtube, it's like preaching to the deaf uneducatedďťż loud choir who disagrees with you.

Blame whatever the heck you want peopleďťż - blame the tool, blame a game, blame a movie, blame a drug, blame an organization. But you know who I blame? I blame myself along with all of you. All the teasing we witness, all the bullying, all the labeling, all the corruption and crap in the world. Who are we to just sit here and let this happen. Babies aren't born haters. They reap years of abuse - emotional, physical, etc. Now our society is advanced enough to have a bunch of old guys point fingers.

It's funny how they blame cartoony looking shooter games for causing violence yet hollywood has real life people with special effects today that can real make it look like real people being shot but they blame video games and saying nothing about movies. 20 Million units of Call of Duty sell with each new iteration, if video games was the cause we'd be seeing millions of these kind of murders everyďťż year. Why don't they say anything about the neuro toxin fluoride that's in the meds they take?

Weapon industry is a significant componentďťż of US economy, and an important one for some states. Companies do economic cost vs. benefit evaluations for their very survival, and that is normal. However, real politicians (as opposed to lobby yesmen) should do honest cost vs. benefit evaluations not only economically but also socially. Example: what is the social cost of having two hundred millions firearms around? Is there perhaps a little correlation with the number of mass shootings per year?

This is a 23 second out of context snippit. A tactic typically used by Liberals to sensationalize and garner an emotional response of the people by only releasing what they deem is necessary. Its propaganda, this is a form of censorship. The exposing of people to violence whether its movies, video games, a barrage of negative news stories, tv shows, or constant talk of war and death most certainly does change vulnerable and ignorant people and compells them to commitďťż heinous acts.

True, it is certainly out of context, and there is a bit of propaganda. So let us move on and think about what you said instead. How would you reduce the exposure of kids to violent videogames, comics or movies? Who is going to that? God forbid the government, that is liberal stuff, right? Who then? Keep in mind that education is key for solving it in the long term, so what exactly (if anything) did youďťż have in mind for the short term, that is in the time frame of four or five mass shootings?

You can't eliminate violence in humankind at all! Look at 10000 years of religious culture ie... Did they have success? No! Why do youďťż want to eliminate a spontaneous behaviour? Violence is simply an expression of strenght, but we can limit damns of violence with education, social activities, intelligence. President Obama asked form a law reform concernig lunge weapons, but it's absurd. Do you want peace? Simply: you must banish ALL weapons and guns. This is coherence, this works, the rest not.

This is a 23 second out of context snippit. A tactic typically used by Liberals to sensationalize and garner an emotional response of the people by only releasing what they deem is necessary. Its propaganda, this is a form of censorship. The exposing of people to violence whether its movies, video games, a barrage of negative news stories, tv shows, or constant talk of war and death most certainly does change vulnerable and ignorant people andďťż compells them commit heinous acts.

The Norway mass-murderer who killed 77 people said that he played certain video games to help him train to successfully kill as many people as possible.
Rocks are used to kill people too; and like rocks, guns can do nothing on their own without the intent of the people handling them.

the only way they're taking away my video games is from my cold dead fingers... which shouldn't be much of a problem since they haveďťż guns and what not. It actually offends me that video games have been brought up so much in this gun debate. What a bunch of god damn fools.

I agree,ďťż this guy obviously has a problem with violent games but at least he mentions they're protected by the first amendment.

He said video games are more of a problem than guns because video games affect people directly. He then said the first amendment limits censorship on video games while the second amendmentďťż limits gun rights... So the second amendment limits gun rights? Video game games cause more violence than guns? Words of a fool.

Yeah, that happens. But how often? I mean there willďťż always be someone that has some mental problems and do harm the society, that's inevitable, but guns, in fact, helped these guys to do what wanted. The senator, or the society cannot simply push the responsibility to the the video games. Guns do harm.

It'sďťż funny because he didn't say that video game kill people. He said video games have more effect on a person than guns. Bottom line, some people are screwed up in the head and they will kill if they truly want to. Fix the mental health system not guns or video games.

Their logical train is so completely off the tracks. People killed each other long before any of these existed:ďťż Guns, video games, rap music, violent movies, etc. People want to put the blame everywhere but where it belongs.
On People. Mental health is the most ignored and underreported issue in America, and people who admit to it are ostracized and vilified, so why would anyone admit to it and seek help? It MUST change, and it is the ONLY thing that will make a difference.

Did not know I could use a video game to kill someone, wow learn something new everyday. I guess ifďťż I used my Xbox to defend myself it might work, could just wrap the chord around their neck.

The problem in this country is the evil and the societal decay that has fallen on this nation because this nation turned its back on god. Where was god when those babies were killed in school? God was kicked out of school. Thats where. You reap what you sow. You turn your back on god but dont like itďťż when he turns his back on you...

Wanna do away with evil video games? Do away with the ACLU. This organization does more evil than good. All it does is cater to atheist, homos and evil in every form. It claims to stand for freedom of speech and expression.. But god forbid some christian wants to excercise his freedom, anything that prevents the societal decay.. And all hell breaks loose with the ACLU. It needs to be shut down. We dont have a gun problemďťż in this country.

Blame the video games not the real actual thing. How can gun people think banning video games is good. They say guns which actually fire REAL fucking bullets arent the problems but killing fictional characters with pixelated graphics are. Do they think toyďťż cars are responsible for car accidents?

Secondly,ďťż this is ain't gonna stop anything, people will do what they want to do and government with their false moral superiority is not gonna fucking stop anyone from exercising their freedom.

You may be eighteen but you obviously didn't pass highschool, so youďťż are no smarter than the people you say are so malleable, oh sorry you probably don't know what that means. A better word to use around people like you would be easily manipulated, by these video games, in fact, the eight year olds you are saying are so easily manipulated by media re probably smarter than YOU are.

I've played video games for as long as I can remember, and I can safely say that the majority of them were violent in some way, but you don't see my name on any criminal record, I had noďťż discipline problems in high school, and I have A's and B's in college. So I don't think that vid games are really an issue here.

You're retarded. 9/11 happened because of Terrorists, who, yes, armed with box-cutters (though no one gave a shit about a cut from aďťż box-cutter) claiming the Plane was SET WITH EXPLOSIVES *DING DING DING*...yep, that's what the people on the plane were afraid of and thinking they were hostages for ransom instead of cargo for the terrorists' death ride, that's why most failed to act before the end.

He never said video games kill people. You've been manipulated by the power of leftist suggestion, fed to you by the liberal uploader viaďťż the video's false title. I guess you're susceptible to that kind of thing.

He said that video games are more dangerous than guns, guns kill people, if guns kill people, and video games are more dangerous, then they have the potential to kill people OBVIOUSLY. I don't giveďťż a single shit about politics. Obviously you are republican, I can tell because your head is firmly placed up your ass.

He didn't say dangerous. He said video games are a bigger problem than guns.ďťż He didn't really elaborate any further and then the video ends a few seconds after that.
You're hallucinating about 20 additional words of speculation based on a single sentence combined with the misleading power of suggestion introduced by the misleading video title.

Alright, your words carry some truth, but you're oversimplifying the matter. He is comparing video games to guns, and claiming that they are a bigger problem. In what ways, given the context of the situation, which I'm sure you know if you watch the news, would guns be comparable to video games? Please, reply with as manyďťż alternative comparisons that would contradict our "speculation" as you can think of/fit in the text box.

His saying video games are a bigger problem than guns doesn't necessarily mean he believes video games are comparable to guns(which is also more speculation on what did he mean?) He might mean that more people are impacted negativelyďťż in the US by video games than real guns(now I'm speculating)
I think it's unhealthy for kids to waste many hours playing & focusing on video games every day(even just a few hours every day). Moderation would be key, but kids aren't always good with that.TextBoxFull

The main point is this Republican Senator is not a threat to the right to own a gun or a video game, becauseďťż the US Constitution doesn't permit it, according to the Republican Senator himself.
But what does President Obama think of the 1st and 2nd Amendments? My opinion? Not much.

When public figures speakďťż publicly with little explanation as to what the he /she may mean, the public must speculate until further clarification is given. How else would you form an opinion about these events? Opinion is what the US government is all about. And since we must speculate, and since he brought up video games while speaking about guns, there is not many other alternative meanings to what he was saying. The relation between playing vid games and health is somewhat irrelevant.

Now how do you get rid of 300 million guns and prevent guns coming inďťż from Mexico? Guns will always get in the hand of criminals.

So much stupid in one sentence, quick little history lesson in Germany 1933 some people were convinced of the same thing....then the Holocaust happened.
It is the same every time
Stage 1: Disarmament
Stage 2: Confinement
Stage 3: The murder of pretty muchďťż anyone the government wants.

Predators always attack the weak, owning a gun is the biggest deterrent for crime.

There will be no ban! This is something to take your minds off the wars. Yes, the wars! Politics at its finest here. We are sending more troops over seas and less security at our boarders. Our troops play videoďťż games and with guns everyday. If they can have them...so can we!

and for the fact that you want to ban all guns for a few careless people, then you want to punish the majority for a minority? how about fixing the true issue and punishing the minority with the problems rather then the majority who dont. i swear hearing you talk is like beingďťż in kindergarden all over again. oh no one person talked in the hallway, everyones in trouble!

ive never heard ANYONE say someone cant die from a gun... a sword is designed to kill. but i have one hanging up on my wall right now (i love Excalibur as well as the medieval times) and your truth about gun deaths can be applied to everything (more cars more car deaths) and no thats not more then you can say. cause belive it or not, your in the majority of gun holders.. truth is there are more people NOT killed by guns then people that are. you can beďťż killed from a hundred things, not just guns

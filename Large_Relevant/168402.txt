Damn, I wish there was live footage for this. On the other hand, once I start watching HP live, any hope of﻿ getting anything else done... shrivels. The god Marriott and his crew.

Not post-Zep, but contemporaries of Zep. Supposedly Page asked Marriot to sing for the band before he found Plant. Dunno if that's urban legend, but I do know that I saw the Pie from 20th﻿ row center in '73 at a sold-out show at the Int'l Amphitheatre in Chicago. Best blues-rock show band I ever saw live. Rock ON.

Page talked about it in the interview for Trouser Press (1977). It was around May 1966, the band was going to be Page, Beck, Moon, Entwistle and Hopkins.
"Next, we thought of Steve Marriott. He was approached and﻿ seemed to be full of glee about it. A message came from the business side of Marriott, though, which said, "How would you like to play guitar with broken fingers? You will be if you don't stay away from Stevie." After that, the idea sort of fell apart."

(continuation)
In 1966 Marriott was in Small Faces. In 66 they were a popular new band in England, Robert Plant was a huge fan of Small Faces. Anyone who think especially about Marriott as a "post-zep guy" should listen to Small Faces "You Need Loving". This is an eye opener ! As they say "copying is the highest form of flattery". Yes,﻿ listen till the very end- till the line "woman, youuuu neeeed love yeeeeah"

That was when rock was still rock and before Frampton became too commercial.
Marriot with one of the greatets rock﻿ voices of all time imo.
The first 3 lp's by them are also very good especially the third just called Humble Pie with the strange white creature cover.

"Rockin The Fillmore" came out when I was 17. This song along with Four Day Creep are my two favorites on the album﻿ but it's all great. And the worthless shit people listen to now is not even real music, just noise. The fact something like "rap" even exists is proof there are millions of people with no IQ at all.

I had the HONOR of seeing them quite a few times as well. They were the first big time rock concert I ever saw in 1970.﻿ They changed my life forever. they inspired me to learn to play guitar bass and drums. To this day their style shines through in style. On all three instruments.

I have to second that. But I also want to clarify: It's Rockin' the Fillmore. Or even more correctly, Performance / Rockin' the Fillmore. I would not want folks to get confused and miss out on one of the best live﻿ albums of my generation.
People, find this album.

Check out old videos of Steve Marriott when he headed up the Small Faces during the 'British Invasion' of the early '60s. Back then he was laying down the roots of hard rock that eventually made the transformation from "Itchycoo Park" to﻿ "Thirty Days in the Hole"

This must be the first proper riff I ever learned on the guitar.﻿ I remember listening to them on my cassette walkman when I was 12. The song that follows "Stone Cold Fever" on this album is "Rolling Stone" - another hair-raising masterpiece and a great cover. I used to listen to this album like 4 or 5 times in a row... you took me way back with this man... thanks...

Great stuff on this album. Frampton's playing was jazzy and pointed me off into the jazz-rock genre after I had started﻿ out with blues rock. Of course Marriott was the total rocker with his singing, guitar and harp playing. Rock On Steve !

Well vocalist/guitarist Steve Marriott and vocalist/bassist Greg Ridley﻿ both died. Peter Frampton voc/guitar still has his solo career, Clem Clempson who replaced Frampton after "Performance Rockin The Fillmore", plays with his old mates in Colosseum, Jerry Shirley the drummer was in Deborah Bonham band a while ago, and he wrote a book about The Pie, and other bands that he was in. It should be released this year.

This is for Akileas: The drummer for Humble Pie was Jerry Shirley. In my opinion he is one of the most underrated drummers in Rock History. He never really received the recognistion that he﻿ should have received.

@surprisevisitor20000
Yes! I've been a fan of Steve M.﻿ since the Small Faces! And I never tire of the power and deep sincerity of the man's voice! Guess I liked Small F's since I was in Jr. High. Then, comes Humble Pie- I'm blown away! Great talent from way back when!
I love music from this era, and feel sorry for lots of younger folk. They don't know this was everyday music to us. Lots of what passes as music today just ain't it! JipHop sux, to use the vernacular.
Blessed 'Be

Thanks for your reply! It made me come back here to hear this song. Ohhhh the﻿ power! I agree - every other day back then you could just wander over to the record store and pick up something like this album based on the cover alone - even if you had never heard of the band before. You'd take it home, give it a spin, and be addicted to the sensation du jour, like what happened to me with these guys. I still absolutely love this - almost 40 years after I first heard it (I was 14 yrs old)!!!

Could you add "Big George" and "Shine on" from the "Rock On" album to this great collection of Humble Pie songs you've started? It's just too﻿ bad that there is so little actual footage of the band available, but you've done a great job with this slide show.

Seems like there'd be more footage of these guys from back then. ﻿ They were really popular...Not like they were obscure. The only footage they ever show on t.v. is lipsynching of "Natural Born Woman."

Steve died in a fire in his cottage in Essex after returning from the USA where he was working on some new stuff with Pete Frampton. It was Jim Leverton and Jerry Shirley in Marriotts packet of three as can be seen on the﻿ DVD "Steve Marriott live in London" which is well worth a look. R.I.P Steve, your missed.

It was a big scandal in Cleveland﻿ about 10 or more years ago. The radio station had a food and money drive called "30 days in the hole". JS would stay at a trailer and receive donations. Some money was found to be missing.

I thought the Leslie West stint was back in the 70's and quite short lived. He was working with Frampton again, but freaked out when some record industry types suggested a full blown HP reunion.﻿ He also died in his cottage not in a hotel room.

Yeap I got to mwork with him. Steve had come to the states because of the﻿ english version of the IRS. I was part of a club band called Deluxe we were pretty wild and very loud which Steve liked ...lol we were working a club near where he lived. then he surprised us the next nite with his axe and amp he had the biggest grin as he asked "Can I sit in"? We couldn't believe it we said "Hell ya " as one and I took the guitar and amp to the stage then got him a beer.

Indeed. I expected it to be a drug overdose too,﻿ quite a surprise to see it was just that his house burnt down. He also seemed pretty sickly in one of his later performances, and I figured his days were nigh from just sickness, I guess he was actually just healthy. lol

His house burnt down in April of '90 or '91, and it's said the reason for it﻿ was a cigarette.

It's a shame more people who weren't around in the early '70s don't know how great Steve Marriott and the band were. Marriott's voice, in my opinion,﻿ was of equal magnitude to any vocalist of that era - think Rod Stewart', Mick Jagger, Robert Plant, et al - and he could blow the harp as well as anyone I'm familiar with, as well. What a talent, what a loss.

Actually, the lyrics to the second verse are:
Tried too hard, my head is spinning.
Something's﻿ wrong, holding hands
A green wasp, as long as my hair
All I do, is a daydream nightmare

cree8vision, may be﻿ you are right. English is not my mother tongue, so
I am not sure what the truth is. But when I listened it again and again, I heard:
I've been washed, as long as my hair
Without you it's a daydream nightmare.
Unfortunately he is not alive to tell as, what he was singing.
But I think the more important thing is, that his music is alive and as long as we listen it, he will be alive for us!

Amazing band. ﻿ For those of you who haven't seen the film "Almost Famous," it's script was based on the then teenage Cameron Crowe's (the movie's writer/director) time spent as a rock journalist touring with Humble Pie. It's great stuff. The band in the movie is fictional but what happens is based on a Humble Pie tour in the USA.

Thanks, keefek -- "Almost Famous" is an awesome movie. Cameron Crowe won the "Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen" Oscar for very good reason. Roger Ebert's review of it starts as follows: "Oh, what a lovely film. I was almost hugging myself while I watched it." That only seems﻿ excessive if you haven't seen it.

One of THE BEST live albums ever recorded.
Why this band isn`t in the Rock & Roll Hall Of﻿ Fame is beyond me.
HUMBLE PIE would boot half of today`s so called bands off of the f`ing stage.
You are right mattlee they don`t make em like this anymore.
HUMBLE PIE was one of the greatest bands that I ever saw live. Believe me, I have been to a lot of concerts.
When "PIE" was in the area, my friends and myself were there. Always looked forward to seeing HUMBLE PIE live. ROCK ON!

Testify...
It looks like Steve may have played an old Les Paul Jr. at one time. Man, I had one of those. It was sweet. The neck was about a "yard" long. I gave fifty dollars﻿ for it. It's probably worth a fortune today.

He did. It was given to him by a fan and he replaced the pickups for a meaner tone. It was a Les paul Jr. double-cutout with﻿ a pickup cover off another guitar. It was stolen on tour.

Very cool! I grew up just a few miles from Shea. Never saw a concert there, unfortunately, as there have been some great ones, like The Rolling Stones on the Steel Wheels tour. I wish﻿ I saw that one. I imagine Humble Pie must have put on a great show way back when.

Yeah, I guess I shouldn't be so surprised, since there was a lot of metal in the stands and it was open in the back.
Roosevelt and 149th, cool! Right next to the Murray Hill station of the LIRR. :)﻿

Just listened to 'Are You Gonna Go My Way'- it's not the same rhythmic pattern but the chords and the way they ring out are the same. But then﻿ again there's every likelihood Lenny's never even heard of this song.

I was going to slam Kravitz, but I guess it's all a matter of personal taste. I got a little upset that he was mentioned in the same sentence as The﻿ Pie.

Then why isn't he wearing Japanese clothing? Why is he in a place it's snowing heavily? Why why WHY? If it was meant to have Japanese underlinings, then he should have had more Asian things attached to﻿ the video.

Babe, cool your milk jugs. All things will be revealed in time, okay? Okay, okay?
Also, it snows in Japan﻿ and Japan also has desolate Rocky shores/cliffs such as the one in this video.

Actually, if you read the wikipedia page for the song You're Beautiful, it's true. And I quote, "The video shows Blunt committing suicide, following a Japanese tradition of removing one's shoes and contents of﻿ clothing prior to jumping from a great height."

You don't need Japanese Clothing .-. It's just a type of japanese suicide. Doesn't﻿ mean you have to be so into it you wear japanese clothing and underlinings .-. It's where one removes their clothes. Not Japanese clothes. Just THEIR clothes man.. damn u make me feel you read it wrong or understood it wrong or is dumb

I feel like you misread what I wrote wrong. If he was going for a Japanese motive in his video, then he should have made it more obvious.﻿ I don't believe this is made to be taken after the Japanese suicide deal, for there is no evidence in the video other than he kills himself. People kill themselves for many reasons. If anything, he can't handle his emotions and kills himself his basically the main reason for teenage suicide it seems in any culture. Not because their Japanese.

If he was going for a Japanese motive? Mm﻿ name me a case when suicide included the actions he had done in this video. Should it matter if he was going for a "japanese motive". Mm you also misread what I wrote, or typed.. How about we both research this topic and see what we come up with.

Hes not wearing socks because it would take too long within the context and time constraints of the video to remove them YOU STUPID IDIOTS. All those dopes in the music biz calling themselves "artists"﻿ and here we have a young man who really is one and PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT HIS FOOTWEAR. Nuts nuts nuts

Hey, I’m a young artist, & I would really appreciate it if everyone would check out my original song, “Open Road.” “Open Road” was inspired by impactful power ballads such as Mariah﻿ Carey’s “Vision of Love,” Christina Aguilera’s “Beautiful,” & Brian McKnight’s “Back At One.” I promise you that you will not regret giving my original song a listen, & it will truly move you! So please listen & enjoy! Thanks!

This actually reminds me of my time in America this year (Im from Australia). WE were on a cruise and I went to the 17s kids club, wasn't really feeling it until four cheerleaders came up to say high. For the next five days we were inseparable, all of us. But there was one girl that was beautiful funny smart everything you look for in a girl. Life was brilliant, perfect: me and her arm in arm looking over the ocean on a cruise ship sailing around Mexico.It never occured to me that it﻿ could end

UN HOMBRE CUANDO TRAICIONA A SU MUJER DURANTE DOS AÑOS Y ESTA LE DICE QUE PASA ... TIENE DOS OPCIONES : 1 - LE CUENTA LA VERDAD , LE PIDE PERDON Y SE VA CON SU AMANTE 2 - LE CUENTA LA VERDAD LE PIDE PERDON Y JAMAS VUELVE A HABLAR Y VER A SU AMANTE LO QUE NUNCA SE DEBE HACER SI ERES PERSONA Y TIENES SENTIMIENTOS ES SEGUIR MINTIENDO , TRAICIONANDO Y HUMILLANDO ... ASI JAMAS SERAS FELIZ , JAMAS TENDRAS PAZ Y CUANTO MAS TIEMPO PASE MAYOR SERA EL DOLOR Y PEOR﻿ SERA EL FINAL

This song gives me a beautiful memory. As cheesy as it sounds. I think it was when I was 10 when this song came out. It was a gloomy day outside and the flowers were bloomy and when this song came on i thought wow those flowers are quite beautiful aren't they? that was such a deep thought for a 10 year old. And also the fact that I didn't have to worry about boys, college, money, or career.simple times. I love listening﻿ to this song to bring those memories back even for 3 minutes and 23 seconds

No, not cheesy. Heartfelt feelings never are. The song took you to a certain place. That is the real reason for music. It is all therapeutic.
Keep﻿ and hold the beautiful memory.

Strong, sore and unrelenting is the sword of the Lord GOD of Hosts
who will punish inquity in His wrath, as it is written:
"Vengeance is mine says the Lord, I will recompense."
Great is the justice of JESUS Christ against the transgressors.
Great is the fierceness and wrath of Almighty GOD.
The cursed shall suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.
Unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
The Lord will visit the wicked in His great anger.
He will pour out of His﻿ fury as streams of brimstone.

I gave this song to my ex-girlfriend﻿ and she laughed and said, "You're Cheesier than blue Cheese". Oh well. Just some Advice about certain types of girls... Never be too 'nice' or they take advantage of you. Been 3 Years and I still miss her. I'm 20 years old now.. After Years of dating and still.... she's the only girl I ever loved.

You could watch a video without an advert?
Music videos were uploaded by users and not VEVO?
The title was on top of the video?
You could scroll through the user's videos whilst watching another one of﻿ their videos?
The website wasn't controlled by corporations?
WE MISS THE OLD YOUTUBE!
Post this on every video and let's start a campaign to get the old YouTube back?

They change it depending on﻿ where it's played. For example, on the radio it's 'flying high' because they can't broadcast it in case there are children listening and stuff.

It's﻿ a Japanese suicide ritual that requires﻿ clothes to be removed. It creates some sort of 'natural' bond with whatever spiritual entity they believe in with regards to this ritual.

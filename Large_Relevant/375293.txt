													Michele Cardoso, one of the more than 230 people who died at the Brazilian club Kiss over the weekend, posted a plea for help on Facebook 50 minutes after the blaze began.
													




A young woman trapped inside the deadly Brazilian nightclub blaze this weekend posted one final message to Facebook, pleading for help as the building burned. 
As Gawker notes, Michele Cardoso, a 20-year-old medical student, was at Boate Kiss on Sunday with her sister and her boyfriend, João Paulo Pozzobon. 
About  50 minutes after the fire began, Cardoso was able to access Facebook one last time.
"Fire at KISS help," she posted to the site. 
All three patrons died in the blaze, according to Gawker. Pozzobon's Facebook page still shows his Foursquare check-in at Boate Kiss. Below the post, one user wrote: "The last check-in." 
One of Cardoso's friends told Brazil Extra that she had always been a very cheerful person.
More than 230 people were killed in the crowded Santa Maria club after pyrotechnics ignited the soundproof foam. 
"Large amounts of toxic smoke quickly filled the room, and I would say that at least 90 percent of the victims died of asphyxiation," Dr. Paulo Afonso Beltrame, a professor at the nearby medical school, told the Associated Press.
At least three people have been arrested in connection with the blaze, including the club's co-owner.

				Why does this kind of thing keep happening? They said the nightclub was far over it's capacity. I'm wondering if the place had a sprinkler system? Apparently not. They don't seem to have the safety regulations concerning these things that we have here. Really a shame all those people had to die because the owners of the club were too greedy to care about the safety of their patrons. Hope they can sleep at night.

				as i read prior comments below, I am shocked by some of the responses; put yourselves in their positions if you knew only one way to contact someone/anyone would you do all you were capable of doing to get that help! Also while everyone is so hot fired to focus on her posting to facebook, how about we ask why the exits were blocked from letting the club goers exit the club, isn't procedure in any place that you are to use all exits in case of an emergency; so next time you have comments that disparage the dead for what could possibly be their own way to 'reach out' think before you post something!

Thats why they increased cash by 600 million dollars last quarter even in the largest transition EVER. I'm sorry you feel so threatened by BB10. You﻿ must have a WP8 and regret buying another one of M$ slapped together OS's that are only half complete. GL.

No, they dont.. You clearly did not understand the point/premise. It was shown at BB Jam Americas. AKA for developers. It's about developers. It is meant to show their devotion for developers beyond providing great resources (which everyone agrees, they have).
So now you may ask, "who cares﻿ about developers?". To which I will tell you that # of apps was a major reason BB Market share decreased. Therefore, yes, they are doing a great job courting devs, and getting a great ecosystem. <3 BB10!

This comment has received too many negative votes

Consumers want touchscreens, yes - but the BB is not a consumer device. BB will never be the iPhone and they might have ruined the company by trying to be. However, millions of business people still want BlackBerry's best-in-class keyboard for email﻿ and SMS. Had they stuck with what they do better than anyone else (and what millions of people are used to), the company would be in a much stronger position today.
The touchscreen BB10 is going to fail miserably. Stick to keyboards, BB!!!

I love it when people say something will fail miserably before even seeing the product or holding it.
Side note, they're releasing a full QWERTY keyboard BlackBerry 10 device too so they're not abandoning that sector. I understand why many people doubt the new OS and its acceptance, but having used it myself, I can tell you it's insanely efficient, cool to use, easy and blows away anything out there.
Just give it a chance﻿ once it hits the market, I think you'll be surprised.

Did you not hear him "Full touch AND QWERTY editions"...
Why don't you watch the﻿ video before making such an ignorant post...

Relax, kid -- I'm switching back to BB when the qwerty edition comes out. I heard him loud and clear. My comment﻿ stands true, regardless.

But you fail to realize that the business sector doesn't have enough growth for BB to regain all its lost marketshare and is therefore looking at the top selling phones on the planet and have noticed a trend,﻿ they all lack physical keyboards. I will take a very close look at the Z10 as it may be my next phone!

Seems to me like they're just having fun. Besides, i think they're thanking their developers in a funny/cute-ish/weird kind of way,﻿ not marketing to non-supporters. So, quit hating.
I still believe in this company. I hope they find enough zest to spark the excitement and loyalty they once had and lost.

You've stated that you believe that BB10 is likely to reach 3rd place (If the article I've read is correct). You also say that you won't go with android because you can't differentiate yourselves from the competition with﻿ that OS. Why not test the waters with a WP8 device? You don't have to leave your platform, just test the waters. I know BB10 seems a safe bet. But why leave all your eggs in one basket? At least try WP8, because MS seems to be shooting for the top. I don't want RIM to die.

It's because all of the people here hating on BlackBerry, used to be BlackBerry owners that were either too immature or too impatient and fickle to wait for BlackBerry to get back in the game, when they switched to Iphone or﻿ Android, and are now trying to convince themselves that their decission was the right one by trying to convince all of us that RIM "will" fail. If it makes them feel better about themselves, let them hate!

I have a torch 9860, waste my money expecting that this phone was gonna be awesome, Worst piece of plastic and metal I ever bought. Even major companies for eg Booz Allen Hamilton Inc have switched from blackberry to apple and android as smartphone﻿ providers. Blackberry is failing fast and unless blackberry Ten can run apps as cool and fun and as efficient as apple or android devices, they are gonna be finished

If all you want to do is play games on your phone, then stick with your Iphone. If you are a businessman like myself, that uses my phone at work more than at play, then you will want a BlackBerry. Remember BB started the Smart Phone industry, and it was started for business application, not for little kiddies to play﻿ Angry Birds on. If that's all you want, then buy a PSP!

How many apps does a frigg'n phone need? A BlackBerry﻿ is a smartphone with emphasis on the "PHONE"! If you only want to play games, then buy a PSP! Let those of us that want a phone that we can actually do something usefull with, stick with BlackBerry without all the harassment please!

Fine. If you don't like the BlackBerry, that's your choice. Don't know why you are commenting here though.﻿ Seems like nothing but IOS and Android Trolls here that are doing nothing but preaching doom & gloom for BB10. If it succeeds, it succeeds. If not, no skin off your hide, so why do you care?

This is pretty pathetic... I mean, when a company is built on business success, they can't instantly become "young and hip", especially when run by old white men.
Regardless, RIM is something unique, they have been a success in the past, they have in fact dominated the market﻿ at times.
BB10 isn't make or break for RIM, but it is make or break for Blackberry.

Thing about all these other phones, is that they are only one phone. If you work﻿ where you have to a have a secure business phone, then you end up having to have a second personal phone to have the freedom to do the things you want with it. With BB10, you essentially have 2 smartphones in one, which is definitely a plus for us business users!

But it's not a PR video - its a thank-you card to their devs. ﻿ Remember thank-you cards? Thank-you cards are usually a bit cheesy - at least this one seems heart-felt, and 'stars' people that RIMs devs actually work with.

Well the iPhone is creeping on a $1000 with couple accessories now that they have changed their adapter. I can build an 8-Core server for cheaper than that! Apple's "How much will theses idiots pay" tactics from greedy Apple. Maybe consider using Windows 8 Mobile, and corner the PC side of things, as most of corporate America looks for the most affordable and compatible phones for their employees. As a Blackberry owner in the past I would gladly give up my iPhone 4S﻿ for a Windows 8 Blackberry.

I am no RIM fan. Just someone who's been in the Tech industry for over 20 years, seem ups and down for everyone. Thought my comment was neutral and factual. I don't care who wins or loses. As long as there are good platforms out there for us devs to make a living on. And competition is always better for devs as it allows us to reach more users. The tech world is a better place with AAPL not crumbling in the 90's and it will be a better place if a strong third player can enter﻿ the mobile space.

Lol Apple users are confused and worried. This video is suppose to be funny and creative. They are real hardworking employees who happen to be showing their utmost support for the company they work for. I think it was clever and funny...they are targeting to all three markets: the older market (the﻿ remake song), the young generation (the humor) and their business users (the lyrics).

This is such a change of image for RIM. Amazing! Why the dislikes? Seems like most of these are from Apple/Droid fans who have been brainwashed into hating on BlackBerry. Pretty nonsensical. If anything, you'd think these people would appreciate the humor. Have some respect for RIM. None the great smartphones we now carry in our pockets would be what they are if it wasn't for RIM's vision in the late 90's that so many people laughed at then. I'm﻿ a fan of all devices... peace.

By innovating, not copying the iPhone as much as Android does and most importantly: not providing everything for free while﻿ making money by selling usage statistics and personal information, I think RIM deserves a lot﻿ more market share than Google.

This is a great way of Marketing Blackberry 10. They are positing themselves as supporters of all the Developers.
I have been using Blackberry for the past 2 years﻿ and was about to change it to either I-phone or Android.
But after watching all the sessions they did. I am defiantly getting BlackBerry 10.
Advice for RIM: Develop colorful Hardware as this differs with women in Middle East ALOT.

I really want Blackberry to succeed. I think the 1990's would have been better if Atari and Commodore hadn't tanked. But, I'm just not sure they can make it. I hope they have a plan B. It would be a very wise move to be secretly developing a skinned Android OS﻿ as a fallback.
And this video? Weird and kinda sad. But it certainly has people talking and I'm sure that's the point. Certainly kudos to them for not just throwing in the towel.

It isn't a weird analogy. Here's a lesson about computer history. Atari and Commodore made computers in the the late 1970s and until the very early 1990's. They had their own operating systems. They were incompatible with MS DOS and Intel chips. They were sucessful for a while but then they tanked because they couldn't keep﻿ up with Win-Tel. So choice of OS is better for the consumer. It was true for desktops and its true for smartphones and tablets.

If people are going to say "RIM is dead" or "long live Apple", it would be helpful to back those statements with something that is factual. As﻿ Monty Python movie would say "I'm not dead yet" and/or "I'm getting better" (insert with British accent). No one is saying you have to give up your iPhone or Android device for a BB10 phone. And you cannot compare the US market to other global markets where BB does better than those two.

No will argue that RIM messed up with the PlayBook. We all knew it was being released 3 months too early and the marketing plan behind it was non-existant. However, good companies learn from their mistakes and bad companies repeat them. If you attend half of the RIM development forums and attend their seminars, you will see that﻿ it is a different RIM from 5 years ago.

What does that have to do with anything? You must understand production﻿ and ease/security thereof is not just convenient, it’s imperative.
This was perfect strategy…confronts the issues head on, realize in today’s market Developers are critical to success and bring them in with the best tools available on the best OS available and best money available. Brilliant really.

I like these guys' effort, but the reality is that when you see Obama still uses the Blackberry, you know its over.
Kind of like when I saw﻿ Al Gore doing the Macarena, and George Bush saying "Whassuppppp!".
Blackberry is a product from a bygone era.
See you in the museum boys.

OK, really? 1) This is the﻿ first president that was allowed to have a mobile device. BB are the only device to meet security measures needed at that level. 2) Being Democratic or Republican has nothing to do with owning a BB device. I'm am certain just as many Republicans use BB for the same reason. It is probably one of the few things both parties can agree on. BB10 is not your parents BB device. People need to stop comparing BB10 with BBOS.

If the Apple fans took the same stance when Apple was a lot closer in going out of business then RIM is now, we would never get the cool Apple devices﻿ we have today. Only having 1.5 innovative solutions will stagnate the marketplace and innovation will slow. Everyone should be eager to have RIM do well with BB10. Increased competition increase innovative solutions which is better for consumers. Having BB10 a success does not take away the "i" devices we all love and the success of Samsung.

People: BB10 is not BBOS (currently available). Yes, BBOS is crap compared to Android and iOS, but unless you have seen BB10 and how it all works and flows together, you cannot make that comparison. Technology does﻿ not sit still. More apps does not equate to better apps. No one uses 700K apps. Most people just use 5-10 apps (outside games) so you have to look at what those 5-10 apps do. It would be more logical to wait till BB10 is out before you past judegement.

The video is about developing for BB10 and appreciating those that are developing for BB10. Yes, use Android, use iPhone, they are great devices. This is about having a choice to develop for a cutting edge device that is different. I've developed for Android and iOS and BB is easier, faster and a better user experience. When BB10 is released, you should check﻿ it out.

Apple has always been very good about taking other ideas and making them much better and cooler. The whole iOS is based on a Unix OS with a very pretty front end. No different than BeOS before it (but they wrote their own) and BlackBerry today (based on QNX OS). Apple is a great company, but all tech﻿ companies leverage other ideas; just Apple is very good at it and making people believe it was an innovation vs. and evolution.

Did the iPhone not just cause RIM to abandon their 14 plus year old OS, because iOS destroyed their market share? The iPhone created the new paradigm of the smartphone, revolutionary whether your bias will allow you to agree or not. And many of the concepts in BB10 are licensed from other companies﻿ so much for RIM innovating.

Just as Apple abandon their old OS for Darwin (an existing Unix OS) because of competition. BB10 is from QNX which was purchased by RIM. A method all companies do including Apple and Microsoft. Yes, Android and Apple forced RIM to re-evaluate their position, just as Microsoft forced Apple to reconsider theirs. This is a normal process in the tech sector. So why﻿ is this bad? You make it sound that just because Apple is a market leader, that no one else should try.

They are far from dead and they are not dying either. In the last three months, the number of BlackBerry users worldwide has gone up, not down, and the cash reserves of the company has also risen from $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Revenue was up 2% from the previous quarter.﻿ They are somewhat on hold until the new product comes out in early 2003, but that will be something truly new, unlike Apple's small changes in the iPhone 5.

iOS people love Apple products and the same with Android. However, if you are a developer, you should always be looking at the latest devices and technology to see where you can make more money. You can make a lot of money on BB (more so then﻿ Android) even with its low market share. Also, dont forget you can make minimum of $10K for your first app if done by January.

I can't speak for others, but I'm not hating, just laughing. They still think physical keyboards are a good thing (assuming they mean physical when they said QWERTY)? Although, there are people out there who are used to it, so they can milk it for a while.
Also, "It won't be forever"? - well, that's good to know.
Apart from those two qualms, I think, "Catchy! Sends the message to developers (very important group) that﻿ you still care, etc. Good job, RIM!"
As for more competition, I agree there.

Guys, you've gotta give RIM credit. They're actually trying to keep their mobile OS going. Sure, other mobile platforms like iOS, Android, and Windows Phone﻿ have sprung up, which gave RIM a real run for their money, but at least they aren't giving up. They're obviously not on top any longer, but this could at least give them a push in the right direction.

the reason that factory is empty is because manufacturing moved to china and other﻿ countries. probably cousins of foxconn employees. so rim is just as much a contributor to this fictious "slave" labor you speak of. also, be nice to see the inventory of your personal belongings...then i bet you wouldn't have the same tune

I bet you would "like to think Apple pays it's Chinese employees less than RIM" but sadly they don't. As you know, Foxconn manufactures products for many companies including Acer, Cisco, Dell, HP, Intel, Microsoft, Motorola, Sony, Toshiba. The list goes on. How many of those products﻿ have you owned? Also, Apple is the only company that hire the Fair Labor Association to review the working conditions at Foxconn, something that should have been investigated by the Chinese government.

cont... As for any RIM employees committing suicide...I'm sure somewhere along the line some have. Yes even in America people commit suicide because of work situations or finances. Given the fact that Foxconn has over 1.2 MILLION employees, as tragic as it is, the percentage of suicides in that company is very low. So I guess you wont purchase a GM car because they were "bailed out", or open a bank account in a bailed out bank. The best RIM can hope for is a buy-out,﻿ but it's unlikely.

Companies have their ups and downs. Apple﻿ was﻿ in a hole once, so was Microsoft. Every tech company has highs and lows. Yes, RIM is hurting, but the strong companies pick themselves out of it and become better. The BB10 OS is rock solid and their innovative approach will have the leaders trying to copy. They do not have to "beat" iOS, they just need to increase marketshare by 3-5% to become successful again, and then build upon that.

Haaah, is that﻿ all? The AppStore has 700k. That means if the AppStore stopped growing completely and if the 10k/month continued it would take RIM 5.8yrs to equal the number. 700k/(10k*12).
Yeah, iOS has been mostly the same since 2007. Why the f would Apple drastic change the worlds most popular and profitable smartphone
Even if Apple stopped selling iPhones they still have their $100bill to keep them alost for DECADES until they built a new product

Windows Phone may take the enterprise/business market, Android will take the nerd/hacker﻿ market, and iOS will take everyone else. There is no feature BB10 has that is drastically better than the other 3 so why would anyone choose it? WP7 has been out for 2yrs and is fighting for the same customers as BB10. They actually have phones out as opposed to waiting for 2013 and every Windows dev can make apps for them

C/C++, ActionScript, AIR, OpenGL, low level access, HTML5, Android player, multiple game kits,﻿ defactor standard push, multi-threaded, open source tool kits, multiple IDE, no cost to enter, great developer support. That's pretty nerdy.

I'm pretty﻿ sure Android has all of that also being open sourced and based on Linux and the dev tools are free too. The only real problem is fragmentation with low end phones using old OSes. I really doubt RIM will let you sideload apps not from their store or mod/install a whole new OS like Android does because they said they are worried about security?

Um genius, I was talking about phones regular people can actually buy in stores, not dev unit. They even said they are planning a 2013.
You still havent answered my question, why would anyone buy BB10 over iOS, Android, and WP, especially if they never used Blackberry?
If Palm couldn't succeed RIM sure as hell cannot.
Keep believing in RIM, the same company that said the Playbook would succeed, 'you don't need a camera on a phone', tried to﻿ compete with the iPhone using the Torch, etc.

You said "opposed to waiting for 2013﻿ and every Windows dev can make apps﻿ for﻿ them" genius... They made dev units. Why would they switch? BlackBerry 10 is revolutionary, and new. The difference between RIM and Palm is, Palm has debt RIM does not.
If they are dying, how come everyday their stock goes up?
How come they gained money this quarter and subscribers?
How come the number of applications they have are sky-rocketing up?
Answer my questions, this doesn't seem like a dying company bud...

It is easy to grow when your install base is 0. Have you forgotten that RIM used to own +50% of the smartphone market in the US and kept losing market share and PROFIT yr over yr to around 10% in US?
Blackberry market share keeps decreasing in every country, US, UK, etc aside from the 3rd world countries. If Palm had stuck with Palm OS they would be in the same﻿ spot RIM is at
It is dead simple to port a Win8 to WP8 app as opposed to making a BB10 app
"Revolutionary"? It has like 3new features!!

Oh sorry, I didn't mean to wake you from living under a rock.
If you checked their earnings call, you would have noticed that they gained subscribers and cash...
It is "dead simple" to port﻿ an application to BlackBerry 10, or make on from scratch.
I know because I have made on from scratch, and I'm working on another one right now.
Also, there have been testimonials of developers porting their very large applications in less then 24 hours, THAT is "dead simple". I doubt you are a dev though...

Do me a favor, go to RIM's stock page and look at its past 3months, then 6months, then 1yr, then 5yrs. You are all excited over a few days blip, maybe due to real sales in 1st world countries or just ppl remembering they still exist.
BB10 is too little too late, it will not be anywhere near as successful as iOS or Android. Maybe like the CEO said, they could be #3 and beat WP if lucky but﻿ they sure as hell are not going to be as successful as before selling $200-$300 phones to real everyday ppl

The greatest Tech comebacks come when investors can make a huge gain on low stock prices. Apple after a decade still has crap﻿ compatibility with Windows, 68.74% of the World uses a Windows OS. I see RIM making a comeback in the corporate community.

I think you mean 'Macs sell like crap compared with Windows'. Yeah that is true but Apple is still one of﻿ the top selling PC makers and they are targeting/dominate the luxury class PC market so they earn most of the PC profits.
The iPhone was a New Revolutionary device that changed the phone industry. BB10 is just a minor improvement so it will not give them Apple like profits. They are also seeking the same market customers and enterprise as WP, iOS, and Android

Do you think I'm stupid?
How is it a little "blip" when their stock has been up for almost 3 weeks now..
Their CEO said they would #3 because look at WP's position right now.
It isn't catching any attention because no one likes it.
How couldn't they beat Apple, their stock has been going DOWN for a while now.
Let's list this:
iPhone 5 most underwhelming release ever.
iOS has a ton of software issues, that still aren't fixed.
Has 500,000 application that no one at all has﻿ EVER seen before.

Everyone loves WP, go look at their reviews on Amazon. The only problem with WP is they have no apps bc their market is low bc they have no apps...
My point is having a superior﻿ product doesn't guaranty sales unless it is substantially superior like iOS vs Palm OS.
You are DELUSIONAL!! Again, look at their stock in yr mode, they are STILL GROWING.
APPL 661.61 vs RIMM 8.24

BB10 is substantially better than iOS, seeing as iOS has barely changed since 2007 and BB10 is offering a fresh, and awesome new operating system.

It's really only 9k people. Calm down man, I never said RIM should fall. I want there to be competition and inovation too but the market cannot support so many OSes as webOS has shown. It's just like the PC wars killing Be OS, Amiga, OS/2 and almost Apple. RIM can just do what Nokia did and use WP or Android. They make good hardware﻿ and enterprise apps so they'll be fine.

It doesn't need to be as 'successful' as iOS or﻿ Android - after all, Honda and Nissan aren't as 'successful' as GM and Toyota, but they still earn a profit, make great products, and provide the competition that forces GM and Toyota to keep improving.

I agree, that model used to work with dumbphones but smartphone, computers, and consoles are different. They all rely heavily on long term support from app developers. If the platform doesn't get enough good apps then fewer people will want to buy it and so devs are less attracted to making apps for the platform so fewer people will want it,﻿ etc, etc, etc.

It took more than 10 years for Steve Jobs to come up with the 1st iPhone.it didnt take world by﻿ storm when it came out,People still loved the BlackBerrys.There was so much that the iOS couldnt do until jailbreaking came alon.also that developers work their way around the OS to bring out features that came close to customers liking..iOS in its 5 years still haven't perfected multitasking as QNX has on PlayBook.RL It would only be a fair judge once the prouct is out and about for a couple of years

You are delusional if you think iPhone1 didn't change everything!! Ppl spent +$600 to get it, only old men who needed a keyboard and the poor stuck with RIM
Yes, iOS1 wasn't perfect but they kept updating their phones yr after yr to give them missing features like folders and AppStore.
From day﻿ 1 it had the superior web browser, maps, multitouch and C+ apps vs crappy Java

Exactly, Apple is starting from ground 0 with maps and so they will not be as good as a developed platform. Also I can still﻿ use Google maps from the website or an alternative app until Apple gets their maps in order so its no big deal.
Um, you do realize BB10 will not be using Google maps, they are also making their own.

...Um, iOS can do multitasking, but only necessary apps (like Instacast, Tom Tom) use it to save RAM, CPU, and battery unlike what Android does.
My point is iOS is out now and is going to keep getting better while BB10 has to compete with﻿ iOS/Android starting at ground 0. No one but RIM fanboys will spend $200 + contract and give BB10 a chance since it only has 3 advantages to iOS/Android and many uncertainties since it's not even out of beta.

When steve jobs got fired from apple he didn't pack it in and call it quits. He came back stronger and more brilliant then ever. This video﻿ shows they love what they do. Even if their company goes bankrupt, these aren't the type of people that call it quits. They go back to the drawling board and invent something more revolutionizing then before. Competition is what keeps our species evolving. Go Blackberry! you are brilliant men.

Like it or not, this video is doing exactly what they wanted. If you think they didn't have their tongues planted firmly in their cheek, you're kidding yourselves. Exposure and relevance through ridicule is still relevance and exposure. Dear detractors: your negative comments make anyone sitting on the fence want to give them a chance because they are now the﻿ underdog. That's just human nature. If you really want them to go away, say nothing, do not forward, dont help it go viral. OH! Too late!

Tongue in cheek or not; I didn't like the video. I don't think the idea was very original; nor was it﻿ executed very well. I would like to laugh at this; but it's just not funny. I guess that's just my opinion. I suppose I wish the folks at RIM good luck; although I personally can't see them making a comeback.

I'm using BlackBerry for 6 years and﻿ I know that this brand has never tricked or defrauded me with stupid and useless apps or such as a guy who said "it is not your darling , don't squeeze your phone and try to use it with your other hand".Yes , their servers has been collapsed for just 3 days in TWELVE YEARS and devices started to freeze after I used them for 2 years.For god sake I even can't put up with same girl for 2 year , stop denigrate them and change your bloody old phone with﻿ a new one

As I have no need for a business tool﻿ at this time, I am an Android junkie... However, when/if I ever delve into the world of business and/or IT again, BB will always going to be my choice for security and reliability.

This brought tears to my eyes. I had my lighter in the air as well singing along. I am a loyal blackberry user and can't wait until BB10 it﻿ will be do or die time. I hope you developers stick around and help RIM turn itself around. To all the Apple fanboys if you dislike BB then keep it to yourself but don't hate the song. Well done RIM.

I truly hope RIM/BB does get﻿ better and creates more competition in the market, but this is not the way to do it.
And it’s OK for everyone to hammer Apple/Apple fans for whatever they like, but as soon as they return fire, that’s not OK? Double-Standards?

Me thinks that the negative comments are from people in the US where RIM just doesn't matter anymore. Fortunately, while people in the US think the world revolves around them, in﻿ the rest of the world Blackberry's are growing. Hence the reason that they are making money despite the fact that they haven't made a new phone in 2 years. Anyone who understands businuess can tell you RIM is far from dead (not that they are doing well, but they aren't close to dying just yet).

There have actually been about a dozen new BlackBerry phone models in the last 2 years. OS 7 and OS 7.1 were released in 2011 and 2012 respectively and are a significant advance on OS 4 and OS 5, which older phones still use. OS 7 models are still selling well, especially﻿ in the Asian and South African markets, among others.

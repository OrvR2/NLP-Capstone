5daysagoPolice: Brazil nightclub fire kills at least 233A fire broke out early Sunday morning at a night club in Santa Maria, in southern Brazil, killing revelers — many of them students. NBC's Mike Taibbi reports. By Jeff Black, Staff Writer, NBC NewsUpdated at 1:23 a.m. ET: At least 233 people were killed after a band’s fireworks show sparked a rapidly moving fire in a packed nightclub in southern Brazil and fleeing patrons were unable to find their way out, local police said.Follow @NBCNewsWorld
 The bodies removed from the Kiss nightclub in the southern city of Santa Maria were taken to the Municipal Sports Center gymnasium for identification, police said.Major Gerson da Rosa Ferreira, who led rescue efforts at the scene for the military police, told Reuters that the victims died of asphyxiation or from being trampled. Police Maj. Cleberson Braida Bastianello told the Associated Press by telephone that the toll had risen to 233 with the death of a hospitalized victim.

Officials earlier counted 232 bodies that had been brought to the gymnasium in Santa Maria.In addition to the number of deaths, more  than 100 people were injured, police said, and most remain hospitalized. Police officials had reported earlier in the day that 245 people were  killed. The  death toll could still rise, police said later, from the  people who are  injured.Fire brigade colonel Guido Pedroso de Melo told O Globo newspaper that rescuers had difficulty entering the premises because of "a barrier of bodies" at  the entrance to the club.Television footage monitored by Reuters overnight showed people crying outside the club as shirtless firefighters used sledge hammers and axes to knock down an exterior wall to open up an exit. Agencia RBS via APPeople help a man injured in a nightclub fire in Santa Maria city, Brazil, on Sunday.Rodrigo Moura, who the newspaper Diario de Santa Maria identified as a security guard at the club, said it was at its capacity of between 1,000 and 2,000 people and patrons were pushing and shoving to escape, the AP reported. Police estimated the crowd at some 900 revelers.Fire officials said at least one exit was locked and that club bouncers, who at  first thought those fleeing were trying to skip out on bar tabs, initially  blocked patrons from leaving, Reuters reported.The club's management said in a statement it would help authorities with their investigation, Reuters reported.One of the club's owners has surrendered to police for questioning, GloboNews TV reported. "It was really fast. There was a lot of smoke, really dark smoke," survivor Aline Santos Silva, 29, told Globonews TV. "We were only able to get out quickly because we were in a VIP area close to the door." President Dilma Rousseff cut short a visit to Chile and visited families of the victims at the Municipal Sports Center, where relatives were gathering to identify the bodies. She met with relatives of the injured at Hospital de Caridade de Santa Maria.Rousseff declared a national three-day mourning period for victims of the fire. “Sad Sunday!” Tarso Genro, the governor of Rio Grande do Sul state where the club is located, tweeted. “We are taking all of the possible and appropriate actions,” the tweet read, according to a rough translation by NBC News. “I will be in Santa Maria later this morning.”The precise cause of the fire was still under investigation, authorities said. But Luiza Sousa, a civil police official in Santa Maria, told Reuters that the blaze started when someone with the band ignited what was described as a flare, which then set fire to the ceiling. The fire spread "in seconds," Sousa said. The tragedy in Brazil recalled other nightclub disaster. A fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in 2003 killed 100 people after pyrotechnics used on stage by the rock band Great White set ablaze foam used for soundproofing on the walls. A Buenos Aires nightclub blaze in 2004 killed nearly 200 people. Reuters noted that Brazil's safety standards and emergency response capabilities are under particular scrutiny as the country prepares to host the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Brazilian state’s Health secretary, Ciro Simoni, told the news service that emergency medical supplies from all over the state were being sent to the scene. Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Explore related topics: brazil, fire, nightclub, featured

Think WiseSanta Maria is in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, the last Brazilian state to the South.  I'm an American living in this region and unfortunately, little emphasis is put on safety in this country as a whole.  Health codes, building codes, driving rules are either non-existent or not adhered to.  Officials can easily be paid off and the result is tragedy.  We have our share fair of accidents and tragedies in the U.S. but here it's negligence and thoughtlessness.  It's a very sad day for so many lost lives and for the families and friends of the lost.  The 3rd world will remain 3rd world until the mentality and corruption changes.  Codes, laws and rules have to be in place to prevent these things.

It´s sad to read some of the opinions, but unfortunately I have to agree with some, especially Think Wise´s words.  People here don´t seem to care about safety anywhere: on the roads, at constructions sites, inside of public buildings... And there´s so much corruption that allows a lot of wrongdoing to happen.  You can, for example, get an operating license through a bribe, even if your establishment disrespect all kinds of law -  everything in the sake the well known old saying "money talks".  Definetely, a whole lot of changes need to take place before the World Cup and the Olympics!

I live in Northern Wisconsin and am constantly appalled that  ". . . .little emphasis is put on safety in this country as a whole. Health codes, building codes, driving rules are either non-existent or not adhered to."
I have yet to find any municipal officials, including police, willing to do their job and enforce state laws and local ordinances. I have tendered written complaints which include the specific laws and/or ordinances which are being violated. I have rarely succeeded in getting enforcement. Indeed, in one instance, the response of the city council was to abolish one of the ordinances in question. The arrogance is appalling. Just 2 days ago I watched a local cop blast through a school zone just as the kids were being dismissed. He has to be going at least 30 mph.
I have concluded pretty much everyone is on the take.

The plan review by the local fire marshal for Architectural drawings is critical as well as on site inspection by his office during construction. Fire prevention science is always improving if implemented correctly. The Rhode Island tragedy could have been mitigated if the owners had not locked a pair of egress doors on the side.
There also needs to be a material review for performance stages. If highly combustible material is used behind the stage, then Pyrotechnics cannot be used. These stage designers are not structural engineers and they are not fireproofing engineers. Why do they ignore the science and let people die for their own ignorant arrogance.

Actually indoor pyro is very safe when done properly, when was the last time you heard of a fire at a major concert or a Broadway production. The problem is when rookies and amateurs try to be heroes and don't know what they are doing. The station was a prime example and so is this. indoor pyro is very tightly regulated. In a proper venue like a real theater or concert halls that have high ceilings and fire retardant fittings these things don't happen. No flares of pre-manufacured pyrotechnics are used. Everything is very carefully weighed as far as lift charges and stars. The type of display stars used are very limited because many of the outdoor pyrotechnics give off poisonous gases and burn to hot for indoor use. Think of a Kiss concert or AC/DC with the propane cannon. Once in a very rare while a performer gets hurt because they lose their time and or place bearings and get burned by a firing pot. The pyro is part of a choreographed show. A bar or nightclub is no place for pyrotechnics of any kind unless it has a high ceiling, has been inspected and approved by the fire marshal and is set up and fired by a professional that knows exactly what they are doing.

Who in their right mind thinks a flare is a safe thing to set off for a pyrotechnics show. Maybe every show that will have them needs to be examined and deemed safe by someone who is a professional and then not deviated from and if they do deviate huge fines should be given. They should also have to pay a very large fee for the process to begin with. Then most would probably not use them. Open flame should never be an option in a public place especially one with so many people. The article doesn't say whether the band members got out or not. The man who set off the flare will have to live with the deaths of 245+ people and 200+ wounded of which many probably won't survive and many will be maimed for life. God Bless him as well as the lost.#1.64 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 6:38 PM ESTAntistupiditybobina519

The United States had two similar incidents where dozens of people died in stampedes within  week of each other ten years ago. The only reason why the Rhode Island tragedy wasn't as big as this one is because the club was smaller and therefore had fewer people. It was also a weekday, so there were fewer people there than on a weekend.
Might be time for bands to rethink their "setting off pyrotechnics in a small club with a low ceiling policy."#1.69 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:06 PM ESTjkfanIWonder....are you joking, or ARE you a joke? Do you just not care how idiotic you make yourself look as long as you THINK you are making the United States look bad? (newsflash...only YOU looked bad from your comment.)
Brazil NEEDS more people in jail. Their country is so overrun with crime that when The Simpsons did an episode about going to Brazil, and they showed lots of crime, and kidnappings as if it is an every day occurrence, the Brazilian government only took issue with them showing monkeys. The CRIME was fine. they had no problem with them showing the crime (since they know it is so bad.) but they were upset at the notion that there were monkeys running around the country.

The tragedy in Brazil recalled other nightclub disaster. A fire in West Warwick, Rhode Island, in 2003 killed 100 people after pyrotechnics used on stage by the rock band Great White set ablaze foam used for soundproofing on the walls. A Buenos Aires nightclub blaze in 2004 killed nearly 200 people.

Apparently, nightclubs didn't get the message about using pyrotechnics.

Nations that refuse to codify basic standards of living and their enforcement are the ones that need to step up to the plate.

Horse you rode in on...
How ridiculous, no taxes and no laws?? You wish! One thing for sure is that the liberal bent in this country has more to do with creating laws that try to control all levels of human endeavor, rather than just create laws to define socially acceptable actions.
As for your little firefighter story, nice try, but the homeowner made the decision to not support the fire dept and the community created the law that defined who qualified for fire protection.

If they could "Teach" common sense in schools it would be a fantastic thing but alas common sense is something that to few people end up having let alone understanding and that's a fact! 
If common sense were used every day by the majority of people, young and old alike, events like this one would be a thing of the past. But I'm afraid it will only get worse, common sense is gone as are morals, honesty, and so many other things that we used to cherish and revere in our daily lives.

FreemannogodYou lite a flare inside a closed building and your going to get a huge fire simple enough too say.
Why in a time when most of these clubs have plenty of new light shows used from techies but still insist on using cheap fire works?
I just don't get it, if this was outdoors then maybe, but inside with 500 people drinking and what not?

And a brain enough to know that it's all relative and that we can't go through life streaming tears for every human tragedy that occurs. We'd never get out of bed. We are a little more pragmatic and would like an actual solution to the gun violence problem before it does strike closer to home. I'm in the Denver area so Columbine and Aurora were both close to home for me. But so are all the daily smaller tragedies like the 2 month old shot in it's crib during a drive by or the father who kills his whole family on Christmas, or the other 2 dozen examples that happen in any big metro area through out the year.

There was enuff culpability to go around---criminal club owners (bribed) local fire officials (government union slime got off-of course!) and local corrupt D.A. did not investigate.....  Club owners also installed flammable "sound proofing" to quiet neighbor complaints.... Moron-roadies set off pyrotechnics INSIDE the dump, then security guards wouldn't let people exit the "STAGE DOOR"!  Scores were trampled trying to escape, and managers ran out saving themselves-- (everyman for himself here in corrupt Rhode Island!)--- w/o helping anyone.  They also installed shatter-proof glass to cut expenses.   Snow and ice covered the ground and it was late on a Saturday night.    State legislature (also refused to investigate much) over reacted making everyone install sprinkler systems--even if you were a stone church!  This forced many out of jobs and businesses closed (or bribed local officials).   Politicians like to force things on the public to make themselves "feel better"  or absolve their sins.  SAD.  SAD.

flylowguyLike many foreign locations,  and a few here in the U.S.,  they may as well hang signs on the walls that say "SAFETY LAST"#24 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:35 AM ESTAl KydaThat's a lot of dead for a single unfortunate incident.  The NRA can use this to support their argument that high-capacity magazines shouldn't be banned.  Killing over 200 people in a single shooting would be very tough, even with 100-round drums.  Cars, fires, accidents, etc., all kill far more people than guns in the US, so guns should therefore be as easy to own as sliced bread.  At least that's NRA logic.2 votes#25 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:37 AM ESTHairMetalRockerI really wish people would not spin every story to fit the political agendas in the United States. The world revolves around an axis, not the United States.
I understand that you may not be promoting the NRA, but simply by virtue of bringing it up you're part of the arrogance typical of people in the United States. It is that level of self-centeredness that makes Americans very unpopular around the world.9 votes#25.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:44 AM ESTLisa from Wayland...Al...it's too many people like you who give the liberals all the ammunition they need to prove that too many Americans are just too stupid to be trusted to run with scissors or handle anything that "goes boom" in any way.

This is about real people losing their lives in a needless fire.1 vote#25.2 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:57 AM ESTJoey BoLisa, tell that to the liberals who bring up gun bans whenever a shooting occurs.  Tell that to Obama.  If spinning didn't occur with every incident, then all you would hear is condolences from people.

This has everything to do with stupidity. If you use fire inside a building, there's a large risk that the building will catch fire. What is it about that simple fact that people don't get?
It is a wonder that humans are still at the top of the food chain.9 votes#27 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 9:39 AM ESTWiped&Ready200 plus people dead, more than that seriously injured by fire and smoke inhalation.
And all because some band couldn't play a show decent enough that they had to pump it up (or disguise their lack of talent) by using smoke and mirrors (and "pyrotechnics" inside a building that I'm sure was up to whatever fire-codes were in place for that area.)
This is why I stopped going to concerts that weren't staged outdoors. Or happened after midnight when the day-babies who've never worked a graveyard shift (like I have for over 25 years) come out and start acting like idiots because "Ooh, it's waaay past my bedtime, ooh I'm so cool!"#27.1 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 10:30 AM ESTJay-2150677Fist my condolences to all the people down there who lost their loved ones. Secondly, only a few comments into this tragedy, and the lunatics are already slamming Brasil and Brazilians as corrupt, inept, etc. Bribes? Yes, there is a lot of that going on down there, as everywhere else in the world. The difference is that in Brasil  it's all kept under the table.
Here in the US, where we are all perfect and beyond reproach, bribery is as much part of our daily lives as anywhere else. The difference is that here we call it "Lobbying". Now, with a pretty little term like that it's all good. And need I remind anyone about the Rhode Island fire a few years back that took 100 lives and left scores disfigured?
And to finalize, why are the right wing nuts complaining about the lack of oversight and regulations? Is this opposite day? Don't they want to live in Ayn Rand's paradise of no regulations and no government???
And Brasil is not a Third World country, and hasn't been one for decades now. But to expect the nutcases on the right to know that would be asking too much.3 votes#27.2 - Sun Jan 27, 2013 12:15 PM ESTComentator1What world do you live in???? Brazil is one of the most corrupt and greedy country in the world!!! Furthemore, FYI: Brazil is a third world country, all you hear about them doing great is not so! Their "GREAT" economy is a big farce, fake and it will all come crashing down as soon as the World Cup and Olympics are finished. There is much crime, poverty and misery everywhere!!! You should go down there and see for yourself! Don't just hide in your sanitized world and defend what you don't know. Shame on Brazil!!!#27.3 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:05 AM ESTnotatrollYes it happened in New York, I think. More than a hundred people died. But it was because some dude threw a flaming bottle as revenge. He only meant to scare but ended up killing over a hundred people. Very sad. Firefighters described finding the bodies to the gas chambers in the holocaust, as they struggled to get out and trampled each other. Frankly I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often, what with the non existent fire escape routes.#27.4 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 1:23 AM ESTJump to discussion page: 1 2 3 ...  14Leave a Comment:Name: Email Address (will be verified, but never shown): You're in Easy Mode.

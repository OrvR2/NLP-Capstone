Making Earthquakes' for RomneyBrent Bozell's column is released twice a week. By L. Brent Bozell | Brent Bozell III – Wed, Sep 26, 2012

After watching the national media's performance since the party conventions, one can only hope that college students are out on a summer safari or some Third World Peace Corps mission. Anything to avoid this mess. Sean Hannity is right. The establishment news media is dead. Whatever remains has only one standard. If it helps Obama, it's "news." If it doesn't, reporters should move on. There's nothing to observe here.
Our media doesn't just report "news" unfavorable to Romney. They obsess over it; complete with repetitive and thoroughly useless incantations that Romney's campaign is hopeless. On September 17, perhaps not accidentally after Team Obama started to struggle over their handling of the outrageous and deadly attack on the American consulate in Libya, the hard-left Mother Jones magazine leaked a secret tape of Romney talking to donors.
But what did he say? He told them Obama can count on 47 percent of the voters who will vote for him no matter what, "who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it." He added: "My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."
Impolitic? In a private meeting with donors, no. Untrue? Again, no. 
I will wager a million dollars that Barack Obama has held a meeting with his major donors where he has told them his job is not to worry about the 47 percent of greedy right-wing rich Republican voters who won't vote for him.
It's the way politicians talk to donors in private. The news media know this. That's why they're ignoring Obama and crucifying Romney.
Four years ago, in April of 2008, Obama was caught by The Huffington Post telling donors in San Francisco that small town Americans are "bitter" people who "cling to their guns or religion or antipathy towards people who aren't like them." This drew a few negative stories for a couple of days, but it quickly vanished from the media's campaign narrative as Obama secured his party's nomination.
This Romney tape was recorded in May, but the activists who recorded it obviously wanted to delay its release until the fall campaign. Once the radicals at Mother Jones posted it, on cue, the network carnival barkers started repeating after each other that this tape was a "bombshell" and an "earthquake" on a "seismic day" for the Republican campaign. A viewer might imagine the earth would open up and swallow Romney whole.
On CBS, Bob Schieffer was handing out the shovels to dig a grave for Romney. "I just can't think of anything that he could have said that could have hurt his cause more." I can. Another million-dollar wager here. There are going to be another one, or two, or three more "earthquake" moments for Romney. It could happen while he's brushing his teeth. It will happen whenever the media decides there's a new "earthquake."
There were 88 minutes of TV morning and evening news on this Romney tape on ABC, CBS and NBC. The networks were right. There was an earthquake — of their own making.
In response, the Romney team directed the networks to a 1998 tape of Obama where he professed his love for redistributing other people's money, solidifying the socialist agenda that Obama has so zealously denied. The networks gave this six and a half minutes of attention.
That's "fairness" to these TV people, a 13-to-1 advantage for Obama. So you say Romney's comments are much newer. Then consider the coverage of Obama's "Fast and Furious" scandal. On September 19, the Justice Department's inspector general released a scathing report on the government's incompetency that resulted in the death of an American border agent. The networks that devoted 88 minutes to Romney talking about government dependents voting for Obama gave this scandal just six minutes and 40 seconds of airtime. 
As usual on this scandal beat, CBS gave it most of the play, three minutes and 59 seconds. NBC allowed one minute and 44 seconds. ABC included a mere 61 seconds of anchor blather.
It must have been a joke for ABC morning anchor Amy Robach to announce: "And now to the big story in Washington" as  she gave it 26 seconds . We know by now that to these "news" manufacturers, nothing can be a "big story" unless it makes Obama look good and helps him win a second term.

Oh well.  "Live by the sword, die by the sword", as they say.

The media has controlled the narrative since before the Republican Primaries were decided.  They decided which of Romney's opponents got airtime and which didn't.  They decided who's campaigns were "finished" and who were the "rising stars".  They steered the debates to illuminate their chosen candidates- and doomed the others to obscurity.

Up until now, Romney has been the beneficiary of the media's narrative.  No one should act surprised now that the same media attention that got him the nomination is being used to sink his campaign.

The media is slowly poisoning its' brand. They will, unintentionally, paint Romney as a sympathetic figure because of their imbalance of coverage. Romney is gaining admiration via his perserverance despite all the negativity. He is proving to me he is a man of character.

The day Bozell takes Fox News to task for its 24/7 Romney-rama I might take him seriously in his criticism.  But he cherry picks the mainstream media for his attacks while ignoring the blatant bias of Fox.

It could be that since he's a talking head on Fox he doesn't see the obvious hypocrisy but I doubt it.  I'm sure he recognizes the discrepancy but chooses to ignore it hoping that readers will be so inflamed by "liberal" bias that they overlook the open campaigning for Romney and Republicans carried on by Fox's "fair and balanced" news teams.

When Mr. Bozell retires I wonder who will be there to pick up the torch complaining about everything that the media does? Also I wonder how he feels about himself since he too is part of the media?

Crybaby repulicans. The issue here is that Obama's comments were true. Since elected, there has been a surge in fire arm and ammo sales (clinging to guns) and a major oush towards illeagalizing or restrcting abortion, taking evolution out of the science class, and teaching creationist garbage in its place (clinging to bible). Anyone care to dispute these facts?

BOZO is apparently incontinent again and wanting to blame someone for the warm liquid in his shoes.

Ok, lots of parallels here :  

--When Obama made his comments that were leaked in in 2008, the Conservative voting bloc got very wound up and the whole "guns and bible" thing was a rallying point for Republicans...which the Democratic Party weren't going to convert anyway.  The liberals pretty much shrugged it off.  That left the folks in the middle, and, i guess,after an unsuccessful end to the Bush adminstration,  they went to Obama Campaign

--Cut to 2012....Romney comments leaked from a fundraiser.  47% of the voting population will shrug off the comments...another 47% will be outraged, but, had no intention of voting for him in the first place.  That leaves the folks in the middle and, unfortunately, the Romney campaign hasn't done a very good job of speaking to those 6%...

I'm just not sure that media bias had much to do with this....sorry

At least the Democrats "allowed" us to buy the unused AM radio stations. Can you imagine if the Democrat FCC had instead cause those "licenses" to lapse. I can, because the whole broadcast spectrum would be like ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS. The "Dan Rather" forged documents media was significantly different from the "Walter Cronkite" Goldwater will cause a nuclear war, media.

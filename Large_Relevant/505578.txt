Blog Posts by Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsINAUGURATION 2013: Michelle Obama steps out in style — and substance?By Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Jan 15, 2013Tweet0

When First Lady Michelle Obama joins her husband at his public inauguration next week, the most immediate question for many in the audience will be, “Who is she wearing?”
But while the first lady's style at the swearing in and balls will no doubt generate headlines, the occasion presents a larger question about what her role will be in her husband’s second term.
Michelle Obama's choice of attire are among the few genuine unknowns surrounding the President Barack Obama's second term inaugural. And while it may seem laughable to some, it’s an endorsement that could potentially mean millions of dollars in new business for a designer. Her decision to wear a flowing ivory gown by young designer Jason Wu to the inaugural balls four years ago made the young designer a major force in the fashion industry, which is watching Obama's 2013 choice closely.
“The inauguration is being anticipated almost like a

NARAL Pro-Choice America announced on Monday it has tapped longtime Democratic operative Ilyse Hogue to serve as its new president as the group seeks to appeal to a younger generation of pro-abortion rights supporters.
Hogue replaces outgoing president Nancy Keenan, who is leaving the post after eight years. In May, Keenan announced she would step down from the group after the 2012 election in order to bring in someone who could appeal to younger voters.

Dozens of commuters injured in NYC ferry crashBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Wed, Jan 9, 2013Tweet0

NEW YORK—A commuter ferry crashed as it was docking in lower Manhattan on Wednesday morning, injuring more than 70 passengers, two critically. The ferry was taking hundreds of commuters from the New Jersey shore into New York City's Wall Street area.
“It was like we ran into a concrete wall,” said Bill McKenzie, a 62-year-old bond broker commuting from his home in Highlands, N.J. “You’re never prepared for something like that. Bodies were just flying.”
The crash occurred at about 8:45 a.m. as the boat, operated by Seastreak Ferry, pulled into Pier 11 near Wall Street in lower Manhattan. The cause of the accident was not immediately clear, but a massive gash could be seen along the front right side of the boat.
Dozens of police and fire officials descended on the scene, as did workers from the American Red Cross, who were helping dazed passengers even as they were being questioned by investigators. Several passengers were seen being carried from the scene on flat boards, their heads and necks secured.
Officials said there were about 300 people on the boat, including five crew members. At least two passengers were critically injured with severe head trauma and nine others had serious injuries, according to New York City Fire Commissioner Joe Bruno.
Bruno said the boat's captain and other crew members were being interviewed by local authorities on the scene, and fire officials were preparing to turn over the scene to investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board. Officials said the pier would be closed until further notice.
Commuter Ashley Furman said the ferry had pulled into the pier as usual and that she and other passengers had stood up to prepare to disembark.
“I was talking to someone and the next thing I knew, I was on the ground,” Furman said, visibly shaken. “A woman was shaking me and asking me if I was OK, and I couldn’t breathe and I couldn’t speak."
Furman said she was thrown about six feet through the air. "I felt like I was in a movie," she said.

Group aims to improve New York’s ‘horrific’ airportsBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Wed, Jan 9, 2013Tweet0

NEW YORK—Flight delays have long been a fact of life at New York’s three main airports—along with massive security lines and crumbling facilities, many of which haven’t seen major updates since they were first built in the 1960s.
City, state and federal officials have been promising for decades to improve New York’s troubled airport system, but little has been done. Now, however, they're getting a major push from a prominent Manhattan developer, who has pledged to help fix what he describes as a “blight” on the city’s image.
Joseph Sitt, founder of Thor Equities in New York, has put up $1 million of his own money to launch the Global Gateway Alliance, an advocacy group that aims to push officials into improving New York’s airports.
Sitt, a frequent traveler who commutes worldwide developing real estate, retail and tourism projects, said he was inspired to act due to years of feeling “embarrassment” as he walked through John F. Kennedy International Airport after traveling to airports in cities like Paris and Dubai.
The difference between those airports and the ones in New York, Sitt told Yahoo News, is "horrific."
‘There, everything takes off and lands quickly because they have the best radar system. They have enough runway. There, you go through the security lines quickly and safely because they have enough people," he said. "The place looks physically beautiful… You’re impressed when you come in. You’re impressed when you leave."

Chris Christie vows to make Sandy recovery his top priorityBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Jan 8, 2013Tweet0
Chris Christie (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, speaking in his annual State of the State address against the backdrop of a potentially divisive election year, vowed he will rise “above politics” and make storm recovery his biggest priority.
The governor, who predicted it will take “years” to rebuild homes and infrastructure damaged by Superstorm Sandy, praised officials who moved “across party lines” to help New Jersey in its aftermath. Their actions, he said, are an example of what can happen when politicians put political bickering aside.
“One thing I hope everyone now clearly understands—New Jersey, both Republicans and Democrats, will never stand silent when our citizens are being short-changed,” Christie said. "Some things are above politics. Sandy was and is one of those things."
Christie, who again called on Congress to pass a Sandy relief bill, acknowledged that the toughest part of recovery is still ahead.

NYC’s Mayor Bloomberg still looking for big name successor at City HallBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Jan 8, 2013Tweet0
Ed Rendell and Mayor Bloomberg in 2008 (Alex Wong/Getty Images)NEW YORK—Michael Bloomberg apparently still isn’t happy with the list of people looking to succeed him as mayor of New York City.
Last month, it emerged that Bloomberg had unsuccessfully tried to convince Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to replace him at City Hall when his third term expires later this year. But that didn’t discourage him from trying to woo other high-profile figures.
The New York Times reports Tuesday that Bloomberg and his aides have “floated the possibility of a mayoral run” to four other “boldface” names—including New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, media mogul Mort Zuckerman, former Bloomberg deputy mayor Edward Skyler and former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who previously was mayor of Philadelphia.
“The mayor believes he is special,” Rendell tells the Times. “He wanted somebody at a very high level to come in to do a job he has often said to me—and he’s not the only person who says it—is the second most difficult job in the country.”

Bloomberg advising White House on gun legislationBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Mon, Jan 7, 2013Tweet0

“We sent some of our people down to Washington, and we had some people on the phone to give Joe Biden our ideas,” Bloomberg said at a press conference on Monday.
It was unclear if Bloomberg had spoken to Biden or President Barack Obama directly about looming gun legislation. Bloomberg, who has emerged as one of the most vocal advocates of new gun laws, did not say, and a spokesman referred to the mayor’s statement when asked directly.
Bloomberg’s comments come after the Washington Post reported Sunday that Biden and a White House working group charged with coming up with new gun measures is planning a “far broader and more comprehensive” approach than previously anticipated in an attempt to curb gun violence.

Parents of kids allegedly killed by nanny speak out on FacebookBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Mon, Jan 7, 2013Tweet0
NEW YORK—The parents of two young children killed last fall allegedly by their nanny are speaking out publicly for the first time about their loss, saying they draw strength to go on from their surviving 4-year-old daughter.
Kevin and Marina Krim, whose children Lucia "Lulu", 6, and Leo, 2, were found stabbed to death in their Manhattan home last October, write on a Facebook page established in their kids’ honor that their daughter, Nessie, is helping them to recover from their heartbreaking loss.
“She is very smart, beautiful and tough,” Kevin Krim, a CNBC media executive, wrote in a message on Facebook. “She’s grown so much over the past two months. She saves us every day.”

Bloomberg: Media need to rethink gun violence coverageBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! NewsSenior Political ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Holly Bailey, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Jan 4, 2013Tweet0

NEW YORK—New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the media need to improve their coverage of gun violence, arguing the press pays attention to gun-related deaths only after mass shootings.
In an interview with NBC’s Jimmy Fallon, Bloomberg called the Dec. 14 shooting that killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., “terribly tragic,” but said there is scant coverage of people who are killed by guns every day.
“This was a crazy person with an assault weapon,” Bloomberg said of the Sandy Hook shooting. “But there’s 33 people killed in America with guns every single day of the year. And nobody seems to care. It only catches the press’s attention when it’s young kids concentrated. And it was terribly tragic, but there are kids killed every day all across this country.”

NEW YORK—New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg held a private meeting Wednesday with former Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who nearly lost her life when she was shot in the head at point blank range at a constituent meeting two years ago.
The sit-down, which wasn’t listed on Bloomberg’s public schedule, was first confirmed via the mayor’s office Twitter feed, which posted a photo of Bloomberg and his aides meeting with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly.
Marc LaVorgna, a spokesman for Bloomberg, told Yahoo News it was the first time Bloomberg and Giffords had met in person and they talked for "nearly an hour." He declined to say specifically what they discussed. But a source told the New York Post that the group talked about Bloomberg's efforts to pressure President Barack Obama and Congress to pass tougher gun control laws in the wake of last month's deadly school shooting in Newtown, Conn--a message that has been echoed by Giffords and Kelly.

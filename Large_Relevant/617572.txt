DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — A fire swept through a two-story garment factory in Bangladesh's capital, killing at least seven female workers and injuring five others, police and fire officials said.
The fire Saturday at the Smart factory occurred just two months after a blaze killed 112 workers in another factory near the capital, raising questions about safety standards and treatment of workers in Bangladesh's $20 billion garment industry that exports clothes to leading Western retailers. The country has more than 4,000 garment factories.
The cause of the latest fire was not immediately known, fire official Abdul Halim said.
Dhaka Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Monzurul Kabir said the bodies of seven women were recovered from the top floor of the factory in Dhaka's Mohammadpur district. He said the factory was making pants and shirts, but could not provide further details.
Halim said it took firefighters about two hours to bring the blaze under control.
Volunteers joined firefighters in battling the fire as a large crowd gathered outside the factory awaiting word on the fate of relatives. Family members were seen crying near the body of a female worker named Josna, who was only 16.
Earlier this month, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. alerted its global suppliers that it will immediately drop them if they subcontract their work to factories that haven't been authorized by the discounter. The stricter contracting rule, along with other changes to its policy, come amid increasing calls for better safety oversight after the deadly fire in late November at a factory owned by Tazreen Fashions Ltd. that supplied clothing to Wal-Mart and other retailers. Wal-Mart has said the factory wasn't authorized to make its clothes.
Wal-Mart ranks second behind Swedish fast fashion retailer H&M in the number of clothing orders it places in Bangladesh. Before the November fire, Wal-Mart had taken steps to address safety, such as mandating fire safety training for all levels of factory management.
Building fires have led to more than 600 deaths of garment workers in Bangladesh since 2005, according to research by the advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.

What safety standards and treatment of the workers ??????????
It is a SWEAT SHOP PERIOD !!!!!!!  For a dime a day you work till you drop and they bring in another slave to replace you. The selfish and greedy do not know what safety rules and good treatment of workers is. Let alone practice it.

People can afford custom made. Your clothes will last longer and you're creating American jobs. The problem is people don't WANT to pay more. They don't want to shop LESS. They don't want to learn to sew and repair like my grandmother did in her day. They don't want to spend money on quality on the home front. So stop your preaching, you could pay an American tailor to make you a shirt as opposed to spending five bucks on one from Bangladesh, you just CHOOSE not to. Stop preaching unless you buy clothes from a tailor, made from textiles produced in America, created from cotton/materials grown here.

I guess they didn't enforce the safety laws after that first horrible fire.  How many more need to die before safety is enforced?

A worker in one of these factories earns less per month than what a worker in the States earned per day that was why these jobs were outsourced, but did anybody notice that the price of the item remained the same.

What a shame.  Lets see how fast the retailers will disavow all affiliation with this garment factory, again.

Can we just move these garment factories back here to the USA...?
I'll gladly pay a bit more for an American made product where the workers will have safe and nicer working conditions, plus we'll have a lot more jobs. 

Walmart, Target, Kohl, JC Penny, Sears, Ross, Macy's, and you other companies, well, can ya lend a hand here...?

Human life is irrelevant.  All that matters is making more $$$.  Didn't you know?

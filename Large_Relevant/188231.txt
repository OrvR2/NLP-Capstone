He's right you know, you are a sick, evil cunt.
You have no compassion for fellow human beings and actually appear to take pleasure in their deaths because they dont live and believe in the same way as you?
I find your attempt to assert your moral superiority, as morally repugnant and a grotesque example of religious thinking which is sadly all too common.
In short, you are the devil.

Why do religious right-wing nut-jobs need an military-style arsenel? Why are they not trained to handle guns before they are eligable to buy them? why are they not psychiatricly evaluated beforehand? when was the last time someone had to defend their family from more burglars, robbers, etc, than the number of bullets a standard gun magazine?
if you want guns to protect your home/property then that's where they should stay - as soon as the gun leaves the house, then you should go to prison.

Guerrilla film-making rocks!  It doesn't matter if Disney makes sure no-one outside sundance doesn't see the film, the fact that he got it made and made it into the Sundance line-up means we'll be seeing and hearing from him again (in fact, it'll probably be Disney who sign him up to a deal with Mirimax).

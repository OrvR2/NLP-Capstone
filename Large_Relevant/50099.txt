Firefighters take part in a moment of silence outside Sandy Hook Elementary School. (Dylan Stableford)
NEWTOWN, Conn.—Bells rang out here and across the country 26 times following a moment of silence on Friday morning, one week after a gunman opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing 20 children and 6 adults in one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.
Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy ordered the statewide moment of silence to occur at 9:30 a.m., “exactly one week after the horror began to unfold.” Malloy took part in the symbolic gesture at Edmond Town Hall on Main Street in Newtown as rain poured down outside. Across Main Street, church bells tolled at Trinity Episcopal Church, where the funeral service for 6-year-old Benjamin Wheeler was held the day before.
At the entrance to Sandy Hook Elementary, across the street from the volunteer firehouse where children and their parents were reunited on the day of the shootings, faint bells could be heard in the distance. About 40 people, including several firefighters, stood silently in the rain and wind—so strong that it knocked down two of the 26 Christmas trees that line the road—at one of the many makeshift memorials that dot the small town of 27,000. A therapy dog, one of dozens sent to Newtown to comfort residents in the wake of the shootings, stood with its handler nearby.
Three firefighters from Sandy Hook Fire and Rescue cried while they hugged each other. No one spoke.
Bells could also be heard at Saint Rose of Lima Church on Church Hill Road, where many of the funerals for the victims have been held. Funerals for more victims were scheduled later Friday.
In Washington, D.C., President Barack Obama took part in the moment of silence privately, the White House said.
Online, scores of websites went dark for several minutes to honor the victims.
The gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, killed his 52-year-old mother,  Nancy Lanza, at their Newtown home before his attack at the school.
After the moment of silence, a Sandy Hook resident walking away from the firehouse said: "Maybe now we can begin to heal."

In their memory:  
IN THERE MEMORY

Twas 11 days before Christmas, around 9:38
When 20 beautiful children stormed through heaven's gate.
Their smiles were contagious, their laughter filled the air.
They could hardly believe all the beauty they saw there.
They were filled with such joy, they didn't know what to say. 
They remembered nothing of what had happened earlier that day.
"Where are we?" asked a little girl, as quiet as a mouse.
"This is heaven," declared a small boy. " We're spending Christmas at God's house."
When what to their wondering eyes did appear,but Jesus, their Savior, the children gathered near.
He looked at them and smiled, and they smiled just the same.
Then He opened His arms and He called them by name.
And in that moment was joy, that only heaven can bring. 
Those children all flew into the arms of their King and as they lingered in the warmth of His embrace,
one small girl turned and looked at Jesus' face. 
And as if He could read all the questions she had
He gently whispered to her, "I'll take care of mom and dad."
Then He looked down on earth, the world far below
He saw all of the hurt, the sorrow and woe. 
Then He closed His eyes and He outstretched His hand,
"Let My power and Presence re-enter this land!"
"May this country be delivered from the hands of fools!"
"I'm taking back my nation. I'm taking back my schools!"
Then He and the children stood up without a sound.
"Come now my children, let me show you around."
Excitement filled the space, some skipped and some ran.
All displaying enthusiasm that only a small child can.
And I heard Him proclaim as He walked out of sight,
" In the midst of this darkness, I AM STILL THE LIGHT."

Sure Gun Control Works. Here’s some History:

In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated.

China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians unable to defend themselves es, were rounded up and
exterminated.

Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million ‘educated ‘ people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century
because of gun control: 56 million.

The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, please remind people of history.

I guess buying guns is stupid? In Oklahoma a Teen mom Shot and Killed Intruder to Protect her Three-Month-old Baby. A 14-year-old Phoenix boy shot an intruder who broke into his home while brandishing a gun as the teenager watched his three younger siblings.11-year-old Alyssa Gutierrez, used one of her family’s guns to defend herself and her family’s house when three armed burglars
attempted to break in while young Alyssa was home alone.A 16-year-old boy from Caledon saved the lives of his parents, shooting dead an armed intruder who attacked the family.
Thank You NRA and all other Second Amendment groups.

Heal?  Not as long as political mileage can be cranked out.  Don't worry, though, something else worse will come along and distract our national attention.

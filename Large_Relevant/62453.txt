Hi. I’m a 14 year old DJ/Producer with 1 year experience. I know there’s a lot of comments like these and this can frustrate some people. We only have one shot at life and this is what I would like to do with it. It means the world to me if you check out my channel and﻿ music. I have only been producing for 1 year so I’m not at a professional level. In a years time? you wont be disappointed
Please like this comment so people can see. Just one click can change my life.
Thanks so much for your time

So basically, I bet my friend that I could hit 200 subs in two weeks. I thought to myself, why not do a little two week challenge? So I came up with this. I’ll be uploading a short song of a different genre every single day for two weeks. Today’s genre is orchestral. If you like orchestral, make sure you don’t miss it! If not then﻿ why not check out my two new electronic songs? Thanks for the support, appreciated.

I'll go ahead and give you﻿ a thumbs down for being a begging spamming faggot. Seriously do these idiots who spam their shitty electronic music on popular videos ever stop and think spamming wont make them famous, good music will speak for itself and make them famous. There's a reason why you are spamming, cause your shit sucks and you're desperate. Only way to make it is to be good at what you do, and people will take notice. Now stfu you begging BITCH!

Predictable response. You can beg me to suck a dick (or your dick) as much as you want, but it doesn't change the fact that you are a pathetic spammer.﻿ Get good at music and you won't have to beg for people to like your music, end of story, tough love.

Hi. I’m a 14 year old DJ/Producer with 1 year experience. I know there’s a lot of comments like these and this can frustrate some people. We only have one shot at life and this is what I would like to do with it. It means the world to me if you check out my channel and music. I have only been producing for 1 year so I’m not at a professional level. In a years time? you wont be disappointed
Please like this comment so﻿ people can see. Just one click can change my life.
Thanks so much for your time

Hey guys, Sorry but this IS spam, I know it sucks..
I’m Ezra, a man on a mission, I make my own genre of music. I’m trying to reach 50’000 views and 3000 subs by the end of the year, but it’s tough when my way to get views is asking random people for help.
So I’m asking you to check out 1 of my songs,﻿ I’m not asking much I mean you can’t be that busy, you’re on YouTube
Thanks for reading and probably leaving horrible hate messages, which is fair enough spam sucks and I’m sorry for that.

Hey guys,﻿ Sorry but this IS spam, I know it sucks..
I’m Ezra, a man on a mission, I make my own genre of music. I’m trying to reach 50’000 views and 3000 subs by the end of the year, but it’s tough when my way to get views is asking random people for help.
So I’m asking you to check out 1 of my songs, I’m not asking much I mean you can’t be that busy, you’re on YouTube
Thanks for reading and probably leaving horrible hate messages, which is fair enough spam sucks and I’m sorry for that.

Hey people!
I'm 15 years old and I make electronic music
I'm new to this whole music thing but﻿ I've been getting really good feedback; However I can still improve loads.
This is where you come in. I'm not asking you to sub me or thumbs up this comment, just to give my new song a quick listen and tell me how to improve.
Right now all I want is to become the best I can be, then I'll ask you to sub ;)
Thank you,
Tom Vandenberk

Hey guys, Sorry but this IS spam, I know it sucks..
I’m Ezra, a man﻿ on a mission, I make my own genre of music. I’m trying to reach 55’000 views and 3000 subs by the end of the year, but it’s tough when my way to get views is asking random people for help.
So I’m asking you to check out 1 of my songs, I’m not asking much I mean you can’t be that busy, you’re on YouTube
Thanks for reading and probably leaving horrible hate messages, which is fair enough spam sucks and I’m sorry for that.

Hey guys! I am a twelve year old dubstep producer, but don't under estimate me because of my age! I had been﻿ making dubstep for almost a year now and I feel I have good production quality! Don't get me wrong though, Skrillex was my inspiration and i love all his songs :D

Hey guys, Sorry but this IS spam, I know it sucks..
I’m Ezra, a man on a mission, I make my own genre of music. I’m trying to reach 55’000 views and 3000 subs by the end of the year, but it’s tough when my way to get views is asking random people for help.
So I’m asking you to check out 1 of my songs, I’m not asking﻿ much I mean you can’t be that busy, you’re on YouTube
Thanks for reading and probably leaving horrible hate messages, which is fair enough spam sucks and I’m sorry for that.

99,9% of "people"? If by "people" you mean the people of the whole world, you are mistaking. Saying 99,9% of people won't read it, basically means everyone in the world won't read it, but since﻿ you are commenting that exact same comment on all Skrillex's videos there is a 100% chance someone will read it.

Hey guys, Sorry but this IS spam, I know it sucks..
I’m Ezra, a man on a mission, I make my own genre of music. I’m trying to reach 50’000 views and 1000 subs by the end of the year, but it’s tough when my way to get views is asking random people for﻿ help.
So I’m asking you to check out 1 of my songs, I’m not asking much I mean you can’t be that busy, you’re on YouTube
Thanks for reading and probably leaving horrible hate messages, which is fair enough spam sucks and I’m sorry for that.

Hello. I'd like to welcome you to the world.
Hating people of a higher socioeconomic status that you only incites class warfare, which can severely inhibit the willingness of the "privileged white people" you﻿ hate so much to enact political policies that could help you.
In other words, don't give the people on top reasons to hate you, dipshit.

I advocate class warfare! Don't tell him not offend these "privileged white people"! These rich white kids have probably been so brainwashed by the corporate controlled bourgeois media that glorifies capitalist consumerism and censors all the suffering caused by it in the rest of the world that they wouldn't care or know about those less privileged then them! Even when they naïvely think they are helping "starving Africans" they are actually not﻿ *cough* Kony. Chang shall not come from above!

Hey guys, Sorry but this IS spam, I know it sucks..
I’m Ezra, a man on a mission, I make my own genre﻿ of music. Im trying to reach 50’000 views and 1000 subs by the end of the year, but its tough when my way to get views is asking random people for help.
So Im asking you to check out 1 of my songs, I’m not asking much I mean you can’t be that busy, you’re on YouTube.
Thanks for reading and prob leaving horrible hate messages, which is fair enough spam sucks and I’m sorry for that.

Drumstep is better. It hits harder and the base drops are a﻿ lot more enjoyable.
P.S. Skrillex - Summit is not Dubstep.

I swear in this song there are two versions. If you listen closely, there'll be a "creep, creep" followed﻿ by "breathe, breathe." I'm almost positive the latter is breathe (the remix is called breathe).

Not trying to be rude, so feel free to ignore this message, it bothered a lot of comments, but it is my only means of promotion
I am a﻿ producer of dubstep /﻿ electro trying to get followers on YouTube. I know﻿ there are a lot of dubstep producers, but I try to highlight.
I am doing collaborations with other famous artists in the world of electronics and new genres and I﻿ would like you please sit down and telling me what you think watching my videos.
Thank you very much. Rubsstep

Hey I’m Ezra.
Sorry, this IS spam. If spam annoys you don’t read anymore!
I make D&B Dubstep and mainly my own genre, I’ve been making music for about 8 months now and I’ve already reached over 14’000 views and 500 subscribers, that’s more than I thought I’d get but to﻿ turn my hobby into a career I need a lot more.
My goal this year is to reach 50’000 views and 1000 subscribers and I can’t reach my goal without YOUR help.
You don’t have to like me, just give me a chance to be liked
Thank You!

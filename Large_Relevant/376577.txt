For those who're interested you can read more about how much of an effect Chinese "medicine" is having on endangered species in Africa. Vice did an excellent piece on the rhino horn trade just the other day. Just search for the title "The Rhino Horn Crisis and the Darknet". I should warn you, it shows a very small amount of gore by showing a picture of a rhino that had its horn sawed off by poachers.

There's been a population explosion even in rural regions as a result of scientific progress. Just because their ancestors coexisted for thousands of years around manatees does not mean their descendants aren't a threat to them now. Just look at how our closest relatives are endangered in Africa if you do not believe me. People need to seriously look at limiting the number of children they have.

What I can't figure out is why there is serious opposition to such things as the living wage. It would broaden the tax base, and enable kids to go to college easier. Furthermore I do not understand why we don't have a program to subsidize the education of those who follow the STEM track, provided it is through a process akin to civil service so that they stay in the nation for the following decade. That way we can truly rebuild the middle class for the future.

Pretty sure we've never recognized them as such in the modern era. As for whether or not we can or not, where did you get the idea that we can't? The question is whether we should or should not do so, not whether we have the ability to do so or not. As I mentioned already I'm pretty sure tribal law is subject to constitutional law. So they're not independent nations, but what amounts to unique counties / parishes.

Technically you can alter how a business operates through the mass purchase of stocks by many different people, and then having them elect a proxy representative/s to represent them on the board of directors. But that requires a rather concerted effort with lots of money backing it, and even then it isn't guaranteed to work if you can't get enough votes to push your way.

The first book in the Sleeping Beauty trilogy starts with an act of rape, Beauty doesn't truly have a choice in being taken away. Sheďťż is nothing more than the property of the Prince, and her parents. I guess the fact that it is a take on a medieval fable is somehow supposed to assuage any discomfort we might have. Despite being already a little under a fifth of the way in, I'm hoping for a daisy cutter to be dropped on all the miserable lot. Anne Rice did such a great job.

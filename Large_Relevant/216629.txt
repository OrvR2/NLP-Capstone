Taking to the world's biggest bully pulpit
 


There are podiums, and then there is this...

Five challenges facing Obama


Obama v the gun lobby



 The US president rounded off his second and last inauguration day with the troops, at the commander-in-chief's ball. 
Even here, speaking down a link to soldiers in Afghanistan, his mind was on the home front - assuring them they would be looked after when they came home, given a heroes' welcome.  
He does not want any new foreign wars, but he has signalled he is ready for a series of monumental fights at home. 
He has used the biggest bully pulpit he will ever get to punch home a feisty message that contained not an ounce of compromise.
When Teddy Roosevelt, who was president from 1901-09, spoke of the White House "bully pulpit" he didn't mean "bully" as in "pushing people around", but simply the old-fashioned sense of "fantastic", enormous" and "unbeatable". 
President Barack Obama seems to agree this ability to preach to a nation is the source of his power, really his biggest weapon.
Fire in the belly
His speech has delighted most supporters, linking their philosophy - liberal, progressive, call it what you like - with America's most cherished values.
The framework of the speech was the argument that the ringing words of the founding fathers find real expression in his values. 
But it was more than abstract argument. For anyone who has missed it so far, his re-election has put fire in the president's belly. 
Gone were the aspirations of 2009 for a new, harmonious, purple politics where men and women put aside partisan politics and seek common ground. 
Once more he punched home his priorities: immigration reform, protecting the elderly and the sick, investing in schools and roads and gun control. 
His shout out for "gay brothers and sisters" has enraged conservatives. 
Adding climate change to his already long "to do" list shows this man does not expect a quiet life. 
As he sat down, supporters were getting emails urging them to join a new campaign, not this time to win an election, but to fulfil its promise. 
It is not easy to see how even the most enthusiastic support of Democrats earns him Republican votes in the House - perhaps by dividing moderates off from the rest in the face of public opinion; perhaps it's about the mid-terms in 2014. 
But this president is loving the bully pulpit and he is not about to climb down.

BluesBerry  23rd January 2013 - 13:40   Obama believes he has this great ability to preach; it's his power, his weapon.  So, why am I finding it so hard to listen to him anymore? Is it because I find more empty rhetoric, like eating a stew & finding no meat. He who issues Executive Orders, bypasses Congress, has the gall to refer to founding fathers. Re-election has given him the gall.    Report this comment (Comment number 175) Link to this (Comment number 175)     Comment number 174.

Northern1  23rd January 2013 - 12:54   We've many more years of America as top dog yet. Think about the Great Game and the Crimean War. Britain was the preminant world power, yet in popular opinion Russia was a threat to that position despite in reality being a second rate power which never truely threatened the global hegemon. The USA faces the challenges of a mature economy and though it may share the stage it is still No.1.

Martin  23rd January 2013 - 12:06   The GOP should return to its roots. It was key the fight against discrimination (slavery) in the past, and it should be fighting discrimination now, not actively discriminating against the poor or the non-heterosexual population.

Lafayette  23rd January 2013 - 11:52   Funny how Republicans forget:Osama Bin Laden is dead, GM is alive, and the economy is recovering.

DD2000  23rd January 2013 - 11:42   I guess the "reaching out across the divide" and being " bipartisan" in his second term are just more smoke and mirrors.If he had be elected by a landslide like Regan then he could be in a position to be a "bully".  But he wasn't and he did even win control of  congress.So "Bully" is a good word - somebody who's over inflation of their self worth causes them to push others around.

Chris London  23rd January 2013 - 11:34   Well Obama doesn't have to worry about being tagged as a bully or even forcing his views on other countries for he has been the most un-influential President the USA has had the honour of electing. He has delivered on non of his pledge, lets face it Guantanamo is still there and that should have been one of the most easy political pledges to keep.

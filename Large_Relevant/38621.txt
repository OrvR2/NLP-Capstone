Blog Posts by Chris Moody, Yahoo! NewsHouse approves funding for Sandy insurance claimsBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! NewsPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Fri, Jan 4, 2013Tweet0
Still under pressure to provide federal aid to victims of Superstorm Sandy, the House on Friday voted to increase the borrowing limit for the National Flood Insurance Program, which will pay out 140,000 insurance claims for property damage.
The federal program offers subsidized insurance plans to homeowners who live near the nation's coasts, and it was on track to run out of money by next week if Congress did not act. The payouts in the bill will cost the federal government $9.7 billion.
Local leaders from areas hit hardest by the storm were outraged this week that the congressional vote on the extended funding did not come sooner.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Thursday lashed out at Congress for failing to act, placing particular blame on House Speaker John Boehner.
"There's only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these  innocent victims, the House majority and their speaker, John Boehner,"  Christie said.
Now that the bill has passed the House, the Senate intends

WASHINGTON—Despite nine defections from fellow Republicans, Ohio Rep. John Boehner was re-elected as speaker of the House Thursday in a voice vote.
Boehner won the backing of 220 Republicans, who retained a majority in the chamber after November's election. But a handful of GOP members voted no or abstained. Most Democrats voted for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
Boehner's grasp on his speakership seemed tenuous going into the vote.
The Ohio congressman has come under fire from conservatives in recent weeks for  supporting a "fiscal cliff" deal with President Barack Obama that allowed tax rates to  increase. He allowed a vote on a package brokered by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Vice President Joe Biden that most House Republicans opposed. The bill passed Tuesday with the support of Democrats.
Several northeastern Republicans loudly criticized Boehner for stalling a $60 billion relief bill for states hit by Superstorm Sandy. Boehner has pledged to hold a vote on

WASHINGTON—With temperatures dropping below freezing here Thursday, members of the 113th Congress met for the first time for a day packed with tradition, pictures with their families and votes on leaders and rules that will guide the chamber for the next two years.
"It's so cold out here! Wow!" Maryland Democratic Rep. Donna Edwards said as she charged up the marble steps of the Capitol. She had just joined dozens of other women for a special photo opp with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on the Capitol steps to celebrate the largest class of female lawmakers in history.
The new Congress features 90 new faces in the House and Senate.
The House side of the Capitol was abuzz with freshmen—some excited, others downright anxious—as they wandered the halls and tunnels of their new home. Elevators full of children and bright-eyed new members creaked up and down the floors of the Capitol building throughout the day.

After ‘fiscal cliff’ drama, Republicans take it easy at closed-door meetingBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! NewsPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Jan 2, 2013Tweet0
WASHINGTON--Finally, a night of calm on Capitol Hill.
Beleaguered House Republicans held a closed-door meeting on the Hill Wednesday for what turned out to be a mundane gathering that followed weeks of battles over how to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. The members, many who just seemed relieved that the fiscal cliff ordeal was, for now, finished, discussed amendments to a series of procedural rules for the 113th Congress.
"It was kinda dull," said Georgia Rep. Phil Gingrey as he left the    meeting after it was over. (Some members, who just seemed bored and tired by the  process, had left early.)
For more than two hours, caucus members discussed 32 proposals that hardly a soul outside of Washington will ever hear about, or would likely care to hear about.
One discussion addressed the current House rule that bars lawmakers' children older than the age of 12 from joining their parent on the House floor. The proposal would allow "all children of Members of the House of Representatives,

‘Fiscal cliff’ deal leaves everyone bruised, but some more so than othersBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! NewsPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Jan 2, 2013Tweet0
The bill to avoid the "fiscal cliff" is finally passed and signed by President Barack Obama, and the culmination of intense negotiations between Republicans and Democrats seems to have left nearly everyone unhappy—or, at most, begrudgingly grateful that some kind of deal was reached.
Unlike elections, the legislative process doesn't always offer a clear winner and loser, and the battle over how to avoid nearly $600 billion in painful spending cuts and tax increases was no exception. But some escaped with fewer cuts and bruises than others. Here are the "winners" and "losers"—terms we use loosely.
'Winners' 
President Barack Obama: The president took a beating from his own party two years ago when he cut a deal with Republicans that temporarily extended income tax rates for all income earners set by former President George W. Bush. This time, Obama refused to budge on one of his main campaign promises to increase taxes on wealthy taxpayers. As part of this deal, the income tax rate for

Obama and Boehner holding firm on tax increases, but some in Congress call for compromiseBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! NewsPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Dec 6, 2012Tweet0
WASHINGTON—While President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner negotiate a deal to avoid a series of automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to begin next year, both camps continue to publicly tangle over whether to increase taxes on the wealthy.
But within Boehner's caucus, there is a small group of Republicans who say they are open to raising tax rates, but only for a price.
"We should have everything on the table, and we should discuss it," said Michael Mahaffey, a spokesman for Florida Republican Rep. Tom Rooney. Rooney has expressed a willingness to let taxes go up in return for a massive restructuring of the way the federal government pays for Social Security and Medicare. "If we can get a big deal that includes real entitlement reform, then we should consider ways to balance that with more revenue," Mahaffey continued.
For Rooney, the specific language outlining the entitlement overhaul would need to be written into the bill and not just promised as a future goal.

House Democrats continue to tag Republicans as ‘hostage takers’By Chris Moody, Yahoo! NewsPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Dec 5, 2012Tweet0
Screen shot from GOPHostageTakers.com
House Democrats on Wednesday launched a new microsite, GOPHostageTakers.com, criticizing Republican leaders for not holding a vote to exclusively extend middle-income tax rates for another year as part of avoiding the so-called fiscal cliff.
Current tax rates for all income levels are set to automatically increase in 2013 unless Congress takes action this year. Most Republicans want to extend the current rates for all income levels, while Democrats want taxes to increase for households earning more than $250,000 annually.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee launched the site as part of a larger messaging effort to goad Republicans into voting on  a bill that excludes those earning more than $250,000 from the rate  extension.
This week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, submitted a "discharge petition" that would force a vote on a bill to extend rates only for middle-class taxpayers, but only if she can persuade 218 members of the Republican-led

After election, Crossroads GPS runs ad on ‘fiscal cliff’By Chris Moody, Yahoo! NewsPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Dec 5, 2012Tweet0

Crossroads GPS, the issue advocacy group and sister organization to the Karl Rove-backed super PAC American Crossroads, will spend $500,000 on a new television ad urging action on the so-called fiscal cliff.
The ad, which criticizes President Barack Obama for calling for higher taxes, is an early example of how such groups will carve a niche in policy debates in off-election years. Crossroads GPS spent heavily on issue ads during the 2012 presidential election and is not required to disclose its donors.
The 30-second spot will run for one week on national cable stations starting on Thursday and during network political talk shows this Sunday.
Marco Rubio dishes on his decision-making process for a presidential runBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! NewsPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Dec 5, 2012Tweet0

WASHINGTON—Marco Rubio won't say the word "president," but the Florida Republican senator is making it no secret that he's keeping options open for a White House run in 2016.
Speaking at a breakfast here on Wednesday, Rubio discussed the decision-making process he's going through to seek the presidency, or as he vaguely calls it, to serve "in some other opportunity."
"I enjoy public  service. I think what I as a person—everyone needs to decide—as I  approach 2016, is do I want to continue to do that in the Senate, is there some other opportunity out there for me or do I want to return to  the private sector and give someone else a shot? And there are a lot of  factors that go into that decision," Rubio said during a video interview with Politico's Mike Allen. "Part of it is whether you feel a  calling to it, whether you feel the fire to do it. Not just because  people tell you you should do something. Part of it is whether your  family life can sustain it. ... All of these things are

Ryan and Rubio outline visions for the GOP’s future—and they’re both part of itBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! NewsPolitical ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Chris Moody, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Tue, Dec 4, 2012Tweet0
Marco Rubio speaks during Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad's annual birthday fundraiser, Saturday, Nov. 17, 2012, in Altoona, Iowa. (AP/Charlie Neibergall)WASHINGTON—It is unfashionable to admit to harboring lustful thoughts about the 2016 presidential race so soon after the November election, but it is naive to think it wasn't on the minds of the conservatives who came to hear Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Paul Ryan speak at the Jack Kemp Foundation Awards Dinner on Tuesday.
The two lawmakers, both under the age of 43, represent the youthful and enterprising wing of the Republican Party and seem more than willing to lead the GOP into a new generation. The foundation—which is named after Jack Kemp, a New York Republican who died in 2009—honored Rubio with its leadership award. Kemp was a personal mentor to Ryan, who was the first to receive the award last year.
Rubio, of course, is already well-known in Republican circles, having risen to national prominence in 2010 after he upset Florida Gov. Charlie Crist to win his Senate seat. He was considered among conservatives to be a top pick to become Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's

Blog Posts by Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsOne stabbed, another sexually assaulted in Nordstrom Rack robberyBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Fri, Jan 11, 2013Tweet0
Two burglars took 14 people hostage overnight at a Nordstrom Rack store in Los Angeles, stabbing one hostage in the neck and sexually assaulting another.
LAPD spokesman Christopher No said police were notified at 11 p.m. that the robbery was taking place.
At about 3:30 a.m. a SWAT team freed the hostages, according to the L.A. Times, but the suspects had somehow escaped the premises.
The hostage who was stabbed has been treated and released, No said. Police are now investigating a white SUV in Culver City, which they believe may have been the getaway vehicle, and are still looking for the two suspects.
Gun control debate: Is an assault weapons ban out of reach?By Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Fri, Jan 11, 2013Tweet0

Vice President Joe Biden announced Thursday that he will recommend new gun control measures to President Barack Obama, which include more comprehensive background checks on gun buyers and limits on the sizes of ammunition magazines. The proposal could lead to the most significant move on guns in 20 years, but one regulation highly coveted by gun control advocates was notably missing: a ban on assault weapons.
In 1994, President Bill Clinton managed to push through a sweeping ban on certain kinds of semi-automatic weapons, dealing a crushing blow to the National Rifle Association and other gun lobbyists and sparking a political backlash that helped Republicans reclaim the House and Senate for the first time in 50 years.
That ban, which expired 10 years later in 2004, is still seen as the gold standard by many gun control advocates, who have been fighting in vain to get it reinstated—with some modifications—for years. Since the horrific Dec. 14 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 first graders dead and sparked a national conversation about the nation's gun violence problem, many advocates think they see their chance.
"It is time to pass an enforceable and effective assault weapons ban," New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the leading gun control advocate in the nation, said in a press conference after the shooting. Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill quickly introduced legislation to ban the weapons in late December.
But Biden's omission of the ban from his description of his package of proposals on Thursday suggests an assault weapons ban is out of reach. (It's still possible that the ban could be included in Biden's final proposal, which will be announced Tuesday, and both Biden and Obama have voiced support for the ban on other occasions in the past few weeks.) A lot has changed since 1994—including public opinion,the legal landscape and the political might of the NRA.
"I don't think a ban on assault weapons—which is a ban on some of the most popular rifles in America—is likely to get support," said Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and Second Amendment expert. "The 1994 ban was widely recognized to be ineffective and to be riddled with loopholes."

Teachers flock to gun courses as gun-violence debate heats upBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Wed, Jan 9, 2013Tweet0

Free gun courses aimed at teachers and school administrators in Utah, Texas, North Carolina and Ohio have attracted hundreds of applicants in the wake of the shootings at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.
The classes provide gun training and a concealed carry license for those who qualify. Gerard Valentino, a co-founder of the Buckeye Firearms advocacy group in Ohio, said more than 900 teachers and administrators have signed up to take the three-day class his organization is offering at the Tactical Defense Institute in West Union, Ohio. Local news reports out of Utah, Texas and North Carolina suggest that hundreds more teachers are undergoing gun training in those states as well.
Meanwhile, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, has sent armed volunteers to patrol areas around about 50 schools this week, and a city council in a small town in Utah is considering passing a resolution that encourages all teachers to carry concealed weapons to schools.
The vast majority of teachers are not allowed to bring weapons to school, training or no training. It's unclear how many school districts allow teachers to carry weapons, but at least one district in Texas and all the districts in Utah do so. A handful of states, including Ohio, do not expressly prohibit guns on school campuses, in theory leaving it up to local governments and school districts to decide. But it doesn't appear that any district in Ohio does allow guns in schools. State lawmakers in Tennessee and other states are weighing legislation to change this, however, and to open up schools to armed teachers.

A ferry taking commuters from Highlands, N.J., into Lower Manhattan slammed into a pier Wednesday morning, injuring nearly 60 people on board, police say.
NY1 reports that multiple emergency responders are at the scene evaluating people's injuries after the ferry's hard landing. A few commuters were seen being wheeled away on stretchers into ambulances, while others are being treated at the scene. At least one commuter is in critical condition with a head injury, according to authorities. ABC News reports that the man is currently in surgery.

2012 was warmest year on record for United StatesBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Jan 8, 2013Tweet0

A scorching spring helped make last year the warmest on record in the contiguous United States, according to scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
Spring of 2012 (March-May) was the hottest ever recorded, while the winter months were the fourth warmest ever. The average temperature for the year was 55.3 degrees Fahrenheit, one full degree warmer than the previous record hot year of 1998. The heat wave was felt all over: More than 450 cities in 46 states experienced their hottest year ever, with Des Moines, Iowa experiencing the biggest jump in temperature.
Scientists told the AP that the huge temperature increase is a combination of natural weather events like La Nina and climate change from greenhouse emissions. "A picture is emerging of a world with more extreme heat," Andrew Dessler, a Texas A&M University climate scientist told the AP. "Not every year will be hot, but when heat waves do occur, the heat will be more extreme. People need to begin to prepare for that future."

Sheriff: Alabama bomb plot student may have been influenced by NewtownBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Tue, Jan 8, 2013Tweet0
Derek Shrout pleaded not guilty in an Eastern Alabama courthouse. (AP)A 17-year-old Alabama high school student accused of plotting to blow up his classmates may have been influenced by the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., in December.
Authorities say Derek Shrout, who was released on $75,000 bail Monday and has pleaded not guilty, wrote down plans for building a bomb in a journal found by one of his teachers at Russell County High School in Seale, Ala. The teacher then handed the journal over to police.
Shrout's parents allowed police to search their home after they were told of the journal. They found empty tobacco cans with holes drilled in them that were filled with pellets, which Russell County Sheriff Heath Taylor characterized as the beginning stages of a bomb.
Taylor said he believes Shrout may have been influenced by the Newtown shooting because his first journal entry about the bomb was made on Dec. 17, just three days after that attack.
Shrout's attorney, Jeremy Armstrong declined to comment on the charges Tuesday morning, but he told local

Feds spend more on immigration enforcement than other crime agenciesBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Mon, Jan 7, 2013Tweet0
Spending on immigration enforcement. (Migration Policy Institute)
The federal government spent $18 billion last year on immigration enforcement, more than the combined spending of the rest of the federal government's law enforcement agencies over the same period.
The $18 billion immigration price tag is larger than spending on the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Secret Service, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives combined, according to the new report from the Migration Policy Institute think tank.
Spending on immigration enforcement, which includes everything from screening visitors to the United States to deportations, has increased 15-fold since 1986, when President Ronald Reagan signed a bill into law that legalized 3 million immigrants and for the first time required employers to verify their employees' immigration status. Though the law attempted to stop illegal immigration from the southern border, the waves of migration continued, peaking in 2000 at 1.7 million border apprehensions. Since 2005,

Storm-ravaged Staten Islanders angry over stalled Sandy aidBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Lookout – Fri, Jan 4, 2013Tweet0

Congress isn't exactly winning popularity contests anywhere in America, but in New York's storm-ravaged borough of Staten Island, its name is mud.
Republican House Speaker John Boehner declined to bring a $60.4 billion aid package for people hit by Superstorm Sandy to a vote on Tuesday night, sparking a backlash from both Republican and Democratic politicians from New York and New Jersey, who called the delay callous and a "betrayal." Boehner quickly announced that on Friday, Congress will vote on one urgent portion of the bill, which sends more than $9 billion to the government's flood insurance program. That program was expected to run out of money early next week as the victims of Sandy have been filing claims in droves.
But the rest of the $51 billion in aid won't be voted on until Jan 15, more than two months after the storm hit, and a longer wait period than survivors of past catastrophes like Hurricanes Ike, Katrina, Gustav, Andrew and others have faced.
In the meantime, some in Staten Island say they're tired of feeling like the government doesn't care.
"What do I think? I think they're lucky we're not armed," yelled Rose Mazz, 68, out of the window of the small storm-damaged home where she's lived for 24 years.
A few minutes later, Mazz emerged from the front door--stamped with a green inspection sticker from the city that labels it inhabitable--in a puffy coat and apologized for not inviting me in. "You wouldn't be able to breathe in there," she explained, gesturing inside to a cloud of dust emanating from the construction. Her home was under four feet of water, and she's still repairing her roof, boiler, furnace and plumbing system at an estimated price tag of $100,000.
"They're so busy spiting each other and playing games," she said of Congress. "It's sad."

New York tabloid skewers Boehner, Congress over stalled Sandy aidBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Thu, Jan 3, 2013Tweet0
New York Daily NewsTell us how you really feel, New York.
The New York Daily News led with a dramatic "Stabbed in the back" cover and story Thursday morning, displaying the anger over a stalled $60 billion in federal aid that the House of Representatives declined to bring to a vote Tuesday night.
On Wednesday, Rep. Peter King, a Republican from Long Island, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and other politicians blasted House Speaker John Boehner for failing to vote on the package, calling the move a betrayal that leaves hundreds of thousands of homeowners in the lurch.
Boehner announced later on Wednesday that the House will vote on a $9 billion emergency extension of the government's flood insurance fund, which is set to run out next week, on Friday. But the remaining $51 billion in the aid package will wait until Jan. 15.

Backlash follows House delay on Sandy relief voteBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! NewsNational Affairs ReporterPostsEmailRSSBy Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News | The Ticket – Wed, Jan 2, 2013Tweet0

After a late-night decision from House Republicans to delay a vote to provide billions of dollars in relief to states hardest hit by Superstorm Sandy, House Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday attempted to tamp down a backlash, telling colleagues he would bring up one part of the aid package to a vote at the end of the week. New Jersey and New York Republicans said Wednesday afternoon that Boehner promised them he will vote on a $10 billion extension for the government's flood insurance fund—set to run out next week—on Friday.
The speaker said he will bring the other $51 billion in aid to a vote January 15.
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, blasted Boehner earlier on Wednesday for not putting the bill up to a vote. Christie warned Boehner and the Republican House majority that they would feel the wrath of outspoken New Jersey and New York politicians.
New York "Gov. [Andrew] Cuomo and I are not wallflowers. We are not shrinking violets," Christie said. He called the delay in aid "callous" and an act of putting politics over what's best for the victims of a major storm trying to rebuild.
"All I can tell you is that this was the speaker's decision. His alone," Christie said, adding that Boehner did not take several of his calls Tuesday night.
Some Republicans have expressed reservations about money in the aid package that did not go directly to relief efforts and questioned why the bill needed to be passed quickly when Congress was also dealing with the "fiscal cliff" and other issues. It seemed on Tuesday that Congressmen from the Northeast and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had hammered out a deal to split the aid bill up into two parts, but then Boehner unexpectedly declined to bring it up for a vote.
"It's a Boehner betrayal," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, Democrat from New York.
But Republicans from the Northeast were also mad. On the House floor, Rep. Peter King, a Republican from storm-ravaged Long Island, N.Y., blasted the delay as "indefensible" and said Congress had a "moral obligation" to hold the vote. On Wednesday, he urged New Yorkers to withhold all donations to congressional Republicans in an appearance on Fox News, apparently so hopping mad about the delay that he doesn't mind turning on his own party.

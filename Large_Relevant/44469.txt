Nobody asked for ur opinion either, nigga. U have no right to impose ur deviant fagginess on the rest of us.
Expecting straight guys 2 be cool with showering with a fag is comparable 2 expecting a bunch of women 2 be cool with a straight guy insisting on a right to shower with them: how dare they be uncomfortable at having a person in their shower that was perving at them & wanted 2 fuck them? Yea, that'd go down well...
If you cant grasp that you're an idiot.

Love it - one of the most passionate versions on that tour - sometimes he just appears to be going thru the motions when performing this song, like it's a contractual requirement - but damn, here he's feeling it!!  Nothing beats this song when he's playing it with true passion!...
Captured beautifully (if only there was a soundboard audio to put on it)...

Amen, he's a legend.
Wish he had the same staright out musical passion now as he had back in the pre-JW/slave days - those 1st15 years were phenomenal. Better than anything anybody's doing now, or then.
As good as anybody, anytime!

She's been around for ages dude, she's released about a dozen albums.
Do yourself a favour and track down Beth Hart Live In Paradiso 2005 dvd (lots of clips on youtube). Unrestrained and on fire. 
This clip doesn't even hint at how outstanding she is live. She's done numerous more passionate versions of this very song. Let youtube be your friend

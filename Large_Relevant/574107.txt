THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU (2011) - Thomas Newman - Soundtrack Score Suite

Order: Reorder
Duration: 15:00
Updated: 30 Jan 2013


If you've seen the trailer for The Adjustment Bureau, you'd be forgiven for thinking that it was some sort of relentless chase , not unlike Paycheck, perhaps, though hopefully less abysmal. An adaptation of a Philip K Dick short story, it also appeared to contain all the usual trappings you might associate with the writer's work: alternate layers of reality, an unfathomable conspiracy, and a lone protagonist who struggles to lift the curtain on the whole insane cabal. On one level, this is precisely what The Adjustment Bureau is. It does, indeed, contain a male protagonist battling against a seldom seen, powerful organisation. But not, perhaps, in the way that its trailer, or its association with Philip K Dick, might suggest. The Adjustment Bureau is more like Dick's work filtered through Michael Powell's A Matter Of Life Or Death, or maybe Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life. If you're at a dinner party and want to sound incredibly erudite and witty, you could even say it's less Franz Kafka and more Frank Capra. That's sure to raise a chortle over the After Eights. If nothing else, it's a reminder of just how varied the films inspired by Philip Dick's work can be. Blade Runner was a Metropolis-style fever dream of the future, Total Recall was an ultra-violent gun fantasy, while The Adjustment Bureau is a fantasy romance with an added dash of Phildickean bureaucracy and red tape. Matt Damon stars as down-to-earth senator, David Norris, whose head is turned by pretty ...

1-8-2012 Utrecht - geldwisseltruc bij winkels (herhaling)

Order: Reorder
Duration: 1:44
Updated: 01 Jan 1970


Op vrijdag 12 augustus 2011 en donderdag 2 februari 2012 gebruikte een vrouw een geldwisseltruc bij de kassa van een aantal winkels. Ze verwisselt snel een biljet en zegt daarna dat de cassiere zich vergist heeft. Bij haar poging op 2 februari heeft de cassiere haar door en mislukt de truc.

De politie denkt dat de vrouw deze truc vaak uitvoert, omdat ze er erg handig in is. Het zou kunnen dat meer winkeliers de truc herkennen.

Er zijn bewakingsbeelden van de vrouw. Als u haar herkent, bel dan met politie Utrecht via 0900-8844 of Meld Misdaad Anoniem op 0800-7000.

THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU (2011) - Thomas Newman - Soundtrack Score Suite


				
					If you've seen the trailer for The Adjustment Bureau, you'd be forgiven for thinking that it was some sort of relentless chase , not unlike Paycheck, perhaps, though hopefully less abysmal. An adaptation of a Philip K Dick short story, it also appeared to contain all the usual trappings you might associate with the writer's work: alternate layers of reality, an unfathomable conspiracy, and a lone protagonist who struggles to lift the curtain on the whole insane cabal. On one level, this is precisely what The Adjustment Bureau is. It does, indeed, contain a male protagonist battling against a seldom seen, powerful organisation. But not, perhaps, in the way that its trailer, or its association with Philip K Dick, might suggest. The Adjustment Bureau is more like Dick's work filtered through Michael Powell's A Matter Of Life Or Death, or maybe Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life. If you're at a dinner party and want to sound incredibly erudite and witty, you could even say it's less Franz Kafka and more Frank Capra. That's sure to raise a chortle over the After Eights. If nothing else, it's a reminder of just how varied the films inspired by Philip Dick's work can be. Blade Runner was a Metropolis-style fever dream of the future, Total Recall was an ultra-violent gun fantasy, while The Adjustment Bureau is a fantasy romance with an added dash of Phildickean bureaucracy and red tape. Matt Damon stars as down-to-earth senator, David Norris, whose head is turned by pretty ...

To mitigate invasive quagga and zebra mussels' impacts to water and hydropower infrastructure, the Bureau of Reclamation has found that silicone foul release coatings may be an important tool. Allen D. Skaja, Ph.D., PCS, of Reclamation's Technical Service Center tested more than 50 coatings and metal alloys over three years at Parker Dam on the Colorado River. http://www.usbr.gov/mussels/

					Op vrijdag 12 augustus 2011 en donderdag 2 februari 2012 gebruikte een vrouw een geldwisseltruc bij de kassa van een aantal winkels. Ze verwisselt snel een biljet en zegt daarna dat de cassiere zich vergist heeft. Bij haar poging op 2 februari heeft de cassiere haar door en mislukt de truc.

De politie denkt dat de vrouw deze truc vaak uitvoert, omdat ze er erg handig in is. Het zou kunnen dat meer winkeliers de truc herkennen.

Er zijn bewakingsbeelden van de vrouw. Als u haar herkent, bel dan met politie Utrecht via 0900-8844 of Meld Misdaad Anoniem op 0800-7000.

Richard E. Roeper (born October 17, 1959)[1] is an American columnist and film critic for The Chicago Sun-Times and now a co-host on The Roe Conn Show on WLS-AM.[2] He co-hosted the television series At the Movies with Roger Ebert from 2000–2008, as the late Gene Siskel's replacement.

Personal Life[link]
Roeper was born in Chicago, Illinois, and was raised in south suburban Dolton, Illinois. He attended Thornridge High School and graduated from Illinois State University in 1982. He has described himself as a Catholic, although "not always first in line for Sunday Mass".[citation needed]
Career[link]
Roeper began working as a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times in 1987. The topics of his columns range from politics to media to entertainment. In more recent years, he has been widely considered one of the finest newspaper writers in Chicago, just a notch below the city's golden-inked "Mount Rushmore" of John Kass (Tribune), Dave Hoekstra (Sun-Times), Jay Mariotti (Sun-Times) and Roger Ebert (Sun-Times).
He has also written seven books, on topics from movies to urban legends to conspiracy theories to the Chicago White Sox. In 2009 Roeper appeared on Howard Stern's show and said he had written a book on gambling, entitled Bet the House,[3] which was released in the first quarter of 2010.
Roeper also was a radio host on WLS AM 890 in Chicago. He also hosted shows on WLUP-FM, WLS-FM and WMVP-AM in Chicago. He won three Emmy awards for his news commentaries on Fox in the 1990s, and was the film critic for CBS in Chicago for three years in the early 2000s. He won the National Headliner Award as the top newspaper columnist in the country in 1992, and has been voted best columnist in Illinois by the Associated Press on numerous occasions.
His columns have been syndicated by the New York Times to publications around the world. Roeper has written for a number of magazines, including Esquire, Spy, TV Guide, Playboy, Maxim and Entertainment Weekly. He was once named as one of People magazine's most eligible bachelors.[citation needed]
Roeper has been a frequent guest on the Tonight Show, Live with Regis and Kelly, The O'Reilly Factor and countless other national programs. He is currently the host of Starz Inside, a monthly documentary series airing on the Starz network since the fall of 2007. Roeper appeared on the first episode of the fifth season of Entourage reviewing the fake movie Medellin starring fictional movie star Vincent Chase. In April 2008, Roeper was the central figure on an episode of Top Chef, in which the contestants served up movie themed dishes to Roeper and his friends, including Aisha Tyler.
In February 2009, Roeper launched his own web site, [1], which features movie reviews, blog entries about politics, sports and movies, photos and Twitter entries. For most of the year Roeper was posting print reviews and blog entries. In December 2009, he launched a video section, with on-camera reviews of movies. The video segments are produced in partnership with the Starz premium cable channel. Roeper announced the reviews will appear first on his site, then on the Starz channel.[citation needed]
In December 2009, it was reported[by whom?] that Roeper had signed a "six-figure" deal with ReelzChannel to be a regular contributor. He will continue to review movies online for his website and for Starz.
As of Monday, April 12, 2010, he is now the co-host of The Roe Conn Show on Chicago's WLS-AM 890 radio station from 2-6pm CST.
Work as a film critic[link]
After Gene Siskel of Siskel & Ebert died on Saturday, February 20, 1999, Roger Ebert did the show with nearly 30 co-hosts. After 10 guest stints, Roeper was offered the opportunity to permanently co-host the popular film review show with Ebert. The series was renamed Ebert & Roeper at the Movies in 2000, and shortened to Ebert & Roeper in 2002.
Beginning in August 2006, while his co-host Roger Ebert was recovering from cancer surgery, Roeper was joined by guest critics, including Clerks director Kevin Smith and The Tonight Show host Jay Leno. On Sunday, July 20, 2008, Roeper announced he was leaving the show in mid-August and would return with a new show later in the year.[4] He continues to write his general interest column, and also contributes reviews to the Sun-Times and to newspapers across the country.

Early life[link]
Born in Los Angeles, California, he was the youngest son of Mississippi-born Martha Louise (née Montgomery) and composer Alfred Newman. He is a member of a film-scoring dynasty in Hollywood that includes his father, brother David Newman, sister Maria Newman, uncles Lionel Newman and Emil Newman, cousin Randy Newman (who is also known as a singer and songwriter) and his nephew Joey Newman. Newman was educated at Yale University before starting his career in music.
Film scoring career[link]
His first major score was for the 1984 film Reckless. In 1999, Newman composed the score to Sam Mendes' first feature film American Beauty, created using mainly percussion instruments. Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the "moral ambiguity" of the script, saying "It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve that." This was his first collaboration with Mendes, and he would go on to score all of the director's subsequent films except for Away We Go. He received a fourth Oscar nomination for this score, and although he lost again (to John Corigliano for The Red Violin), he did receive a Grammy and a BAFTA.
His critical and commercial success has continued in recent years with his scores for films such as The Green Mile, Erin Brockovich, In the Bedroom, and The Salton Sea. He was nominated consecutively for a further three Academy Awards, for Road to Perdition (2002), Finding Nemo (2003), and Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). However, he lost on each occasion, to Elliot Goldenthal (for Frida), Howard Shore (for The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King), and Jan A. P. Kaczmarek (for Finding Neverland) respectively.
He was again nominated for an Oscar for scoring Steven Soderbergh's The Good German (2006). At the Oscar ceremony, he appeared in the opening segment by Errol Morris, who jokingly stated that Newman had been nominated for and failed to win an Oscar eight times. Newman replied: "No, I've failed seven but this will be my eighth", and indeed, he again lost, this time to Gustavo Santaolalla for Babel.
His first score since The Good German was for the 2008 animated film WALL-E, collaborating for the second time with director Andrew Stanton (with the first collaboration being Finding Nemo). The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature (as had "Nemo"). Newman received two Oscar nominations: one for Best Original Score, and another for Best Original Song for "Down to Earth", which he co-wrote with Peter Gabriel. He was nominated in the Original Score category with two other veteran composers, James Newton-Howard and Danny Elfman, both of whom have also been nominated for several Oscars but each time unsuccessfully. Newman lost both the score and song nominations to A R Rahman for his work on Slumdog Millionaire. He and Peter Gabriel did however win a Grammy for "Down to Earth".
In 2008 Newman scored Towelhead and Sam Mendes' Revolutionary Road and in 2009 he scored Brothers. Newman's scores of 2011 include The Help, The Debt, and The Adjustment Bureau.
Newman is to score the 23rd James Bond movie Skyfall, directed by his long time collaborator Sam Mendes, which celebrates the film franchise's 50th anniversary.[2]

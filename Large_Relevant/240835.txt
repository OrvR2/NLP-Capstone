Luke 13:2-5
Jesus said: “Do you think those Galileans were worse sinners than all the other people from Galilee? Jesus asked. Is that why they suffered? Not at all! & you will perish too, unless you repent of your sins & turn to God & what about the eighteen people﻿ who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them? Were they the worst sinners in Jerusalem? No, & I tell you again that unless you repent, you will perish, too”

Luke 13:6-9
Jesus said: “A man planted a fig tree in his garden & came again & again to see if there was any fruit on it, but he was always disappointed. Finally, he said to his gardener,﻿ I’ve waited three years & there hasn’t been a single fig! Cut it down. It’s just taking up space in the garden. The gardener answered, Sir, give it one more chance. Leave it another year & I’ll give it special attention & plenty of fertilizer. If we get figs next year, fine. If not, then you can cut it down”

This happened 9﻿ years ago in Argentina (December, 2004). Almost 200 people killed due to fireworks in a night club called Cromañon.

Absolutely futile; It was all over long before they ever took a sledgehammer to the first block. Look at the video for The Station Nightclub fire. From the point of ignition, the first deaths occurred in about two minutes. Within 6 minutes, anybody who wasn't outside was dead from smoke inhalation or burns. Most frightening video I've ever seen. It happens﻿ with amazing speed....

They were breaking the wall to release some of the smoke, because the fire fighters couldn't see a thing inside and couldn't breath well,﻿ even with gas masks

They aren't firemen. It's Brazil... when there is trouble, everyone jumps in to help the firemen. They are people who live around the area. The building only has one exit (THE FRONT DOOR) --- unfortunately because of the massive amount of dead bodies and fixtures hanging down,﻿ it is hard to get out of the front door. Therefore, they are just knocking down the wall to provide an alternative escape route for those trapped inside (Just like Yuritower77 said.)

when will people learn that setting off fireworks indoors is a bad idea? the 2 other major nightclub fires(in US+RU) that also killed 100+ people each were also caused by fireworks....﻿ is anyone seeing a pattern here? i mean it even has the name FIRE in it, FIRE-WORKS..... who would let it off in a nightclub full of people? you might as well throw a grenade in there

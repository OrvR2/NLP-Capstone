Lilly says generic competition hurts fourth-quarter profit, salesReuters – Tue, Jan 29, 2013

(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co  said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter profit fell as competition from generic drugs, particularly for its once top-selling schizophrenia drug Zyprexa, drove revenue lower.
              The U.S. drugmaker earned $827 million, or 74 cents per share, down from $858 million, or 77 cents per share, a year earlier.
              Excluding special items such as asset impairments and restructuring, Lilly earned 85 cents per share, beating analysts' expectations by 7 cents per share.
              The better-than-expected results were due to cost controls as well as strong sales of key drugs, such as lung cancer treatment Alimta and antidepressant Cymbalta, Lilly spokesman Ed Sagabiel said.
              Revenue dropped by about 1 percent to $5.96 billion, but were above Wall Street expectations of $5.81 billion.
              Zyprexa, now facing generic competition, saw sales slide 49 percent to $385 million from $750 million a year earlier. The company said the sharp drop was partly offset by gains in sales of other drugs and its animal health products.
              Lilly forecast earning would increase this year by 13 percent to 17 percent to $3.82 to $3.97 per share, excluding special items, due to cost controls.
              Profit will benefit by 7 cents per share due to a research and development tax credit that was delayed until this year due to the late signing of federal legislation.
              On January 4 the company forecast earnings of $3.75 to $3.90 per share, but that did not include the tax benefit.
              It predicted sales will be flat to a bit higher this year, in a range of $22.6 billion to $23.4 billion, despite expected generic competition in December for its $5-billion-a-year Cymbalta.
              Lilly has been battered over the past year by generic forms of Zyprexa. Besides the looming threat from Cymbalta generics, it is girding for copycat forms of its $1 billion-a-year Evista osteoporosis drug that are due to arrive in early 2014.
              Cymbalta had sales of $1.42 billion in the fourth quarter, up 20 percent from a year earlier, and a total of $4.99 billion in 2012.
              The company hopes to cushion the blow from generics with approvals of some of its 13 experimental drugs now in late-stage trials.

Of course they do, you can't charge $200 for a $.50 pill.

Please tell me what research and development this "generic" company is doing to come up with these often life-saving drugs to begin with.  Oh yeah, that's right - they aren't.  The pharmaceutical companies are the ones that invest billions for R&D and to bring drugs to the market.  Even then, only one in about a dozen make it past testing.  The cost of a drug that makes it has to make up losses on the huge number that don't.  You might not like it, but there would be virtually NO drugs being developed without the pharmas.  So instead of criticizing, how about get down on your knees to thank them for your pain medication, blood pressure medication, heart medication, depression medication, birth control, etc...

It's been going downhill ever since doctors stopped making house calls.

So let me get this right... it's about profits and not about healing sick people? That's awesome!

Consumers need to learn that only they can make themselves healthy - not drugs, doctors, etc.  Only you - exercise, eat & sleep right and watch majic happen.  Do something different and pay the piper.

"They include some of the world’s best-selling drugs, like the rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drugs Humira and Enbrel"  But not the cure!!!  Pharmaceutical companies are not about curing people but about making a (ridiculous) profit and the illness more tolerable.

Monopolies on medication would hurt competition and are illegal. Can't believe they said that. This is why we need regulations, folks.

Excuse me for piping in ut has anyone read the Constitution recently?  Are you aware that US patent laws provide for "exclusivity" of the benefit of the research and development of any products?  You need to read aArticle 2, sec 8 paragraph 8 to see how the US patent system works.  These products are "patent" protected.  Thats the way it is.
Furthermore, your doctor is NOT a charity, the hospital is NOT a charity, and its the physician who orders your treatment.  No, he doesn't have to order Zyprexa, there are alternatives to that molecule.  When is the general public going to let up on the pharmaceuticals they use and realize that the single most costly expense in health care is the hospital, plain and simple.  Any drug that keeps you out of the hospital is the cheapest drug of all.  How do I know?  I have practiced pharmacy going on 50 years and no one in that time period has ever said "gee, that was cheap" at any cost.  No one wants to be sick, no one wants to go to the Dr. and no one is happy at the pharmacy counter.  Please, get over it, get smart, and realize that you got the best there is, at any cost.
How much is it worth to a psychotic patient to be able to function in real time?  Sorry but the football (drugs in general) has been kicked around far too long and their benefits hidden in the cloud of negative badboyism.

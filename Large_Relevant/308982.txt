Mother Warns of ‘N-Bomb’ Synthetic Drug After Daughter’s Wild SymptomsSt. Louis Area Officials ConcernedBy William BrowningPostsWebsiteBy William Browning | Yahoo! Contributor Network – Tue, Jan 15, 2013

A new threat faces law enforcement agencies battling drugs in Missouri. Its street names are known as "N-Bomb," "Smiles" and "251." The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reveals officials in Chesterfield, Mo., will discuss what to do with the LSD-like synthetic drug after a local mother's plea following the scary symptoms of her 15-year-old daughter.




* Carley Alves told Chesterfield City Council members Jan. 7 her daughter went to a party New Year's Eve in Wildwood, Mo. "At first, I thought she was drunk because she threw up at the party," Alves told the Post-Dispatch.




* The teenager's symptoms included seeing bright lights, an altered perception of sound and light, uncontrolled body movements in addition to difficulty breathing. The girl was never taken to the hospital. Alves believes someone at the party slipped the substance into her daughter's drink.




* The synthetic drug is derived from mescaline, which occurs naturally in peyote cactus. The technical name of the substance is phenethylamine.




* St. Louis County Police officials released a statement Jan. 8 following Alves' testimony. The press release calls the substance "very dangerous." Undercover narcotics officers in St. Louis County have purchased the substance from dealers.




* The name "N-Bomb" comes from the chemical name of the drug. The substance is referred to as 2C-I-NBOMe or 25INBOMe.




* Deaths from the combination drug have occurred in California, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota and Virginia. Thus far, just Virginia and Louisiana have banned the substance since November.




* The Post-Dispatch piece says the drug was invented in 2003 in Berlin, Germany. The substance isn't technically illegal because it is made from two banned parent drugs. Some federal prosecutors can charge sellers because the synthesis of the compound comes from substance already illegal for consumption in the United States.




* KMOV reported police investigated the teenager's incident within the confines of Missouri's so-called "Social Hosting Law ." The ordinance makes parents responsible for underage drinking and illegal drug use in the home even if the parent isn't at home during possible illegal activity.




* Alves told Patch.com she was "totally caught off guard" and was "shocked" by the possibility of a new synthetic drug. It's possible her daughter was unknowingly slipped the drug into her drink of Mountain Dew possibly mixed with Everclear.




* Alves called drug officials who said her symptoms were more than just alcohol-related. The Patch article reveals a Drug Enforcement Agency official returned the mother's telephone call to say the new drug is similar to acid. The teenager has since fully recovered, although her mother is worried about long-term effects of the drug such as possible kidney failure.




* The party mostly involved students at Marquette High School, according to Patch.com. The school is located in Chesterfield, a suburb of St. Louis along the Missouri River.




* Synthetic drugs made headlines across Missouri in mid-November when federal indictments were handed down to three people in Springfield, Mo., for their alleged participation in a $6.7 million synthetic drug distribution operation. Substances like "N-Bomb" are relatively new to Missouri which is why Alves is trying to educate parents about the drug.

Is this a story or a collection of notes that will be used to actually write the story?

She may have actually been slipped mushroom, peyote or mescaline--the stomach symptoms are the most telling--and the cross-sensory flip and residual  and flashback retro strange perceptions, for awhile...it should not be attempted by anyone without a spiritual guide experienced shaman --and in a decidedly different venue...!

much the same would happen if guns were made illegal. Necessity is the mother of invention. i could imagine that we would be seeing more air powered shooting deaths with radioactive bullets pulled from smoke detectors.

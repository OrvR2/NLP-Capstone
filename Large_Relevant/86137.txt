While the White House and its media water-carriers try to distract the American public with gay-marriage talk and half-century-old tales of Mitt Romney's prep school pranks, the inconvenient truth remains: President Obama is responsible for perpetrating jaw-dropping, job-killing scientific fraud. And his minions are still trying to cover it up.
New internal e-mails disclosed by the House Natural Resources Committee this week show that a supposedly exculpatory report on the administration's doctored drilling moratorium analysis — issued by the Department of Interior's Inspector General's office — was itself incomplete, misleading and unsubstantiated. Even more damning, the documents reveal that the White House actively blocked investigators and refuses to comply with subpoenas.
Now, as one senior IG agent warned his bosses, "the chickens may be coming home to roost."
A quick refresher: After the BP oil spill in 2010, the White House imposed a radical six-month moratorium on America's entire deepwater drilling industry. The overbroad ban — inserted into a technical safety document in the middle of the night by Obama's green extremists — cost an estimated 19,000 jobs and $1.1 billion in lost wages.
The anti-drilling administration based its draconian order on recommendations from an expert oil spill panel. But that panel's own members (along with the federal judiciary) called out then-eco czar Carol Browner for misleading the public about the scientific evidence and "contributing to the perception that the government's findings were more exact than they actually were." Browner and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar oversaw the false rewriting of the drilling ban report to completely misrepresent the Obama-appointed panel's own overwhelming scientific objections to the job-killing edict.
Federal judge Martin Feldman in Louisiana blasted the Obama Interior Department for defying his May 2010 order to lift its fraudulent ban on offshore oil and gas drilling in the Gulf. He called out the administration's culture of contempt and "determined disregard" for the law.
Ever since, GOP watchdogs have attempted to hold administration officials accountable for the drilling ban fraud. In November 2010, the DOI Inspector General issued a report cited by Salazar to argue that any editing of the drilling ban report was unintentional and mistaken. But e-mails from IG senior agent Richard Larrabee released by the House Natural Resources Committee flatly contradict Salazar.
"I truly believe the editing WAS intentional — by an overzealous staffer at the White House. And, if asked, I, as the case agent, would be happy to state that opinion to anyone interested," Larrabee wrote.
He noted that the IG report failed to mention that investigators were unable to independently validate e-mails supplied by Salazar's office — and that the report was "simply silent" about how the White House blocked investigators' attempts to interview one of Browner's chief henchmen, Joe Aldy. "Well, it will be interesting to see if anyone picks up on these things, or cares about them," Larrabee wrote.
Well, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, R-Wash., cares. In a letter to the DOI Inspector General's office, Hastings blasted the stonewallers who have hid in the dark for more than a year. "The IG report is being used by the Obama Administration and others as a defense that this matter has already been investigated and resolved. These emails contradict that claim and raise new questions on whether the IG's investigation was as thorough and complete as it should have been," Hastings wrote.
The actual drafts of the drilling moratorium report and the communications between senior Interior Department officials and White House political appointees remain out of public view. "To date, the Interior Department has never had to disclose documents to the IG or to Congress," Hastings noted. "Despite the President's pledge of transparency, this Administration has not answered questions by anyone on how this decision was made that forced thousands of Americans out of work and cost millions of dollars in lost economic activity."
This election isn't just about jobs, jobs, jobs. It's about the lies, lies, lies that have led to massive job destruction — and the ruthless corruptocrats using our tax dollars to whitewash their radical green agenda.

1. New Poll: Romney 50%, Obama 43% after Obama comes out of closet.
2. Wisconsin Senate: Thompson (R) 50%, Baldwin (D) 38%
3. Obama's approval rating drops to new low of just 37%.

Obama has put $50,000 more on every persons credit card in the US in just 3.5 yrs spending 6.8 trillion dollars. Enough to have given every senior on SS a check for over 4 million or every legal taxpaying family in the US a check for close to $240,000 each. WHAT COULD YOUR FAMILY HAVE DONE WITH 240K??? WHERE DID ALL THAT MONEY GO? DID YOU GET YOUR "FAIR SHARE'???? INSTEAD OBAMA HAS DOUBLED THE NO. OF PEEPS GETTING SS DISABILITY CHECKS FROM 5.4 MILLION TO 10.8 MILLION IN JUST 3 YRS. AVG PER YR ADDED TO SS DISABILITY HAS BEEN ONLY 250K PER YR BEFORE OBAMA. How did 5.4 million peeps all of a sudden become disabled in just 3 yrs? Whistle blower says it is all done to reduce unemployment rate so Obama can get a 2nd term.

N.C. bans gay Marriage and over 260,000 dem's voted for no preference rather than vote for Obama, most all black church goers came out to vote against Obama along with Hispanics and it also is banned in Co. as it fails in their state leg. By this fall there will be 32 states with amendments to ban civil unions and gay marriage. Already 41 states ban same sex marriage. New polls nationwide are 60 to 40 against. Even Dem PPP poll in Ohio shows only 32 pct approve of Gay Marriage in that swing state.

Prisoner Beats Obama in Several West Virginia Counties: A man serving a seventeen-and-a-half-year sentence in federal prison won over 42 percent of the vote and at least fifteen counties and in the state's Democratic primary and delegates to the DNC convention in N.C. The Fifty-three-year-old Keith Russell Judd is in the Federal Correctional Institution in Texarkana, Texas, and did not even campaign yet came within a few thousand votes of beating Obama.

Another Obama-Funded Electric Car Catches Fire…Move over Chevy Volt, it’s Fisker’s turn. Last week, a fire badly damaged the home of a new Fisker 110k Karma owner, and authorities are saying that the electric car was the source of the blaze, according to Fort Bend County, Texas, chief fire investigator Robert Baker, the Fisker Karma started the fire that spread to the house. Plus Russia buys the bankrupt Chevy Volt Battery plant Obama gave millions to and another car Batt Co goes belly up in Mich that had no American workers or American equipment, it was all run and owned by Koreans with our tax dollars. Over 50 pct of Obama's 265 billion green jobs taxpayer dollars has gone overseas even building 500 million dollar new plants in Mexico with our tax dollars.

Janet Napitlanio's TSA hides millions in unused equipment in rented warehouses in Dallas when the GSA has thousands of empty warehouses and is building new ones and while Congress peeps visit they are trying to hide and destroy equipment by shoveling it out the back door. Plus TSA is buying more of same equipment that does not work that thousands of same scanners sit in the warehouses in Dallas. WHAT?

Even Dem.'s are now calling for Holder to be fired as 142 Dem's vote with Rep.s after he sends Congress thousands of blank pieces of paper.

To keep the interest rate from going up only means a difference of $7 a month and only applies to new loans. After we got the1 trillion in student loan debt transferred from the Big Banks books by Obama to the taxpayers books (credit card debt), don't you think they should be done away with entirely!!!. Just like black Judge Mathis on t/v said today all peeps should work and pay for their college. He worked at Mickey D's and payed for his college ed himself, no student loans. He says all kids would then not have time to get in trouble if they followed his example. Many, like myself and my 3 sons worked 40 hrs a week full time, provided for a family of up to 4, went to school at nite,

There are a lot of losers on this comment thread. Get out there and make some money you fucking bums! Instead of bitching about the top 1%, why don't you work HARD to be in the top 1%? Oh, because you're such a kind-hearted, compassionate soul who doesn't think money buys happiness. Fuck you! Work hard and earn a lot of﻿ money, then let's see if you share the same sentiments for the bottom earners. I owe everything I have to MY OWN hard work. Not to the generosity of others and the government.

That's why I love 50 Cent who said it plain and simple: Get rich or die trying. If you are broke you are literally a burden to yourself and others. Money is just a tool to enhance people's lives and make﻿ the world a better place.

Money talks no matter how ya cut it, and Cash is King. If you have money, or know how to get it, or know how to sell, then more power to ya. This speech is awesome and highly motivating to me personally. If I was in his industry I would want to learn everything I could from this guy because it's skills. And I think Affleck's quote rings true in Boiler Room when he﻿ says people who say money isn't the root of all evil don't have any.

Only one problem.... guys and gals, ya﻿ live and die by the dog eat dog strategy, then u too will have ur day. Ya cant have ur cake and eat it too, because , after awhile the shit u dish out will come back to your greedy fkg ass, and u too will be eating crap. So treat others how u expect to be treated, its the Golden rule, and the one with the most gold wins. play your cards right, not just how u expected them to be dealt.

It's people like this who got us into this shit economy by pushing mortgages onto idiots who cannot afford them.
Fact: a good family life can bring you much more happiness than money ever could. Look it up, it's been proven by science. And what do people make money for? To be happy.
Unless you think money is more important than happiness,﻿ then good luck chasing after the number.
btw that watch is $599 on Amazon, he got ripped off.

To me personally, everything in life at some level boils down to the sales process. Sometimes people say they don't like selling or don't want to sell. And I just think like it or not you are selling yourself all the time. I'll be honest I have only seen this clip from the movie, but how it speaks to me personally is: stop being a wuss and go make money, go take care of business. If you have﻿ a product you can believe in and of high value, all the better

I like this message. He sounds like my basic training RDC's. You may not like the truth that your not doing well but it's the truth. No sugar coating anything in this speech. As my Chief used to say: Don't look at how the message is delivered just read it! I got chewed out and given IT because I didn't iron my t-shirt right. Does that make﻿ my RDC an asshole? Back then it was a t-shirt later on that could be a bolt that I screwed on too loose and the aircraft could crash and kill people!...

If the salesmen in this video get some skills, better themselves and rise to the occasion or Baldwin's challenge, and if they reach his level, he will totally respect them for it. Why?﻿ Because successful people respect and look up to other successful people. Rich people learn and grow, Poor people "think they already know".

But he doesn't need your respect. I would be sure someone like that﻿ would be well respected irl by his associates and higher ups because of what that person is capable of and achieved. He gets shit done-and is rewarded appropriately.

Because you'd likely be a bum otherwise. It all matters on how far you take it I guess. You may not want to exhibit it so outwardly as him, but its really an attitude that you want to have - not to show to others, but﻿ for yourself to get things done.
Its no ones job to take care of you. Know what I mean?

I agree with your last sentence. However it's a matter of choice. Not everybody wants to make money, some would rather work less and spend more time with their familly, even if it means win less money.
And this guy takes his job way too﻿ seriously. I mean, why should one care so much about one's shitty job? In comparison to a loving wife, a happy familly, sharing beers with friends, this is nothing.

That's fine if you don't want as﻿ much as others, but that means you don't get what they do. You don't get all the luxuries of hard work if you don't work hard. This country is so messed up.

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. Regardless, you﻿ gotta get out there, take action and make something happen, and this requires serious people and business skills. Great speech.

The correct answer is , "I am a closer. Now when I go and close tonight then you'll understand. When I close every night you'll understand." The point of the speech is not to make you feel like shit or to feel like you have an asshole boss, the point is to make you realize that if you can't do your job you don't belong there. So either go do it, or leave.﻿

I'd throw my leads in his face,﻿ and say "Fine. Here's the deal. You make $15 grand in two hours with this, I'll walk out now. Otherwise, you lose. You can suck my fucking dick for the rest of your life if you're even one penny short. I'm sorry your mother still cuts your hair with a bowl and you think you're awesome but you are nothing but a massive pile of shit". Then I'd walk out and slash the tires of his $80,000 BMW.

There is a big flaw in this "sheep/Master" metaphor. A sheep is forced by his Master to be skinned and give milk. It doesn't go to college in order to apply for being skinned and milked. An employee, however, is making a voluntary decision to trade his salesmanship to his boss for money. And the guys in the movie apparently can't keep up their end of the bargain. (No, haven't seen it. Don't give a crap﻿ about the movie's "real message." I'm talking about the context given within this video only.)

I read the Cracked article. I understand it was written with noble intentions, No, your life won't get better just by sitting around feeling sorry for﻿ yourself. Yes, it's important to offer something of value to the world. But not like this. Assholes are assholes and abuse is abuse. There has to be another way. There has to be a middle ground. This is shit. This is poison.

"Don't be a pussy," What a compelling argument. Especially when that "tenacity" you're talking about involves selling shit people don't need and may not be able to afford so you too can wave your expensive watch in people's faces﻿ to prove how big your dick is.

I've been writing Youtube comments for 15 years! A guy don't come on Youtube lest he wants to like comments. They are sitting out there in front of their computers waiting to give you their likes, are you gonna take them? Are you man enough to take them?

Yeah, this is a good kick in the ass for those that need it, but being a watch, or a 970k salary doesn't make you a complete human. That just makes you a weak superficial douche bag. That article was done with good intentions and may have inspired some neck beards or hipster 20-somethings to get of their ass and do something but if your ship leaves port in﻿ the wrong direction it's bound to get lost at sea.

The thing is it can be applied to all facets of life - which I think may be the point. Think of anything you've tried to achieve or aspire to. It's the attitude you want to have, not towards﻿ others, but for yourself.

i agree with both you and Glen Ross here. When you are with friends, family, or the general public it is best to treat them with the utmost﻿ kindness and respect. However when you are at work or working towards a goal it is best to keep a sharp focus that does not waver. if you relent on pursuing something even for a second it can be lost or taken from you. that is the message that Glen Ross was trying to deliver. He did it in a crass manner to get the others attention.

The message here is simple. I am your master, work for me. If you don't work for me, you're worthless garbage, and I will dispose of you as such.
And we portray this raw image of at the﻿ least egocentric sociopathy, and at the worst the philosophy of tyranny, as motivational. We see virtue in this unenlightened piece of shit because he can throw on a fancy suit, get in a fancy car, and belittle his lessers without consequence. And we think that's something to aspire to. Fucking disgraceful.

completely missed the point of this speech, congratulations. the message is the﻿ world only cares about what you can give it, and if you can give it nothing of value, you have nothing of value to the world, and you will be passed up for someone who does. don't like it? tough shit, that's the way it is and feeling sorry for yourself won't change a damn thing. it's not about wealth, it's about dealing with the facts of society and being smart and motivated enough to make it in society.

Nice try, you complacent mule. I know what an﻿ idiot like you thinks this video means, but I don't get my wisdom from the know-nothings at cracked. This is a video of a lord and master, and our reaction to his behavior is what tells us whether we are men or sheep. You are a sheep. And while you are useful to your master for work, you are useful to humanity for nothing.

Its easy to talk big shit hiding behind a monitor but I'm going﻿ to guess that you're not a CEO of a company and you are in your own terms a "sheep" of your "Master" where ever it is that you work.( assuming you do). This scene shows what you need to do in order to get to his level of success and if you don't like it you can fuck off. Parading around the youtube comments section with a sense of " Everyone is an idiot and I'm better" attitude is sad. I'm sure you'll hit me with " You're sheep too"

You accept the system you're subjected to, show absolutely no desire to make any efforts to alter it or even condemn aspects of it, and you defend the unjustifiable authority of your superiors while belittling and condescending to those who aspire to something better.
Yes, you are a sheep.
I'm no genius, but nor am I some condescending stagnant twat wasting away in mindless complacency shackled by my pathetic and cowardly defeatist attitude towards﻿ society and my place within it, as you are

It must be nice to live in a world where everyone who disagrees with you can be written off as a sheep without considering their opinion. So what do you have against this depiction specifically? The fact that a company wants their employees to do their jobs? ﻿ The fact that society allows companies to exist? The fact that the companies exist at all?

I see that, and I would even agree to it. But thats﻿ not what I see here. It's a business that's collapsing no matter what, the employees already don't want the company to fail any more than their superiors, as they don't want to lose their jobs. This is just a desperate asshole who thinks if he stirs up enough fear, maybe his workers can do magic and fix his fuck ups.
At which point you can devote yourself to the asshole and fall with him, or say fuck him and get a head start on something new.

This speech is right up there with Gordon Gekko "Greed is good" speech as a great example of what's wrong with people who define themselves by how many shiny things they have and who they can dominate, humiliate and destroy in the name of their own shallow pursuit﻿ of first place in the great rat race. Yeah mate, you're a winner, but still a rat running a race of other people's choosing.

Glad you've seen the film. Seems like most here haven't. How are they losers? They're desperate and on hard times, but it's corporate machinations that push them to their ultimate failure. The speech, inserted into the film from the play, is an example of how they're being pushed to fail. I don't quite understand how it's the point that it was "lost" on them; do they﻿ not do everything they can to follow the advice, to close?

Technically speaking, this is﻿ motivation, though motivation doesn't guarantee success. I don't see how liking this speech makes one sociopathic, though. Isn't this the exact same way soldiers are motivated to train in the army? Is that sociopathy then? Personally, I like this speech because it kicks oyu in the ass to do something. No minced-words, no soft-talking, just cold, hard, truth.

Yes. Yes it does make them sociopaths. Why does it seem like this is based in anti-intellectualism, a protest against effete, word-mincing academics who don't see the "hard truth?" This isn't a condemnation of you,﻿ just a general gripe with the Cracked article that was the first positive portrayal of Alec Baldwin in the movie I've seen and the blog it links to.

See that's where you're wrong. The men in the﻿ film fail, yes. But do you think real life gives a shit? People get their asses kicked by life every fucking day. Some whine about it and say poor me. They get fucking nowhere. Some rise above and succeed anyway. Why? They're winners and they think like winners.

The men in the movie turned out to be right - they're doing poor sales because the market sucks, and he gives them some shitty leads and makes them watch him fellate himself about how great﻿ he is. In the end of the movie the high-paid consultant hasn't helped the company, he's caused an entire office to implode.

Again who gives a fuck? In sales if you﻿ don't sell you won't last long. Should the company continue to use salesmen that produce nothing? That's a fantastic way to run a company, into the ground. Not saying the guy isn't a douche, but he's right. About sales and life.

Touting a﻿ watch that costs more than a car doesn't impress me. Such a watch isn't significantly better in telling the time than my Casio. Wearing a watch like this is basically like walking around with a table that says "Look At Me, I'm So Rich!"

He's using his success wrongly. It's not enough for him that he has good skills and can use them, earning a lot of money. He﻿ needs to constantly project it to the world, he needs to buy pointless prestige items that scream: "Look at me, I'm rich, I'm better than you!" That's not impressive, that's pathetic.

Interesting how people don't see how this scene applies to pretty much anything important in their lives. This isn't﻿ some bootstraps speech. Baldwin's telling them they have the tools, the advantages, and the privileges to do what he's doing, but they're comfortable wasting other people's resources and complaining that it's not enough.
Simply being a "nice guy" isn't going to save your marriage, nor make you a better guitarist. Being "nice" is the bare mimimum of social expectations.

More likely scenario is the losers will cry bitch and moan about corporations, better men, while they starve to death - a much slower execution. Performance based living baby! Get used to it. There's no room for hippies and bitter hipsters who want to work less hours, be "free" while enjoying all the spoils of the modern world.

Better how? Many of them end in bitter divorce. In fact, ever taking any sociology or psychology courses? A lot of the studies show that the rich are also some of the most unhappy people. Often cause they backstabbed people or they neglected friendships or relationships to make money and thus have no one to really﻿ trust or relate to.
hell go look up "Suicide Rates Higher For Americans Living Among Wealthy Neighbors: Study" since youtube won't let me link.

I﻿ guess then you don't have to go as far as executing them. As a business owner with ambition and motivation to take good care of my family and become the 1%, I find offense to your post. Watch your word. Each to their own, nature takes care of everything.

And yet studies show that executives of big businesses are 4 times more likely to be clinical sociopaths. But they are still great people eh?
And if you become part of the 1% like the 1% currently where most of them are﻿ takers and let greed sway them? To the point where you buy politicians to push bills that fuck over the majority for your own gain? Then I'll call for your execution as well.

Lower level consumers are just as much of "takers". That's human nature my friend. When labourers want more wage through unions, when people call for less profit for the corporations, they are playing the﻿ exact same game. "I want more for less." is the human mantra, therefore capitalism is the most natural system for us. The poor idiots have the mass on their side - there's more unsuccessful people than successful people. We're all just trying to make more than the other people no matter what.

Explain to me why the top 400 companies pay near or at 0% in taxes when they've been making record profits for years now since the recession? Explain to me why the rich get constant bonuses even when their poor practices drive them into bankruptcy (see hostess, no, it was NOT the Union Workers that killed﻿ it, it was hedge funds and many other factors). Explain to me how there are people in the top 1% who pay 0% in taxes. Explain to me why the top 1% can take 93% of the new income and pay less?

Because fuckers like you just cluster the comments section of my favorite video of﻿ all time instead of joining the toiling masses and trying to do something of value. You use the perceived inequality as an excuse to do nothing at all. The belief that any effort would be in vain as you could not possibly reach the top or achieve anyway is more comfortable and allows you not to change anything in your life. I observed the frustrated occupy mov. from an office - made me happy that I worked hard.

I don't care about money. I don't waste it needlessly and I'm fairly smart with my investments so I don't actually have money problems, but I don't consider it to be the end all be all of life like retards like you.
Seriously, why do you ignore these facts?
Btw, I'm at work now, I'm on my break. I work quite hard and probably harder than your lazy lying ass.

When did I mention money? You're missing the point.
Fox? I'm not American.
You write: "You REALLY think a lot of the top 1% think "what can I do to make a difference" and not "what should they do for me?""
Often these﻿ two are the same. "Making a difference" is catering to a demand. Our society works because we found an effective system to facilitate the advertisement and fulfillment of demands. If you can fulfil you will be rewarded in order to afford to have your own demands fulfilled.

You are sadly mistaken. You are talking about what the system is meant to be, not what it is.
The system started out like that, but powerful people have been twisting the rules to make it harder for others to reach their level.
Lobby groups have too much power in﻿ America, and other countries as well.

You are right. That is why I used the word 'often'. Barriers to entry make it harder for anyone to fulfill demands. That creates a lag in the societal value chain and inefficiencies similar to those in a monopoly - a slightly less efficient outcome and a skew in the distribution of wealth results.﻿ However, no matter how fair a system is, there will always be slackers and performers will always be rare and set themselves far apart.

You're a winner. Work hard, smart, with positivity. Take ownership and think "What can I do to make a difference today?" rather than "what should they do for me today?" ﻿ Similar to Kennedy speech, I know, a bit cliche but it's true.

You REALLY think a lot of the top 1% think "what can I do to make a difference" and not "what should they do for me?" Please. Why do you think things are so﻿ fucked up when they are the ones buying off and controlling and actually ARE the politicians themselves? They are looking out only for themselves and looking at what they can get from others. It's why they want to get rid of Social Security. Even though it doesn't add one iota to the deficit. But they want that money.

Because superiority is real. The 1% is not an accident. I constantly see end-level labourers, retail workers, fast food chain hands that﻿ are not even worth the minimum wage they get paid. Life is meant to be unequal. Without a small portion being successful while the masses are mediocre, success means nothing. Besides, the large corporations make things much more affordable through mass production and big oil, so the lifestyle of the poorest Westerners are far better now than it was 60 years ago

So tell me this, the top 1% takes a huge amount of money from the people, uses that to claim they had profits that year, and they are really smart businessmen and﻿ hard workers? Bullshit. There are definitely many who are hard workers and got there with hard work, but a great deal many more got there through cheating, lying, conning, and rigging things in their favor.
And just cause corporations make things doesn't mean they should be getting subsidies from us and such low taxes in actuality.

Amazing. I'm reading your mini-manifestos of hate for the whole of humanity, and am trying to understand how you've warped the concept of "human decency" to defend anything you've said.
I think your biggest contribution to progressing as a culture is packing so much misdirected anger into two short paragraphs that if they collapse on themselves it'd create a black hole of cognitive﻿ dissonance that even your defensiveness could not escape.

I suspect people most offended by Baldwin's "pep talk" are people who hate everyone else.
People act like being "nice" is an accomplishment. That not appearing disgusted with the whole of humanity 24/7 expends all their available energy. That if they do the bare minimum to interact with others in society it's a remarkable accomplishment.
If it's﻿ really that hard, you're a misanthrope
Baldwin's speech isn't about how these guys are living their life, it's about how they're doing their job.

If you can be happy without belittling other people or conforming to society's standards, you're a real success﻿ story. I don't care what watch you have or what car you drive, and anybody with a half a brain feels the same way.

It should be obvious that when I say 'real success story' I do not mean﻿ 'success' when defined by traditional standards. I mean they would be successful in my opinion, where success is your ability to be happy with your life. If YOU care what watch you have and you need a nice one to be happy, fine. But people should not judge 'success' by such petty standards, in my opinion. But success is measured differently by different people.

The unfortunate consequence of using this particular big business strategy too often is that it isn't only psychologically detrimental to the ones you put through this kind of stress, it's also detrimental﻿ to your own mental health.

Well if you know the movie, these people use underhanded tactics to make money.
In other words, big business, where they buy off politicians to benefit themselves and not the consumer (such as self﻿ regulation, see listeria lettuce).
So, shut up and do some research you furry faggot.

Well it does actually.
Trust me. When I have a nice home, a decent﻿ car and I don't have to worry about any bills or expenses. I feel pretty damn successful. Because no money problems = less stress less stress = more happiness, and more happiness = a good life. And I didn't get to this level of stability with the ability to enjoy the things I like by being successful at anything other than making money.

I agree that money helps.
I disagree that it is an accurate measure for succes.﻿ That's only to overmaterialistic minds ho would istake poverty to be the polar opposite of succes.
According to that logic a rich-born loser, of a trophy wife is more succesfull than Stephen Hawking.
Or many succesfull bussiness owner a complete faillure in comparison to Bill Gates -or even Brad Pitt, and Schwarzenegger-
There simply is more than money to measure succes.

Exept it's proven that money =/= less stress.
If you have enough, of course the worry over how to pay the bills and still get enough food for your family drops away, but new problems arise. Most rich people have very high stress levels for some reason. I can't really explain how that works and I don't have time to search for a study or something, so if you﻿ care/have time just google it.

prolly cos to be someone who goes out and makes money you need some strong motivation, some people really fear being poor, or﻿ fear social stigma for being a "loser", fear can be a pretty strong motivator, so those kind of folks i reckon would tend to make lots of money, correlation over causation but yes

Some see money as a means to an end, and stop working themselves to death once their needs are covered. Others see it as a status symbol, and that need is infinite, so they need more and more. And these people often aren't happy because they spend their money only to prove they have money (like buying expensive cars) instead of spending﻿ it on what they actually care about.

PandorasProxy people with high incomes tend to lead more stressful lives because as their net worth grows, so does their quality of life. Therefore in order to maintain their expensive lifestyle, they must continue working high-stress jobs to pay for it. My﻿ father is an ambassador and he is constantly worrying about money. Even though he gets paid a lot, our lifestyle is very expensive and he must work long hours to support it (schools, drivers, maids, food, HOUSIN, etc.).

They tend to,﻿ but that depends on your job doesn't it, not your income. If you make loads of money but you have high stress then that's your fault for picking a job you hate.
David Attenborough makes loads of money and he works really hard, but would you say he leads a stressful life? I doubt it.

I can assure you David Attenborough has his fare share of stress, we just don't perceive it. Remember..not everything you see on TV is the way it actually is. And income for the most part is largely dependent on your job. You can like what you do and still find it very stressful, case and point my father. He enjoys diplomacy, but it comes with high levels of stress. The same applies for any professional career.﻿ Think of Doctors, they enjoy their profession, but the stress is terrible.

You don't have to guess when it's on my profile, mister Netherlands.
It isn't oversimplification, and Stephen hawking is far from poor, he makes a huge, HUGE income from his books and television appearances. And not because he's a nice guy, or a good father, but because the man works his ass off. My point is that you aren't successful because﻿ you have money, but you will have money because you are successful.
So for example, Kim Kardasian is not successful, even though she has lots of money.

I﻿ love this speech. The main reason is because you can gauge yourself with how you respond. The way I would respond is "This guy is an asshole. I'm gonna do better than he ever has in business just so I can throw it back in his face" Which ironically is exactly what he wants. Others would say he is mean and others would laugh at him and say they are better than him in other ways.

No the fact that he could probably hire a team of lawyers and make this dudes life even shittier than it it. He demands respect because he know's what he earned and has.

Being hard isn't enough. Movies and TV tell you it's enough so﻿ you think you have a chance. The secret is to be smart. You can be hard all you want, but an idiot will be revealed very very quickly, and the world smack you for being so arrogant and throw you in the gutter. At that point, all the "hardness" will be good for is bitching about how you got screwed over. Be smart, period.

It means he's not speaking from the heart, he's giving a scripted and rehearsed speech. "GET MAD YOU SONS OF BITCHES, GET MAD!" It's like a Drill Instructor﻿ yelling at the new recruits. Nobody thinks the DI is abusing the recruits, but people in the private sector who don't get what Fuck You is doing will take it personally.

So basically, he's not literally trying to abuse them. He's just trying to motivate them to do better. And what better way to do so then proving how this apparently jerkass, snobby, pretentious﻿ guy is wrong about them.

When I first got into sales, my manager played this for our training class. Fact is, either you "get it"'or you don't. Sales can't be taught. You can know everything there is to know﻿ about a product or concept, but if you aren't a natural, you'll never make any money.

Oh, it happens, even today. Sales managers all across the country IDOLIZE this scene. They'll even show it to help "motivate" people. Some people in sales connect well with the prospects and make sales better than others. The problem is that lots of sales organizations think they can "train" people to think﻿ slick like a Ricky Roma. Ricky Roma's just "are".

the problem is how much do you need to shower when you get home? I've done all sorts of sales, and I'll trade lower commissions for walk ins, rather then cold calls, but that's just my﻿ style now.

You did the miles, were willing and did a lot of cold calls and now you work better leads and the difference is you probably will make good sales percentages on your walk ins. Most people are not willing or have﻿ the confront it takes to do it and you did... but you are a real sales person which is different then order taking. I agree with you 100% if you can work a smarter system then going in cold great but you got there by being willing to cold call in the first place.

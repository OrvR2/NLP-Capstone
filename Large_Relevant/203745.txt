If the democrats were trying to find common ground will be one thing, their not. How bout you link examples of Obama trying to work with the republicans pls. Your against tax breaks during war, hows your stance on tax increases﻿ on small businesses during a triple dip recession, those small business owners probably gross over $250k ? How you feel about putting MAJOR costs onto same small businesses with Obamacare? Minimum of $2k per employee, hows that going to help the economy

I actually never supported the war on Iraq & certainly not without a way to pay for it nor did I support the conservative genius 2 give tax breaks during a time of war. Realistically I don't really value the opinion of conservatives these days on most issues, especially not on the economy or﻿ gov't, they've lost their credibility completely in my book. I applaud the Democrats for trying so hard to work w/ & find common ground with a bunch of incompetent & extremist conservative right wingers.

Yup wars cost money, I'd certainly rather spend it on expanding access to healthcare for our citizens. I'll put your 75 yr projections aside for the moment because its honestly a waste of my time to address but lets talk about these "liabilities". You call medicare and social security welfare liabilities? Perhaps you don't understand that both programs are funded by taxpayers and workers. I also supported the﻿ stimulus and the regulations that came with saving our banks & market from crashing.

Oh, you mean those wars the democrats overwhelmingly voted for? Trying the old selective memory huh? Wars will cost $4 trillion by 2020 (a lot yep) Unfunded Obamacare liabilities (over the next 75 years) are estimated to be $17 trillion, a staggering $99 trillion (over 75 yrs) for underfunded US welfare liabilities: Medicare, Medicaid and social security.... so works out to appx $1.5 trillion a year. As for fiscal﻿ irresponsibility, did you look at Obama's stim spending? ..ooo please go there

My small business is certainly hiring as well as upgrading our facilities thanks to President Obama's steady hand handling our economic recovery. Shit I've turned down 4 jobs just in the last 6 months and I've been promoted the same﻿ number of times just this year. Frankly President Obama has helped our small business and small businesses in our area substantially number one by working hard to bring our economy out of recession and producing month after month of growth. I'll be hiring all year.

Nobody said President Obama ended the war early, but end it he did and start it he did not.﻿ He certainly didn't propose starting 2 wars without accounting for how he/we would pay for them, but he did inherit the debt of this republican fiscal irresponsibility. The President like us, the American people got left with the bill from the Republicans who not only didn't pay for their wars they reduced our ability to do so and drove our economy into the ditch with their fiscal irresponsibility.

From what I read,﻿ he offered $400 billion a year, his increase would generate $200 billion.... deficit was $1 trillion last year....spending problem not revenue... as for the wars, Obama didn't end Iraq early, he keep to the planned Bush withdrawal (within 2 weeks), expanded Afghanistan and widened the drone strikes. Small business is not hiring due to uncertainty after costs government is now saddling them with, primarily the cost of Obamacare

The President and Democrats offered to cut spending enough and waste where it can be done effectively and responsibly in a manner that benefits the people and programs. Also a large part of our debt and deficit is paying for the wars republicans introduced without providing any way but a magic invisible hand to pay for it.
How by cutting taxes, especially on the rich. Republicans told us this would create jobs, expand the economy. It﻿ caused economic recession, contraction, instability & debt.

He wants to raise taxes but is unwilling﻿ to cut spending enough. It's not a revenue problem, it's a spending problem

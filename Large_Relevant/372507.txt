4daysagoRussia Bolshoi Ballet acid victim: I forgive my attackerBy Steve Gutterman, ReutersYuri Kadobnov / AFP - Getty Images, fileAn April 2011 photo shows Sergei Filin, artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, as he looked before an attacker threw acid in his face in Moscow on Friday. MOSCOW -- The artistic director of Russia's Bolshoi Ballet says he has forgiven the attacker who splashed acid in his face and has pledged to return to the stage.His head shaven and a bandage around his neck, Sergei Filin told a Russian television station from his hospital room that he was determined to return to work despite his injuries.Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economyFilin, 42, suffered severe burns during the attack on his way home from the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow late on Jan. 18. Doctors have performed two operations on each eye and hope to save his sight.

"I am not going to lie. Of course it is very hard for me and very difficult," Filin said in grainy footage in a video-link with NTV television late on Sunday."I tell myself every morning when I wake up: 'Sergei, you are healthy, everything is in its place -- your arms, your legs.' ... And I will do everything to go back to being the same Sergei I was before."Filin did not wear the thick bandages that had swathed his head and face in mobile phone footage taken the day after the attack, but his eyes were half-closed and it was unclear whether he could see.Filin's job gave him the power to make or break careers at the ballet, which is an enduring symbol of Russian culture. He said after the attack that he had been receiving threats."A priest came to me, and I told him: 'You know, I forgive everyone, and God will be their judge. Because people are weak,'" he said. "I forgive all the people who are involved in this."He said he did not know who was behind the attack but made clear he believed that it was related to his work."Before somehow satisfying their ambitions or quenching the pain of resentment ... it would be truly good if they would just think about the fact that I have three remarkable sons," Filin said."Even if the worst happens, I will continue to look upon this world, and I will continue to do what I do -- but it will be through the eyes of my three sons."Russia's top eye doctor told Reuters last week that Filin would retain at least some vision in each eye."I promise, you will see me on stage," Filin said.Copyright 2013 Thomson Reuters.

Watching-404403What an awful and vicious thing for someone to do. No matter what the situation you don't solve your problems with violence. I hope they catch the person(s) who did this to Filin. I don't know anything about the laws in Russia, but hope the culprit is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
I admire Filin's spirit and wish him the best for a full recovery, including his eyesight.

There was no attempt at an execution/contract style killing by a sniper or with a handgun so probably not a mob related affair. No explosives or bombs so probably not terrorist related. Attacker was disguised (probably because they were known by the victim and would have been recognized) and used a method that causes disfigurement and suffering but not death (so probably an act of revenge by someone known to the victim who feels he hurt them in some way). The attacker should be searched for among the people in contact with and known to the victim by looking for a history of prior arrest, depression, substance abuse, psychiatric care, etc.. Every effort should be made to apprehend and prosecute the attacker as he/she may feel free to attack others in the future. Here is hoping Mr. Filin a speedy recovery and return to his profession. The Bolshoi is the premier ballet in the world with a long illustrious history including performance of the first rendition of Swan Lake.3 votes#1.2 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 5:41 PM ESTDaniel Scott Smithyeah i heard it seemed work or personal related because of the extremes the attacker went to "artistisicize" the type of attack, ie that it was attacking his public persona, image etc, and he is the rep of the ballet company. but he's a better and stronger man than i would probably be in that situation. very strong reaction. good for him.3 votes#1.3 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 7:59 PM ESTElizabeth-1372999Pandora, it is a logical conclusion, except that the perpetrator may not have been on any drugs or had any history of visiting psychologists: if they were dancers, they were working day and night, and if they had been on drugs they wouldn't have been able to dance at that level.  Even though he forgives, which may help him to heal (and I hope he heals quickly and well), I do hope that the perpetrator is caught and prevented from working or teaching ever again in the dance world.  I wonder if the other dancers are nervous about the people around them because of this.#1.4 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 8:37 PM ESTUDunnoBroAn act of ballet terrorism?

That would be two vicious acts.16 votes#2.6 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:23 PM ESTbigdogmom1What a nasty thing to have happen.  I'm sure Sergei means what he says about forgiving his attackers but I just don't know if it is just that easy.  If he can forgive I feel he well be a much happier person than if he let hatred and self pity eat him up.
I agree with some of the other posters here that our world is getting crazier and crazier.  What are we to do about it?  Perhaps Sergei's philosophy is the best, to forgive and move on.  But then again there is something to be said for justice, too.
I hope Sergei's eyesight improves and his scars turn into a badge of courage and he can once again dance, dance, dance.  Best of luck to him in the future and in forgiving his attackers.10 votes#2.7 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:38 PM ESTbigdogmom1Addendum - I hope he doesn't equate forgiveness with the need for a just punishment for his attackers.  They are two totally different things.  Forgive but don't let justice forget.  Again, good luck and a speedy recovery Sergei.1 vote#2.8 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:53 PM ESTLG-1820657I could never forgive something like that, I would be looking to get some acid and do the same back!

Terrorism is rampant in other countries and not so much in America. Anyway, it is a sad thing and I truly hope he recovers.1 vote#2.10 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:39 PM ESTRo MarGenerally, to forgive is healing to oneself.  Let's face it, the type of "person" who would throw acid does not care if you forgive them.  However, to continue to hate someone for doing you a wrong only poisons you by carrying it around.  Never forget, because you cannot afford to be their victim again, but for your own peace of mind it's often best to let go of hate.  It is not so much forgiveness, rather moving on with your own life.  After all, the best revenge is a life well-lived, not wasted on recrimination.2 votes#2.11 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 5:28 PM ESTcanada3dayerforgiveness isn't done for the attacker, it's for the victim.  as an attack victim myself (just a mugging, nothing this awful, thank God) once I forgave the man that attacked me I immediately felt better and was able to really move on.  I was lucky enough to be able to do this in court and say it directly to him. 1 vote#2.12 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 5:28 PM ESTElizabeth-1372999Forgiveness is not always possible; it's wonderful if he can do it. 
However, the reason justice must also be served is that the attacker could do it again to somebody else in charge, or if they have retired from dancing and if they are now teaching, they could harm children.  The attacker should not be allowed anywhere near the dance world.  Then, everybody could forgive the person, and at least know that there is no reason to dwell on the horror.#2.13 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 8:42 PM EST

Fantasizing what one want's to do, isn't the reality.
People were not made to harbor deep seated hatred, bitterness and anger perpetually. It has been  established doing so can cause medical conditions and lead to long term health problems, emotional and mental problems and affection relationship. No matter who one is. Therefore, being able to forgive and move on. literally leads to a much healthier and longer life in every areas.All things being equal.
I wish this courageous Director a rapid, full recovery.Especially for the sake of his children. I will keep in my prayers this gifted, passionate and remarkable man. Who can bring inspiration and joy to a huge number of people.I hope the one responsible for this vicious act is caught soon, held accountable and serves a long time.7 votes#5.2 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:32 PM ESTluckyboy-2090407Shining Example showing through him - that the Love Christ has For All Of Us....................11 votes#6 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:03 PM ESTFlorence ThomasMy sentiments exactly!!

Holding on to hate and the need for revenge may even hinder his recovery progress if that is how his energy is spent. I wish him well in his physical recovery. I think his emotional recovery is well on its way.9 votes#7 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:06 PM ESTIncorrigibleI believe if the attacker was trying to bring Filin down it backfired. The grace this man is showing in the face of such a hateful attack will shine so much brighter, will touch those around the world in ways he will probably never know, and will no doubt inspire most that read his response. I pray he is able to stick with this path and that hatred does not work its way into his heart. Sounds like he has found his positive to focus on in his sons. May they all work through the healing process and have all the support they need.7 votes#7.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:13 PM ESTJennifer, New YorkWhat a terrific man.

It is fine and dandy for victims and their family members to forgive these brutal attackers, murderers, rapists, and all variety of physical fiends and financial rip-off artists. It is the Christian thing to do. It might even be wise to do so when the wrong doer has not yet been apprehended; otherwise, some might decide to come back and finish what they started. However, the State must remain separate from the Church to fulfill its compact with citizens to protect the public and maintain civility by imposing harsh consequences for such wickedness.2 votes#13 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 2:40 PM ESTJanine-984304I don't understand why you had to add that comment about the 'state must remain separate from the Church to fulfill its compact with citizens...".  First of all, I don't see how the imposition of sentencing has anything to do with forgiveness or the church.  Forgiving a person doesn't absolve them from responsibility.  They should still be held accountable.  Second, churches and religion often uphold just punishment for heinous crimes.  In fact, our whole country's laws are based on Judeo-Christian principles.  Finally, to clarify a point many people do not understand, there is no such thing as "separation of church and state" in any of our country's founding documents.  That is a misinterpretation of our First Amendment based on what Jefferson said in a letter to the Danbury Baptists in 1802.  Our founders (or at least most of them) never planned on an absolute separation of church and state, as our modern Supreme Court has been upholding at the request of some groups like the ACLU--although Jefferson did mention such a wall between the two in the letter several years later. While Jefferson was more intent on creating such a wall, other founders (like Madison, etc.) did not. I think the actual text is quite clear and doesn't need interpretation:  "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." 
(FYI...An August 15, 1789 entry in Madison’s papers indicates he intended for the establishment clause to prevent the government imposition of religious beliefs on individuals. The entry says: “Mr. Madison said he apprehended the meaning of the words to be, that Congress should not establish a religion, and enforce the legal observation of it by law, nor compel men to worship God in any manner contrary to their conscience....")3 votes#13.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:23 PM ESTDeb-2466128The Bible says that to forgive and pray good to your enemy is as if heaping coals of fire upon their head.  Also, God says "Vengence is mine and I will repay."3 votes#13.2 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:24 PM ESTalton reyesAnd as a matter of fact, God knows how to get them back better than anyone else could ever know.5 votes#13.3 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 3:37 PM ESTfnkheehaw@Alton reyes.
Couldn't of been said any better. Let go and let God!!1 vote#13.4 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:22 PM ESTWatching-404403fnkleehaw, the correct expression is "couldn't HAVE been said any better."
Sorry, it had to be done.#13.5 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:50 PM ESTElizabeth-1372999I think what is meant is that forgiveness is helpful to the victim and their family, and will help in a greater understanding.
However, the state must pursue justice, because the attacker is still a menace to others: anybody who would do this to one person could do this again to others.  Would you want such a retired dancer to then teach your children?  Anybody who retired this year, or anybody who did not get a solo they wanted, is suspect, and all of the other dancers deserve to have their names cleared.  This isn't a simple "separation of church and state," but an understanding of the need to keep all of society safe from an attacker.#13.6 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 8:54 PM EST

I tell you one thing, I would have no problem doing the same to the attacker...let him or her feel what it was like.  If anyone did anything to harm anyone in my family I would blow their brains out.  That's the problem...no criminal has any fear because they know the person they are attacking can't defend themself.

Forgiveness isn't about helping the attacker live with what they did. It's about letting go of the hate and anger in your own heart, so you can live a happy life, not dragged down by the weight of the stones tied around your heart.

Forgiveness is just that, a way certain people have of going on, clearing ther negative from their lives, not letting it eat them up from the inside out.  Sergei will probably have the scars from this attack for the rest of his life and they will remind him every day of the attack (thus he didn't add "forget" to "forgive").  While Sergei may be a kind and gentle man who will find it in his heart to forgive he may still insist upon justice if the attackers are ever found.  I know I would.3 votes#23.1 - Mon Jan 28, 2013 4:06 PM EST

Obviously he is not a mechanic. Calling the grease something nasty? Really? I have never seen a office guy doing some work on a gear drive. No wonder why he is so touchy. lol

That old lady is my Hero!! But I think she should be more careful by not putting the gun down until the suspect is under control. Because she just let her guard down!!! What if that guy for real was intentions to kill someone? Or even worse, running away from a crime scene after committing a murder or something? She assumed the guy was safe just because he was wearing an uniform, wrong!! But I am happy she stopped that cop, yes yes yes!!!!

What I do not understand is how easy the District Attorney make up excuses for the state troopers gangster behavior and treat them like they are the victims in here!!!! Certainly we should have it clear that we have to be afraid to our bones of them all, really??? There is no way Leone deserved that abuse!! Not even a DOG in the street is treated like that!!!! They tried to kill him and still Leone is the offender??? All the injuries he got against a broken finger of a police officer??? Really??

Amazing, the police always say the same excuse for beating somebody, and that is all over the United States. It is obvious they get trained to do so and how to get away with it, but you know what? They will continue to do so because nobody cares and they know it.

So no matter what we do, there will come a time when a new world order or government will exist. A new system that will hunt down Christians once again. Times when those very few that remain true believers and have faith in God will have to place to run. The system will know everything we do( Google, Facebook, etc.), everywhere we go ( GPS, Bluetooth, Electronics, etc.), who we are, and where we come from. They ask for info, we give them to them, in their hands little by little. Antichrist????

I was not a big fan of Pink Floyd back in the day, liked it a bit, but this song by
Vedder,﻿ oh my god what a great song!!! Love it, Eddie puts his entire heart into it -you can see it in his face and hear it in his voice -amazing. I was embarrassed by Waters behavior, what in the f... was he doing? Is he always like that?

It is one of only three songs on the﻿ album for which writing credits are shared between Roger Waters and David Gilmour. The melody and most of the music was written by Gilmour while Waters contributed the lyrics and some additional notes.

This, without Eddie, would remain a mediocre "classic rock" tune constrained within those barriers of not taking anything, not a darn thing, beyond what﻿ it has been for 30 or whatever years. Eddie brings some sparks, intensity. And what's with Roger and the weird pantomime?

Eddie Vedder did a really great job here!!! I adore David Gilmour -- if he wouldn't come to the﻿ show -- I'm glad Eddie Vedder did!!! There is a fabulous video from Roger Water's The Wall shot in London -- the light shines to the top of the Wall on David Gilmour! There was a rumor that he would turn up at one show!!!!

It should be embarrassing for Roger to be mouthing the words over Eddie and beating his chest and emoting to the fans in the audience during a part of the song that is now too high for him to sing. It's like, dude, Roger, we get it, you wrote songs for Pink Floyd, but hey, get over yourself, your singing over your guest on stage because you think no one is better than you. If I was Eddie I'd have﻿ been pissed, Such a huge ego on the old man.

This is one of the greatest songs of all time. I am bias because i think this IS the greatest Album of all time. I love this song it just makes me stop whatever I am doing and just listen over and over and over. It just mezmorizes me. The vocals, the guitar playing so fantastic. I love Van Morrison's cover a little better﻿ because the extend the vocals another verse.

What the fuck does this cunt know about New Yorkers. He hates America and he hates Americans. He only agreed to perform at this concert to promote his bullshit Wall tour. If I ever see him him in﻿ NYC, I'm gonna kick him in his balls.

He didn't play bass on this song﻿ during the WALL 1980/81 concert tour, because he played a role, that of "The Doctor" (who gives 'Pink', the main person, some injection). Andy Bown (Status Quo) played bass during those shows whenever Roger didn't. Roger never really thought of himself as a bassist, he was a guitarist before...

I﻿ adore Mr. Eddie Vedder! It is weird to hear him sing this song with his deep baritone voice, but he sounded great, as always. It's funny how the guitarist played all David Gilmour's notes exactly, yet they don't sound as good.

Now I will have to disagree with this. I respect Roger as an artist. He is amazing in so many ways. I have many of his albums. But to hear Vedder sing this, changes my opinion of this song. I may be biased being a 10 club member for a long time, but to me, sounds like Vedder was meant to sing this song.﻿ Almost as if Roger knew when he wrote this song, that someday, the Great Eddie Vedder will be singing this song. And turn it into a masterpiece.

I really﻿ like Pearl Jam. I love Pink Floyd. This.....was interesting. 7/10 for me. Eddie's fantastic, considering NO ONE has ever really had the balls to cover this song, especially on Gilmour's parts. It's just not done. Roger Waters has lost his spirit, though. I don't know if it's just me, but none of his recent stuff has been up to Floyd standards. Seems like it's all about a retirement fund rather than the music for him to me. Still a solid collab, though :).

I've been a fan of Pear Jam since 1991 and always had the the most respect for Eddie Vedder as a singer. This also shows you why Roger is a genius by, knowing Vedder is the only person capable of singing Gilmour's part of the﻿ song. This song is so amazing, and, It shows that this song can brainwash just about anybody. Just look at Eddie's face at :30. For a moment he got lost in the crowd's reaction and the song's trippy melody. Much respect for Eddie Vedder for finishing the show!

Kramer135. Well I was not much of a Pearl Jam fan. Go figure I live just outside of Seattle & was in my late 20's when they came out. I am﻿ a rock fanatic & this band did nothing for me. That being said I just love Eddie Vedders covers. He is just amazing in his covers. His Waiting with Tom Petty is better than Pettys original. His Last Kiss cover is better than the original. I can go on and on about his other covers. He even covers Devo's Whip It. But this cover is top shelf IMO. Thank you Guys

That was the high point of the whole show!! Eddie Vedder just going off﻿ on a song you know he used to jam to when he was a kid growing up in San Diego. Roger Waters is a musical genius and you add Eddie to that, and you've got magic. Got tingles up both of my arms when Eddie began to sing....and I'm 50 years old.

It was so awesome to see Roger﻿ Waters again after some years! I used to live on Pink Floyd music in high school during the '80's. They were dark times for me and their music seemed to reflect what I felt. I still love "Comfortably Numb" after all these years. On the old question of which one is Pink, it will always be Roger— as he was the architect and Dave was the artist

to be fair, that list was pretty much bs. Jeff Buckley was ranked #30 or something like that, and he was probably the most talented rock vocalist of the 1990's; much better than Vedder. Chris Cornell is probably﻿ the only equivalent singer from that decade.

"Eddie id fukin shit singer..... the truth..... u﻿ know it.... stop fukin lying to urself u losers"....See the part where you call people that disagree with you losers? What gives you the right to diss their opinions? Besides, when trying to act high and mighty you should probably do a better job with spelling. As to you never losing an argument, well, if you asked an egomaniac like Napoleon he would tell you he never lost a war.

This was an awesome performance. Eddie's vocals were perfect for this song. I couldn't﻿ help but sing along too! The guitar playing was unbelievable. Waters and Vedder were a great combination. Also this song's mood truly captured the night.

Roger Water insists that the solo be played note for note like﻿ the album recorded by David Gilmore....Dave Kilminster is an amazing guitar player that can actually do so much more then he is being allowed to do, so that it a slightly unfair comment.

The difference﻿ lies with who originates the solo and who has to copy it. The free-wheeling of the imagination being played is much different than learning to play that which is already written.

Wrong, they are open very slightly for a second or two, look closer. And regardless, it's not like he couldn't have sneaked a peek at any moment in time, including when the﻿ camera might not have been pointing at him. So moot point.

There is no point during that portion of film where his eyes are open AND he is looking at his hands, if there is can you post the time at which that happens, I only see him open his eyes to look at the crowd, he then opens his hands to correspond with the lyric "My hands felt﻿ just like two balloons" Who knows what happens when the camera is not on him, you are then entering the realm of imagination land.

not quite understanding your point. which solo: the guitar part? eddies vocals? it all sounds decent enough. some diehard floyd fans might not accept vedder or any outsider doing vocals on it. at the superbowl, a lot﻿ of people really didnt like Fergie's cover of G & R's "Sweet child of mine."

David Gilmour is my favorite guitarist and vocalist and love hearing his voice and solos probably more than anybody but, it pains me to see all the disrespect people show for Waters when, the guy took Pink Floyd into a different direction after Sid's departure. Roger took charge by writing philosophical lyrics and showing the dark side to life, being a band that doesn't sell out and, being the most different band﻿ in the world.
Just look at the respect Eddie, the band and crowd give Waters!

There shouldn't be a black or white choice between David and Roger.
And when it comes to the﻿ choice of Eddie for Comfortably numb...
Just think about his background, he's the perfect person to sing this song, when David's not around.

What I meant about my last sentence was that, Roger's﻿ stage presence and personality instantly gets respect from the crowd and band members, without being a prolific vocalist and guitar player. I have to admit that I love Roger's crazy and rugged voice. I even got choked up during the 2005 Live8 performance when they did wish you were here.

pink floyd rightfully belong up with legends such as the stones,thw who zeppelin and the beatles, and all credit to waters and vedder for contributing there time, but on a critical level waters voice hasnt﻿ stood the test of time at all, which pines me to say as pink floyd will always be my idols, and obviously being a fan of floyd im always going to be super critical of anyone singing comfortable numb. But in all seriousness good on him for giving it a go.

110 dead due to Sandy, all of whom KNEW for days the storm was coming and were given ample warning to evacuate. Where is the benefit for the over 1,000 dead in the Philippines typhoon last week, who received no warning or the survivors who will receive no government assistance? Couldn't be racism. Must be another﻿ reason. Right?

Roger﻿ seems more to me like a proud Father. Pearl jam~Eddy Vedder are here because of bands and talent like Pink Floyd. Merely the grand talent of the passed generation giving a nod to the awesome and equally talented instrument of the next generation worthy of telling its story. Art.

Hahahaha, you think eddie vedder didn't feel honored to do this song﻿ of all songs with roger waters? Wasted youth.. This music is what inspired, at very young ages, pearl jam, soundgarden, nirvana﻿ and the list goes on. Pink Floyd and many other bands from this era laid the foundation into the future of what we know as rock music today.

Love the performance, and wouldn't dare argue against the talent of either artist, but it is sad to see that waters'﻿ is losing something in his age. No shame in it though, it happens to alot of artists. Ozzy osbourne "now" can't hold a candle to ozzy "then", but he's still amazing. Same with waters.

Eddy Vedder is fantastic here, but please do not try to reduce Roger Water's contribution to music history. Pearl﻿ Jam has had creditable success but not to Pink Floyd's level, ever. It's a shame to get old to to be judged by "today's"standard. I give the man credit for wanting to contribute his talents to the cause rather than sit back in retirement. I am saddened as I see my music and sports heroes age, and me too in the mirror. Life goes on, let's no degrade former generations.

I hope that nobody seriously was﻿ thinking Roger Waters was less than a musical genius in these comments. It's sad if that's the case. This is awesome watching Eddie stand on his shoulders and create something special.

in reply to bruno boero's comment; Here are some facts for you to consider:﻿ I am a fan of Vedder/PJ and Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett. A man who is silent, but mentally inept is sad, although by being silent, people only wonder about his mental state. When you are 'that man' and make comments like, "Vedder, you are bigger than, Floyd !" I must say, bruno, you remove all doubt.

This performance moved many of its expression, it was to collect the most amount of money to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy, Roger Waters like a great showman kissed Eddie as godfather﻿ for public amusement, all worked 100%. I wish I was there .... David Gilmour. By the way, there was no good acoustics for rock concert

I am a huge fan of both Eddie Vedder and﻿ Roger Waters, and I think they were both fantastic. Sadly, Waters isn't the same as he was before, his voice hasn't survived too well after all these years and that's a big shame, his voice was a real gift. Still is good, but not great.

Roger Waters needs no help for this song trust me. I can admit it doesn't sound like the normal Roger though. Maybe it's the recording﻿ device used or he just wasn't on it that day. I can tell you Eddie Vedder was the one blessed to be with Roger, not vice versa. I love them both though.

LOL! Not compared to Gilmore or the band when they were at the same age. And there are countless recordings that make it abundantly clear. I have seen pink floyd a number of times from the late 70's and I have seen pearl Jam. There is no comparison almost no﻿ one seeing both in their prime would state that Pearl Jam was even comparable to Pink Floyd; not on any level.

David Gilmour co-wrote "Young Lust". He wrote the entire lyrics to﻿ "Comfortably Numb" and "Run Like Hell" for his own album but ended up using them in The Wall because Roger ran out of songs and liked how they fit, but Waters gets songwriting credit on the last two because of a couple lyrics.

Unless you were fortunate enough to see Floyd when they were all together you missed a tremendous opportunity. All of them were very talented. No﻿ one was better than the other. Gilmore﻿ and Waters were good together until ego got in the way. The Wall is an excellent album but my favorite will always be Dark Side I was fortunate enough to see Floyd at the Allen Theater do parts of Dark Side 2 years before the album was released. Seen their shows from the early 70's till the end of Floyd

That is false. Roger wrote all the music on the﻿ Wall except Run Like Hell, and Comfortably Numb. David and the rest of the floyd had a hand in arrangement and things of that nature, but it was Roger's idea and Roger's baby. Although without Gilmour Pink floyd would surely lack.

Yeah, Paul really needs some association from the 80s to pull him up. Maybe Novoselic taught him a few﻿ new licks.

I think they did a great job on this song. However, I still think that much of "The﻿ Wall" could have been written by Syd Barrett himself, especially "Waiting For The Worms".

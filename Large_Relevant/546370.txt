Mall Shooter Was Hawaii-BoundBy NEAL KARLINSKY and COLLEEN CURRY | ABC News – Wed, Dec 12, 2012

In the days before he stole a semiautomatic weapon and stormed into an Oregon shopping mall, killing two people in a shooting spree, Jacob Roberts quit his job, sold his belongings and began to seem "numb" to those closest to him.


Roberts' ex-girlfriend, Hannah Patricia Sansburn, 20, told ABC News today that the man who donned a hockey mask and opened fire on Christmas shoppers was typically happy and liked to joke around, but abruptly changed in the week before the shooting.


Roberts unleashed a murderous volley of gunfire on the second floor of the Clackamas Town Center on Tuesday while wearing the mask and black clothing, and carrying an AR-15 semiautomatic weapon and "several" magazines full of ammunition. He ended his barrage by walking down to the first floor of the mall and committing suicide.

"I don't understand," Sansburn said. "I was just with him. I just talked to him. I didn't believe it was him at all. Not one part of me believed it."


She said that in recent weeks, Roberts quit his job at a gyro shop in downtown Portland and sold all of his belongings, telling her that he was moving to Hawaii. He had even purchased a ticket.


She now wonders if he was really planning to move.


"He  was supposed to catch a flight Saturday and I texted him, and asked how his flight went, and he told me, 'oh, I got drunk and didn't make the flight,'" she said. "And then this happens... It makes me think, was he even planning on going to Hawaii? He quit his job, sold all of his things."


Roberts described himself on his Facebook page as an "adrenaline junkie," and said he is the kind of person who thinks, "I'm going to do what I want."


Roberts, who attended Clackamas Community college, posted a picture of himself on his Facebook page firing a gun at a target. His Facebook photo showed graffiti in which the words "Follow Your Dreams" were painted over with the word "Cancelled."


Sansburn said the pair had dated for nearly a year but had broke up over the summer. Throughout their relationship, she had never seen him act violently or get angry.


"Jake was never the violent type. He didn't go out of his way to try to hurt people or upset people. His main goal was to make you laugh, smile, make you feel comfortable. I never would have guessed him to do anything like this ever," she said.


"You can't reconcile the differences. I hate him for what he did, but I can't hate the person I knew because it was nothing like the person who would go into a mall and go on a rampage. I would never associate the two at all."


The last time she saw him, which was last week, he "seemed numb," and she didn't understand why, she said.


"I just talked to him, stayed the night with him, and he just seemed numb if anything. He's usually very bubbly and happy, and I asked him why, what had changed, and said 'nothing.' He just had so much he had to do before he went to Hawaii that he was trying to distance himself from Portland," Sansburn said.


Sansburn said the last message she sent Roberts was a text, asking him to stay, and saying she didn't want him to leave. He replied "I'm sorry," with a sad face emoticon.


Police are still seeking information about what Roberts was doing in the days leading up to the shooting. They said today they believe Roberts stole the gun he used in the rampage from someone he knew. They have searched his home and his car for other clues into his motive.

Clackamas County Sheriff Craig Roberts said earlier today on "Good Morning America" that he believes Roberts went into the mall with the goal of killing as many people as he could.


"I believe, at least from the information that's been provided to me at this point in time, it really was a killing of total strangers. To my knowledge at this point in time he was really trying, I think, to kill as many people as possible."


Sansburn said she has not talked to police.




Mall Shooter Told Ex-Girlfriend He Was Moving to Hawaii

Roberts' mother, Tami Roberts, released a statement through a friend today saying she had no explanation of her son's behavior.


"Tami Roberts wishes to express her shock and grief at the events at Clackamas Town Center Tuesday," the friend said, reading from a statement outside of Tami Roberts' home.


The friend noted that Tami raised Roberts, but was not his biological mother. Sansburn said that Roberts' biological mother had died when he was very young.


"She has no understanding or explanation for her son's behavior...It's so out of his character," the friend said.


Officials from the Oregon City School District, where Roberts graduated from Oregon City High School, were also surprised at the news.


"This news is very shocking to those who knew Jacob while at OCHS. He was known as a soft spoken and polite young man who was often eager to be helpful. The motive for such a horrific act is likely to remain a mystery to us all," the district said in a statement.


Roberts had attended the school for only his senior year. He spent three years at Milwaukie High School, where officials described him as an "average student with average grades."


He had no disciplinary record at the school, but chose to transfer for his senior year to Oregon City High School, according to Joe Krumm, an administrator at the North Clackamas School District. Krumm did not know why he transferred, and said that in all, Roberts did not stand out in memory for anything in particular.

Kudos to the people who work in that mall who took their training drills seriously, kept a cool head, and got people out of harm's way.  Much love and prayers for the families of those who were killed, and I hope the injured person pulls through and recovers.

That most important thing said, a side note; using a story like this to insult members of whichever political party you're against is just lame.   There's a time and place for political arguments, but not here.  Have some class or learn some class. This is a story about people who lost loved ones, about how some people's actions prevented more from getting killed, and about how someone who seemed normal seemed to snap.  I pray that never happens to anyone you or I know.

I know there may be no sympathy here, but I feel for the parent(s) of this murderer. It is easy to say "upbringing this and upbringing that" but just for a second.....close your eyes and imagine what would you say and how would you react if your child or someone you were very close to did something like this. Poor parent(s).

Well whatever the case something certainly short-circuited in his head.

He fired 60 rounds and only killed two people besides himself. Doesn't sound to me as if his heart was really into a massacre. Even the worst of marksmen could have taken out a larger number than that, firing into crowds of shoppers. What sort of pain would drive a young man to commit such a crime?

I find it interesting that there are all of these kind, intelligent people who would on a normal day wouldn't harm a fly and all of a sudden they kill a bunch of people. To me, that's suspicious and makes me wonder why this is the case and why it's becoming a lot more common. What exactly is going on which makes intellectual people snap like this? Will you or I snap one day? I don't know and it's unlikely but the question remains to be answered to why this is happening.  Perhaps sociological stress? Drugs? Manipulation or Hypnotism?

his change in personality is quite a red flag.  Sounds like he may have been bi-polar or manic depressive or suffered from schizophrenia.  Mental illness definitely got the best of him.  Some of these types of mental illnesses don't show up until your in your early 20s.  I've known a few people who live with being manic or being bi-polar.  It was so bad that they were placed in a psych ward.  The meds definitely helped.  I don't think all of them have violent tendencies, but there are major ups and downs and being out of touch with reality is standard, thinking you're on a grander level.

My heart goes out to all of the families and the people who were at the mall.  More people need to be educated about symptoms of mental illness and learn to somehow recognize when someone is or might be suicidal.  Mental illness is very real.  I had a family member pass away from suicide, no violence against others ever occurred thank goodness.  I'm guessing that this happens more with males.

"She said that in recent weeks, Roberts quit his job at a gyro shop in downtown Portland and sold all of his belongings, telling her that he was moving to Hawaii. He had even purchased a ticket."

These are things that people who are on the precipice of a suicide attempt often do.I read this not too long ago. Of course, sometimes people who are just relocating do them, but this guy was also exhibiting other behavioral giveaways, such as missing his flight "accidentally" because he was intoxicated, acting "numb" before he went on his homicide/ suicide spree, etc. 

Seems like this guy always appeared even to his friends to never have any problems and to never be particularly bothered by anything. Maybe sometimes that it also an indication somebody is avoiding dealing with what might be some serious psychological undercurrents.

Couldn't he have just committed suicide instead of ruining the lives of innocent people?

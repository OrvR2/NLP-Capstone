Type 1 diabetes rising in kids - studyBy Trevor Stokes | Reuters – 12 hrs ago

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Cases of insulin-requiring type 1 diabetes rose sharply in children under the age of five in Philadelphia over a two-decade span - similar to increases seen across the U.S. and Europe, according to new research.
              "Why are we seeing this large increase in type 1 diabetes in very young children? Unfortunately, the answer is we don't know," said lead study author Terri Lipman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing.
              In research published in Diabetes Care, Lipman and her colleagues updated a registry started in 1985 of Philadelphia children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.
              By 2004, cases in children under the age of five increased by 70 percent as the number of diagnosed cases among all kids up to age 14 rose by 29 percent.
              In 1985, 13.4 out of every 100,000 children in Philadelphia was newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and in 2004, the rate was 17.2 cases per 100,000.
              Hispanic children had the highest diabetes rates across all ages whereas cases in black children aged 4 and under, which had historically been very low, rose by 200 percent over the past two decades. Cases among white kids under 4 rose by 48 percent in 2000-2004, however, making theirs the fastest recent increase.
              Of the two most common forms of diabetes, type 2 typically affects adults who can still produce insulin, but whose bodies cannot use the hormone to regulate blood sugar. Type 1, previously known as juvenile diabetes, typically strikes children whose immune systems have killed off insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. The disease is usually fatal if left untreated.
              Type 1 diabetics must take insulin but many type 2 diabetics can control the disease with medications, diet and exercise.
              Type 1 diabetes tends to start in adolescence, but especially in light of the rising number of cases in very young children, experts said parents need to be aware that toddlers and preschoolers are also susceptible.
              Children from Chicago to Colorado to Finland have similarly increased rates of type 1 diabetes, though the cause eludes researchers.
              "This younger group is a mystery," said Dr. Carol Levy, a type 1 diabetes specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who was not involved in the new study. "Make sure your child has a healthy lifestyle and maintains normal body weight; whether that's a guarantee we're going to reduce risk, we don't know at this point."
              Several theories vie to explain the recent rise in diabetes among youth, including vitamin D deficiencies, lack of breastfeeding and overly-hygienic environments that might cause the immune system to backfire.
              "The data is controversial so that's why I'm certainly very reluctant to propose a theory when nothing has been proven," Lipman told Reuters Health.
              "The take home message is not to be alarmist. These data confirm what has been reported worldwide and in other parts of the United States," said Dr. Lori Laffel, of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, who was not involved in the study.
              "It is important to be aware of the symptoms of diabetes," Laffel told Reuters Health. Symptoms can include extreme thirst, bed wetting or accidents in toilet-trained children or excessively wet diapers in babies, she said.
              By the time the disease gets diagnosed, many infants and toddlers are very sick and the degree of illness tends to be more severe the younger the patient, experts noted.
              "The young child isn't able to talk about symptoms," Laffel said. "A young child may be in diapers, you may not notice because diapers are often wet."

Please do not think for one second that type 1 child got diabetes because they lived an unhealthy lifestyle. My child is 4 and always ate healthy and was active. Some of your comments are astoundingly ignorant. My child, nor myself or lifestyle caused her to have this horrible disease that she fights and will have to fight for the rest of her life. Type 1 is soooooooo different than type 2. Educate yourselves and pray that you never have this happen to someone you love.

hugs Amanda... hope you have a pump for your little one. people are ignorant, type 1 is totally different then type 2. type 1's are less then 5-10% of the entire diabetic population for those that don't know already. 56 years as a type 1. a supreme court justice is a type 1 too. don't lose hope, you did nothing to cause this.

Just some clarification about T1D. My 5 year old was very active and ate a very balanced diet. She was actually underweight at diagnosis.  "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which a person's pancreas stops producing insulin, a hormone that enables people to get energy from food. IT OCCURS WHEN THE BODY'S IMMUNE SYSTEM ATTACKS AND DESTROYS the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, called beta cells. IT'S ONSET HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DIET OR LIFESTYLE. There is nothing you can do to prevent T1D, and-at present-nothing you can do to get rid of it."----JDRF

how about the fukashima reactors? radiation would be carried along trade winds globally. this is not just a US problem. radiation can kill off lots of body cells including beta cells. no beta cells means type 1 diabetes. they are dead! means injected insulin or dead in 3-5 days without any food.

I have had Type I since age five. The disorder was a big deal back then with a lot support and awareness campaigns. That was before the fat white man's disease (Type II) began getting all the media attention and funding. If the numbers go up, maybe they'll start putting serious money into finding a cure again. I'm hoping for something based on stem cells personally.

It seems to me environmental toxins and hormone mimics could be a possible culprit in the increase in type 1 diabetes or any other autoimmune disease. On a chemical level many toxins have as little a 1 different connection (bond style) then it's natural counterpart but that can drastically change how the body sees it.

"Why are we seeing this large increase in type 1 diabetes in very young children? Unfortunately, the answer is we don't know,
It's from the vaccines.

I can tell you. Vaccinations! Stop vaccinating kids 40 times before the age of 10. You pump kids full of vaccines with 'dead' diseases and suspended in formaldehyde and lead based solutions to get their systems to produce antibodies and it causes their bodies to attack and destroy the insulin producing cells in the pancreas. Do a study on that. My daughter was diagnosed at the age of 13 months so don't tell me about 'lifestyles'. AND she only got a fraction of the vaccinations kids are getting now.
